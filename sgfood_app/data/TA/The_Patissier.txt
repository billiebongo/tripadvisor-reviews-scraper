I came in a bit of a rush but they had everything available and all packaged for me to go. Lovely service every time I go and super tasty cakes!

I came to know this shop from the Google search and decided to give a try since it was one of the top 5 recommended cake shop in Singapore. Indeed, no disappointment. The signature Passionfruit meringue was simply superb. Light but yet delicious.

my favorite cake shop! loved all their cakes! esp the passion fruit meringue.
they have friendly and helpful staffs! Thumbs up!

They are one of the best. With many dessert shop sprouting out, the patissier still stands out. Green tea cake or chocolate opera cake is our favourite. Remember to order in advance!

I tried to order a cake on their website a day ahead but the date was pre-set 4 days ahead. Fortunately, they are flexible enough to accept my order via phone though I wasn’t too comfortable of providing my credit card details over phone.The delivery fees was $20++, almost 50% higher than the 500g cake I reserved. So I opted to pick up from their premises at Mohd Sultan Road. The bakery is located at the T-Junction, and there is no pedestrian crossing, so you have to jay-walk.The Cacao Napoleon cake is average. The biscuits base is waffle like & very hard to cut. I also bought too small cakes - Empress Dowagers & another one that looks like red velvet. The latter tasted weird but the Empress Dowagers was pretty delicious with strawberries mousses layered with sponge and filled with crushed raspberries. The mousses was melt in the mouth soft, with a just nice blend of raspberry sourness & sweetness from the cake

Tasted one bite in a company birthday party and can’t stop thinking about it. Took 3 MRT lines and cannot help to buy a 6” instead of the original plan of just 2 slices. We (2 pax) finished the whole cake in one night. The passionfruit meringue cake is the best cake I have ever had

The Passionfruit Meringue Cake is out of this world. I had all along associated Meringue dessert as something loaded with sugar and ultra sweet but the Passionfruit Meringue Cake proved me wrong. The top meringue layer was not thick. It was not sweet for a cake. The fresh cream tasted like the expensive , better quality type. The cubes of passionfruit, mango and strawberry added a well-balanced citrus taste to the cake. The fruits truly enhanced the overall gastronomical delight. I was only not supposed to consume cakes due to health reason; however, I ended up eating one-quarter (or more) of the delicious cake. A 6" round cake costs $48.15. According to my friend, delivery is possible. I like this service. Happy Birthday, MJ ! Another occasion to remember !

My gf ordered a cake today with collection slated for this Sun. After order we decided to change the collection day (few hours after first order) to a later date. For the change (which do not impact them in any way), they imposed an admin charge on us. Too bad we already left our cc details with them. Go in with your eyes plan open!

My favourite cake is their Passion Fruit Meringue Central. Its still the only cake which will give me this kind of blissful feeling with satisfaction. However, the cons is you have to eat it on the day. Otherwise, the cake will not be that fresh and the crispy layer (Meringue) will be soften

For a rich, scrumptous and special cake - this is the place to go. Recommended by some of the best cake makers in Singapore, you won't get disappointed.
Pur your order in early so you don't miss out.

Meringue was very very excellent. Very light combination of cream and fruits. Not cheap though. Makes a very special birthday cake or cake for simply any occasion.

cakes were overrated and not nice at all. everyone raved about it but what i had were tough cake and it wasn't as tasty as cakes made by my grandma

When is this ever open?
When it's open they 'just ran out' of food, but usually it's closed. And I live next door but in over a year I haven't been able to eat there once.

The cakes are lovely and delicious. THey are a bit expensive though. Also have cake decorating workshops for kids that are really fun. Staff are very friendly.

Decided to have a different birthday cake right. Got the mango one. I love cakes but this one disappointed me so much. I didn't even want a second slice.
5
Omg! Excellent Passionfruit Meringue EVER!! My hubby loved it for his birthday! Thank you so much for your kind and thoughtful service! After cutting the slices for me, my son and the helper, he finished the cake because he said it was SO good! Thank you very much! :)

Love all their cakes, they never disappoint both in terms of flavour and aesthetics. Although more pricey than other cake shops in the market, their flavours are top notch and their creations truly taste as good as it looks.Ive had to throw away many 3D cakes from other bakeries after cutting them (mostly tasted of icing and artificial colouring) but not after discovering The Patissier. Highly recommended

Uniquely crafted creations that redefine cakes and pastries! Favourites are the passionfruit meringue and strawberry shortcake. It is also very convenient to order on-line or by phone.The prices are relatively high - One slice of cake costs around S$8 so you won't really be wanting to eat these too often! The service could be improved as it tends to be somewhat condescending

We are regular customer of this cake shop... usually they will call up and check on online order but this time round they do not. Our address is indicate wrongly which we requested to waive off the additonal charges of SGD19.20 but the Manager (who claimed she is the owner of this shop) will just waive off SGD8.50 which it just a form of 'entertainment' toward us.Â She claimed her driver got ORDERS in his truck which his driver called and told us left our order in the truck. He is in BEDOK area and our area is in CHANGI. The reason she given is he need to go back for other area but our order can be deliver before 1pm. She do not realise her staff have told us delivery time is 2-5pm and most important that her staff can just read out the correct address to us without we telling her

we really like the cakes and the profiteroles from The patissier.
It was a bit expansive but the quality is here.
the design was well done.

Only tried 2 small cakes to go - pretty good stuff will order a big one next time...
3
Rather neutral on this. Used it for my princess 1st month, cup cakes, brownies and ginger bread. Nice and cute design but terribly sweet...

Love the cakes!

Yummiest Meringue

Yummy cakes that are simply divine! The pastries look like works of art.. So pretty that I almost can't bear to eat them but when you do, they taste SOooo good.
4
For past few years, I only buy whole cakes from here.

Just in case tourists read this and think this is a restaurant, it is not! It's a cake shop. A really fancy one, but still a cake shop nevertheless. Have no particular favourites, try a different cake each time. They are mostly good. The owner/baker and her team are knowledgeable, passionate and creative, so certainly a force to be reckoned with. Just a little shocked that this is listed as 1 of the top 10 "restaurants" in Singapore. it's a cake sho

My wife ordered a golf themed cake for her dad a couple of months ago in April and it's quite nicely done up with the golf decorations with profitaroles on top. It tastes good, looks good but exp. I think was about S$120-150 for a small cake? About 1-1.5kg
5
I recently ordered two cakes here for my birthday. The Double Pralines Chocolate and the Chocolate Fudge (I love chocolate). Both were very good indeed, definitely better than most other cakes in Singapore, however I expected the difference to be more than what it was given the prices
5
Awesome cakes. 2 cakes from the Patissier in a week :). Love me tender was cool with its White Choc. The strawberry shortcake was light and tasty. Yumz.
4
Must try the Passion Fruit Meringue.
Very light and totally yummy. Luv that its not too sweet and perfect for dessert even after a heavy meal.

overrated.
5
Definitely the best pastry shop in town. Top marks for presentation. Unlike many other cake shops, the cakes here taste as good as they look. Some of their selections remind me of the ones from my favourite French patisserie in the Bastille section of Paris.

Brilliant cakes. abit expensive

The chocolate cakes here are wondrous creations, but being a purist that I am, I'll skip the east-meet-west chocolate concoctions served here. Which leaves me with not much choices in the end...

Good
