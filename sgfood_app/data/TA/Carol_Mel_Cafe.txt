One of the better cafes I have been to in singapore. Quiet, and the tables are spaced out so we have verbal privacy when talking and chatting with my friends. Will be back for another drink.

Two barely cooked eggs each, slice of bacon, 20grams of salad, one cherry tomato, one slice of bread, and some smoke fish ..
7 dollars worth
What a shame ...

Good coffee and ice-cream waffles; with a good ambience. Staff are attentive and friendly, and yet not intrusive~

#batamliciouzinsg . Save this must try hidden gem yooo. I am so loving this simple and cozy cafe. They serve some creative and fantastic food and drinks..Seriously, all the food shown in the video are delicious! I enjoyed every one of them and that is pretty rare. Cheesy truffle hashbrown was on point. The lamb was super tender. Rakuten cold noodle was a surprising favorite (I usually don’t like cold noodle)..You guys really should try their Salted Egg Spam Fries and Durian Creme Brulee. Both are limited availability. Then their drinks are so unique and fun. Not to mention their latte art was such an eye candy➖➖➖➖➖PRICE: $5 - 20 (average).LOCATION: @carol_mel_cafe- The Commerze @ Irving #01-30, 1 Irving Pl, Singapore- Nearest MRT: Tai Seng (Orange Line) a close walk.HOURS⏰:- M-F: 12:00 - 21:00- Sat: 11:00 - 21:00- Sun: 11:00 - 16:00➖➖➖➖

With all of the press hype, there was quite a wait for a coffee (even in the evening) but all the latte art we saw was individualised and beautiful (we did not order any food). You have to go on the head barista’s instagram (@damien_tc) and pick out a design. Go for the pictures if that’s your kind of thing

I'm surprised there's only 1 other review on Carol Mel here - there are quite a no. on other sites like hungrygowhere!We visited due to the kopipass and decided to have our dinner here as well, due to the good reviews we'd read.Once we arrived, we were promptly seated and also served chilled water, which was refilled promptly. The decor was homely and we had cushions where we sat! Also noticed some games in the shelves; not sure if they allowed customers to use those while having their meal. While we were there, there was a constant flow of guests into the cafe, a sign of good food/ambience as it is not exactly in a 'hot' location!We were deciding between the duck confit, buttermilk waffles with cheesy curry chicken katsu (can't recall the exact name), and lamb shank. We eventually did not order the lamb shank as it was prepared with wine. Additionally, we ordered the mid-wings.The mid-wings came first - they were hot and spiced and served with maple syrup that came in a separate mini jug. As my husband said, they tasted good with or without the maple syrup. I was pleasantly surprised as I'd initially thought it was a strange combination! My husband loved them so much, I had to let him eat 4 out of the 6 mid-wings. =pFor the kopipass drink, we ordered the hot latte and it came with lovely art that included my husband's name! So wow-ed when I discovered that (have to admit, we didn't really look at it when it first arrived as we were busy with the food)! Lovely touch and attention to detail! =)The duck confit came with salad and aglio olio. Skin was crisp and the duck was flavourful, if a bit dry for my husband's liking. I thought it was just nice and also loved the aglio olio that was simple and tasty and came with generous garnishing, though a more common pairing would be mashed potato.My husband tried the buttermilk waffles without the chicken first and LOVED it. At the end of the meal, he said he could have happily eaten the waffles on their own! The curry is the mild, Japanese type and maple syrup was also given as an accompaniment. I'm not a waffles lover, but these are arguably the best I've tasted! Hot and crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside..Tastiest with just a drizzle of maple syrup, in my opinion!I was full by then and tried my best, but could not prevent my husband from ordering 2 more waffles for dessert - 1 plain and 1 with 2 scoops of ice-cream..Although the 2 flavours we wanted were not available (creme brulee and salted caramel), the 2 we eventually ordered (Italian yoghurt and chocolate brownie?) were nice replacements.Planning to return again soon to try out the rest of the menu, and of course order more waffles

Homely cafe with beautiful ornaments as decorations. The food was delicious at really affordable prices. Totally felt in love with the addictive salted egg luncheon fries that was crispy yet moist on the inside. The Rakuzen cold pasta was another favourite with a medley of seafood on chilled angel hair pasta. Another highlight is the beautiful latte art for each cup of coffee ordered! Second visit and pleased with the food there
