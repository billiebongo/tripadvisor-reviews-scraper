I ordered BBQ Pork Rice at Harbourfront branch. The food is served in take out bowl container. Serving is good, taste is good but no wow factor. Its just okay. The price is average and okay to fill in your hungry stomach.

Laksa was flavorful and one of the better tasting we have had in Singapore. Their pork BBQ buns were ok but not nearly comparable to the ones at Tim Ho Wan. Beef Rice was average to good.

A quick meal after a checkin at T1 singapore at ruyi is an average experience.
It was a decent meal package for 10 sgd and food was okie. I loved the mango custard which was really nice.

My friends and I decided to eat at Ruyi because of their set meal prices. The set I ordered consisted of: Stewed Minced Pork Rice with Egg, Coke and a Mango Pudding. For $9.80, it was very worth it. Do take note that depending on the drink you want, you might need to top up a bit more cash. The veggies were too salty for my taste though.Ruyi currently only has a store at Resort World Sentos

I am not a tourist but a loxal ruyi food is not worth the price too expensive and the main ingredients are never found in the food.the noodles have so few meat n small tiny ridiculous prawns thrown in n thats it...if I buy noodle with egg lunxgein meat fishcake comes to about 2 or 3 dollars n its very delicious...have the cgefs tasted the food but sorry we are not inrerested in eating bland worthless food with few bits of ingredients thrown in do I have to pay 7 bucks for just barely nothin

The food was tasty and served quickly. We thought the way in which they displayed their menu was impressive, individual portions on a plate gave us an insight as to what our meal would be like. This we thought was a good idea for those who weren't certain what they would be getting from reading the menu

After shopping at Bengawan Solo, we need to find something to eat quick before going inside the departure hall. Found this noodles restaurants - Ruyi. We ordered laksa noodles and bbq pork/dumpling noodles and some pan fried dumplings. it's very yummy and we had enjoyed the food before departed Singapore :
