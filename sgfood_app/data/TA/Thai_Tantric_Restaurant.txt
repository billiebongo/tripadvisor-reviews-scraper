My usual go-to place for Thai whenever I'm in the area. Price is reasonable and food tastes good. Gets packed during regular lunch and dinner hours.

This place is tucked in a corner in orchard towers, and you must pass a bunch of massage shops to find this place. Its one of the best thai food i have tasted in Singapore.

1. Pricing is slightly more for this eatery, possibly at Orchard Road area (eg. Sea bass $35 vs others $28-30; meat dishes $12; fried rice/noodles $8... beverages are OK at $2)...it attracts good lunch crowd coming here for Thai food “fix”.2. Personally I find the dishes are not too spicy. I love their spicy chicken wings!3. Service is courteous and prompt.4. Location (Orchard Towers) not too conducive for single ladies especially if you enter from main entrance area ...however, you can use side entrance adjacent to 7-11 convenient store, up a few steps and take the lift to 3rd floor, and lift opens and bring you to the eatery

This restaurant lacked ventilation and was extremely foul smelling!!! The moment I sat inside for a while I kind of lost my appetite. When my colleagues’ food came along, the waiter’s oily and dirty hand prints was marked on the plates but still we couldn’t get rid of it completely.I had the fried beef hor fun and there was such a strong taste of alcohol or gasoline. It tasted so bad and inedible I just could not eat it anymore after a mouthful. Worst Thai food experience in my whole life. It wasn’t even cheap at all

If you are looking for affordable Thai food, Thai Tantric is one you should consider going. It's not exactly cheap like in food court or hawker, it is affordable if you want good but reasonable prices. There is another Thai restaurant in Orchard Towers as well, but Thai Tantric is definitely a better one. A good example is the green curry chicken in Thai Tantric. If you compared what Thai Tantric serves and what the other Thai restaurant serves, you will be surprised that for just one simple, popular dish, how different both restaurants serve this dish. Thai Tantric's green curry chicken is so much thicker and the portion is much more generous! They are good with other dishes as well.  Thai Tantric is a slightly smaller restaurant compared to the other. Service is great too!

Good Thai staples - yum wun Sen, som tum, green chicken curry, laab, but could be a bit more spicy as barely a tickle at the back of the throat. Deep fried bass and chicken wings were really tasty - crisp and meaty. About SGD20 per head with a beer or two each. It's Orchard Towers, but just keep on going, eyes front, and you'll come through unscathed.

The serving was big . The tom yum soup , green curry chicken and pineapple rice . The steamed garlic lime seabass was not authentic . No sugar was added to my iced Thai Tea but it tasted extremely bitter and left an overbearing tannin taste on my tongue for quite some time . I ordered the steamed garlic line seabass, green curry chicken and pineapple rice today. The bill came up to be $58 for three dishes

This time I brought my Thai colleague here, wondering are these food also good for Thai people. Since he can speak fluent Thai, he took the order. We ordered green curry, pork slice, (these two are my always favorite), clear soup tomyam (my Thai colleague highly recommend this), stir fry kailan and Brasil leaves mince meat.Green curry is the same milky and yummy, they serve a lot of vege and chicken. We hardly can finish the big bowl of gravy, although it is so nice to eat with rice! We added extra rice, still there are more than enough gravy. Pork slice with spicy sauce, must order! Crispy outside, tender meat inside. It also goes very well with rice. Kailan, mince meat all are also nice dishes. Can't wait to go back and try more. Good job Thai tantric

I've heard about this place from friends and colleagues so I decided to have lunch and try it out. Not the same restaurant that you can find in malls and high establisments but you know that a lot of people going and eat here. I was surprised bcoz its really cheap and affordable and not only that it's delicious which can compare with Thai restaurant.I'll coming back to try other menu.
