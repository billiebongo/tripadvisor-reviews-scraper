Great and simple selection of beverages. Cool place to people watch. No pressure to buy more to stay longer. Just a bit noisy from the passing buses. But like I said, it's a good spot for people watching.

The breakfast was really good! I also enjoyed the friendly atmosphere.
The coffee was great and also the toast they made.
I was at this place because the place I was heading to was closed. Got suprised! ðŸ˜Š

Great service by the lovely staff, fantastic coffee and nice little bites to eat any time of the day.

Like itâ€™s namesake. I think that Shan Cha should stick to making tea. They ran out of milk the first time I went there to grab coffee (understandable). But when I went back again (to give them the benefit of doubt) it took forever for them to come and serve me - they were barely five meters from the counter. And with my order? It wasnâ€™t a flat white. It was a goddamn latte
