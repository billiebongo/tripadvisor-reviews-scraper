Good ambience and very moderately priced drinks. Food took a while to come but tasted good. The manger’s service more than made up for the delay

We had it at the other outlet-82 club street
Bad service is understatement and the food is burnt.
Cook (they don't deserve chef title) did not take the comment well and wanting to explain the situation.
Ran out of veggies?
Not going to be back.

I have always enjoyed the food and drinks at this place. But service is what needs to be worked upon. Last night was the worst in terms of service.

Went there for drinks. Great idea to sell whole bottles which you can then consume on the premises. There are a range of drinks and varied pricing to suit most budgets.

That’s a signature stop for any visit in Singapore. In the heart of the fabulous Club street you may enjoy great food and kind service. The wine section is not so amazing as it is advertised, but still you can have some good shouts.

if u want your customer to spend more money in one visit, you should do every $25 dollars to get a stamp. I hope your marketing team give it a thought.

Nice pub to sit and relax with a good bottle of wine. The pub offers an impressive selection of international wines and spirits at prices which are very reasonable for Singapore. All wines are put up on a huge shelf on one of the walls for the customers to select. The friendly and very knowledgeable stuff will be very happy to support you with good advice for finding the right wine

I was looking forward to a nice time at Drinks&Co with my visiting friends. Unfortunately, it wasn't the case. This is a wine place with a staff that obviously has no training or interest in wine. I asked about Malbec and Rioja, the lady didn't even know these types of wine existed..?! Then, we ordered pizzas, the saddest margarita pizza I have even seen.. The cheese wasn't even covering two third of the tomato base on some slices and two crippled tiny crippled basil leaves were mean to bring additional flavor. We sent it back explaining why.. Well they (the chef apparently) simply returned it saying that he wasn't preparing another one - adding cheese and putting back to cook a few minutes would have sufficed. We refused and got cheese on the side to sprinkle in the bare areas of the slices. It still looked and tasted like a lame margarita. Then when paying the bill, we had 3 cards, they refused and said they could only take 2 cards for payments. No explanation and no choice given again. For sure, my visiting friends didn't get fun they had signed up for. I won't be going back

Overall we had a really bad experience. The waiter started by saying calamari is a vegetarian option!! We ignored that but then it went downhill from there. The place was not that crowded but the service was beyond that horrible. They would take 15 mins to even come to our table and then another 15 to get simple things like water. The staff is rude and clearly overworked.This was my first and last visit

now moved to 81 Club Street I tried ordering champagne. They said they couldn't serve it but I could go into the shop and pick it up, give it to them and then they would serve it! Bizarre! So a bottle that would normally cost $130 cost only $71 and they still had to chill it and serve it. Exactly how is that good commercial sense and how is that customer friendly? Yet the second bottle i ordered I didn't need to do this!! How does that make any sense?We ordered a couple of large sharing items which never came, the rest of the good was fine but nothing great, atmosphere was fine outside, service was weird, we had three servers in 90 minutes....none of which appeared to talk to each other...

The Staff Attitude was Appauling. Wen we got there. Took them about 20 min get our drinks served. Could understand if it was busy. Only 3tables in Inc us.

Club street offers various options for drinks but my personal favourite is drinks&co. It has a very good selection of drinks and gives you the option to buy by the bottle which considerably reduced the cost of your visit. This is an option a lot of the patrons take advantage of so there's always an aura of easy going fun mostly because the waiting staff are not overwhelmed with loads of orders. Off you do decide to stay on beers or single drink orders the service is usually very quick. There are options for food and nibbles (provided by the sister drinks & co kitchen further down the road) which look good and are also very reasonably priced. I have only had the chicken wings which were good enough but nothing exceptional

Singapore can break you in a hurry, if you like to drink alcohol and hang out in the trendy spots, or those with great service and a view. Drinks & Co is an exception. They sell by the bottle and its a hybrid of self serve and table service. They have got it just right! You can go out with a group, get just the service you need at a price that wont make you cry, and leave you enough to come back again for another visit. The location in Ann Siang makes it a hot spot nowadays, so you can enjoy the sights of the younger, working crowd - working hard and playing hard in one of the great cities of the world

This review is for Drinks & Co Kitchen in Holland Village. It is situated along Lorong Mambong with other f&b outlets. With the evening road closure, the place is a busy night market. What first attracted us was a staff who claimed that their drinks was the cheapest around.Another attraction is their clean cut layout with racks of wines for you to choose versus mulling over a list. Their wines are mainly new world and quite good value for money. I haven't seen Ravenswood wines for a while and they have a good selection.They also have a good selection of food. We like the wagyu meatballs and pork rib sliders. Their grilled vegetables was more like stirred fried with oyster sauce though. We kept seeing trays of their signature platters being served and they looked very tempting.Besides the rackful of wines, they also serve craft beers. Service is very friendly. Certainly not your usual watering hole and a place to visit and frequent

Drinks & Co is a nice spot - great ambience and recommend for a casual night out.The selection of wines is very good and very well priced. The food menu is also good - plenty of variety and good value.Service is friendly but can sometimes be a little slow. If you aren't in a hurry this place is well worth a visit

My bestfriend brought me here and I fell in love. The service was tip top and they helped my friends and I with whatever they could. They had some great food too! I totally love the Truffle fries! Affordable and relaxing atmosphere! Been there twice and will definitely comes back

We visited the Drinks & Co. in Holland Village. It's a great venue as it has a large outdoor space. The wines are excellent value with a fairly broad range, in addition to beers and other drinks. The Tapas were 2 for 1 during happy hour. We tried the meatballs, chicken wings, lamb chops & bruschetta. All were very good and reasonable sized portions.
2
The staff was ridiculously rude, didn't welcome us with seats or a menu, instead just asked obnoxiously, " what u want?" The drinks were fine and priced alright but everything wrong with the staff's attitude. Not all of them of them but two of them were extremely mean. One of the rude staff even refused to split the bill between two cards with a lame excuse that the machine wasn't working. When requested to a different staff member it was accepted without questions. Nice place but ruined by a horrible experience. Never again!

Liquor store that also doubles as a watering hole. No frills kind of place, with low prices on bottles of booze and small plates. Staff is nice and friendly, but play it fast and loose on service, but hey, that's why you're there no.Selection on liquor and wine is OK and covers the basics and then some, but is far from exhaustive. You'll find something for yourself for sure though. Closes early, even on weekends. Something to keep in mind
5
A fantastic, casual venue for a relaxing tipple of your favourite wine and/or spirit. Their wine selection stretches across the four corners of the globe, which changes constantly due to varying supply. An excellent spirit selection also, with some rare beauties to be found. Pricing is affordable, given it is in Singapore, but it's the range and overall ambience that has won me over. A must-try
5
A great bar with great prices
Disrupting the bar scene in Singapore with good service
They now serve food, through their sister bar across the road
keep up the good work

The have the best value for money spirits. Come down if you like spirits that is value for money. Lots of variety to choose from

I celebrated my Bday last year at this bar. It's the place to go if you want to start the night with cheap drink bottles in the busy area of Club Street. I suggest to reserve tables before coming in as this place is always packed with people. They have a wide selection range of wines, and other drinks Like vodka or whiskey in a very affordable price. this is a perfect venue for occasions like Bdays and company events.Highly recommended !
4
Drinks & Co is the perfect place to go with a couple of mates or colleagues for almost any occasion! I first came a few ears ago for a New Year's Eve, and have since come back quite a few times, most recently for a friend's birthday. I would advise making a booking beforehand or coming early as it is quite a small venue, but otherwise no issues! The concept is really smart, especially for Singapore, and prices aren't at all unreasonable! I'll be back soon for sure :

Pretty good selection of drinks - liquor, wine, and some beers/ ciders too. Casual - friendly ambience that will make you forget that the place is actually pretty small. You get to save your bottle here if you buy from them and (perhaps) if you are a member
4
Very nice small place 2 outlets across each other the food is ok decent but the fun is buying your bottle at a very reasonable price in singapore and they even keep the bottle for you if you dont finsih it sealedwould definitely come bac

Drinks and co is a great spot on club street but there are a few things you need to beat in mind about the place:Drinks by the bottle is really cheap the best you'll get anywhere in SingaporeThey have a decent stock and varietyYou have to buy your mixers separatelyIt's pretty small for the crowd they attractYou've got to book a table in advance of you want somewhere to stand/leave your drink etcCoz it's a small crowded place you need a tableBy 7.30 on a Friday its rammed, barely any space to moveThe atmosphere is great but it can be a bit too crowded and hot and the service naturally drops tho everyone is pleasant and helpfulI recommend it but it might not be something you can deal with often

Are you serious? We have ordered twice with the same lady who came with a wrong order. When the manager was trying to apologize and proposed us a free plate of cheese the lady said that it was not going to be served anymore! We also found an hair in the bread basket but that was the last drop...also expensive and with a very limited menu. Awful place!!

Went along one Thursday at the behest of a broker pal, Muz, who claims to be a bit of face here. Great selection of wine, beer and spirits which reminded me a little of oddbins with a bar - you simply pick the bottle you want and hey presto gets to your table. Quite a young crowd for Singapore (think salcombe at easter) with lots of wannabe recruitment consultant types sticking their nearly maxed credit card behind the bar in an effort to impress the ladies. Good vibe though and great addition to club street. If you are over 40 and want to have any sense of dignity avoid it but all in all a good plac

Easy going ambience and having an additional advantage of being placed on Club Street. This place gets swarmed by people in the evening hours and you can bump in to many of the known faces there. Some people hang out there to just bump in to people and crack deals !The collection of Wine & drinks is good but slightly costlier than other places 
4
Cheap drinks, diverse and loud crowd : mostly professionals, aged 25-45, working in nearby offices.
Wide range of drinks, cheaper than in mostly bars - wines, hard liquors etc.
Best time to visit - from 6PM onwards.
Friendly staff.
Some finger food available.
5
The preferred bar for many young professionals, local and expat alike, to start their evening, largely due to them selling what appears to be the cheapest booze in Singapore, at least in the central area. At the lower end of Club St., this area becomes rammed on most Fridays and Saturdays, as the road is closed from 6pm to around midnight.Grab a table if you're early enough, and enjoy bottle service in many cases for less than S$100 per bottle. Although too small for a kitchen, things were improved significantly last year when they took over the failing bar adjacent and created the Drinks & Co Kitchen, the sister bar, twice the size, from where they will send food across as ordered from the menu.If you're celebrating with booze and on a budget, you're going to struggle to do better than to start the nigh here

It was super nice to have drinks in this place - you can buy whole bottles of liquor and make your own cocktails, or jut buy bottled wine for reasonable prices. The pizzas they have was also one of the best that we have tried in Singapore. Highly recommended place

We went there after dinner. It was quite busy both inside and outside. Lots of choices for a bottle of Whisky, Gin, Vodka etc. We picked vodka to go with cranberry juice, tonic and soda. We had to paid at cashier and brought it by ourselves. I service was horrid here from the beginning to end of the night. 15 mins before midnight staffs kept telling you that "You have to move outside now!" with a high tone of voice and moody face. One of them asked us if we want order more mix before they close which we did for 1 set more. It never came! Place is nice ambiance, full of interesting crowd but let's down with none-service minds, Unhelpful and Unfriendly staff.

This was a random selection walking along Club Street looking for after dinner drinks and dessert. We were attracted to the decor first then then dessert and drinks menu. Atmosphere is casual, fuss-free and had a good vibe.The good thing was that we had no expectations and were pleasantly blown away by the friendly and excellent service - our server was warm, informative and had a lovely sense of humor without being intrusive. The open display of their wines is a nice visual touch - made our choice easier. The dark chocolate tart was especially memorable.This place warrants another visit - and this time for dinner and not just dessert
2
This place was very busy and a good vibe which has led to the people serving being very up themselves.Unless you are there for he night buying a bottle is not a great idea and what they have " reluctantly" by the glass has been in the fridge (red wine??) a long timeDavi

To drink here you will need to spend S$65+ on a bottle, but we figured with drinks being S$10+ usually that only worked out to be 3 drinks each so it's worth it.The service was a little lousy, but the bar itself is very cool and draws a decent crowd. Ann Siang Hill is a great area in general
4
A lot of gin and vodka choice which was superb. We even got plastic cups to be able to drink outside as...(here we come to the negative sides)it was super cramped inside and I had barely any space to move.Interior is fresh though, staff is nice and prices are good
4
We tried to get in here two nights ago (Friday night) but it was rammed, as was Club Street generally. We just walked in last night as the area was relatively quiet, but service was none too good for such a quiet time. There is a great selection of booze on offer, including my new favourite beer Tuatara, plus Stoke Gold lager

Singapore has always been a boozy town, after office hours or extended Thursday to Saturday weekend but the hefty price on alcohol can sometimes sour the party. And then you discover Drinks & co! Bottles are cheaper than at the supermarket... The staff is super nice but they do struggle to close your bill fast enough... so the queue in the small venue can be a bit daunting. We have the feeling they'll solve this soon as the place becomes more and more popular among expats and locals alike Come with friends, the larger the group the more fun you will have. Mind that most of the time to will be standing on the street that is temporarily closed to traffic so you can enjoy your drinking time. So pretend you are in Hong Kong order another bottle and mingle cause everyone is here on a Friday night.
