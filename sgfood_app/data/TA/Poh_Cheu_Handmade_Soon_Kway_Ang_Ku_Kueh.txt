It's firm yet soft. The filling is substantial. Nice balance of peanuts and sweetness. Just a perfect red "packet" to keep you smiling after having one. You must have more than 1 but more than 5 I will call you a legend :)

Housed within a coffee shop. Can get quite warm on a hot day.
Very good kuehs though I am not sure if it is worth the 30mins queue....

The mush is still very good and quality maintained, through the my years of eating, need to queue, but service very fast. Price wise reasonable, with this type of quality. Love the peanut and green beans filling. And the soon kueh.

The stall was located in the coffeeshop, and offered a variety of kuehs. The Ang Ku Kueh (S$1/ pc) were in a variety of flavours : Red Bean (orange), Green Tea (pale green), Salted Bean (grey), Durian (dark yellow), Peanut (red), Yam (purple), Mango (pale yellow), Black Sesame, Coconut (green), Green Bean (red). I personally like the yam version as it reminded one of the traditional yam paste dessert. The skin was chewy and did not turn hard even after left on the table for a whole day.Abacus (S$8.50)A traditional Hakka dish, with balls made of yam, stirred fried with mushrooms, garlic and shallots. The version here was great as one really can taste the yam in it.Not forgetting its Soon Kueh (S$1), Ku Cai Kueh (S$1), Bamboo Shoot Kueh (S$1.30) which came in slightly translucent coloured and chewy skin. The bamboo shoot version was quite a rare find and came stuffed with strips of bamboo shoots in it

This stall located at bukit merah lane 1 is famous for the kuehs they sell and is always having a queue. Service wise is so so only and cannot be compared with restaurant standard since they are located in a coffeeshop (kpt coffeeshop). Bought some soon kueh and ang ku kueh and the taste is above average compared to those selling at other places and the price is reasonable as well. Overall opinion - good

Quality of ang ku kueh - not recommended. Peanut in the ang ku kueh too hard and skin too thick. Bought twice within 2 to 3 weeks- inconsistent quality on thickness of skin of any ku kueh. Bought 10 ang ku kueh of various types and 16 soon kueh, rice kueh and vegetable kueh - some with thick skins.quality ok but expensive.Black sesame ang ku kueh - commercial type.of black sesame. White bean ang ku kueh - ok and skin thickSoon kueh - okVegetable kueh - okRice kueh - skin thickOverall service - below expectation and when feedback to them They were defensive and gave "it is link that, take it or leave it" kind of attitude.Verdict: no value for money for kueh and ang ku kueh NOT recommendable

-Bukit Merah Handmade Ang Ku Kueh located at Block 127 inside KPT coffee shop-We queue for 5 mins which was not too bad. I was told the queue is longer during the weekdays. -There are 10 different flavors of Ang Ku Kueh to choose from. -Each one costs $0.90.-I bought 5 different flavors and concluded the nicest one is Ang Ku Kueh with peanut filling.

There is always a queue at this stall, and you can see that it has quite a few employees manning this stall located in a coffee shop.The soon kueh ($0.90) is nice and the ang ku kueh ($0.90) is thin-skinned but well-filled with 10 different flavours to chose from. The rice cake ($1.10) is decent too. Overall, the soon kueh and ang ku kueh are above average but not fantastic.Don't expect any good service though. The lady in front of me asked for another plastic bag to split her ang ku kueh purchase, and her request was flatly turned down

A good friend of mine brought me to this place one afternoon. The best Soon Kueh I've ever had. This place also sell very delicious Ang Ku Kueh, my childhood favorite. I tried their sticky rice with salted fish which really good and delicious, very filling too. Must try if in Sg
