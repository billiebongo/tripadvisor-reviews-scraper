One of the Best roasted chicken in Singapore that i have tried. Meat is so tender and juicy. Service staff are attentive and help us with the menu. Spacious, good for big groups.

Tried their new mango and lime sauce with my favorite 1/4 chicken. I will request for drum/thigh part. It was as usual tender and juicy. For the sides, I always like their chargrilled veg. Their garlic bread was nice too.
Service was good too.

I really like the Peri Peri Sauce at Nandoâ€™s and in India they offer vegetarian choices was pleasantly surprised they have wraps and burgers catering to vegetarians . There are sides like potato wedges and sweet potato which I like too . I would recommend this as ambience is great and service staff very friendly . The Peri Peri sauces choice is awesome which makes every dish so tasty . So if you can take chilli spice go here the chicken off course for people who eat everything is great too .

Nando's chicken are simply amazing. They are juicy, tasty and fresh. Sauces varies from simple (not spicy) to the maximum level, and if it is not enough, the separate sauces will come to the rescue to make it more satisfying. I have been to different stores of Nando's all over Singapore and they taste almost similar. Only the service will make the difference and for the crew from Nex mall, there are times that they are slacking. I also have some experiences where i ordered "breast part" in particular but maybe 3 out of 10 occurrences, they will make a mistake. Plus, mediterranean rice always runs out already around 8pm plus.. which is quite frustrating.. This is already happened 5 out of 10 occurrences on us.. So make sure to come early

I've attempted twice before to try Nando's chicken since I often see this place at Nex Mall. But never pushed through with my plans. This time around, I made up my mind to proceed. And I didn't regret it at all. I loved this Portuguese chicken instantly. The taste is so flavorful, it must be from a dozen or so spices put together. It is also a healthier choice for chicken since it is either grilled or roasted. I chose the lemon and herb variety of a 1/4 sized chicken. And selected a medium level of chili sauce. Then, I took Mediterranean rice for my sides. Very good combination. Different flavors can be tasted with every bite. The chicken and the rice are not as oily as I expected. Truly good meal. I will definitely try other menu items next time.

I've been to 3 other Nandos restaurants in Singapore, plus branches in Manama, Bahrain and Arundel Mills, Maryland. There isn't one near me in Japan, so I was excited to see one in Serangoon, and took the train back from Chinatown just to try it. I left so disillusioned. Slow, inattentive waiters and tasteless food. We ended up sending the hummus back, it was so bad. Thank God they couldn't mess up the peri peri sauce, because everything else was not the standard I'd expect from a Nandos

I've been to other nando's outlets and its quite sad to say that the service standards here ruined our experience. Service was slow despite the very small crowd. Some of our orders were missed out and the wrong food was served. Waiting time for food was also ridiculous. (about 20 mins into the meal, our starters were not even served

Ate here just now. I have to call the waiter twice just to request for water. Same goes for the tart which took them 10 minute plus just to serve. When I follow-up, the waiter told me they are making it "hot". Service is even better in Bishan Junction 8 branch

I went to the restaurant in Nex branch for several times. Found their staff were quite friendly. Most of their supervisors are from Philippines. Guess they are service-oriented with their natural friendliness. The only thing is that they need to improve their pipe music is always very loud. Will be good if they can tune it softly a bit. We had half chicken and a quarter chicken with side orders of corn on the cob and grilled chicken. Dessert: rainbow cake.
