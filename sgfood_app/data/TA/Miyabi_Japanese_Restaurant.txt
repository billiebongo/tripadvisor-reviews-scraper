Miyabi Japanese Restaurant (Raffles Town Club) Located at 1 Plymouth Ave, Singapore. Huddled within Raffles Town Club, Miyabi offers authentic Japanese fine dining cuisines .Their food quality is commendable with prime, quality ingredients used. we ordered The Sashimi & Teppanyaki Set consists of 8-pcs thick and fresh sashimi slices , 3-pcs grilled giant scallops topped with teriyaki marinade and a piece of fried salmon skin, grilled salmon with miso marinade, bean sprouts, and teppanyaki beef cubes grilled to perfection. I especially enjoyed the succulent teppanyaki scallops that were oh-so-juicy-and-sweet! Service wise, the waiters/waitresses were friendly and attentive to our needs. Overall, it was a delectable dining experience that left us eagerly looking forward to our next visit. A perfect place to celebrate special occasions with your loved ones!

its a nice club and I think the best place inside Raffles Town Club for meals. The lunch sets are very reasonable but dinner can be a lot more expensive. They have a feel nice sets for sharing. Wouldn't come here if not invited by friends

Miyabi is one of Raffles Town Club's restaurants. It provides fresh sashimi, sushi and teppanyaki.Almost of their diners are Raffles Town Club members. The restaurant provides a fun way of dining experience as diners can see how the chef cook the teppanyaki.Ambience and the environment were cozy. It offered a homey Japanese styled restaurant which private functions can be provided too. Staffs were courteous and readily to attend to each of the diners. We ordered their fresh salmon, mackerel, tako scallop sashimi. It was so fresh and the sweetness of the salmon lingered. Miyabi also offered mouthwatering desserts.We ordered their chocolate soufflé with strawberry sorbet at the side. It was fantastic. The bitterness of the dark chocolate soufflé with the sweetness of the strawberry sorbet was exquisitely amazing. It was one of the most amazing desserts I have ever had.Miyabi Japanese Restaurant is a must try in Raffles Town Club (RTC). However, diners should have a friend who have an RTC membership card to dine here. Service is good, food is great with valuable prices

I have a somewhat limited/narrow enjoyment of Japanese fare but have recently been converted to teppanyaki style of cooking. Having now visited the Miyabi Japanese Restaurant (part of Raffles Town Club) on two occasions I can strongly recommend a teppanyaki dinner here...it comes with flair and fire. The food is of the best quality and the presentation is superb. The cook at your table makes the evening very special

A shout out to this lovely Japanese restaurant - friendly service and exquisite food. I had sashimi and unagi-don - my friend (who is not familiar with Japanese food at all) had the teppan set meal and declared that she "love loved loved" it! This is a club and non-members are not allowed to eat in the restaurants normally but they are open to the public when there is an event on (we came here for lunch before visiting the Christmas Fair .... highly recommended .... worth coming to the Fair to eat here
