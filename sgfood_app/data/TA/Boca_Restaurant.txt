Sautees Cod Fish with Shoestring fried potato never disappoint and is definitely a must-try dish. My sure to order food whenever I'm there
4
Food, wine, ambience and service....perfect!
The only flaw was the a/c too cold...our hot food became cold fast....
Very comfortable and good for a girlie dinner :)
5
This is my second time visiting BOCA and I am still loving their dishes! Be sure to order their clams pot, it will surprise you with its amazing flavours!
3
I was expecting more from it. The table outside are not very cosy. The service was awfully long even for a glass of wine. It is presented as a "Chef" restaurant but it does not reflect on the menu and the service.

Pleased to have found Boca, it brought back wonderful memories of the great Portuguese cuisine, a favorite part of our holiday to Lisbon last year.Enjoyed a nice clam dish, and an ok egg and salami dish, but the real winner was the cod - ours flaked with potato, onion, egg and served with bread (forgotten name! - and the superb octopus, which was a show stopper! Finish it all off with an egg tart and espresso. You’ll head home with a massive smile on your face!A little on the pricy side, so I give 4 not 5 stars, but it is excellent food and I highly recommend anyone looking for a find Portuguese holiday memory

Took the wife for date night, the owner Daniel was there to greet us when we arrived and seated us promptly with a beverage, overall staff and atmosphere is very welcoming and comfortable. We ordered several starters, Cold Cuts, Clams in white wine sauce, Bacalhau Fritters, Croquettes, the Octopus main (Polvo à lagareiro) and several Custard tarts for dessert. All were awesome and we couldnt get enough, had an awesome time and will definitely be back soo
4
We signed up for the set menu for the restaurant month and the food really was delicious and the service was lovely. Like many special deal we have done before we found the amount of food to be wanting and left a little bit hungry still. I also found it uncomfortably cold, but I imagine when it's very busy it wouldn't be so bad.

Bread porridge was excellent - amazing what old brown bread, a good seafood stock can taste like. The octopus which came recommended was unfortunately a dud - not adequately seasoned, and could have been roasted better so it had a bit more char. Generally characterless. Salt cod fritters were good for what they were. Unfortunately wasn’t able to order too much between two not-particularly-hungry people alas.

Have just had a most disappointing (non) dinner at this overpriced, overrated restaurant. I am not a “grizzler” by nature, I like to find the best in life’s experiences, however this needs a kick...We arrived and ordered the happy hour drinks, 4 beers and two small white wines. A total of $60 plus plus.. we ordered a cheese plate and mains, a small, it could be said miserly portion arrived, one hour later we were waiting for our mains, they never came, the order misplaced. We decided to leave and requested the bill. A bill for $145 sgd arrived, we argued the account and a second was produced for $115. No apologies for the no show dinner. A huge price for a couple of drinks and a tiny plate of cheese.DONT WASTE YOUR TIME and MONEY!

This restaurant is definitely at the top of my favourite places to dine in Singapore. Their location at the top of Club Street means it's centrally located and convenient. What makes this restaurant stand out however is the consistently high quality produce they use (the seafood is always so fresh and the meats are juicy and tender), great tasting and authentic food and incredible service.The clams, grilled octopus and egg tarts are out of this world. The sweet potato bread is good too.There are cheaper places to eat in Singapore, but like anything in life, you get what you pay for.The decor is simple, understated and fresh and gives it a relaxes feel.Special mention to Dinnesh (his knowledge of the food and wine is impressive), the good looking waiter (I think his name was Cuz) who gave us fantastic service and food recommendations and the Portuguese owner who knows how to make customers feel welcome. And not forgetting the Chef and kitchen team. Thank you

Dining at Boca for the second time.
Food is quite good. A bit pricey for the quantity they served for that price.
5
Nothing bad to say. Great moment here. The octopus is delicious.
I recommend this place if you come in couple or with your family
5
Cozy ambience and friendly service crews. Food is great too. Place is clean and nice designs and colour.
5
Great customer service! Food was super delicious, especially the blanched octopus and clam pot! Will recommend friends and visiting the place more often!
5
Tremendous food and service in an otherwise plain but very authentic place. Everything was great! Loved it!
5
Pretty authentic Portuguese food with friendly staff! Bit on the expensive side but still worth it overall
5
The octopus leg was tremendous, tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.
Boca also made me realise that I had never really have a proper portuguese egg tart before, their version is so much better!
3
We have been in Portugal many times and were looking forward to great food, as many of the reviews were so enthusiastic.We were seated in a undecorated corner of the restaurant, when you reach the first floor on your right, so the whole feel of the place did not seem great. Only later did we see that the front of the restaurant was actually nicely decorated and lit.Service was good and very friendly.The meal in itself was just okay. The octopus, pasteis de bacalau and chocolate mousse were good, the rest was not great.All in al it was very underwhelming.
5
One year ago we visited Portugal and stayed there for 10 days, so we were able to meet a little bit of the Portuguese cuisine and we fell in love with it! So in this visit to Boca Restaurant we knew what we wanted and what to expect, here are my comments about the food and the restaurant: The food is fantastic and very authentic! The Chef is from Portugal which says a lot (positive of course!) The staff is super friendly and the manager really knows how to treat their costumers. Nice variety on the menu. And last but not least the restaurant has a very nice atmosphere! Definitely I'll come back and I'll order again the "Seafood Rice", it's simply amazing and pretty close to the one I tried in Portugal!!!
4
The food was excellent, the octopus was the star of the night for us, we still can't stop talking about it. Service was pretty good, the young lady was very knowledgeable and professional. The young man was a little bit confused.The lightning on the second floor, ( where we dined) was way too harsh and bright however. It was like stepping into a mall. It needs to be toned down a touch and made warmer to create a nicer dining ambience. Our near-perfect experience at Boca was marred by a horrendous and obnoxious lady at the next table. Not sure if she is hard of hearing, but her grating voice can be heard all the way from Portugal, where she needs everyone to know where she is from. This is of course, not Boca's fault, but she did ruin the experience for all of us as she got louder and more obnoxious towards the end. We left with full tummies and damaged eardrums
5
The ambient of the restaurant is superb with some European style and you will feel relax dining there. Food is awesome and the service is good also. Highly recommended!
5
They have moved and the food continue tasty and wonderful. The starter "bolinho de bacalhau" is super delicious and quality of wine follow the tradition of portuguese classics. To return with family, friends, for business or even alone.
5
A very nice place between Chinatown and Singapore City Gallery. It was afternoon, we took only a drink. Nice team. We will come back for lunch or diner to taste Portuguese food.
4
It is not that easy to try Portuguese food, especially good one.
You enjoy it with their Rose wine and it cannot be more perfect.
Very exciting experience.
5
Food is very flavourful. Love the pork cheeks and stew rice.
Friendly staff. Attention to details. Will definitely visit again.
4
New restaurant finding it's feet. Starters were amazing (could have been some bread). Butter bean stew was excellent and filling. Octopus a little bland. Would return.
4
In one of the coolest streets in Singapore for bars and restaurants this is a great little restaurant with really nice staff. We didn't have a booking and the place was full but the manager arranged a table for us and had taken our order within 5 minutes. The food is traditional Portuguese and excellently cooked. We had the cod fritters and then the mixed grill for main. The meat was succulent and very tasty. Definitely try their red wine sangria, you won't be disappointed but beware it is pretty strong.
5
I've not been to Portugal but the cuisine seems true to its origin from the various conversations we had with the chef and the manager who are both Portuguese. The cod fritters are a must-have and the croquettes are uniquely meaty... We also love the seafood rice and the bacalao dish with onions, eggs and potatoes. The homely food just makes me include Portugal on my next-to-visit list! The Portuguese wines surprise us too - they are amazing. Not sure if you would like medium-bodied or full-bodied? Ask the friendly manager Daniel who lends this personal touch to the whole experience. We love going there and we will visit again and again!
4
It would be hard to find a warmer welcome or friendlier service anywhere in Singapore.The charming Dinesh is a compelling host with the whole team including the Portugese Chef all smiles. The food is good if bland which is often the case in Portugal itself. There are no salads and few vegetables but cod fritters and fish stew were exemplary although served on plates which were too small to contain the delicious sauce without covering the table. The ultra modern cutlery was not user friendly either. The wine list could be expanded and much better set out. I missed peri peri chicken but perhaps that is being nit picking.The staff are so eager to please and there is so much to like about this place.I feel some small tweaking would make this place the true winner it deserves to be
5
Excellent fine food - The pork cheeks with mashed potatoes and the rice duck were delicious - The octopus salad was very surprising, in a good way - The chocolate mousse was interesting, it was actually more like a creme We spent a great evening, the place looks great, cool music, service is amazing
5
I visited Boca last August and was eager to see it. Boca is located in a charming street mostly with 3-storey level historical buildings. Boca's ambience is cozy and provides a very personal experience. I really liked and recommend the octopus and codfish.
5
The best place in Singapore to eat proper food. Great environment. Love the fish dishes, bolo do caco and the lovely dessert. Don't get tricked by the fake portuguese egg tart in Asia, try this one!
5
It's my 3rd here as my bf is a Portuguese he always miss his own food. I really love their Bolo Caco and egg tart. Super delish. Will come back again for sure.
5
Excellent food and good wine to celebrate Valentine's Day. The house is comfortable and the staff are helpful. The chef was perfect on his options for this event. Will come back.
5
We came to Boca with no clue of what was Portuguese cuisine and we spent a wonderful evening!Everything we received was really tasty! Salted cod fish croquettes, octopus salad, pork meat balls, seafood rice, duck rice, pork cheek... and also our desserts, nothing bad to say!Chef Helio and his team are exceptional!Special Mention as well for the service staff.. so warm and charming!We really had an excellent experience and will definitely come back
5
Last December by chance we arrived at the door of "Boca"...unfortunately it was their day off but we promise to return the next day, captivated by the welcoming sympathy of the owners and manager.The food was delicious, the service was warmth and if the Chef promises to put leitao on the menu....we'll be at Boca, when in Singapure
5
I went to Boca for the first time and will definitely go back! The food was pretty authentic Portuguese and very tasty, the menu was large, the environment was nice and relaxed, and the staff was very friendly. The chef personally came to greet us, and our waiter Dinesh was very attentive. I'm happy that Singapore now has a Portuguese restaurant as it makes a great, and different addition. I would recommend going to Boca and trying as many dishes as possible
1
Boca falls short of providing honest Portuguese food. When things are hyped up, it could go terribly wrong. Seafood has to be really fresh too. A number of Portuguese patrons made a complaint one year because the restaurant promised 'rabanadas' at Christmas. But instead, really common desserts were served! Try telling Brits to have mango pudding instead of plum pudding at Christmas
5
We went to this restaurant for our anniversary dinner & it was totally worth it. The food was excellent, house wine was good & the craft beer was amazing. We had Cod Fritters, Clams in white wine broth, Octopus with spinach & baby potatoes, Pig Cheeks with potato puree, Baked Duck Rice, Chocolate Mousse, Creme Brulee & Portuguese Egg Tart. The octopus was huge & still so well cooked. Loved the cod fritters & pig cheeks too. Duck rice is interesting & different from what we usually eat. Creme Brulee is more like Portuguese flan, but yummy. Mousse was good. Egg tart is must have. As I wrote in the beginning the house red was quite good. But best for me was the dunkel craft beer. Service was A*. The person who served us took care of minute details, without being intrusive. Ambience & crockery was beautiful.Overall an excellent place for special occasions. If I have to nitpick, the only grouse would be that portion sizes are tad smaller for the price. Highly recommend this restaurant

Came in here recently with a friend to try the set lunch at $15++. On the day we visited this consisted of a paella type dish, a drink and a creme brûlée for desert. The paella was very tasty but a little too oily for my liking. The dessert was a creme brûlée, but was fairly dry (perhaps in the Portuguese style) rather than softer and creamier type I tend to prefer. Service was excellent and I suspect the a la carte menu here is well worth a try
5
Food was marvelous, first time i try portuguese and really like it. Service was warm and funny, not cold and rigid like some fine dining places. Really enjoyed and went back a few days later
5
Had lunch here today. They serve Portuguese cuisine which is very tasty. Had the set lunch (seafood rice) for SGD 15 (about USD10). Excellent service. have wifi. In Chinatown.
5
Excellent diner tonight. Great food , really tasty!! Great service ! Will come back. The Cod was gorgeous!! Thank you , I did not expect to eat so well and I was very impressed!! Congrats !
5
I am a Portuguese wine producer, went there for a wine diner with other wine lovers and gourmet enthusiast, the kind of public that know what is this about. We all left very happy with the menu we had. Very nice vibe too.
4
The cheese and jam were marvellous and it was as close as we could get to authentic Portuguese food. Recommend the octopus and bacalhau dishes. Price is on the steep side but we need restaurants like this to satisfy our Portuguese cuisine cravings once in a while
3
This restaurant has the potential to become a great place. Chef is committed and passionate about the food. Manager and senior waiter are doing a great job to establish the 'portugese experience. Food is simple and tasty. Don't overorder as a lot of the dishes are quite rich and with generous servings. Some work is needed to sort out the seating and AC and general 'ambience of the upstairs room

Boca was a fantastic find: a pleasant Portuguese place along Bukit Pasoh – and Singapore’s only Portuguese restaurant, as it turns out. Downstairs, the walls are adorned with andorinhas – the swirling swallows that are a Portuguese national icon. Upstairs, it’s all blue palm frond wallpaper and lights dangling off ropes that give the place a pleasantly maritime air – as befits a country of great seafarers.According to the menu, Portuguese food is ‘lusty and robust’. It certainly is muito maravilhoso on the palate: we had the polvo à lagareiro (octopus), followed by the arroz de marisco (seafood rice), washed down with a crisp vinho verde. (Three cheers for the all-Portuguese wine list, featuring some of the best grapes from the drizzly Douro to the sun-drenched Alentejo!)Dessert was a melt-in-your mouth pastel de nata which conjured up fond memories of holidays in Sintra. (If you think you know custard egg tarts from dim sum restaurants – think again: the real deal is a thousand times better!
3
Your 4.5 star rating should more accurately be 3.0. We went in the past and the food was good, which is why we returned. But this time the kitchen/service was slow and inconsistent, and the food uninspiring. We have been many times to Portugal and we love the food there but in our opinion BOCA does not represent the Portuguese gastronomic richness. Management needs to give more attention to details to make BOCA a special place
5
Fantastic!!! Genuine Portuguese food in Singapore!!! The best cuisine in the whole world!!! The Chef is a very talented young professional that really loves what he does!!! Really great staff! Very friendly and welcoming! Amazing place to have lunch or dinner!!! Everyone should try it. You will never want anything else...Portugueses, Aqui é o sítio para comer boa comida Portuguesa! Boa gente e excelente Chefe Português! A não perder e a repetir muitas vezes
5
This was my first time at Boca and in fact eating Portuguese cuisine. I'm Portuguese Eurasian... But come on, we all know Eurasian cuisine ain't Portuguese I read a few negative reviews of this place, mostly in 2015, and I'm glad to say NONE of the problems listed by those reviewers remain. The service was impeccable, the food was phenomenal. We sat at the pass, and the Chef regularly engaged us in conversation, and every time a dish came out that we didn't order, i was planning my next return trip. (N/B. The gamberi that was going out looked amazing... they're huge prawns, and I mean HUGE, not those pathetic small shrimp that you often get in Italian or Spanish tapas places. Definitely on my to get list on the next visit.)Manager recommended a wine for our meal and it was very very nice (can't remember what it was though, it was one of the house reds).My 3 TOP recommendations are the cod cakes and octopus leg. The sumptuous cod cakes that are to die for. It's tasty, soft coddy goodness surrounded by a light crisp outer shell of fried batter. Absolutely delicious. I could eat it just as a main. It's that good.The grilled octopus tentacle was divine. It wasn't chewy or hard, it was perfectly al dente, salty as Mediterranean grilled seafood should be, and a big portion to boot. Finish off the meal with the Portuguese egg tart. This ain't a suggestion Now I know what many of you are thinking - You've had some before at the Hawkers centre or Chinatown. No, those suck big time. I was basically orgasing when eating the Boca egg tarts. And I don't even like dessert/ sweet things in general.Don't forget to have the house wine, the bread basket, and for 2 people, 2 starters and 1 main is pushing it, so keep that in mind when ordering!This restaurant gets a loud Shiokadooooooos! from this reviewer
3
My first time on Portuguese food! I like it especially their seafood . They have reasonable good value for money white wine too ... I was there twice and seated downstair. High bar stood as the tables are only meant for 2 in level 1. Upstair is too dark and that night happened to have a big group ...so noisy for me liking. Good place to hang out w few friends!
5
This restaurant situated half way down Bukit Pasoh close to many Duxton area restaurants is a great find. The set lunches cost S$16 for a nutritious main course and a sweet. The menu changes every day. Friendly staff Easy to have a great lunch at low cost in well under an hour. The a la cartel food I have not tried yet. But I've seen it being cooked and served and it looks and smells wonderful. Love this olace!
5
I'm Portuguese and I usually don't eat at Portuguese restaurants when travelling.I've heard the Boca was good and I went there for dinner.The decorations is very nice and the restaurant has the right size.The food is authentic Portuguese and with a very good quality, very difficult to find outside Portugal.Besides they have a good wine list and excellent wines by the glass and a fair price, having a set inch menu for 15 SGD ++.An excellent choice in this fantastic city
5
I had a wonderful lunch at this restaurant that was recommended for a Portuguese girls living in Singapore. The atmosphere is very sophisticated, perfect ironed white clothe napkins and very kind staff. I ate a delicious Cod fish highly recommended!! as well as a little cake for dessert (I don`t remember the name).It is not a cheap restaurant but it is worthy if you wanna have a tasty and nice meal
5
What to say? Boca is one of my very favorite restaurant in town. Food is alwayg great, it never disappointed me. I love the atmosphere, inter, the chef is a cool and guy that will be happy to chat with you and tell the story behind any dish
3
Went there to celebrate husband's birthday and have already left a message with the restaurant when I booked the table. However, nothing was offered so that was pretty disappointing. Besides this, the little place is pretty cosy and we were the first customers there and we received a very warm welcome. They even offered toys to keep my toddler busy. Food was overall good. The clams in a pot were delicious. Chef recommendation pork cheek was slightly on the dry side. Lamb cutlets were quite yummy and portion was generous. They were able to recommend and create cocktails to suit our palates, but the prices were just too much. To sum it all, i think it was just overpriced. Our meal ended up costing us a good sgd250+ and we didnt't even get a small cake(or anything) with birthday candle like I wished/instructed.
4
This restaurant is run by a Portugese gentleman & has a Portugese chef. We were 2 of us & had 3 starters & one mains.The starters were all delicious, the bacalao with chickpeas was perfectly balanced. The chorizos (not really Portugese are they?) were very good but the dish of the day were the clams in white wine. Absolutely out of this world!The mains of grilled octopus with baby spinach was a bit disappointing, as the octopus lacked flavour (nobody in Singapore does Octopus as well as Blu Kuzina!
4
It was my and my friend's first time to try Portuguese cuisine. I love the ambiance, very cozy. We had a little corner by the window on the second level. The place was well decorated with wall decor of black swallows - which I read from their website are Portugal's national icon - Andorinha. Lovely setting!Staff are courteous and one is friendly and chatty however the service a bit slow. Some of the orders - we had to wait much longer. For starters, we ordered the octopus dish and it was well prepared. For mains, we ordered Cataplana de Marisco which we thought something like Paella. It was far from it but it still a good choice. We also love the Pork with clams and goes well with the special rice. The rice is really good! We had to order additional one!One friendly staff recommended the flan dessert however I was more impressed and prefer the Pasteis De Nata (Portuguese egg tart).The manager and the chef are both friendly and good sport. My friend requested for a photo opp with the chef and he was gracious and goodheartedly accommodated the request
5
I walked in and asked for a dish that would introduce me to traditional Portuguese cuisine and would fit in with my gluten free diet. I was treated to Bacalhau Ã  Braz which is a mix of bacaloa salted codfish, onions, egg, and some other ingredients, paired with a house Vinho Verde or Green Wine. It was a beautiful dish and felt like comfort food. I really enjoyed the slightly effervescent Vinho Verde. Each member of the staff was attentive and took time to speak with me. I especially enjoyed talking to chef Helio Goncalves
3
Can't really recommend this restaurant. I love Portuguese food and the chef is actually Portuguese, so I had high hopes. Alas, the bacalau was way too salty, I think it needed a few more rinses in fresh water and the porc Alentejana was just so-so. Shame really, as these are fundamental dishes for this cuisine. The tables for diners downstairs is in a narrow corridor adjacent to the kitchen and can get pretty smoky. The prices are pretty high.On the positive side, the drinks were well made, the bread delicious and the staff courteous
4
Celebrated my birthday here twice with different sets of friends. Love the food and the ambiance. Good selection of wine as well. :)
5
This may be the only authentic Portuguese restaurant in Singapore, however I have to say that it is the best Portuguese cuisine i've had.
5
With a warm and friendly team, boca makes a very welcome restraunt to dine in. The food is definitely worth the prices mixed with quality and quantity
5
Brilliant place with excellent dishes, lovely decor and a perfect host! Will certainly visit again soon.
4
There is so much choice restaurants-wise in Singapore that it took us awhile to return to Boca. We ordered the sweet potato bread, eggs with chorizo and the special of the day - duck rice. Everything tasted good, albeit a bit too salty for my palate. Ordered the olives because I remembered them to be good the last time (queen olives?) but was disappointed to be presented with run-of-the-mill Kalamata olives instead. Had a bottle of Portuguese red wine recommended by the staff - it was good and reasonably priced. Egg tarts are a must order - they are the best! Service was hit and miss
1
Really really dreadful - the worst restaurant experience we've had in Singapore. Cold food, sent back only to arrive back at our table cold again 20 mins later Very slow service - 1 hour for a bottle of wine to arrive. Massive differentiation in portion sizes around the table Really really terribly bad. Shocked.
1
I really don't write bad reviews unless I truly believe it was a bad experience. This was the worst restaurant I have been to in Singapore. If you're after tapas or something similar this place misses the mark by a mile. Although this is the only Portuguese place in Singapore - please do not waste your time, go to get something Spanish from FOC, Esquina, Sabio etc. We arrived and the restaurant lacked any atmosphere, no music, bizarrely they asked everyone to sit upstairs so it looks totally empty from the street. The interior however is quite cool, certainly the best bit about it. The service was bad an inattentive, if endearingly so. The food menu was unexciting and consisted of octopus, steak and clams in different guises. When the food came it was over salty, bland and generally drab. We ordered the chorizo which was two small sausages, tough, salty and priced at hefty $25. The clams, were better although it was only only shells and no clams. The steak for main course was pretty inedible served with cubes of pre-bought potatoes and inedible spinach. This is, however, accompanied by an expertly and lovingly fried egg on top. The wine list doesn't mention age, year etc. We asked for a normal red and were given a 15% bottle which we couldn't finish.Despite this, and this is the most annoying thing about it; the restaurant is so nearly quite good. I would say sort the wine out, ditch the exclusively Portuguese wine list - people would prefer to drink something drinkable rather than integral to the theme. The food needs an overhaul, Portuguese it maybe - but delicious it is not. Get someone to serve you in the first 10 mins and whenever you need them, rather than the first 30 and then fawning every two mins. Also if you are going to charge the prices you charge - please make it worth it. I had a similar sized meal in FOC for $240 which was incomparably good - especially considering this place was $260. Please try harder
4
Boca is tucked away neatly in a long line of restaurants along the street that houses it so it's easy to miss if you're not looking for it. The food is fabulous - the pork cheeks melted in my mouth and was the highlight of our meal along with some flaming chorizo appetiser. Must visit for a lovely Portugese meal
4
first think, don't abuse of the delicious Sangria otherwise the trip back from the first floor to main door can be dangerous, because the stairs are challenging :-) Other than that food is delicious and prepared by a real Portuguese chef, staff is adorable and make you very comfortable. With no doubt will visit again on my nest stop in Singapore
5
I would like to recommend this beautiful restaurant. A bit away from the main Street, we came accross the restaurant while having a walk around. The owner is really nice and very welcoming. The wine and Food are great, and it is good to have a change from Italian or any other European food now and then. Octopus salad and bacalhau were amazing.
5
It was a wonderful experience, not just a lunch. It lasted a nice long time, such a good flow to it all, and the food was different, amazing and memorable. Absolutely memorable.
4
We really enjoyed the food. It has a good variety of Portuguese food. The Bacalhau was delicious and the Polvinhos tambem.
5
We love everything about BOCA! The food, the ambience, the staff! We even had an event at our house to celebrate my husband's 50th and they were impeccables!!! Thank you guys! Muito obrigada!!!!
4
We were a group of 4 having mother's day dinner at this wonderful restaurant. The food was great, service was excellent. We were served by Dinesh, he was admittedly one of the best I've seen in the service industry.The restaurant is beautifully done up and has a very cozy vibe to it. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely go back for some more.
2
I was in Boca restaurant last year frequently. I had given it an outstanding rating as next to the good food the service was extra ordinary. The whole service staff changed this year and there is no more individual service and the unique character what made the restaurant special last year had also disappeared. It is now an average restaurant you can find anywhere in Singapore. My poor rating is due to the maintenance of the sanitary equipment. It declined and was a bit of an embarrassment towards my clients who have high expectations towards restaurant quality and service. Hope the restaurant will find its way back to the same quality and what made it special as it was last year
4
This is an authentic Portuguese restaurant with an original young chef from Portugal. We had the Chorizo, Bolinho de Bacalhau, Bacalhau a Braz and a nice steak with vegetables.It was nice there, not bad at all. Not really very good but definitely better than average.I will check it out more often in the future to see whether the quality standard varies over time
5
My last feasting on Portuguese food was a few years back in Macau. My fav 2 places are A Petisquiera and Miramar – you can never get enough food or wine when in those restaurants. I do recall 2 bouts of food coma because everything was good to the last bite.Since then, I’ve had to cook my own Portuguese but now here in Singapore I can happily go to Boca, on that cute little street in trendy Tanjong Pagar.Service with a smile, a real Portuguese chef, and lovely but cosy interiors, make for a winning combination.Now let’s get to the food. I have a fondness for establishments that bake their own bread, and only because I am a boulangere by training. Their Pão, azeitonas, azeite had great crusts and home made tastes, complemented by the clear & fruity flavor of Portugal’s pride, their olive oil, for dipping with a modest helping of azeitonas, the black olives.Up next was another winner, the Pastéis de bacalhau, cod fritters, was perfection in frying method, went down easy, tasty and moist. Washed down with my all time favorite from the Vinho Regional Alentejano, the Monte do Zambujeiro, an elegant red wine made of 40% Aragonez, 29% Tinta Caiada, 24% Trincadeira, 7% Alicante Bouschet. I was in Heaven.Flaming onto our table came the Chouriço em chamas - Chorizo flamed and grilled in vodka – chourico is pork sausage – I will pass judgement on to my friends who said it's the best since their last trip to Lisbon.I love shells and their Ameijoas à Bolhão Pato / Clams "Bolhão Pato"made with clams, garlic, coriander, white wine, extra virgin olive oil, that made a beeline straight to my heart. I had to ask for extra bread to mop up the broth that came from the copper pot – trust me, you’ll do the same. A well balanced blend of simple but great flavors.Sweets are my Waterloo and their Pastéis de nata, were definitely the authentic Portuguese egg tart, home goodness baked into every bite.Daniel, the restaurant manager, did his utmost best to ensure a good evening was had by the entire restaurant, not just my table - no mean feat where he has to run up and down stairs as the place has 2 floors for dining and one for private dining. The staff were pleasant and like the Portuguese, very polite.If you’ve never had Portuguese food, may I suggest that you let Boca take you on a flavorful journey to Portugal!NB - NO PHOTOS WERE TAKEN! TOO BUSY EATING!!

Well, this was my birthday dinner. I'm of Portuguese descent so I really loved seeing the menu...typical Portuguese food. The apps were fantastic, but cant say the same about the dinner and service. Food took ages to come out to the point one friend cancelled her order. Who dishes were way overly salted. Beautifully decorated though.
3
Go there if you want to try real Portuguese food in Singapore. The Chef, Daniel Alves, is extremely attentive and kind but unfortunately, waiters are definitely not up to expectations. It took us nearly 2h for 3 dishes and the place was half full. Moreover, if you consider that with a glass of wine per person you'll end up paying around sgd80 pp, there's a lot of room for improvement. If he manages to work on that, we will definitely come back

Dined here on a busy Friday night. That would perhaps explain why food took so long to arrive, even though we only ordered 2 appetisers and 2 mains and were seated at the bar! Really enjoyed the starters of cod fritters and baby octopus. Mains were very disappointing though and we sorely wished that we had given them a miss and stuck to ordering more appetisers. We had the pork with clams (average) and the Portuguese steak, which I only later realised was thoroughly misrepresented. They both looked exactly the same when they arrived – meat surrounded by a mound of overly salted diced potatoes and nothing that really stood out as being “Portuguese”. The spinach which came with the beef was so salty, I winced when I tasted it. The wine was pretty decent. Would like to give the restaurant a second chance, so would probably return again and sample more starters. But please, for the sake of everyone’s health and taste buds, go easy with the salt
5
Definitely will come back to take my family here. The clams garlic is so good, simple and cooked softly. The Bacalhau is very interesting and tasty. Coffee steak is so good. Egg tart and pear tart really makes us happy.

The cod fritters were awesome, as was the tartar sauce that accompanied it. The steak was of a high enough quality that it wasn't an issue, and it was cooked to my satisfaction. My wife ordered the steak well-done, which I tried to talk her out of doing. However, to my delight, it came to the table medium-rare. I prefer to believe that this was the work of a conscientious lover of steak at the grill, rather than incompetence. I've rated the food down only because it was too salty.Service was excellent, and the environment was clean and stylish.The value for money of this restaurant is not as advised by Tripadisor. It is categorized as a "cheap eat," but was far from cheap. Our two entrees, two mains, and a single glass of wine of house wine ($18) came in at $125 with the 10% service fee. This certainly does not reflect the $7 - $22 range specified on this site, whether that was meant to reflect overall meal cost or the cost of the entrees, both would be false. While this is not necessarily the fault of the Boca, it was a source of dissatisfaction for me. Be prepared to pay $45 for a main if you want to order from your gut with no budgeting discipline
5
The restaurant is in a very good location of Singapore, near many nice restaurants and bars. It is rather small though with a sitting area on the ground floor and on the first floor.The different plates we tried were very good, delicious and filling. Definitely recommend trying the garlic bread that is made in house - fantastic!!The wine was also very good during our dinner and the final glass of Portuguese fortified wine helped us finish the evening perfectly
5
We celebrated a birthday here - it was amazingly delicious! We had the flaming Chorizo, Cod fritters, and Clams for appetizers, and for entrees, the pork cheeks, octopus rice, and cod and potato dish. Everything was so flavorful. We had their Portugeuse red wine, which was really good, too. I'll definitely be back if I'm ever in Singapore again. Except this time, I think I would order more appetizers and eat tapas style because they were just THAT good!
5
We just had dinner here. Honestly the best food of our entire trip. The clam started, sirloin steak entree and egg tart dessert can't be beat! The restaurant is beautiful and clean. The staff is so friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back. Really a treat!
5
Being a portuguese that is away from Portugal for a while, we miss good portuguese food. Boca restaurant really exceeded my expectations.The food was amazing and great service too.Thank you Mr. Daniel Alves for everything:) For sure, ill go back again and will recommend the restaurant
5
Just saw an ad in a magazine of this restaurant on the plane.Came to the restaurant and had one of the best Portuguese meals I remember (I am Portuguese living in London). Amazing steak!!! Tender and full of flavour!The chef is very friendly as well as all the staff! Unfortunately I am leaving soon otherwise I would definitely be a regular..
5
Thanks to TripAdvisor it is every time possible to find interesting restaurants to visit. Boca wasn't hard choice when reading reviews - and besides it was near to my hotel! Lucky me.Negative things first. I didn't have reservation and was seated by the counter. It was interesting to follow these professionals working but sitting there was totally uncomfortable because there was no room for legs - at the same time all the tables stayed empty. They also didn't have enough staff that night and it was pity because place is awesome and these amazing guys just could't do more... Their attitude was however on top level which is great - hope they have enough strenght to go on! And these are just things I noticed, not big issues!Service, even they were too busy, was excellent. Manager and waitress had best possible attitude, they were happy, they knew what they are doing, they knew products they were selling... True professionals you just meet too rarely! Of course there were true professionals in the kitchen too - when you are working under guests eyes you need to have clean ways to work. They did!And finally the most important part: food and drinks. Once again, amazing! Interesting, authentic, fresh, full of flavor, beautifully plated... I enjoyed every single course from the starter, crab salad, till the very end, egg tart. So delicious. Wines worked well with the courses and waitress was able to give information about the wines too.The price? With this kind of quality it could be much, much more expensive
5
I just loved everything about this restaurant. The service was great, even it was a new staff who was getting trained, the food was very tasteful and well prepared, the wine selection is sufficient and the location is easy to get. What else do you want
5
The octopus appetizer melts in your mouth.Still don't know how the chef got the pork cheeks plated in one piece. They fell apart with the slightest touch of my fork and the flavors were wonderful.Don't miss the egg tart and sweet rice for dessert
5
Very good restaurant with real Portuguese food .the price is very good as well . Nice staff believe me people I'm from Portugal I know what I'm talking about.
3
We went to this with a friend who had been wanting to try this for a while. I had also read the reviews and they sounded promising and I have to say we were disappointed. We ordered a few dishes and shared them namely Chorizo and Octopus and Beef with a cream sauce. We had to wait a reasonably long time for the first dish to arrive...in fact had to ask about our order. The restaurant was pretty full so maybe we just were there at the wrong time. The best dish was the Chorizo. There was nothing that stood out that would make me go back
5
I've never had Portuguese food and I'm so pleased to say that my first experience in Singapore was such a treat! Service: I made a reservation via Chope and also received an email shortly from the restaurant confirming my reservation and preorder of two of their FAMOUS portuguese egg tarts. I had to make a few changes and they were very accommodating. When we arrived, we were welcomed by Indra, the restaurant manager. He's full of life and extremely friendly. The rest of the staffs were attentive and friendly as well. Food: Divine. Divine. Divine. The highlight of our meal has gotta be the shrimp porridge and coffee steak. The first was SO comforting and delightful with every mouth and the latter was hearty with every bite. I never knew portuguese food could be so flavorful and I'm very happy to get to enjoy this cuisine in my city. The egg tarts were lovely too! Please remember to preorder them because they only make 20 a day! We also ordered the cod fritters but we didn't think much of it. Overall: A+ experience and I'd recommend everyone to sit by the bar/open kitchen because you get to see them cook in action. We went there for my friend's birthday and the team was so sweet to surprise us with a special dessert which we both enjoyed. I'd recommend anyone to Boca for a comfort and amazing meal. It'd be great for a date or with couple of friends
5
Went there on Friday evening with friends, we had a great time. The place was nice, the food very delicious and the service excellent! The staff was very kind and caring. We tried 4 starters and 4 main dishes, all were perfect, I'll come back for sure to try the other items of the menu
4
Very impressive effort by a young and enthusiastic team, from the chef to the front office, to make sure we enjoyed ourselves. Not familiar with the Portuguese menu, we were happy to get recommendations, which were excellent. The biftek a café was succulent, the bacalhau a braz was a discovery. The Portuguese wine list was extensive and expensive. We splurged on a bottle of Ponte de Canas which proved to be an elixir. The staff even convinced us to has the sponge cake desert, which gave us no regrets
5
Was there with my partner last month. Food was all around delicious, would recommend the cod fritters and bacalhau porridge. Egg tarts were superb as well, eggy custard with a flaky crust, however i think a tad too expensive.Service was very attentive, our waitress came to check with us often to see that our needs were attended to.Overall, 2 thumbs up from me! Will be back soon
4
Went there for an anniversary dinner. Had the cured cod, chorizo, and sweet potato bread with garlic butter for starters, pork cheek and beef with almond rice for mains, and of course ending with the Portuguese tarts. Portuguese beer and wines were also good. Service was generous and attentive. Will definitely go back again
4
We visited BOCA first as a party of 6,two third being brazilians and our criteria reflect the reality in Singapore, a vibrat place with several very good restaurants where, nonetheless, service is mostly slow and por. At BOCA the first feeling was that of having the staff genuinely interested in serrving prapidly and in being warm and friendly to the clients.Food was good with special marks going to pork cheeks, cod fish "à Brás" and clams "à Bolhão Pato". May be we were gifted with perfect choices, but we enjoyed very much the dinner.The restaurant deserves a larger serving area and, perhaps, to extend the choice of fish/seafood. Shall go back
4
Received by super firendly staff, often coming to check if everyting was going fine. The Portuguese signature dishes are great, and you can always enjoy olive oil on the side if wanted, specially important in the cod fish meal. The deserts are delicious and a must try. The music is quite modern and bring to a portuguese and brazilian rithms that nicely pace your dinner. I would say is not cheap, but givens nice value for the high quality of food served. Including also tradicional portuguese Christmas deserts would give a plus to experience for people like us coming in this season. You say to ask for a fresh wine from Alvarinho grapes and finsh the meal with a Porto (don't ask it cold)
5
My partner and I toured Singapore for a week, eating out for every meal, and Boca was the highlight of our dining experience. The customer service was outstanding. Our waiter, Mike, had perfect knowledge of the cuisine and was able to make recommendations to our taste. He was friendly with a sense of humor and made us feel welcomed. The food and drink were delicious. Our dinner for two was $116 SGD, which isn't exactly cheap, but we felt the price was worth it for the quality of the food and service. We particularly enjoyed the Portuguese cappuccinos and the Salada Polvo (octopus salad). We have always found octopus to be chewy and bland, but Boca's dish was impressively tender and flavorful. Outdoor seating is available. We hope to visit Boca again next time we're in Singapore
4
I visited with a friend. We had an excellent and memorable meal. The food was just right. The white wine was very good, and the overall feel was good. One has to know where to go to find the restaurant.
5
I went here with my VIP guests and we enjoyed so much by authentic Portuguese foods in the modern and classic styled restaurant. Only one Portuguese restaurant in town and it is truly value for money!
5
It was one of those nights when my boyfriend and I wanted to try a new restaurant in Singapore. I found out about Boca Restaurant from a colleague of mine and decided to give a shot. Now, I am already planning to go back there again during this holiday season.The service is excellent. The waitress are knowledgable and attentive. They know what to recommend us and we are far then disappointed with their recommendation. Especially with the wine selection.Our favourite dish is the coffee steak and the Portuguese egg tart! It really feels like I'm in Portugal all over again!I would say this is one of the recommended restaurants in Singapore and the one and only Portuguese restaurant here
5
Was back from Lisbon and Porto a couple of months ago and am craving for some Portuguese food. Found Boca and went there to get my cravings fixed and i didnt regret going... E staffs r great! Explaining patiently e wines n e dishes so tt we can make up our mind. Food?? U got to eat it to experience it! All i can say is I am going back for more! Love e interior deco! Realy brings me back to Lisbon and Porto..

Visited for my husband's birthday and the restaurant made sure we were well taken care of. Service staff Benedict was very attentive and well-versed with the menu, giving us a quick rundown on the specialities. We really liked the ambience and the varied food selection of seafood and red meats. Special thanks to the restaurant for arranging a surprise chocolate moose for my husband as it was his birthday - he was pleasantly surprised by the gesture. Ended the meal with a shot each which was very welcoming for a rainy and cold evening.Definitely will be back for the Sweet Potato Bread, Coffee Steak and egg tarts! â˜º
4
I made a reservation but there was a technical error. I ended up arrive to a full restaurant without my reservation. Indra, F&B manager was trying to find a solution for us in a very attentive gesture. He finally converted a table for two into three for our party, making impossible to possible. We enjoyed atmosphere, nice lighting, decor and ambiance. Good selection of menu; sweet potato bread, gambas, cod fritter, slow cook pork cheek, Portuguese pork and flamed chorizo. All very tasty and we really enjoyed it. Hospitality by Indra was thorough till the end and to ensure we left the restaurant satisfied.
2
So we heard amazing things about this restaurant and because my boyfriend is Portuguese so we decided to come here as we haven't had Portuguese food since we last visited Lisbon in May. And boy weren't we disappointed!My friends, also Portuguese with my boyfriend all 4 of us dined here for dinner. First of all it was PRICY. There're no decent (and I emphasise decent) bottle of wine that's cheaper than $100. The food was in really small portion and expensive. There's nothing in their dishes represents Portugal as it was not hearty and in big portion and definitely not something you could rave about. It's kinda like walking into an American diner and being fed tapas size ribs.My friend and my bf was so unimpressed that they gave feedback to the waiters right away and also very disappointed to find out the chef were Portuguese and felt that they did nothing to represent Portugal.Needless to say we will not dine there again or recommend anyone to go
5
My wife and I recently had our favorite meal of our trip to Singapore at Boca. This restaurant is on a side street off the beaten path, but not to be missed. The food was authentic Portuguese and very fresh. We ordered the cod fritters, which were delightfully fluffy, the octopus salad which was seasoned perfectly, and the 12-hour pork cheek which was one of the most tender and flavorful pieces of pork I've ever had. Above and beyond the food was the outstanding level of service that we received, as several waiters spent a great deal of time explaining dishes to us and conversing with us about our trip. We were offered generous tastings of wine and digestifs as the staff truly went the extra mile, especially our primary waiter, Ben. We can't wait to visit again some day and tell all our friends. Do not miss a romantic meal here on your trip
5
This is by far the best portuguese restaurant outside portugal that i ve ever tried! And i know what i am talking about bc i am portuguese! Authentic traditional dishes, excellent portuguese wine selection, beautiful deco, and amazing service, and reasonably priced - rare combination in Singapore! Make sure to try the crab starter, bacalhau a braz, and pastel de nata and arroz doce for dessert.Such a delight to have a bit of home here in singapore! Looking forward for a 'fado' night (wednesdays) and portuguese wine tasting (mondays)! Will definitly introduce this gem to friends in singapore!

I celebrated my birthday at BOCA with my friends and I must say that the service was impeccable and food was delicious. Thanks Indra and Kat for making my birthday special. I'd highly recommend the cod-fish and smoking chorizo. The restaurant has a really nice ambience and is a perfect place for dates, gatherings and celebrations. I like it that Kat was addressing me by name. Impressed by the personalized service. The Portuguese egg tart was tasty too but you have to reserve it in advance. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good restaurant to wine and dine at
5
Great place to chill. The staff are friendly. They can make food and drinks off the menu.
Definitely worth a visit. I have been there many times as I truly enjoy the company of the staff.
5
Good food and wine from Portugal. The staff is very friendly and provide good service. The environment is cosy enough. Will definitely go again. Highly recommended
5
The service is simply amazing, very attentive and flawless.
The food is very well prepared although the portions are small.
Good Portuguese wine selection with decent prices.
Only sad part is that there's never enough egg tarts for all. =/
5
The moment you enter the restaurant you feel welcome and at home.
The staff and management is warm and friendly like they know you well.
Service is excellent.
Very attentive and polite service staff
5
Chanced upon this restaurant while browsing tripadvisor and what a gem it turned out to be! The food, Service, decor, ambience, wine, cocktails - all par excellence.Indra and Cat made our experience special by offering great recommendations on food and drink. The table next to ours had a lovely portugese couple who are frequent visitors at Baco and were very kind to share some ideas on "must try" dishes. We tried Cod fritters, Chorizo, Steak with Coffee Cognac sauce, Pork neck, Egg tarts, chocolate mousse. Overall, the experience was fantastic and it felt like we had made a gastronomical journey to Portugal
5
I've been travelling around and went to many portuguese restaurant. Usually they are nice but not quite like in Portugal. Suddenly I arrive in Singapore and I find this wonderful restaurant!!!! it's the real thing... If you leave in Asia and more specifically in China try the octopus "lagareiro" it's delicious.On top of all the nice menu you also have a good wine list with ONLY portuguese wines
5
We chanced upon this quiet restaurant with turned out to be a gem. A very creative menu of meat and starters coupled with a decent list of cocktails made the restaurant very different. Service of Indra and Cat along with their recommendations really made the evening for my family very special. The Steak in a coffee sauce was to die for and so was the pork dish. We will definitely go back to try out the rest of the dishes
4
Entered and the multiple cheery greetings started. The wine list didn't impress and we settled for Portuguese beer. Ordered 2 starters to share - cod balls and chorico . The latter was overpriced at $25 for 2 small sausages The mains were very expensive too. My 3 small cod cakes was $32They highly recommend the egg tarts . And again, not cheap at $6 for a tiny one. Taste like the $1 Macau ones to m
5
It was my first time to try Portuguese cuisine and I was very impressed!!! Beautiful food, amazing service, great variety. My absolute personal favorites were the pork cheeks and egg tart (actually the one disappointing thing was that they ran out of it and didn't have any other deserts. But looks like it's changed now). And the barman was so skilled! Good job guys, will definitely come again
5
As my boss arrived from the head office in Europe was looking for a unique restaurant what is serving good food with a good ambiance. We are a multinational team consistent of Indians, Malays, Filipinos, Chinese and Europeans (North - Central Europe). The food,service and wine recommendations were amazing and everyone was blown away by the quality of the dishes. Highly recommended for people who look for this something extra in a restaurant what makes the visit memorable
4
Food portions are bit small but great place for a drink. Bartender, Mani is very experienced and knowledgeable. He can conjour up drinks not in the menu.
5
fantastic meal book through Weeloy.com. We won a free appetizer!
great atmosphere, food and an amazing singer.
5
Absolutely Portuguese cuisine with home cook flavors. Attentive hospitality, beautiful and soulful Faro singer and songs.
5
This is a really nice Portuguese restaurant and I went there with my Portuguese friend who recommended it. The food is delicious and the stuff just could not be friendlier. I would definitely recommend it. Looking forward to go back
5
Must try bacalhau dishes:
1) Octopus salad
2) Cod fritters
3) Bacalhau 'porridge' - bread-based casserole. Real comfort food!
5
Ate at Boca last night to check it out as a possible spot for a birthday party. The food was fantastic, the service was excellent. Indra was very helpful and made it very easy for us to choose to hold the party there. We are looking forward to a great evening this December
5
Don't get to see many outlets providing Portuguese cuisine in Singapore; so it was a pleasure to visit this eatery. I liked the dÃ©cor on the ground floor with that a row of wooden serving boards hanging on the wall behind the long counter. The staff were pleasant, attentive and friendly. The seafood dishes were great and reminded me of the time I spent in Portugal. The evening got all the better with the presence of a Fado singer who stole the evening
5
I gone with my boyfriend to introduce my cousine and culture. I'm Portuguese and the music, friendly staff, excellent tasty food give me the same pleasure when I'm in Portugal. For us it's our favorite restaurant in Singapore. It was really amazing experience and I will advise to everyone this restaurant. The best service and food ever since 2 years in Singapore
5
Booked my birthday dinner at Boca for 24 people on the 10th October.All preparations done with Indra and Chefs Xico and Helio will help with any special requests ....Food was totally awesome and very authentic (being half PortiguesnI know a thing or two) and served across the tables at the same time. I had pre-selected five different a wines for the evening .... Finished the dinner at well past one in the morning .... Super friendly staff and Indra is doing a great job managing the front of the house whilst the two Fab chefs are ripping it up in the kitchen .... Hats off to the staff waiting the table too ...
5
Went with friends from overseas. Staff made us feel welcome the moment we walked in and had personalised service.Restaurant is in a good location in town within the trendy area. The restaurant was cosy quiet and a good place to catch up with my friends.Had the Shrimp Bread Porridge , Braz codfish and Pork with Clams.The best thing about the food was each main course was very decent sized. This was perfect as some western restraints have a tough time to dealing with small portions.I'm not a food expert nor have i had many other Portuguese food to compare with but this was pretty good and i will be back for sure
5
From the food, ambience to the live music, it's very original. A lot of attention paid to cater to your preferences. Amazing egg tarts.
5
It's my first time having a Portuguese dinner and I must say its beyond expectation. Their service staffs are knowledgable and absolutely friendly to everyone, it felt very cosy and the ambience just makes me feel like it's home. Highly recommended!!!
5
I have been to Boca twice and each time I always left being surprised. The food is amazing, my personal favourite is the bread porridge. I thought porridge was only for the sick, then for this, I don't mind to be sick often. Everything is thoughtfully chosen from the wine list to the amazing cutleries by Cutipol. The staff members don't just serve you food but they actually do remember you and make sure you're well taken care of. Thank you for the good time Team Boca. Looking forward to my next visit
3
I have been looking forward to visiting Boca for some time. It's in a great location on Bukit Pasoh road and has a great look and feel to the place, unfortunately for me that's where it ends.To start with the good points:Great decor and comfortable seatingNice atmosphere, appropriate volume music and seating along the bar to watch the chef workDaniel front of house was very polite and friendly (actually they all were - Daniel stood out)The clams I had for starter tasted lovely and fresh - this was the only pleasant aspect of our food The bad points:Server did not offer the chance to taste the wine. It was being served by the glass (Vallado - was pretty good actually) I would still expect the opportunity to taste.My wife ordered the Portuguese steak which was meant to come with caramelised onion, kalamata olives but instead came with just a tiny piece of spinach. The staff made no mention of this when the dish was presented, so lets just assume they run out of ingredients and failed to tell us. Also, my wife being pregnant asked for the steak medium to well and it came medium. We also saw another steak get taken back to the kitchen for being too bloody.No pork cheek left to order. We were told there was no pork cheek left for the evening but we were one of the first people to be seated for dinner (7:30pm). Lets assume they had run out or failed to prepare the pork cheek for mid-week.I felt there was too many front of house staff trying too hard. We kept having to introduce ourselves to 4 different front of house staff and answer the same questions each time. Daniel greeted us upon entry and I would have preferred he dealt with us the entire time, it seemed everyone wanted to have their 2 cents with the customers. The restaurant felt like it had been open 4 weeks not since the start of January. The staff were super friendly but there was an underlying vibe of uncertainty.Would I return? Probably not, which is a shame because the setting and restaurant itself looks great
5
The first thing that got my attention was the amazing service of the waiters and waitresses the moment me and my partner stepped through the door! They greeted us with bright smiles and served us cold drinks before leading us to our seats.The design of the restaurant set a cozy ambiance which really enhanced our dining experience! If i'm not wrong, the interior was designed by a Portuguese Designer.Having tasted Portuguese cuisine in Singapore for the first time, I'd say that the Portuguese have been doing it right with their cooking. The food, is simple yet delectable. Each dish has its own unique savouriness to it. I highly recommend the "Açorda de Camarão" or bread stew with shrimps. My mouth waters as I type.The food is great. The ambience is great. The wine is great. The service is great. What more can I say
5
I was really impressed by the attention to detail and balance. The menu was so appealing that I felt like trying pretty much every single dish. And what we did order was wonderful: the Codfish fritters (Pastéis de Bacalhau) were perfect and so was the Choriço in Flames and the Octopus Salad! We also loved the Bacalhau à Luca and the Pork Cheeks. But the real big surprise was the Coffee Steak - a definite must-try!And the other unexpected discovery was the rice pudding delight! I'm not at all a lover of rice-pudding but this one was put together and tasted divine! The only thing we regretted in the end was not having ordered the Beef Cataplana! Well, there will be a next time very soon! Thank you BOCA for not only bringing Portuguese food to Singapore but for doing it in such a delightful way! Mmmmm..
4
It was our first time visiting the restaurant.Food was very good, service staff were friendly, informative and attentive. To add, the personalised service made us feel like we were visiting an old friend's home! We also appreciated the many delicious food items that were served to us on the house. All in all, a lovely dining experience. I'd come here again for a special occasion
5
From the moment we arrived we were kindly greeted and served quickly by the friendly staff. We had not made a reservation and were lucky to get a seat by the bar as the restaurant filled up quickly! We ordered the bolinho de bacalhau (cod fritters) to start, followed by the coffee steak. Both dishes were really fantastic and perfectly managed to bring the taste of portugal to singapore! Unfortunately because we didn't make a reservation we missed out on trying their pastel de nata. This is a speciality of theirs and we were advised to pre reserve a couple of potions when making our next booking! We will definitely be going back to try these soon and would thoroughly recommend the restaurant to others
5
Never have I experienced such great customer service from the moment I called to book a table until the moment we left the restaurant. Great and authentic food that made us re-live great memories of home. Friendly and attentive staff, comfortable and modern decor. We can't wait to go back and try the rest of their dishes. Welcome to Portugal indeed at Boca
5
WOW, I love this place. To be honest, I have never had Portuguese food before. Then we spotted this little hidden gem near Chinatown and decided to try. Very beautiful three-storey shophouse, stylish breezy design and friendly & warm service. Our food was super delicious, fresh and resonably priced. I was impressed by Boca's wine list, most of them are imported from Portugal. Once you finish your dinner, please go to the first floor, relaxed bar where you can have some unique cocktails done by in-house mixologist. Yummy. Can't wait to go back
5
Delicious food and wines. I didn't know that Portuguese cuisine can be this good. Excellent service team that added to the wonderful experience. Not to forget the very talented barman who created our cocktails right before us. Thumbs up for team BOCA!
5
Great food, great ambience and great vibe. The range of Portugal wines selection is extensive. Will definitely visit again!
5
The staff were super friendly. Special thanks to Mike, Indra, Daniel & Nurul. Staff recognises me by name. The atmosphere is perfect. The food were served fast and efficient. Very detailed. Food tasted delicious. No complaints at all. Great for family, couple or even business.
5
Great place to enjoy the authentic Portuguese cuisine with fantastic Portugal wine , the service team was great and the live traditional Fado music performed by the musician Elisa Garcia was perfect .
Will be back and bring more friends to try BOCA !
4
I liked the atmosphere and the wine quality. The service and the vibe was great...The menu is simple but we spent 4 hours enjoying the food-so it can not be bad. I would encourage if you are staying close-by but not so sure to come by if you are only in Singapore for few days, as you can experience a great deal of Asian food.
4
The food was good and its great that we expose the magnifient food delicacies' we have in Portugal. The Portuguese wine (a excellent red Syrah - Peceguina Malhadinha) was a true nectar and the service was excellent with Kathleen doing a superb job. In other words we are definitely coming back (For the record both me and my wife love to cook
5
A number of positives about this restaurant- 1. Service is excellent- perhaps a bit over attentive but very friendly and informative 2. Food - I had the prawns in garlic sauce as a starter - 6 large succulent prawns and a lovely sauce incl some bread to mop up. My first main choice was the pork cheek which was out of stock so I had the Portuguese steak which was moorish again with a fantasic sauce. 3. Drinks - had a great Portuguese beer and couple of cocktails and a complimentary shot at the end - all excellent. 4. Atmosphere was quiet and warm
3
Made a reservation here for a Saturday night which proved smart due to a fairly busy establishment. Nonetheless, the food was nothing special, the drinks average, their ability to provide advise on the wine was on pair with a run of the mill place and service so and so. I short: an average place.
5
We visited Boca with another couple and a friend August 2015. Our server Kat was very hospitable and very knowledgeable about the Portuguese dishes offered at Boca. We shared several starters. The Octopus salad (octopus really is fork-tender), flaming chorizo and cod fritters were very nice. Several of us ordered their coffee steak and each came out cook exactly as we requested and was delicious. Our server Kat recommended we have the vegetable "braz" with our main course and it was also different and delicious. The service was excellent. I repeat, service was excellent in spite of a there being a large group present that night and one chef having taken ill. The staff informed us of the possibility of a delay early on and did an outstanding job of keeping us appraised of our order. Chef Francisco and kitchen staff did an admirable job and each dish came to us hot and was delicious. Kudos to handling what would have been a NIGHTMARE in a lesser business so well from Kat, to the on site manager and chef Francisco and staff. We will return and bring more friends. Please try this establishment

Since my last visit and giving Boca a rave review some things have definitely changed here.I took a friend here as they had been badgering me since my previous review to go.Well , the wine selection process took on Faulty Toweresque proportions. They were out of a number of listed wines, the "sommelier" wasn't the sommelier from previous visits and was trying to pass off house wine as "really good". We settled on a bottle and 15 minutes or more later we were told it wasn't available. Ditto on subsequent requests.The food was really good again however some of the little touches like the vodka sauce under the chorizo wasn't carried out the same way as our first visit.The general atmosphere in the place seemed forced, not relaxed as previously experienced.In a tough market, I would think these guys need to do some soul searching

The first thing you notice are the staff. The greet you by name throughout the evening. Very knowledgable waitress and a very informative Sommelier. Then the food arrived - outstanding. Listen to the waitress and follow the advice. Best Octopus ever.

Boca is definitely the place to hang out on a Friday night! Amazing authentic Portuguese food! If you re Portuguese and looking for a taste from home, Boca will fulfill your desire! If not Portuguese, a really different and tasty dishes to try! Loved it!

Service was good - waiters were nice and talkative. Food wise it has been disappointing: 30% of the things on the menu were out of stock, including the cod fish! Few appetizers were just ok and not good enough to justify the price you pay.Frankly my view is the place is too expensive for what you ge

had an event for my departmental staff and chose this portuguese restaurant from the usual chinese, italian or japanese food.The menu was prepared by the chef. Starters including sliced octopus and chorico (salty but goes well with olives or bread) and clams in white sauce were really good. The mains included Bacalhau a Braz (cod) and Iberico Pork Cubes with Clams which was too salty for my taste. Dessert included chocoltae mousse (good) and portuguese egg tart (too sweet)

My wife found this place. What a lovely experience. Phoned on the off chance,and was pleased to get the ok,for a Saturday night. Weather was dreadful,so probably played into our hands. Beautiful design. Great food and service. Genuine Portugese cuisine and a 20 year old Port,complimentary,to finish. Lovel

This was my second time at the restaurant in one month. I had such an incredible experience the first time and was completely stunned by the terrible service and subpar food the second time around. With the exception of the sommelier, the staff were incompetent and clueless. Our waitress somehow managed to send the piping hot quail confit we ordred flying across our table, smashing plates and glasses everywhere. Despite spilling a full glass of wine, the staff didn't offer to top it up when we finished our bottle. We ordered a medium coffee steak, which came out almost entirely raw. Then we were told that the head chef was away that day and whoever's in the kitchen was new which really wasn't much of an excuse. While the staff were apologetic, the entire experience left us feeling very disappointed needless to say we wont' be returning until the lack of consistency in service standards and food quality are resolved

This was the second time we have been - the food is great and we wanted to give it one more chance... but I walked out disappointed and honestly irritated at the shocking service. Which is a shame, because walking in, it is quite impressive. The ambience and decor is really different, fresh and contemporary and still stylish and edgy. The menu looked good, the wine was great. But we had to physically get up and serve ourselves wine 4 times, look for a waitress to refill water glasses. No one removed our plates when we had finished eating until the next course, which takes a while also. Two tables had finished eating around us and their entire table wasn't cleared the whole time we were seated so we were surrounded by dirty dishes. In fact when we asked to have our mains cleared after finishing, the waitress took only half the plates and resumed her standing position by the stairs until we got up and handed her the rest of the plates. No one refilled our wine glasses before each course, and they take the bottle away - which was annoying with such bad service - making you constantly aware of the poor attentiveness. But the food is great. It's not cheap, but it's worth it. I just can't go back again. I went twice within two months after they opened. So, maybe wait another 6 months before you go and hopefully something will have improved

I had dinner twice at boca. Food was always outstanding. First time service was a bit slow but I guess this was because they had just opened. Anyway I went there last weekend and the service was now very good and friendly staff. Well done
