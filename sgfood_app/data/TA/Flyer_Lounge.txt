Flyer Lounge located on the third floor of Singapore Flyer. It has an open observation deck from where the view is fabulous. Good for cocktails but is expensive. There are many other food options at the ground floor food court

Very relaxing place to have drinks after dinner and also enjoy the beautiful skyline. Prices are very affordable.

The experience of eating food while having the mesmerizing city night view is an experience in itself. The food is good. The service is fine.

Fantastic environment for getting ready and relaxing for a long flight to Aucklandas my wife and self had twelve hours for this activity

On your way to the flyer and out of it you will see many many things which will not only entertain you, but will also educate you!

The service was really good, but things are pretty pricey. It's a nice way to pass the time until it's time for the big ride.

Th food was not up to the expectations according to the price. But, its a money for experience and view. You can have food before or after ride on Singapore flyer which is a wonderful ride and amazing experience.

Visited this place but did not tried anything due to time issues.....expect to enjoy next time here. Little costly, but expect to be good fun....

far from the center (20 minute walk), but worth, specially at night, avoid high season with long queues

After a good ride on the Singapore Flyer, you will enjoy a inexpensive drink of your choice and sip it slowly as you watch the tranquil and peaceful harbour to your great delight.The lounge has little snacks you can order too.Great place to end your experience at the Flyer

Good customer service, staff are friendly, price is expensive but i like the outdoor seat. Nice view at outdoor during the night. Very cool and comfortable. Not hot to seat outside, peace, quiet and relaxing.
Recommend to come there to chill.

It is like a qantas club, nice chairs, good views and food if you order early. It was a nice place to sit out of the heat and humidity while we waited for the wheel.
The service as excellent

Yes it is a nice relief from the crowds, nice views. But unless you have no concern about money, I wouldn't recommend wasting it there. I did not eat there.

The lounge is a great precursor to the Flyer experience. The lounge is well appointed, drinks available from the bar and most importantly clean toilets for you before boarding the flyer capsule.Staff are helpful and attentive and they run a well timed well oiled operation. Slick and entertaining

DO NOT do the dining experience. Worst dinner of my life it was like plane food but worse. I would expect to pay $10 for that food not over $200 for two people. Very disappointing. The staff were also really unprofessional not something you would expect when you're paying this kind of money

This is like in London, on top of this flyer you are able to see the whole city of Singapore in every angle. For the length og stay inside of it is just right. Ou are able to take lots of photos. I heard from the locals that they might close it because the owner is not earning much out otit

We chose to have dinner on the flyer. This was an amazing experience. When we first arrived we did not think it would happen as there was a thunderstorm. We were given free drinks whilst waiting on the weather to clear.Once on board we felt as though all our needs were catered for. the food was good and the views were amazing, A wonderful experience at night as you can see all the buildings lit up.I would thoroughly recommend this experience

Great city skyline view day n night. Food fare was okay and edible which is the usual case throughout the world. I always have this explination why the quality of the food goes down when there is a splendid setting to the restaurant: the chef and his cooking hands are busy admiring the view while the restaurant owner is very confident that guests will still come to patronise to savour the view, the food is of secondary importance
