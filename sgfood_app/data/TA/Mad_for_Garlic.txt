The service at the restaurant was good. My friends and I also enjoy the food there too. I will recommend it to my friends and family too.
1
Food took an hour to come.The spaghetti was so so bland,i couldnt finish it as it was just too bland.Not worth the price
3
Generous dose of garlic to make every dish a delight! Spacious, ideal for families and friends. I like the peaceful ambiance of the place. Would return again with my family,
2
The food is so bland, not sure why this place has received good reviews.The garlic bread was fine, the pizza we had was nothing special (although we did like the thin crust) the chicken risotto looked great but was very bland and the crab/ lobster pasta was terrible.The service was ok but we were very disappointed with the food. We had high hopes, love garlic and tasty food
4
Not sure if I liked the idea of having kpop music in the restaurant. Food wise was good - we had the shrimp pasta, crab pasta, and garlic bread etc. Service was great! The waitress and waiter were helpful and fun. The place was rather empty during dinner time. Overall it’s worth it!
4
The restaurant is located on 2nd floor at one corner. Look out for Starbucks and you should be able to find it.Of the 5 dishes which we ordered, the garlic bread and fried rice are the ones which really stands out, esp. the garlic rice. Simply delicious even though i'm not really a garlic fan
2
We have been going to Mas for Garlic regularly but not recent months.In Aug, we went to visit again, to our surprise, the food qualify is not as good as before, except the garlic bread. The chicken and mushroom risotto doesn't taste as nice, and the beef tastes strange for the beef and salsa rice on a grill.And they started to charge for warm/cold water, AND there is NO refill. We find this is a bit over. Will unlikely be coming back in future

I couldn't think of a better title! After three years, I returned to Singapore's Clark Quay to find my two favorite restaurants were gone! Mad for Garlic and Fern and Kiwi. We knew the had a location in the mall so we jumped on a train! Don't let the sound of mall dining discourage you! If you love garlic, imagine adding heavy cream sauces, butter, bacon and the right about of spice and heat. That's mad about garlic! I ALWAYS get the garlic tower. Imagine a tower of bread with tons of garlic and soft bread inside... its more that I can begin to describe with words! This place will knock your socks off! Sizzling rice is amazing, as is the thin crust pizza and erdinger beer
5
Had heard & read about the place.. headed to the place.. Decorated with Garlic& more garlic.. Make believe Garlic pods..We ( Besties & me had a super time..We had amazing Garlic Snowing Pizza..Grilled Chicken & Mushroom Risotto..along with Garlic Bread Tower.. with our white ..Highly recommended.
5
I almost walked past this place - but the name intrigued me and well yeah, I guess I'm mad for garlic.Had the potatoe soup - yum - and the avocado platter which was fantastic. Thankfully they don't make a garlic drink so I had the fresh juice instead. I think that had ginger in it.Overall it was a great experience and I will return. The other advantage is I won't be bitten by a vampire tonight.
4
Love to come here as I am a garlic lover! Yummy dishes with awesome service level. We ordered Garlic bread tower, Garlic sizzling rice, Carbonara etc. Recommended to try at least once!
5
This restaurant looks ordinary as one walks in. Once seated and greeted by a smiling host - one is quickly attended for ordering. I ordered spicy garlic pasta - the best I could have eaten anywhere in the world and very affordable.
4
Been to Mad for Garlic a couple of times. Brought my friends and my family on 2 different sessions and both parties love the food. I will recommend the garliholic rice and garlic snowing pizza.
3
I must admit the food was Amazing, However its a shame that their service staff don't complement well with their reputation. There was this waiter named D'Zul whom we felt pretty rude.
4
Repeat customers here and too bad they lost a star from a rude & don't want to belong there waiter Dzul ......

Visited on 30/6/2017 with my mother,this was my 2nd visited as previously was using The Entertainment App so was 1 for 1 main. Today was using fave voucher,paid $17.50 for $35 deal. Ordered Garlic Snowing Pizza,$23.50,is very crispy n yummy but waited quite awhile as the manager apologies that my order pizza was accidentally burned. Garlic Sizzling Bacon Rice,$21.50 was recommended by the lady as I'm allergy to shrimp,is yummy too.Rated very good for their service as find that they are courteous and friendly
4
The restaurant had a May Special offering 35% discount for lunch & dinner on weekdays. We went there for lunch on the first day of the offer on a Monday and showed them the ad posted on FB to claim the discount. My Wife ordered a plate of prawn & lobster cream pasta (really spaghetti) and opined that it was quite ordinary. I order the garlic steak and enjoyed it very much. Will certainly be back to try other Garlic items
3
Initially I was worried that there might be a strong Garlic aftertaste. Fortunately there was none. Some of the dishes such as the carbonara and honey pizza were tasty. The rest such as the nacho pizza or even the chilli pasta (I forgot the name) were mediocre. Even the dessert was a disappointment. The service crew were a let- down. They had sullen faces, not proactive to re- fill the water and they seem to be busy with stuff though there were only 4 tables occupied that night. Lastly, the address is not updated. It is not on the first floor of Tower 3 Suntec. It is on the second floor of tower 5 (near to convention centre). The only reason why I gave it 3 stars is that one of the service crew was very accommodating to us at the end of our dinner and helped us to take several group photos.

save your money and eat elsewhere i ordered a 220 rib eye and got a 150 sirloin with raw mushrooms starters did not come together i had finished mine before wife got herssame with main course The garlic bread tower is just a bit of french bread with garlic from a jar and butter pored in one end left to soak then when brought to your table, i can only describe that its is total mutilated in front of you to a point it put me off eating it.service was terrible very overrated wish i had when to the place oppositefood was bland yes there was lots of garlic but looked as if it was all out of a tin or jar with no tasteafter starter and main meal we had to get a McDonalds on way back to our hote

Went for Sunday lunch here as it was quite popular on social media. Also heard some good reviews about the food. It was empty except for one family when we got there. Did not feel welcomed at all. Service was bordering on bad. No smiles from the waiter and waitress. Asked for warm water but I got room temperature water (actually felt like it just came out of the tap). Asked for the waiter to change it for me, he took it without a word and gave me warm water, again without a word. Beginning to think if the staff are trained to not speak?When ordering, I asked what is the spaghetti like in the grilled chicken and pasta combo. The waitress answered that it's spaghetti only, I can't choose other types of pasta. Rephrased my question again to ask what kind of sauce is the spaghetti with and she answered me just oil. When my food came, the pasta wasn't "just oil". I think it had other things in it like onions, garlic and some kind of seafood flavour. It was really tasty, but kind of weird to be referred to just oil. The grilled chicken was quite good as well. However the plate it was served on was filthy. I could see the oil splatter all over the plate, shows that the plate was placed beside the stove throughout the cooking process and no attempts to clean up the plate before serving. Overall the taste of grilled chicken with pasta was good but cleanliness of plate was disgusting. My fiancÃ© ordered the dancing salsa rice with beef. Taste was alright, nothing special. Any hawker centre hotplate fried rice would have tasted the same if not better. The plating again was bad. It looked as if we were served leftovers (see photo). Overall, would not go back or recommend this place to anyone. Even if the other food that I have not tried is really good, I will not put myself through lousy service, dirty and bad presentations of food for the price paid.

Garlic snowing pizza - must order
Garlic rice with bacon - average with little ingredients
Carbonara - good but not extraordinary
Nacho pizza - skip, too overwhelming
I need a Good rating selection. This is not average neither very good.

We've been to the Clarke Quay outlet but this is our first at Suntec. Never fails to satisfy our cravings for risotto and pasta. Love the food as always. Will be coming back for more, especially with the Entertainer app.
4
~last May I'd come back for dinner with friends and the place was half filled in a sleepy end of the empty hallway~with more people we tried more items on the menu and nothing was half bad!~the garlickyness of everything served was unmistakable except for the cheese pizzaGarlic Bread Tower a nice tryTriple Garlic Seafood Pasta was super YUMzall the rice dishes we had were delicious YUMz x2although service wasn't as attentive we did have conversations with the more senior staff that did a good jo

Well, what's not to like, assuming you like it...., about Garlic and its enhancement for meals? We even had blueberries, Hagendas Vanilla ice cream and garlic..... yes a desert with garlic! Locals were drinking water not alcohol to accompany their food since besides full of garlic it is all spicy too....and tasty. As non locals....we had beer and then a glass of wine, both nice but perhaps in retrospect a wasted extravagance to join our spinach leaf starter and then succulent searing beef rice green beans, fried egg and spices. Total price with alcohol for two - each eating three courses but one coffee in March 2017 was Singapore Dollars 166.00. (About 118 $US)
2
the glass that was given to us for the water was not clean. soap residue is seen, not rinsed properly then it dried. good thing the glass for the lemonade was different and clean. this was the only thing that went right. foodthe pasta/lobster with white sauce - pasta was ok++. fish egg gives that crunchy feeling. taste was lacking, the seafood/lobster flavor was weak. could use a little more salt and pepper. the $37++ steak. nothing special on the meat, was ok. dip is ok++. i think you can have same experience somewhere else and cheaper. toasted baguette - ok. but should have been free given main dish is expensive. tony roma's had this free. unfortunately i can't recommend going to this place.
3
Been here a couple of times and always enjoyed garlicholic rice, garlic bread and snowing garlic pizza.In my recent visit, had mussels in tomato sauce which was good. Portion was generous and sauce was fantastic. Beef steak with gratin was pretty average. Steak doneness was not expected.Expect some waiting time if visiting during peak meal hours
4
A Korean fusion restaurant with tons of great garlic themed plates of innovations For a garlic lover like myself, love the heaps of crispy garlic chips & generous amount of cooked bulbs in hot plates Pizzas are a hit for the kids and the best kick is the hangover cure of Garlic Pasta (Super Spicy
4
Been here a few times. Love their snowing pizza and the steak with cheese gratin. The steak size is thick, juicy and very nicely done. The marinate is just delicious. The garlic fried rice was too salty during this visit. Environment wise it is a bit too dim for me and for some reason I always get a mosquito bite when I dine there. They need to seriously renovate and make the restaurant brighter, less woody and not so dim. It feels like being in a dracula castle with all the garlic hanging around :-)
2
Wanted to see what this restaurant will be like in terms of food , ambience and service. The frontage is ok with lots of garlic strands but apart from that I don't see why we should be MAD About Garlic !! Food was so so and the seafood pasta was way below similar dishes I have tried. The sauce was too saltish shd the seafood especially the mussels were over cooked. Pizza was nothing to shout about. Service is below average and it's just there to take orders and bring food. Korean concept so there were some Koreans there at lunch time. That's all I need to say for this place.
2
Went there with kids today afternoon. Ordered margarita pizza which was tomato paste with some cheap blob of cheese. The ham n sausage pizza which was supposed to be peppery was sweet. Oriental salad was full of mayo and sweet. Risteretto was fine. Overall not a place to go for the 2nd time. Kids said that Pizza Hut is much better.
1
Had spaghetti with seafood called "red devil", Prawns were stale. Even the Pizza was burnt at the sides.
The cashier was unfriendly and dumb and cannot answer any questions I have.
4
Delicious Garlic Snowing Pizza! It was so good! Also tried their Garlicious Fried Rice but it tasted really average and was a tad too pricey.
4
Tried the garlic steak with all assorted garlic. Diced, fried sliced and grilled.. the steak is quite nice and tender..
5
The name definitely does not sound as appetizing as the dishes. I absolutely love the food! The garlic steak and garlic snowing pizza with really flavourful and delicious.
4
We were there slightly early and ordered steaks. However the wait for the serve was slightly longer but the food tasted good!
5
Must order... Sizzling garlic fried rice, garlic steak and garlic bread! Price and portion is still considered ok.✌😉
3
This wasn't to my tastes as what I ordered did not come out as expected however the other people I was dining with loved it and they were able to get vegetarian meals. They liked the pizzas best of all as they were very thin crusted and large. Other dished had were a creamy pasta and the Teryaki Chicken and spaghetti - noting the 'plain' spaghetti was full of capers, onion and of course, garlic! If I went back here I would order the pizzas
5
When the name first come up I m worry it will be too garlic.... But not at all. Love their seafood pasta in soup ... So yummy .... Other dish like snowy pizza, mussel in pot, spinach with garlic, garlic tower ... Extremely nice So is definitely a place that I will go over and over again
4
Pros: The food was great! If I did not like garlic, I'd probably still like most of my dish-I got the pizza with garlic snow. It was sweet, salty and every mouthful was flavorful. I also liked the drama of them grinding the garlic to make the "garlic snow". Really keeping to the theme! Cons: The staff could have smiled or be more forthcoming with service. Also didn't really like the fact that ALL discounts (incl apps and credit card) were stopped on a holiday but I guess that can't be helped.

I am a Singaporean who seek to connect the world through travelling and sharing of experiences and knowledge. I believe FOOD is definitely one of the factor that bridge such ambition. I have been a person whom my friends look up to for food recommendations; from cheap hawker or road side food to pricy fine dining. So here we go!One of my favourtie mid price restaurant is Mad for Garlic. It has 2 outlet in Singapore. One at Suntec city and the other at Clarke Quay. I frequent this restaurant due to the unqie taste of its garlic themed foods.The Perfect FusionGarlic is one of the most important ingredient that you will find in many cuisine, especially that of Chinese. And much to my liking, Mad for Garlic, offers the unique fusion of garlic with Italian food. Garlic may not be in everyone's liking but you may be surprised that after a meal at this restaurant your perspective of garlic may change entirely. That was the case for a few of my friends who detested garlic initially. Price & Reservations It appears that the restaurant no longer accept any reservation (since early April 2016). Only walk in.Members like myself can receive 25% off the total bill. Alternatively, if you own a UOB card you may enjoy a 1 for 1 treat or discount which varies periodically. If you have neither I would say it isn't too pricy to dine in anyways. You can expect to spend approx. Sgd80 for 3 to 4 pax (2 mains one pizza one starter)Starter price range between Sgd 10 to 15.Main course and pizzas starts from Sgd15 onwards. RecommendationsFor 2 to 4 pax, I would recommend that you order 2 mains 1 pizza and 1 side. And add on additional if you find it not filling enough later on. This is really filling despite being a big eater myself.For starter: Caesar salad is a must have. A good mix of the bacons alongside a good sprinkle of cheddar cheese on the salad makes it really addictive. You can give a skip to garlic tower, as the taste is used to be better in the past. For main: Garlic sizzling rice, lobster cream pasta or arriabita pasta are highly recommended For pizza: As exaggerating as it may sound, you can give any of the above a miss but not this; the garlic snowing pizza. Addictive to the core. The taste of Hawaiian pizza fused with garlic bits on the thin crust, makes you wanna order just one more and eat it all for yourself. The ambience of each outlet slightly differs with the one at Clarke Quay being a little more classy. But regardless both outlets are good in general
5
This is a genuine Italian restaurant serving excellent food. The aroma of garlic is simply mouth watering. But it is not the place for those who do not like garlic. The pizzas and pastas are very good and certainly worth a visit.
3
I always love the food at mad for garlic, but the service at the Suntec city outlet is bad.
They are not friendly, and it seems like they pretend not too see you when you ask them to refill water.
4
overall the food is great except for the coffee, kind of diluted and not my cup of 'tea'! service is great and the staff are always ready to be on hand with their sweet smile!
3
The pasta was actually quite average. Only came here because of the Entertainer 1-for-1 app. Otherwise not worth it.
4
A great restaurant for Garlic lovers, mainly Italian inspired food but with a twist. One of my favourites in Suntec.
5
The service there is no doubt excellent. My server, Emma (korean lady) is fantastic.
Food were generally pretty good. Would go for seconds on their hot seller pizza!
4
This is a good place to have really unique food like the signature garlicpeno pasta and snow garlic pizza! Too bad they close the Clarke quay branch. Could have been amazing! Use to go there every week!Think the garlic not jus wade vampire but human

Visited on 5thAug'16 w my mother around 12pm+ for the Entertainer App 1 for 1 deal. Restaurant already one third full. I ordered Garlic Snowing Pizza, $22.50, when served, the girl will asked whether we want any mozzarella cheese to be sprinkle on top of the pizza. It is full of shrimps, garlic flakes, it have a nice cheese flavour n thin crust is crispy. Garlicholic Rice $18.50, can request for spicy or non spicy. It is yummy, even though its looks like oily but doesn't feel oily when eating. Overall spend $35.90 for 2 person. Food is tasty n service is good as all crews r friendly n attentive. Will definitely visited again. Actually, thought food will have strong garlic smell n taste but is not at all.
4
The meal itself quite tasteful and the size just nice. You can share 2 main course so that able to try more variety of courses. Price-wise quite expensive but if you can get some deal (ie. Qoo10, Groupon, credit card promotion), then it would be much better. Service during our visit was almost inexistence, during peak hours, just expect to get your order in time and right, while some of the staff still offer a smile, other (in our case) the cashier, don't even smile at all when we process the payment. The place very nice and comfy to hang out
4
1st time trying this restaurant. Ordered the signature Garlic Snowy pizza and Garlic Fried rice. The garlic snowy pizza has a sweet base but we top it with lotsa cheese so the taste is sort of neutralised. Garlic fried rice tastes abit like Pepper Lunch rice with honey garlic sauce.
5
Excellent Italian food. Loved the taste and aroma of garlic. Prices are little on the higher side. But service is fast. Pizzas crust were rather too thin and crisp but toppings were good.
5
We stopped in for a quick lunch. Despite ordering steamed mussels, pizza and spaghetti carbonara we were served very quickly. Steamed mussels were spectacular and the other meals were equally as good. Excellent service and great food made for a very nice meal.
5
Frequently dine here and the food never disappoints! We always order these: garlic snowing pizza, garlicpeno pasta and beef salsa rice and each time the food is consistently good and delucious. Kids love the pizza so much!
3
We decided to lunch here while shopping and it was pretty good though our pizza was just fair. It was very thin but the crust needed body and crispness. The Caesar salad however was quite nice.
4
Went to Mad for Garlic for lunch - ordered the special Nacho Pizza. Best description : 👍👍👍 unique taste. Price is a little bit steep but definitely will come back but probably not as often. Worth a try.
4
I had lunch at the Suntec City branch with a friend and had a Spicy fried rice, and Garlic Snowing Pizza. Food was garlic-ky enough for a garlic fan like me, and service was impeccable. Staff kept coming over to make sure we were ok and topped up our glasses of water.
3
Food was really worth the money! Very yummy!! However the waiting time was way too long. Approx 30-45 mins serving time. My second visit here and food takes forever to serve! The Korea waitress was really patience and nice however one of the manager at the cashier was really rude when we were having hiccups over the entertainer app. She didn't even offer her help when she see us struggling and didn't thank us after we make payment! How rude
2
We came to Mad for Garlic at Suntec because we loved the food we had in Seoul, Korea. We had high expectations especially for the same dishes we had in Korea. Boy! We swear never to come back. The service was good though but out of three dishes we ordered, only one was good. We sent one back ie mussels in cream sauce as they were overcooked and just tasted bad. The manager was gracious not to charge us for that dish. The ham and sausage white sauce pizza was way too sweet. It was just strange to taste mayonnaise (or something similar) on a pizza. I thought it would just be cheese on pizza so I didn't have much of pizza at the end. I like the pasta though. We ordered the signature garlic pasta that has a bit of anchovy. This is the dish we didn't order in Korea and it turned out well. The bill was about $20-25 per person which is very reasonable.
4
This place is good for people who have a strong liking for garlic, as its literally garlic snowing everywhere. The food taste is good, although for vegetarians its pretty less. Nevertheless the starters, the pizzas and the pastas are good. This place majorly serves wine and has some good collection of the same. You also have some great varieties of mussel cuisines. The garlic content also makes most of cuisines a little more intense for the taste buds and hence it is recommended for people who are nothing short of garlicholics. The place can be very crowded on weekends, but all in all a good place to try
2
We ordered 3 mains and a shared starter. The starter arrived after the first main with the next main arriving 10-15 minutes later and the last main approx 5 mins after that. Overall the last main arrived 45 minutes after ordering. If that wasn't bad enough my main of fillet steak was served on a bed of cold potato mash. After pointing this out to the waitress my plate was returned to the kitchen, after 5-10 mins my meal was brought back to me and I have no idea what was done as the potato was still cold. Poor service and cold food.
3
Their food had a good taste, but it took very long time. We're waiting for more than 30 minutes. It will not be a good choice if you need to have a lunch in one hour.
4
Been here once because i had a voucher and had some nice pizza (snow pizza)
When I realize i could get 50% off we decided to come. Steak , snow pizza and the garlic bread was very good value because it was half price.
3
Can't say very tasty, average. Evironment okay, comfortable. Service is good. Food selections from salad, pizza, spaghetti. Nothing much really impressed me much, standard meal.
3
Inexpensive food, nothing fancy. An easy option if you are looking for a quick bite to eat. Dont think i would bother going back again, as there are better options.

Mad for Garlic is Koreaâ€™s first garlic-themed Italian restaurant and with its unique and innovative menu saturated with garlic-specialized Italian cuisine, along with an excellent selection of wines, Mad for Garlic soon became one of Korea's most popular restaurant chains. Needless to say there is a branch in Singapore and it is in Suntec City. So for all you garlic lovers and skeptics alike, Mad for Garlic is one place you should definitely check out; your outlook on garlic will definitely change!The fluffy Garlic Baguettes were a delightful start to the dinner; soft fluffy garlic buttery goodness on the inside and nice and crisp on the outside. 2 pieces (half) for S$4.50 and 4 pieces (full) for S$8.50. Garlicpeno Pasta was simple, but full of garlic goodness and springy tasty spaghetti with a bit of spice. The Mad Mexi Nacho Pizza (S$23.50) was an interesting delight of minced beef topped with generous portions of nachos, a top a thin crust pizza pastry; served with salsa on the side
4
The chicken rissotto was awesome, you'll find yourself can't stop dig in. My husband had garlic beef steak which was also great. Thou' the price very high at least we end up satisfy with our meal, drink and service. The place always full but they always serve us nice.
3
The discount applicable for Mad for garlic is quite substantial when dining for 2 (50%). The dishes available for selection are as per the menu. Tried the steak, garlic fried rice, and Lobster Pasta. They are all ok... nothing spectacular nor poor. I might just pop by again, for a simple and fuss free meal.
3
Walked around the Suntec mall got lost and ran into Mad for Garlic. As I love garlic I couldn't resist. Had a bacon, garlic and spinach salad to start which was perfect. I found the menu a bit boring and it looked like being a chain whereas I was expecting a more individual experience. Overall the meal was good and great they offer a carafe of wine option!! Happy days
3
~my wife & I took a detour above the Suntec West Atrium and discovered Mad for Garlic at the end of the hallway where Din Tai Fung is (ikr yeah)~she ordered the Red Seafood Soup Pasta and it arrived fastest with a spicy tomato broth but she could not eat it for the mussels were all not fresh, they came out mushy :(~Thankfully the manager change it to the White Seafood Soup Pasta without mussels but the taste wasn't as great :(~the Steak & Garlicpeno Rice Combo I had was much better with vinegar dressing on rockets, a really tender steak cooked medium rare and garlic rice that is tastyIf only for my wife, we should have gone to Din Tai Fung :
3
Gorgonzola cheese pizza eaten with honey dip was a nice compliment of salty and sweet. Garlic snowing pizza had bits of pineapple and shrimp with cheese grated over hence the snowing term. Preferred the gorgonzola over the snowing pizza. We also had Garlicpeno pasta and the Garlicholic rice was a tad to spicy for my liking despite us asking for the heat to be reduced. The Lobster cream pasta fared better than the other two, meat was tender and the cream wasnt overkill
4
I am a sucker for garlic so any dish with heavy garlic seasoning suits me sooo well. They should add more food items as I find the menu quite limited. Ambiance and service is good.
4
Loved the service, food and ambience. Ordered a snow pizza, lobster pasta and steak garlic (recommend all these 3 best dishes). Highly recommend this restuarant if you are game for a night of garlic.
5
I have been to this restaurant multiple times and it was all just for the risotto. Granted, I doubt I have extremely high standards for risotto as I have not tried many, but the risotto from Mad for Garlic really suited my tastes down to the T. Sadly, I cannot say the same for its famous garlic snowing pizza. I like it, but not love it.On a side note, my mom loves the pumpkin spicy cream pizza
5
Came here for a dinner with the husband. Had an appetizer of baguette garlic bread. I dare say its one of the best garlic bread I've ever eaten in Singapore. The baguette is toasty and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The is ample amount of garlic butter spread on each baguette. You can order half (2 pieces) or full (4 pieces). For mains, we ordered Gorgonzola pizza and Garlic snowing pizza. Gorgonzola pizza is a cheese based pizza eaten with honey. Garlic snowing pizza has diced pineapple, shrimp and garlic. Both pizza taste really good. In summary if you don't mind having a wonderful garlicky dinner with your date, choose to eat here with the awesome food, service and ambiance
4
Heard good reviews of the new "Korean Pizza" and went down to Suntec to give it a go. Ordered the Garlic snowing cheese pizza and the BBQ Chicken Ham and wasn't disappointed. The snowing cheese uses fresh shrimp toppings with fresh grated parmesan cheese. Great tasting due to a unique sweet sauce that makes all the difference. The BBQ is above average and slightly spicy. The downside is the below average service for the above average prices
3
My wife and I ate here tonight, the food was good quality and value for money however the service staff were unfriendly and to be honest came across as if they did not want to be there if that makes any sense!? i would eat here again purely based on the meal
4
Mad of garlic is a wonderful Italian Restaurant located in Suntec City and Clarke Quay. The one main feature about Mad For Garlic that separates itself from other restaurant is their unique style of dishes. As the title might probably suggest the dishes are all garlic-themed, which is absolutely fabulous and overall the dishes were very good in imy opinionA further insight to this restaurant along with ratings of each dish I had sampled can be seen in my review on my blog '22 Food Street' at http://22foodstreet.blogspot.sg/2014/10/mad-for-garlic-suntec-city.html I am new to blogging and restaurant reviewing and your support would mean a lot to me. Please continue to follow my blog and don't hesitate to read the other restaurants I have reviewed and have a wonderful read! Thanks

We went there twice for dinner and both times the service was excellent. According to the family, the garlic bread was really nice, pizzas were great and the risottos and pasta dishes were delicious. With 3 Coeliacs in our family, finding a restaurant that served gluten free in Singapore was challenging so we were delighted to find Mad for Garlic at Clark Quay who were knowledgeable about gf food. Our 12 year old children requested no pepper or spice in their risottos which were then demolished with gusto and declared the best meal ever
4
Wasn't expecting it to be great, it was more than!! The food was really tasty and so garlic. Best garlic bread I have ever had! Had a starter which was garlic and chillies in hot oil with toasted bread. That was ok but quirky. Had steak with garlic and another garlic rice dish. Sooooo tasty. Loved it.
5
I visited Mad for Garlic for lunch with my family. when I asked them to adjust Garlic sizzling rice to non-spicy for the kids, they willing to do that especially for us. (good point).So many good option for vegetarian, non-garlic lover also but my favourite menu is Mad Maxi Nacho Pizza! Really unique and tasty for sure!
4
Found this place by accident but had to try it. All the best of an Italian restaurant and with extra garlic!
5
I did enjoy many kind of pizza in Mad for Garlic. Garlic snowing pizza and shrimp pasta are my favourite. The staff is so friendly. Recommended
3
Been to this rastaurant for the 1st time during gathering with my sisters.
Generally the food are normal but it worth to have a try of whats the foods indeed sell by this restaurant but the atmosphere certainly nice.
4
I tried them the first time when they newly opened in Singapore, approx 5 or 6 years ago. We chose the creamiest menu with most garlic, and afterwards, I told myself, this would be my first and last time eating here, but then just yesterday, one of my biz partners treated me to this place, and chose garlicpeno pasta, mussels in tomato sauce and I was sold! 2nd time was indeed a charm! :
4
I've come to Mad for Garlic several times before - in a nutshell, if you like garlic and don't mind paying for smaller than usual portions, you'll have a pleasant enough experience. I'd say good for the food and average for the rest.Top on my list is the Garlicpeno pasta, which is a lovely blend of al dente pasta, fried garlic and jalapeÃ±o peppers. This dish is way hot and the first time I tried it my lips were on fire! You can ask the kitchen to dial back on the spiciness and the level of heat is just right then.Another dish that I like is the Gorgonzola cheese pizza. The honey dipping sauce that accompanies the pizza makes it a delectable combo. The pizza crust is thin though, so if you're looking for a thick crust you'll be disappointed.Overall the food is the best thing about the place. It takes a while for the food to come out and the waitstaff aren't the friendliest or most personable.

A group of 7 from our office had a weekday lunch here. The kitchen staff must have been on their lunch break at the same time as us! One meal came out very slowly and on its own. The rest followed nearly 10 minutes later. $160 bill for mediocre food and slow service. I won't be hurrying back there

I went to Mad for Garlic for having a platter of Garlic Bread. It was worth the waiting. However, this place is known for Snowing Pizza. I did not like this ; may be my pizza was pure veg.Garlic Ice cream is worth tasting

Went as garlic lovers and the garlic bread was good then waited for ages before my husbands main was served and then waited another 20 minutes for my meal l to arrive. After that asked for the bill and had to wait for that too. Food was nice enough but won't be going back

We used the DBS Mobile App 1-for-1 promo for dinner, bought the Gorgonzola pizza and garlic snowing pizza. It was our second visit to Mad for Garlic.... I don't remember the pizza crust being so paper thin!! Hubby joked that it was "tissue pizza "!The pizza tasted great. Loved the fried garlic taste in the garlic snowing pizza. Honey that came with Gorgonzola pizza was great, since the kids didn't quite take to the blue cheese flavor. Excellent decor. We were seated quickly despite the Mothers' Day crowd at Suntec.

We have been there for dinner and it was very disapointing!Staff was not attentive, food was uneatable spicy (and I am used to eat spicy) and they really charge you 8,70 Dollar for two tiny slices of garlic bread!!! This is ridiculous and way overpriced!!!The only reason why I give two points instead of one is because they did not charge the uneatable spicy plate - which was fair enough

The banana chocolate pizza was simply awesome. Mushroom risotto is worth a try too!! A friend from London likes it too ;)

Very delicious food and drinks, good services and reasonable price.
Recommend to go at non peak hours and before the night scene of the area start for families.

I had two very nice dining experience at the Mad for Garlic restaurant in Manila quite recently and when I learn that there were two outlets in Singapore, I brought my family for lunch at Clarke Quay. We were disappointed with our lunch. No service at all as the Indian staff were all chatting away. And I have to call them to take my order, ask for drinking water and reminded them when it took them a long time to bring a glass of Coke. The stale Coke came without gas. The Dracula Killer was a great disappointment, totally different from what I had in Manila. The bread was not toasted with garlic butter and came plain. The garlic served in oil was tasteless. The Garlic Snowing pizza was very dried. The garlic carbonara and lobster cream pasta were both tasteless. The clam and seafood pasta was OK but I think the prawn was not fresh. I have tried out almost 80% of the dishes in the menu at the Manila restaurant and could not find any fault with the excellent meal and service. But sadly, the Singapore restaurant is below par

This place is a Italian restaurant where every dish has any influence of garlic. Food was soso. But the cocktails where great.Waiters are sellers as they recommend you the most expensive item on the menu.Its also quite inflexible, no exchange of ingredients possible. If u don't like fish in ur pasta - no pasta! Basta

My first visit at lunch time to Mad For Garlic. We had a very wide smattering of orders starting with the Dracula Killer to the garlic flavored ice cream. In between we had 2 pizzas, 2 pastas an done seafood salad. There was a problem with the Cabonara and we had to return it. However, the Dracula Killer was a nice surprise appetiser while the seafood salad was ok. The pizzas were excellent and I was told it only takes 3 minutes to go from preparation to serving. Impressive. Will be back. Bottom line is that I have not tasted food like that with such a strong garlic focus. But don't get put off by the garlic. Its not as over powering as one would imagine. But you do have to get some mints later so you won't lose your colleagues. Price is leaning towards the high side. Average price is about s$30.0

Nice family restaurant for Italian food. The restaurant is nicely decorated with garlic hanging off the walls. The big booths are comfy and can accomodate large groups of people. The restaurant was small so we had to wait a while for our seats inside. Service is slow but the food is pretty decent. It is on its expensive side though so be prepared to pay up

My family accompanied me on two occasions to Mad for Garlic, and we felt unsatisfied both times. The array of items we sampled were delicious, but the combination of high cost and smaller portion-size undercut our otherwise favorable impressions of this restaurant.The garlic-centric menu is an interesting novelty, but it doesn't excuse the alarming expense of dinner for a family of four

My friend and I arrived at Mad For Garlic at around 730pm on a Thursday evening, without prior reservation. We were greeted by this staff we believe is the floor manager. With a smile, he immediately led us in to a table. Menus were already on the table so we dove right into deciding on our mains. It took us a while because we were pretty undecided. We finally settled on 2 mains and a side which was the garlic bread tower (i believe) which was garlic bread with raw garlic bits. While I had made up my mind on my main course, my friend had a few queries and had to find out if they could adhere to her complicated request. When the Floor manager came over to take our orders, she brought up her requests, all of which, they are unable to do and mentioned to us that they could only go to the extend of switching up the spiciness level of foods but are unable to change things around, which he apologised for. She then decided on a different main altogether (Dancing Salsa Beef Rice), while I got the Mushroom & Spinach Risotto which came with a huge chunk of very tenderly grilled chicken thigh. Because they weren't able to make my friend's special requests, the floor manager very nicely offered us complimentary drinks of our choice, out of the wine menu which was a very nice gesture. Speaking of gestures, while we were waiting for our food to arrive, we were brought our drinks first which also came with 2 cups of water which the waiter had placed by the edge of the table. So as we were talking, my friend made a gesture which unfortunately, knocked over the cup of water. The cup was fine but the floor became a mini pool. Immediately, a female wait staff came over with a bunch of napkins to offer both ourside and the table next to us. The next thing we knew, she was down on her knees soaking up the water with napkins! This is something that I've NEVER seen before, usually the staff gets a mop out (yes, in the middle of a dining room with food around) and just mops but no one goes down on their knees to SOAK up water with napkins. I was very impressed at her quick reaction. After all the hoo-ha, we continued talking and after a while, realised that we have not seen the service staff leave yet, so i took a peek and she was STILL soaking up the remaining bit of water. Now, on to the food. The dancing salsa beef rice was pretty much fried rice with an egg, beef and some salsa served on a hotplate. The waiter would come by and ask if you'd want him/her to mix it up for you which my friend agreed to. This particular service staff was a little rough and as he was mixing, we saw rice fly out, along with a good piece of beef. However, the portions are pretty reasonable so it wasn't a terrible lost but it wasn't nice to see either. My risotto came and it was AMAZING. Creamy & cheesy but not overpowering with a good mushroom taste. The spinach was very subtle, almost non-existent but I think it works. The chicken was SO GOOD. Tender, juicy and everything in between! I was in heaven and even though I was stuffed, i couldn't let the risotto go to waste so i finished the last bit. It was a good thing I had a cup of hot green tea with me. All in all, it was good food with great service and I am planning my next visit already for a good risotto fix although, I really should try their other food items available..

I'm not sure what the theme is; the decor is all garlic and wine. Is it supposed to remind me of an Italian vampire cemetary? Kinda dark.They don't hold reservations past 7pm so if you are meeting after work, best to make sure at least one of you can get there before 7pm and wait for the rest, lest you lose the table you reserved.The Garlic Snowing pizza thingamajig was nice but best eaten warm (pls share!). The steak cam with enough garlic to make EDWARD turn pale(r). Seafood pasta is a recommended dish. So is the butter garlic shrimp dish with the spicy sauce to kick things up a notch.But truly not the BEST place we've had pizza/steak/shrimps. Kinda expensive. If you wanna just try, go ahead. It's not bad. If you are choosy, cook at home
