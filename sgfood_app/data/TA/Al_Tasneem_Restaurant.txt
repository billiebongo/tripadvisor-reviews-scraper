Thank you mr nadeem to recommend us chicken briyani. This is our first time try indian food and we love it. The portion is big enough and serve with big chicken.. The butter chicken is delicious..

Definitely will not recommend this restaurant. Waited for a while for the Prata to be served and it was not fresh. Quality of other food is bad, gravy was terrible!

Delicious chicken murtabak with a thick luscious curry sauce washed down with hot tea tarik. Heaven! We would go out of our way to return to such a friendly place.

Stopped here for some late night murtabak before heading home. Quite tasty and served efficiently. Not too oily either. Potentially worth another visit.

Best murtabak in Singapore! And a great spot to sit, enjoy a mango lassi and watch the passersby. You don't suffer the glamour-effect of it's commercial neighbour, Sam Sam, and the food is superb.The staff have that authentic helpfulness, where they don't gloat over you for service - they just provide it.A must visit for any trip to Singapore

We have many fond memories of our Singapore trip last year Al-tasneem being one of them.Oohh my mouth start watering the moment i think of it.It was very near our hotel The Village Bugis and opposite to mosque.Ul..ti..mate food!!!!We had Murtabak,Lambshank and Biryani.So well cooked.Thou this small restaurant is on roadside with simple furniture but the food being so good one doesn't mind such ambience .Infact it's nice to watch people passing by.The staff is very friendly and helpful and gave us few tips about city tour.A biggg Thumbs U

This place offers great delecious food at reasonable prices. But very small seating space and one has to sit on the tables laid out on the side walk. We ordered some Butter chicken and some breads. All the items were delecious and were dripping in butter. Quality ingredients used

The best mango lasi i have ever had! It is not the type of restaurant you choose to go for dinner, it's not very clean and fashionable but the food is excellent! Great murtabak - it is worth to be eaten on a dirty table just in the street

Really enjoyed the food here , better than zam zam next door which caters to tourists more as it's famous , can sit on the side watch the world go by and eat drink and enjoy great inexpensive food all the time and cheap and clean

This is one of the busy restaurants by the Bugis area. It is located at a corner of a roll of shophouses overlooking a mosque.Staffs are ready to serve and I had a cold teh tarik as a drink during a hot afternoon.The teh tarik is prepared well and the sweetness is just nice for me. Tastes even better while it's cold to refresh myself in the hot weather.The place is reasonably clean and the set up of the place gave you a feel of the local vibe

I am a solo traveller and this food is amazing. The price is so cheap and the serves are huge. I would recommend this place to my friends and trust me, I am a seriously picky eater

Great food and great location.. the Mamak style always. very fast service and reasonable price. Many locals and foreigners that loves Indian food will always visited this place. They even open when the others are closed for festive holidays.
4
They have air-conditioned dining room on the 2nd floor. Food taste may be good, but overpowered with spices. Prices are friendly. Everything here is halal.
4
Be it for Indians, Singaporean, Malaysian or non-Asian, this place is for all.. One of the best Biryani in town.. Though it looks more of Hawker's place it is a must try eatery in the town. Highly recommended. Huzayf

the best ever mutton briyani you ever get in singapore! better than zam zam. zam zam is horrible for mutton briyani nowadays - maybe their (zam zam) murtabak is good
5
I'm really not that familiar with indian food, but the lamb shank biryani was really really tasty and it comes in BIG Portion! Tried the mutton murtabak and loved it as well!
4
When we got there for breakfast, they didn't have the murtabak ready until 11AM so we ordered cheese Roti prata served with curry, it was ok but the curry was tasty! The waiters were very polite and what i liked the most is the location, just across the sultan mosque. What a view
5
Had Parrata with Butter chicken & tea very good taste , Helpful staff , They have some good menus like deer biriyani , couldn't try it , But the taste of the food is good and was high quality ,Almost a convenient street restaurant

Egg prata $2 and curry mutton $4. Good food and reasonable price. For me the food taste is better than Zam Zam. Service also better and faster. And you dont have to pay service charge. In zam zam if you order less than 10$ you should pay 1$ charge
4
My daughter and I popped I here and going to the mosque over the road - and we're glad we did. We ordered a couple of Roti Prata with the veggie curry sauce and they were both delicious. The guys there were very friendly and helpful and we will definitely return.
4
Freshly made roti Prata with thick and generous curry gravy. Yummy and cheap. The Teh Halia is very good too. Can't find good Prata shops these days.
5
Better than Zam Zam and victory! Loved the murtabak! Great friendly staff and a good location full of culture
4
one of the best restaurants in Singapore! the food was delicious and the service was great. will definitely be going back!

One of the best biryani's everrrrrrrrr, so fluffy and fragrant. Al tasneem is DEFO my favourite for their unique deer murtabak :) service is great too.
1
Wanted to buy dishes with rice for 1 for takeaway. What would have cost me $2-3 in many "mixed rice" or "economy rice" or even nasi Padang stalls, came up to $6.50 here! What a rip-off! Ordered plain rice with 2 vegetable dishes and a chicken dish. And the chicken came in small pieces, unlike a drumstick or a thigh. I told them that this would be my first and last time ther
2
Bought briyani rice and murtabak here to give a try after a bad experience from victory and zam zam before.The food was the same. real lousy, no standard in the briyani dishes, its just ghee rice with mutton and gravy, malays called it Nasi Minyak. The murtabak was rubbery ( Rubber texture , the dough was not of good quality like the one they knead themselves ) Lack of mutton and eggs in their murtabak. Mutton portion was big for the briyani, but lacking spices. Overall, Thumbs down flor this restaurant as well .No more going to these establishments

I am from the UK and I visited Singapore for the first time last year. I was craving for some asian food and luckily I came across Al Tasneem on the net. I told all my family about this restaurant and we decided to check it out. We ordered the mutton biryani, mutton murtabak, chicken biryani and plain parata. I must say I was mesmerised to see that staff had so much knowledge about the food and they helped us order the perfect amount. My order arrived in time and it was absolutely delicious. All the dishes we ordered were mouth watering. I couldnâ€™t believe that the asian food in Singapore would taste so divine and at such a reasonable price. I surely recommend everyone to visit this restaurant. We visited this place twice before we left for the UK

We ate the lamb shank briyani! It was superb! I would definately definately definaty recommend this to my colloegues and friends! , not only the lamb shank, but also the delicious murtabak, and after having all the heavy food we had some lassi, (yogurt drink) to cool our digestive system down, thank you so much al tasneem

My mouth waters thinking about the food at this amazing place! As soon as you enter the place you can smell the best Indian food ever. The ambience is fun and hip and Biryani is a must try! It was the best Biryani I have ever had. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants To try scrumptious Indian food in Singapore
