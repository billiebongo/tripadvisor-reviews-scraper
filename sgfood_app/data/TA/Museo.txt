Without fail, food and service always impresses me and my guests. Love the portion sizes. Flavourful and a wide variety of dishes to pick from in really manageable sizes. Desserts are fantastic too. Will be back.

We went there for afternoon tea but only found out that they stop serving afternoon tea couple months back and hence we were disappointed.
5
came here with a friend. the food is really nice and yummy with great ambience. we had foie gras, deep fried cheese, carb meat agile olio, escargot, lobster and wagyu. portion is just right.
4
Food is nice and presentable! Quiet place to have dinner.
Is a quiet peaceful birthday for my hubby!
4
Ordered a Two-way lobster served with barley risotto and Wagyu Rib Eye this time. Two-way lobster is just nice for lunch while rib eye of beef is a bit heavy.
Tried Mezzanine Signatures last visit, good for high-tea.
4
first time visiting museo. food is costly and not worth the price as it is very small portion. but overall the food is awesome.
5
Great food, ambience and service from friendly staff. Each dish is immaculately prepared!! 100% will make a return to this restaurant.
5
3rd time here, prior 2 visits were for dessert and art jamming. Was able to come here for lunch to try their interesting dishes, each carefully prepared and served in a round glass (gold-fish) bowl. Try the angel hair pasta and lamb rack! The art jamming session was great, no time limits, an open bar, and accompanied by some nice sound tracks. Will definitely come back again

Everything at the restaurant was great, the service, the food and the ambience. I was there to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend. We ordered around 9 bowls of their "Tapas" and was delighted with it. All of the food we ordered tasted great. The staff also made a very good recommendation of a bottled of red wine. We enjoyed our time there. The only downside of the restaurant was it's air-conditioning. Certain parts of the restaurant were cold beyond words. Other than that, I think we will be back soon.

A quaint tapas restaurant in a relatively touristy Santosa Quayside area. The food was delicious (the bowls are slightly too modern!) and the service was attentive but not intrusive. Since itâ€™s on the 2nd floor we imagine that the view will be much nicer during the day for lunch or afternoon tea. They also have canvas painting (art jam) available. We had tuna, squid ink risotto, the beans and the bread & butter pudding. They were all fantastic.
5
Great ambience, great experience and amazing food! Had a 4 course dinner with my boyfriend on our anniversary and the service was really good as well!
4
Really good ambience! Staff are also very friendly! I really love how stunning the serving plates look and how they even provide colourful pencils to draw with while waiting for the food. The food can come a little faster tho!
4
The staff were friendly and attentive. Food portion was good and I fell in love with their ice pomelo tea. Will definitely be back soon!
5
Went for lunch on a Sunday and ordered the NDP promotion of 10 cups of food (chef's selection) for the 3 of us. The food was really good and portion was reasonably big. The chef's selection was met with approval by us with a variety of selections from the meat, seafood, veg, soup and dessert menu. Service was excellent and we enjoyed some colouring activity before the food came. Ambience was cosy with tasteful displays and yet casual enough to sit back and enjoy a lazy weekend.
4
Had a great brunch time in Museo. We sit by the window, shoes off, feeling relax lazing against the cushions, enjoying the peace & nice tea, & coloring the colour sheet lay out on the table. We ordered a squid ink pasta & a french toast, looking out the window occasionally & enjoy the scenery below. We spend a good 3 hrs quiet time there & complete the colour 'project'. It will be good if they can change the colour sheet monthly so that when we visit again, we can colour a different design

I've had dinner at Museo before and loved the very interesting food, good service and great ambience. I recently took my grandson there for dinner on a Sunday evening. We arrived before 7 and the restaurant was very quiet. We were served promptly by a charming waitress and the food was as good as in the past. When we had finished we waited for more than 10 minutes for someone to clear the plates, offer a dessert menu and maybe another glass of wine for me. Eventually I saw a waiter sitting some distance away, looking at his phone, so in the end I had to call out to attract his attention. He did then clear the table and brought a dessert menu when we asked for one but did not ask if I wanted another glass of wine. We decided not to have a dessert but I ordered an espresso. He came back to say that the machine was not working! We left.Museo was not busy that evening but we left before 8pm so weren't exactly keeping people up. It's a pity that such poor service was allowed to spoil what should have been a nice dinner
3
My fiancée reserved a table to celebrate my birthday and had previously made a special request. The food was good. There is the 3-4 course set dinner which is worth the money. View was great as well. However, we waited too Long for the food to be served. 2 hrs exactly. And it really disrupted our plans for the evening. Was quite frustrating. Also, my fiancée requested a birthday cake with the following message: "would like to request a birthday cake for my fiancé." True enough, after hours of waiting, the cake finally came. The cake came with the Birthday message-" fiancé happy birthday." So now my name is fiancé ? If the name is unknown, you could have just written happy birthday instead ? We laughed about it but yea. Bad and Long service.
5
After 45 yrs on this planet i have eaten a lot of food.... and this restaurant would be in the top five i have ever eaten... we are talking Michelin hat territory... seriously a great meal.... and i should add great service especially by the Aussie waitress
5
Great view of the entire Quayside Isle as Museo is one of the few restaurants located on the second level. While outdoor seating is available, I would advise sitting indoors to fully immerse yourself in the gorgeous interior design and romantic ambience. The air con also provides a respite from the heat;) They have also an adorable space for painting (art jamming) and you get to bring home your painting nicely packed afterwards. That's a really ingenious idea, if you ask me. Love the unique dine-in-a-cup concept which allows one to try more dishes in one seating. Dishes are beautifully plated and taste as good as they look. Definitely a great place for dinner dates or weekend brunc
5
I have been to Museo countless time, mainly for their atmosphere (esp the sofa seats) and tea! Additionally, the staff there are all very friendly. Both thumbs up! I'm always looking forward to visit Museo. A place where never fail to make me and my partner feel happy at. :
5
been here twice, once for their desserts that were pretty decent, and a second time to check out their artjam. enjoyed the artjam experience, nice chill music, no time limits, a full bar to quench your thirst. will come back again!
4
Place is nice and quiet.
Food is average.
If there is service of the sentosa entry fee, it's better.
4
Seafood was not too good but the rest of the food was great
Table was a bit dirty but overall great place to hang out
5
A must visit place for those who wants a place to chill, those who love to draw and paint will be a plus point as you can have your own canvas to draw on and take home after that!
5
The place was lovely with a good view. Food came in mini bowls, tapas style. Great for ladies who wanna try a bit of everything. Service was ok, friendly but a little slow.
4
Love the flavourful Wagyu beef and smoked salmon, Museo gives a good ambience on the second level. Overall good dining experience
4
Two friends and I spent Sunday lunch at Museo's. It was leisurely, the service was attentive without being intrusive & overall a pleasant atmosphere. Food was creative & delicious and the wine selection varied, including by the glass.
4
Second time here, and the food is just as good. We greatly enjoyed the fusion between East and West. Serving sizes are small, which allows you to sample a large variety of their delicious offerings. Their fusion style Satay was really good, but the lamb rack needed a little more spice. They also carry a good tea selection by Arteastiq.Ambience was relaxing, with a cosy and warm atmosphere. Recommend booking if you want a unique sofa seat as these are limited. During our first trip, we also did some art jamming in the afternoon and it was a fun experience.
5
This is the fourth time I have returned and the food never fails to amaze me. Served in little glass bowls, they seem to be bite sized at first but never underestimate the portions, they can be rather filling by the time you reach the dessert. Each and every dish has its own unique flavourand texture and amazingly none of them were boring on the palate. Ambience is plush and cosy. Music can be turned down a notch. Missed those days when they had live music. Keep up the awesome work guys
4
I went to Museo on my anniversary.Staff were polite to my needs and allowed my booking to be pushed back as I wanted to walk around Sentosa Cove first. Very nice place with good soft music as well. My date and I enjoyed it. We spilled our drink and they gave us a new cocktail - much appreciated!Food - the food in the cup was fantastic. We had the lobster bisque and pork belly with German mustard. However, the mains was found to be a little wanting... I asked for rare ribeye beef, but had raw instead - they took it back to recook but I knew it would probably come back overdone and it did. Had medium well instead. The cod and risotto was normal as well with the risotto way too dry for it to be considered risotto.Overall, I would still go back but perhaps just for drinks and for the tapas food. Probably will stay away from the mains
5
Love the dining concept and style of serving. Service was prompt, food was yummy and the cocktails were great too!
3
The dine in a cup was an interesting dining concept for diners to try out different dishes at one go. However, the taste was not very up to standard. Dishes was cold and portion was very small.
3
Food after discount a bit expensive,but the atmosphere not bad for dining at nice place.Hope there will be more promotion.
5
My wife love the ambience and I like the food. Perfecto.
We found the place by chance and have been going back since. Wish to try the painting session there one day
4
The dining experience although imperfect was one of my best. The variety and quality of cuisine offered was spot on with an above average chef. Presentation was festive, with the ornate trays and see through double glazed bowls. Service was attentive and prompt. Although the varied seating arrangements were fun to behold, only some offer a modicum of comfort a normal table does. That being said, the experience of seating at some of these unconventional tables was enjoyable in other ways. Because the restaurant services expatriates (who live close by), you may find the odd family with children in tow, who decidedly treat it as a beach hut. Half naked with no shoes, they create a ruckus as they run around. The staff can do little as these folk are probably loyal regulars. I'll return for the good food and service, and bear with other less than thoughtful diners
3
I'm writing this for the hope that they will listen. I'm a regular, I like the food and ambiance, and also the service. But beginning last year and that had continued this week, nobody is answering the phone. Your restaurant is far and it is a risk to just show up without reservation or anyone to talk to to confirm. You used to pick up the phone to attend to enquiries. What happened to the crew? If you cannot be reached or you'll never pick up, perhaps inform in anyway through your website so that we will stop trying To call and sadly, skip going to your restaurant.
4
Nice place for a different dining experience. The futton style seating is fun, although demanding for legs.Food varied from good to very good, always creatively plated. The music background was nice and modern too. Location is a bit remote but sometimes it is also good to feel that you get away. Service was very polite but lacking in consistency from one person to another. Extra points for the colourable table mats
4
I went with a group of family and friends to Museo on Sentosa. We had some difficulty finding the restaurant as it was upstairs, but once settled we had a pleasant evening. The food in tapas-type servings came in attractive glass bowls. Everyone enjoyed their meals with the pork belly and lavender prawns being the standout dishes. Service was good apart from a couple of hiccups when a drink or dish didn't arrive but this was soon rectified.Restaurants at Sentosa Cove are all quite expensive but this was good value, unlike some which charge a lot but don't really deliver
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday a few months back at Museo. Food was good and the ambience was great! Prices were relatively affordable for the quality of food and that it was a restaurant located in Sentosa. One would immediately assume that Sentosa restaurants were expensive! Anyway the staff that served us were really sweet and knew that it was a birthday dinner. However, they thought that it was planned by my wife for me and sang me the birthday song instead! got a complimentary cake too! Will return soon
4
A set menus for 2 is reasonable. You can enjoy 8 dishes, ,salada, 2 vegetable dishes, 2 seafood dishes ,2 meat dishes and desert All Singapore cuisine were tasty. This casual restaurant is highly reccommended for those who want to enjoy a meal with friends or family
5
It was my second visit to museo, this time for dinner to celebrate my birthday, and Museo nailed it again! Impeccable service, great food, great ambience. Would highly recommend Museo to anyone looking for a charming spot for occasion dining.
3
The portion for the food was very small, which kinda forces you to order more. I ordered the cod fish for my mains and the fish was not fresh.
5
This is a cool place for team bonding as you can paint whilst you are eating. The food especially the starter was nice too, I like the satay, salted egg calamari and fried cheese.
4
Cute glass bowls of tapas alike dishes. Cool concept. Comfortable seating. Choc dessert ball was a disappointment but all else we ordered was very tasty.
5
We did not know what to expect. We are very happy - great food, nice people. A bit too cold for my wife, but fine by me.
4
Comes in small portion exactly like the menu online. Quite filling by the time we are at the last few dish.
5
Restaurant was less than half filled at 7+ during Friday evening. Went on recommendation and service was top notch. Friendly and helpful. Need no reminder to refill water and clearly explained their food and dining concept though only 2 wait staffs were seen running whole show. Kudos.Food creation in a bowl as appetisers, soups, mains and desserts were intriguing enough and tasted wonderful.Overall good experience
5
I love the concept of small bowls and the extensive options this restaurant offers. We had the $109 menu which gives us 8 options to share so you get to eat a bit of everything. I also like the flexibility, we didn't like one of the options on the selections and could swap it for an extra $2. Food is delicious and the servers are friendly. We'll be bac
5
This is definitely an unique dining experience where great delicate design n presentation is planned in the food served. It is located within Sentosa Cove where the yachts dock. That is a great place to watch sunset literally. This place is accessible by car and taxi. There is also a Cold Storage there. It will be and is the gem of Sentosa. This place will become crowded and popular very soon. The restaurant wait staff is generally polite and efficient in their service. Take a look at the appetizing food photos taken.
5
Just loved the quality of the service amd the kind waiters. They explained eveything very well to us.We to the 8 cours bowl menu so we had a tast of all and really enjoid how this was served and the quality of the food.Recomand to have a desert as well 
5
It's my 3rd time patronising the restaurant. My hubby and I enjoyed the dinner and love the restaurant ambience and not forgetting the service rendered by the staff. Will continue to patronise again!
5
The food was great. I would recommend to try out their lavender prawns, satay and their lamb rack. The servers are great and responsive. I would definitely come again to this restaurant again for dinner.

Visited on a Sunday night. It was quiet, good for a romantic night. In fact if that's what you are planning, you should call ahead and reserve one of the tatami-style tables for your meal. There are also lounging chairs and the normal height upright seating dining table arrangements to choose from.Service was friendly and attentive enough.Quality of food was a little inconsistent. Being huge risotto aficionados, my husband and I ordered the Truffle Mushroom Risotto with Hokkaido Scallop, and the Pan Roasted Cod Fillet which also came with a portion of truffle mushroom Risotto, plus a small baked scallop. The cod was delicious, and the scallop not bad too, but the portion of risotto that came with the cod was dry, lukewarm, and lacking in taste. It was very different from main dish of truffle mushroom risotto, which wasn't the best we've ever had, but was at least soft and juicy and tasty. The Hokkaido scallops that came with the risotto dish was pretty rubbery though. When we asked about the stark contrast in the quality of the risottos, we were told that the risotto as a main dish was prepared fresh, whereas the risotto as a side of the cod was pre-prepared. So essentially, we are paying more that $35++ for a piece of delicious cod + small baked scallop, and another $36++ for a mushroom risotto that usually cost $25++ at other restaurants. I suppose the extra cost went to paying for the tranquil view of sentosa quayside and the swanky surroundings
5
Was there for birthday celebration. Atmosphere was awesome! Totally love the sofa sitting. Its a nice and good place to chill. Food idea was great, for small portion. However, some items are so so ...Had the following: 1) Lobster Bisque (better for sharing)2) Deep Fried Camembert Cheese is Superb for cheese lover like me ! 3) Tuna Tataki - average nth special, had nicer ones 4) Cajun Baby Potatoes - average nth special 5) Crab Meat Aglio Olio - average nth special 6) Cold Pasta - Superb ! with the truffle shavings 7) Soft shell crab (Too oily, nth special) 8) Baby Octopus (Too oily for me and nth special about the salty egg, had nicer ones)9) Pork Belly (A little spicy)10) Vodka Chocolate Lava Cake (Not too sweet, but lack of the vodka flavour) 11) Frozen Pistachio Nougat (Average) Will try other dishes when i'm there next time.
4
My husband brought me here for a birthday celebration meal and it was a quiet and lovely place. Museo is on the second floor of a building and accessibly by stairs or elevator (directly from the carpark).Upon entering the restaurant, I didn't quite like the smell of the leather seats at one side of the restaurant, so we picked chair seats by the window where we could people watch.Service was great when we were the only diners around, but as more couples arrived, the poor single waiter was having a hard time juggling all our needs. Food was delicious, we ordered one of the two lunch sets with 8 courses and enjoyed the tastes. Museo serves Asian fusion cuisine and I like the familiar 'stir fried' style for the angel hair spaghetti. It was also my first time trying fried camembert cheese and it was delightful with fruit jam. :)It's a great place to chill and stuff yourself
5
A great place for chilling out with friends or family at this restaurant with nice artistic ambience. Good mezzanine food and the lobster bisque is rich and really excellent (best ever try although price may be a bit steep). Service personnel was patient and helpful. We were even offered a FOC drink for kid and extra portion of appetizer even though we did not request for it. It just make my day great and relax! This is definitely one of the better restaurant in Sentosa Cove
5
Wanted to head there for my son's birthday and was completely amazed. Love the array of food that was served to us and the thought that was put into each dish. Thank you to the team for accommodating our dog and making allowances for the dinner to happen. We will be back soon
5
Had an awesome evening with family at Museo last weekend. Ambience was pretty cosy with the living duo band serenading diners with both classics and contemporary hits. Service was excellent. Staff werre warm and attentive. Food was excellent especially for the dinner sets comprising of a selection of their most popular dishes...all served in their unique style of "dinner in a bowl". Sizes may seem small at first glance but trust me it definitely makes up in flavour. Overall a 10/10. Will definitely be back again
5
Celebrated dad's 60th birthday there last night with my family and we had a most enjoyable time there! As per recommendation of the staff, we got a taster set and a couple of entrÃ©es to share and the quantity of food was just right! Enjoyed the food, as I have each time I've been there! And most of all, really appreciated how they made my dad's birthday a special one by getting the live band to sing him a birthday song - which they did in all 4 national languages! The wait staff and restaurant manager were all very professional and quick to respond to our requests - even thinking quickly on their feet when my dad seemed to notice my mom slipping the manager a note to get the band to sing a birthday song, and pretending to clear our table of all the stray papers. We had a good laugh over it afterwards! All in all, my family truly had an enjoyable time there and will definitely consider going back to celebrate special occasions there in future!:
4
Museo definitely lives up to its name - it was indeed a museum of exquisite art pieces, whether it was the cutlery, the decor or even the food. The food was nicely presented in their unique glass jars with great food quality. Choices were also aplenty and I highly recommend their mezzanine choices. My favourites were the lavendar prawns and squid ink risotto - although I have to say that their cheesecake in chocolate soil was delicately presented in the glass jars.
4
Nice Ambience & Delicious Savory Treat!! Love their Lychee Tea and most impt a cooling place for a chatting session
4
Excellent service, great atmosphere. Went as a couple and only managed to try 4 dishes - would recommend going in a larger group!
4
Service and staff was excellent . Passion on their job and went an extra mile . Atmosphere was good . Good place for bonding but need to add more selection of food for main course
5
Came here to celebrate birthday for my girlfriend, we had a blast, excellent service and excellent food, decent ambience.
5
The ambience of the place is awesome. Inspiring place
Second time coming to the restaurant. Highly recommended
5
It's my first time to Museo, I love the ambience. It's very cozy. For the food selection, I'm spoilt with the choices! Service crews were very friendly and nice! Will definitely be there again with my friends!
4
Food were tasty and creative, ambiance Was perfectly set as we have a bay view. Staffs were polite and efficient.
5
The bride squad was 9 people strong and we definitely took sometime to understand the menu and take our picks - we were using our Entertainer app and had to figure out what comes under the deal. Museo has an interesting dining-in-a-cup concept. All dishes are served in bowls and so you have a little bit of everything. Top picks: Lavender Prawns, Crab Meat Aglio Oglio Pasta and Deep Fried Camembert Cheese. The staff and especially the manager, Yugen, were very friendly and patient. One our dishes were unavailable and he did some mix and match to make up for the loss. You may consider these standard service but he made it his duty to ensure the bride had a fantastic time. He made us special shots on the house and surprised us! Throughout our dinner, he would check up on us and engaged in small talk that didn't sound scripted. Despite us being the last ones there and having a great time, they didn't rush us or chase us out lol. We had a great time celebrating a special day for our dear friend. Definitely going back and that too in a big group to try more dishes
4
This is a nice restaurant for a date, it is away from the city and has a great view. You can do some painting after the dinner which is what makes it different from other places. There are some seats that you are actually lying on the sofa and that is quite nice as well. Price wise, it is about 120-150 for a couple and probably not crowded as it is not easy to go to Sentosa and to the cove side. Enjo
4
Swung by for our dinner reservation and no one served us at the door. Sat ourselves down and waited a good 15 minutes and there was still no menus on our table. Staff claimed that they were busy after making a complain but visibly, the restaurant was empty. The manager intervened and to cut it short, made a rly good recovery. Kudos to the manager. p/s food was awesome but...... the portion could do with a little bit more justice.
5
Fusion & artistic style restaurant delivers good service & great impressive foods.
Highlights: Roast Pork Belly, Cod Fillet & Yuzu Gelato.
Art Jam is funtastic!
5
This restaurants exudes the right vide for a casual romantic evening with a loved one. Easy music and friendly staff attending to guests.
Food was really impressive - especially the Mezzanine Pork dish and the Pork Cheek Mains!
4
we had the signature platter (4items) and ice lychee and ice pear tea! awesome food and people. if you have time you should go for the art jamming.
4
Good atmosphere, nice scenery, food is not bad but portion too small. A very relax place. Went there with my hubby and son. My son enjoyed himself alot.
5
We went to Museo couple of weeks ago and really enjoyed it, My son loves the seats, great very friendly staff.
1
receive email confirmation for booking and ended up restaurant saying that there was no such booking! bad attitude and customer service from the restaurant manager
4
Foods great and the staff too. The selections for the 5-course dinner are well-thought of. Food presentations great too.
But i wished that the food be serve a bit faster than the usual , the phasing is too slow.
5
Food is yummy and pretty with quirky and interesting choices in the menu...The place feel very private. Staff is very helpful. Very artistic place and it comes with an area for us to paint. They prepared the canvas and bottomless paint. Additional fees for this but you can paint while waiting for the food and after eating. Amazing and inspiring
4
This is my 2nd visits to the restaurant and I would say that I'm still happy with their food quality and services. Even thou portion is small but with good quality which is important. Although it's a bit difficult to get there but the ambience or surrounding is a nice place to chill if that's what you are looking for. Take a look at the 4 or 5 court set menu, value for money! My son had the spaghetti meatball for kids meal, the portion was not small either. In general, the food is good, service is good except that they don't serve ice water =)
2
Very disappointed with the seating I receive whereby I booked 2 week in advance for Valentine day, I was told by the staff that if the sofa customer didn't show up I would get the sofa seat, but in the end no other customer show up, Paid $339 for Valentine day dinner + 1.5hour painting session, the food was ok but not really full at all. Atmosphere was perfec
2
Restaurant staff did not know about online reservation. My request for a slice of bday cake not received.
4
Great Food, Enjoyed every single of it and great selection of teas as well. Great ambience.. Except that some of the staffs were rude in the way they treat the customers
5
Relaxed and romantic setting recommended for dating couples. Food was awesome and the crew provided service readily at all times. Great place to dine!
5
Museo serves fusion cuisines and the plating of each dish is interesting and fun to behold. The quality of the food is also high and i would highly recommend anyone to give this restaurant a try.
4
I like Museo very much as it offers cozy and romantic ambiance, it is unique because it enables guests to enjoy painting on canvas with all equipment provided ($40/or $20 if the dinning bill exceeded $40). It offers 4 or 5-course set menu with a wide selection of dishes to choose, guests can share the set-menu meals and order additional main dishes. I went there with a few friends for a birthday dinner, it was quiet on Sat, but think it was still a good choice for Sentosa. I chose the 4-course set menu for dinner - the food was delicious, the portion was good, great value for money, and the dishes were served with lovely presentation. The staff members were friendly and provided good service. It exceeded my expectations, I will go back if I choose to dine in Sentosa again.

Was looking for a unique restaurant space close to the marina on Sentosa to bring my parents who are visiting from overseas for their wedding anniversary. Was originally attracted by the restaurant design and broad menu which would satisfy any picky eaters though was somewhat concerned by some of the reviews here and other sites. To ensure no issues with reservations I called and booked the table. We arrived a bit early and the team was able to adjust our seating as we weren't able to sit in the lounging-type table. Good start. 3 of our 4 ordered the 4 course menu (highly recommended) and we notified the server of the cadence of the courses that would fit us best to ensure no uncertain expectations. This is recommended for any course meal as some prefer a longer pause between courses and others less. First course: 2 orders of pork belly and 1 chicken satay. Everyone very happy. Pork belt was super and much larger portion than expected. Satay also nice. 2nd course: All 3 ordered the Wagyu. Again, fantastic taste and nice portion size. 3rd course: 3 order of the NZ beef. Soooo good. Too much for Mom to finish hers so I helped out willingly. 1 order of cod also very satisfied. Dessert: 3 cheesecake and 1 lava cake. On top of scrumptious dessert the team went the extra mile by acknowledging my parents anniversary with a bit of special writing on the dessert plate. They also provided a taster of strawberry pattacotta. Wow. This would be an amazing dessert by itself. Only pictures are dessert as too busy eating the other courses! Motif inside is interesting. I didn't hear anything to understand the overall concept but entering through the back door there is a small art workshop and other easels etc. throughout. We only noticed the surroundings briefly on arrival as after the food arrived we were entirely focused on our experience. We had no issues with staff attentiveness as we were the first customers of the day which was other previous issues for reviewers. That being said on leaving when more if a crowd was forming we did receive acknowledgment from the open-kitchen staff and our server again wished my parents a happy anniversary. Nicely acknowledged. Lots of nice touches, superb food, and a unique environment. Exactly what I was looking for and my parents said they couldn't think of anything that could have been better. PERFECT

We went to Museo because we wanted to try a restaurant Quayside and friends had recommended it. Spacious, post industrial style decor, with a little bit of art deco thrown in for good measure. Feeling at once lush and then austere, the menu was limited but with enough options to satisfy most people, except diehard vegetarians. Wine list was also limited but with high quality, mid range price. We shared a bottle of excellent French Pinot Noir. We chose a 5 course menu. First course was lobster bisque and a salad. The presentation in glass bowls was a nice touch. The salad was fairly plain not living up to the restaurant presentation (a note for them to match what they serve with their style). 2nd course was camembert with cranberry sauce and Pork back ribs. The pork was a little dry, the camembert was fried just nicely. 3rd course was a mushroom truffle risotto with hokkaido scallops and meat for my husband. The risotto was absolutely perfect, and my husband enjoyed the meat immensely. I think he overdid the meat component of his 5 courses, so his dessert was gelato. My dessert was as whimsical and stylish as the restaurant. A piece of pistachio nougat ice cream inside a chocolate ball, sitting on a bed of chocolate dirt. As I poured the caramel sauce over the chocolate orb, it hissed and melted to reveal the ice cream.. Delicious. All this for under $300, less for cash. This is a great place to take someone to see Sentosa Quayside and experience a unique restaurant dining experience.

I am deeply disappointed by the service level of such a well known restaurant. I booked via CHOPE apps days ago a table for two for my birthday on 14 November. On 13 nov, museo staff called me at 515pm that due to technical issue with their website and apps, I was not supposed to get my table. The staff apologized and requested me to book another time. Does he expect me to book next year ? I requested for the manager to call me back but till today, no response. Very disappointing service level. Thanks to this close door, my boyfriend and I went to their neighbour next door where I spent a memorable birthday dinner with excellent food and service. You should settle your technical issue instead of compromising your customer satisfaction.
2
Ordered 2 way lobster and the texture was like beef, either it wasn't fresh or it was wayyyy overcooked. Lobster bisque was decent but for the price, I was expecting some bits of lobster in it. Nothing to complain about the ambience, nice scenery, definitely a nice place to spend the evening
5
We came across this restaurant by chance as we were staying at the W hotel.What a find, great food, excellent service and relaxing atmosphere.We had a 4 course menu, every course had a little innovative twist, very tasty and very well presented.We will definitely be visiting gain
4
the only bad thing about it is that it's at the end of Sentosa.
Should have another outlet in town.
Love the 4 course meal.
Didn't try the cocktails.

Had a lovely wedding dinner. Service was good and ambience / food was great. A great place to chill with family and friends.

The staff were really nice people and so was the food! Bus 3 from Beach Station takes really long, pfft, but this is irrelevant.
Bed seats are comfy.

Thank you to the team at Museo for our anniversary dinner!
For the price we paid, the food quantity was more than fair enough, not to mention quality was much exceeding our expectations.,

This is the 3rd time I've dined in Museo. All 3 times have been an excellent experience. Although the average price per person is about S$70-S$90 without wine. The fine dining experience is filling enough if you go for the 4 course dinner at $68++ per head. One can order 2 different set menu for sharing in order to enjoy a gamut of fabulous food. Kronenbourg Blanc 1664 going at $13++ was exceptionally refreshing if you get the staff to freeze it. The top layer of beer settles into a thin layer of crisp ice each time you take a sip. What a refreshing taste! The molten chocolate is a must-try! Artists wannabe can hone their talents by working on their masterpiece on the easel & canvas provided for diners. Sylvia, a part-time service personnel there has been most helpful and patient in explaining and recommending the most popular chef's speciality. Thanks Sylvia! You've made the experience another great one that will keep me coming back for more ...

Very slow service. We have to chase from one course to another course throughout our dinner. Waited even more than 40 minutes from one course to another. Food was average. Not even enjoy in the later part of dinner as we just wanted to end the dinner rather to enjoy the food

Dinner was fantastic. The portion was just enough for both me and my girlfriend which was good thing since my girlfriend did not eat much. The ambiance was nice with a nice view of the evening. Service was excellent and waiter/waitress were polite and friendly. Would recommend couples to go there for dinner

We were a group of 16 and had a private area. Mogan, our main point of contact, was most wonderful. The food was varied enough and thoughtfully done. Wines we had were of great quality (with good recommendation from Mogan).Overall great place for group dining

Friends in Singapore said that they had heard good things about Museo.It was disappointing in many ways.The service was very wooden and in many ways roboticThe portions were minuscule and the prices were high.Both the wines we wanted had been "sold out" that morningDuring the meal one of our guests requested for more of the wafers/chipsThe waiter looked quite stricken and finally said that they do not give more!Worth a miss as the other restaurants close by have far better foo

Food is at a very reasonable price.
Portion is well served.
Food is tasty.
Ambience is good.
Service on some of the staff needs some impovement.
In all, deserves 5/5 stars.

It's a wonderful night to remember. Nice food, good service & the best ambiance. Me & my husband really enjoyed the night.

Full height glass walls provided great view to patrons on the One degree 15 yacht club. However, it's really warm beyond comfort for "chilling" during day time.

Food was Tremendous! Atmosphere is romantic/chic and they have a painting area where you can go and create a work of art. Really cool spot on Sentosa Island.

I was here to try their chocolate lava cake, after hearing rave reviews about it online by a very influential Singaporean food blogger whom I shall not name. Suffice to say, I am very disappointed and am certain that the said food blogger was probably paid off by this restaurant to say nice things about it, since this restaurant is a letdown in every way possible. I arrived around 8.30pm on a saturday night with no reservation, and the place was half empty. However, I had to wait outside for 10 minutes as they sorted everything out, and the waiter looked genuinely surprised that someone would have the audacity to visit without, gasp, making a reservation. The ambience was not bad, but the furnishings were tacky, in an obvious attempt to look "artsy" and "new age". The music being played were old Maroon 5 songs (instead of something more suitable like smooth jazz), which made the whole place seem a lot less classy. The tables were 100% clear glass, which is a bad idea as you can see your feet beneath very clearly as you eat.The service was atrociously bad, and I had to request for the menu several times to different waiters before finally getting my hands on one. The waiters clearly looked super busy, but the place was only half full, which says something about the efficiency of this restaurant. I was also not offered any water until 20 minutes in, despite my multiple requests.I ordered the chocolate lava cake, and a chocolate ice cream for my brother. The food took more than 45 minutes to arrive. And the worst part is, they got the order wrong and assumed that I wanted a chocolate ice cream ON TOP of my chocolate lava cake. Seriously, who in the right mind would order a chocolate lava cake paired with chocolate ice cream?! The waiter was unapologetic, and I had to order another chocolate ice cream again separately. Apart from the order mix-up, the food was also subpar. The chocolate ice cream tasted like the crappy supermarket type (I'm sure you know what I mean), and yet costs $6 for a tiny scoop. The chocolate lava cake was ridiculously small, and was probably overcooked as the outside was way too crisp and the insides didn't really flow out. We asked for the bill, which took another 20 minutes to arrive. The service was truly awful, and if they can't even handle the restaurant when it is half full, I shudder to imagine what happens when it hits full capacity. (Then again, I doubt it'll ever hit full capacity, given how bad the service is and how pathetic the food is)The location of this restaurant is actually quite good, as it overlooks the boats. However, this is truly wasted on such a terrible restaurant that has to resort to paying/bribing food bloggers to bring in unsuspecting customers. There are a lot of better restaurants in Sentosa Cove, so do not make the horrible mistake of going to this one

We did not get the corner table we were promised, but staff agreed to comp us on our first glasses of house wine, which were good. The prix fixe menu is a relative bargain in this area. Quality and service were very good but not exceptional. Nice view of marina

Very good ingredients and well cooked, but the staff need more training. Best value wine we have seen in Singapore. Tables are really silly, like glass coffee tables. Their prime view tables are japanese style - you would be laying down! Horrible cheap little napkins and lots of silly designed plates and cutlery holders. With a great view it would help if they cleaned the windows

Amazing food BUT service was very poor. Waiters looking on their smart phones instead of taking care of the customers. We were waiting quite a while just to get our hands on the menus. If you want to have their 4-course menu, don't book a table after 9pm - the kitchen closes! When leaving, the waitress did not respond to us saying bye. The toilets are also outside. The ambiance is nice, pleasant and quite romantic. Given the price range and the inconvenient location coupled with the poor service, I need to give a poor rating overall

After reading great reviews on this place we decided to give it a go for a romantic dinner.I made a reservation some time in advance, a few weeks, but when we arrived they had no knowledge of our reservation. Even though I showed the girl our booking confirmation email on my phone, they seemed to be confused and unwilling. I don't know why it seemed such a problem, especially as the restaurant was half empty. The girl had to go and get a man and then they 'managed to fit us in'. We were shown to a table with a view of a plain black wall and made our order. We decided on the 4 course set meal, which costs $68++ and some cocktails. We waited until 2nd course to receive our drinks and were not offered any water for the table, although other tables noticeably were. When our first plate was cleared the waiter took our used dirty cutlery off our plates and then put them on our table (not on a serviette) for us to use again on our next course, disgusting. We couldn't understand this at all.I have read that the atmosphere is very romantic at Museo and I have to say it certainly wasn't unfortunately. It was freezing in there and the service from all was consistently bad throughout the meal so we found it difficult to enjoy ourselves. The music was also very quiet so you heard everything people said on the opposing tables. We would definitely not return.It is such a shame as the food itself was actually, in the main very tasty. The chicken cordon bleu was enormous and far too much for one person to eat, but good quality and delicious breadcrumbs, The cheesecake wasn't too my taste, it tasted like a big chunk of cheese and wasn't very appetising. The chocolate lava desert was extremely good. All in all, I felt the place had so much promise, a stunning location at Sentosa Cove and nice interior but the staff really let it down for us

Read up on quite a fair number of excellant reviews and decided to give it a shot. Location wise, its opposite W hotel, at the Quayside isle. A bit remote, but indeed, away from the city life. It wasn't packed, perhaps due to its location. But i must say that the experience was well worth it. For starters, The pork belly was so flavorful and the soft shell crab was one of the best that i have had. The mains paled in comparison to the starters. Pork steak was ok, bit tough. Beef steak was decent. For desserts, my lava cake was a bit on the dry side. But the ice cream managed to salvage it. The banana creme brulee was interesting and satisfied my craving for sweet stuff. Had a pear tea and it was $16 (a bit on the high side), but it came in a pot. Can be shared thou. It was refreshing. The cocktail was strong and it seems they were generous with the alcohol. At a price tag of $22...Its pretty decent. Overall was $90 for 2 with the restaurant week lunch pricing + drinks (ala carte

i was there for diner with my partner, and it was awesome. the food was great and the ambiance just right. i prefer the normal seating with 4 seater, not the coach seater though. difficult for people who wear pencil skirt.try their scallop entree .. it's super tast

With a marvelous location on the waterfront in Sentosa, Museo has a very relaxed and chilled out atmosphere- think sofa seats, perfect for lounging out on. The concept of a bar/ high-tea salon is very original and gave us a hugely varied amount of options when it came to eating and drinking. We found it a perfect afternoon escape from the city

When we first came upstairs to this restaurant, we thought it'll be an expensive place. But looking at the menu, the prices are actually reasonable.We loved the bed seats....felt like you are home! Haha.The food portions were very generous and tasted good too. The service staff were also friendly and helpful...but giving you privacy. We were very impressed.Will definitely return! Oh, the satay and drinks were awesome. Truly surprised find

It has a nice view from the main dinning area. Also has an option to do some art work if you wish to. Basically painting. Kinda open kitchen type, service was slow. unfortunately, there was only one person serving. Will i go back? There are other places around the area.

My company organised a dinner event at Museo few weeks back, thought I would leave my fair share of review.This wonderful creation is tucked neatly at Quayside Isle, next to W Hotel.At first sight, I thought that the concept was really unique and artistic - the lighting, the seating area, the bar area.. all blended so well within the 4 walls - an excellent combination of a luxury high tea salon and a sleek bar with (casual) fine dining option (top notch indeed).The food was flavourful and delectable - plenty of selection for fine dining. Price is on a bit of a high side but for good quality fine dining under such an ambiance - can't really complain much (The saying goes: you get what you pay for). I recommend the red snapper and the Australian Beef Steak (absolutely delicious!)I had a great time and would definitely come back again to try the Art Jamming

Was here for dinner nice place to hang out. But they had really nasty neighbors. Was there for dinner and their neighbors was shouting at the service lad

For pictures and full reviews, visit my website at ms-skinnyfatQuayside Isle on Sentosa Island is fast becoming the chill out spot for the young and fabulous. Sunset dining in the plush and luxurious setting, with a magnificent view of the marina littered with beautiful yachts; it is easy to think that you are on holiday. I recently checked out MUSEO, the sister restaurant of Arteastiq Boutique Tea House.The vantage point over the marina allows you to people watch from your comfortable sofa seats. I found them rather perfect for hanging out with friends. A good way to sample the various dishes is to customize your own Mezzanine set which allows you a choice of 4 dishes for only $39. Ignoring the pretentious names which are rather irrelevant to the food, the quality is actually not bad. In fact, i thought these were better than the main courses.My favorite was the Deep fried prawns flavored with lavender. Juicy tempura prawn drizzled with sweet lavender mayo. The texture of the mayo was a bit like the tze char style but it had a light lavender perfume to it. Very delicious. The crispy but tender Smoked Roast Pork Belly also has our votes. The pepper crusted Tuna Tataki was rather refreshing with a tangy vinaigrette. The Soft Shell Chilli Crab packed a punch with the tomato based chili sauce with a hint of sambal in it.The baked River Prawns and Linguine ($28) was saved by the well flavored aglio olio pasta that was citrusy and savory. The baked prawns didn't gel too well with the cheese and herbs and the meat was also on the dry side.The Two-way Lamb ($35) and the Beef Short Ribs were meh.We ordered 3 desserts for sampling and each came with a choice of ice cream. The Green tea brûlée ($12) was obviously not given the TLC that it deserved. The golden caramel top was absent! Instead we had semi melted sugar granules sitting on top a curd that was too dense and gelatinous. The dessert that takes the cake goes to the Vodka Chocolate Lava Cake ($12). Not that the vodka taste was particularly strong but we liked the light bitterness that was brought out in the molten centre.Hits and misses at this one but if you just stick to the Mezzanine and end with tea and desserts, you should have a rather enjoyable date

Pricey, service was terrible, had to stand up to get waiter at 2pm in the afternoon when we were one out of two tables occupied in the whole place. Food servings were tiny and cold and if you are at the website the pictures of the food is bigger than the actual dish. Our mains were terrible and I took couple of bites and left my dish 10% eaten. No questions asked by the service staff and we left as soon as we could. Utterly turned off by the place and ended eating at a nicer place next door

Wanted to do painting and was looking forward to it. But upon seated, everything seem wrong. Chair were not clean, service wasnt prompt. Pork chops were extremely salty and fish was stale. The whole of the fish dish actually looked like it was leftovers from the day before. Portion and taste was ridiculous for the price - Its not even a Michelin starred restaurant?! We were so turned off at the end of the meal, we couldnt finish the terrible food, we left without painting. Who knows what could happen

Great location, excellent ambience, nice wines and great starters with a twist. Was a perfect evening, until we ordered our entrees. Then it was all downhill. After waiting for 40 odd minutes, check with the server who returns with " the chef forgot your orders and has left". I KID YOU NOT. The chef FORGOT and has LEFT THE HOUSE. Incredulous, we ask to speak with the manager, who ambles over in a non hurried pace with a matter of fact ' the server forgot to key in your order and yes the chef has left and there is nothing we can offer you. That's it. No apologies, no here is what we can do to make it up for you....that's that !This place has all the right ingredients to to make it an outstanding venue...except the most important factor...SERVICE
