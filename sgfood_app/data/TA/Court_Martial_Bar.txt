New little eatery in close proximity to the Marriott development on Beach Road, inside bar area and some tables on the outside on the undercover walkway. Good cocktails and wines and beer, cheese plates etc..Serve mainly finger food , very good calamari rings , buffalo wings, prawns and salads.It was late when we arrived , after 11.00pm ,but were happy to give us great food and service staff were a pleasure. Came back a second time but the venue was doing a private function so went to one of their sister restaurants just along the walkway , Beach Caf√©.

Had to come to the CMB as the Media Bar was closed. A lovely and quiet bar in the middle of the day, a great place to have a nice read and chill out before the maelstrom of the night.

I have visited the Court Martial bar at JW Marriott South Beach on several occasions and the service never disappoints. Staff are attentive and friendly - if you are counting on a place to unwind after a long day's work that will be sure to be reliable - you can trust that the Court Martial bar will be a choice location

Great place to have a few drinks with your friends and try delicious snacks ! Service was great , lovely lady Kini guide us through menu and helped us choose very nice cocktails.

Me and my friend enjoyed a lot and we will definitely come back to JW Marriott after the first fabulous impression from Narvin! Thank you again

Lovely cosy, stylish place with great service and great kia royale. The food was great but late so they gave us free drinks without asking always a good sign. Very nice place, great for after work drinks

Having recently spent a couple of hours in the Court Matial Bar - I can say it was a pleasant experience. Apart from the one of one deal, sitting at the window watching the world go by was very enjoyable. The barman was very pleasnt and helpful - a nice guy

After stopping at Vatos for an average Tex-Korean dinner with 1 beer & 1margarita later, I spotted this bar next door. Empty & tucked into an obscure corner, something lured me in. The sole bartender on duty invited me in and I tried the South Beach Sour. As the usual whiskey drinker who likes her Manhattans and Vieux Carres , this whiskey sour is very updated and fresh, with the Boudreaux giving it a nice twist. Further conversation suggests there will be a revamp of the cocktail menu. With the polish of today's drink, I eagerly anticipate their new creations. Highly recommended

Had a Monkey 47 night with my colleagues. Fantastic location for networking and a chill out session. Food offered are pretty decent and it compliments the beverages and cocktails

My friends and i were regulars at 28HK. In an adventurous mood, we decided why not take a look around SG cocktail bar scene for a place in comparable to our usual hunt for a fresh experience! One of my friends heard great comments about court martial bar and we were like, let's go! We spend a fair bit of time searching for the location but with directions we found it!Imagine the moment we step foot into the bar, The ambience, the candlelights, the upbeat metropolitan music, the chic mix sophisticated bar concept took our breath away.. this place is amazing!Approaching us was Navin who was the bar manager. He did a round of sharing what are his signature drinks and i would say this is an brillant idea to have re-invented classics with a twist of local flavour!After rounds of yummy cocktails like South Beach Sour, Heritage Sling, Chocolate Martini, barrel-aged Godfather and Negroni, we were in a game mood for a challenge! We challenge Navin for a bespoke drink for each of us to end the fabulous night on a high! Asking for our preference and our palate, Navin started crafting his art and working his magic.. Wala! Our drinks came and they were by far the best we ever had with taste that smoothe our palates, hitting the right spots! Great job!!!Awesome place! Awesome drinks! Awesome service! We are now converters and this will be our new hunt! See you soon

Classic cocktail but also special creations, so some new stuff to try. Staff is nice and service good. The space is nice and we loved the archeological type of garage bench below the floor glass floor. A bit of history..

Was walking around Beach Road and came across this bar. They had fantastic happy hour offers. The golden squid is a must try..

Upon arriving Singapore, my local friends told me about this new hotel - JW Marriott South Beach. After settling down in our hotel, me and my friends went to JW Marriott South Beach to check out the new hotel. We dropped by Court Martial Bar to have a few drinks before having dinner and we were greeted by Navin Raj, the mixologist of Court Martial Bar. He assured us that they had the "best Negroni in Singapore" - and yes, we were really happy about the drinks there! We also tried the "Heritage Sling", "Whisky Sour" and many other cocktails. We were so happy about the place and the service, we went back three more times til we left Singapore.It's great to know that there are so many nice places for Cocktails in Singapore and Court Martial Bar is really one of the best ones out there! I can't wait to be back

Been here a couple of times and totally love this place and vibe. Great bar food to go with the 1-for-1 drinks. Shout out to Navin, the bar manager for the Super service and great cocktails. Will be back for more.

The ambience totally changed when they start to downplay with the lightings at the bar (from 6pm). It's a great place to have a glass of wine, cocktails and they have a good selection of whisky. Must try bar snacks, Golden Squid & Wagyu Skewers!Service is great, they are very attentive to your needs. Definitely a place to bring your date to build good impression

Along the beach road we found Court Martial Bar, decided to have a drink. The margarita were served with black salt which surprisingly makes a difference to the classic cocktail. The design of the bar is what catches my eye, there's an litted engineering car pit that was built decades ago. Will definitely visit the court martial again
5
Initially planned to go for one drink but ended up staying throughout the night! Great ambiance! Good music. Cool/unique cocktails and attractive selection of liquors. Friendly ambiance, staff members were extremely attentive especially our bartender, Navin. We enjoyed his company-- he took initiative to converse and and asked us for refills before our drinks ran out! Would highly recommend this place as a pregame spot!

Found this tucked-away bar after eating at the nearby Armoury, and after a concert. Perfect for drinks, hanging out and chatting. Enjoyed the ambience, music and service. Appreciate that Navin and crew took care of us, especially with one of our friends having a birthday. Enjoyed the generous wine pours and cocktails/shots served up.
5
Went to check out the 1-for-1 happy hour (beer, house spirits, house pours; 5-10pm) with friends. Our highlight of the evening was two dozens of freshly shucked Fine de Claire oysters ($48++ per dozen)!
5
Love the ambience and attentive bar service. Strong drinks! This is one of my regular hang out places!

Went with friends. Best service and very friendly staff especially Navin who showed exceptional care and passion for his work.
Will definitely come back!

Went on a Friday night and kinda busy but the staff were friendly and helpful. for the effort.Simply a stunning bar that stands out in the South Beach Avenue along Beach Road. Happy Hour is from 5PM-9PM daily. Drinks are as cheap as $14++ for 2 glass of hard liquor, wines and beer
5
I decided to make a visit to the JW Marriott and check out it's Food and Beverage offerings. Court Martial Bar the signature Bar of the JW Marriott which is managed by Navin didn't fail to impress. Pricing with fairly reasonable for a luxury hotel. The bucket list for food fantastic. Definitely coming back here again

Credit has to be given when it is due. Have visited this place 3 times and i have to say the excellent service is consistent with the standards of the JW Marriott brand.The team led by Navin are the guys you want to have taking care of you when you need to whisk away a long day at the office.Atmosphere makes the place perfect to wind down the end of the week.Cheers guys and will be seeing you sooner than you think.
