Good food, the place was packed when we arrived, it took a while for our orders to come out but overall it was great. I had the burrata cheese combine with wine. Pasta and pizza was like Rome and the calamares was okay.

The food was awesome, lamb rack was done perfectly. Portebello was very flavorful. Very quiet place and casual style.

Within walking distance (less than1 km) from hillview mrt, this hidden gem is worth trying. The ambience is cozy and you're expected to welcome by very friendly host. The truffle pasta is highly recommended.

Try the truffle pasta and that was simply the best.
The lava cake melts in your mouth and the Tiramisu feels light highly recommended.

I ask the owner why don’t they serve cacio e pepe on a regular basis since they did name the restaurant after it....the owner said cos the locals are not familiar with this type of pasta They did serve cacio e pepe as a special and I was lucky enough to try it... it was an excellent version and reminded me of Roma Sparita where I fell in love with cacio e pepe. It may be on the pricey side in singapore for a cheese-pepper pasta serve in a parmigiana bowl but heh it brings me back to Rome.. it’s simple and divine

Second time here. First time was good but that was several years ago.This time, in Dec 2016, it was a disaster. Not sure whether the chef was away but from what the lady owner said, it didn't seem to be the case. The pastas including the Vongole, were overwhelmed by chilli padi so much so that we couldn't taste anything else! They ought to ask customers before adding chilli padi to their dishes. It was supposed to be a celebratory dinner but easily the worst restaurant meal I've had in a long time

First time and we ordered appetizers, pastas and a pizza. Food arrived fresh and hot. Serving size was reasonable for the price indicated. The restaurant was packed to the brim and i recommend a reservation to secure a table. Quality of food was nice though it tends to be slightly bland.The highlight was the service as the 2 ladies made everyone comfortable and at home. The ambience is almost like you are dining in the suburbs of an Italian town. Will be back again.

We ordered Burrata, pizza, 2 pasta, risotto, lamb and baked sea bass and 2 soups (pumpkin and mushroom) for a group of 4 adults and 1 child for our dinner. All the dishes were good and delicious. The service homely, comfortable, casual. It costs us about S$279.00 so I would say it is quite expensive as the restaurant is not defined as 'Fine dining', but just based on the quality of food and taste, we will go back again but not for frequent eat-outs but rather for the special occasion only

I have been seeing the restaurant for several years and only recently thought about having a meal here with friends. Reservations is a Must for weekend dinners as it gets really crowded! Pizza was gulped down almost immediately by the kids as they truly loved it. Dessert was also a long wait if the restaurant is crowded

Looking for authentic Italian cuisine specializing in cheese and pepper? Their seafood ingredients are fresh and their cheese dishes are marvelous and nicely matched. Also known for their authentic Italian pizza with their famous pepper. Wonderful spirit and service by their owner and staff.

Nice family restaurant, cozy ambience, good service. My favorite are Calamari Fritti, Portobello and Tagliatelle al Tartufo. Usually packed, best to make a reservation.

Food wise the best Italian place I have come across in Singapore. Wouldn't have thought this was possible here. Try the daily specials, especially when the burrata is on. This mozzarella type cheese with a creamy core on rocket salad and tomatoes just made my day. Many thanks to Jackie and her awesome team.

We shared a beautiful evening with friends at Cacio e Pepe last night. Cacio e Pepe is Hidden away in the quiet suburban Bukit Batok area, Cacio e Pepe strives to create a relaxed yet authentic Italian dining experience. The service was sublime. Gracious, knowledgeable, unobtrusive and more than competent. The menu was tantalising, So hard to make a choice, The luscious Tagliatelle al Tartufo is a homemade pasta covered in truffle cream sauce with scallops and prawns that you should try. We tried and lived all that and more, Plus dessert. We will be back. Thank you for more than a touch of stylish Italian hospitality in Singapore

Had pastas for lunch. Nice and kind owner made our visit very pleasant on top of fine authentic Italian food. Not just pasta itself, seasonings such as Parmesan cheese is very well prepared and kept fresh, which represents the owner's dedication to this business. We love this place!

We go to caccio e pepe frecuently. Simply because the food is good and prices are somehow resonable. They know how to take care well frecuent clients. We always go there and leave satisfied and happy with the food and the service. Menu is extensive and you can find all you would expect in an italian restaurant. Food well prepared however pizzas could be better. The Burrata in this place is the best you can find in Singapore.

My family and I recently visited the eatery as it was recommended by a friend for it's good food and cosy ambience. I always value good recommendations and was very keen to visit. We had made reservations and were pleased when they ushered us to a table indoors.To our dismay, however, our table was just right next to a long table for a group of 30-40 people. We didn't expect a fine dining experience but the noise and behaviour of the party right next to us made us feel as if we were at the hawker centre. Due to the noisy chatter, banter, selfies and group photos, we could hardly have proper conversation throughout the dinner. It was meant to be a family night where we can dine relaxingly and bonding as a family. Alas, that was not meant to be.We ordered the scallops with Parma ham, the clams in white wine, mushroom soup for starters and for mains - the beef tenderloin, seabass, margherita pizza and the squid ink spaghetti. We were told by the hostess that she would serve us the smaller seabass as the big one was meant for 2-3 people. We agreed.Despite the chaos and noise in there, we enjoyed the clams in white wine as there was a twist of chilli in there which gave it a nice finish. The scallops and pizza were also lovely. However, we were left waiting for at least 10 to 15 minutes in between each dish. The squid ink pasta came next - the spaghetti was hard and it felt that the cooling was rushed and not much effort was put into it. We still finished it as we were just hungry. Finally, the hostess checked with us whether we had been served the seabass. We said no and neither had we been served the tenderloin. My boys were already very hungry at that point and was oggling at every dish that passed us by which were served to the neighbouring table.We were then given the news that only the bigger sea bass was available and they would serve us the big one but charge us the lower price meant for the smaller fish. However, it would take another 20 minutes for the fish to be cooked! We declined and she offered to replace it with the parma ham pizza which we agreed readily as my boys were just waiting to be fed!The tenderloin finally arrived and so did the Parma ham pizza which we gobbled up. As the noise was deafening in there and we were worried that it would take another half an hour for the dessert to arrive, we decided to pay and leave without dessert. Very rarely do we leave dinner on a Saturday night without enjoying dessert first. However, we had to given the situation we were in.The hostess was nice enough to offer the second pizza on the house to make up for the mix up with the sea bass. She didn't have to but she did, which was a nice gesture which we appreciated.Overall, it was a very disappointing experience as I had heard good things and read awesome reviews of the place. Perhaps it was just a very busy night and the kitchen could not keep up with the orders. Having the big group right next to us did not help the situation at all, unfortunately. On a different day when it wasn't so busy, perhaps our experience could have been different.

I can't believe I didn't leave a review for my all-time favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore. I've been here numerous times and have never been disappointed. It's definitely worth coming back again and again to try different dishes on the menu. My favourite dish is definitely the vongole spaghetti - generous servings of FRESH clams with strong taste of white wine. Cacio e Pepe is also best known for their pizzas! I am not a big fan of pizzas but it's a different story when I come here for pizzas. The crust are thin and crispy (you have to check out their special oven.)Needless to say, the fabulous food comes with great service

At first we called last minute to book a table for 3 but were told it was fully booked. We were so glad we got a call from them 15minutes later and that there was a table available so we left immediately as it was near our home.This was our 1st visit and we were very impressed by the service and we enjoyed the food very much.After knowing that it was our 1st visit, the lady (I think she is the lady boss) offered suggestions in a very professional manner and no pressure at all and making us very comfortable.We enjoyed the mains for the dinner, the desserts especially the lava cake and the butter scotch budino.Was definitely worth a visit for the cosy n homely ambience.Will definitely go back again !!
