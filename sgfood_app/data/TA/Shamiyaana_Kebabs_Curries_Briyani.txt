it is an average restaurant with humble settings. the furniture is very dated and the sofa seating in the right corner (as you enter) is tattered.the service is slow although the only one person who was taking the orders was very polite."overworked" was clearly written all over him. the service is slow and filling the orders took about 45minutes. we are talking about the a la carte orders.the menu is varied and it appears that this restaurant is concentrating more on its beriyanis/ orders for beriyanis seemed to be filled within ten to fifteen minutes.the quality of the food is good but for the prices quoted in the menu, the servings are somewhat small.each portion is good for one person (indicated for the benefit of those who might be considering sharing the dishes). you will,however, get fair authentic taste of indian food.limited variety of the desserts - the usual gulab jaamun.parking is a bit of problem on site with all the road works going on in syed alwi road
