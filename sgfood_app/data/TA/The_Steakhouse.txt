The food is amazing. Expensive food but ok. You can get share. Staff is friendly and you can get free wifi.

Whilst the steak was ok the restaurant has no wine menu and we were provided with a choice of 4 bottles (brought to our table). A good steak restaurant should have a good wine menu to go with it so I was slightly disappointed.

Must have bone in ribeye ! Great for special occasions, great service & great food . Very rustic steak house feel .
5
My husband and I ordered 2 filet steaks, both cooked to perfection. I had the chocolate cake for dessert which just topped it off. Would recommend.

Really disappointed! Over priced steak - ordered a Porterhouse with asparagus very ordinary!!! Sat outside which is not the best location in Clarke Quay either. Also got the impression even though restaurant opens until 11pm didn't feel too welcome as it got to around 10pm. However, Roy the waiter was helpful

Booked online, but advised not received. Got good table at window though. My wife had sirloin which was good. My fillet steak although cooked to same temperature as sirloin however was tough and left quite a lot. We asked for the bill and waited, and waited........ Eventually we got up and stood at the door. Still no bill. After 10-15 minutes the duty manager returned and we got bill. Never experienced anything like this before. The staff on duty couldn't cope. There was so much smoke coming from the kitchen at one point, the fire alarm went off. Totally new experience.

Good quality steaks - Flavourful and perfectly done. Medium rib-eye was well-grilled on the outside but juicy and slightly pink on the inside. Reasonably priced. Unfortunately, the sides were disappointing. Had to send back the tomato salad first time round because the kitchen forgot to put in the buffalo cheese

Many Clark Quay eateries are noisy and lack intimacy. The Steakhouse is an oasis of calm yet is in the middle of the action. As a lone diner its great to get a window seat and watch the world go buy. The service is very friendly and pleasant and attentive without being in your face. The food is good, maybe a little over seasoned for me but I do not like my food salted too much. It was well cooked and well presented. The house red was also very good. Its not cheap though which is always annoying for Clark Quay but I guess in context its worth it of you want good food in a place where you can chat and relax.Recommended and I will return

I know this place has gotten mixed reviews but I must say that for a large group sharing a bunch of mains, this place provides excellent value for money. Yes, the wine list was limited by a bunch of "blue dots" but the substitute house red (Italian Chianti) was a very nice complement to the meal. The steaks were cooked to perfection. Sides were small but nasty. Service was mixed but still attentive when called. The only disappointment was the dessert which was overcooked (lava cake) or uninspired

Ok so we thought we would try something a little more familiar this evening so we tried The Steakhouse. The board outside looked inviting and the menu had great looking steak and fries. Unfortunately things went wrong when our shared mozzarella salad arrived. Basically there were two tiny specs of mozzarella in the salad ( see pictures ) and when we enqired the waitress never came back with an answer. We started to get hungry so we ate it anyway. Our drinks of wine ran out and sat empty for 30 minutes. It got hot inside and we were really thirsty. The steak eventually arrived and was good but our evening out together was marred by poor service and neglect. To top it off it was expensive at 277 Singapore dollars for the two of us. They need to get more staff and offer better value for money. Do not recommend.
5
Perfect steaks and with big nice glas of Hoegaarden a perfect place to have dinner with friends or business friends. You can sit outside but of course also inside.
4
This is the place if you are a Steak Connoisseur, fine selection, excellent Steak, but expensive.
We were here with friends in March this year and having walked the Clarke area looking for a restaurant we settled for the SteakHouse and we were not disappointed.

It was a birthday dinner for 2 on a Friday night. Other establishments nearby were packed but this restaurant was barely half-filled, and it didn't take long to realize why. A few days prior, we had called to ask about corkage (there was no reply to our email) but the staff who took the call did not seem to know what corkage was. We had also informed the restaurant that it was a birthday dinner and requested for the free small cake they offer to diners celebrating their birthday, but it was never served. The birthday lady at the next table received hers though. But that's alright, we didn't want to have to remind them either. The side dishes we ordered (creamy spinach and baked potato) were ok, but we've had much better steaks. The fillet mignon was very average and the wagyu ribeye was incredibly flat. Both were served medium though we ordered medium rare. There was simply no value for the price we paid. Advice from a local: If you're thinking of dining here, please explore other steakhouses in Singapore - many have consistent good reviews on Tripadvisor. A tip for the restaurant: It's high time the chairs next to the windows get replaced or re-upholstered as they are badly worn out
2
The decor is original and pleasant, and unfortunately that's it.It started with the wines list: around 2 thirds of the list had a blue sticker next to the name of the wine. So i enquire about its meaning, and was told it means these wines were not available any more....2/3 of the list!? Unbelievable.So we ordered an Argentinian wine, at $85S the bottle...nothing cheaper that this.The dishes were tempting, oysters, steaks etcSo we ordered a dozen of oysters and 5 mn later we were served one plate , with 6. Immediately we told the waitress we had ordered 12, so she acknowledged and went.5 mn later without any news, we called an other waitress and told her our story, she apologized and left.10mn later we called a passing by waiter and explained our story again...he apologized, left and came back 5 mn later with the 6 last oysters...The wine was very basic and we did not enjoy it: besides they were offering a 2012 vintage and they served us a 2014..,so we ordered a NZ red, same range of price: they advertised a 2014, they served a 2015... a very disappointing wine too, worse than the first one...And the waiter could not understand why we were upset about the mix in vintages...Then came the meat: at $73S the cut of rib eye we were expecting nothing less than excellence. Very average meat cut indeed.We did not want to spend more money on any sweets.A bad experience, poor and slow service, very seldom in Singapore to have such a disappointing meal

I ate at The Steakhouse because it came recommended from some travel websites. Went there on a Friday night and was surprised to find it almost completely empty. Being excited I sat down and proceeded to order. Things slowly went downhill from there. The waitress rudely plops down my salad then slams my drink and has her back turned to me before it even registers. Exact same thing with the steak, she plops it down and slides it two or three inches... gotta admin she was very accurate withthe slide and it was aligned perfectly with me. Nevetheless it was really rude and i've never seen that behavior from anyone. My steak was ok, you could tell it was a good piece of meat but I just wasn't a fan of the sauce, the truffle fries were salted so heavily I thought they were cooked in salt. I asked for my bill and wait 20 minutes (there were only 3 tables occupied)... The food may have been ok, but the service was horrendous. Never coming back here agai

Also randomly ended up at the Steakhouse at Clarke Quay. Better steak and lamb rack than Brisbane and the open Ravioli of Beef was to die for. Only minor issue we had was they ran out of local beer and we couldnt get a second bottle of the wine we drank cos they ran out. Apart from that...Excellent and friendly service and all 6 of us would recommend a visit
5
Decided to randomly walk into the steakhouse for dinner, during a visit to Singapore. We were not disappointed. The steaks are excellent, and cooked to perfection (one of our party likes the meat well done.... and it arrived well done without being dry nor tough!). The sides are delicious and the staff extremely friendly. We had one of the best meals during our visit.The experience was so positive that we decided to go back a few days later, and the experience was as good.So if you want to have a nice piece of meat cooked to perfection in a nice ambience with friendly service, The Steakhouse is the place to go to
5
We chose this restaurant after wandering around Clarke Quay reading menus. It was early evening so not very busy. The service was friendly and efficient and the atmosphere and music were perfect. I liked the choice offered on the menu; being able to mix and match different steaks, toppings, sauces and sides means there's something for everyone. My husband had the prawns to start and was very happy with them. Our steaks were excellent, perfectly cooked and delicious. I had crème brulee for dessert which, again, was delicious. It was a very expensive meal but we felt it was well worth it as a special night out
5
The steaks here are superb with a wine list to match but expect to pay tourist prices! My 20oz Porterhouse was delicious as were the accompanying salad and asparagus béarnaise. The service was fine if not outstanding but then the clientele are transitory and probably only visit once aa most are tourists. The location is brilliant and right in the heart of a pulsating area at the weekend. Cutting to the chase, if you want a great steak in a great location, look no further

Came here for my birthday dinner with my man and was really looking forward to eating some good steak. Ordered a U.S sirloin for myself and he had the Irish sirloin, both medium rare. I knew my steak was overcooked when I first cut into it. It was tough and chewy, so I told the staff so. She brought it to their manager/supervisor, Chandra, and he brought it right back to us. He insisted it was medium rare and that the outer layer was supposed to be more cooked than the middle. This was obviously not so for my steak, but we didn't push the matter further and finished our meal. I left a few pieces to show them later. When we were paying, my boyfriend told the staff in a polite manner, 'I'm sorry, but I would just like to feedback that our steak was a little overcooked.' Chandra then came back with the receipt and again, started explaining how the steak wasn't overcooked. My boyfriend said 'Yes, I understand, but as you can see, her steak was a medium at the least. We're not trying to get anything for free, we would just like to give our feedback.' Chandra denied it again (despite having seen the pieces I'd left on my plate) and started explaining to us how the steak was supposed to have 3 colors, yaddah yaddah. My boyfriend who is a chef, in an attempt to explain that he knew the cooking process of steak, said politely, 'Yes, I understand. I am a chef as well.' This was when Chandra shocked the both of us. He took the receipt holder back and snapped, 'Yeah, yeah, everybody's a chef.' This comment was uncalled for and just plain rude, especially since my boyfriend is an actual chef. We were not upset about the fact that we got overcooked steak, but the way the staff (Chandra, in particular) handled the situation. If they didn't want to cook a new steak for us, fine, we weren't looking for that anyway, but discrediting a customer's job, which they work hard for, to their face in such a mocking tone shows no respect at all and is extremely unbecoming of him as a supervisor/manager. Safe to say that neither I nor my mother, who patronizes this restaurant with her clients, will ever be coming back

Stopped in for dessert on the way home. Great size serves and really tasty. Reasonably priced and friendly, timely service.

I visited the steakhouse in Clarke Quay with two of my friend. I ordered the the Australian bone rip eye and I did enjoy every bite. I'll definitely come back whenever I wanna enjoy steak in Singapore.
2
for the prices charged, the steaks we had here were below standard - service was also slow and unattentive.
5
Wagu beef was flavoursome and one of the best I've tasted. Wife had pork collar. Equally tasty. Good atmosphere. I will try to return once more before we leave!
5
One of the best steaks I've ever had in my travelling life. Although the food took a while to get served, we received a free round of drinks for the waiting. Also a great ambiance in the restaurant, I would highly recommand this steakhouse.
5
All I can say is just, the best filet mignon. Ues it was pricey but it was the best bit of meat I have ever eaten. Also had the asparagus in a garlic butter sauce and the cajun fries just to help spice it up a little bit. The staff were friendly and the service was great. A must go to Steakhouse when in Clarke Quay
4
I've eaten here 3 times.I eat the Fillet Mignon which I believe is Australian meat. Outstanding EVERY time!A meal for 2 people with side vegetables and wine was SG$166.00.The wine list is pretty good by Asian standards and you can buy by the glass.It's never busy here, but that is because of the price not the food quality. It's really hard to find good beef in Asia, and this place does it well ... consistently. Delicious.The restaurant is located in Clarke Quay which is full-on built for nightlife. After dinner cross over just a few metres to a bar for live music ... just 2 mins walk from the Singapore River. A great spot for couples to enjoy a night out
5
The Steakhouse @ Clarke Quay has become a must for me when in Singapore. Probably there are some steakhouses somewhere in the world where you can have a better prepared and/or tastier steak than here (but I doubt it). But what you donâ€™t can have anywhere is the atmosphere. Sitting outside in the warm Singapore night with all the people, music and rhythm around you is just something you must experience. Expensive, yes, but worth i

The location is the buzzing Clark Quay stretch. Great ambience and service. The non vegetarian food I'm not one to comment onVegetarians, of which I am one - no choice of food - but the service team was gracious to rustle me up a Pasta. Very very filling and great to taste. You can surely visit for that. But past this no choice in foo

You know how sometimes you just need a piece of meat to eat? We had one of those times, and came here mainly because we were staying near to Clarke Quay.We came here a little early-ish. Got a seat without a reservation but it filled up later in the evening. The filet mignon (180g each) was good, and we recommend the potato gratin and the nicely creamy creamed spinach also, washed down with a Singapore Sling (Yep, we're tourists...
5
As always excellent food and great service. Our favorite place in Singapore. Never Han a bad experience there. Will go there soon again.
5
Maybe the best place to go to in Singapore if your looking for a good steakhouse.
Fantastic food, but it is offcourse a bit pricey. Have been there several of times.
3
Good points
- very tasty steaks, perfectly cooked
- good service
- choice of inside/outside dining
Less good
- prices are a bit steep
- over 60% of wines listed not available. Only one Pinot Noir left.
2
This is a very average steakhouse charging above average prices
You can find much better in Singapore
The steak is decent but the staff have no knowledge of the menu and the restaurant had a tired feel to its ambience
Not recommended
5
The tenderest and tastiest rib eye I have ever had. Pricy, but it is worth it. If there is one restaurant you have to try in Singapore, this is it!
4
Ate here for our NYE dinner and were warned by the less than par service. But the food was really good. I mean really really good. We still have dreams about the 20oz. Ribeye ($80) and the 11oz. Tenderloin ($69). The service might have been slow but the food made up for it. It was a good idea to have a reservation as well. Price tag on the steaks were steep but compared to Singapore steak prices, it was competitive enough. All in all it was a good experience. The boyfriend was very pleased as well.
4
Four of us visited for an evening meal. They had Wagyu beef/steak on special which I tried, but unfortunately it resembled minute steak (very thin) and as I asked for it to be medium well it was pretty solid. However the others had filet mignon, a much thicker cut, which was very good. Sides and extras are good but as others have mentioned, pricey. It was pretty quiet when we were there but the staff were quick and competent and it's a reasonable night out
4
This is a nice place to eat in Clarke Quay, you can sit inside or outside, the food and staff were good but it did get very busy and noisy which became a distraction. Nice if you want a lively night but not the place if you are looking for a quiet mea
5
We were looking for a nice place for our last night in Singapore and the Steakhouse did not disappoint! Staff were friendly and the meal was stunning. It was the best meal by far that we had during a week there.We both had the lamb rack and they were perfectly cooked and beautiful presented. Expensive but on par with equivalent restaurants in Singas. I totally recommend this restaurant.
3
I have mixed feelings about the experience we had at this restaurant, more negatives than positives.Positives:- nice and quiet, away from the tacky in-your-face music that embodies Clarke Quay.- meals were tasty enough, though one was sent back for not being cooked through (chicken).Negatives:- I asked the waitress if a Filet Mignon was the same as an eye-fillet, she had no idea what I was talking about. I explained what I meant, a small round thick piece, she said yes and then it came out a thin flat piece. I guess that's what she meant when she asked if I minded it was "cut", so they clearly butterflied the steak to cook it medium well! I thought she meant if I minded it cut a little bit to see if it was cooked inside. Bizarre.- service was slow, even though there were only 3 small tables occupied in the restaurant- staff were only as friendly as was required of them, no personality or warmth. Felt like we were being watched.- saw the chef eating his dinner through the window, come out to the bar and get an iced water ( it would be nice if customers were offered some iced water but no) then go back to start cooking our meal. Now by all means eat your dinner but don't do it in front of customers!!- UTTERLY expensive!!! 2 drinks (juices with no alcohol) 2 mains with potato and veg and 2 desserts came to $170. Not good value in our opinion.
5
Great place to spend the evening. Ordered the Chateaubriand and it was excellent. Would definitely recommend.
4
The Steakhouse in Clarke Quay is a good spot to enjoy a great steak, good wine or draft beers and a fine outdoor dining experience. The staff is attentive but not intrusive which is how I like it.
5
My husband and I didn't expect to find such excellent steak at Clarke Quay. We just happened to be out on date night and couldn't get a table on club street so ended up here. The steak is fantastic and reasonably priced. I have eaten at most of the high end steak restaurants here in Singapore, Cut etc and this place rates up there with the best of them. I also liked the glass window that allowed you to see into the kitchen where they are grilling your steak. I will be back soon

It was a busy Saturday night in Clarke Quay but they were able to fit the two of us in. We had a great window seat and enjoyed watching people and all of the activity going on outside.We both had Filet Mignon sourced from Australia. Our steaks were good cuts of meat, cooked well and very tasty. I liked that you could choose the size of the cut as well. The steaks come with your choice of sauce or condiment but you have to order sides separately. We chose the potato gratin and grilled asparagus with béarnaise to share. Again these were nice dishes. To finish we shared the Crème Brulee with mixed berries, which was delicious.To accompany our meal we chose a bottle of red wine. We had to choose three different bottles as we kept being told they were out of stock with each of our choices which we found a bit poor. This information wasn’t delivered in the best manner. We found the service throughout the meal was what let this restaurant down. The staff weren’t very attentive or personable. It’s a shame as for the price of the meals you would expect a better level of service. Pricey, even for Singapore, each of our 8oz steaks were $49 with the price of each side varying from $9 - $14.We really enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere and would recommend dining here based on this. The service just needs improvement
4
Food was really good, (salad starters, chicken & steak for mains) price fairly average for Singapore which tends to be on the expensive side.Only 'complaint' the bill was brought to us without us asking for it & before the plates were cleared or asked if we would like dessert (which we would probably have had) however we were happy with the food/drinks so happy to give it 4 star
2
Went to the bar for martinis while checking out the menu. Nice martini which was in the drinks list at $14 each. Charged $52 so we questioned it and the managed was really defensive saying it wasn't a standard measure/it was a dry martini not standard martini, he had used premium spirit not house (even though we watched him make it with house vodka) and it was the correct price. Decided not to get ripped off any further on food so left. Shame as it looked nice but won't try again. Check the price before you orde
5
Working in Singapore for 5 months, we visited the Steakhouse in Clarkes Quay several times.Best steak I have been served.Vegetables and different kind of potatoes each time cooked to perfection.If I return again, I will definitely visit here.Pricey, but worth every penny
4
My partner and I visited the steakhouse in January. We decided to head to Clarke Quay after a busy day being tourists and just walk around and decide which restaurant to try.We settled on this restaurant and went inside. Clarke Quay was extremely busy for a Monday night, however this restaurant was pretty much empty, however that didn't deter us.We ordered a steak and pork. Both were cooked well and very tasty and enjoyable.The only thing that could be improved on was the service. The few waitresses that we encountered were quite glum and not very friendly which was disappointing as this is a nice restaurant with upmarket prices to match. A smile goes a long way and if we were to return we hope that this will be rectified
4
Really excellent steaks - mainly from Australia. The filets were very well prepared exactly as ordered and served with grilled Asparagus with a nice sauce. The Ceaser salad was well prepared with a poached egg, although the lettuce was a bit warmer than I like.Overall a great choice, although the service was bit uneven, the food was good enough o overcome some wait staff inattentiveness
5
We decided to have a nice dinner in Dec ’14 at Clarke Quay, and settled for The Steakhouse. It was indeed one of the best steaks we’ve tried. Perfect 10 for the food! Just wish the price tag would have been equally ideal (we spent S$188 on 3 dishes). It was a sleek and cozy setup, perfect for a romantic dinner. We had a good seat by the window that gave us a view of the passer-bys (those seats fill up fast, so you may want to make a reservation in advance). The service staff were knowledgeable and attentive, and were able to give us real recommendations on the menu (we believe that’s what all F&B service staff should do, rather than simply say “everything is good here”).

Good place to get wagyu beef with truffle fries. Wine menu was a little bit boring, but in total a good restaurant.
4
The food was good. Well prepared steaks.!
Since we wanted to smoke we sat outside.. This was a mistake.
Top tip - have a table inside
2
The food was below average but very expensive, (ask for the Australian sirloin, it was un-eatable & $47) the service was non existent, ask for a glass of water 3 times to different waiters, no one Brough me the water & the restaurant wasn't full. Overall a very poor experience, will not be coming back.
5
One of the best steaks I have ever had, the truffles fries are to die for and the wine list extensive. The service is attentive and not too fast or pushy which I enjoy. The restaurant is rather dark, bare and has a masculine feel to it. We sat inside by the windows overlooking the hustle and bustle in Clarke Quay. There is also an option to sit outside, however we wanted to escape the heat. I’m sure there are many tourist traps in this area but the Steakhouse really serves excellent steaks. I have eaten here two times and will come back here next time I’m in Singapore

Lets be honest, what comes to mind when someone mentions "clarke quay"? Alcohol, alcohol, party, alcohol, party and more alcohol. So yea, when my girlfriend told me there is a good steak house at clarke quay honestly i was a little bit skeptical. But nevertheless, i decided to give it a shot and honestly, no regrets whatsoeva. Iam BIG fan of steaks. I've tried numerous steakhouses here and there and a few of the best steakhouses in singapore and to be really frank, this is up there with the rest. First of let me tell you more about the steak and way the steak is cooked. The steak that i had, if i remember correctly, was the US Prime Angus Ribeye. I like my steak to be medium/medium well (depending on restaurants), it was of cause, cooked to perfection. Just the way i like it, juicy and very very flavourful. The steak is charcoal grilled which explains why its so flavourful, it has tinge of sweetness and barbuque kinda flavour from the charcoal, which i love and in my opinion is what makes a good steak. Also the charcoal grilled style is used in numerous top steak houses which explains why i said "The steakhouse" is up there amongst the good steakhouses in singapore. So, when i see other people complaining about the steak/the food in general being expensive, honestly i dont think so. Because the cut/beef that they use and the way they cook it is at that kinda level where its up there with the big time steakhouses around singapore. Have u guys even been to the other steakhouses around singapore? If you think this is expensive, why not try out the "BIG" named steakhouses. And iam not even done, my girlfriend decided to try the chef's recommendation pasta which was the open ravioli of beef and guys... it was amazing! it was like an explosion in my mouth. it had so many flavour in it and no it wasnt like "all over the place" kinda taste, it was a proper step by step/progressive kinda taste. So yea, when people say its expensive, honestly i dont think so AS A STEAKHOUSE. Yes, i understand that in clarke quay itself, a meal like that MIGHT be a little bit expensive. Cause most of the restaurants there are kinda fast food based, pub kinda style of food and a not a site down quietly and enjoy ur food kinda environment. Which kinda shows why "The Steakhouse" is a hidden gem in clarke quay. Because this restaurant is so different then the rest. Its a place for you to enjoy a good meal and relax before u "destroy" urself ;) As for my service experience, it was great. I sat inside, because i was there to have a good meal/time with my girlfriend and just relax. And to be honest, if you want to sit outside, then this isnt the place for you. In a nut shell, would i go back? Hell yea! Not just for the food, but for everything in general
1
Terrible from beginning to end. No customer service, food dry and burnt, 6 dollars for bottle water and they don't have tap. When complaining to the manager he simply said he was sorry but I will still pay it, after screwing up my bill 3 times. Hands down the worst dinning experience of my life
4
The steak was fantastic. Just the way I ordered it and excellent quality. For the price they could have added some side dishes like salad, vegetables and fries but all this has to be ordered separate which made it even more expensive. Would still go back though!
5
One of the best steakhouses I ever been. We took a table outside as the night was very nice. The choice of Australian beef or US is very welcome and we had an excellent steak with different choices of sauces and sides. A little bit expensive but really worth to come
3
We had dinner as a family and sat outside. The tables outside were very basic: no decoration at all, no table cloth, we felt like in a french bistrot.Food was ok, but for the price rather modest if it comes to the size of burgers.My 11 oz sirloin was perfectly grilled medium, but not hot, when served. This might be due to the fact, that the plate was not hot at all, but only lukewarm. Shame.Very annoying: They do not offer any ice water!! Whatever you want to drink there, you have to pay for it!In total very highly priced for what you ge

In Singapore with a company director and he wanted to experience Clarke Quay, one of my favourite areas in Singapore.Had a drink at the Highlander, then wandered down to the Steakhouse 2 minutes away.It was a stunning Singapore night, 26 deg, low humidity no wind.We settled in to an outdoor table to take in the atmosphere as the crowd grew and the atmosphere intensified.He had a beer, I started straight away on a nice Shiraz.We both chose steak, him the wagyu rib eye, me the sirloin. We added some truffle fries, salad and asparagus with bernaise sauce.The atmosphere was typical of Clarke Quay, the food was outstanding and service pretty good.It was hard to leave, but eventually we did.If you get to Singapore and want something other than Asian, try The Steakhouse, it's not cheap, but not much is in the finer dining areas of Singapore. Two wines, one beer, Food - 9/10Drinks - 8/10Service - 8/10Atmosphere - 9/1
4
We wanted a more "up market" restaurant compared to the majority that are at Clarke Quay, and The Steakhouse was fine. The interior was nicely laid out, and the food and service was great. We had nothing to complain about.
1
Nothing very impressive, mediocre food, below average service. I boycott any restaurant in Singapore that has a policy against serving tap water in order to inflate their average check by selling you mineral water at ridiculous prices. Not returning here on account of that.
2
Decided to try the Steakhouse on our last night in Singapore as craving a nice bit of beef. Read some questionable reviews but took the chance as it looked nice and we were very tired and couldn’t face the huge choice of offerings at Clarke Quay! Didn’t start off too well when the waitress wasn’t sure what the special was, or whether it was even available. Crab starter was probably the best part of the night, although it did take the staff about 15 mins to take our plates away, and it was quiet. Now if your going to put the name of a food in the title of your restaurant its probably an idea to find a chef that can cook it. My medium rare filet, was actually rare, verging on blue, I returned it to the kitchen myself as it seemed there was little chance of any of the staff approaching the table, clearly too busy on their mobiles. The waitress then helpfully suggested that it might be because it was a thick cut of meat, thanks for that insight! The chef looked very unhappy that it had been returned and offered no apology whatsoever. Somewhat predictably the steak was then returned overcooked! An unprofessional, overpriced restaurant offering below average food. many, many better options on Clarke Quay
4
The cut was good and the steak was perfectly grilled to our request. One of the best steak house I have dine in Singapore.The service staff is polite and helpful and they are able to professionally provide their recommendation as well. I am pleased with my wine and dine experience here. However, due to the price tag, I will return only if there is an occasion and not for casual dining
5
On 5th of July (7pm) I had a steak at this restaurant. I am a discerning eater and VERY seldom impressed but this restaurant really pleased me. Its not Mortons or Raffles Steak Bar but its way better than CUT by Wolgang Puck which I think is a hopelessly over rated "diner" with big boys prices, streets ahead of the Black Angus Grill on Orchard which has lost direction. Its located in a fun area near the Singapore River and Clarke Quay with lots to do and see. The price is top end, drinks are reasonable - the mohjito's are good, the service was spot on, noise levels were fine, seating wasn't too close (unlike CUT) and the service was really good. I highly recommend this restaurant
3
Having paid my bill at the Steakhouse at Clarke Quay in Singapore I can confirm that this city really is the most expensive in the world. My companion had a beef burger which a came with french fries and a small salad - the priciest burger I have ever bought! I had a basic sirloin steak which was cooked to perfection but tasted of nothing. A glass of red wine was an extortionate price. All in all very expensive for an average steak mea

If you like good steaks in Singapore, The Steakhouse at Clarke Quay is the right place for you. Clarke Quay as place is full of life, especially during weekends, and it is nice to sit outside and watch the hectic night life while having your dinner. The beefs are good but also expensive. As a minus the cook’s opinion about “baked potatoes” and my diverged completely, so be aware that you may have an almost cold bad tasting thing on your plate instead of the baked potato that you ordered

Noticed the place at it stood out from the other restaurants at Clarke Quay, and the interior is indeed nice (don't think the main picure on this page is from that restaurant, by the way). So was the initial welcomme and service, but from there it went downhill... The orders were wrong, the food (which we choose to accept despite it bein wrong) was nothing but ordinary, and the service was slooow. All in all not worth the price

This is one of the riverside area restaurants with all its busy and colourful night life. As we wanted some western food after many days of Asian food I ordered a sirloin steak and my wife the rack of lamb. It took a small eternity before the food arrived, but when we were finally served the food was tasty. When the bill arrived we were reminded that this is Singapore which is not cheap, but this bill was almost Norwegian prices

Amazing service and even better food. Yes, it was expensive, but it was worth every cent. I had a perfectly cooked steak that melted in my mouth with a lobster tail from heaven. The wine (recommended by the staff) complimented the meal perfectly. My wife had a perfectly cooked pasta which was fresh and tasty. I can't speak highly enough of this place. Fantastic

This is not a cheap meal. But if you appreciate good steak cooked to perfection with excellent wine & excellent service this is the place for you

If you are going straight for the food, it is great. Done proper to your order.
I find this place rather a bit claustrophobic, when the house is full.
Service is alright.

We chose this place by accident and wow what a great find. Clam chowder was delish and steak, ribs and fish were perfectly cooked. High quality produce, nicely presented and so tasty. There were 19 of us and everything was fantastic. Thank you guys.

During my last visit over a year ago, I was not impressed with the steaks. So I was a bit skeptical to book this restaurant for my colleagues out of town.However, the evening turned out be nice and the steaks were excellent. We had originally booked outdoor seating but were accommodated inside (we changed our mind). The steaks were excellent and cooked to perfection. The range and choices were adequate (although a bit pricey). The accompanying sauces were small portions and I definitely needed more. wine list was good and had some good choices.Overall a nice experience

I had dinner here recently and we ordered prawn cocktail and beef starter to go with.. It was amazing and we really enjoyed it so much, *really need to improve on the bread! Really tough and chewy... Then we ordered wagyu special, ribeye MS8+ and Angus rib eye 300g. Super amazing!! Mushroom and cream spinach! Lemon tart is refreshing too after fatty wagyu! Phew! Service need to be more personalized and sincere.. We are forgoten most of the time.. T_T Good food! Service? Let all of u decide.

A great lesson in why you should check out TripAdviser before dining out. It seems that previous reviewers not the slow service. Our experience was that it to 80 minutes for two steaks, fries and a salad to be served. The food was average. Even the wine took 20 minutes. We definitely will not be going back

We were walking around Clarke Quay with friends deciding on a place to eat dinner when we all agreed a steak sounded good. The restaurant has nice decor and was halfway filled with patrons. Our server, while courteous, took too long to get our cocktails and orders. Unless the staff was short-handed that night, I can see no reason why the service was slow at the outset.When the food did arrive, my rib-eye was fantastic. Two in our party ordered the beef short rib and both orders were extremely fatty - one in our party complained. Our server did bring out an order of salmon to make up for that.OVERALL: Pricey, great location, a little slow on service, good food

The prices may be expensive even for Singapore, but the steaks ( I had the Australian rib eye - S$42 for about 200gm - cooked medium) are really excellent. They come with a choice of a range of sauces, and there is a selection of sides which from our experience were well prepared although not large. The steaks though were an excellent size and prepared as we had requested. My wife had a filet mignon which she loved. The is a small range of non-steak dishes for those wishing something different. The wine list had a range from around the world, again quite expensive (alcohol is normally very expensive in Singapore), but the Australian red we selected was excellent (about S$125 bottle). The restaurant is in a very lively area with a good range of restaurants and bars which do a great trade late into the night. It would be suitable for a large business/family group

The Steakhouse lived up to its name in the quality of the steaks that we had but they do come at a top end price. The wine in particular was rather expensive for what it was. Service was OK but not particularly memorable.

Nice place.....
Food preparation & portions - can do better.
Steak layout and pricing - reasonable
Waiters - can do better service
Value for money - average

The steak here is good, although I have my steam meduim rare, it came meduim as did my husbands. The restaurant is an expensive price which is similar to the rest of singapore, the drinks were S$16 for a glass of house wine (£8!!!) the meal came to S$ 220 with 4 drinks and two main meals. The problem here is that it is next to a nightclub with banging bass speakers which drowned out the music in this restaurnt and proved to be quite annoying

This is the place to go in Singapore if you like a good steak and at the same time like to watch the hectic night life at Clarke Quay. For a person like me coming from the far (cold) north it is an unbelievable experience to late in the evening dine at their terrace in the warm tropical night when hundreds and hundreds of people are passing by and from all restaurants and night-clubs in the neighbourhood is fowing music in a crazy mixture."The Steakhouse" is an expensive restaurant, but the meat is of best quality, the cooks know how to prepare a good steak and the wine list is extensive and (to be in Singapore) reasonable priced.I have been there several times and will surely visit them again when next time in Singapore

Had dinner here, ordered Porterhouse Steak (i believe this is what it was called..), as well as US Sirloin Steak. Had variety of sauces to choose from to have with steak. Overall steaks were very tasty but quality is average (or just slightly above). Starters / sides were quite small. For starters we ordered the Escargots (delicious, especially for garlic lovers), crabcakes (not bad) as well as garlic bread (average, after all its just garlic bread). We also ordered some french onion soup which was tasty (these are served with a round piece of bread topped with cheese, on the side). For dessert we had creme brulee and chocolate molten cake. Creme brulee was ok and choco molten cake quite good (served warm with ice cream and a few berries on the side) - however I have tasted better molten cakes at cafes in S'pore such as Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (Warm chocolate cake), and Island Creamery Dessert Shop (Chocolate lava cake). Service was not bad, had two waiters who were both very attentive and helpful. Overall food was not bad, though for the price paid ($700 for 6, expected a little more). Honestly, I don't think I would go back but there's no harm trying out the food here

My friends and I dined at The Steakhouse a few days ago and we were impressed with their service and food standard. At first we thought the steak was a bit pricey, but after tasting it, we all agreed that its worth the price. The service satff were helpful in explaining the different kind of cuts for the steaks too.I give the presentation of the food 9/10. We will definitely visit The Steakhouse again

The food was average. For a specialty steak restaurant at such high prices my Sirloin steak was OK. I had to cut out almost 20% of fat out of it. When we complained no explanation was offered.The restaurant refused to serve tap water and charged for bottled water, overcharged for the wine (we had it corrected). The order was not reconfirmed resulting in a mix up.All in all a poor experience. Clarke Quay has many options, that would be better
3
The quality of the meat was good. The price for 2 people over $200 SGD. Wine selection for themeal was a pretty average Italian Chianti. I thought the price was high due to the lack of quality service. I saw the waiter three times during the meal service. For this price you would expect a little better.

Have eaten here many many times and the steak is passable as i usually order the fillet everytime, this time i brought guests and we ordered the Cote de Boeuf (supposed to be for 2) - we waited an hour and he meat them came out was appalling - over 50% pure fat. We were so shocked and hungry we showed the waiter who showed the chef who agreed it was very fatty... there only solution was to offer us free desserts ( none of us eat desserts) and then 10% off the bill.. given the Cote de Boeuf was 145 and we had spent 350 total... 30 dollars ( GST applied after and complusory 10% service charge) we got 30 bucks off - pretty pathetic given we then had to go somewhere else and order a proper dinner. Proper disappointed for the treatment after spenign lots of money there on many occasions. Overall impression meat average on a good day, over priced, slow and terrible waiters/management... good luc

We passed this by and went to the BBQ across from it but left when the said they had run out of chicken !!!!!!! , Anyway we went in the steak house I ordered the prawn cocktail to start which came with 5 whole prawns on the dish for $22.00 (£11) the sauce had chilli in it so was a bit hot for my taste ,the wife had crab cakes $18 (£9.00) which she said we delicious and a side of garlic bread to share $6.00 (£3.00), for the mains she had the Angus beef burger $30 (£15) this came with salad and fries , I had the 11oz Ribeye from oz $58 (£27) medium rare which was to die for although you have to pay for sides roasted mushrooms $8.00(£4.00) , 4asparagus stalks $14.00 (£7.00) and potato gratin $8.00(£4.00) . A glass of tiger beer was $12.00 (£6.00) and a glass of coke was $6.00 (£3.00) the drink were the same price as most other places the total bill for 2 of us was $212.00 +$21.20 service charge and GST was $16.32 total $249.55 (about £125.00) but thats no different for a quality night out In Leeds , Yorkshire ,U

Chateau Briand...Delicous, service brillant, ambience superb!

Considering the payment of $75 for a steak and a beer, I expected better service than I recieved. Too long waiting for a mediochre sized opiece of beef.

A little on the expensive side, but good quality charbroiled steaks.

Second time here. I think the steaks here are excellent. I had the Filet Mignon as that is thicker, and I like it rare. they seem to understand what rare is, unlike most places that overcook generally. The side order of vegetables was a little unimpressive (overcooked and sparse), but the other side dishes (asparagus, fries) were good. Starters very good (I think I had crabcake), although oysters (my first choice) had run out. Wine list not bad, although they did not have my first choice for wine. Overall very good place, recommended

Had a meal at The Steakhouse in Clarke quay last night. Not sure about the bad reviews here but I thought it was worth it! I ordered a mushroom soup and fillet mignon (200g) with a side serving of mash potato. The soup came with fine mushroom grinded the way I liked it. Not too thick or watery. The steak was nicely done and overall I thought it was excellent. The waiter gladly gave me another helping of the mushroom sauce when asked. The place was 50% occupied mainly expats and tourist. Must be doing something good else you wouldnt find foreigners eating there

Decor fine, feels like a chain though, or part of a group, which it is.The steak comes in 2 sizes 200g (about 4oz) and 300g (6oz). In plain or "Cajun" style.We ordered the 200g ribeye, mine plain Australian grain fed, my husbands Australian Wagyu.When our order arrived we were surprised to see steaks that almost covered half the plate .... and were <1cm thick. We decided they must pound them like schnitzel, why would they do that?Both steaks were fairly tender but the thickness (or lack of) made it feel like we were eating sliced meat rather than a steak.They were also both quite cold and really, very heavily seasoned. The seasoning tasted like some store bought msg-loaded rub. The kind of thing you would get on a frozen, pre-formed steak. I even wondered if they had given me the Cajun version.Sides (creamed spinach and potato gratin) were small but fine.Bearnaise sauce was very oily and not much of it.With 2 glasses of house wine the bill came to $199. Actually less $8 as they initially tried to charge us for the side that came free with the Wagyu. Hard to know if this was a true accident - I'm sure most people don't notice.Not really good value for money. If the steak was thicker (and smaller in diameter), warmer and less artificially seasoned we would have felt it was OK value for money

Had the 200g ribeye. The steak was fantastic! But the service was poor. I sat by myself for at least 15mins before I was asked for my drink order and then another 30 mins before I had to flag someone down to take my order. The worst was that my steak was ready before I even got my salad. I ordered the carmalized apple crepes for dessert. Not good. First the apples were not carmalized and then they were just served on top of the crepe.For the steak, I would definitely bear the poor service again

I stopped by this place one evening last week. Ordered a 300g fillet minion, med rare and I got a juicy MR lean tasty steak. The baked potato was very nice but the veggies let the dish down by being slightly undercooked.The service was reasonable. Staff were professional but not very welcoming but not not noticeably so

Ok, maybe going for steaks in the tourist trap that is Clarke Quay was a bad idea. But we were hungry and that is where we were, and we didn't know Singapore had a Mortons, so that is where we went.Food was average.... similar offering to a Ruth's Chris but about half as good. That however was unexceptional and if it wasn't for the events of the next paragraph I wouldn't have even bothered reviewing it.The biggest flag or an otherwise unexceptional meal was this: we were served Singapore tap water in a Figi water bottle. After our Figi water cooled down, we found it tasted, well, basically like tap water. We asked our server to confirm the water was Figi and they informed us it was without a doubt genuine Figi. However, upon returning to our hotel we tried a) tap and b) Figi (from the minibar) at a consistent temperature and were left in no doubt that we'd been served tap.Now, it's not a huge deal - Singapore tap water is ultimately safe. But it did cast a grey cloud over an otherwise unexceptional meal and means I couldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone

me and my friends went there hopping to try out their charcoal grill steaks which we heard about , but it turn out to be a nightmare.the steaks are too burnn and it taste very unpleasant.you cant event taste the flavour of the beef.the service staff who attend to our table was speaking too fast n rude when we ask her for a serving of ice water.well after going through a rude server,we were hopping to taste the flavour of the angus beef which we had order,waitting almost more than half an hour then finally our steaks arrived,but all the other sidedish n sauces took them about another 15 minutes.when all the other dishes arrived,we started cutting our steaks and with the first piece that i took a bite it taste burn and bitter.call the server and complain about thye incident,she turn around and told me that this is the way how we grill the steaks,my two other friends whome order chicken n a fish were lucky not to have the beef that i had.at least they had finish their dinner.not to make a fuss,i just ate the side dishes and done with my dinner.my friends ask me to make a complaint to the manager,but i think that why do i want to waste more words.my dinner plate that they clear would explain it for itself.were very lucky that night we had great fun at the following place that we went to.bad burn bad
