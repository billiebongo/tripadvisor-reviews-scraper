the rice bowl portion is quite big. but if want to diet, i think the rice bowl a little oily and heavy.

Interesting menu with a twist. Slow service and inattentive service staff. Paid restaurant price, left unsatisfied and hungry even after trying almost every dish on the menu. Definitely need to improve on service and dish pacing.

Staff were friendly & attentive. Food overall was good but some dishes serving were small. Nice place to chillax.
Personally I would hope they can increase their wine selection though.

Food was pretty good and unique. The wait was quite long though. It was quite weird that it was so empty.

Food was generally decent, composition of usual dishes you find in chinese tze char places, but with a different creative twist. Even though it works fine, the value of the dishes are a tad on the high side. Worth at least a visit to try the food thoug

Food was great! Interesting twist to the local zichar food. We ordered the BKT jelly, which my partner really enjoyed. Wasn't a standout for me, as I found the gelatinous texture abit weird. The beef cheek was fork tender, I felt that everything on the plate came together - the sauce, mash, and pears, together with the beef. This was really yummy! As I'm a big fan of pitan tofu, of course I had to order that! It was really yummy, the pitan sauce was just nice - not too sweet or salty. I love that they gave an excess of sauce, perfect for mixing with the rice! Neeess to say, we mopped up everything on the plate :D Last dish we had, was steamed broccoli with almond and furikake. Which the vegetable was sweet, and it was steamed to perfection, still retaining the crunchiness, I felt that it was quite pricey at a price of $8 for a small serving. Also there were a lot of broccoli stems served in our portion. I like that they serve other grains like brown rice here, though it's $3/bowl, portion was rather generous. Definitely order a carb to mop up the yummy sauce from the various dishes! It was really quiet when we went there on a Wednesday night. Service staff was pretty attentive, though if you're siting outside, it may be harder to get their attention, like all other places. Don't come here expecting local zichar pricing. But you'll be surprised and satisfied with the food!
