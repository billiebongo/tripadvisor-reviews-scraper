The food is great, especially the sashimi, however the prices are very expensive. Good to dine here if you have the Eatigo or Entertainer discounts.

Had a family dinner here and everything was fantastic and they were also very accommodating for vegetarians and our 6 month old Daughter which made the experience even more enjoyable. All the food was very fresh, highly recommend to all

It is fresh tasty and delightfully cheap because of eatigo discount at 40%. The chirashi is good value and try their salad too. Maki is forgettable.

Good Japanese restaurant in the heart of Singapore. Fresh good quality fish. Averages prices. The only note is that the kitchen closes at 10pm and in this it is quite accurate.

Food is fantastic and fresh. Nice setting and attentive service. Top up with a great discount booked under Eatigo.
Recommended Jin Maki.

I happen to chance the one for one promotion for Chirashi don. The picture looks good and we decided to book for it. Based on experience, there might be discount on the food if it is on promotion but at Jin I donâ€™t have this experience. We got the Jin Chirashi, everything is good, even wasabi as I am not having wasabi because of the after taste but here is good. Sashimi is fresh and really nice. The sushi rice especially nice. We also ordered the gyoza, it is slightly expensive that usual you had outside. It came with 4 rectangle shaped gyoza and tasted good. The only complain was when they serve me the miso soup, the cover dropped into the soup. They did put back to the counter which I thought they will change a new one but surprisingly they took out the cover and wash it. Next they just put back to cover the miso soup. For this kind of fine dining place, I would expect more. Still I did drank the soup, luckily nothing happen

I returned to this Japanese restaurant after a gap of quite some time for lunch yesterday. This time I opted for the Chirashi set, which came with a miso soup. The sushi was quite decent but it's not particularly cheap after you add in service and tax

We were staying at the Amoy so kept walking past this interesting looking restaurant. So on a whim had lunch. The dishes we were presented with looked good & were tasty. Helpful service to.Chatting to the manager as we were last to leave she said the dinner menu was quite different. So the next day for our last night in Singapore we returned. Wow a big step up in style & sophistication . We did some saki tasting to. Just brilliant. The white bait fritters really impressed! Not a budget restaurant however, good value as quality is on show & tastes excellent.

Walked past the lobby of Amoy Hotel and saw this restaurant a few times. Today, my husband suggested trying here for dinner. Am generally apprehensive of trying new Japanese restaurants as I am very particular about my Japanese food. Turned out to be much better than I expected. Service: Friendly and efficientWifi : NoneFood: We ordered a sale, the cod fish nabe, the ikura chawamushi and business bento set. Everything was well-executed! Drinks: We had matcha Tea and refill is complimentary !

Have been here for business lunch several times. The set lunch is good value and food is good.
On weekends is pretty quiet without the CBD crowd. Check out Eatigo for up to 50% off! We enjoyed 50% discount on a Sat night.

A really very good Japanese restaurant on the edge of the CBD. All the food freshly made and the staff very friendly and efficient. I would gladly return on a frequent basis!
5
A quick feed of miso soup, green tea and absolutely fabulous sushi - try the Jin Maki - it was brilliant

The restaurant serves good value set lunch. I had sasahmi and teriyaki chicken set. The teriyaki chicken is really yummy.

Good price for quality Japanese food! Wagyu steak was delicious, and their tempura was fresh & delicious! Don't feel oily at all.

This is a partial review only relating to our stay at the Amoy hotel for which the Jin restaurant provides an included breakfast. The breakfast is a semi buffet with waitress service and eggs and other items cooked to order in the kitchen. Overall it is a simple basic breakfast with average food. Hope this helps

I've now been to Jin Dining three times. The food is actually pretty good value given the location - the set is sufficiently large. I had the beef and sashimi lunch set and the beef was quite filling. I previously has the tempura and salmon set. Service is OK - efficient but nothing special; the staff are busy.
5
Had dinner at Jin with some friends who highly recommended it as one if the best restaurants for authentic Japanese food in Singapore. Located at the lobby level of the Amoy hotel, the restaurant's atmosphere is rustic and quiet. Chef Thomas Koh dished out a delicious menu for us comprising fresh seafood and sashimi as well as pork belly and much more. Accompanied by a bottle of warm sake, this was easily one of the best Japanese meals I had so far. Value for money and definitely recommended

Came back here again today for lunch with a colleague. Opted for the tempura and chicken teriyaki lunch set and supplemented with a cake. I was a little disappointed with the chicken today - didn't really taste that fresh. The tempura was decent though. Also a bit annoying were the multiple upselling tactics of the staff, trying to add extras to the base meal and increase the overall cost. Might give this one a break for a while

Craving non-specific Japanese food, we ordered the Wagyu beef gozen dinner set. At $48++, you get a small plate of sashimi, chawanmushi, miso soup, rice and slices of Saga wagyu beef with a simple accompanying salad. The sashimi was fresh (salmon, lean tuna, trevally). The chawanmushi was ok, but the real star was the wagyu beef. Served with crisp slices of fried garlic, it was melt-in-the-mouth perfect. Beautifully red in the middle and just charred on the outside, it perfectly accompanied the sticky white rice. An added bonus was getting to talk to chef Thomas Kok, who proudly explained the origins and quality of the beef. He is one of the pioneer chefs of Japanese cuisine in Singapore and a wealth of knowledge. It was obvious that many of his customers were regulars, a group which we were soon to join. Well worth checking out.They also offer well arranged set lunches starting from $22.80++

Very happy overall. Best Wagu beef I've ever had, superb sashimi.
Highly recommended
Located in the lobby of the Amoy hotel behind capital square

We ate here whist staying at the AMOY hotel. The food was beautifully prepared and presented and tasted fantastic.
It is expensive but if you like Japanese food, it is the best I have tasted!

Being a fan of Chirashi, this establishment didnt dissapoint. I am enamored by the freshness of their seafood and decadence of their rice. Their service is great, I sincerely felt their warmth and food appreciation althrough out our dinner. I will surely come back! Maybe tomorrow lunch

My favourite dish here is the Wagyu Sashimi set at lunch time during the week. The meat is slightly rare and melts in your mouth and the sashimi is very fresh. At $32, it's really great value. Recommend it every time. And people I've taken there go back for more.

Came back here after a space of more than a year for lunch. No reservation but we were able to get seats at the counter without difficulty. Small but good selection of lunch sets. Decent portions. Service was a little slow but mainly due to the restaurant being busy. Overall very good
4
The food is great. Good quality stuff for quite reasonable prices during lunch time. The serving size needs to be a bit larger, as I wasn't quite full after the meal. I had the sashimi and wagyu beef set, which I enjoyed. The place is quite small and crowded during lunch time though.

I have been to Jin Fine Dining many times and 90% of the time I have chosen the Bara Chirashi Don. The sashimi is fresh and presented in big chunks on top of very nicely seasoned Hokkaido rice. I need to try the other sets and offerings but I am sure they will be as good as my favourite dish! Chef Thomas is also a very nice and hospitable guy and sometimes comes out to chat with the diners. His commitment to quality food is very clear and appreciated.Comfort food at its best

Came here today on a friend's recommendation to try the lunch options. There's a decent selection of very reasonably priced lunch sets available. I opted for the sashimi and teriyaki lunch set, my colleague for the teriyaki and tempura set. We supplemented the food with a small bottle of sake (also quite a good selection at reasonable prices). Good size servings and decent food. Service could have been a little better but I think our waitress was just inexperienced (no issues with politeness). I would like to return to try the omakase dinner option

Housed within AMOY Hotel, JIN Fine Dining is helmed by renowned sushi chef, Thomas Kok. Previously from Hokkaido Sushi Restaurant at M Hotel, Chef Thomas Kok prides his food on the use of fresh quality ingredients along with skillful technique and creative flair in executing his cooking.READ MORE: http://www.misstamchiak.com/jin-fine-dining/Marrying authentic Japanese culinary philosophy with fresh, air-flown ingredients and modern cooking techniques, fans of Japanese cuisine will enjoy classic favourites as well as sophisticated reinterpretations of best-loved dishes. Sample the season’s best catches with JIN’s omakase menus, or enjoy an explosion of flavours in a complex myriad of textures with one of JIN’s ten signature chirashis. You don’t want to be missing out hamachi kama (or yellowtail cheek in English). It became our favourite immediately after we tasted it. It tastes best by grilling with some salt. The cheek we had was grilled to salty crisp on the outside yet firm on bite from the inside. The meat is so sweet and tender.If you want to try Saga beef in all its glory, be sure to visit JIN which serves the saga beef in many ways. For something more traditional, go for the chargrilled saga beef sprinkled with fried garlic. Marbled to perfection, Saga Beef forms a beautiful pattern of pure-white fat weaving in and out of soft, red muscle. The sweet, rich flavored meat is a tribute to Saga’s mild climate, delicious water and clean air

Had a great omakase menu. A pleasure to look at and a pleasure to eat! Had a good chat to Chef Thomas who explained a bit about the menu and ingredients as well as a lesson in the best order to eat sushi to maximise the flavours
