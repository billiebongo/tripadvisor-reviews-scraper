Best value and taste for Singaporean Chinese food . A good place for tourist and back packers in the Japan besar area to use this restaurant as a good sample of local Chinese food.

Chicken Rice is delicious, but it is quite pricey as it looks be restaurant not be street food. Suitable for family or friends.

Overpriced chicken rice. Would encourage tourists to visit the hawker centres for a more reasonably priced plate of chicken rice. For the same price, Boon Tong Kee nearby would be a better bet.

My partner and I were searching for a place nearby our hotel in Little India and were pleased with our choice.The host was very friendly and he brought our boiled peanuts coated in some sauce which was really delicious! We had not had peanuts served that way before but it was a nice way to start the meal. We were not super hungry so we split a portion of the roasted Hainanese chicken rice which came with a small soup for each of us. The chicken was really tender and it was a perfect portion for a very light dinner. We also had the fresh lime juice which was very refreshing and not too sweet.We had great service with a smile for a very good price

This place serves Hainanese chicken rice, both white/boiled and roasted. Very authentic and rice is cooked to fragrant perfection, not soggy or too dry. Chicken is lightly moist and retains its original taste, texture and freshness. This restaurant serves other local Chinese dishes like fried noodles, Hor fun, stir fried vegetable, curry vegetable, etc. Repeat customer

Was wandering around when I stumble upon this little gem of a chicken rice restaurant. The chicken, rice , soup all score full marks in my opinion. Although a little pricey about $5.50 for a single person potion of chicken. It's well worth the money. Much better then the other much well known chicken rice restaurants in Singapore . Will be back for sure!

After visiting some Hindu temples we started to look for a place to have lunch and a drink. Several restaurants were in the area, but all of them were closed. Finally we found a Chinese restaurant, The Yang's Traditional Hainanese... . Obviously it was very popular since a lot of Chinese families were having lunch there.We thought it is good sign.My companion chose a Tom yum gong soup and myself Shark fin with crab meat soup. After we shared a Vietnamese So tong.Everything was all right, but only all right. I mean it was a food that calms down your hunger, but doesn't give you any particular culinary pleasure. The Vietnamese So tong was the best, that was the dish, which I can praise.The most enjoyable part of the lunch was the ginger tea.The service was fast and attentive. The prices were a bit higher than the quality of the food

We were touring Indian temples near Race Track Road in Little India but didn't find any open restaurants except Indian Vegetables. We walked back along Serangoon Road (the main street) and noticed The Yang;s Chinese restaurant was not only open but packed. Nevertheless they found us a place for two and we had a lot of very good food. I had Tom Yam Seafood soup with Chicken Rice and lime juice to drink while my partner had a chinese dish I can't read from the recipt with ginger tea. They also brought us peanuts and wet tissues which they charged for. The peanuts were not roasted so we thought they were beans but they were tasty. My soup was very good, lots of seafood. The bill was S$50 including a 10% surcharge that I assume was like a tip. The service was excellent. We would go back for sure
