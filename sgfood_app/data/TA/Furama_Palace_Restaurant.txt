The restaurant does a very nice buffet. All sorts on the menu, something for everyone. Fantastic breakfast too.

We had breakfast and dinner here. Really good with so much choice And the ommelettes at breakfast were so good cooked while you waited.
3
The location was great, the private room where we had lunch was great, the service was beyond approach but the food was below my expectations. The Chinese vegetables was too salty and the Peking duck not as crispy as I would have liked.

The food is amazing. From cold seafood to curries to snack food o desserts, you couldn't ask for more in fact so much food laid out for you buffett style you just didn't know where to start.

One of the best hotel in Chinatown.It is in the city centre and accessible to all the beautiful attractions in Singapore.Friendly staff as well.

We ate lunch a la cart and the burger and sandwich we had were poor. This is not what the kitchen does best.

We were only able to enjoy the breakfast buffet, as out touring every day. Breakfast included food for every ethnic group. Quality of food was above average
3
There are not much for vegetarians and had a tough time in choosing a dish for me. Also the vegetarian ordinary meal costs around 20 singapore dollars. Even around the hotel the choices for vegetarians are limited.

Some food was OK but most targeted to Asian appetite. It did state it was International but not so. give it a miss

Breakfast buffet was quite good with a reasonable level of variety. Hot food could have been a bit hotter. Evening buffet variety was quite good too but it was expensive for a buffet (160 singapore dollars for two people) that did not include alcohol.

Like the Japanese foods as well as other asian cusines available on the table. The service is good and accomodating

Found the food alright considering it was Singapore. The buffet however does niot change through out the day.

Breakfast spread is excellent, one can choose American Breakfast of go for authentic oriental serve. Staff is very courteous

Furuma restaurant is below average due to the poor menu and repeated dishes everyday. Seating arrangement is like an outdoor street seats and no proper service. Felt the staff was inexperienced or lot of ego due to long time with Furuma.
4
Variety of food was good, but the dinner buffet closes early at 10 pm and if you are late then there is already waiters clearing the buffet table.
5
I like seafood. And here I found good rotation of seafood. And meal was very tasty. But tables are too small in my opinion.

Love food there especially at the Executive Lounge where you can always find warmest hospitality of staff.

We stayed at the Furama Hotel in Chinatown where our partner has an office. In previous visits we favoured Orchard based hotels because of proximity to upscale and mid-scale shopping places.After having breakfast at Tiffany's we decided to take our dinner at the restaurant and the next morning, we had to just take coffee. fruits and orange juice because dinner was superb and it takes more than 6 hours to digest
