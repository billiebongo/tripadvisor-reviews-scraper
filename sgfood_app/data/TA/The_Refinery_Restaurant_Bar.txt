Love the ambience of the restaurant. Their yakitori was nice and grilled to almost perfection. The appetizer was good as well. Will go back again for more!
4
Food is delicious and ambience is fine... Great place to chill out. Outside CBD zone, public parking available nearby. 6-8pm happy hours for beer lovers.
4
Nice place to get together with a bunch of friends. The food is tasty and the service is superb. I will definitely come back here again!
5
Love the atmosphere, service and food. Ambience was awesome!! Love the drinks too. Will definitely go back for the bar food!
3
Perhaps I came at the wrong time of the day, the restaurant looked very dark and dull at night. Portions were small and very pricey.
4
Enjoyed my visit there . The food was good and the staff was really friendly. She advised on the food options. Loved the coffee baller
4
Luckily we were there 3 minutes before the restaurant opens for business. We didn’t have a reservation, but was lucky to get a table indoor for two. The place was filled up fast during lunch time. I had the salted egg onion rings and spicy mee, they were delicious but I couldn’t finish the onion rings despite sharing it with my husband because the portion of the mains was pretty generous. My spicy mee was covered with spicy minced meat. The noodles were springy and just the right level of sauciness.Parking the car was a little troublesome because the parking lots around the restaurant are limited. Do come early to avoid the horde of lunch crowd
3
Ordered mocha which is thick and nice. The chicken burger on the other hand is good but the price is slightly high.
3
Food was decent, above average.Service was efficient and time taken to prepare was acceptable. The indian waitress was very courteous and attentive, always having a smile on. She deserve a commend:).I booked for 7 persons but somehow we had 11 person that showed up so we called for a extra seats and just happened to have extra seats as previous guest was about to leave. The restaurant was generous to allocate 4 more seats for us.But we left slightly disppointed because while we were enjoying our meal half way, one of the staff came over and told us that they impose a minimum spending of 25++ for 9 persons and above. Not that we are a cheapskate bunch, but i think the restaurant should take a look at our orders before telling us. Each of us had a main course and we ordered double side dishes for the long table. The bill came up to about 25 dollars short of the total minimum spending. We didn't want to make it look ugly and just ordered 2 desserts just to close the tab. I mean come on, minmum spending ? Really ? Not like we are seating there for 3-5 hrs just hogging on to one drink each. I believe the restaurant doesn't implement this for groups of more than 9 people who is just drinking away on happy hours right? U will only drive ur customers away. Or maybe u do?Management should reconsider their policy and look into the double standards if there is. But still, Thank you for hosting us

Went to try their lunch menu after reading very good reviews. Teriyaki chicken don was below expectations, rice was quite hard and not the soft japanese rice as stated in the menu description. Coffee was not bad, The waffle was not as good as before. Service was quite prompt but then the cafe was not crowded
5
Always love coming back to refinery for their berry waffles. Spot on. :) the staff are so friendly and they ensure you’re well taken care of during your dining experience.
4
Food was good and group/ baby friendly. Menu was extensive so we had good variety. Service pretty fast too.
5
2nd time here. Had the teriyaki chicken bowl, kalechips and kiss of love yakitori. Food and service were great. Felt relaxed being here on a weekday night away from the bustle of town.
4
My family and I had brunch at The Refinery to celebrate my sister's birthday. We had a good time there. I look forward to my next visit there.
5
The place to go for afforable and extremely good rice bowls! The atmosphere is great for gatherings too; thumbs up!
5
The Refinery is one of Singapore's most original eateries. Eclectic menu with fusion Japanese bowls and bites that make for great grazing. Complemented by a good Saké and Japanese whisky list, with Asahi dry and black on tap; together with a great high ceiling dining room that is rustic and very creative. What more can you ask?
3
Due to the design of the restaurant, the sound keep bouncing off the walls and so it’s really a noisy place for lunch. Kale chips are oily and horrible tasting and should be removed from the menu
4
This was my 2nd visit & i was glad with the consistency in both your food & service level. I've brought my friends there this time & they were happy overall too. The only setback is one of your staff took my mobile phone to the back of your counter to record the chope voucher number in your system during settling of bills but forgotten to return it to me. When I left & went back shortly after to look for my phone, it was just lying around on the cashier counter 'unattended' meaning anybody could have just taken it
4
Having been directed here on recommendation from our hotel - we turned up late and the place was very quiet, so we were was not sure if this was a good sign. As it turned out, people tend to eat fairly early and so we were eating after most people had finished. Not really knowing our way round the Asian fusion menu, we ended up ordering a mix of dishes to share and boy where they good. So much so we returned the following night to try the other half of the dishes that we had not tried the first night - these were just as good. The beef wrapped foir gras skewers were melt in the mouth goodness, as was the pork belly lollie pops
2
My husband and I both had the mushroom risotto. It tasted lovely and had a very rich buttery mushroom flavor. The cafe itself looked very trendy and the staff were quite polite. Unfortunately the mushroom risotto was very small for the $18 price tag. I could have eaten about 3 and had to go and eat some more food elsewhere. I hope in future you are able to increase the portion size especially as risotto is not too difficult to cook in bulk in an industrial kitchen. Thank you.
4
I had teriyaki donburi for lunch. The food and service were good. About 2 blocks away from lavender mrt.
3
Refine the refinery. Love the coffee baller, its a winner! The food was average and the shiok burger in all honesty wasn’t shiok. The salted egg yolk sauce was bland and not thick enough. The chicken patty lost out to mc spicy chicken and if I am paying more the mcdonalds, I expect it to be better. Truffle fries are better than average as the flavour comes through. Service was understaff and just average really. Overall a good place to come for the decor, drinks and food.
4
Went here for a light dinner and drinking ! Enjoyed the environment and of course their daily happy hour! We ordered some finger food like salted egg onion rings and kale chips to share. Kale chips were quite oily..Food was okay, and staff were nice. But it was quite warm that day, not sure if they turned on all the air conds The price was decent ! And I wish they could have more choices in the dessert menu as they only have waffles. Overall experience was great! Will definitely return again!
5
1st time at Refinery! Their GYUDON did not disappoint! The Salted Ehg Onion Rings is also yummy! (a must order) their praline mocha was also good! But don’t order th waffles as it was a miss! Overall, love the ambience of the restaurant :) Will definitely come back :
4
Was quite sad that we were unable to try the yakitori platter that day, but about an hour plus into the meal I saw a table behind us being able to order yakitori despite them saying that their grill was down. Sad, but otherwise, just about everything else is fine, except maybe the kyoto mousse is a little too much in feeling 'gelat'
3
food was so so. service was also so so. we were supposed to celebrate a friend's birthday. The staff instead of bringing out the cake with candle lit, they just passed us the whole cake with the box. It was just awkward.
5
If you like salted eggs... this is the place to go. We shared the salted eggs onion rings and the shiok burger that had salted egg sauce on it too and it was great. I like the fact that it wasn't too crowded either. Loved the decor!
3
I've been following their instagram for quite awhile and have been very keen on trying The Refinery out. Upon arrival, I was really drawn by the chic interior decorative of the restaurant. However, as much as this place is instagramable, the food didn't really match up. In terms of value, the lunch set was rather reasonable - the only let down was just the food. I had the pork don, it was rather disappointing. The cut of the meat (I'm assuming it's loin) lacked fats thus, without the right skills the meat eventually came out to be really dry. Flavour of the sauce was average too. For the sharing bites, I had the taste of the salted egg onion rings and truffle fries. Pretty average. The wasabi mayo that came with the truffle fries was really good though - had a great kick of wasabi. However, with the seaweed and wasabi I feel like the truffle essence didn't pull through? Could've just used without it and made it just 'japanese fries'. Lastly, salted egg onions. Great idea but could be better executed with a lighter batter. So would it be worth a second trip? Urm, maybe. Just to try out their coffee though, I'd pass the food.
3
The sides we ordered, cheese fries and onion rings were not bad but the mains touted to be the bestsellers was not quite up to expectations. The beef, though well seasoned, was over-cooked. The eel wasn't anything to shout about. The nicest dish was the chili noodles.
2
Celebrated my husband's birthday here with a group of friends. Despite mentioning earlier to the management, nothing was done. I do understand that not all places accommodate to these, but not even one staff said happy birthday to him. The food was nothing of wow factor, and at a pricer end. They even forgot one of our friend's order which was the gyu-don and we thought it would take a longer waiting time to prepare. Eventually, we found out that it was left out and my poor friend had to wait for an even longer time while the rest of us had finish our food some time ago.
4
A lot of desserts are not available. Good atmosphere and valuable drinks selection during happy hour
4
tried the specials like laksa pasta that was quite nice but some items can be abit pricy. but overall good experience
4
Drinks with a kick and good food but small portions. Best dish of the night was probably the grilled eggplant
2
The food quality does not justify the price and service was terrible. We requested for a round of water and the same request had to be repeated thrice before 1 glass was served.
4
Asian fusion food served. Dessert is good too. Nice decors and great ambience for gatherings and a night of catch ups.
4
Nice wine with excellent service! Good for friends gathering. Food is average and desserts was good.
5
Friendly staffs! Was given free shots for my friend's birthday, which was really nice! Laidback and chill atmosphere
5
The dons are great and tasty. The yakitoris are done well. Good selection of drinks as well. August promo for whiskey coffee.
4
First time visiting this cafe. Ordered the famous spicy Mee and refinery gyudon. The latter is well cooked and I can say amount of beef is 20% more than the rice!But the spicy Mee is kind of disappointing..feel like eating an ordinary bah chor Mee :
3
Visited The Refinery in June 2017, when it was still relatively new and somewhat unknown. We were surprised by the nice exterior and interior of the place, the high ceiling made it really spacious for diners.However, I must say that the prices of the food did not justify the quality of the food which we were given. Moreover, there was 10% Service Charge and 7% GST Charge on top of the prices listed on the menu. The Refinery also charged $0.20 per cup of tap water...We really liked the concept of the place, however, it is likely that we will not be back there again.(Spent close to $110+ on 3 people, ordering 3 dons, 1 serving of truffle fries and 1 serving of unagi mentaiko gyoza
2
So disappointing. Wear flip flops and shorts to fit in. eat deep fried onion rings and cauliflower. Yockitori should be called Yucky-Tory.
Not clean, dust on walls. The food took forever to arrive. Very bad ventilation as well. I paid and got out.
5
excellent place to dine with clients, friends or family. The staff are relatively alert and the kitchen is accommodating to dietary requirements.
4
Tried the Refinery Don and Spicy Mee which were recommended on menu. Both were average tasting.. the yakiniku beef in the Don was overly cooked and tough, bowl was too heavily garlic tasting. The ambience is nice and service crew were attentive and polite.
3
Average food quality. Food on the steep side. Average spending $40-$50 per pax. Old food menu used to be better.
5
Staff were polite and helpful. Lots of initiative showed. I asked to switch tables twice and my request was carried out without any issues or unhappiness. It felt good to be in a place with such excellent service.
3
Decent and average. Impressive fusion of dishes but quality is average. Worth a try though. Excellent service and ambience.
3
Coffee could have been better. Chicken with waffle a bad choice. Waffle become sloggy after a while. Not much of salted egg yolk sauce on onion rings and burger.
4
Slightly pricy. Great food and atmosphere nonetheless. Service was quick and pleasant too. Just that they forgot my free appetiser when I booked with Chope promo!
3
Food places are in abundance locally. I am always more lenient with places that come with good service. We have spotted the place fully packed on multiple times passing by and had always wanted to try and find out why is it so packed. But we were lucky to arrive on a day when it was not fullhouse. Staff was friendly and welcoming. Would offer opinion on food choices when being asked. Food dishes did not knock us off the chair in the good or bad way, but was tasty enough within average range.Nice place to have a chit chat with friends or a romantic dinner in a quiet corner.Will definitely return
4
Visited on a sunday afternoon and the place was fully packed, with a lack of manpower. Nevertheless, the waiting time for food was considered reasonable and the staff was sincere in apologising for the inefficient service due to shortage of manpower. Ordered the lobster roll, okonomoyaki, mentaiko unagi gyoza and praline coffee baller. The lobster roll was my favourite, fresh lobster chunks in a soft buttery roll that's unfortunately only available on weekends. A free side of salted egg ebi via my reservation on chope was unfortunately a letdown, with a meagre amount of salted egg sauce and just two thin deep fried prawns for $10?!!! Unagi gyoza was a tad too salty for my liking and the mentaiko sauce did not quite complement it IMO. Nevertheless, the lobster roll, okonomoyaki and praline coffee baller are worth the try!
5
Really friendly staff with awesome food. I recommend the salted egg onion rings, refinery gyudon and chicken samurai platter. Their rice dons come with onsen eggs which I love.
4
Reasonably tasty. Very simple n dim place, perfect for a hang out session. Kitchen staff forgot about my preference but staff gave discount (only on that dish though!) Hidden bar at the back is super cool.
5
The Refinery is a good find. The lovely interior makes dining at the cafe a comfortable one. Food was also affordable and delicious!
5
Gyu Don served with mushrooms and egg is beyond tasty. Paired with my favourite coffee baller (praline flavoured), the meal is surprisingly filling and satisfying!
5
Absolutely love the beef bowl (gyudon) here! Brought more than 10 friends here to try it and they all came back for more!! The coffee baller is the bomb as well so make sure you try it!!
4
The Refinery has really great chill vibes with a spacious interior that ensures volume is not too loud for a nice night with friends! Service staff were great and will always render help with a smile. Didn't get to try that many food, but it was alright though not the best. Will definitely go back again for their happy hour deals
5
Popped in for a late lunch with family members who were visiting, one of whom is a fussy eater, but we all absolutely loved the Donburi bowls. Two of us had salmon, and one the pork, all three were extremely tasty. The service was very good and the team are very friendly. I have also been to the Refinery for a Sunday brunch (different menu) which was equally great.
1
Menu prices were increased at least 30 percent since last visit.Adding insult to injury, horrible food was not finished.Beef egg bowl now cost $25, ($29.25)Beef was overcooked, dry and tough.Bill was 245 for 6 persons, 41 per pax what a rip off.Free flow water is removed, now charge 0.2 for each tiny cup of water, non refillable.Come I clap for you
4
I like the hip industrial vibe that The Refinery has. The beef gyudon is good, the foie gras and onsen egg went well with the rice. However, the sliced rib-eye will a little too tough. The praline coffee baller is something unique. Will be back to try the lunch menu
2
We were a group of 6 and for most of us, it was our first time there. Naturally we had quite abit to eat because we wanted to try everything on the menu. Our bill came up to nearly $400. Being fans of Beef Bowls and seeing that the dish had a 2 thumbs up on The Refinery's menu, most of us decided to order the house recommendation for our mains - the Refinery Gyudon. Unfortunately, this turned out to be pretty dry for all of us. If you're expecting sous vide eggs that break to a molten lava of rich gooey yolk in your bowl, don't bother. The yolk was a hardened ball sitting atop clumped up chunks of shabu-shabu like beef which were ofcourse, also dry. Overall this dish was a major let down.To be fair however, service was great, and their sides and skewers were pretty good too. We enjoyed these much more than our mains. Would definitely recommend this place for an after work izakaya type of joint, with a pretty attractive 1for1 happy hour on wine and beer. Just don't bother trying the Earl Grey Gin & Tonic, because that just tasted like a glass of extremely watered down iced lemon tea
4
Great atmosphere for chilling with friends. Decent food, though was surprised to see that the brunch menu was significantly pricier than their dinner menu from our last visit 2 months back.
3
Love the ambience and atmosphere in the restaurant, but the food I would say it's average. I wish the don comes with better quality rice.
5
Loved the unagi and gyu yakiniku dons! Cauliflower fritters were good too. Waffle topped off the meal well!
4
Had Sunday lunch with my family of 6. Everything was good except the signature Refinery roll which was ordinary. The salted egg onion rings sounded much better than they tasted. Overall very pleasant visit. Good service !
5
Nice ambience, great food, great service! Serving of food was also fast. Will definitely visit there again !
3
Food was good. Staff was attentive. Venue is good very nice for gathering and dinner just that it can be alittle noisy due to the space. But all in all it was a good experience
4
The food was great and the ambience was perfect for talking. Only downside was the long wait for food.
3
I choose this restaurant because it's the closest one from my hotel that still open after 10:30pm.I have gyuniku donburi and assam tea while my wife has spicy ramen and earl grey tea.My gyuniku donburi is good enough but my wife's spicy ramen is not that good.This is a nice place really. The service is also good and fast.
5
We were looking for an unique place for the celebration. And found this place, that was highly recommended by my colleague. The customer service was excellent. I loved the food. The food quality did meet my expectation. And I can tell, they were sincere of how they prepared their food. Overall, worth the visit.
4
Stopped off for a drink and some snacks on a weekend afternoon.Location is opposite Aperia Mall, not much else around this industrial area.The ambience in Refinery was very "industrial" and cool. Great place to hang out for a while with indoor seating and few seats outside too.Great staff, very helpful and friendly, it was an enjoyable experience coming here.Had some cauliflower fritters which were awesome and an Asahi for refreshment.Quite busy for a weekend afternoon, people must know it is good. Will come again
3
The food is average, no value for money, but the service is good. It is a good place for drink and chill out after work.
4
The restaurant was well-decorated and had a perfect vibe for the end of the week. The food was decently-priced and was nice.
4
Some hits and misses for the food, but the salted egg onion rings were
good!
For a cafe, they are on the pricier side. Probably will not return any time soon.
5
Loved the yakiniku donburi. Skewers were good too! Couldn't stop munching on even their popcorn haha. Neh neh pops ended the meal on a good note.
4
The food was pretty good, though portions a little small.. The service was very good as they were very observant and extremely friendly
4
Tried a few of the recommended skewers and the wagyu beef don. Portions run small and are pricey for what you get so do note that when you order...
2
Just failed.Lot of items not available : no fresh juices (despite I did not see any on the other tables...) and the vegetables dishes.On the Menu, choice is limited with no healthy dishes.I took an espresso, one soda water and one classic egg Benedict. I was served within 3minutes but the Soda water glass (5sgd) was without bubbles (coming from an already opened bottle) and the bacon and muffins cold for at least 10 minutes.There is far better brunch places in the city
3
Skewers are cold, red wine in a bottle came with a reusable cork, not exactly sure whether its a fresh new bottle. The highly recommended gyuniku donburi is a total flop, the rice is dry and is nothing close to the traditional donburi's soft n fluffiness. Most food r served cold.
4
I visited The Refinery in September 2016 during a visit of Singapore, it was a short walk from our hotel (Hotel Boss) and provided a different local place for brunch. I visited with my partner, my cousin and her boyfriend and all of us were very happy with the food, service and setting. I ordered the waffle with bacon and ice cream and some sides of hash browns, which was all very tasty. I didn't think the place was any more expensive than anywhere else and we really liked the more local feel to the place in comparison to some other touristy areas.We found photos on Pinterest and were very glad we visited
4
Came on a Sunday morning for brunch â€” was one of the first few but found the place soon filling up decently. Not too crowded but not too quiet either, just enough activity to feel around us to enjoy our personal conversation but without feeling like the only ones. Had "The Epic" and it was really tasty and balanced, for some reason I found the foie gras to be slightly bland. Gf had the mushroom risotto and tbh this was salty and there was way too much parmesan cheese in it, could really dial back on the salt and cheese on this. Overall a very nice ambience but felt food could have been better given the price!
4
Portion was very huge for the confirm shiok double burger and lobster roll. The salted egg sauce went well with the crispy patty and there were chunks of lobster meat in the roll. Very satisfying meal!
4
food was great, portion was just right.. staff service was excellence. will recommend this place for chill out with friends.
4
Refinery burger was great! Of cos the waffle never disappoints us as usual! Service staff were attentive too.
5
Perfect....Great lunch and been here a few times.
Food portion is very good for sharing. A great place for chilling out and very cozy for gatherings.
4
the Bowls were nice! and the Gyuniku Donburi was nice except that the rice was a bit hard, probably not cooked well. ordered the sides wings and quail eggs.
5
Great food great portions great ambience Loved the vibes of the restaurant and how quickly the food was served
4
It is a great place to eat, drink and hang out with friends. Love the Coffee Baller and side dishes!
4
Hidden in a quaint area of light industries and former hardware stores, this restaurant has a high ceiling, open bar and has an amazing ambience to dine and chill. Serving Japanese fusion cuisine in small plates which are great for sharing over drinks, it is often filled even on weeknights
4
First time for brunch and not evening drinks. Very bright space, open.Staff is ok. Might be a bit more attentive. The shiok burger is too sweet, the custard sauce is not matching so well. I understand the link between the local culture and the taste but I think it does not work. The normal burger is amazing. I love the ice ball coffee with hot milk. Very good and strong coffee taste. The ice creams in desert are top top. Onions rings are perfect. The Japanese beef bowl is amazing too. Price is well. It's not expensive not cheap.The selection of drinks at evening is also very good. I recommend to pay a visit.
4
Chance upon it when I'm nearby chilling out.. Found it to be quite unique coz if you don't look in details, you properly won't even realize it's an eatery place.Food mainly some sharing plate & skewers.. Portion is great for sharing, place is cozy & great for gathering & chilling out.The Salted Egg Onion Ring is a must to order.. Been long while since I got to eat real deep-fried onion which they did it not too oily & yet it's crispy. Califlower fritters is another to try. Loved the wasabi dip that comes with it
3
The food is okay. Location is very quaint. Ample carparking space. Overall a rather pleasant experience.
4
Excellent food, affordable prices, wonderful ambience.
Service wise was okay. The place starts to get real crowded at dinner time. Make sure to make a reservation before heading there. About 10-15 mins walk from lavender station.
4
Great portion and good value. Nice atmosphere as well. There's a good variety of choices and coffee was very good!
3
Not many choices on the menu, some of the dishes are quite salty. Overall a nice place to meet up with friends.
4
Tucked in an industrial/residential area... its' a cool chillout place. Friendly and attentive staff.
5
The service was quite good! the salted egg yolk onion rings is a definite must order! The donburi is quite good too!
4
The food taste nice. Will definitely bring more friend to try. The staff is friendly as well. Like the atmosphere too
4
Seaweed truffle fries were rly good but such a pity they ran out of the coffee baller since that's what I came here for!
4
The truffle bowl was great, not so much a fan of the refinery bowl as the flavours were a little overwhelming. Loved the quail eggs and the skewers. A little noisy inside but otherwise, happy with the friendly service!
3
Kitchen was severely understaffed. Took 45 mins for my food to arrive and we had to cancel dessert and a side because we were pressed for time (working lunch after all). Irate tables all around while the poor hapless waiters could only hover anxiously around a single cook in the kitchen or effusively apologizing to diners. If you play Diner Dash, this would be one of those situations where every table is in red and you may as well restart the game because it looks like a hopeless situation. Except this was in real life and I really feel sorry for the staff. Next time, would be good if you can perhaps warn diners of the long wait before taking their orders in order to manage expectations or offer some form of service recovery. Hungry people are never the most gracious people after all.
4
I love the food and ambience here. Good place to hang out with big groups of friends. They have nice long tables. It is quite packed in the evenings. Recommend!!
4
Fast serving. Good food but portion is too small. I love the ambient alot. It is very spacious and quiet. Worth the try.
4
Skewers on the pricey side, but bowls are affordable and delicious. (Tried all 3!) Salted egg onion rings are a must!
3
Good and tasty food but does not come cheap. Ambience is nice so good for date nights or entertainment.
5
I love the food there. This is my second time. My friend is here for the first time and likes to come here again.
4
Nice to come with friends and to share food, atmosphere is nice and service is good.
However I wouldn't come for a romantic evening!
5
Good dining concept. Not too far away from the MRT station. Excellent service and good food. Will definitely come back again. :)
4
Cosy eatery and bar. The 3+1 offer for many drinks was a steal! Service is prompt, and the people are friendly!
4
Went on a Sunday for brunch, place was crowded and since it is enclosed, noise level is quite high. Staff were busy but service was pleasant. Food is mostly above 20 but can be shared. Would love to go back to try the weekday lunch menu
4
Arranged to meet and have business lunch here. I was early and reached before the opening hours. The crew was warm and friendly, allowing me to be seated indoors to wait. Good Jap fusion food and great ambience as there is coffee and hot drinks without having to switch venue again. Will def return
4
Friendly staff. Ordered the shiok burger and the beef burger. Would recommend if the cafe gives their customer the autonomy to choose small, Med, large portion for their truffle fries..
4
I love the rice bowls and the atmosphere was great! Went there slightly before lunch and the service was good.
5
i was not expecting to be wowed by the food given the name- but it punched well above its price point for presentation and quality.
4
Love the ambiance there! good place to catch up with friends or have a date! a tad pricey but food is nice! :)
4
Food and ambience was good. As the venue is enclosed, place is rather noisy. Conversation need to raise our voice.
4
Food was great, I love the skewers and beef bowl. Also tried the spicy ramen. Only downside was some of the dishes were just a little too salty. Portions could be a little bigger! Overall, nice place and great food!
5
Two of our favourite are the salted egg onion rings and fried cauliflower!! We are also amazed how the refinery waffle can look so pretty and taste just as pretty. The staffs are attentive and they will refill your water and clear your plates frequently.
3
Its a nice cozy little place with nice ambience. We has Seaweed Truffle Fries - but i like it crisp - it was rather soggy. Salted egg yolk calamari - it was ok. Unagi don - u wld be able to find it anywhere else i feel. Overall its alright.
4
The Dons were AMAZING. Had the Gyuniku Donburi (Tare Marinated Ribeye, Truffle Hon Shimeiji Mushrooms) & Buta Shobayaki Don (Caramelized Pork Loin with Ginger Glaze), which were $12++ & $10++ respectively. Additional Onsen Egg at $3++ a pop. Pretty affordable & SUPER yummy. I read some reviews that portions are small-- I disagree; these were sufficiently filling. Both indoor (air-conditioned) & al fresco seats are available. I love the interior decor; high ceiling makes it spacious & surprisingly not echo-ey. Good to have a chat with your dining buddy.Also ordered the Cauliflower Fritters ($10++) appetizer, which wasn't too oily... It comes with a wasabi mayo dip TO DIE FOR. You can really feel the spicy sting.... Woohoo!I made my reservation using the Chope app, & also bought vouchers from their website. Very fuss-free experience; I will definitely return
3
Had a try of their unagi don, skewers, salted egg onion rings and their 1 for 1 red wine, friends had the Gyuniku Donburi. The salted egg onion rings was they only disappointment though which looked so bright yellow and great for instagram and facebook, but the taste didn't really live up to the hype. Quite satisfied with the unagi don which was mouth-watering, and the efficient service.
4
My first time at The Refinery! Enjoyed the friendly service, yummy food and good atmosphere! I'll be back!
5
I'm really in love with this place really chill n cozy,would definitely bring more friends to come back here again.
4
Had lunch with friends. Beef don was delicious. Waffle and coffee was good too. Good value. Will recommend this place.
3
Ate a beef rice bowl and couple of skewers. After a while, all the food taste pretty much the same as we guess the sauce used for the skewers are the same.
3
The place looks great. Esp if you love the industrial style, this plc is good to chill. Food wise is just ok.. instagram worthy but taste and price is average for me...
4
Like sitting at the high table/chair, should have a few more high table/chair inside the restaurant. Lunch time crowd is decent, should lower down the music.
4
Dropped in after work to check out this eatery. The decor and ambience was a surprise given the location with it hardware and light industries. Service was friendly and fast even with 75% capacity. What u get is tapas size bites although the Rice dish was decent. We enjoyed our meal and will be our goto place if we are around the area.

Food is so-so.Used to be good but business got better and their customer service deteriorated. The irony thing is that it is the boss (highly likely) who is rude and arrogant.I was standing at the counter waiting for my bill for at least 5mins, hence was staring at the receipt in front of me, asking whether is that my receipt. He gave me that nasty "obviously not yours" look and replied:"No". I won't visit this place again. My friends complained about the similar guy's attitude too. Customer service is very important especially your food standard is so-so

Went with my family and ordered their ricebowls, skewers etc. Love their beef ricebowl, the portion is not big and leave you craving for more. My kids preferred the unagi ricebowl. The onsen eggs added flavour to the ricebowls indeed. The other popular item on the table was the salted egg onion rings and 'chicken high' skewer- delicious. We ended up spending about $40 plus per pax as we ordered some beers and martini too. Overall a good meal in nice atmosphere.
5
We went there today early to beat the rush. Food was great. We had refinery roll (Lobster) which was great with big chunks of lobster. Coffee was also special. Loved it. Will go back for sure. Total price for 2 refinery rolls and 2 coffees was $70. So not cheap but well worth it
4
It's a nice place to hang out with friends. The drinks are ok. The food - Order the salted egg onion rings! Gyuniku donburi!!
4
We were a group of 4 and managed to get happy hour drinks ($7 for a glass of wine before 8pm). We loved the meat lovers skewers platter, salted egg onion rings, brussel sprouts and cauliflower fritters.
4
It was a nice place to chill and dine. The staffs are nice and polite. It can be a nice place for big group gathering.
5
I expected the food to be good but the food was even better it was amazing !!!!! Service is good too :-) Would go back again and again
4
Salted egg yolk onion rings . A must order dish when you are at refinery. Nice cosy place, good for after work drinks , place very big but rather crowded.
5
It was my second trip to The Refinery and this time we ordered the Beef Donburi Rice Bowl and it was awesome. Service was also excellent as the staff made sure everything was up to scratch.
10/10 would go again :)
4
My partner and I had dinner here on our first night in Singapore. The food is very nice and the drinks are great. Staff are friendly. Only negative is they don't seem to know how to pour a beer correctly (they have way too much head). Other than that, fantastic :
5
My wife and I had an early Saturday evening dinner at the Refinery. Cool interior with high ceilings - we were happy to be seated at a round table near the walls as the central tables were quite crowded and close together. Service was excellent and the cocktail menu very nice - $10 happy hour for some nice handmade cocktails -specialty is martinis of all kinds. The highlight is the food - main menu consists mostly of different meats done yakitori-style. Highlights were the chicken thighs as well as the lamb - everything we tried was excellent. Was not a perfect meal but i feel it's worth 5 stars anyways, just because of how good the main course food was - it was some of the best grilled skewers we've had anywhere. things that could have improved: - service after the main dishes was poor - we ordered a dessert which never arrived. Had to wait for a long time before finally flagging a waiter down starfish-style for the bill. - we are probably not the target market - definitely a hipster vibe going on - will try to grow my beard longer before returning :) Overall you'll enjoy this place if you like:- great handmade cocktails- excellent and unusual grilled meat skewers- a trendy hipster vibeWe will definitely return
4
High ceilings and a clean black and white color scheme makes for a great relaxing environment to chill over Sunday brunch. This place serves a yummy brunch menu on weekends. The salted egg yolk chicken burger is delicious, with a generous portion of fried chicken thighs and salted egg yolk sauce that's not too rich. The side serving if truffle fries compliments the burger perfectly. Coffee is good and weekend happy hour drinks are a plus too, albeit the draft beer seemed a bit weak. There are loads of other brunch options on the menu which look equally enticing so we'll definitely be back
3
I'm not a coffee drinker, but I hear they have good coffee here. Their instagram feed is beautiful and almost makes me want to drink coffee. I first went here with a friend in search of their coffee ball - they freeze coffee into a ball and serve it in a glass with hot milk poured over it. I saw that they recently added a decaf version too. I can't speak to the taste of the coffee - just its beauty, but I did try some food, and it wasn't great, to be honest. I tried the beef don (twice - once on a weekday and once at brunch on Saturday), the hambagu and the mushroom risotto. The beef don is by far the best. On weekends, it costs more ($25) and comes with a small piece of seared foie gras. The hambagu was $26 and left more to be desired, though the fries were pretty good. The risotto was very salty and had a bit of an artificial cheese taste. I also tried the salted egg yolk onion rings, and let me just say that as yummy as salted egg yolk is, it really doesn't belong on everything. I'd go back for the beef don, but that's about it so far. The ambience is pretty cool, set in an industrial building, so it's perfect for your hipster hangout, but sadly not so great as a restaurant as far as food goes
3
Tried the skewers platters and they were delicious especially the 'shiok bak'. However, we find that the chicken skewers were alil on the saltier side. Their cookie martini and coffee iceballer are innovative and yet good!
4
We enjoyed the variety of food and coffee. In particular, the Don bowl, burger and lobster roll were yummy! For coffee, we liked the coffee baller as it was rich and aromatic. No complaints on the service rendered too.
4
Food was amazing but even though I made a reservation, was made to share a table when there were other empty seats when I arrived. Nonetheless, would definitely go back for the 4th time!
5
mom's first visit. Though I'll bring her to a hip cafe for dinner. I remembered this place from my previous visit thru a friend's recommendation. Thumbs up from my mom
5
Served the salted popcorn at the start which was really good! Onion ring with salted egg was outstanding! The rice bowl and ramen were extremely value for money given the quantity and quality!
4
Quality of foods are very good. Same with the atmosphere. Definitely will be back to try different food there.
4
This is my usual lunch place if we need to go for lunch with our team. I like it that they change the ambience for the evening time.
4
Good place to chill with your friends. Truffle fries and Salted egg York onion rings was the boom! Elderflower martini tasted like cough syrup to me
1
No info anywhere indicating that they have 2 different menus, weekday lunch & weekend brunch. We went down wanting to try their value for money lunch rice bowls with good reviews on Burpple.Overpaying for lousy food. Overpriced beef bowl with foie gras (no option to exclude this but still need to pay for this) & lobster roll was not fresh, can taste it from the first bite. First & last time! Disappointing..
4
Went for a birthday celebration and the food we had was overall very nice. We had yakitoris, 2 kinds of fries ( go check out), dons, etc and ended with popsicles and delicious waffles. I would have rate it higher at 5 if not for the noise and the 'too dim' feel. I am someone who likes to see what's on my plate to appreciate the nice display and food colours.
4
Great time with mine family. Love their Meat Platter and their Truffle Fries ... Service Assistance is Helpful and understanding..
3
good location and interesting food selection! Love the duo chocolate drink and my onsen egg rice bowl
5
The service and place was great but unfortunately the food fell flat. Had the salted egg yolk onion rings, poutine fries, skirt steak, meatballs, pork belly and unagi don.
3
I ordered the Refinery Roll, which costs $25. Topped up $2 for Truffle Fries. Disappointed that there was so little fries. Would have also preferred a more fried/toasty bun. Looks better than it tastes. Was not filling.
4
Lunch was decent with their set menus. Tried the beef signature don with soft cooked egg which was good to the very last bit.
4
Appreciate if they can extend their lunch menu on weekends to provide more options or more choice for chicken/vegan as majority under mains are beef choice.
4
I very much like this place for a after-work drinks. Cool design, nice selection of beer/drinks and ok bar food.
5
Thoroughly pleased with the staff for their attentiveness and service. The food was yummy in the tummy! Will definitely go back for more!
4
the cafe offers interesting fingerfood choices like grilled egg plants, seaweed truffles fries (would be good with stronger truffles), agedashi tofu also too greenie. Possible to exclude those greenies on every dishes. kinda too over. The refinery waffles is GOOD and pretty.
5
The food are yummY! The staffs are friendly and helpful. However, the dinner menu was not as extensive. Went for the brunch menu before. I prefer the lunch menu more!! The skewers are yummy but the serving is small. Tried the new chicken soft bones, didnt know that its really only bones lols. fault on us though.
5
I enjoy the portion of the food served! Allowed us to have more variety & value for $$. Nice Ambience
5
i usually go for dinner menu and this is my first time doing the brunch . the food was fantastic.. the lobster roll was great !!! oh very enjoyable session i had with friends.
totally try the beef bowl, lobster roll!
4
Lovely decor and ambience in the middle of an industrial area.
Food is decently priced and tasty. Service is prompt and portions are neat. Would recommend this place for hangouts after work for drinks/food.
3
The Refinery has an interesting ambiance. Unfortunately, only the Spicy Mee was delicious. I have ordered the Refinery Bowl and Cheesy Poutine. But none made it to my liking. Service crew were friendly and polite.
4
Gd service, the staff was very attentive. The design concept of the restuarant was unique and food was delicious.
3
Was pleasantly surprised with this place. Needed somewhere to sit quietly and work, which I could here.
The Green Apple juice was amazing, as was the eggs Benedict, wasn't a fan of the poutine fries though.
Overall, lovely place.
4
Pleasant hipster cafe that is not too noisy and claustrophobic. Food is nicely done, service is also good.
4
A cosy restaurant where you can chat and chill without pressure. Really love their Salted Egg Onion Rings & Gyuniku Donburi with Onsen Tamago, only disappointment is that they are not using the japanese pearl rice. Hence, the rice was a little hard/dry. Meat Lovers was nice, their chicken skewer was better than the wagyu rib eye though. Overall, good experience & food was serve promptly. I will definitely come back again
3
Salted onion rings are good the rice Dons are not. Rice is too dry and hard - almost indigestible. This is my 2nd time having the same eel don there in the month and the consistency of food quality is highly questionable. And for an overly staffed restaurant, the service speed is slow
5
The staff is accommodating and helpful, even if they do get some things wrong from time to time (can't blame them though - we were a group of 14 people!)/ The food is the real highlight... poutine is to die for, meat skewers are moist, juicy and flavourful, wasabi fries - yum!This was my third visit to the Refinery and it certainly won't be the last
5
Refined experience making reservations at The Refinery! Definitely hassle free and i was actually 50-50 on the confirmation but glad that it went through.
5
loved the salted egg yolk onion rings and yakiniku don! Another must try is the tskune balls, agedashi tofu and seaweed fries. skip the chicken wings
2
Ordered the following items:- Lobster Roll - taste was sour and weird, bun was dry. - Wagyu beef bowl - beef was dry and hard- Eggs benedicte - just barely passable- Iced long black + latte - such weak coffee, too much milkFlavors were just lacking, and for somewhere with such great interiors, we were wondering why there was even a queue when the food was bland and not good! Especially for the prices, it was definitely not worth our while. I wouldn't come back at all, plus the wait staff seemed disinterested in their jobs and were really confused about bookings for almost every guest that came in.
3
I visited with my family of three young kids for dinner. Service was prompt and polite. However, the food portions were small and consequently not value for money. We found the food tasty but perhaps too salty as we found ourselves having to gulp down several cups of water during the meal. On the whole, we found it slightly overrated
4
It had been quite awhile since I last visited the place. The menu had changed alot from what I last had. Besides the bar bites, the place also offers brunch menu during the weekend. It was recommended that reservation had to be made as the place get crowded during weekends. The place was easy to find as it was just a street away from the MRT station.The place was decorated in dark industrial look way. Although there was no service charge on the bill, there was GST on the bill. Remember to help yourself to the ice water on the shelf.COFFEE BALLER ($8.50+)Macadamia Flavoured Espresso Ice Ball served with warm milkBeware of the hot milk when pouring into the glass. It was a refreshing drink to have and one could adjust the richness of the drink to own's taste.Katsuo Butter Sprouts ($12+)Brussel Sprouts, Katsuo Butter, Roasted AlmondsIt looks simple, but it was filled with sweet, juicy, and nutty texture.Mac & Cheese Refined ($10+)Emmental, Cheddar, Mozzarella Cheese, Crispy BreadcrumbsBest had it while it was still hot and moist, else it became quite hard and dry. It was a cheese lover's favourite.The Refinery Zhng Burger EVM ($18+)Crispy Double Chicken Cutlets, Slow-Grilled Brioche Burger Buns, Overdose of Signature Refinery Salted Egg Sauce, Served with Truffle Fries.This item was available only for 3 July. I got to know about it when I saw the picture of it on instagram the day before. The dish took quite awhile to arrive. The truffle fries smelt great with the truffle oil smell, and was dry and crispy. The chicken cutlet was big in size, but would be better if it was a bit more juicy and overflowed with more sauce. I like my burger juicy and dripping with sauce.The salted egg sauce that served with it, was thick and rich, more like a paste.Overall the food was not bad. The place was crowded but not too noisy
5
Have been bringing different friends to try their delish don. I absolutely love their steak don, and salted egg onion rings. Their coffee baller's interesting, worth a try. I found the flavor Praline too sweet. Perhaps I'll try the Vanilla next time. Atmosphere is great, service staff are amazing too
3
Food tastes just alright, would expect that standard for the price it charges. The skewer is too tiny a piece. Would visit just for the salted egg onion rings, nothing else worth making the trip for. Service is much lacking. I had a reservation and the staff simply pointed me to the table, did not show me to the table. Waiter was not able to answer simple question on the menu.
5
We went to meet colleagues for lunch at this place, and chose this for its central location. Housed in a converted industrial shophouse, the place had plenty of great sunlight, and the ambience was amazing. The menu didn't have that much variety, but whatever that was on it, was perfect. It was a mix of Western, Japanese and Singaporean fusion food, and we enjoyed every bit of it. The wine selection and coffees, again, were lacking in variety, but the ones we tried were amazing, so it's not that big a deal. Go during weekday afternoons, if you don't like crowded areas. I'd recommend making a reservation too, just in case
5
Unexpected place where they serve modern good food and drinks! Nice music, nice people and nice staff in a very friendly spirit on a nice terrasse. Honestly it is a must in Singapore even if it is more or less in the suburbs. For sure next trip to Singapore will bring me to this place again!
3
When i reached the place, the atmosphere was really good and the service was good too. The waitress was kind and efficient. It was a bonus for me when they served popcorn for free and it was a unique flavour at that. However, when the food came, i was disappointed as the portion of the food was quite small. I feel that the portion of the dish is small (it was only one small bowl) and not filling, especially at that price. PS: I bought the Unagi Don for $10 during their dinner period.
4
The waffle was fluffy and has a nice coffee fragrance. The ambience was great for couples as well as catching up with friends!
4
Situated away from the crowded central area, it provides a better environment for us to relax and have a good chat. The food is decent and relatively cheaper than most of the restaurants.
4
Both my friend and my food tasted good. We tried gyudon & foie gras and cowboy burger. It was delicious. Serving size can be a little big for 1 pax. Artistic environment. WIll go back and try other food there again.
4
Warehouse style development, really tasty food, we went for the meat platter and it was really good especially the chicken hearts. You have to have the quails' eggs too, they're amazing!
5
We ordered the Refinery waffles and the beef rice. The food was really great. Service was excellent too
3
The Refinery Wings tasted not bad, but both my girlfriend and I feel that it is kind of bland.
It would be good if more seasonings are added when marinating.
Like the crisp of it.
3
We went over for a company lunch, which is like 9 of us during 1pm lunch time. My boss was telling how good the food was, and she has been there for a few times before, apparently upon our arrival, the restaurant was packed, and it's super noisy (echo) as it's a high ceiling restaurant. All of us order Gyuniku Donburi, it stated that the rice with truffle oil - but nothing happened. The store manager claim that they did apply but ... not as much as we thought it will be (what kind of reply is that?)The beef was tasteless also.My colleague order ice chocolate and ended up taste like plain ice water. My ice latte was good! i'm happy with that thou!Karage was nice too! Overall, i guess i won't return to this restaurant again as the food standard cannot maintain when there's a huge crowd. Food price is not that cheap, and i don't want to risk for it
4
The food was good, especially the salted egg onion rings. The gyuniku donburi was pretty well done as well. The down-side was the seat reserved was rather warm as it's far from the air conditioners. The other disappointment would be the truffle fries, as the truffle smell was drowned out by the seaweed flavourings and had an overpowering taste as well. But all in all, it was an awesome place to chill at, from the food to the service and the atmosphere
4
The layout is spacious and the place is not too rowdy to enjoy a good chat over dinner. The food is tasty with a touch of creativity. The beef don is really good with a pinch of truffle that makes it not salty but yummy. The meat stewers are juicy and well marinated. Overall a great first experience
1
had 1 main, 2 sides. the slipper lobster was delicious, but the soggy bread with mayo soaked lettuce bits was very oily, so I didn't eat it at all. The side of salad was not seasoned, and for the price, don't think its worth it. The salted egg sauce onion rings were room temperature when it arrived, and after awhile, it was too oily also. their refinery wings were the worse. with the tough breaded texture, we had to peel off all the breaded skin and didn't finish at all. wont be coming back and wont be recommending anyone to go. this review is based on their sunday menu. which apparently is different from the tue-sat menu
5
Food is Awesome. Hot for an afternoon lunch. Air-condition could be better. Didn't get to try their milkshake as its an hour wait, kinda disappointed. Will be back for the milkshake
5
The services at refinery are very good. They are very attentive to customers need. They have brunch, lunch and dinner menu. As we went at lunch period, the lunch menu was given. They have good truffles fries and fried cauliflower fitters. Good for friends gathering.
3
Need to lower down the music volume. The summary of the visit : good food but music too loud that we have to go to other cafe for dessert and drinks.
4
Love the coffee waffle. Don are good too. Chicken soft bone a bit too salty.
Aircon not strong enough especially in Singapore humid weather
4
Food was great, everything was delicious. Highly recommend getting the salted egg onion rings and the assorted platter to share. Portions were small though. Tho items were priced reasonably, you'll prolly order a lot more and it adds up.
5
Among the burgeoning cafe scene which includes Chye Seng Huat Hardware and Tiramisu Hero, the Refinery is spacious and serves brunch, lunch, dinner, and open till late on weekends as a bar.It is not open on Monday and does not do dinner on Sunday.The coffee is good.We had Gyudon don with truffle mushrooms and foie gras, and mushroom risotto. Both were excellent in flavour. The only thing is small portion size which is good for heart health
4
1. Praline Ice MochaSmooth coffee that is not too strong for a not so coffee lover person.2. Macademia Coffee BallerU decide how strong u wan ur coffee to be by letting it melt while pouring the amount of milk.3. Salted Egg Onion RingsNice to be eaten alone. Find it too saltish if dipped into the Salted Egg sauce.4. Cauliflower FrittersSurprisingly nice with a tinge of lemon & wasabi sauce.5. Kopi Addict WafflesSoft coffee flavored waffles (I love soft waffles!!!) topped with sweet bacon & butterscotch ice cream.Overall, nice place to brunch. Food was too much for 2 (1 small & 1 moderate eater). Just had to order coffee. How can we come to a coffee place & not drink coffee! Lol
5
In short:Good place for lunch and to have discussions. Awesome food. Longer review:Located at Lavender (walking distance from the MRT station), you would not think that this place existed. But when you find it and step in, you find the atmosphere to be that of relaxing and quaint. The food menu has a delectable choice of items to choose from and I'd personally recommend the spicy mee.
4
Have been to The Refinery twice and the food standards are excellent. However, I find the beverages (i.e. coffee, latte etc.) a little pricey. Service crew was friendly when approached and atmosphere is fantastic. I keep coming back because I love the "airy space", thanks to the high ceilings (I hope that makes sense)
4
Came here for a birthday lunch with colleagues and made a booking through Chope. While the main courses took awhile to come, sides came very fast. We had the salted egg onion rings, truffle fries with wasabi, cauliflower fritters and chicken wings. The food is really good thought, and the serving is sufficient. Will come back here when my pockets are a little deeper though hah
5
nice place with good food. good service, wonderful place.
A bit difficult find thou. overall wonderful experience.
4
The salted egg onion rings and the beef bowl was really good! Perhaps the rice from the unagi bowl was a bit dry but overall very good! Prices are pretty reasonable as well!
4
Large spacious area with a good ambiance. Food was alright, recommend the teriyaki rice bowl and the cauliflower fritters!
5
Affordable fun Japanese fare. Be sure to try the Gyuniku Donburi (the fragrance of truffle hits you first, then the tasty tender meat) and Signature Molten Quail Eggs (literally amaze-balls).
5
great place to chill with a group of friends :) i had a large group of people (15) so it was hard finding a place that could accommodate all of us. this place was spacious and service is excellent.
4
I was there for dinner.
Nice place and great location, i like this kind of hidden places.
Interior design has old industrial look, with a nice bar.
Really enjoyed the skewers with japanese beer ... recommended.
Service was excellent, very nice crew.
4
Service was nothing to shout about, music was too loud. Do come here for the grub. Order the iced chocolate!
4
good and tasty food. no GST. Nice decor and good for business discussion. Highly recommended for those looking for a good place to eat.
4
The food was awesome and i recommend to totally go for those with the thumbs-up sign, which was what we did. No regrets! My favourite was the salted egg onion rings, it was soooo good! Battered cauliflower we claimed as veggies for the night :x Chicken high skewers was yum! And the rice bowls was heaven. Especially with the 72 deg onsen egg. Both the beef bowls and char siu bowls were yummy! Drinks were pretty good, loved the fact that they highlight was Hendricks gin! #mostawesomeginever
3
Personally, I'm not a fan of paying for smaller plates regardless of the taste and quality, so please keep that in mind when reading my review. I was glad to try out their set lunches as they're really near work for me. However at SGD16, the rice bowl I had was at best average. There was taste but no flavor - so something can taste salty or sweet, but there was no depth or richness to the whole dish. Sadly, the only highlight for me was the inch-sized cube of agadashi tofu - and it made for a very beautiful Instagram-worthy picture as well. Unless you're a hardcore whisky fan or you love these sort of hipster, outta-the-way nooks, I wouldn't make a trip here purposely for food. There are much better places out there that would be worth your calories and money
3
The waffles is very very nice! So far the best I have eaten. As for the food, I ordered the teriyaki don, the rice is cold not even warm, a bit disappointed. However the salted egg onion is nice.
5
Came here with a large group - great atmosphere and good location.
Good selection of drinks and food. The food was very good.
Would definately recommend a visit.
5
Had a great time and great food! Salted egg yolk onion rings were definitely worth the calories and the platter was more than enough for 2 to share as each skewer had a generous amount of ingredients on it
2
It was our first time here for dinner. Had the donburi with egg, skewer platter, cauliflower croquettes, century egg tofu. Everything was so so salty. Even the popcorn that was served as a starter was laced with salt and seasoning. Will not be returning.
4
The salted egg onion rings is a must. And the dry ramen tasted great but a bit too oily. Music was a bit too loud but overall a great place.
2
The place was very well-furnished with a modern vibe - it looked like a great place to hang out with a group of friends. While the menu looked extremely enticing, the quality and standard was sub-par at best. Presentation was wonderful, but the flavours were not - the milkshake was overflowing with whipped cream and candies, but the milkshake itself was thin and icy. The risotto was undercooked and underseasoned/flavoured, the gyuniku donburi was beautiful but over cooked. For a place that had the packinging and presentation done so very well, it was a disappointing experience, to say the least. 
4
we tried two of the donburi and it was good. Value for money too. Would recommend this place for a catch up with friends as it was not noisy although there were constant flow of customers. The seaweed fries with wasabi mayo was delicious. The wasabi provided a minimal kick without being overpowering.
4
Good place, good food! Price not too expensive, service was good! Waiters were all attentive! Only bad thing is, music was abitttt too loud. We cant really hear each other talk sometimes. But overall experience was great! Will go back again to explore more of the menu!
3
Really delicious gyuniku don topped with a slow-cooked egg! Definitely yum! The salted egg yolk onion rings weren't what I was expecting (was expecting a more Chinesey sauce but this was like a salted egg mayonnaise with added sugar). Seaweed truffles fries were disappointing because the seaweed didn't come through and neither the truffle (just tasted like a lot of potato). The truffled mushroom risotto (not pictured) was a little undercooked and for $18, where were the mushrooms?
3
Went there for brunch on Deepavali and ordered the pulled pork with sambal noodles and a cappucino. Noodles could've been more al dente and sambal was a little spicy for my wimpy tasty buds, but otherwise the pulled pork and sambal played off each other pretty well. I wish they would super-size their meatballs with more minced meat. Right now, they're a little petite and starchy for such a hearty dish. The cappucino was the real star of the meal - smooth and flavorful the way I like it. Will be back for the coffee and wouldn't mind trying the other items on the menu
3
Nice place, but food taste still needs to improve. Coffee taste was good. Location is convenient....
4
A great twist to fusion western and Japanese food on a stick! great ambience to chill on Friday night as well
5
Food was of decent portion and was served in about 10 minutes after my order placed at the cashier. Price was reasonable as well.
4
The place makes for a good hangout with the usual friends. Good food, drinks and nice ambience. Love the concept!
5
Must visit place! Nice atmosphere and great food. Location is convenient. Good for after work chill!
4
The food was fab and I really love the ambience. A great place to chill and munch on their food! :-)
4
Although the price is kind of expensive but I think is worth paying the money. The yakitori is very good - Is the best that I have tried so far.As for the ambience, is good they play nice music, volume just nice. Hence, you can listen to music and yet chatting/ catching up with friends.The service is good as well - the waiter and waitress are polite and helpful.The only thing I don't like is the few fake "bodies" hanging around the restaurant as decoration. I think that is weird. Overall, I think is a nice place to chill out with friends
4
Had brunch with my family. We walked by and saw the place, so we sat. Amazing ambience and good food.The need to pay at the cashier is a small minus. No space to even walk there... But the place and the design compensate any inconvenience.
4
Had a nice gathering with my pals!!! The Ultimate Platter is a must to have, especially for the wagyu beef that melts in the mouth!!! also we had 2 bottle of Snow Leopard Vodka with Cranberry Orange Mixer.... interesting combination and never regret it!!! Last but not least, there is free flow of spicy popcorn!!!! The staff were very helpful and nice too!!!
3
Don't expect amazing food, but Refinery does provide a nice place for a one of those long dinners + after dinner drinks. Love the 8m tall ceilings and spacious layout. Yakitori, dry ramen and tofu are all very mediocre. We like the Gyuniku Donburi, the cabbage salad and the refinery wings.
4
One of the few local quirky places in the city. Well stocked on Japanese sake, beers and whisky. The sound system in the space could do with a major improvement.
1
Table was small and cramps.. Waited 40 minutes for my food and was given the wrong order! Bad experience overall!
4
I visited here because a friend of mine recommended it. Upon entering the place, the high ceiling and minimalist interior caught my eye. Food choices arent that vast but sufficient. The only thing I didn't like about the food was the seaweed truffle fries. It was too salty so it wasn't pleasant.
4
Great place to have drinks, chill and chat. Request for sofa seats if you prefer it cosy. Service staff are friendly and prompt. Food is nice but not fantastic. Wagyu steak and dry ramen are worth trying. It's probably a great place for drinks given their list of japanese whiskey looks quite extensive. They also have japanese beer on tap. Worth a visit
5
Love the placeWe visit it at least once a week for our fix of good food, beer & lovely staff.Staff make the effort to talk to you & after a few visits they address you by name & remember your preferences.Spicy Ramen is a must & also the Chicken Karaage, Cauliflower Fritters.Love the skewers as wel
4
It is so contemporary and when I just went there I thought it serves western cuisines, not until I saw the sake in the store.The mixed style of Japanese food gives traces of modern taste to The Refinery. The high ceiling made the whole place very comfortable.Although it's yakitori supposedly the main role of the restaurant, it's salted egg onion rings are unforgettable. If the yakitori is a smaller bite sizes it would be almost perfect. The small untraditional ramen is also very delicious. The waiters are also very smart and fast. Great
4
An interesting restaurant situated near Jalan Besar Stadium, about 15 mins slow walk from lavender MRT station. Didn't drive there that day, felt like a "tourist" in my country walking around this interesting area for the first time. Many interesting eateries are sprouting around this area. My friends and I are too used to eating at common places, this time round they demanded something interesting! The food was priced reasonably. For big Sake drinkers, this is your place. I like the skewers and Onion rings with Salted Egg is a must. Will visit again...

Went to this The Refinery at Lavendar area for drink and food.The chef were the owner of Two Cooks and a Pan in botanic garden before he runs this bar now.Totally a humble guy and always make sure to make pr with his customers as well as feedback on his foods when he has the chance To do so. The place is cool, unique and i would give 9/10 for the ambience and layout. Service is great and definitely a good choice to visit this place again

A hidden gem in Jalan Besar! I hung out at The Refinery twice in a week! I have been raving to friends about this place but it truly warrants a review. As a New Yorker/Singaporean who appreciates good design, its lofty ceiling, old-school spiral staircase, open concept and industrial sensibility all contribute to its overall charm and appeal. It is a cozy place to catch up with friends, the drinks are wicked and we enjoyed the yakitori-style wings. I was relieved to find a spot like this in Singapore - unpretentious, with such a memorable atmosphere! We had such a fantastic time!! Now that I'm back in NY, I'm looking forward to my next visit in 2015

The ambience was pleasant and spacious, the servers were polite and good looking ;) food was presented clean and quick. Portions were small but fitting to price. Taste was exquisite and good choice of fusion. Must try the shishamo and tiger prawns. One should head to the second floor after the meal for the bar, talented bar tender and a cosy setting. Would definitely head there for future gatherings
