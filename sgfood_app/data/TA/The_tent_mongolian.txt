Nothing special, buffet food is not recomended. All the food cold and the taste also just flat. The staff are not friendly as well,

Mongolian BBQ is always a unique experience, they have a wide variety of meats, vegetables, sauces and spices to choose from. This is definitely a very good option for a party or just casual hangout. They have pretty good cocktails too!

I love the selection of meats. vegetables, sauces on offer at the tent. Truly something for people of all tastes, and the sauces can get very hot if you make your own! Service is very attentive and a great experience overall.

I was disappointed as I only saw this restaurant when I was on my last night of my holiday. The food was superb and you get to choose the amount of each ingredient and the spices and sauces are amazing. The staff were very good and helpful with the type of spices you may like if you are unsure, The food is then cooked in front of you which is viewable from the counter . The location is in Clarkes Key and I strongly recommend this restaurant to everyone who likes a spicy meal in a great location

The experience in this restaurant is very different! Unlike the so called Mangolian BBQ in US malls, this one offers a very wide range of ingredients and sauces. The buffet provides us with a Soup (usually I skip) and a assortment of ingredients (both healthy and unhealthy but tasty) with Sauces. To make it easy, there is a spice level guide. Love this restaurant

Difficult to know how you could go too far wrong at this place. Choose whatever seafood, meat and veggies you fancy then mix your own sauce or take one of their suggestions and then they'll cook it for you. The staff are ever willing to point you in the right direction if you're not sure how it all works and you can go back for as many helpings as you like so it will pay to take it easy on the first one. Sit inside or perhaps, better still, outside next to the fountain in Clarke Quay and watch the people go by. Beers and a half decent wine list which isn't too pricey (not by Singapore standards at least). I've yet to take a visitor to Singapore for a meal here and not have them ask to go back. Any number of pubs and bars nearby for a before or after drink. Altogether good spot

My husband and I enjoyed the Mongolian Grill, we like the concept of choosing own food and having it made especially for you. Good selection of veggies and meat, the food being halal was great we really enjoyed the chicken and lamb. The staff were very helpful and attentive. The fpod is unlimited but we were full after the first visit!! Think the grill price is pricey at 36sgd plus tax when you end up only going once. A similar restaurant we went to in whistler had the same concept but the ingredients were weighted then charged a price rather then being a fixed price. Anyways the high price is likely due to the fact the restaurant is located in Clarke Quay. Overall enjoyed the food..

I've been to a couple of Mongolian BBQ restaurants before and this one was just as good. A great way to eat lots of fresh vegetables and meat! The lady at the sauce counter was really helpful when it came to choosing a suitable sauce combination

It reminds me of eating at a Teppanyaki restaurant where you choose your own ingredients and the chef makes it for you. Not as special or charming as people have made out. The foods ok and the restaurant is ok. The whole Mongolian tent thing didn’t impress me one bit. I thought it would be a traditional Mongolian tent with local ingredients etc… from what I have read about Mongolia it doest resemble anything of a Mongolian tent. A Mongolian tent would have so much more character. It was my error for thing a Mongolian tent would be in a shopping mall

The all you can eat buffet is simply fantastic. Start with choice of noodles/rice then vegetables, meat and finally sauces. The sauces is where this place is set apart from others with at least 50 to choose from. You can either create your own or the very well informed host will ask you for a preference and she will tailor make a sauce for your needs!Needless to say that i had several visits to the buffet where all the food is very fresh and cooked to perfection, highly recommended
