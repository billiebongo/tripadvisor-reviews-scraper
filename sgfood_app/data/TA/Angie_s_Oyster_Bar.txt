Awesome place! Killer views! If you love seafood - this is the place for you. Oysters from $1 each, who can resist this kind of price. Well, i could not. Ate a lot of oysters, drank a lot of wine, chatted with friends- overall great Wednesday night out. Place is on level 45 of the office building, a hidden gem. (TIP) There are a few other bars, restaurant on the same level. So you can do a bit of "pub crawl" without leaving the buildin

drinks was great actually, happy hour wine/cocktails at ten dollars however food on the other hand was not that good. food was too pricey for its quality - we wanted to share a spanish octopus and mac & cheese - the octopus was too small for eighteen dollars as it wasn't fantastic to say. the mac & cheese wasn't too bad but overall for the price we were paying, i would expect more. same goes for the mains but the starters were more disappointing. overall the ambience and drinks was good, but i wouldn't recommend dining here

I was surprised to find out such a wonderful chill out place in the middle of this tall office building. It has a beautiful view of the Marina bay and also good beers - ordered 2 sets of beer paddles which come with 5 sample glass of different beer at a reasonable price of $20 per set.I believe they serve good oysters and I’ll be back soon to give it a try

Excellent fresh seafood served and excellent service given to you when 6 of us visited to celebrated a friend’s birthday. Oysters and the seafood platter were so fresh and sweet!!! We also had cream mussels and clams which was so good and the Mac and cheese is also to die for!!! Love it!!! Love the place, love the ambience, love the service, love the food. We are definitely coming back for more soon!!! Thank you for everything.

Meals - Absolutely the worst. Oysters were all having a same type of taste even though the restaurant claims its different. The Tacos was terrible. The bread hard and the tuna peppered with paprika, but not well made at all. Service is pathetic. The Caucasian guy who is the senior manager is not at all sincere and not trust worthy. He promised a table when there was a vacant one, but fell back on his promise when the turn came up. When I spoke to the restaurant waiter about this unprofessional behavior, the Caucasian guy presented himself to me asking what's the issue. Aha.. His integrity and dishonesty was the problem. Beware of hi

Read the reviews on Tripadvisor on Angie's Oysters in Singapore so we thought we would give it a go whilst we are in Singapore.We got to the Land Tower which is in the financial centre on Raffles Place and took the lift to level 45 where Angie's is located.You walk into a bar area with an open kitchen to the left. We announced that we did'nt make a reservation and asked if there was a table for 2. They checked and took us to a table. This is a roof top eating place with a superb view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel in the distance and Singapore river. There are a few tables and comfortable lounges spread over a small area. It can be quite breezy there. As it was about 7pm when we arrived, the place was almost full with young working people probably having a few drinks and dinner with their colleagues or friends. There is an Happy Hour menu for oysters between 6pm and 8pm for S$1 each. We opted for the S$2.50 each and ordered a dozen. They came in a tray with ice with a lemon slices and tobasco sauce. The oysters were small but tasted nice. They went down quickly. Next, we had the Argentinian grilled prawns, 4 pcs with some lettuce leaves in balsamic vinegar They were very tasty too; we could have easily eaten more. Lastly, the whole grilled lobster arrived on our table with a separate bowl of french fries. We quickly devoured the lobster. As you know, lobster does not have huge amount of meat on them, nevertheless, it was lovely. A whole lobster set you off at S$58. The place is busy, a hang out with friends or work colleagues or just simply for oyster lovers like us. We had oysters in France and in the UK and it was good to sample some oysters in Singapore and visited Angie's. The Wise-Ones8th November 201

I went here at lunch time, and although the happy hour oyster offers are only valid 6-8pm I was still very happy with the price/quality ratio. I had a choice between two types of oysters, half a dozen either forSHD26 or 36. I picked the pricier option with a side of truffle fries. Oysters were fresh, juicy, nicely served, staff was friendly and professional. I will definitely return on my next visit to Singapore / hoping they will still have the happy hour oysters! ;) views are great, this is a little gem for oyster lovers

located on the 45th floor of the Singapore Land Tower, this place gives a great view of the surrounding. came for lunch today. when we arrived, there weren't any one yet.. we took some pictures and sat ourselves down on high tables. the set lunch menu is decent - the fish and chips are really good value for money. the fish is fresh and the batter simply light and delicious. we had the chocolate mud cake for dessert, with ice cream and praline. good service, lovely staff, good breeze, the casual laid back ambience, the bottles of ice water and the great music. it was definitely a lovely way to spend our lunch hour. may return in the evening to catch the happy hour specials. and probably the oysters and seafood. oh, if you want some thing more upmarket in ambience, check out sear which is on the opposite end

My girlfriends and I decided to give this place a try as we love seafood and was told this was the place to go.The evening started great, but as the evening went on, it started going downhill. We ordered a second portion of bread to go with the mussels; which were delicious, it was more than half an hour before the bread came, and by then the sauce (from the mussels) were cold, in that space of time we had to ask 4 times before the bread came. And reason given for the long wait, the kitchen was very busy!!We ordered a portion of mac and cheese, it was not the best we've had and for that price, I expected better.And since the oysters was the reason we went, we decided to have another round and ordered about 20 minutes before happy hour was over. After nearly an hour of waiting, asking numerous times about our order, and was also told our order wasn't placed, that there were no more oysters!! We then decided it was time to go

They offered different types of oyster, ranging $1 to $3 per oyster. You should consider having mussels and clams because it's includes free flow of fries

This is another place to dine/ chill with a view. On one side you see the Marina/ MBS and other other the CBD. Couple of times we were there they had this $1 oyester promotion and that made it awesome. Must check out place.Drinks tend to be on the exp side - look out for drinks promos

Reservation is a must, Best to go just before sunset around 7'sh. great environment however the loud music from the next door really annoying. Friendly staff, good value drinks during happy hours. All good, however I think they need to improve the condition of the table & chairs

I really enjoyed coming here for happy hour (6pm to 8pm daily). The oysters were $1++ each, the views was lovely and the staff were friendly. The prices of food and drinks were quite expensive, but that can be expected due to the location. The views of the city is spectacular and they played good music

Make sure to be there early for the $1 oyster, it's a hot pick! They were also having the 1 for 1 lobster roll promotion when I went! It's really great for value! But I personally think that the lobster is so so cause it's too small. Overall it was a great evening at Angie's Oyster Bar

Go early at around 6 to catch the twilight hours around the Central Business District and Marina Bay Sands. Service is prompt and informed without being pushy. Current promo of $1 oysters are very decent and worth it, but we also ordered the $3.50 one afterwards and they were simply fantastic! Fresh, chilled and nicely shucked with Craft Beer and $10 Prosecco, Angie's is a nice place to chill out ..... note that there this roof top venue is not air conditioned so dress accordingly

Read so many reviews so my colleagues and I decided to give this place a try for lunch. Surprisingly their lunch set is only $12++ but small selection and rather small portion. Had the fish and chips - was good. The view is spectacular and on that day we went was a super windy day with dark clouds. So we really enjoyed the great breeze. Service was good because they will take the orders, served the food and very much left us though they do pop over once a while to check if everything is ok. Very attentive servers. Saw a lot of evening oyster, lobster roll and beer promotion. Definitely bringing my hubby to chill on one of the evenings

I was searching for a good oyster bar in SG and I stumbled finding this place, what a gem! 5stars on the ff: quality of the oysters (all from France from $1-3.5/piece on Saturday evening), craft beers, selection of wines, amazing view as the place is on the 45th floor, al fresco, service is prompt, attentive and friendly staff & value for money. The ambience is relaxed, casual or smart casual it's all up to you. One of the top best on my list in Singapore, a place where I can see myself again and again!

THIS IS THE PLACE TO GO FOR OYSTERS.Seriously. Gets you in 'the mood'... if you know what I mean.I had a lot the other day. Probably a dozen or more. Felt damn good after that. That's why I couldn't right a review then... cos it would have been under the influence of oysteres.Great service. They don't bother you much, once everything you've ordered has come to the table. So if you're looking at extras, good luck.Ambience is nice. Makes you want to eat, more. Location is great. But I drive a fancy car, so you on the public transport, find your way there. I got GPS

Booked a table through email reservations and they were very prompt in replying back to me and very nicely booked a table with a nice view for me since I mentioned that it was a celebration of a good friend's birthday.We went for the Happy Hour Oysters and very gladly they have the $2 oysters which is of better quality from Aussie/NZ (can't rmb which country) and went ahead with it instead of the $1 choice. No doubt it was a good decision made cause the $2/oyster quality was so much better and fleshy that we got ourselves another half a dozen. The combination of their fresh onion and lemon was perfect. I gave the $2 oysters a 10/10 Rating.We've also tried the tap beers however we didn't really like it and it was not in favor to our beer taste buds! The Chocolate flavor want was really a no go for me and my mate and I would never try it again but of course this is individual preference. aside from that, we've ordered the Small plate Mac & Cheese and the portion is of a good size and not too small! Mac & cheese of restaurant standard and worth it :)Lastly we've ordered the Mussels (Main-500g) for $38++ that comes with free flow fries. we remembered clearly that we ordered the Cream based one but when it came it was abit Tomato-ed & the texture was watery instead of thick cream(which we were expecting). however so the taste was not too bad however the size of the mussel flesh is not of standard as compared to the oysters. we had!Menu of the Tap beer is not updated thou so the bartender have to verbally explain to you.There is a Pilipino Manager (Navy Blue Shirt) that well served us with genuine smile and service and he did give us a memorable dining experience.Recommendation: don't book it at 530pm cause the sun is directly facing the restaurant during sunset and it's super warm. 6pm should be a good timing and try to request a table by the edge to get the best view
