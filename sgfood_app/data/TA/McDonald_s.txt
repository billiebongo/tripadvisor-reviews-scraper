Located at T2 level 3 on the departure terminal. It has big sitting area and serve you fresh hot meals. In around 5.99 you can make your own meal .

If you are departing from Terminal 2 and want to have a burger, this is the place to eat. This place will always have many visitors, therefore, be there well ahead of your departure time.

It's quick and you know what your getting, always busy but their location ambiance could be better. Lighting? Good when you are tired and you can get your usual ha ha without much thinking.

Disorganised waste of time. Stood in line to get something quick for my wife. After 20 minutes, I decided she was not that hungry.
3
Had quick bite with departing guests. Plenty of space that fit all kids and adults. Only thing I don't like is the place can be quite noisy for chit chatting.

Enjoyed chicken burger upon our arrival from Kuala Lumpur, nice taste & filling too. And it's HALAL as confirmed by one of the staff.

Upon arriving you have automated machines to take ur orders "not personal not friendly I want a live person. Waiting in line a long time just because you'd like to force your customers to use these devices I will not. Your fries were cold.

Didn't actually get to eat here as stood in a non moving queue for 15 minutes and did not move.. Gave up.
Get the automatic pay screens like in France McDs because the mayhem in front of the counter and behind was ridiculous.

I've been too lazy to write reviews these days but I must right a wrong. McDonald's is known for consistency. And this outlet is bringing shame to the reputation of the brand. What's worst is they are located in a prestigious place like an international airport where I assume other brands could be featured for good service or food. This outlet has consistently been serving soggy fries, less than full bag of fries as well and they have cut short of their professionalism just because of hoping to save time. All the food was pre-cooked in huge quantity beyond a good estimate of crowd control. Unfortunate and disappointed. Took some photos to show the medium fries quantity where all of them collapsed (showing overduely heated fries) and not adequately filled bag of fries (regular macdonalds diners should know what I mean). Avoid if you can. Save your mac craving to the city or the neighborhood outlets.

This McDonald's is halal, which wouldn't bother me of the food tasted alright. Had a breakfast platter which tasted as though it had been seasoned with baking soda instead of salt, especially the hash browns. I get their customers are probably largely Muslim but lack of real bacon and sausages is so disappointing to a weary traveler

I choose 3 hamburger but that's not delicious and anw it's expensive :( The space is large but a little dirty. Too crow for people to get inside. Waiting late to receive food. Dont come here again T_T

Can't go wrong with maccas for breakfast! The service was quick and the staff were friendly.
I had pancakes/hotcakes and definitely had a different taste compared to the ones at home in Australia, still good though.

This is a good Mc Donalds. The burgers are good .They are tasty.Service is good. The ambiance is O K.

This place is very to find. Moreover, the menu is common and if you want veg-food, you might have to take an odd burgers like McChicken without chicken. Other than that, place could be crowded during evening time
4
Good service, typical McDonald's menu. Convenient location. Accepted my UK cards. When you want a meal, without spending a lot, McDonald's is always a safe bet.

Similar to any Mcdonalds joint.
Service was good.
Mc Spicy chicken was good. Also new caramel desert is nice.

Bought chicken burger and cocacola for 4 sg$. It's good to have sufficient food during busy hours while transit in Changi airport. Pay is very less compare to other restaurants around there. Like McDonalds in China too. A-La-Carte is good. But they can give for combo pack too in displays

The level 1 was closed for temporary on the day we were there. After immigration in Terminal 2 there was another one which bigger seating space. We ordered sausage muffin with eggs set and it was good as usual. The toys wasn't cute for happy meal this time ="
3
Many flights arrive at Changi airport early am as ours did just before 5 am. The question is where to get an early coffee/breakfast before our next flight 5 hours later.The answer is McDonalds in Terminal 1 where there will be a small lineup but you are sure the food is hot and the line moves relatively quickly. Credit cards are accepted and a sign posts exchange rates for key currencies so I assume they accept these.It is a simple, common McDonalds menu that works in this environment. Seating is in a common area in front of the restaurant

Escalator closed, we have to take Elvelator down to Level 1 today. I haven't visit McDonald for a very long time. Now it's only 1 cashier couture and a few of automatic ordering machine which accept Visa, master and Amex credit cards. Fast and convenient. Muffins sausage with egg still good as usual. Cappuccino was a bit burnt.
4
Love the breakfast menu, of course the package is always good. Order a sweet cake, tortilla (or whatever you can call it), hash brown and egg. The place is clean and the meal is good.
3
Great as a place for breakfast before the early flight out. However queues were rather long, could do with more staff.
4
After a 12hr flight this is the perfect pick-me-up. A breakfast McMuffin washed down with a coffee.
I have used McD for a long time but was very happy with the product served. It was cheap to buy but tasted very good indeed
4
I tried the prosperity burger and twister fries. It was a good burger with pepper sauce and the fries were nicely crunchy. Plenty of seating, otherwise the usual McD's experience.
4
The one consistent is the big yellow M and its ability to keep the younger kids happy before getting on long haul international flights is great. Food quality here is good as well.
4
mcdonalds - keeping their standards, usually order my burger special made so it will be made-to-order and hot, but the fries are not that good compared to other places
4
i kinda surprised when found this place, because all the menu here r very different with my hometown mcd. i made order of chicken, bigmac and some potatoe mash. very very delicious, maybe its just me very excited with new taste of mcd. very tasty and love it! found many young around me doing their study. looks like they also love this place

Been surprised by the way how to collect your order. Usually in Singapore you order/pay in one lane and go to the next Jane to pick it up. Here the pick-up is one counter only, where you have to watch your order number show up and then step up to receive your meal. Wonder if this is a pilot project. Meals as usual, quiet area, ok if you are in the bed for a snack or coffee while waiting for your guests to arrive.

McD is at its standards but it is not a place for vegetarians. You will be told they will remove beef and give you the burger for veggies. The only thing you can eat there for veggies is French fries. My other friend who is non veg did enjoy the food out there. Good quality and taste is also good what he told.

Kids meal for only sgd4.80 inclusive of fresh Apple slices, not too sweet Milo and a half dozen chicken nuggets. Seating can be found even during busy hours. There's a lot of variety on the menu and free Internet in a safe and comfy environment- what more would you want from a McD?
