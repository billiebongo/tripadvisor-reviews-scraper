Stopped here with a friend for lunch today. The Cafe was fairly empty so no problems getting a table. We both ordered burgers which were tasty enough but not exceptional. Service was friendly and efficient.

Tried their chicken chop, chicken cutlet, baked rice and burger, all of which are average. Place is quiet and unpretentious, and rather conveniently located in Bugis. An ok place for a slightly cheaper meal in the city.

During my visit, there wasn't alot of guest however only a family and I was there. Service and food wise was excellent.

We went here for an early dinner as we had somewhere else to go. We both had steak which took a very long time to arrive, we had to ask the waitress how much longer it would be. The food was quite good and the waitress was a nice girl, the ambience was interesting as we sat outside and watched the vehicles being moved and the table and chairs being set up for the 6 o'clock street closing

We had the beef burger and the fish fillet burger (via Foodpanda). They are smaller than the Whopper burgers from Burger King. But that said, the burgers we had were made with a lot of care; and the fries were nice and fat and fresh. It was just right for brunch. All told this would be our go to place for burgers when we are in the neighbourhood. Thank you

I came on a Tuesday evening, the restaurant was quite. But we know what we want so we get our orders immediately. We ordered the spicy lamb burgers,Popcorn chicken. The staff was very attentive & friendly. We really enjoyed their homemade burger patties & popcorn chicken. It was really fresh & good !! I even takeaway an extra lamb burger for my family.I would recommend place to my friends if they would like to have a good burger & have a nice gathering with friends

So this is two reviews. On the first night we ordered at 11:30pm from FoodPanda (Cheese Pizza and Chicken Satay) - it arrived hot and timely to our hotel which was really within walking distance but we wanted to eat in our suite (as my kid was sleepy, and picky with her food). Food was great, the satay was spiced and came with nice peanut paste. The pizza was hot, and the 4 cheese layer was yummy.On the second night we thought we would visit the actual restaurant, and found it easy. We were the only guests though, it seems void of any atmosphere inside, but sitting outside you felt part of the buzzing street, unfortunately on the night we visited, the other restaurants seemed much busier but serving more Lebanese type food and my kid prefers a western diet :) The staff were very attentive and nice and explained its hard for businesses in this street - as there is a lot of choice for customers, they seem to have a great relationship with the people next door and had some of their customers seated in our area - and those guys were splitting their drinks with Perfetto Cafe and their food with next door - seems to work for them.I think Perfetto Cafe is great for the food - we certainly enjoyed two nights of food from here and would not hesitate to either eat in or order again from them.We also had some Coke Floats and homemade ice tea - both were very cold and refreshing

Had a dinner with my girlfriend yesterday at this place. There was nobody but another couple with us at the Cafe.. Ordered the Double Lamb Spicy Burger,Mushroom Soup and Shrimp Pasta. Only the Mushroom Soup is OK but the portion was pathetic. It was served in a small bowl that looks like a teacup. I wouldn't say the food was bad but it is totally not worth the money. Thank god it was on promotion... (1 for 1) On the other hand, the lady serving us that night was great, she is friendly and she poured us water at the start(plus point), the only downside is that she could at least take a look at our cups and take the initiative to refill them as there is only 2 tables at the moment. If you're looking for a nice place to eat I wouldn't recommend this place to you guys. Knowing that there is a "photo to share" option I regretted not taking a photo of the Mushroom Soup

I've been in this place for a dinner with my girlfriend and we were extremely happy with the food(I took the double lamb cheese burger,highly recommend) and the staff was extremely friendly,mostly the hostess who gave us plenty info about Singapore history and what are the highlights!

One of the worst restaurant that I have visited. The presentation is unappealing and food seems to be prepared using the microwave which came out really dry. Service is reasonable as we will the only table on a Saturday evening. I will consider hiring a new cook if they are keen to survive.

The cafe was quiet, the food was reasonably cheap and very filling and they were playing the Backstreet Boys. It was exactly what I needed.

Was lucky enough to come across this place one evening about 8pm and had a few beers with friends. Was sad that we had already eaten as the menu looked very interesting and the beer was nice and cold a reasonable price and service excellent

Interesting carte with baguette and pain perdu. Little kfe and great service! For not so much we eat a gratin of chicken with glasses of wine. Quiet place but still on the flow of the street ;)

Myself and two colleagues were looking for a place to eat near Beech Road and came across this little gem. Let's be honest, this is not fine dining but what it is is good honest food. A reasonable menu and a fair price. The food was excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed it. The staff are pleasant. It's really worth a visit, I would go again if in that area of the city

I live on Beach Road and often stroll the streets of Kampong Glam and Arab Street looking for those interesting eateries.Perfetto Cafe is a pleasant surprise as a cafe offering a unique menu for breakfast, lunch or dinner. A visit on the weekend is special as the street is blocked to automobiles and you can sit outside under a sun umbrella and enjoy a delicious meal and very good Italian coffee.For those visitors looking for variety in bottled, quality beer. Perfetto Cafe has a good selection with very moderate prices. The waitstaff are helpful and always happy to serve you as their guest and a complimentary membership is available for frequent visitors

We were in for a group of 4pax on a Wednesday night. We ordered the rack of lamb, pasta, baked salmon, popcorn chicken.Rack of lamb was really good ! Popcorn chicken was delicious too.Overall, we did enjoy ourselves on that night.Service was good also. Keep up the good work

Gave the extra point for them trying. Place is dark and draby, food cheap but nothing special. Hubby had to leave the spicy lamb burger half eaten as it was way too spicy(strange as we eat very spicy food). Waffle was heavy and not fully cooked and had too much whipped cream on it. Chicken popcorn probably cooked twice as were the chips as both were dry and veered on overcooked side. The two wait staff were obviously struggling to manage even a small crowd. Convenient location and one of the cheaper eats along the street.

Had a great dinner with my partner. Being first time there, had asked the staff for their signature dishes. The staff were very friendly and patience to give us their recommendations. After knowing that their burgers were homemade, we had order a salmon burger and it was awesome. The Uptown Steak was excellence too

Took a work party of sixteen here as it is halal friendly and our group included observant Muslims. Booked in advance. Were the only people in the restaurant. The food arrived staggered over an hour and a half with appetisers arriving after main courses were finished. In the end we had to cancel some meals and go and eat elsewhere. We had to argue to stop them overcharging us. I left a plate of rancid lamb. Salmon dishes were overcooked. Rice dish was uninspired. Satay meat was gristly and unappetising. There was no sense that they had let us down. No apology. I suppose the clue is in the name - this is a cafe. Ordering food from the menu and expecting to eat together as a group is not recommended. A truly appalling experience

Ice cream is super good!!! They make ice cream by themselves, and use the true food, for example, I ate the mango ice cream, it just let feel like I ate a really mango, very delicious!!! I will enter the restaurant for their different tastes of ice cream
