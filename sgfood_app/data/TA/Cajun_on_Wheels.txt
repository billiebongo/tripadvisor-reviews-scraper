Hi, I had went to your outlet in Plaza Sing on 30.01.2018 for an early dinner with my wife. The place was empty being us the only customers. Upon reaching there, there were no staffs on the floor (might be due to non peak period as it was about 5pm :/) I approached the counter and there was a muslim lady and upon calling her, she came over. We looked at the menu(bear in mind it was our first time there after many cancelled dates) we told the staff we will sit and go tru the menu. We sat at a corner which was an ideal spot to chill. After making up our mind on the items, I approached the counter and had to call the staff again as it seems all were busy with their phones. I ordered the Insane Shrimps Cajun, Spicy Chilli Crab Mixed Seafood Set wf rice + 1 drink and salted egg fried squid. No crabs for now as I’m not supposed to. The staff then asked what’s my order for one more drink. I then informed I would get a mineral water then. All was ok, till she passed me the drinks. An empty cup and 1 bottle of mineral water. I then requested for another cup as I needed ice for the mineral water. The staff stood there with a blank face and just look at me smiling and just said “hmm”. After she gathered the items, I asked once again whether I was gonna get the cup and informed that I did not mind paying to get it. Then the staff gave me a cup and said “never mind, I will give to u”. Is there a rule that those getting the mineral waters can’t have a cup just because you have the self help dispensers? Is this the company practise? I would also like to ask, is there no staff serving you at the table? Maybe that’s the reason for no gst and no service charge as there is totally no customer service. In between the meals, no one came up to us or anything at all. The chilli crab sauce was plain burning and cant even feel the taste. The Cajun sauce was great though. The Being the only customer at that moment, we would expect at least a little service. Even fast food joins would send you your orders if you had to wait. After eating, we wrapped the plastic and threw it away. This was the first time and probably the last. Great food with bad service equals to zero in my opinion

it was quite a bad experience for a first time diner at Plaza Sing outlet. I made a reservation slightly earlier on that day itself and as a first time diner at Cajun Wheel. We were quite excited and looking forward for a pleasent dinning experience. I came on time for my reservation at 215pm and the outlet was quite empty at that time, there isn’t any staffs to welcome us on the ground. I stood there for a good 10mins and I saw a sign that said ‘ please approach the counter if you have a reservation’. So yeah after reading that I approached the counter and I saw there were 3 guys sitting at a corner. I told them I made a reservation and their replied was ‘okay you can just sit’ Me being a nice customer I answered ‘you mean I can just sit anywhere?’ They said yes and in additional I told them I need 3 baby chairs. They said I could grab themselves. Okay fine I assume there isn’t any gst charges for the place therefore there was no customer service. I went to find a long table which is able to fit 6 adults and 3 baby chairs. I seated comfortably while waiting for my friends to arrive. Afterwhich we went to order for our foods. Upon ordering,here came an antonishment from the cashier. He asked how many paxs are we ordering for? We replied 6. He confidently saying that table is for 11 paxs and questioning asked why are we sitting at there?I patiently replied that it was his co-workers who told me I could sit anywhere. Guess what, instead of taking our orders or even apologised for the tone he questioning us. He went to the kitchen and questioned with his co -workers. Things to bring up;1.Shouldn’t he be taking our orders first before settle the ops issue with his co - workers2. He expected us to move out from that long table even thought we have settled the 3 kids with their baby chair. ( on a side note he did allowed us to remained the same seats as we raised our voices for such a ridiculous request) 3. The tone that he used to questioned us.

Head to the order counter to order, there’s a tap to wash your hands, food was not bad, the chilli crab sauce was quite burning but quite nice. It’s actually quite expensive though which maybe going to a seafood restaurant or hot pot maybe more worth

Rude lazy waitress .She showed no interest nor having the initiative to get things done even after she clearly saw us waiting and expecting for the table to be cleaned. I kindly went to her asking her to clean our table but she told me to move to another table instead which was also uncleaned,unprepared,the table was wet and there are even a few used cups on the table. She did not clean our table even after we waited for 20 minutes but she kept herself busy by doing things which are clearly unnecessary. We ended up clearing and cleaning the table on our own. She even rudely stared at us. We are truly disappointed,feeling disgusted with that such unprofessional,ugly and uncultured attitud

AC is leaking where we seated at but all in all ambiance is ok.. it’s quite expensive I’ll come more often if it’s not. It’s nice to find crawfish in Asia. Taste ok not really fantastic they gave us rice that’s cold and we need to approached them to replace it for us.

With crawfish available in Asia it should be more reasonable. I’m from Louisiana and I’m Cajun so we know how it’s done/cooked. Eating crawfish in Asia has been a disaster but you have redeemed Asia for coming and doing a ok job with your crawfish. Would I eat here again yes but not often, make it more affordable and I’d be here every time I’m in Singapore.

It is Worth it and the Food is quite good and tasty. But the service is not up to standard for a restaurant.

The food was tasty...and best so far. Price a bit steep for 2-3 pax. Excelkent service from all staff.

Reserved on Chope but no table assigned when we arrived. Had to remind staff multiple times to clear table.

Good location with different shop surrounding it. Expensive but worth the try. Food was scrumptious. Portion was a bit small but nevertheless was worth a try.

First time visiting this and was not impress at all. Food portion was really small and for that kinda price, there are similar restaurants with the same concept providing more bang for the buck. Taste was so so. But for that price I would say it’s not worth it. Wouldn’t recommend this to anyone as there are better ones with more value out there

Made a reservation on weekend for C.O.W. but surprinsgly it wasn't very crowded at all. The good thing is that it is quiet and suitable for group gathering. However for a meal, easily it will cost you a minimum $60-80 for a meal. I would say it is slightly on the higher side. However food taste is good and everything else is good. Probably will only visit once only due to the price range. Cannot afford to keep coming back even though it's quite delicious! Recommend to come at least once.

This is a small fast food joint in the Signapur mall just 2 minutes walk from the Innotel hotel. They sell a variety of sea food such as shrimp and crab with sides. The price is reasonable we had two lunch deals the Fish Topedo which consists of fish bites with shrimp and rice as a side, it only cost $23 signapore dollars for the two meals. The staff were friendly and the recommended a nice spicy sauce to go with the meal. The meal tasted good and it was fulling. While sitting in the restaurant eating we were able to get free WiFi

My colleagues and I went for group lunch on a Wednesday at Plaza Singapura. We ordered the Sailor's Feast and the Nice Platter. You can choose to have either pilaf rice or pasta to go along with the meal.The meals were a little pricey. But there's No GST / Service tax. The Cajun fries were really tasty, couldn't get enough of it. The fried mushrooms and sweet potatoes were tasty too! The pilaf rice was flavourful, with curry taste.The possible downside was that the prawn was not as big as I expected.... Though the one-person portion meals like burgers and ocean platter seemed value for money. Also, we wanted the clam chowder and aglio olio pasta but both were not available. Understandably the staff explained the supplier has yet to deliver the pasta, & the clam chowder was unavailable to order for weeks(?!). That was a tad disappointing, they could have at least covered those options on the menu (maybe use a sticker/masking tape, or put a label on the menu).Overall we still enjoyed the meal and it was a pleasant experience.

Everything was perfect except that we have to wait for a long time to be seated. There was no sign "please wait to be seated"....ironically we did wait to be seated. No staff came to show us the seats. It was self service. Once we noticed customers were about to leave, we had to be on alert to grab the seats. Since there were 5 of us, we aimed for table of 6. The group before us left a big mess on the table and we called the staff to clean. He was very helpful & patience. He was very thorough in job, making sure the table was really clean. We bought quite a small portions (according to the staff) for 5 of us but it turned out they were just nice. Food was yummy and seafood were fresh! We love the pilaf rice and sweet potatoes were amazing!

Treated my cousin to a birthday dinner here & ordered Combo 1 with the choice of lobster in Cajun herb & butter sauce. The lobster was a bit overcooked & the sauce was just okay to me. Had the Thai Red Curry sauce on the side which I thought was tastier! The prawns was of a good size though & they were very fresh! There was so much that for once, we actually could not finish our prawns! I don't usually eat mussels but I thought their mussels were delicious! Also had the salted egg yolk fries which was so yummy! The lobster bisque was sadly way too salty... Nonetheless, we had a great experience & I'm so glad that C.O.W has it's own space now
