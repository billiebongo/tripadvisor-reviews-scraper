They server a very nice churros which is still affordable. It also provides the chocolate dip for you to enjoy. The churros are topped with confectioner sugar.

Nice Churros here. Had some with the family after the meal and they were good. I would go again. Price was OK.

Been coming back to this place for many years now, always a stopover when i come to Clarke Quay and definitely one of the places in Singapore to enjoy your churros-craze! Served with Milk and Chocolate! YUMMMY!

Thought this place will have good churros, since the bar is named after it, but kinda disappointing. Can't really taste the cinnamon powder. We also ordered the chicken wings. Not recommended for that kinda price. Thought there's more food options, but I don't see it.

The churros were ok the quantity of dipping sauce was sparse however the service was faultless. Our waitress was the highlight of the night. I would go again just for the service

It's a nice place to chill outdoors. Their warm bite-size churros covered with cinnamon sugar and accompanied with chocolate sauce and condensed milk are really delicious. They also serve quite a wide varieties of cocktails, beers and shots. Do check out for their happy hour promo too

Stopped by Alegro late Friday night for some beer and wings. Limited drinks menu. They have a good promo on buckets of beer which was nice. The food was meh, nothing to write home about, but filled our bellies.Overall good experience, affordable. OK value for money. Would recommend. Would come back

After wandering around Clark Quay we found this great spot with easy music and a pretty cool and funky cocktail list. Would recommend their signature drink, the G-Point as well as their version of Mojito. Double cocktails at happy hour prices! We were reliably informed that their double cocktails (at normal price) are almost the same as single serves in other bars. Having walked around Clark Quay we can attest to that. Their prices are indeed very reasonable for the area. I think their happy hour double cocktails were $14 or thereabouts (sounds high but isn't compared to the other bars. Walk around and you will see!). We didn't try the churros (will go again for that) but their chicken wings are divine! It's not a big place but there are enough alfresco tables outside where you can sit and watch the world go by. The best thing though is the service. The staff actually talk to you and have a proper conversation. They are polite and respectful and don't at all act like they are going through the motions. We felt genuine interest as they asked us a lot of questions about our experiences abroad and about our home country. We taught them a few phrases in our language and will test them when we go again.Kudos to the manager and the staff for the way they operate. Genuine warmth and attention to detail. Will definitely return

We stopped by and ordered a corona and a sparkling mineralwater. They didn't have mineral water but offered soda. So OK. The place was practically empty, indeed may have been empty, and that should have been a hint. The bill came to $24. When questioned we were told that was standard - $14 for the Corona and $8 for a soda in a medium sized glass, 2/3rds full of ice and a splash of soda.I wouldn't recommend this nor would I go back

my friend and I had one of the best nights in singapore in a long while. We were searching for cheap beers and after every place in Clark quay this was the cheapest, and the service was amazing and very friendly and helpful. Roofy our waitress was excellent and served us all night and Jamie the manager or owner was very friendly as well. We went for just a quick beer but stayed until 3am will be back for sure and I recommend u give this place a go , cheapest beer and best service
