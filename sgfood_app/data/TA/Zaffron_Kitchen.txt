The set dinner was not bad. Good chicken and briyani rice. But the waitress not fluent in English and unfamiliar with the set menu.
5
So love Zaffron kitchen first class in all departments. Will definitely come back here on next visit to Singapore. Lovely experience
5
Every single staff was attentive. The manager Mr Chandra was really friendly and accomodating. Highly recommended!
5
Food is great, good menu and the lunch sets are very reasonably priced, good size portions, staff are great, helpful and friendly. Nice comfortable space, quite big so good for accommodating large groups.

I had dinner by myself at this Indian restaurant. The service is very good, the staff friendly and very flexible if you want to make substitutions to any item on the menu. I have a tandoor plater and garlic naan, it was delicious. Highly recommended.
3
While the curry is excellent, the experience is spoiled somewhat by the proprietor squeezing so many tables into the dining space that one has to frequently stand to let others through to access their table or bathroom.
4
Big portions and good quality food. Good service. A bit expensive.
Very delicious food, reasonable quantity, friendly staff
3
Only Tandoori Items. Was looking for Soup but they don't serve.
Taste of food is OK type. Not so exceptional to attract.
4
Have been to Zaffron multiple times as the food is really tasty. Especially recommend the dum chicken biryani, butter chicken and garlic naan. Only thing, I wish they would turn down the aircon as the wind is very strong wherever I sit, making the food turn cold very quickly.

My family is not a fan of Indian food, but thought we would give this place a try, since it has won several awards. The nan and curry dishes were good but overall, we were quite disappointed with the food (we didn't like the starter set, the vegetables...). Well, we may have set our expectations too high (after reading the reviews?!) or it may just be that we don't fancy Indian food
5
Nice location with easy parking near the vicinity. I simply love the Palak Paneer! Nice creamy sauce with firm and delicious paneer. The naans are good too. Freshly made.
4
Great location and awesome taste. The butter chicken was our favorite. The week day set lunch was great for easy meal!
4
Great food, great service, polite, friendly and prompt acting staff. Many items on the menu and reasonably priced.
5
The food packs the punch but is not taxing on the stomach. Awesome variety and great quality of basmati rice used in the briyani! Very child friendly...cozy environment... found a new fav for Indian food!
5
I'm not a huge fan of spicy food so I don't usually like Indian food (or Thai, etc), but I love eating at Zaffron. The food is just amazing.
5
Been back over and over and over and over again.... Yes there were some inconsistencies in service levels but the food has always been good.
3
Went to this place for family dinner , food was simply delicious.Loved their lamb shank biryani and kebabs platter . Chicken tikka awesome. However , was disappointed with the service and waiting time for order to come ( our stRter arrived after 40-45 mins of waiting )Next time I would rather pack the food
1
Having driven past this place multiple times, my partner and I decide to give it a try on New Year's. Being our first time, my partner and I walked in on without reservation at 6.30pm to a pretty vacant place with a few families, seated quickly but menus(ipads in a wooden box) took more than 20 minutes before we could get hold of one. A couple who were seated inside after us had a menu handed to them immediately.I caught the attention of the Assistant Manager dressed in black and told him that we were still waiting to have a look at what's on offer(apart from the table standee promoting their Michenlin Set, which was not appealing to us for that price point); he waltzed along to grab one and handed one to us. Here's where his customer service went to pieces, all my partner asked was why did it take so long to be handed a menu and the priority of service went to the couple after us. This is the dialogue that followed:Manager: "Well we do not keep track of who walks in first, we are so busy"Partner: "Do you only have a few working ipads? (there was a bunch of them lying down on the service table near the kitchen pick up, I'm presuming all drained out.)Manager: "We have been busy the whole day and have not been able to charge them."Me: "Shouldn't you guys have portable chargers for days like this? It can not be the first time to be so busy."Partner: "I think 20 minutes is a tad too long to be just be handed a menu"Manager: "Look, if you want to go, you can just go, if you want to eat here you have to wait, we are very busy."Not once did the manager apologise, and I'm sorry, if a food establishment is busy running from lunch service till closing, that should be a good indication that you are doing something right and you should be prepared to be on your toes because your business is good! They had 1 Asst Manger, 1 cashier lady, and 2-3 servers. The bill came faster than we could guesture for it, maybe the cashier lady should lend a helping hand in the service.And the problem when you have electronic menus is battery life and that should have been thought out, or at the very least have a hardcopy menu as backup; I'm sure you started with a hardcopy folder before switching to an app based system. Also, the menus had no description of the ingredients, we had to Google the dishes to find out what was what.We, a handful of other couples and the food delivery pick up guys spent the next hour waiting and observing how other patrons were eagle-eyed by waiters to minimise their usage of the limited number of ipads so that it could passed along like some sort of musical chair(ipad).Food wise, it was all good as it seemed like each dish was only prepared when ordered which added to the wait times as well, this on top of the fact that dine in patrons were also "competing" with the food delivery pick up guys did not help with the wait. Quality is the reason that they were awared the Michelin review but quantity wise for the price seems a bit lacking; but enough for a couple.Overall, I would recommend it for the quality of food, only if you'd be willing to wait out and the inconsistent customer service, but I might consider ordering from the food delivery apps to bypass all this hassle
5
Had a very good experience at this restaurant ... we arrived an hour earlier than our reserved time, but they managed to get us a seat. Order was taken efficiently by the manager who provided recommendations based on our preferences. Food was served quite quickly, and everything we had were excellent (tandoori chicken, lamb kebab, fish tikka, cauliflower, paneer with curry, Chick peas with curry, a mix of different naans, and briyani rice). One of the best Indian food we had
5
This is such a great place if you are a lover of Indian food. Though I am not a fan of Indian food, coming here is no regret. I loved the butter chicken curry sauce that comes with the prata. The place is not that big so if you come in a big group, is better to make a reservation. I can also see the display of awards this restuarant had
5
Usually come here for the butter chicken and naan. This time we tried the briyani which was really fragrant!
4
Food was great and service was also superb. A little on the high side for me (we spent $80+ between 2 people), but nevertheless food quality was refined and delicious. I imagine this place would be good for special occasions.
4
Great lunch with business associates. We had very good food in a nice ambience. Service was reasonable and prices were competitive!
4
What a lovely surprise, the food is better than we expected, all nicely spiced and delicious. Our guest from India said the dishes are indeed authentic. It did get very busy and noisy, and the service slowed down, but still acceptable. We will be back!
4
We loved our food, the restaurant is located in a very pleasant area!
The staff are five stars!!! Especially Mr. HARI, he welcomed us very very well.
Highly recommend!!
5
I was thrilled to not only discover a new area of Singapore, namely Katong but to also have one of the best Indian dinners I have experienced . It is a cuisine I love but alas it is often too oily, this was first class . The wines were very reasonable , and the service was very attentive . I would go back there without hesitation.
3
We remember Zaffron as a place to go back to for Indian food as we have enjoyed the food there previously, hence we decided to celebrate Diwali there. However we were disappointed with our orders, a fish, prawn and vegetable tandoor with some naan. The fish and prawns were far from fresh and to pay $35 for a platter of vegetable tandoor was a little outrageous
4
I first visited the restaurant 5 years back and their food and service really impressed me! And I went back their with friends on last sat night to have a chill night with friends. The food there is super delicious as usual. I love their Tandoori Mixed Grill!! It's really the best I've ever had! And the butter chicken is a perfect match with Naan!. Highly recommend !However the service wise is not as good as expected. The restaurant use Ipad for ordering and there were something wrong with the Ipad for our table. Instead of giving us another Ipad to continue our order the shop took more than 15 min just to fix the Ipad. No waiter was serving us nor taking order manually. During the dinner there was no waiter helps us refill our cups and when we request something they always tend to do other stuffs first and attend to us when we make the second request. The managers were very efficient tho, always attend to our needs very fast and with good quality
5
Luckily we came upon this restaurant by chance and it was one of the best meals I had whilst we were travelling......just writing about it now I'm back home is making my taste buds water. Hari made us feel welcome although all the staff were very friendly....a thoroughly enjoyable evening. The restaurant is also situated in an interestingly historical area
5
Ordered the platter to try a bit of everything...wow! Thoroughly enjoyed the explosion of aromatic spices. The tandoori chicken was as close to perfection as one could get. I also loved the palak paneer..very very good. Will definitely return to try the other items on the menu
5
Love the food here.
Favs are butter chicken as they use tandoori chicken yum.
You can get you variety of tandoori to satisfy your pallet. There is a glass panel so you can see them prep.
5
As usual, Zaffron doesn't disappoint. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Kashimiri Naan, Seafood Vindaloo and french fries. All of the dishes were to the point.
4
Great North Indian cuisine. Service was very good and very impressed with the use of Android tablets for customers to place orders.
Reasonably priced, great selection and amazing presentation of food.
4
The tandoori fish was good and the Dahl was amazing! We enjoyed our visit. They were great with our kids. We would return.
4
Great food but the service was a bit lacking, maybe as it was Saturday night. Digital menu was very confusing and most wines out of stock. Hard to get any attention.
5
Head to Zaffron Kitchen for the best Indian food. Family, birthday or with friends, whatever the occasion is, the food will not disappoint you. It is a Michelin guide restaurant
5
My daughter loves the food here and so this is a place we go to on her every visit from London. Food and the service never disappoint us.
4
The food is tasty, service not so much. The kids menu definitely needs some improvement. We liked the system of placing the order on tablets.
4
Lunchtime on a weekend. We went in quite late, ordered a nice red, and waited for kebabs and biryani. The dum biryani was flavourful, and not at all greasy (only mentioning this because some treatments of the slow cooked rice and meat dish can be heavy-handed) - we went for seconds. The seekh kebab was a bit dry, but I wouldn't diss it before trying again. Interior red brick and casual/modern seating make it a nice, approachable space. Dessert - moong dal halwa with vanilla ice-cream was lovely. No complaints, but also no major drama about the michelin star
4
My second time at Zaffron and I was not disappointed by the taste of the food. However, as with my first visit, the food took a long while to be served. Even getting the bill required patience. It would be great if they could improve their service timing to elevate the customer experience even more
4
Yet the dum briyani taste good. Speaks for itself. Ambience is modern... ask for the seats at the corner near the children play section if you have 8 to 10 pax.. more privacy.
1
We just had dinner yesterday and my child fell ill with 39 degrees Celsius now! The play area looked dirty and the toilets were unclean n unflushed! I am so upset now!! I really regret bringing my child here for dinner!!
5
Excellent service. Delicious food. The naan and the briyani are flavorful. Even has a place for kids to play. Highly recommended.
5
Great Indian food and would highly recommend it. Was quite crowded and parking and traffic in that area is always a challenge - but definitely worth it :-)
3
The food was great. But seriously have to improve on "their" service. I say "their" because it's not really their fault. Went there and they didn't know of my reservation. (I had an issue once when I went to the tavern with a reservation and was told that they were closed for a private function.) 6 of us had to share a table for four people. There wasn't enough space at the table for the food and so I had to sit out one of the courses - So that my five other guests could have space for their plates. The staff were apologetic and did what they could. So I'm not really pissed with them. But more so with the second screwup with the chope app.
4
Came for dinner, the place was packed! We ordered a naan, sweet laasi, tandoori chicken and paleek paneer to share. Everything was so well done, delicious and super tasty. The chicken was just nice and the marinade had penetrated well. The naan was so good and the paleek paneer was fantastic, full of chunks of delicious paneer and it had a great flavor and texture. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The only downside was the speed of the food was a bit slow because the kitchen was so busy making orders for delivery too
5
ZK has outstanding Indian food. We had the dahi chat as a starter followed by fish tikka, butter paneer and garlic naans. Dessert was kulfi. Everything we ate was excellent. The garlic naans were soft and fluffy and the fish was tender. The food was not overwhelmed with spices and was just right. We will return!!
4
The ambience was really nice, we were celebrating my mum's birthday and it was a great spot for that. The Dum Briyani was definitely the highlight of the night. Meat was tender and the rice, full of flavour. My personal favourite is the Chicken Saag - super tasty! I'd definitely go back. I also loved the service! Read prior reviews that the service was bad, but I thought it was pretty good! A little slow, but the waiters were super friendly and helpful!
5
Food was great. Extremely crowded, luckily they allow reservations. We ordered Briyani, Fish Tikka, Gobi (Cauliflower) Masala & a Chana (Chickpeas) Masala. All were very good. Service was great despite the huge crowd too. Wanted to order an extra Prawn dish but the staff said what we ordered was already enough for 2. I spilled my drink accidentally and they replaced one FOC. Price was reasonable for Michelin standard food. So quality, service & price are all great. Will definitely return
4
Clean environment, good service from staff. While the order process is self service using the iPad, there's only one per table and it's impossible for a group of people to browse at the same time. Would be nice if they had regular hard copy menu as well. Food tastes good as expected, though if I had to be picky, the garlic naan was a little bit oily though.
4
Love the food at Zaffron Kitchen. Best Indian food in the East area. Favorites are Butter chicken, Chicken Tikka, Raita, Palak Paneer.
It's a little pricey for Indian food, but really good!
5
Awesome food -- the lamb shank biryani was divine as was the Malai tikka. Loved the Masala tea and gajar ka halwa. Ros, the supervisor there, was brilliant.
4
Zaffron kitchen is one of the best Indian restaurants I've visited. Hands down one of the most family-friendly and service-oriented dining places.
4
Food is worthy of Michelin but not the decor nor the service.Place kinda cramp hence not really comfortable and they try to put onto a table just sufficient. Nice little child corner though. Cannot fault the food. Very delicious and the masala tea is just nice, not too sweet
5
Great Michelin set menu for 2. I must say that the seekh mutton kebab is really good. I'm not a lamb person but the kebab is so good that it has no smell & taste of lamb. Service is good and waiter is attentive. I was there at 6pm before the dinner crowd. My food arrived quite fast but the dessert took a while (say 10min) to arrive due to the dinner crowd
1
Saturday night dinner was a disaster . All who ate the mutton briani and buttered chicken came down with food poisoning . The next day called manager to inform him what had happened . He wasn't in . Spoke to rose to relay message and to call me but till today Tuesday no call . We have been to the doctors twice !!!!!!! Will inform NEA of this matter . Most irresponsible of the management to ignore our complain . They need to be taught Food Safety and be responsible for their dinners .Most disappointed . Debra
3
A little bit disappointing stay - actually we were told that the restaurant had one Michelin star, hence we thought it might be a good choice for tonight's business dinner. Unfortunately, service was not very focused in the beginning (however improved over dinner) - at the same time, food was ok but definitely not at all outstanding
4
So this is a great Indian. Even though I'd say the spice has been toned down the food is delicious. I started with samosa, generous portions and delicious although slightly too bland for me. The basmati rice was lovely as was the chicken from the tandoor. I have been here a while ago on a previous business trip. And it wasn't quite a super yummy as I revered I still say go, it's great.
5
Me, my wife and our three boys came for dessert at around 9.30pm, the staffs greeted us with professional and friendly manners. We were decided to sat at one round table closer to the kids play corner (well thought for family with kids), within few minutes a waiter came and took our order and politely explained that it was the last call but we were there for a dessert instead. Overall it was short and sweet experience from start to finish. Will definitely come back!
5
All the service staff were friendly especially their manager Mr. CHANDRA. From my first step into the restaurant until I left the service was what you would dream about but at Saffron it was real. To top up an enjoyable afternoon was the food. It was super delicious and value for your money. I will recommended you try this restaurant and you will enjoy your visit and will not forget the experience you get
4
One of the best indian foodyou can find in singapore. On the pricier side but at least you know you will enjoy yourself for sure.
5
Had vegetarian food here couple of times. Good north Indian dishes. Loved the paneer gravies n Kulchas.
5
Went there tonight with a few friends and a 15 month old baby. Highly recommend this place. Amazing food, friendly staff with excellent service. Additionally this is a very child friendly place. Would come here again..
5
The garlic naan was excellent. Highly recommended. The service was fast, waitresses courteous. Will surely come back when in Singapore.
1
Party of 7 with kids, waiter's response is very slow/bad, food waiting time is awful, starter order arrived after main course, Food taste doesn't meet expectations at all, Biryani served like in the food court, "when asked why they u didn't serve in ceramic bowl(which seems their standard) with Nan on top, the answer is bowls ran out" , Wont recommend and wont visit this place again, Sorry!
5
This was our second time eating at Zaffron kitchen and it tasted just as delicious. We ordered the garlic naan, butter chicken and some vegetable dish that was green (can't remember the name). I'm a picky eater and loved all the dishes. Pity that we were so full that we didn't have space for dessert
5
We visited Zaffron kitchen with 4 friends and an 18 months old baby. While Zaffron serves tasty, good quality indian food, I would come back here because of their exceptional service. The staff was kind and considerate, even when the baby puked. This place is really kids friendly. They were prompt with their service and accommodated our requests. This is sometimes hard to find in singapore. Great job guys! Keep up the good work
3
It is in a great location on the corner of East Coast Road and Joo Chiat Road.Inside is a good bustling ambience, the restaurant often seems to be busy and the service is quick and efficient. It was quite suitable for a larger gathering we were about 10 people.Food wise, there are all the classic Indian dishes available here and they are tasty enough. But nothing special. In Singapore you have loads of fantastic Indian options. And at a range of different prices. Zaffron would certainly be towards the higher end of the pricing scale. This is why I would give a rating of 3
3
Went with a group of friends (7 of us) and we were told it was 141 beers, great so we ordered a round. We waiting a fairly long while for that so double ordered next time thinking it would solve the problem but it only seemed to make it slower.Food tasted nice, no complaints about that.Rice came basically last once we had all but finished (what's the point in even bringing it at all?). Maybe there's a hint of western style of wanting a rice with a curry but still.It's fine, not amazing. With better service, i.e. staff not standing around doing nothing when they could be serving, might get a 4
4
Being vegetarian I liked the tandoor starters and briyani very much. Ambience is good! there is a play area, so me and hubby could eat in peace while Daughter was playing happily. Coming to the drawbacks, we didn't like some of the Indian street food (snacks) and service is not good(with experience of more than two visits); there was always shortage of service people, so everything was delayed
4
Was there on a weekend, not too crowded and service was prompt. Food is of a fair portion for 2. Did not choose the set as the appetiser and dessert selection was not to liking.
4
Vegetarian feast for us on a Sunday night, including the tired toddler.
Lots of curries and naan bread, pappadam and basmati rice, all delicious and very filling.
Vegetable briyani highly recommended, very interesting dish.
Children's entertainment area is good fun, too.
1
I booked online but when we reached there they said they don't accept online booking. Somehow we got the place. Ordered veg food. Taste was not good.
4
Satisfying meal but we were brought the bill before we finished our meal (it wasn't even ours), and then again the wrong table's bill when we called for it at the end
4
Service and atmosphere was good. Food was delicious however the portion were a little small. Will be back for the next time
5
I ordered the lamb shank briyani and was so glad I did! It was definitely the best I had eaten! The lamb was juicy and tender and the rice fluffy. Definitely a must-try!
4
I took a friend from abroad who was visiting a few days here along with my family on a Saturday night. The food was all very good, different tastes to each dish and the bread was amazing. We all enjoyed our meal. We did have quite a long wait for food.There is a kiddie play area, which was great for my four year old, but means parents with little 'uns will always be present, and it can get quite noisy. Though was not too bad on this visit
3
We were there at off-peak hours with only 3 other tables occupied and we got pretty good service. The team there was warm, friendly and had lots of recommendations. I picked the crayfish briyani because not many Indian places have this. The crayfish didn't taste so fresh, and it was quite overcooked. The rice was quite good though. My friend ordered a half chicken tandoori which was nice and also the masala fries which was nothing to shout about. The menu said it comes with assorted chutney.. but all we got was ketchup
4
If you craving for some authentic Indian food outside India, look no further than this. Fine choice of selection, perfectly executed. In simple words Medley of flavours and Aroma.Interior is shabby & chairs are definitely not comfortable, but you can bear some pain in rear than its bang for the mone
2
Visited the Zaffron with family last weekend during lunch time. The main reason was the food, the second was the nice little play area for kids. The restaurant itself looks pretty modern with a nice contemporary interior design. Order is done via ipad which I find a bit strange for a Michelin featured restaurant. And each table gets only one ipad which creates waiting time for the others since you cannot use simultaneously. Plus, no personal interaction and no recommendations by staff. Menu has way too much offerings. And this should be red flag. We ordered various chicken, mutton curries but all tasted like the chicken (which was apparently not breast, I'd rather say tigh) was prepared before and was just put into the heated sauce. It tasted definitely not freshly prepared. Given the 12 minutes for the food to be at our table, it cannot be freshly made. After having looked into the kitchen, it rather looked like hawker style pre-prepared food like in a cantina. Taste of food was therefore 2 out of 5. I just gave 2 out of 5 because of interior design and kids play area. Save your money and go for other options like the infamous mustard in Little India !
3
My overall experience is good! Looking forward to go once in 3 months with my family and friends!
Slightly expensive 😜
4
The restaurant served very nice food but my reservation was not recorded in their list, sadly got assigned to table near washroom, ambience wasn't that fantastic near washroom. However overall food is great, service so-so
5
I am not a fan of Indian food but this restaurant has changed my attitude towards Indian food. My host suggested I try some basics like the butter chicken, the goat cheese gravy, and the garlic and butter naans. We topped it off with the dum bryani which was baked with a naan covering the top part of the bowl. We also ordered the lamb shank and the vegetarian platter. There was also the usual meat platters with chicken, mutton and fish. While some of us ordered red wine I stuck with the conservative sparkling water. I heard there were some complaints about water being charged for and poor service and long wait times it was not the case tonight. It was surely one of my best outings at a restaurant. Would recommend this place as its family friendly and with clean toilets too
4
One of the good Indian restaurants in Singapore. Their snacks are especially good. It is located in the busy East Coast road with lots of eateries but still deserves a visit. They have a nice play area for children, which helps a lot if visiting with children. Service is good
3
Heard a lot of this place and from many people.Staff is excellent, friendly and very accommodative.Food was not as per expectations, especially tandoori items. We ordered tandoori tikka, it took 30 minutes for them to prepare and that too under cooked.Was expecting better food... disappointed
4
The food was fantastic. Colours, smells, taste.... there was hardly anything to fault with that. We ordered the meat platter, butter chicken, mutton, and all the various types of Naan. All delicious, all delivered within 20 minutes (it was a very big order). The service was very friendly. Everyone smiled, attended to us promptly, no frowns, no tired shrugs, all professional and pleasant. One cannot underestimate how important this factor is in the overall dining experience.My only complaint is that it took 15 minutes to get our first jug of beer, and that we were asked several times how big our party was even though we had made reservations (we didn't know the overall size because the friend who made the reservation hadn't arrived yet). Turns out, they wanted to give us a cosier corner for our group (but this was only explained to us later after we had seated down at our original reserved table). This however, again, shows how good and conscientious the service overall was.Food is upper mid-range pricey: about $17 for a curry. For our group of 10+2, with 2 jugs of beer, the bill came to about $300. Definitely recommended if you want good Indian food, but restaurant style environment. Can't compete with those who want cheap authentic Indian cuisine in the back alleys of little India, though.(I apologise for the half-baked photos... the food was so yummy we couldn't wait!
3
Nice food, nothing to rave about that is "Mitchelin". We waited close to an hour for starters (papadum) which they didn't even need to cook, just serve! Our main came close to an house after that. When we asked for water to be served, we were told by the waiter 'I only serve food today, not drinks'. Only the paid drinks came swiftly. Wait stuff was also slow to clear empty dishes and cups to make room on the table for new dishes. Just poor management overal
4
Nicely decorated modern Indian style restaurant with tasty food for those who do like spicy food. Food is fusion Indian not traditional Indian and good for people with different taste. Very well trained staff who will recommend dishes that suits your appettie, number in the group and size of portions. 餐厅装修为现代印度风风格，餐饮为混合印度使式适合。服务培训足够而会造你你的人数，味道爱好，来介绍菜
3
Food is amazing, came with friends and kids, nice atmosphere with kids' playground. I tried butter chicken and chicken tikka and some plain and garlic naan to eat with. Lesser star due to bad service as we had waited 4 glasses of water only to be served at the end while we finished all our food, and they didn't serve one of the dishes until we have constantly reminded them. With a Michelin star restaurant we expect the service to be more top notch. More to be improved
5
Give a thumb up.The Indian food here are better than the Indian food I've ever eat in other Indian restaurants. The price is reasonable but slightly on the high side, but the quality would trade off the high side of it.One thing is their ordering system seems very limited and hard to use. It takes a little while to get the iPad and make the order. Hope the owner can improve this
5
Ordered the dum chicken biryani, fish tikka, garlic naan, salted lassi, masala chai and house pour. Brilliant dishes with balanced flavours. Perfect flavour symphony in a pleasant dining setting. Not over greasy or over powering. Masala chai was perfect! Already planning my next visit.
4
Really good indian food. Service can be better. The michelin menu has a bit of everything. Don't really appreciate the indian version of chendol dessert. Too sweet. Lamb shank briyani was dayuuum.
4
Great traditional Indian food, friendly and helpful service. Great value. Pity the restaurant was very quiet so not too much atmosphere but otherwise great.
4
This restaurant was recently awarded one Michellin star. The Mango lassi was nice and balanced. We had the butter chicken, mutton masala, lamb shank biryani, palak paneer and jaipuri vegetable. Good service.
4
Good food and reasonable prices but under-staffed so had to follow up a few times to get all the items. but we were in a large group of 15 pax.
4
The food was excellent and the ambience added to the good service.
We were on a business lunch and our colleagues loved it.
5
Very good food with improved service time. Can't complain! I would recommend this restaurant to all Indian food lovers.
4
Zaffron kitchen left me mesmerising. Starting with the ordering menu itself which was a tablet with pics of the dishes and an accompanying few lines about it neatly arranged. The adjoin bar is well stacked with a choice of liquour too. Although it was pretty pricey, the Dum Biriyani which we had ordered wasn’t up to the mark. The owner said that since he caters to people who aren’t so used to spicy food he has to tone down the heat index.
3
Sometimes you just walk in a restaurant and feel at home- This is not one such place. The restaurant owners should realize in India we use food to heat your heart and then fill your stomach. Certainly your Ipad service, incongruent service who do not seem to deeply care for the business and simply do their job to get by are problems to just to begin with.The tandoori items are not bad at all. However, their notion of spiciness is grossly ill-defined. When u ask for more spicy- you expect something to tingle the indian taste buds making you feel the not the heat but the punch of our rich spicy heritage.The main issue is - the place is running by virtue of its location advantage and previous good will. What is lacks is a good restaurant manager who puts in a heart to get the warmth of a fine Indian food eatery , motivate the staff to make cutomers enjoy the experience. If that happens maybe, I can deal with the prices and say it is justified but just like it is now- it is simply as the title say- a failed marriage which started with a big fat wedding and just not worth it

Everyone knows their service is very poor - just look at the other reviews - but our kids insisted they wanted to go for the play area. Firstly the ipad ordering system is a disaster. Completely non-intuitive and half the options are not available. Even the staff appear not to trust it, as they kept asking whether we'd ordered! Please get rid of the ipads and just use proper paper menus. Service might have been ok if it had been the same member of staff who served us throughout, but we had 4 different people come to the table, either trying to push the same Michelin special on us or contradicting each other (do the dishes include the rice? One said yes, but it turned out no). Then the food. OK, but the spicy chicken dish I had was just two tiny pieces of bony chicken floating in a spicy gravy with the consistency of a soupy broth. But the kids area is great.

Food was pretty good and authentic (but does not taste as strong as what i had in India a month back). Slightly pricey too considering the portion.
3
A nice restaurant with a good athmosphere and also a good service. The food however is not so special. Spicy is not spicy at all and the ingredients seemed only of average quality. Was disappointed.
1
Very terrible service! A simple glass of warm water took them more than 15 minutes. Very unfriendly staff! WILL NOT RECOMMEND!
4
probably the best indian restaurant in the east so we love to come here for a butter chicken and naan fix although it's relatively expensive.
2
In a vicinity where Indian restaurant options are plentiful one would have thought that Zaffron Kitchen's bill of fare would be decent, unfortunately that isn't the case...
Our entrées were uninspired and insipid. Coupled with lousy service this one is certainly avoidable..
4
We went on recommendation of the Michelin Bib Gourmand list. The food was succulent and well spiced, but we found it a little disconcerting to order by ipad and it took us several minutes to work out how to navigate the menu and then how to place an order. As we were recently arrived in Singapore, we would have also ave welcomed the chance to discuss the choices, but waiting staff were conspicuous by their absence.Recommended for the tandoori foods which were excellent.
4
We have been quiet frequent to this restaurant ever since we discovered it.Their kebabs are really nice.Though we usually go ala carte, we did try their veg and non veg set lunch and i have to admit the taste was just as nice.They have a wide variety of Chaats, kebabs and gravies to choose from. The main course has a lot of good option but i didnt find anything really as remarkable as the snack and kebabs.I would always go back to them for snacks, chaats and kebabs.But mind you, the outlet in Westgate is not a kid friendly place as its very small and quiet cramped up
5
The restaurant has enjoyed a huge surge of popularity since it earned its bib gourmand honour. Reservations are a must, or you might be in for a wait. The food is wonderfully spiced and flavoured, and hits all the right notes. Service was prompt and all in all, the meal was great
3
Good variety of food, and nice ambiance. Taste-wise its decent also.But if you are an Indian, and you already have high standards on Indian food, forget this place. It is customized for Asian and European consumers, and the spices are appropriately reduced. I had a dum biriyani which absolutely felt like half salted and half spiced. Worst thing is the service. We don't have any special requests - like less spicy,more spicy,hot water,remove this item from dish..anything.. Minimum we expected was that they give plates first, starters next and main course last. Instead, the waiter brought starters and main course together, kept everything in the table (which was small - a table for two), and then brought us plates, and finally the glasses of water. He kept everything in the available space in the table and left.. That's all!So if you want to ask the waiter questions like "what is the special item today", or "is this gravy spicy or sweet".. sorry, you wont have anyone.
3
In this tasty Indian restaurant you'll order via iPads, as it is maybe for saving staff cost, it affects the service because clearly there is not enough staff to cover the floor and whole experience is unorganised chaos.That said food is totally worth of going to this place for, just don't expect that special moment...
3
We waited for more than one hour for our food - the longest I have waited for four indian food dishes.
1
The experience at their Westgate branch was a better one for me. Service can be more prompt for a cosy joint like this. Patience runs dry quickly when food is ready but just left there when there isn't a crowd as yet. Senior staff (lady) could mellow down her tension with Chefs. Open kitchen means everything is visible (and audible as well).
4
Went there during this first weekend of August.Took the waiter a few minutes to arrive, but he was very polite, and our orders came quick.Nice touch is that you order through a tablet, which contains the menu;The garlic and butter naan were delicious, as were our main dishes.My three recommendations to improve this nice place even more would be:1 - It's an Indian Restaurant, you guys could focus more on indian beers as well (they only have 1 kind of Kingfisher, and they were OUT).2 - Perhaps the waiters could be more aware of people arriving at the place, to prevent long waits for menu and service.3 - picture of the dishes of the menu - come on guys, the cover of the menu on the tablet looks amazing with all these colourful spices and ingredients. Add the pics for each individual option on the menu and it will be perfect
2
We had : Palak paneer- this came barely Luke warm . Lack taste.. Bland Butter chicken- nothing wow was just okay. Masala mutton- only one was a little bit better than okay Garlic naan- ordered first round, was under cooked and doughy . Second order after telling the waiter I don't like raw flour taste was slightly better Butter naan- was meh. For the dishes above and 2 drink set u back 88 bucks. Not cheap for this quality. Definitely not coming back ...

I visited Zaffron for a business dinner. The staff is not very good. It seems it is a burden for them to serve .... no smile..no energy...and soooooo slow. It takes 10-20 min to get one beer. It was happy hour...but the barman was not happy !Food is average to good..
2
Zaffron Kitchen received Bib Gourmand from Michelin's Singapore Guide recently so we paid a visit. And the experience made me doubt about Michelin's entire inspection review process. Take a look at the most recent reviews of the restaurant, there is a consensus about the poor service. We two adults and two kids (10 & 8) spent almost a S$100 on the food and we were only half full. And yet Michelin awarded the venue a Bid Goumand (defined as exceptionally good food at moderate price). I say there are many more deserving eateries in Singapore than Zaffron.At the dinner, I noted two obvious reasons for the slow service: apparent shortage of waiters, bar tenders and cashiers (3 in total to look after 50+ seats). Two cooks in the kitchen and yet they have to fill orders from both the eat-ins and deliveries!While the taste is decent, the food comes in such small quantities that my two kids find them wanting. The price, relatively to the quantity, is therefore by no means modest at all. It is amazing that the Michelin Singapore Guide could be so off the mark ..
2
There was literally no food coming out of the kitchen. Amazingly the entire restaurant had been waiting long for their order. Looking at some of the earlier comments it seems that the management is not keen to improve their service. They don't know how to get it right. Disappointed. Don't think I would like to wait that long for food only if this was the last place on earth
2
My colleague recommended this place so I went. We placed our order and were excited to try out the food! The food took ONE HOUR to arrive. I understand that sometimes, yes, due to unforeseen circumstances, it can be delayed - what really got to us was the poor service - When we had enquired about our order, they only said that "it was coming". As it was taking too long, we had asked for some papadums while we waited. They refused. We said we would pay for the papadums. Even then they were reluctant to give us the papadums!!?? As so many other patrons were complaining, they eventually gave us some papadums (2 only). By the time the food came, we were ravenous but didn't dare order any more. Whilst the food was tasty, it was not worth the one hour wait. Plus, if you think they are generous with their portion sizes, they are not. I would not come back to this place. In fact, I would choose Muthu's curry over this place any day.
4
We come here about once every three months, we really like the food and the atmosphere. The decor is very modern. It can be a bit noisy at times so maybe I would recommend to go during the week instead. However, I have seen that they do not serve free ice water anymore, which is a bit of a joke especially if you order food anyways. A little mineral water of 300ml is SGD4...
1
This was a big disappointment, we got recommended the Zaffron Kitchen Meat Platter, and all the varieties of meat turned out to be too salty. This was made worse, when we were told that no ice water was served in the restaurant. I have no problem paying for ice water, but I strongly object to buy water imported in bottles all the way from Italy, when we have some of the best tapwater around. The garlic nan was too oily. The total bill for 4 persons was $ 116 including one drink. (a draft 330ml draft beer at $16++). Exorbitant. All in all a forgettable evening - Not recommended
4
Good food at relatively good price for the location. A little corner for the kids which my son loves. When it gets crowded the staff can get overwhelmed, need to pay more attention to the customer.
5
Great set lunch menu, tried out their vegetarian and butter chicken lunch sets consisting of a few selections of curry, naan and briyani rice.. The former priced at an affordable $14.90 and the latter at $15.90, really rich curry packed with strong spice flavors.
4
Celebrated my close friend's birthday here and the food was excellent. Very nice Indian cuisine and wines are reasonably priced :) the mixed platter was excellent and we like the spinach chicken dish. Will definitely come back!
4
I've been to Zaffron Kitchen on a few occasions and it has yet to disappoint! The lunch specials are amazing value - an enormous amount of really good food for less than $15. Dinner is also very good value, service is pretty quick and the staff are all super friendly and helpful. Located in the heart of East Coast Road it is surrounded by places to explore, eat and drink. Have a look around Joo Chiat Road and stop off at Zaffron Kitchen for a fabulous lunch to keep you going the rest of the day

I could copy-paste some comments of other visitors of Zaffron. The food is delicious. All we had was tasty and we above all enjoyed the Tandoori dishes. But the service is just incredibly poor. I reserved a table, got a SMS validation but there was no table available for us when we arrived. We sometimes waited ages till we got what we ordered or till the bill was prepared. There is one head-waiter (unfriendly and overloaded) and two helpers which is not at all enough to properly serve the amount of tables available. It cannot be that expense to hire two more helpers and it would make everybody less stressed and more happy
5
I've been heading down to Zaffron multiple times since I've moved to the East. Hands down one of the best places for North Indian food. Brought my family over and they loved it. The mutton biriyani is amazing. Mutton is cooked to perfection. The briyani here is way better than the other well know one out there like Islamic Briyani etc
5
Indian food is the BOMB! One of the greatest thing on this tiny island is that many Indians live here and share their culinary art and talents for the pleasure of all the lovers of tasty and colorful food out there. We went to have lunch at Zaffron Kitchen a week ago and it has been a really pleasant experience. The food was really tasty and yummy! We had a platter of mixed meats accompanied with some nature and butter Nans and Biryani rice. Just writing about it makes me wish I was back there and could reorder the exact same food! Apart from some places in Little India, this restaurant is definitely one of my favorite in SG! Additionally, Zaffron Kitchen has a charming and welcoming atmosphere and a great style too. The staff was welcoming and the service was one of the best experienced in SG so far. I already look forward to our next visit there! :) I am happy to share some pictures with you beautiful people! :) For more pictures and reviews > you can follow me on nstagram: Cindycocofollonie

I must admit, I went to Zaffron with huge expectations. The food is incredibly over priced. They do not even serve a glass of water, one has to purchase small water bottles for $4 each. By the end of the meal, we had purchased 8 bottles. The service itself was disappointing for a fine dine restaurant. No concept of serving, etc.All in all, a disappointing experience.
4
Visit Zaffron Kitchen for Sunday lunch.Almost 40% customer in restaurant at 12:00 on Sunday.Use iPad for order so you can refer photo.Operation is very slow takes 20-30 minutes until serve.Food is very good also soft naan.No spicy, if you like spicy food should better ask to add chili.One of problem for food is drink is too sweet even hot coffee
4
The small indoor play area for children was a deal breaker but the food was nothing short of delicious! Great indian cuisine - authentic and affordable. A family venue for sure!service can be a bit slow but it sure gives you time to savor the dishes
4
I have a reservation several days before but when I went there, my name was not on the reservation list. Nonetheless, the manager gave us a table. Everything was well except they should make sure their reservation system does not go wrong.
4
Service was great. The staff was cheerful and seemed to enjoy working as we saw them chatting and bantering as the served. The food was very good. Very authentic. Enjoyed ourselves immensely.
4
I liked basically every one of the 6 dishes we tried! We spent about 60 S dollars but I was really happy about it!
4
After I had made my reservations I was almost put off by negative reviews here but gave it a try nonetheless. We had chicken tikka tandoori, Goan fish curry and some vegetable curry with naan. It all tasted very good. This is not a cheap place to eat - it is mid - market. Expect to spend about 25 dollars a head without drinks. I see lots of reviews about bad service. My experience was to the contrary - my reservation was taken with a smile by the manager and that night we were served by pleasant smiling staff. My mum enjoyed it.
3
Hard to know what score to give this place to be honest. Here are my thoughts:Very very good food. Really good.Surly service, not friendly at all.Very very rule based. Can't do anything different to help customers (typical in Singapore)Expensive, especially given the location.Nice little play area kept the kids busy.No free tap water and overpriced drinks.They could make this into an amazing restaurant by teaching the staff to be friendly, giving some flexibility for customers, and bringing back free water
5
Love the food at Zaffron. Clean kitchen, clean restaurant and great food. Love how your select your food on their I-pad. But service is slow, staff can be a little bit more welcoming. Something the owner may need to check on. You want customers to keep coming back. We love the food, so we'll come back.
3
The food as ever was excellent but the restaurant for the second time I have booked seemed to have no idea about the booking and my family was made to wait while they scurried around trying to find a table for them. It was also incredibly noisy as they mix the area of families with children in the play area with the rest of the diners. My family literally could not hear each other talking
4
We were desperate to find a meal with our jet lagged vegan teen, admittedly late in the evening and were very lucky to find Zaffron Kitchen still open. Service was quick, ordering on iPad brought food to us in no time and the meal was generous and very tasty! Vegan teen appeased :
4
We went for lunch on valentine's day with a group of friends. It's just opposite I12 mall. The food was good, more than I expected but was bit pricy.Food presentation was very nice and the service was good. It took a while for the food to come, so it's better to order the starters and main dish in one go. I never expected that they won't serve soups as we really wanted to have some hot soup. May be they should include that in future
4
I ordered the mutton bryani item, while my wide ordered garlic naan with mutton curry. Both items were delicious, although my wife commented we expect more garlic in the naan. These items plus one-for-one Tiger beer added up to $60. The staff were helpful. Ordering of food is via a tablet device
5
I was really impressed and I've had Indian in many places. Great Food in a cool neighborhood and unassuming environment. Try it!
3
Decent indian food. Great decor and family friendly. Comes complete with a play corner to keep the kids busy.
3
Service was not good. they should provide set dinner also instead of just set lunch butter chicken not so good, and expensive, $17!!!!!! Crazy ice cream was good but I think eating at Prata wala better
3
Didn't start well with the waitress telling us the "ipad" made a mistake and we had to squeeze onto a table for 6 with 10 pax. This quickly or more like a slow coach to screaming hungry children hell with regards to getting the food. BTW you will get lulled into a false sense of security that the service will be efficient with the ipad being your means of ordering. So trying to be fair we patiently waited for the food. Ok at best mediocre. Lacking in fragrant spices. Very watered down version of the original. Then no topping up of water...but then again the supposedly normal spicy orders were not spicy. Maybe that was the reason. So go if you really need some form of Indian. Otherwise give it a skip. Much better fare elsewhere in the east.
1
The food was pretty ordinary for the amount you need to shell out and for the horrible service you need to put up with!We were in a medium sized group with 3 kids. The kids play area has visibly shrunk since the last time we were there and it is not well kept! Visibly dirty and broken toys. Despite the fact that there were barely a few other tables occupied, the service was very very slow and the waiting lady was very unaccomodative. We sat there for almost 1 hour and the kids started getting hungry. I requested the waiting lady to take her time with the rest of the food but pass on a few breads so the kids could get started. She blatantly refused stating that they follow a queue and cannot break that. She did not offer to provide anything else that the kids may be able to eat and plainly walked off. Extremely disappointed with the service. Definitely not going back. Certainly not recommending this place to any of my friends and family
4
Visited the Zaffron Kitchen recently and the Restaurant has this modern yet Rustic look.The Menu is presented on an IPad and you can choose and place the order with spiciness or other special requests put in.Food was good. The taste and texture of the food was fantastic. Kebabs are great.Tandoori Breads blew us away. One of the good ones we had in recent times.The prices could be a little more competitive consider it's location.I wouldnt mind the current costing for a Bayfront / CBD setting
2
Pros - play area - although very tiny but still it is a plus and kept the kids busy for some timeAnd that's about it. Everything else was disappointingService - extremely slow in spite of asking them a couple of times. We waited for about 30 mins for our order when only 4 tables were occupied in the restaurant. We don't eat mushroom so we asked for it to be replaced by paneer tikki or seekh kebab on the platter and we're told they can only replace with the cheaper dish (difference was 1$ in price and we offered to pay the difference, but answer was no). We asked if one bread can be served first, as we had hungry kids waiting, and we were told no. Water was served in the end after asking for it twice.Food- average at best. Paneer tikki was a little burnt. Gobhi kebab was bland and hence was left. Mains were just ok. Breads were good.After mains experience, we decided to skip desserts.Prices are of a decent restaurant, so we expected decent experience. But wouldn't go back.
3
Service was average and food came out really slow that night. My family had to wait for almost 40mins upon ordering. Lack of staff as well as a busy dinner crowd could be the reason. The saving grace was that food was good and our perennial favorites which were the naans and the butter chicken were excellent.
2
I have to agree the food is great, but it must be the most expensive Indian in the East Coast. plus you have to order yourself on an ipad, then pay for service as well, it should be one or other, not both!The large kids play area has been shrunk, the playhouse has gone, so not as kid friendly as it used to be.Waiting times are Long, service is disinterested.We won't be back.
4
This is the 3rd time I have visited this restaurant and it continues to be pretty good in terms of food and ambience. The staff are very friendly and patient. Just some suggestions:1. Some of the chairs were slightly off balance (shorter leg etc)2. I asked for a table for 5 and was given a round table which made it rather cramped. The round table is ideally meant for 3 people not 5. Suggest not to push people into taking smaller tables to increase the number of people in the restaurant. Comfort is important
4
Good food with nice staff, service a bit slow but it is a good experience. Will go back for sure. Recommended tikka chicken and vegetables curry.
1
A bad experience with Indian food in Singapore . Except the ambience of the place, nothing was much enticing. The quality is service provided and the taste of food were bad. Not a place to recommend to others.
3
Food was fantastic as always... But service could have been more better.. which disappointed me taking my wife for my anniversary lunch..
4
Authentic Indian food. Good value for money. Great place for families with kids! Play area available for kids.
5
We had dinner and really enjoyed it. We ordered 2 dum chicken biryani which were large and enough for 3-4 persons to share. We also ordered the butter chicken and garlic naan. All the dishes were very tasty and the meat very tender.The service was excellent and the staff friendly and efficient.We especially appreciate the ambience which felt cosy and comfy - like being at home. Will definitely come back.We made the reservation online which was painless with an immediate confirmation
1
We had been to this place on Friday for dinner. Family of 4 (kids age 8 and 13). We has ordered 2 veg dishes, biryani, bread and 2 starters (chiken tikka and papri chat). The total was about 95$. The money is just one part however the food was absolutely not upto mark. The veg kolhapuri was simple bland tomato gravey. The briyani was horrible with panner gravy mixed in pulao and tasted not even close to biryani. overall very very disappointed
4
I dined at Zaffron twice in a month because my partner is unable to get the Briyani out of his mind. Chicken briyani was so good, chicken melts in the mouth, rice just the right texture. Tikka chicken was my next fav, it was soft and very flavorful. We also had the butter naan with buttery chicken curry. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves very much. Price wise, I find them a tad pricey. Naan costs $4.50 upwards. A meal for two always cost min $70 for us. Mango lassi was $7.50, also pricey in my terms. Service interestingly was mixed bag of emotions for us. The first time we were there, it was packed and service was bad. Orders taking and service of the staff was below expectations. The second time however, when the restaurant was less than half filled, the service became personable and friendly. A true great restaurant should strive to maintain service levels at all times :
4
I dined with 3 friends (two of them vegetarian) at the Zaffron Kitchen restaurant in the suburb of Katong in Singapore as it was close to our hotel the Grand Mercure Singapore Roxy. The food was generally very tasty but drinks especially beer and wine were very expensive at about $12 or $14. This is probably par for the course in Singapore but in Australia we generally pay about $7 for a beer or wine. The mango lassi was very nice and only about $6.50. This restaurant gives you a tablet so you can choose your own dishes electronically. I don't really think this works very well as there is only one tablet per table and so each person needs to hand the tablet around for everyone to see the menu. Perhaps a better process would be to provide everyone with the normal hard copy menus and then the person serving you just adds the items to the tablet. It was not a big issue but some people may not like it, especially old folk not used to technology like tablets
4
Bit pricey but thats what you will pay for a boutique like Indian restaurant. Food is good and the small kids area is actually a stroke of genuis. Though small it's enough to keep them busy while you gulp your meal.....ensuring you savour the taste more! :
4
I've always been surprised by the lack of good Indian restaurants in Singapore, considering the high percentage of Indians here. Zaffron is an exception. The first thing you notice is the modern interiors of the place - very atypical for an Indian restaurant in Singapore! The food is also good. We were there on a weekday and opted in for their set lunch and 1 for 1 beer option. Pretty satisfied with the overall experience and I can confidently recommend Zaffron for anyone looking for a good Indian restaurant in Singapore
4
Using the tablet to place the order allowed us to eat at our pace rather than having all our food coming at once.
Food tasted great, atmosphere was pleasant.
4
Staff were very welcoming and very friendly. The food is really good and extremely delicious! Try their chicken tikka, can never go wrong with that choice.
4
Wanted a good local Indian curry. Popular place & food fantastic. Try the mutton masala & the chicken tikka perfect. Generally good all round will be back.
5
One of the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. The authentic punjabi food. Flavours are better than some of the restaurants in Delhi. Always love to take friends and family to this place.
4
Not our first time at Zaffron, definitely not our last. They've always manage to deliver great food at affordable prices. Service was fairly on-point. Unfortunately as there was a queue at the door we felt rather rushed for the seat. Try to come during weekdays instead.
4
I had heard good reviews about this restaurant but based on my experience in other Indian restaurants in the city, my expectations were pretty average. However I was pleasantly surprised. In fact, I was very happy, and so were the friends that I had invited. The service was swift and the food delicious. Not too spicy, in fact so delicious was the food that chilli was not needed at all. Their menu accommodates all kinds of spice range and of course you can request your preference.The environment was casual and comfortable, the ambience was not bad. Overall a great experience and I will definitely go back for more
4
Eaten here before - meal very tasty, reasonably priced - good play area for our grandson to be kept occupied. The one downside is the woeful service. Our family of five was alone in the restaurant, yet we had to continually try to attract their attention to get any sort of service - heaven knows what it would be like at busy times 
4
Very yummy Indian food and moderate prices. Untouristy. They have a fun "playhouse" for kids, although I did not understand why the TV had to be turned on with kids DVD's as well. Friendly service. Liked the butter chicken a lot. Great nan bread with raisins
3
The restaurant was packed ! Testimony to the tasty food they serve !I've been there a couple of times to enjoy their tasty Punjabi food.I suspect that the foundation of their tasty food is probably a healthy over dose of MSG. During one of my meals there I suffered an overwhelming thirst. My requests for water fell on the ears of their indifferent service staff who routinely ignored me. After 3 failed attempts to get water, I resorted to self service, I helped myself to water from their service counter. Back home I continued to drink copious amounts of water to counter this thirsty sensation. I suppose their restaurant patrons are willing to accept bad service for the sake of tasty food. BTW If you are technologically challenged, ordering food can be challenge as you have to handle an Ipad to order food
4
Visit to this restaurant delete one evening.I was a little put out at having to order from an iPad, but with a little assistance from the staff it was manageable. Maybe I'm a little old for ordering from iPads. Technology is not my forte.The food was excellent as was the naan bread. There was a good choice of food on the menu - nice selection.The price was quite reasonable and I had a very good meal in pleasant surroundings.Would return in any time. I'm accustomed to the iPad as well now!! Great service keep it up
3
In a very good location. Nice environment, Good selection of North Indian cuisine. Service was appalling. I wouldn't blame the staff for they really need training. Overall experience was good.
5
I just love this restaurant. Always gives the best quality service and food everytime. Highly recommended
4
Nice Indian food. We had the butter chicken, Mattar Paneer, Aloo Ghobi and Naan. All were good. There is a playhouse for children and looked like they had a kid's menu, too. This makes it a popular place for families with young children.
4
Food was very good and the portions were just nice to cater to our hunger & taste buds. Quick and prompt service
Highly recommend this to anyone who is around east coast and want to try Indian food.

Whilst catching up with friends along with my wife....Pros: food good.good beer promoCon: tad pricey.We asked to change seats because my wife was cold underneath vent. Guy just turn vent ither way. Think their ordering system cant handle us changing tables....but then saw another indian famil able to change their seating.Ordering system though seems efficient i feel it is very impersonal via tablets. E.g. i asked for a beer from head waiter. Instead of getting the beer straightaway ( restaurant only had 3 active tables including us), he saidwe key in the tablet menu first. Impersonal.I entered the doorway citibg my reservation. Guy simple stepped to one side without showing me table.I booked restaurant twice via online. Chope replied it was booked. Restaurants own system did not reply so i called them first they said no such name then they checked again to say confirmed. Did not thank me nor say looking forward to seeing you. Impersonal.System makes people over relianr on machines and not relationships. If not fixed complacency will set in
3
The food - we ordered a few chats and tandoori chicken as starters and roghan josh and palak paneer as main dish with kulchas and garlic naans - was good and authentic but various restrictions like no orders of set lunch after 230 and no extra onion unless you order another dish soured our experience 
4
The guys at Zaffron Kitchen have clearly thought through how they wanted to present themselves. An open plan kitchen area, space for kids and nice decor gets you in the door and then being presented with a swish customised iPad to make your meal choices is quite a cool experience.Food wise it's good. The starters are probably what we typically enjoy the most and are unusual and super tasty. Curries are good - very good compared to hawker/food court fare - but not the very best we have had in SG so far. Still, it's good. Definitely.If we want a quick bite/blast of Indian food this is usually the place we go, the turnaround is as fast (or slow) as you want it. If you want to take your time and have a longer and slightly more satisfying meal there are places nearby that are a bit better.But really this is very good, and it's awesome to have different Indian restaurant options nearby on East Coast Road to suit your mood :

It's always unfortunate when good food is marred by, quite frankly, awful service. I visited the outlet during a weekday lunch, being a small venue I expected it to be busy. However, upon arriving, we were asked to wait when there were tables available inside the restaurant. Typically, I wouldn't have been too bothered by this, except that we waited for a good 10 minutes before we were sat down. Ordering, via iPads, was simple and straightforward and all the orders came correctly. But, alas, we waited for about a 35 minutes for our food to arrive, which in a busy restaurant at full capacity isn't too bad. However tables around us, that had arrived much later than us, all received their food before us.That being said, the food was still delicious and arrived warm to the table. The weekday lunch sets were good and they offer a wide range of dishes, suitable for vegetarians as well. The ambiance of the restaurant was my favourite aspect. Designed like an old timey vintage spot, even the outer facade of the restaurant upheld the style of a older more classic venue. The ambiance was great, however I would reconsider going again during a weekday lunch
1
Butter chicken - chicken not fresh and too hard, gravy didn't have the creamy buttery taste it should have. It was more of a butterless old chicken.Garlic Naan - garlic unevenly spread on the naan, it was like the chef just tossed a spoonful log chopped garlic for the sake of it.. All the garlic just on one spot, garlic not freshPaneer Tikka - the paneer seemed to be cooked well from outside, but after a bite, could still feel the cubes of paneer was cold on the inside. It was as though the paneer was just taken out from the freezer, dipped in the sauce and placed in the tandoor.Malai Kofta - could be betterLassi - I'm glad their lassi was good. Could definitely tell that the passion fruit lassi was made using artificial flavours. The lassi and the service staff is the only reason I would think of coming back here, not for the food though, unless they made some drastic improvement

Stopped by with a friend from India for a business lunch. Definitely the food was good. The service was a little slow and a bit confused, but it was worth the extra wait. I would eat here again happily, but I would not go out of my way to find the place

Great placebos good North Indian food. Clean and great waiter staff. Only issue if you don't have a booking or come in during peak hour you have to wait in line. Great butter chicken vindaloo and their briyani was awesome. Great pricing point for everyone.
4
Probably the best Indian food in East Coast. Must try chicken tikka, butter chicken, rogan Josh, tandoori jinga
4
Absolutely love this place. Food is great, small play area for the kids, good service. They use technology very well. All orders placed on the iPad. The location of the restaurant is great too.

Very Good restaurant offering Indian Subcontinental food. Dishes were well prepared and very tasty. Service was good. Try the Indian Wines from Northern India, they were indeed very pleasant
5
Probably the best butter chicken in town. Other food on the menu are very tasty too.Highly recommended to book earlier especially during weekend or public holiday as it is always full house and the wait can be a while.For those with small children, they have a small indoor playground for the kids therefore you may enjoy your food to the fullest while the children busy making new friends.Suitable for family dinner and friend

I greatly enjoyed my dinner here, which consisted of butter chicken, garlic naan and lamb shank briyani (this was a promotion for the month). The portion of lamb given was huge in comparison to restaurants and it was also around the same price in other upmarket Western restaurants at $22. I was pleasantly surprised. The hollow of the bone was also full of marrow, which was a bonus. The quality ingredients, portions and the taste - full of flavour and spices reminiscent of the dishes I had in North India itself - makes this places a winner for me.

OK, so it helps if you're a bit tech-savvy to order your meal by iPad, but there are organic waiters to help if needed.The range of dishes here is quite broad, and I've never had a bad one. My only gripe is that some things go unavailable quite early in the evening, sometimes basic stuff like rice dishes. Other than that try the specials of the day, they are usually good value and you can see stuff being prepared. Nice relaxed atmosphere, and one of my favourites on East Coast Road
5
Although crowded and busy they found us a place to sit. We were not expecting much but we were very hungry and chose this place just becasue we were tired of looking. We were really surprised; we all thought the food tasted wonderful. We ate until it hurt. Great service and good valu

Disappointed with the visit. Food quality was quite poor and service was slow. the ambience is decent but it doesnt make up for the lack of food quality. We ordered the salad and parathas, we have had better at other places. No intention of visiting again
4
we are vegeterians so Pls note the review is on veggie items. We ordered tandoori mushroom, pulao and wrap, strawberry lassi. Every item was tasting good and medium spiced.. They have a kids play area which my daughter enjoyed thoroughly. It's a good restaurant I would recommend. P.S. I could see people who ordered non-veg food were enjoying their food they could improve on their customer servic

Very poor service. The manager said it takes 45 mins to deliver the order with.. in 46 mins we just received Papadum n on when asked the manager tool pride n showed attitude in claiming that min time 45 mins..
4
Had dinner here and was surprise that the food was really good. Ordered the garlic naan with the butter chicken and seafood curry (cannot remember the name). The garlic naan goes well with the curry and they also have a naan that is sweet.
4
Dropped in for lunch and was pleasantly surpirses.... The food is very good though portion sizes are small for the price charged.... Definitely a go for authentic indian food lovers...
5
Not much from the road . But.Step inside and you are into some of the best indian food you will get anywhere!Excellent speedy service with a smile and constant (though not the least intrusive) attention throughout the meal.Excellent play area for children including a bid 'Wendy house' and a rocking horse and numerous other solidly made toys. Some of the best toilet and washing facilities I have seen for a long time.Once finished the bill is efficiently delivered with none of the normal waiting around.If you have babies or young children they have 2/3 different sized high chairs
4
The food here is very good, and easily recognisable to us dumb westerners. The meats are well prepared and cooked, and the vegetable dished full of flavour and texture. Staff are friendly and helpful, and will even help us out with those damned iPads.Love this place

This Indian restaurant is conveniently located at a major intersection opposite the i12 Katong Mall, so you can't miss it if you're on East Coast Road. From the moment you step through the doors of the restaurant, you know you're in for a treat as the robust aromas of Indian spices waft through the air.My partner and I have dined here quite often, and have literally explored the entire menu. There's indeed very few items we would not recommend as almost everything is very well done here. Perhaps not as authentic as some die-hard Indian food fans may expect, but every dish is flavorful and very well seasoned.Absolute must-haves when we are here - the butter chicken, palak paneer and the mixed tandoori platter, which gives you a selection of tandoor-grilled fish, chicken and lamb. Pair these with either their tasty Naan bread or rice and you have a pretty delicious, satisfying meal

This is a great indian. Take note you self order on the supplied i pad. I didn't know and on my first visit sat like a lemon before being shown what to do.The food is fantastic, really authentic the service is fast and efficient, The butter chicken was a delight. The kitchen is visible to all and its amazing what they can churn out given the space and lack of fuss.The rice was also a delight, cooked so well and such delicate flavours. The surroundings are not traditional but pleasant enough the prices were the top of mid range. But the food is delicious. Highly recommended
1
this is the worst buffet we ever had. it is stated International, it's look more like expensive local mixed rice. Variety is extremely limited and the only available free flow drink is cold plain water. They don't even have chocolate favour ice-cream. Just don't waste money on this restaurant. My near-by coffee shop mixed rice stall can cook better then them

This is a clean little reastaurant at Westgate with a capacity of about 50 persons inside the restaurant and 8 persons outside if you prefer the non-air conditoned open area. The restaurant serves alcohol too and has 7 bar stools.I went there with my wife at about 8:15pm on a weekday and it was almost full. All tables have plates and a little porcelain bucket with serviettes and cultery. For starters we had papadam. It came with 2 dips: mango chutney and mint. Delicious.We then had vegetable briyani accompanied with yogurt, tomato curry and papadam. The vegetable briyani was not oily and it came with peas, carrots, corn, cauliflower, broccoli, tomatoes and green chilli. (You can specify how hot you want by the way.) Actually, the amount was enough for two.It was a nice meal. Service was fast. You make your choice from an iPad. It is a restaurant worth visiting. What would make this a great restaurant is if the waiters were able to explain the composition iof the dishes. They seemed a bit hurried. One also appreciates a knowledable waiter
4
For once, I am came out of an indian restaurant a satisfied diner. No doubt there are hints of modern elements being infused with the dishes, but as a whole, the dishes served were very authentic. Furthermore, to have tukey taste tender and juciy requires skill as well as experience, and that was what Zaffron did right. Really worth a visit and they serve great beverages as well.For full pictures and review read my post @ http://shauneeie.blogspot.sg/2014/12/zaffron-kitchen-contemporary-indian.htm

We went there on a Saturday for lunch. We are 4 and the restaurant was not crowded. Service was good and food tasty. There is a kids corner.
4
The food we ordered was so delicious. My daughter loved the food there. The seating was comfortable. We found that their lunches were reasonably priced. Dinner was a bit expensive though it's yummy.
4
Good food but totally disinterested staff one ay sit for thirty minutes and being willfully ignored. if one is prepared to do so the food is good.
5
There's food and there's authentic food. Tonite, I sampled REAL Indian cuisine, not modified for local tastes - jus like what I sampled on my trips to Bombay, Mysore and New Delhi - hence the overwhelming patronage of expat Indians! No wonder... just discovered from their website that Zaffron Kitchen won the 2013 Best Indian Casual Restaurant and 2014 Best Asian Restaurant!! I'll be back
2
Visited this restaurant 2nd time in last 6 months. Food quality not bad given the price. Suspect food is precooked and heated using a micro. Both times food was ready to be served but remained at the hatch for over 10 minutes. Today's waiter was a racist - wanted to serve Caucasians 1st despite them arriving later. He had a very bad b/o. It was 12.30 - just getting busy for lunch and had already run out of diet colas. Also considering it was lunch time, they only had 1 waiter
5
We chose this place because it was spacious and clean and it did not disappoint. We were attended to quickly by a staff member who handed over IPad's that doubled as menus and ordering devices. I guess whilst glancing over the menu it meant that you could order then and there without trying to remember what it was you wanted. It was an interesting concept which worked well with the food and drinks delivered promptly. The meals were well priced and tasty and I would visit here again. If you're after Indian in this area then this is the place to go. The chefs and kitchen are on show here too which I like, means they have nothing to hide
2
Staff attitude it is why are u here!!!even though, there were not many customers during our visit, food took quite sometime to arrive, staff just left the tablet on the table and left without a word. There many better places with great food at better price than this restaurant.
2
Had dinner at the East Coast Road restaurant yesterday. Really disappointing, will not return. Looks really nice from the outside, no Indian feel to the restaurant once inside. Food were ok although our stomachs have not been settled all night. Service not very good, staff all miserable

I recently visited their Westgate (Jurong) outlet on a Friday evening. The place was packed with people and the orders took long to arrive. The outlet is perhaps just enough for 20 - 25 pax, and does away with the fine dining stuff once the number is exceeded. I was quite impressed by their style of ordering thru IPad on every tableThe food was good specially for the starters - Sheekh Kebab, Tandoori Chicken, assorted pakodas etc. to name a few. The main course was just nice with the Butter chicken tasting a bit bland On the whole - A joint in the west worth trying but needs more space to accommodate the patrons

Zaffron Kitchen, Westgate is now my family's favorite Indian restaurant. After a long time there is a restaurant with authentic Indian taste. The restaurant has selected dishes and everything we tried tasted really good. In our last 4 visits we have tried Dal makhani, dal tadka, tandoori platter (vegetarian and non-vegetarian), tandoori jhinga (tiger prawns), masala okra, jaipuri vegetable, palak paneer, jira rice, butter naan, garlic naan, aloo kulcha and dhania paratha. The quality of food was great everytime. I'd recommend both the dals, masala okra, tandoori jhinga for prawn lovers and if you want to have wheat bread then go for dhania paratha. Everytime we came out satisfied with the meal and complemented the chef. I'd say the price is slightly on the higher side. We spent about $30 per person but felt that the food was well worth the money.The restaurant has good hygiene. It's well maintained and ambience is good. The staff if very friendly and service is good. Once I went there with my mom and we were waiting to get in. The restaurant manager quickly arranged a table so she doesn't have to stand outside for long.So, if you are craving good Indian food try Zaffron Kitchen and you won't be disappointed
3
Food was nice. Service erratic. Second round of naan took 20 minutes & dirty plates sat for half an hour. Great for kids with small play area.
4
The ambience of the restaurant is nice. Food is as good. However, the number of crowd is huge and therefore it is kinda stressing out the waiter/waitress. But manager is very attentive.
Will definitely come back again.
2
Service was bad and slow. Staff weren't courteous and even for basic things like water we had to ask multiple times. Only when it came to the bill they were very prompt.
The food presentation was better than the taste.
5
Excellent service ..... Very good food which has made our dining experience great. We could not stop ordering as every dish was just simply very good. Satisfying as the portions were enough for us.Good value for money. We enjoyed the experience and definitely will be coming back.Keep smiling
5
Saffron kitchen does serve fantastic Indian food - we visited with a group of 20 people. The food was served quickly but fresh, the taste was fantastic and size of the portions is perfect as well. Service was good as well. I will definitely be back
3
This place has really good food. Quantity is very less for the price. And service is terrible. But the main course food and starters is the one of the best I have had in Singapore. Would recommend if you are ok with bad service but great food
1
If the saying 'never judge a book by its cover' is true for any place, it has to be for this restaurant. Service is plainly put, extremely poor. I had to ask for water 4 times before it was served . It seems no one cared for customers.Food is plain awful. We ordered a mix meat platter and gosh! Such bad flavor. Kebabs were smelly and you could make out it wasn't fresh. The ' dal tadka' had no salt in it. After the dinner, we were left extremely dissatisfied and underwhelmed. Do yourself a favor, don't visit this place if you crave for good North Indian food!
4
I usually don't recommend restaurants but I came across Zaffron while staying locally and ended up going there 3 times. The food here has fantastic flavour and is of high quality. I'll definitely be going back again if I'm in the area (Try the butter chicken
5
It was one of the best Indian restaurants in my life, it has also introduced me to the world of Indian spice and variety of Indian curry. It is definitely a must-go place for curry lovers!! Environment is chic and staff is very friendly. Very pleasant for family hang out, especially with young kids
3
Moans first, no menus, just one tablet between 7 of us, took an age to find out what was on the menu, make or minds up, change them, as you do, especially the kids, doing it all through the person who got to grips with the navigation, was a pain in the posterior. Food came, then the kids deserts, but the table wasn't cleared, the plates just moved to accommodate the deserts, 15 mins later still not cleared, decided to pay the bill only to find there was a10% service charge! For what I asked? We hadn't had any.Moans over, the food was great all of it, and good value for money. Just a shame about the menus and service. Go again? Probably not
4
The title pretty much sums up my views of this place. I have been here once for a Diwali dinner with friends and found the dining experience quite pleasant. The food is very good, the portion sizes quite generous and the ambience cozy.
4
We mostly love coming here!
The food is fantastic especially the masala dosai. Unfortunately the service is still a little hit n miss here although we know they are trying hard. Will definitely be back!

After a morning's outing at the Chinese Garden, we got onto the EW Line and decided to get off at the next station , Jurong East, to visit the new West Gate Mall. Walked past Zaffron Kitchen and decided to have our lunch there. We ordered the butter chicken set and tandoori chicken set and both turned out to be delicious. Great value for money too at $12 per set which includes a hot or cold beverage . The service was friendly and the interior decor cosy. It also has a well-stocked bar. We would certainly visit Zaffron again the next time we shop at Jem and Westgate.

1st visit with family to this place. earlier visit was just 2 of us. conveniently located and competes head on with lot of restaurants nearby. was pleasantly surprised on the use of i-pads for taking down orders. Quite heavy to hold them (maybe they should use i-pad air :) ) . Staff truly spent lot of time in serving, taking additional orders and getting the table ready for next guests. innovative idea to have a children play corner. If there is one thing the restaurant that needs to work upon is space. Compared to other restaurants, this place is definately crampy. the table size and space between 2 tables is shocking. its not that guests fall over each other to eat but its definately clear that they have got it wrong on seating arrangements. maybe they should look at compromising the play corner - not sure if they have seen guests kids fully utilizing it. it was also very clear that the guys have innovative ideas and put to use all of them in a place that is about 2000+ sq ft if i am correct (kitchen including). practicality has been ignored...my 2nd visit implicitly states that the food is very good and will be a returning guest but next time not as a group / large family

Zaffron Kitchen is located on the main East Coast Road , SINGAPORE . It serves Authentic North Indian Vegetarian & Non Vegetarian Cuisine . Menu covers wide range of Indian Dishes which are delicious &served fast .  The Restaurant has good ambience & also has a small but well planned children play corner .Selection of Menu by customers is digitally done which saves lots of time in browsing the Menu & placing orders . The staff is courteous & polite. The Restaurant has Valet Parking which is a nice facility since it is located right on the main road

It was a while since I last went to Zaffron Kitchen. I fancied Indian food and remembered the great food I enjoyed there. The restaurant was busy, but that's a good sign, and we had no problems being seated promptly. The staff were friendly and most attentive. The ambience was great and it really is great value for money. I noticed that they started serving tea sets too. I will definitely be back with my girlfriends to try. Highly recommend this place

Went here with friends late evening. Whilst there were tables outside, we went inside, but the air conditioning was especially fierce. Menus are delivered via an Ipad. The app was straightforward, but we missed the advice and recommendations that you get from a knowledgeable waiter. Food arrived promptly, including the jug of Tiger beer. The food was fine, but not special. However, we were surprised to be told that the kitchen was closing and felt under pressure to vacate the restaurant, when we were not really ready to go. An Ok experience, but other Indian restaurants in Singapore provide a much better experience with similar value for money

I had a sudden craving for Indian food one Saturday, and that was when I decided to check out Zaffron Kitchen. Of course it was crowded, being a weekend. Besides, on the numerous occasions walking pass the restaurant, I noticed huge throngs of diners inside. That all the more led me to wonder if it was really worth the money.I made a reservation through their website on the same day I was dining, which I realized, did not help me get a table. My reservation apparently did not show up on the computer screen. So much for technology! Luckily, there was a table for two available inside. There were tables outside the restaurant as well, for those wanting a breath of fresh air instead. Besides, the tables inside were placed too close to one another, in my opinion. Perhaps, this was a conscious decision to squeeze as many tables as one can into a tiny space. For families, a welcome relief is a corner for kids. A huge playhouse dominates this corner of the restaurant and keeps kids busy whilst their parents wined and dined. Orders were placed with the iPad. I love the way Zaffron Kitchen embraces technology. It does cut down on labour as there is no need for order-takers. The patrons pick, select and submit their food and beverage choices.The food was nicely cooked but took awhile to reach our table, in part because of the crowd. The service staff too took some time to react to requests, but nonetheless were friendly enough. I do wish water was served immediately without having the need to ask though.Overall, good job with the food but I would choose a weekday to dine instead the next time.

The first time we have been ever asked to finish up & leave because they wanted to give the table to someone else. When we were seated we were never told that we need to wrap up within a certain time. The moment the last morsel was eaten, we got a 'Times up' comment from the waitress. Embarrassing and very insulting. Never coming back to this place

13 October 2013 - We had dinner at 9pm, mutton masala and butter naan was room temperature at best, when we were really looking forward to some hot food.Half Tandoori Chicken though well marinated, was 4 pieces of scrawny looking chicken.Water mug was not refilled despite being empty for 20 minutes.Not the best place to use our $42
