Copper chimney is veg and non veg both type restaurant they good quality and rates in Singapore and co operative staff for food prepare as north indain style.
4
This is a place bang opposite to the Mustafa Center ,,, After a day full of shopping and tiredness , this place will give you some lip smacking food .. try their non veg variations .. I is lovely ...
4
Nice indian food, choley bhature was very tasteful.
Service was good, price quality is also good. I recommend this restaurant
3
While the food is good and the manager seems to be an intelligent fellow, the other employees at the restaurant could be least bothered about service. I was very disappointed given that i have eaten at copper chimney in India and expected at least the same level of service
4
We had all sorts of food ordered - chicken tandoori, chili chicken, soups, manchurian, noodles, stir fried rice and naans. Let me not forget the dessert. Althought food was good, it took a long time to deliver. I guess there we alot of orders for them that day.
4
Friendly service and good ambience. The butter chicken was excellent. The restaurant appeared to have plenty of local patrons. Had a good selection of Northern Indian food.
3
I thought the food here was very average. I have had better Indian food elsewhere. However, the great place about her sis that it is very clean and tidy. It is nicely air conditioned and staff were polite
4
Not a big place. But serves decent, tasty food on time. My friends love their Briyani and Mutton delicacies. I generally try mix of Indian and ChinoIndian dishes and happy with their spicy noodles
4
A very nice restaurant providing Indian non-veg food in a prominent location in Little India, which is an important part of Singapore
1
Visited the restaurant on 17th Dec for Lunch and the food was pathetic...to our surprise the service staff was very arrogant and undiscipilned..specially the server by the name Vijay wanted us to place our entire order in one go as they were very busy preparing food for Take Away orders...this was when the restaurant was empty with only a couple of guests..NOT RECOMMENDED TO ANY TRAVELLERS!!! PATHETIC SERVICES!!
4
One of the few North Indian veg + non veg food places in Little India. It is next to Mustafa. Must Eats: Chaat and Naan set
3
The staff were helpful with the menu and with assisting us to choose comfortable seating. Starters of spring roll and salt and pepper prawns were lovely.For mains, I chose black pepper chicken and while I recognise that this might not have been to my taste, the gravy was lukewarm and starting to congeal as it was served. The taste was not peppery and the chicken was grey and unappetising. Hubby chose the chicken tikka masala and that was nice so, of course, he had to share with me. The pashwari nans were small and round but very tasty. Some drinks were not available. The iced tea was standard bottled stuff. Would have preferred something fresh.Quite acceptable but there are plenty of places to choose from at this level. The Copper Chimney could lift their game
5
Serves very good North Indian food. Nice location. Just Opposite Mustafa Center. Service is very fast
4
The fish curry was mind blowing. The chaas refreshing and the chicken curry not so bad. The service was good too and a busy place even on a weekday!
5
This is one of the few Indian restaurants where you can find authentic Indian taste. The place is great value for money and is a must try in Singapore
3
Went to this place only because my folks were craving Indian Chinese food. The location is convenient, right outside Mustafa. We were shopping at Mustafa and hungry once done. So, this seemed like the obvious choice. The food is decent but it surely fails to capture the true essence of Tangra Chinese (Indian Chinese). The covering of the momos was below par and the schezwan wasn't spicy. Anyday, Fifth Season is better than this. I haven't tried the North Indian food here though
4
Nice restaurant just opposite Mustafa centre in Little India in Singapore... must visit for its famous dal makhini.. butter garlic naan and North Indian food ...nice interior and service was also ok... reasonably priced you will enjoy all indian food here ..
4
Lovely tasty food and friendly service also they keep the place very clean , the neighbourhood with Mustafa centre exactly opposite is rather messy and the open dirt containers along the street are annoying
4
Was there with a girl friend. We randomly walked into Copper Chimney. Ordered tandoori chicken, paneer tikka masala, garlic naan, lassi for my friend and masala tea for myself. Food was good, love the paneer especially. Patron on the next table was very generous to allow us to savior some vegetable dish and thatâ€™s a delicious dish, not sure what it is called. Food served within short span of time and service was good. Will come back to try that particular vegetable dish. It is a little pricey though.
5
We really enjoyed our meal here and the service was great. Mustafa is like India town and is a bit of a assault on western senses if you aren't used to that sort of thing so copper chimney is a bit of respite. We only tried this one restaurant in mustafa to be honest but I would recommend it to friends going to the Mustafa centre which is over the street
4
On business trips with Indian colleagues. Based in Little India. Looking for easy evening meal. Copper Chimney was fully authentic, good quality and better value.
3
So ordinary now it hurts. I've been coming here for more than 7 years and never once been disappointed. Was last here about a year ago. Came in so excited, ordered all my favourite dishes. The food was really average and didn't taste at all like it used to. 4 dishes and not one came out well. Something's changed, the management, the chef, the recipe. Whatever it is, I'm not coming back.
4
I was craving for good desi food , at my search ended me up with copper chimney . Located opposite to Mustafa centre. Serving multiple cuisines like North Indian, Chinese , Mughlai and local too in veg and nonveg . A vegan must try : veritable biryan
5
Happened upon this establishment during a night visit to Mustafa Mall and was attracted by the large number of locals eating there... the staff were great and very helpful with the menu/food selection. The food arrived quickly and was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.... the vindaloo was a little hotter than I was expecting ( I should have known better ) but was still delicious.Recommend a visit if you are in the little india vicinity of Singapore....
4
I loved this place. I walked in randomly having not read a review but wasn't disappointed. The food was nice, if not overly cheap, and the service was good. I had the vegetarian momo's and the spicy black pepper chicken. I really enjoyed both meals. I'd definitely go again
5
This restaurant is located opposite Mustafa, along with many other Indian eating places and mobile shops. At 8pm on a Saturday night, we could not find a place that wasn’t packed with diners. Copper Chimney staff assured us that the place was air conditioned and accepts VISA , so we were sold.CC is well staffed and service is prompt and friendly without being overly intrusive. We had vegetarian biryani, palak paneer with the chunky, soft and milky paneer, chicken tikka that still bears the taste of charcoal embers and a lamb kebab that was moist, tender and not heavily spiced. Accompanying yogurt for the various meats has a nice zing with no strong onion overtones. Rice tasted gently complex with fried onions, cardamons and herbs. It was one of the most enjoyable Indian meal I had for a while.CC provides free flow of water but does not supply papadam snacks like most places. The 2 toilets for patrons were clean and well maintained. There is free wifi for patrons with good connectivity.Pricing is in the mid to high range but almost all single items do not cost more than $15.Definitely worth going back again to check out the rest of the menu
4
Had dinner with family here , the food is quite good ( specially Butter naans) but the portion size is quite small & seem not worth the price you pay .Prices are similar to the restaurants in Clarke Quay .If you are not worried about the price tag , you can enjoy your North Indian food here 
4
Reasonable prices (by Singapore standards), good indian food + quick and friendly service. 2 mains + veg side dish + 3 cokes + coffee + indian tea cost us 67$ all inclusiv
2
We went to this place as it is right opposite Mustafa Centre but came back disappointed. The food was not at all great & the service is also delayed
4
We really enjoyed our curries and tandoori chicken. The naan bread was good too all for about £30 including soft drinks and a rice
5
We have been coming here regularly for the butter chicken and naan. Each time, the staff are very hospitable and service is quick. The food quality is consistently great. Highly recommend!
3
I came back to Copper Chimney, with my family, recalling with nice expectations a great lunch we had a year before. The experience was disappointing. The food was average with overly dry kebab and not particularly tasty tandoori. But more puzzling was the stern face of all waiters but one. No sense of welcome, no smile, very robotic service. Maybe it was a bad day for them, but such overall attitude was a turnoff and not in line with our earlier good memories.
1
I visited the place with family food not good and overpriced. .servings MINI SERVINGS very small ...overpriced place I advise people dnt visit...as I read I see owner retaliates other patrons that ate at his place..he wants correct them.He seems very authoritive..bossy to clients also..I will not visit that place neither recommended to my freinds and family ...I bet TRAVELLERS the owner a sharp answer NON APOLOGETIC ANSWER ...
5
In the heart of little India (don't let the Neighborhood deter you) lies the copper chimney, which at first glance appears to be a hole-in-the-wall like restaurant (those are usually the best!)We were five people out for a business dinner and were recommended the Chimney by a colleague.The restaurant was packed with locals with a few tables sitting tourists. The menu covered both vegetarian and meet dishes (chicken and lamb) as well as a few fish dishes. We sat up against the window to the kitchen, which in itself was quite the experience!)--filled with cooks pushing meet and bread dough into their ovens. The food was deliciousâ€”every single dish! Authentic in both spice and heat!Service was very friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed the night
5
a couple of friends and i were in singapore on a holiday and the indians that we are we were craving for indian or indian chinese food.. immediately looked up on the net and asked a few people for a nice place to eat and they recommended copper chimney..absolutely loved the place.. the staff were polite and always smiling.. the kababs were nice, overnight food is great.
5
It was so tirey day after santosa Ireland visit. We found a well known brand right opposite Mustafa centre..the plcace was full we waited for few minutes as we don't want to climb upstairs the waitress assist us and gave us a table we ordered quickly and got the food quickly as we were looking for.. thanks to the staff as they understand the hunger of kids .. the food was amazing specially Palak paneer,Roganjosh and butter chicken.. kids loved their mint drink which was the star of the show.. restaurant was very clean if I compare to other in that row. Not so bright or not too dark. Thanks
4
We had food in Copper chimney back home in India, in Mumbai. While shopping here in Mustafa Centre we chanced to find a Copper Chimney here in Singapore.The food was much better than what we had in India
5
We were 8 of us, My In-law's are into Indian food and they were disappointed with the Chinese and the Indian restaurants we visited. So I did some research an found this place. And to our surprise it turned out to be the highlight of our trips culinary delights. My In-laws loved it so much they were telling all their friends when we got back to Bombay. I have to be honest, I don't normally write reviews, but this place impressed us all so much that I felt compelled to share our experience , so if someone wants amazing Indian food in Singapore, this is the place. I salute the people running this place for the delicious food they served and also the waitering staff , as we ordered some dishes that were recommended by the waiter.
5
My wife and I where walking at Mustafa market and we saw this Indian restaurant and went to grab some lunch !!! The waiter recommended hara bara Kabab and panner chilly for starters and it was delicious. We could not expect such good food with proper blend of Indian masala and good taste. The people serving us were very warm and helpful. We visited it twice during our stay in Singapore. We have some friends in Singapore and we suggested this place to them as well. They too visited this restaurant and were happy with the overall food taste and service. It's a must try place for good Indian cuisine
5
The food was really tasty. I felt that I am eating Indian food in India plus the best service was given by Jasvir singh. I would say the food and the service was awesome..
4
This place was lovely . Very easy to find . Service was amazing and everyone had a smile on their face . We had a baby and they were very accomodating of her . I would recommend the sizzling brownie
5
Visited this place while I was on a work trip. Went there with three colleagues. After trying the local dishes for a few days, I started craving for Indian food. I love starters more than the main dish so tried them. The Tandoori chicken, Malai Tikka & Lollypops were really tasty with the garlic butter naan. The kakori kebab was fine.In the main course we tried the hot garlic chicken and the friend rice. The quantity was decent but the taste was very good! The staff was very polite and friendly. A must try for Indian food!
5
Before visiting here a couple of days back, I happened to read a few negative reviews about this place. I was a bit scared if these guys have actually dropped down their standards. But I remembered my previous experience and thought I should give it a try once again. This place never disappoints. This was my 4th visit to the restaurant and this time almost after 2 years. I am happy to express that the food quality and overall dining experience has just improved over these years. We ordered for a couple of dishes and all of them were just too good. Amazing taste and top notch quality. The highlights of our order was the "Butter Chicken" , "Fish Tikka Masala" and the "Lychi Kulfi" to die for. The staff is extremely courteous and friendly. We had our grand parents along on wheel chair, the staff helped us so very well to settle them in. All the best guys, keep it up. Note: I really wonder that the guys who've put up negative reviews of this place were just having a bad day probably and all they did on that day seemed wrong. Don't fall for such reviews.
5
We are in the group of eight persons in search of Indian food there we see the copper chimney fully crowded moreover people like to wait for there turn.After waiting 20 min our turns comes we placed our order very fast servive and exclusive Indian taste with good ambienc
5
I had been here with my frenz, wat an amazing experience it was ... The staff was well mannered. They explained the dish to us and also suggested a dish or two which I barely get to see these days. I wud suggest to visit the place and experience the ambiance the service and the delicious food
1
Came for lunch on my own. Being jetlagged and without my reading glasses I couldn't read menu. Waiter recommended butter chicken. I agreed but asked for Spivey.Five wait staff stood less than 3 metres away from me and took the piss out of me ordering a "spicey" butter chicken. I am not hard of hearing, nor am stupid. So rude!! I tried to cancel order and leave. Too late. Had to wait and eat food. Garlic Naan was small but ok. Butter chicken was just ok. Overall expensive and dissapointing experience for lunchBetter places nearby
5
We went here for lunch as well as dinner and food quality & taste were undoubtedly best among many Indian restaurants on this street. Starters we had - Paneer Chilly, Dry ManchurianMain course - Dal Tadka, Paneer Tikka Masala & Veg KolhapuriAll these are definitely recommended.Will definitely visit Copper Chimney when in Singapore again
1
Ate with my boss business dinner at this restaurant ..The food was not up to my expectation.The staff is all confused . Restaurant tables packed very closely to one another leaving no privacy from one table to another. Waiters constantly banging into our chairs. Noisy restaurant. Could not hear ourselves talk.Charges were very high for that type of dining. Will not visit agai
1
The food was really bad quality for the price we paid. The place lacks total service and the food has no taste. All arrogant staff. Food came to our table cold. If I wanted to have a cold meal I could have bought a sandwich from 7 eleven supermarket for a quarter the price I paid. We were treated like rubbish by the staff. There was flies in the restaurant, making this experience personally for me a health hazard. Our money and time did not matter to this cheap third class place. DO NOT GO. Pay more and eat at a decent place!
1
Visited this restaurant last ngth with the family. Manager was extremely rude ..Staff also with the same attitude. Rude and act English less. .The food came with no bread nan and we had to send the food back to make it hot again until they were ready with our nan was ready.Any restaurant being in business should know that .All the waiters are rude and disgraceful. .Don't waste your time going here and don't waste your money as well as they are overpriced. The shop next door is more popular
4
It has great food, best customer service, friendly staff and a homely feeling to it. We really enjoyed our dinner times after a long tiring day around singapore.
3
The food is strictly ok. The breads were a bit undercooked and the food was too bland for taste. Location is good - right opposite Mustafa but there are multiple good options if you have the patience.
4
Good place for Indian food lovers in Little India.Excellent North Indian Delicacies with wide variety of options. Must try.
1
Do not go to this place. The service was shocking! The worst service I have received in my entire life. I thought maybe the taste of the food will compensate for this disgraceful service and long wait but it only added to the shame of this terrible place. Don't be fooled how good this place looks from the outside like I was. The waiters are rude and so is the manager as we told him we felt uncomfortable with the waiters behaving like that. The wait for the food is unacceptable and the service in general is a shame. Eventually we did not want to say more as we did not want them spitting or doing anything to our food so we left them to continue their terrible cheap behaviour. There are many other restaurants down the road and next door to them, so go somewhere else and get value for your money or have a decent dining experience.This was a stressful and unpleasant dinner for me and my family. NEVER AGAI
3
Had lunch at this place after some shopping at Mustafa as it was just opposite . But I must say I was disappointed by both the speed of service and the quality of food. Also the place is a bit on the expensive side. You will spend about 60-80$ for a meal of 2-3 ppl. With so many choices around will give this a skip next time .
4
Located really well within Little India this restaurant serves good quality North Indian cuisine in a friendly and sociable environment. Lots of good veg and non veg options and helpful staff. Towards the more restaurant-like end of the spectrum of eateries available within Little India but still informal, accessible and inexpensive.
5
I absolutely love this place. Best Chinese, North Indian food and sizzling brownie. My personal favourites are the roomali roti, all North Indian dishes in the menu, the Chinese chicken garlic noodles, Manchurian and.. the icing on the cake- the best ever Sizzling brownie ❤️❤️❤️❤️They could do a better job with the schezwan rice and the chicken lollipop but sadly they aren't up to the mark. All other things are in the menu are A1 Keep up the good job
3
The food would have tasted better if it was seasoned properly. The wait staff who attended to us looked clueless. The service was slow. The appetiser was served before our drinks arrived. It took over 15 minutes for them to prepare coffee and tea. Didn’t enjoy the food nor the ambiance
5
Copper Chimney is located in Little India, just opposite the Mustafa Centre! Such an apt location: you shop at Mustafa and end up relishing delicious food after your retail therapy... We ended up at Copper Chimney for 3 lunches, trying different items every time... They dish out finger licking butter chicken & phulkas. Also, try their fish tikka! And all this at a decent price... A must visit place if you are around Little India..
5
Food was lovely. We were 7 of us and stayed at The Park Ferrar Park Hotel. Location is opposite Mustafa. Primarily Indian and Chinese cuisine. We had at least one meal a day at Copper Chimney. The service was quick and prompt and the good was very good (both Indian and Chinese). The staff were very friendly and pleasant. Definitely a place to have your Indian meals. Thanks Copper Chimney!!
3
We had one meal at restaurant food was okay, better options in vicinity.
Service was good.
location is nice just opposite Mustafa
4
We went for food on odd time @ 5:30 pm.
Still they offered good food. Nice palak paneer. Samosa . Hot roties.
Only problem in Singapore is cost.
@ 750 to 900 per person for normal food.
5
Palak Kofta and Harabara Kebab was my personal favorites here. Good customer service and hygiene place. Excellent place to have vegetarian food. Lassi is also good here. Quite expensive though but worth.
4
We had two meals at this restaurant and we were not disappointed. The food is delicious and authentic with a range of options. The staff is friendly and service is prompt.
5
Had the best Indian food here, staff were very friendly. Would recommend if you are in Singapore and want some good Indian food I would go here
4
In singapore it's tough to find good North Indian food. Copper chimney offers great North Indian food with wide range of options
3
Being an frequent visitor to this place , I love the food known for Indian Chinese but since last few visits they are dropping down with the quality of taste they used to have few months back .To the management please look into the quality & you will see lot of more patrons visiting you frequently .Hopefully will visits again...!!
5
Found this place just opposite the Mustafa center after a long visit sight seeing the area. places is very Clean and well presented it get my thumbs up for dinning of you're in the area food was well presented and not to expensive service was good and pleasurable waitress was very helpful in advising on selections of dishes.i started with Chicken Tika one of the best i ever had BUT the Prawns looked just as Goodthen Lamb Buna was just to die for could have had a bit more garlic in thou in all very nice place to eat it will be on my list next time i visit well done for making us feel welcome and relaxe
5
I went here on Easter Friday with 3 of my family.All I can say is the food was outstanding!For starters we had the salt and pepper prawns, chicken tikka, and pecora's ( these were especially good)Main courses rogan josh, alloo ghoobi (great), bhindi masala, and the black lentil dhal, butter roti and namm bread. All washed down with jugs of Tiger Beer.The food quality and flavours were really good and I highly recommend this restaurant.Thanks Vijay and all your staff
5
I went with my family and we really enjoyed their food, the prawns were really delicious and spicy, a must try. I don't mind to go there again and again to eat their prawns. Jabir
4
go for the kadai chicken and salt and pepper prawn. popular with indian population which is a good enough recommendatio
4
We wandered Little India and chanced upon Copper Chimney. Great value and typical friendly Indian restaurant atmosphere. Lots of locals prove the poin
4
this place offer you great variety of vegetarian n non vegetarian food.famous for their non veg varieties.good food quality, staff is friendly
4
Was brought to this great little place with some Indian business colleagues. What a cracking place it is. Beer served cold while we pondered the menu. In the end, I let my colleagues order and they made some excellent choices. The Dahi Ke Kebab and mint chutney was excellent, as was the mutton curry. A great range of vegetarian and meat based dishes to choose from. Great food, great service and reasonable prices
3
Clean, nice chairs, good set-up so you don't have to beg for utensils and napkins. But no reason to go back, as the food is so boring! We had veg pakora, butter chicken, kashmiri nan, salt & pepper prawns, and a few other things. Waste of time. Should have tasted a little of each and walked out and tried to find a place with good Indian food
4
Went here for lunch whilst in little India. Just across the road from the Mustafa shopping mall. Seating inside only and very pleasant and clean. Staff all friendly and helpful. Good menu and very good food, sizeable servings and very reasonable price. We had chicken tikka masala, Mutton rogan josh & saffron rice. Really tasty and delicious. Would recommend
5
This is the one place if you are really searching for north indian food. Tried vegetarian food and it tasted wonderfu
4
Near Mustafa, there are a number of indian restaurants dotting the streets. We chose this one as the ambience was better than the ones nearby. The service was prompt, the food was delicious and spicy and for a vegetarian like me, it was greatly satisfying. One irksome detail - the Wi-Fi wasn't working when I visited. This came as a surprise as before ordering we were told that the Wi-Fi would be available.
4
Garlic naan.. Shish kebab, mango lassi. Great afternoon snack after visiting the Mustspha center in little India
5
WowTry the chicken tikka starter I reckon the best I've ever had. All the food was fantastic and great friendly servic
5
We've picked this restaurant at random while looking for some place to eat that was still open in "Little India" one late evening so we didn't expect much, however we were amazed by both the authentic cuisine and very helpful staff. While the place looks quite simple with only a rudimentary decor, the food makes up for it. We've paid a little over 80 SGD for a great dinner and some beers
4
recommended to eat here by one of the hotel staff where we were staying. have to say we were not disappointed. The Restaurant is quite small, which we liked, it's basic, preferring to concentrate on the food rather than furniture and fittings.Ate well for a reasonable price.. $50 including drinks for the both of us.certainly will go bac
4
This is a good place to eat Indian cuisine. Family friendly, quick service, good food at a very decent price. It is situated right outside Mustafa so its a good place to go after a tiring shopping stint
5
Have visited Copper Chimney Restaurants in India and was having the same expectation here. Food was great. Just as we had hoped. We enjoyed our dinner. We found this best the compared to some other restaurants in this area. It is opposite Mustafa and would recommend it to others too
5
Found the food very nice and service was also very prompt. The decor is interesting and gives the place a unique feel
5
Now this is where i had the best indian food in singapore so Far !!The Location is convenient,its right opposite to the Mustafa Market.The food is Awesome.the Food menu has everything that an indian restaurant has.And the taste of the food is just how the Mughlai indian food should taste like.Overall its 9/10. must visit place.good atmosphere and amazing food
5
Best place to enjoy indian food in Singapore. :) they have few restaurant around singapore and you can find nearest place for your location. staff very friendly and helpful
5
Great place to have authentic Indian/Moghlai food in Singapore.After shopping at Mustafa this is the place one must visit to rejuvenate and stimulate one's taste buds.Staff is cheerful and ready to help you with the selection if you are new to Indian cuisine
5
Great place with yummy food. We had Indo Chinese food and it was yummy. They had nice vegetarian selection for me and great meat dishes for my husband. Great place for good food
4
First time i went there. Tried Beryani. It was good. According to my friend. They are one of best restaurant in Singapore. I found average.All food are Halal.Indian cuisine
5
Clean and refreshing. Good variety of of food. Well priced. Veg breyani was delicious. The sizzling hot chocolate brownie was the best. Definitely a muat try
4
Pleasantly surprised ! Good service , nice selection of breads (fresh & warm) , excellent dum bryani . Clever mix of cuisine. Clean too !
5
A very nice place and the service is awesome, whatever you choose from the menu is delicious (one of the best Lassi I have been taste) highly recommend to try
3
The place was quite may be because it was a week day but we did not mind it at all since we got all the attention. Choices are limited but once you have decided what you are going for, you will not be disappointed with its taste. The place offers chinese cuisine as well, but this is only for the indian taste not the genuine chinese food lover.you must end with the litchi kulfi
1
I visited this restaurant with my wife on a Sunday evening. We were seated quickly and placed our order within minutes. Subsequently two nearby tables were filled. Surprisingly, both those tables received their food well before we received ours. The mango lassis were the absolute worst we have ever had — very small glasses with plain lassi and drizzles of a sickly sweet mango syrup. Essentially undrinkable! The naan came to the table cold and neither the texture nor the flavor was memorable. Our other dishes were edible, but certainly far from delicious. We have had far better north Indian cuisine in Taipei, Japan, and both Canada and the US. The prices were well above what we are used to paying for food of much better quality. That customers at several other tables made little or no effort to quiet their unruly, screaming children did not improve this meal
4
Located in the heart of the little india. This restaurant is a pure treat for Indian food lovers. Thumbs up for the Chef who has kept the indianness intact in all the delicacies. Go for their Dal Makhani, Aloo Gobhi and Veg Jafrezi.You will surely not want to miss on the Pista Kulfi as well. Happy Dining!
5
Its an ideal place for descent Indian food, its lively and the food is tasty.its crowded on weekends, but it still is worth it.
5
I like the food here. I am eating almost daily. Staff is very friendly and welcoming.They even customize their menu items for customers satisfaction.Eating good food is my favourite thing in the whole world and nothing is more blissful than Copper Chimney
2
as soon as you enter you will feel that you have come to some road side place. service is very lethargic and food doesnt have taste at all. everything tastes the same
4
Food - Hara kabab and the main course was very tasty and one portion was sufficient for two. Prompt service and waiting time was not Long. Little disappointed that veg momos weren't there but I Guess we were too early visitors for it. Overall a good tasty food and recommended for service.
3
Some dishes can be pricey...but quality is decent, and service good. An average restaurant in food terms but good staff and nice catering options
3
The food is good but service is very slow and food is spicy and oily . Portions are descent, so you can enjoy the food
4
Visited little india in singapore looking for some good northern indian food...found it at COPPER CHIMNEY.good cold beer and hot food and friendly service.Ke
4
This place is located right opposite Mustafa Centre, which is easy to find. When we first received the food, we were a bit dismayed by the portion size, but realised that the food is actually really filling. The food is excellent and well prepared, especially the butter chicken, which is really tender and fragrant. The naan is also fantastic
5
We try to eat at least one Indian meal when travelling away from home. Today's visit for lunch at the Copper Chimney was great. Try the vegetable pakoras and the tandoori paneer (pictured). These two dishes were the highlight. As a previous reviewer said, the naan was exceptional! We tried butter chicken and mutton vindaloo. Both very good. They serve beer as well. It's right across from the big Indian department store in Little India.
4
We enjoyed our dinner at copper chimney but we where a bit disappointed by the size of the portions in relation to the price. And the Mango Lassi is way too expensive with 5.50 SD
4
Our 1st night in Singapore after exploring a little of "Mustafa" and we stumbled across this restaurant. It is nicely lit and was quite full of, mostly, indian people. After consultation with the staff we settled on some dishes that were new to us. The food was freshly cooked and had some interesting tastes for us. that was good. We would recommend this restaurant to all
4
My husband and I ate at this restaurant about 2 weeks ago and we found the food to be delicious and the quantity sufficient. The service was a little slow but that is understandable given that the restaurant was full. The selection of food is good providing plenty of choices for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The restaurant is well-kept and clean and we had a good dining experience. Recommended for good North Indian food
4
Copper Chimney takes you back to the India... The food is great with flavors of the North India. Must visit if you are an indian in love with the "Indian food
4
The Positives:- Good location, opposite of Mustafa Center- tasty food, not too spicy, good portion sizes; the naan here is fantastic- friendly,efficient service- air conditioned- prices okThe Negatives:- Interior a little no-frills/atmosphere just ok - during our dinner several delivery men came in, which gives a little bit a feel of being in a take away place rather than a restaurantOverall a good choice in Little India, will visit again
3
Food is ok though not so wow! Service is pretty good but would help if they make their starter portions abit bigger especially the fish tikka and chicken tikka. Not so bad!

We went there for dinner, after trying for other restaurants for 2 days, this was our one more try to explore different varieties of food. Copper Chimney never let us down, food was tasty and we loved it. Staff are very friendly and service is very good. On that day, WiFi was not working, they tried their best. Over all our experience was very good and we will love to come to this place again and agai

Located in Little India next to Mustafa Centre so quite a convenient for those foodies who crave North Indian Food and grills. Quite liked the cozy place, the fare though limited was very good- compliments to the chef. The people who waited on us were courteous and ready to help. Recommended to try while in Singapor

Amazing to have such good north indian food in Singapore. Smiling staff, great service with sumptuous food. Dont miss if in Singapore and want to eat North Indian food

This restaurant was close to where we stayed during our Singapore trip. Out of our 8 nights stay, we had 6 dinners here. The North Indian fare is yummy. The food is good, service is nice and not too expensive. Will definitely visit this place again when in Singapore.Visited in August 201

This is by far the best North Indian food you can get in Singapore. Do not be fooled by the many South Indian restaurants offering North Indian food in the lion city - it is basically a joke. Copper Chimney offers the best (in my opinion) North Indian fare with lovely, lip-smacking food.Location:The location is a bit difficult if you drive as it is right in the middle of Syed Alvi Road, outside of Mustafa. I usually park at the Race Course Road or so on. If you come by Taxi its much easier.Service:The service is a bit dull, but I don't seem to bother at all. I come here for the food. Period.Food:The best dish is the Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala (non veg) and Dal Maakhani (veg). Their Butter Garlic naans beat every place in Singapore hands down.Speed:The wait time is generally 15 minutes or less. Their kitchen is super fast. I would come back to try the Indianised Chinese food another day. I would definitely go back

The place has quick service and they serve a wonderful mint lemonade. Would recommend digging into the malai kebab and also the Chinese style chicken fried rice. For dessert don't forget to indulge in the sizzling brownie. It's an air conditioned restaurant and can get crowded on weekends. Best to visit after 2 pm on Sundays to avoid rush hour
5
Every thing over here is delicious from Dal to chola bhaturas, veg / non veg . Especially the starters . If order given on time you can use food panda. Or you can visit this place by MRT, Ferrer road is the nearest station which is around 12 min walking distance

one must had dinner with the family or friends,best for butter chicken and must try kulfi or rabri with gulab jamu
5
Singapore - it was a 7 nights and 8 days trip for us.We were 4 adult and 4 kids.Day 1 was spoiled with the poor services of Parkroyal at Kitchener Road and we were feeling very low.Day 1 food to some place was okay and we desperately needed some good one.God has been kind to us that my elder son could spot the restra.Food was amazing - everything.Whatever we ordered we finish last bite even.Do try Fish and Chilly garlic noodles of his place.I rate it 5 star.

I been to mustafa centre last month and came across many a indian restaurants around it. Its been over a month since i hadn't had indian food hence was desparate to have some authentic Dal makhni and butter chicken. After shopping at mustafa centre, i looked for some good known restaurants around and found copper chimney which is one of my favourite restaurants in india as well. Before ordering food, we asked the manager that we are looking for authentic north indian taste and doesnt want to go out of this place with a sad face. We ordered Dal makhni and Butter chicken along with some lacha paratha. The moment i had the first bite of Dal makhni and i immediately called up captain and ordered one more paratha. It was such a tasty food and i could not stop myself just eating my fingers along with food. I recommend this place to everyone who wants to have amazing indian food around Little india in Singapore. The cost of dishes were also not too high, only for main course we paid around SG$50. which was worth

Went with a group of 8 and easily got a table without reservations. It's very clean, efficiently staffed and the servers are pleasant without being pushy. The food is largely North Indian, and a little richer than the South Indian food i usually go for. Good chicken dishes. Highlights of the meal were the Fish Tikka Masala, which had nice big chunks of tasty, firm fish and the Gobi Manchurian (which is an Indian-Chinese cauliflower dish). Good veggie choice and the naans and roti were fresh and tasty. Rice portions are small, compared to South Indian places (but then, South Indians love mountains of rice with their food!). And some great icy-cold beers to wash it all down with
4
Went here with my family for a late dinner, crowded but good service. Bit expensive but worth the price for the quality food and service.
5
Authentic Indian food, the rootis and naans were very nice. Daal as good as what you get in India. Masala tea was also nice
4
I would recommend this place if you are non-veg. foodie. Good cosy place for drinks and food. Chicken dishes are definitely better than most of the items on menu.Loving management and ready to accommodate you without hesitation.A good amongst the other lot in this area
5
Its really good food what we ordered was up to our satisfaction we realky found is amazing food for indian taste buds keep rolling guy

 Recommended by another colleague. Went with 2 other colleagues on 22 May 2016.Clean restaurant and good ambience.Food ordered and review as below : Harabhara Kebab - too salty.Bhatura with Channa - Well balance. My friend like it. Plain n Garlic Naan - Garlic Naan a bit burnButter Chicken - Fish Tikka Masala - Good. The best dish of this meal.Mango Lassi - Averag
4
Butter chicken is awesome at this place. We went for dinner on Friday evening so had to wait for 30mins. But the food was worth the wait. We also tried its hakka noodle which was also good. Must visit for authentic north indian food
5
Love the food here and the staff are super nice. The Chinese Indian food is a real different experience and worth a try. Great food
5
We were looking for a good restaurant in Little India, and not having access to internet while roaming around, we decided to walk around and check out the dining options. As most places seemed to be more of the fast-food type, the options for sit down restaurants were slim. We chose this one as it looked nice inside and a relaxed atmosphere.The food was great, typical size portions for sharing. We were 2, ordered 4 dishes (rice, meat, veggie and appy) plus naan, and couldn't finish it all. Price was good, especially for Singapore. Definitely costlier than the other fast food places around, but you are paying restaurant pricing. Our entire meal, including a couple drinks, came out to $7

Copper Chimney -- think of it and it takes you to amazing food world.
probably thats the case in India.. and my expectation a tad too high.
food was good overall though..
best was chola bhature
4
Have had dinner multiple times during business visits. Its professionally managed and provided good tasty food. Slightly costlier but the quality, quantity and services almost matches the price. Neat service. Have had only veg items all items were good. If you want to have a slightly relaxed and good place to eat, this could be your place in Little India, right opposite to Mustafa shopping center
1
This was my favourite dining destination for Indian Chinese meal ,but now this place is dropping its standards & quality at a very low grade that I think its bit difficult to go back for another meal at this place,they do not care if there guest are enjoying the meal, as after complaining as well their was no response about from the service team.Over all have to think thrice to Visit agai
4
We ordered roomali roti which was super hot and soft to the core..with kadhai paneer and daal tadka..the taste was very nice and tasty blend of spices..the staff was very active and soft spoken and quick too..the place was very busy being a Friday night which was managed very nicely.
5
Singapore is home to a great Indian food. I love Indian food. The smell of spices, colorful dishes, variation of food from bread, exotic rice and herbs, exotic drinks, spices smell on the air. Those all represent the colors of India. that is exactly what i taste, smell and see in this simple restaurant. The indian who immigrated to Singapore eat here. They are locals now, yes they eat here. it tells everything. It is real taste, not a tourist trap restaurant. We go here everytime we go to Singapore. we surely will come here again soo
4
While I frequent their counter on L2 at MBFC Tower 3 for lunch, tried their chai-pakoras for a small get-together. The packing, service and efficiency was impressive...thumbs up
5
I feel good to review this restaurant. This is one of the best restaurant where I had food in my lifetime. I had visited this restaurant multiple times with my sweet wife. Any dish I tried here; I got amazed at the taste. You might feel little costly; but, it's true value for money. Guys, try this restaurant, otherwise you will definitely miss the taste of lifetime. You may feel I am overly inclined towards the restaurant. But, actually whatever I am saying its from my personal experience and satisfaction. Rest I will leave it to you to decide
4
I have visited Copper chimney multiple times in the past. Generally, I have tried their mushroom masala dish which I liked the most. However, recently learnt that they have discontinued. All in all a good place
5
You know a place is good when you are the only non Indian person in there. Indian food is best shared amongst others, unfortunately I was travelling alone so only got to eat a couple of dishes but they were very good. It's your typical busy Indian restaurant. Don't expect fine dining, don't expect hugely attentive waiters. Take the place for what it is - good food at good prices.
4
Had lunch there today, was a very clean restaurant , friendly staff, quick service although very busy. Set among all the vegetarian restaurants , was great to see a licenced restaurant. Manager was helpful and served us chilled bee
4
It is a very clean and neat place. Serving is fast. Food quality is OK. Over all it is a good restaurant.
4
Good Indian food, nice staff. My husband loved the butter chicken. Delicious mango lassi and different varieties of naan
4
Copper Chimney is right up there in my favourite restaurants list due to the fact that they serve delicious "indo-chinese" food! I'm a big fan of their tandoori chicken and chicken tikka as well, but I always prefer to have Indo-chinese in copper chimney. They are a bit pricey, but it's ok to go there once a while. The only problem with them is, they cannot make anything "semi-gravy". I had a terrible experience once asking them to make the chicken manchurian semi-gravy. There was too much of gravy and only a few chicken pieces in it. When I asked them to convert this as a semi-gravy, they simply poured gravy and brought it back! Otherwise, I love their food and the service is good too
5
Off the beaten track in little India but well worth the effort. I make this place a regular stop on my visits to Singapore. Food is outstanding with friendly and efficient service in a clean restaurant. Grab a table near the kitchen and you will be able to watch the chefs prepare the foo
5
This is a good place to have freshly prepared Indian food...and is reasonable on the wallet as well. its normally not very crowded either.
4
This is a good option for those looking for North Indian or chindian food in LittleIndia. The service was prompt. The place is decently hygienic and done up. It's definitely not a fine dining restaurant but it's so conveniently located opposite Mustafa that it gets a lot of foot falls.
5
Awesome indian food available with prompt service. Food tastes great. Would recomend to indian tourists to have their lunch or dinner over there. Value for money and great taste. The ambience makes you feel like indian restaurant
4
I and my colleague discovered this place while we were desperately looking for Indian food in Singapore. We were bit undecided if to go for South Indian or North Indian but eventually we settled down for this. Pros:1. Very tasty food2. Served wellCons:1. Delay in serving food but it could be because of the rushComment for the owner/manager: We realized only after reaching hotel that you have not billed us for pan. We owe you this and will surely pay in our next Singapore tri
3
Very nice indochinese foodBit expensive They serve water and dishes in copper utensils but they dont shine the copper glasses which defeats the purpose of calling it copper chimney and people going there to enjoy the shiny cutlery and serving dishesDisplay dishes were very good but food served in darkened black and ugly looking oxidised dishes Curry was amazingly served in a plastic ball like cheap melamine which with overuse had lots of marksI did confront the waiterHe said we clean utensils daily but only shine once in few weeks. Highly unacceptableIf you want the money keep the standardFood was goo
4
This restaurant is nearby to Mustafa center in Little India of Singapore. They are serving all verities of Indian food say South Indian, Punjabi, Chinese of Indian taste etc. including good non veg. dishes. They do serve all varieties of drinks. Interior is above average like Mumbai higher middle class restaurants. You enjoy the food as they do serve spicy food if you are fond of such food. It is giving value for your money spent
4
This is a Chinese / Indian restaurant. It's located in Little India and really does have very good food. Like spicy this is the place too. Great bread, and a mint drink was also great
5
Thanks for make my lunch special copper chimeny you make properly indian taste I loved it your services is good everything clean serve everything one by one light music nice sitting style so highly recommend to all if you are in singapore come in copper chimney to eat food thanks again
4
Went with a good friend. The Butter chicken was excellent. Lamb Roganjosh ok. The beers are as little pricey but they are anywhere in Singapore. We arrived at 6pm and was was very but by the tiem we left at 8pm was beginning to fill up
4
All in all a good place to eat good indian food and more over the place is clean and tidy. Menu offers variety of indian dishes. North indian food was good and of same taste as in india.
4
If you you want chili on the table and spicy foods, this is the place to eat. Staff are welcoming. It has a great value for money for a tourist like me. Il recommend this place to my friends who want to have taste of Indian cuisine.
3
Its really avg and not what name suggest it should be .... Service slow ... Quality not bad but average ... One can get better places to eat ...
3
I have been to copper chimney on previous occasions & been happy with the food. They recently had changed their whole kitchen team and the food went to worst. I was wondering how the people on other tables are enjoying their food. On complaining the manager, he said that the team has changed and they are trying to bring the food level to the previous.Hopefully it'll be better now. You have a lot of other good food options in the area too. Explore :
4
Situated right opposite Mustafa is this small restaurant that we have been a fan of for the last few years. The choice of North Indian food and the Indian Chinese food is fabulous and the taste is awesome. The live counter that shows the kitchen and the chefs is a hit with the kids as they are fully engaged with the chef's routines.The Indian desserts is surely a must have and so make sure that you leave some space for yourself
4
We ordered both Veg. & Non.Veg food which were with the perfect blend of spices just like you want it. Did not make me miss indian food when i was there. Tadka Dal was very delicious
4
Yes it is not the Famous India copper chimney ! So what??It is a nice mid ranged restaurant - bang opposite Mustafa. We went there for a late lunch and they were kind enough to customize paneer gravy to our taste.Good food and good service too. Definitely come back.The only issue we faced was - the restaurant next door had some construction wor going on and the noise was quite disturbing - not sure if the hotel staff could have done anything about it though.All in all recommended if you are near Mustafa and craving North Indian food
5
Delicious Salt and Pepper Baby Corn. Fast service and all the food was delicious. Sorry I missed the Sizzling Brownie with Ice Cream. A nice little place to relax after a busy day of shopping
1
While roaming in little india to find a good north Indian restaurants, came across this place. ... it's v bad experience, cuz of bad ambiance, average food and stupid + unfriendly staff.... normal food which should take 10 minutes, took 30 mins to get ready.... It's fake, they don't belong to the reputed Indian chain..
4
Best restaurant for Indian, Indian chinese and singapore cuisine ! amazing taste though bit expensive but full value of money 
3
Got conned by the name. This is not related to the reputed chain of eateries in India. However, the food was decent and the staff was warm and helpful
4
Copper chimney branch of the famous Bombay eatery has very good tandoori chicken & Mutton Roganjosh & their nan's & chapati were also very goo
4
I shared the chicken dum biryani, butter chicken and garlic naan with a friend, and it was enough for the both of us. The butter chicken was tasty and the naan was great, but I think the biryani was average. The rice was slightly undercooked I think and the quality was sub-par compared to other indian restaurants I've been to. As for dessert, I found the sizzling ice cream brownie to be delicious.Overall, the food I had was quite good, although I wish the portion for the butter chicken could be slightly bigger
4
My friend and I went here when we visited Mustafa Center. The place looks quite clean. The staff are nice. I really loved food. Palak Paneer was so delicious with the flatbread which you can also choose from plain, garlic etc. The Calamansi Lime shake was also nice to drink.
3
Located right in front of Mustafa Center in Little India this place offers good food. We ordered Dal tadka , Kadai Paneer and Naans. Bill came to S$46 for 4 of us.taste good but a little costly when compared to other restaurants nearby
4
Copper chimney is a cosy and popular food joint in Little India ,Singapore.Mostly north Indian cuisine they served. Indo Chininese also available there.Various cocktail and moctail also are in the menu.kebabs are the main attraction.Biryani specially veg biryani is speciality.service is good
5
On a tired evening, after long shopping hours in Mustafa market Copper Chimney welcomes you for a great eating experience. The Indian cuisine is a relish in a distant land away from India. Freshly prepared appetizing meal makes the taste buds go wagging
3
Had Chicken Schezwan noodles for a quick dinner and washed it down with frsh lime soda.The noodles were okay.
5
Just have been today with family @ copper chimney Singapore opposite Mustafa market and found it delicious. The food quality was excellent and the service was also quick at 12 in the midnight
5
We ordered fish tikka and chicken tikka with pratta and it was delicious! Must try! It was almost 10.30pm but they still accepting order without rushing their customer. I like that
3
This hotel is located in very busy area near Mustafa Centre. Food quality is good. It is suitable for having lunch & dinner. Indian veg & non veg food is available. Service is average. Restaurant is expensive, with regard to the food quality, service & ambience
4
If you're looking for a well lit, clean and comfortable place for decently good Indian food, this is it. The menus and tables were clean. Place was comfortable. Service was prompt. I had butter chicken and naan. It was tasty.
3
We ended up at this restaurant by chance. Our plan was to taste South Indian food. But the place was closed so we decided to go for copper chimney. Being a public holiday we were expecting the place to be crowded. It was almost full with few empty tables & people were moving around. The decor is nicely done. It has a nice polished look in terms of interiors. We ordered bread basket, daal, malai kofta and veg dum biryani. In the drinks I ordered Mint Calamasi which was really refreshing. We had to wait for quite some time for the food. The plates were placed on the table the moment we finished placing the order. We had 2 small kids with us. We were bit surprised that our request to replace one of the bread in the bread basket with another one (phulka) was not accepted. Usually such requests are accepted without much problem. No hard feelings about it though. The food quantity was good. We could not finish everything. We ended up taking away the remaining food packed for our dinner. The Daal was one of the best I have ever had. It was cooked nicely with all the ingredients. Malai kofta was ok. The gravy was good but kofta were bit hard. The bread basket was also good in proportion. The dum biryani was bit of a let down. I think the vegetables were overcooked and it had a prominent taste of burnt veggies. It could have been much better. We had to wait for a long time to get our bill as well. Based on this experience i would say the place is ok. I am not very sure I will visit it again. If i come i would lke to see a better service.

LikedGood food, tastyDecent portionsDislikedSlow service, almost went to sleep waiting for the foodA tad costlySaw a rat running into the kitchen from the wash area
4
My tastebuds were surprised over and over again! For starters the Salt and Pepper baby corn worked out an appetite for me. Crunchy baby corn coated in pepper batter. Goes very well with the mint calamansi. A refreshing twist from the usual calamansi drink! I had the impression that anything that comes through a tandoor oven is usually dry, but I was impressed by how moist and flavorful the malai chicken tika was.Butter chicken and the Rumali thin bread is a match made in haven. LOVE IT!!!Desserts were pretty impressive too. The lychee Kulfi (Ice cream) and sizzling brownie with ice cream is a must try
5
Very nice Indian food my kids loved too much I had to have lunch dinner there at this Indian restaurant and the five stars u see are asked by my daughter Anannya to give to restaurant as she fan of this restaurant veg food and they had a sticker at entrance on their restaurant that grade us on trip advisor . Really awesome food authentic I loved it to
3
Good and service were average , nothing to complain about . Could have been better with cold water served to the tables , more quick and professional service . Cut green chillies in the curries are like hidden and can cause problem. But had a decent evening over all 
5
It was a hectic day of shopping in Mustafa and we came out with a dull face with sweat and disparate to lay down in our bed but suddenly we saw a tempting and familiar name Copper chimney so we decided to go in and first impression was like wow nice clean restaurant not so colourful like others there in the row.. We welcomed well and got a table in front of the drink counter. We were very hungry and tired so we order quickly some assorted naan roti, prawn in salt and pepper, sizzling meat platter nice juicy and flavourful assorted kebabs. Ask for recommendation and recommended butter chicken Kadhai chicken and palak kofta with peach ice tea and spicy guava juice drink a perfect match with Indian food. We loved everything there and we went out with a smile on our face. Thank you Sanish for your great service and recommendation . This place is a must try if you are in lil India. Reasonable price .We will defiantly see you again.. Cheers......
4
Really nice to have the Indian taste in Singapore. Nice space, atmoshpere and food. Feel like being in India. Must visit for Indian food. It is opposite to Mustafa Mall at Little India.
5
When I first entered, the simple but yet very elegant decor made me feel very nice about the restaurant. The staff were very polite and helpful. We ate the Chicken Malai Tikka and Crispy Baby Corn as the appetizer, trust me it was delicious. Felt like ordering one more portion of the Crispy Baby Corn but had to eat the main course yet. Then we ordered the Butter Chicken; which was by far one of the best butter chickens ever eaten. At first before we ordered, we thought it cannot be better than the Butter Chicken we eat back in India. After we grabbed in the first bite with Hot Butter Naan and Butter Chicken I couldnt have asked for anything better. To end it on sweet note we had their special Lychee Kulfi, which was just too awesome. All in all a great experience and will definitely go back when in Singapore. Forgot to mention, try their Mint Calamansi and Guava drink it is a super refresher in warm climate of Singapore
5
I make sure to stop here every time I'm in SG...as a vegetarian I truly love their options. Every dish we've tried is so flavorful and delicious. A must try for sure
3
This is a small resto in little India where you get a good combo of Indian Chinese food. It is a good place to eat with good service. The food is fairly priced and I am quite a regular there. Try it
3
I am a frequent visitor of copper chimney for past 3 years. I genuinely liked the taste and flavors both north Indian and Indian Chinese cuisines have.However one thing I really hope the management takes note of is decreasing quantity and increasing prices. It is quite sad that higher costs in Singapore of raw materials and other reasons have led this restaurant decrease the quantity and proportion of food. Chicken lollipop were served in 6 pieces which then became 5 and now just 4 are served. The prices are sky rocketing. As a loyal customer I wouldn't mind spending about a dollar more on a dish. But it's essential you increase the qty to 5 or 6 pieces. Also I did a takeaway last week. Neither was the lollipop dish garnished with spring onions nor was the dish value for money. I was given just 2 normal sized wings whereas other two could be consumed in 2.5 bites. Was this deception just coz I did takeaway and not because I sat in Ur restaurant!!It's a request to into this matter and take appropriate steps accordingly.Thanks for the good service, ambience and keeping the flavours intact
3
I could not review much as I did not have full range of foods but following are the rating based on observation:1.) ambiance - 3* : nice & simple decor with comfortable seats 2.) Service - 2* :few part timers hired which they have no clue on Indian cuisine. I ask which bread is the wheat flour made and all she answered we have Naan and Romali. 3.) Menu - 1* : Quite repetitive and description ain't that straight forward. A lot of explanation can be saved with a comprehensive menu. 4.) Food itself: 4* The Fish Dum Briyani was superb. Very flavorful and quite healty cooking style. The fish grill that comes with it is very juicy and tender. Dash of lime taste with the fish simply superb. However the masala tea is quite expensive and tasteless. You guys have to improve on beverage and lassi is below average taste as well. This place suits tourist taste bud more than locals who are on the hunt for frequent great food. However if you all like a quality Briyani then you can make your way here

Two aussies wandered into this place not knowing what to expect, but saw a clean, moderately busy place and thought we'd try it out. Were welcomed by a friendly waiter with an ipad of sorts assisting with taking orders. Waiter was EXTREMLY helpful in explaining the dishes and was very patient with us. We ordered a chicken and veg soup which came with fried noodles on top..(it was described the thicker of the two on offer)..this however was too spicy for my mum..(chilli?)The waiter saw this, and generously offered a less spicy soup, but mum decided to try chicken spring rolls instead..these however were not nice at all. Dish came with 5 rolls and she only had 1 bite and left the rest.Plates were put on table early and water given.I ordered butter chicken, plain rice, plain roti and it was all AWESOME! The tastiest butter chicken ive ever had! The quality of the chicken was great...and im a fussy eater. I thought it was a good sized serve too.Price was very cheap. Waiter extremely helpful.Place very clean.Will go back :
4
We found this place by chance and wandered in there. The place it felt as if we were back home and we were greeted with the smelt of authentic Indian food. The place felt a bit understaffed as we could only see two servers between twenty odd tables. The food tasted great. Just hope they improve their service
3
I went today for dinner at this restaurant with my friends.. We had to wait over 15 minutes before someone came to attend us. Even after we ordered our starters, which were delivered shortly after, there were NO plates in front of us! Really, I had to call for plates after sitting 20 minutes in a restaurant.. Wasn't cool!Food was good though, no complaints but not good enough to compensate for the lack of attention and service
4
Few years back I was introduced to this restaurant By my sister and mom. Than the food was nice. Something different as it had the chindian variety. The indian dishes were made well with great spices in the correct proportion with wonderful aroma. But personally for sometime some dishes were than made differently & standard dropped. Stopped gong for sometime.One final day when I was nearby n dint know what to get I just decided to give it a go & never regretted my decision. Since than good has improved and it's one of my regular spots. With wonderful service from some of their staff, I'd like to recommend their manager Inder who personally serves my family and also puts in a nice smile and plays with my 11 month old baby. It's def a nice family restaurant to dine in.

Lots of improvement needed. Have been to many such indian restaurants in Singapore and other countries. Food are too spicy and many dishes are not authentic in taste (for example the chili chicken tastes like Chicken manchurian etc). Very late service as they forgot to serve us for more than 30 mins TWICE and we had to remind them and finally cancel the last bit. I have been to the original copper chimney in Mumbai almost 20 years ago and still hold a high esteem of this brand. Hope you can do better next time I visit
3
We visited this place by mistake, we thought it's sankrathi, and then realized it's copper chimney after coming in, and thought of giving it a try. Pros :Ambience- awesome. Some dishes tasted gr8- plain naan, veg biriyaniCons :They took lot of time to serve. A little pricy than the others in that area. Tandoori roti was totally bad, they were very hard. Veg kolhapuri can be improved.
4
i visited this restaurant with my family...they have kept things simple..white wall and bollywood romantic songs..WOW..a nice place in littel india...with ordered Chicken Manchow Soup, butter chicken, nans, rice and dal makani...very Flavourful and tasty...the fresh lime soda could improve...the staff is very friendly...they r quick in getting the starters but very slow when came to the main course...but since the food was amazing the waiting part was totally worth it.... a definite place to drop by if one is in little india or mustafa..
4
It is located bang opposite of Mustafa shopping centre... We were tired of the shopping in Mustafa and wanted a place to drop and fill up our tummies... and we walked into this place... thier Chicken Keema with Batura is really very good... Tandoori also is really good... and prices are also fairly decent.. service is a bit on the slower side... but good.. mango lassi was also very good..

I have been craving for Indian chinese food for about a year now and till now all the restaurants I have been to were hopeless.I decided to re-visit Copper Chimney this time (the reason I hesitated in the past year was because they had put peanuts in chicken manchurian and I was totally disgusted by it)I have to say this is going to be THE favorite place of mine considering my addiction with indian chinese food. I ordered chicken lollipop, chicken manchurian, schezwan fried rice, tandoori chicken and chicken fried rice. Each and every dish was mind blowing. Well cooked and filled with genuine flavors. The waiter was very friendly and this enhanced the whole experience of choosing the right dishes. He even apologized for putting peanuts in manchurian before even when it wasnt his fault.. Lol..Really sweet!The restaurant is spacious and best time to visit is between 2-4pm. It's a bit less crowded than evening time. Thanks for treating my taste buds! Kudos guys

Returning to Little India in Singapore after a break of several years, we emerged from the narrow lanes between stalls in the various bazaars to see the first plump drops of monsoon rain hitting the pavement.Lunch was on the agenda and not wishing to get soaked we headed for the nearest available sign, Copper Chimney in Syed Alwi Road. It was a lottery â€“ and one we were very happy to win. The interior of the restaurant is plain: No pictures of the Taj Mahal on the wall, no large statues of Ganesh, but the food was excellent. I had a vindaloo curry served on a thali with katori bowls. I asked for medium hot and got exactly what I wanted.Johnny, in charge that day, was sympathetic when I told him my gluten intolerance meant no chapattis for me. As a result I cannot eat Indian food in the traditional way, but forks and spoons were quickly provided.We lingered over the food while the rain drenched everything and everyone outside; anyway, the meal was too good to bolt down, even if there were many things still to do during our short stay in the island State. By the time we were ready to leave, the weather had improved and the sun was trying to force its way through leaden clouds. Pleasantly sated, we drifted through the late afternoon

it was a busy New Year holiday and little india was packed! our usual restaurant, opposite Mustafa Center, was packed out! otherwise we would not have had the chance to experience the very good food at The Copper Chimney!!! if only you could find food, this quality in India. staff were helpful and efficient, serves were generous and the ingredients were fresh! ok this quality is reflected by the price being higher than the average restaurant in this area! dishes where cooked to order so not "instant service". try it for yourself

For the Indian traveller whose gastronomic needs would only be fulfilled with good Indian food,,,,this is a good recommendation. I visited the outlet at Little India. Its decent with tasty food, moderate pricing, average ambience, but not so good locality

Located opposite mustafa centre in little india. It is clean & spacious. The food tastes fine but not gr8..It is a bit pricey too as compared to other eating joints...The staff can greet with a smile...serving to be improved.

This is the first time I am eating here at the introduction of an office colleague. I am Chinese and I went with a group which was 80% Chinese. The only hint of disappointment I had was the papadum and it was rectified right away with a fresh and crispy set after we complained of soggy and rubbery properties on the first set.Anyway its unfortunate that I cannot name all the dished but I was not disappointed in what we ordered e.g. butter chicken, fish curry, the fried noodles (almost Chinese style), the naan, curry mutton, and chilli lamb. It was in one word - delicious. Could I be someone that has simple tastes or easily pleased I am not sure. Reason I asked this question is because of all the other reviews I have read, some of which are just downright negative. I had none of the experiences of the other reviewers and I am certainly not related to any of the owners or the management. Speaking of management we were well served and we had every order processed at high speed and the food came out piping hot. I wouldn't recommend takeout because this kind of food has to be served hot and it cannot be given a chance to cool down. I would certainly bring some of my Chinese friends who love curry to give this place a shot and hopefully they will give a review as well. Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews. If anything I believe that the food standard is very good and the taste certainly better than some of the restaurants I have tried at nearby Race Course Road.Will definitely be back

As the title says, today I ate the worst Indian food in the city at Copper Chimney. My order was simple-Mughlai chicken and Tandoori Roti. The former is one of the very basic Indian recipe, if you can’t make this taste right you can’t make anything taste good.Chicken was undercooked and smelly. And the gravy had no flavor whatsoever, all I could taste was heavy cream. Poached egg garnish was totally out of the place. With this kind of flavoring characteristics it didn’t even qualify to be an Indian food. I was bored while eating this heavy cream dip, and sick in stomach after. Neither I will come back here nor will recommend to anyone

I had been to this restaurant with a diverse group from different ethnic background. As soon as we sat there were flies buzzing around us and we still ordered food. It was average. They could have at least install an electronic bug zapper. Food was served later. Wine was served at room temperature. Usually it will be served chill, as we are sipping, the wine temperature will be same as the room temperature. it also enhances the taste. they don`t seem to bother with enhancing the customer dining experience. If you are not bothered about service or a good dining experience, you can definitely step in there and don`t complain

We had dinner at Copper Chimney. The restaurant is clean with an open concept kitchen, however, no smell in the restaurant which was great. The food took a little long to get to us, which was fine, it meant that they were preparing it and not just heating it ... The food taste was pretty good. We ordered the schewan lamb and chilli chicken and egg friend rice with one naan. The portion sizes are quite small. The naan was not as thick as it should be. We ordered a fresh lime soda which cost us $4.50 each and this was served in a very narrow glass of about 10cm - definitely not worth $4.50. They serve the food in smaller serving bowls that is piled quite high, however, this trick does not work as the portion is probably half the size of what you would expect at a nearby restaurant. Though we liked the food and to be honest we could get this at any other restaurant serving indo chinese food, we would not go back as it is way too pricey and we can get the same around the area. For two people we paid $53 and we still left hungry ... The staff could also be a little friendly - maybe a smile would be nice considering the competition out there ..

One day, my family decided to have Indian food and so we went to this restaurant in little India named Copper Chimney. Walking out of the restaurant, I had mixed feelings.Firstly, the wait for the food was REALLY long, almost 20 minutes. It made my family really hungry and restless.Secondly, when the food arrived, most of the portion of the food is really big. (Contrary to what the waiter said, "the food's not enough for four". Thirdly, the food was very disappointing. The quality of the food was really, rather poor.However, putting aside the flaws of the restaurant, I have to give it to them for keeping the restaurant really clean. I notice that whenever a patron leaves, a waiter will immediately wipe the table. Food recommendation: Vegetarian Hakka Noodles

Copper Chimney is a good place with authentic Indian food bang opposite mustafa. Nice pleasant ambience, reasonably quick service and tasty food, the only trouble is that at the location this restaurant is at one would expect to either pay less or get more food or a bit of both. Talking a bit more about the food, any Indian in Singapore will know that the Chinese you ate in India is really far far away from the Chinese food you get here but if you're looking for that Indian Chinese taste copper chimney is a good bet. All in all a good experience, left me with my pocket slightly lighter than I would have liked but if I'm craving the taste I would visit again

Had dinner with a group. Tasty food but takes way too long to be served. Had an All vegetarian Fare with Tava Chappathis and Kulchaa, asked for a Spicy Gobhi Dish and it just about touched the tip of being Spicey!The Okhra dish was superb though.Waiters move at their own pace and had to be prodded to bring the Check in reasonable time! With the Quality of food they serve, I would rank them higher if only for the Servic

We have dined at copper chimney a number of times and most recently in Jul 2004. This time around the food was excellent and we all enjoyed it. However just a couple of months ago the good was horrible and we were thoroughly disappointed. Sometimes their music is so loud that you want to quickly finish your food and get out.. Am really confused with this sometimes good, sometimes not so good food.

I opted for an Indian menu and the food was good. Ordered Chicken and Mutton wrap and vegetarian Biryani. The wraps were not Hot when served, disappointing. The order took some time to arrive, in spite of only three tables occupied. Coming on to tasteWraps tasted yum, they were good. I would have rated 5 stars if they were served hot. They were not even warm. Vegetable biryani was very good, the rice was long grain and it absorbed the mild flavor of the masalas. Overall a good place, ambiance was nice, bang on the main road and ample sitting space. Recommended

This was the most genuine Indian food we had tasted while we stayed in Singapore. The daal & rice was awesome. In Singapore INdian food is a little bland else where. This place had good ambience & quick service.
4
Located in Little India. I liked everything from of the hotel, food, service and clean restaurant. But it is not a budget restaurant, so for the sake of change you can have one of your dinner here. It will cost appx 25-27 SGD for two person with normal die
3
Ordered a whole lot of Indianized chinese food and was amazed with how good it all tasted! Didnt have anything else so cannot comment, the service was a bit on the slower side, but we didnt mind as we were talking and didnt realize how long it took to get the food on the tabl
3
Possibly the best Butter Roti I had in Singapore. Overall the food is good but the service is unreasonably slow. Beer that was ordered never served but charged! Asked for bill three times and had to wait for 20 min. At the end, we approach cashier and paid. Its a pity. With this quality of food, they can lift themselves to higher reputation if service improves

Dined here recently with my wife on a Saturday evening when the restaurant was almost full. Ordered tomato soup, chicken tikka hariyali starters, cheese naan and tandoori rotti mains, daal tadka for sides and pista kulfi for desserts. The tomato soup was totally disappointing. It was very bland and greasy. There were tiny bits of tomato in the bowl and totally unjustified to call it a tomato soup. The naan and tandoori were good though. The daal tadka was disappointing too. It's one one the most simplest dish to make and hard to go wrong yet it was bland and flavourless. Kulfi was the only dish that was pleasing enough but I'm not sure whether is restaurant made or those ready-to-serve from supermarket. Overall, it's a below average restaurant.

We were about 5 people dined out on week day and there was hardly few table occupied . Our orders finished 8.20 PM and one starter dish arrived after 30 mins , remaining starters took 25-30 mins to serve !! main course we ordered chef recommended fish tika curry which comes with horrible cheese toppings , fish curry with cheese horrible !! and finally billl comes with 10% service charge on top of GST. terrific experience and never go to this place
4
Being indian you are always looking for good indian food in Singapore. This restaurant located near Mustafa in little india, has some lovely food.The decor is ok but the food is great.A must go if you like indian foo
3
DISLIKED: surely cannot compare with the copper chimney in Mumbai city. but service was slow - Our salad never came until we finished our dinner. the one that came was with a thick hair loose between the veggies - i wonder how even the kitchen staff couldn't see & neither our server & neither the manager/owner who was there even offered any regrets, if any!! Surely can miss it - better places are around this area.Near Mustafa shopping mall.
3
We went out for dinner late at night and found this restaurant that looks descent, takes around 20 mins to make our orders and bayarni taste a bit blend, service is ok but price is high compare to other restaurants in the area
4
Went there for lunch for 4 people just after lunch time. The food was very tasty (albeit a little on the expensive side, but as a popular restaurant this can be overlooked). The portions were more than sufficient and the veg biryani was amazing! Service was fast and our server was polite and attentive. I would definitely come back here again :)
3
Having Indian food in Singapore was a bad idea...the food quantity was disappointing, and so was the taste. Expected a lot more from Copper Chimney.
4
The best indian food i had in the entire trip...True or even better flavour of india...Located in Little india near the mustafa centre..after shopping when you are hungry ,...this is the place to be for food and grab couple of drinks...Order wisely...Not expensive thoug

I went to this traditional indian restaurant with a friend who recommended this place. It is in the very crowded area next to Mustafa Center, and it seems to be necessary to make a reservation, as it was completely full. We were the only people in the restaurant that did not look like indians. There were many families with kids. You should like that, otherwise I would recommend to avoid that area. The restaurant offers real indian food of typical north indian style. They also have some other dishes which are a fusion of indian and chinese style. We only tried the traditional indian food as I love it. All dishes were very good as well as the service
5
One of the best IndoChinese foods :)Went with staff's recommendation for the dishes.Fantastic food and pleasant experience
1
Went there last night after shopping at mustafa. Upon reaching there was no one to greet and show us to a table. Found the table had to wait a while to be noticed and again had to ask for someone to take order. Food was below average we tried chicken tika seekh kebab and mutton sagwala. I would not recomend this place
3
We had dinner at this place. The food quality was just ok, not very tasty food but the service was really pathetic and person who was serving was rude. we waited for just one simple mix veg dish and 4 butter naan, for almost 45 min and when we reminded the waiter he spoke rudely. Not at all recommended as food and service both are average
5
Food is incredible tasty.The butter chicken & garlic naan , is fantastic . Should come and try the food . The service is good too .
4
Easily accessible location at little India. We had butter chicken, naan, rice and papdi chats. Very generous servings and the food is tasty! Slightly on the spicy side, but will definitely go back for more. :
5
This restaurant was recommended to us by a local and we were not disappointed. Probably the best Butter Chicken we have ever had, same for the Tandoor Chicken. I am still raving about the Naan bread. Service was exceptional and very friendly. I will definitely be going back on future visits to Singapore.

I went to Copper Chimney restaurant (Little India-Singapore) with one of my friend, and order One starter, two main items (Palak Paneer and Chicken masala tikka) with one steam rice. We were surprised to see the smaller portion of the rice served (usually one steam rice is enough for two light dinner) but we thought it may the restaurant way. so later we order another rice and finish our dinner. But I was disappointed when saw a much bigger size of rice bowl on another single customer's table even-though although the restaurant only serve one price steam rice i.e S$4. Later I tried to ask the cashier, his reply was both the bowl size is same and the contain same amount of rice.But to us it was simply a DIRTY TRICK TO GET SOME EXTRA MONEY FROM THE CUSTOMER. I ADVICE YOU TO AVOID GOING COPPER CHIMNEY AT LITTLE INDI
4
They are located in the Food court (2nd Floor) in Raffles City shopping Centre .The food is descent & service is quick. You need to reach here a bit early (max. by 8pm) othyerwise you may have to eat the leftover options.
5
Chicken tikka was the best we have ever had. Mains of mutton rogan josh and goa fish curry were also nice. Service was good as well. Overall one of the best Indian meals in recent years
4
The best Indian chinese food in singapore. Although its famus for indian chinese but trying on north indian cuisine also works well. Scz. rice and paneer chilly a must must must try
5
We absolutely enjoyed all the dishes we ordered! The Szechwan fried rice took us by surprise. Who knew the indian version of the Chinese dish would taste so good? Restaurant was spacious and service was fast plus it is easy to find just being opposite Mustafa so that's convenient for us. We'll be coming back often
5
I have liked the Indian fare at this restaurant before, and decided to try Indian Chinese this time ... it was terrific - the meat was fresh (not the refried variety), and sauces were well balanced - authentic Indian Chinese. I have gone back x2 since the first time.
4
Best Indian food we've had while travelling. Our waiter was lovely and very helpful. The restaurant was basic but looked very clean. We ordered daal, butter chicken, palak paneer, veg kofta and garlic naan. All were delicious. I don't eat chicken but the others were saying it was the best butter chicken they've ever had. Would highly recommend this place
2
The quality of food and taste are deteriorating on my every visit, may be they don't like me :-). I never wanted to go here at the first place but my friends insisted and like I every time I was disappointed. With my older experience of eating heavily spiced/tomato "Indo-Chinese food" I tried to go for something that every North Indian restaurant should do well - "Tandoori Chicken". I did get Tandoori Chicken but at least half of it burnt. It was mostly black on one side and on other the meaty part was having the burnt crunchy black flakes all around. Serving staff is too less for a restaurant having a seating capacity of 50+ (just guessing the no. +/- 10).Chef needs to work hard to really rock this restaurant, it is right on the busy street and looks neat and really has the appetite to attract people but the food, essence of dining surely lacks 
1
Was highly recommended to try out by a friend - was sadly disappointed by the quality of food and was left nursing indigestion for the rest of the night. The Kheema was super salty, bhatura super sweet and the methi mutter was super sweet as well. The only thing that was dead on was the rice :)I wondered if the chef/cook was actually tasting their food before it left the kitchen. I will not be going there anytime soon

It is genuinely difficult to find non South Indian food in Singapore. Though very good local Indian food is available at hawker centers and various chains like Apollo Leaf, Gayatri, Samy's Curry, to find decent North Indian and Indian Chinese food is a struggle. That is where Copper Chimney comes to rescue. All the dishes, while not excellent are close to authentic. The biryani is actually made on dum & the naan is not roti prata dough shaped in oval.Just a pity that they keep on shelving some of our favourite items from menu like Murg Mumtaz & Darsaan. But the recent addition of Lychee Kulfi is excellent. My kids love this place enough to visit at least once in 3 months. So far nothing that we have tasted is negative. A perfect end to shopping spree at Mustafa
5
If someone knows North Indian food on Syed Alwi Road then those are Copper Chimney people. We ate there in July and had one of the best meals in Singapore (we had tried 4 more restaurants on same road and it was our second last day there). They were a bit costly than others at SGD 20 per person but the food was good and we had a hearty meal there. Not sure about other cuisines but North Indian good is of best quality (we ate that only) . Shocked to see them at 900+ Rank on TripAdvisor. It seems I need to explore more restaurants on my next trip. Will keep you posted when I do that
5
Warm welcome smile.. co operatve staff... decent service...
Costlier than resturants arnd bt tastes very desi... $11-$13 for max dishes... visited twice in 4 day stay at Singapore.
Highly recommended
4
Very clean place with excellent food. Service was wonderful and very pleasant atmosphere. Wonderful selections and great taste. Would return and bring frends.
4
Very costly when converting Indian rupees to Singapore dollar, Average of S$ 10 for most items. But Price is reasonable when compared to Singapore. Very Tasty food and hygienic surroundings.
5
Located directly across the road from Mustafas department store we enjoyed peace quite and an absolutely fantastic butter chicken with real service from a team that clearly had a passion for Indian food.
3
Me and my wife went there on Saturday noon. The service was fast , ambience was ok. Masala Papad was just delicious, probably best we had in Singapore so far. If you are person who loves spicy food, then you will like it as well. In the main course we ordered Dum Aaloo and Palak Kofta. We liked Dum Aaloo better than Palak Kofta. Breads - Garlic Naan, Rumali Roti and Phulka were all good. We ordered Fresh Lime Soda as well, which was again as expected and good one. Overall we spent about $20 per person
3
The food is average and not a value for money. The service is fine and the portions are very less so you have to order more than needed
3
The food is average - nothing stands out as exceptional and nothing is non-palatable. The location has a natural crowd pulling ability - tourist hotspot especially of the Indian variety as well as local populace for buying daily groceries and supplies. Given this, the restaurant is never jam packed unlike say an Anjappar which is right next door. The food however, is of the North Indian variety. So those who do not like "kari patta" in all and sundry recipes and want a taste of typical cuisine from the North (of the Vindhyas and not North as in Kashmir) of the country should head for this place - at least to try it out. The spice and heat level is moderate. It also serves "Indian Chinese" although there are better places to try this cuisine out. The decor is very plain. There are some pictures of old Singapore that history buffs might like. A bar is also present (although have never tried it) and at least looks well stocked. The service is good. Overall, if you are willing to go with the crowd then not a bad place - value for money certainly

I have been to the same chain in India and this time, I thought to give a try to the same at Singapore. The ambience of the place is nice and if you are with your family or even visiting alone, the place offers a calm and due to heavy air conditioning, somewhat chilling experience. Nice old and new songs from different geners is playing all the time giving you relaxation. The place offers both veg and non veg food. I am a vegetarian so I tried only North Indian veg food. It tastes nice and the portions are also of decent quantity. I have tried so far Deal Makhani, Kadai Paneer. with plain naans and the taste was good. I wouldn't say it was exceptional but it is not far from the authentic taste of the same dishes in Punjab. For me the only issue is the pricin. I found the prices to be on a little high note. You would find a difference of about 2$ in each dish compared to the nearby places. But since the place is clean, calm and the food doesn't tastes bad, it shouldn't be an issue. Overall, I shall say that it's a good place to visit or at least worth trying once.
4
I simply love the chicken Szechuan noodles here. Always dying to have it. The right amount of spice and real taste. Overall food quality is good with a nice ambience as well. The prices are not too exorbitant and the location is right across the famous mustafa mall. So a perfect way to end off a busy day of shopping with a tasty meal.
3
I have been to this place twice, my first experience was better than the recent one. I ordered North Indian food on my first visit which ok not really great. Second time it was time to try indo-chinese and trust me that was very dissatisfying, too much spicy and only flavour you get is tomato sauce
3
Had stopped while shopping for dinner and ordered vegetarian main course of daal makhni and navratan korma. The preparations were not so fine and the portion was also smaller.Service was very slow..However the best part is ambiance and seating.
4
Good service & nice ambiance. Good value for $$$ for mid budget travellers. Food portion looks to be smaller.
4
There are many restaurants in neighbourhood of this place , but looking to its name and relating ot to India Copper Chimney resturant , I entered in .Its nice and clean place . In the chilling Air Conditioned ambience , they play only 60-70s Lata, Rafi , Mukesh songs gives you real Indian feel .The food i ordered was Roti Tokri , Dal Tadka & Tawa Veg .All was servers within reasonable time and the food was equsitely better in taste & quality .Service was quick and pricing was moderate .I shall recommend all who like tastey Indian food , to visit this place 
3
I visted here with my parents after a tiring day for lunch.. Food was good.. but the sad part was service is too slow even there was no other customers.. And also price was bit more.. if you want to try a north indain foods you can try it here
5
Amidst the noise and and confusion of tourists and shoppers in the narrow streets of bustling Little India it is wonderful to discover this cosy restaurant and sit down to a cool drink.. chilled beer is a option. Rest your feet and be prepared to enjoy a great meal. Chinese Indian for a touch of nostalgia or the real deal desi Indian dishes.Wonderful friendly service as well! Thanks
4
When I went to this restaurant I saw the chefs blazing fires cooking the traditional Indian food. The variety on the many was astonishing any thing from Indian fusion to traditional Indian food like tandoori chicken. The desserts were also wonderful 
3
Copper Chimney is a simple but truly original Indian restaurant in Little India. I've been a few times and tried several dishes with friends, from evergreen as byriani or vindaloo to less ordinary dishes. Quality is always ok, as well as quantity: you'll never leave the table feeling hungry! The service is ok, the only bad side is that fresh lime soda tastes much more like Fanta than the real thing I've learnt to love in India!
4
The best Budget Indian restaurant in Little India. Located on main road and good location. Enjoy good north Indian and chinese food with good hositality. Bang opposite Mustafa Center
4
Try their Dhum briyani, great taste. Staff are very friendly and food quality and taste is great. Been there daily either for Lunch or Dinne

Wanted to try some north Indian food, guessed we chanced upon the wrong 'restaurant'. Should have leave the place when no service staff attend to us as we entered e place. Have to get the menu ourself from the billing counter. And when ask for recommendations, the service staff can't give a proper one. One of the dishes we ordered was the Tom yum soup. The soup that was served looked totally different from the one shown on the menu. First off, the colour is wrong(bright solid orange, never have a Tom yum soup of that colour before, picture posted).there's small pieces of white stuff in it which we assumed is the prawns that was shown as a full prawn in the menu. If that's not bad enough, it cost $6.00 and came in a tiny bowl which is smaller than my palm. But think of it, if it come in a normal size bowl it would be a waste, does not taste at all like tom yum more of a soup spiced with lots of pepper n chilli, horrible and we can't finish it. If it had tasted nice, I wouldn't mind paying that price at all. Saw on the menu Steamed white rice, single portion(we checked with the staff), cost $3.50. I dunno what special rice they use, and I'm not going to find out.To sum it up: Keep Ou
