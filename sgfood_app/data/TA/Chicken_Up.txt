Great to place to drop by to cool down or unwind after a commute. Located just at MRT Landing, Chicken up Buangkok offers delicious tasty food! Stay was very attentive to your every need! Thumbs up!

Another one of the franchised Korean Fried Chicken. Chicken Up makes really good fried chicken. I recommend both the Spicy Up Mega Half Chicken and the soba salad. The half chicken is actually 4 chicken pieces fried separately. Meat is tender and skin is crunchy. Be ready for the spicy taste, though it isn't overly spicy. The soba salad should provide the balancer with its lettuce, vinaigrette dressing and cherry tomato slices. Overly, good meal. Don't mind coming back.
