Value for money. Good set lunch packages. Service was also attentive. I would recommend this place for any occasion and purpose.

Great food and service , all ingredients are fresh. Restaurant is so unique . In each every dishes are very creative. It’s worth to spend here.

5 spices Pork rolled noodle soup? Not sure of the name anymore. Noodles so soft! So good! Also the veggie curry!! So good!!

Basically you find it by going through the entrance to the casino then taking a lift up to a mezzanine level of restaurants above the casino floor.Best time to go if you fancy a drink is during their happy hour, if not then wines start at 80 dollars plus 7% plus 10%, so we enjoyed a Singha each at 14 dollars + +.Food was excellent, we skipped starters and had Pad Thai, a veg curry and a duck curry plus rice.The Pad Thai was a meal in itself and the 2 curries were full of fresh flavour.I would have given 5 stars but the duck in the roast duck curry was no more than 2 small pieces on the bone plus a small piece of boneless meat

I’m a regular at Long Chim in Sydney. And the Singapore arm turns out to be just as wondrous. So very familiar and yet it still astonished me. The stir fried baby squid was lovely - electric with green peppers and red chili, yet with plenty of sweet touches, and great complexity. The coconut ice cream is a near perfect dessert!! The whole fried school prawns here are not as good as Sydney’s - probably it’s the quality of the Australian prawns. Nevertheless, I can’t speak too highly of this place.

We visited while staying at the MBS in February. We had a set dinner menu which I received from my wife for xmas.The food was excellent, as were the happy hour drinks that we had. Service was also superb. We would definitely visit again, next time in Singapore

Just like the melbourne version, LC in singapore was a wild trip for the taste buds that delivered across the board. The interiors were beautifully done and the room while loud adds to the fun. I went for the soft shell crab noodles and the minced pork with basil and we split the duck larb. Pad thai is not a dish I'd normally order as you want to try most interesting things at higher end places like this. Haha, my friend could not resist and I got myself a bite and it was quite good. Other than the mall'ish location, there is not much more that I could ever want

So, back in about 1999, I dined at a place in Potts Point by the name of Darley Street Thai. It was nothing short of extraordinary. It’s nearly 20yrs on, and it’s still my favourite Thai restaurant of all time. It awoke something in me. But the restaurant wasn’t to be, not for the usual reasons of ego or overcapitalisation, but because the Australian owner/chef was appointed as head chef for the Royal Court of the King of Thailand. David Thompson had well and truly arrived.I was smitten. I attended 4 of his cooking classes at the Fish Markets at Pyrmont, and then Nahm at the Halkin Hotel in Chelsea. I bought all of his cookbooks, which having heard him so many times, jumped out of the page with his inflection and tone. He taught me how to make coconut milk from coconuts using nothing more than a meat cleaver and a chux. Quite something.And tonight we dine at Long Chim in Singapore, his latest iteration which already has a Michelin star. The menu doesn’t appear to be his usual high end interpretation, which is perhaps surprising when positioned amongst the Celebrity Restaurants of Marina Bay Sands. No miang.We start with spring rolls and chicken satays. But don’t be fooled. The pastry of the spring rolls is so delicate, and the hand chopped sweet and sour sauce so lovely. Nothing pedestrian here. The satays too are so lush and so infused with flavour.The kids pad Thai chicken is exquisite. Comfort food at its finest.Then the green papaya salad. Cut coarsely, the snake beans and papaya are studded with fresh scuds - they pack quite a punch.Then red duck curry. The underlying prawn paste is so rich and smoky and the oiliness of the duck rounds out the flavours. The bitterness of the round baby eggplant are always cool. Then the larb duck salad. Hold onto your hats - or not. The chef has taken a look at us and judged us as not worthy. No sting of scud, but scattered pieces of ordinary dried long red chilli, sans seeds. This has no heat whatsoever. And no real presence of the usual lime. Actually disappointing. The accompaniment of cucumber, shredded cabbage and snake bean is laughable.Something too about cancelling two dishes from the menu because the paste hasn’t arrived from Thailand. That scares me. That reeks of franchise not freshness.We have an Alsace Gewurtztraminer which is just wonderful. Attractive rose on the front palate, mild acidity, but not flabby as they are prone to be.David Thompson - he’s certainly not an attractive man, indeed he’s been likened to a bantam rooster. But I love him. Indeed after Barack Obama and Adam Gilchrist, he’s the only other gentleman I’d turn for . Sadly he was nowhere to be seen tonight

Oh dear. We had such high hopes having loved Long Chim in Perth, but the Singapore version is a very different proposition. The restaurant looks like a Vegas style “authentic Thai” eatery and was basically empty on a busy Saturday evening in buzzing MBS. We started with the happy hour cocktails (weak), ordered a few starters to share (nice fish cakes) and finished with a few shared mains, half of which we didn’t eat. No soul
5
I really like Long Chim, have been a few times over the last couple years and although portions are getting a little smaller & pricier, it's still one of the best value celebrity chef restaurants in Marina Bay Sands. The quality of the food is great, flavours fantastic (my Thai friends validate this) and the staff are very helpful. You can even get a view over the light show :-) Can be tricky to find, you need to be on ground level near the rain Oculous, inside the mall towars Tower 3/East then look for the restaurant concierge to point you towards the lifts.
4
Lovely flavours - authentic and real estaunt home cooked food if that makes sense. Fantastic service with staff that cared. Ambience good and waitress recommendations helped us choose wisely. Exactly what we were looking for.
2
I cannot understand how David Thompson, the authority on Thai food can put his name to this restaurant. My dish of charred noodles consisted of tasteless and reheated chicken . When you’re paying $ 27 for a dish , you don’t expect this crap. Avoid.
4
Top quality, high end, Thai food as you would expect from Thompson.
The menu is excellent though fairly punchy in price, again, as you would expect for the location.
The location itself is peculiar, almost overlooking the casino. Nicely done inside though.
5
Amazing food. Every single menu item was quality brilliant. Particular mention to Fried Seabass, Prawn Pad Thai, Crab fried Rice and absolutely awesome cocktails.
Highly recommend the restaurant!

Before we went to Long Chim, we were told by friends that it was difficult to find the restaurant. We booked a table at 11.30 am and arrived at 11.15 am. One staff was standing behind the counter but he was most unfriendly. He did not allow us to wait inside the restaurant. We had to walk around the place until 11.30 am. At 11.30 am we presented ourselves at Long Chim, a second waiter was there. He was not enthusiastic at all. We had to tell him that we had time constraint and that was why we booked at 11.30 am. He then agreed to take us to our table. The day was saved when this waitress by the name of Wee attended to us. Her service was FIRST CLASS. She served with a genuine smile. She made us feel at home. The food was too salty, too oily and had too much spices. Professional cooks are very sensitive to the taste. May be the head chef was on leave that day. The drink that was on promotion and sold at $10-00 was excellent. The manager in charge of Long Chim should look into service and food quality before we will introduce friends to this place
2
We have eaten at David Thompson restaurant in Sydney many years ago, as well as at his restaurant in Bangkok . We thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and food at the Bangkok restaurant so I made sure to reserve a table many weeks ago. There was so much chilli on all of our dishes that it overtook any other flavours and spices that may have been there. Whereas Bangkok was elegant, the atmosphere here was almost food hall
1
The restaurant is impossible to find without asking for directions, the food is basic Thai that they try so very hard to repackage as 'modern fusion', and the prices are high. Worst of all the staff are hopeless, after complaining to the manager he was more insistent about right he was and how good he was. There are literally so many other quality restaurants to chose from... just give this a miss, trust me
4
I’ll summarize and say the food here is great and I will be coming back for more. We’ve come to have preconceived notions of Thai food; namely tom yum soup. It isn’t on the menu here, but the menu presents familiar dishes with an upward twist. It is a pleasant surprise and I do enjoy it. Wok fried favourites being cooked in the corner of my eye, tantalizing tastebuds as you see a masterchef at his work, the friendly staff who gave us a fantastic table, I enjoyed my experience here.All that being said, the prices are far above what you’re used to paying at other Thai joints. But if you’re willing to explore a different yet authentic Thai journey, I highly recommend you give Long Chim a try
3
The food was tasty and nice, no doubt the chef can cook. Sadly the service failed to deliver the same level of quality. Most service staff exuded disinterest and demotivation. For a restaurant in this location and at this price point, this is simply not good enough. The food can make up for a lot, but not for everything.
4
Had lunch on 1st; thankfully we made reservation. Cos it was crowded. A modern touch to traditional Thai dishes.. Party of 4; we ordered some dishes to share - Masaman beef curry; Kampong chicken green curry; brinjal salad; squid with green peppercorn; Chiangmai chicken. The foods were very good; portions not big but good enough for sharing... Squid was so tender with ink sauce n a zest of peppercorn - 麻辣 flavour. Masaman beef was awesome; with sweet potatoes n peanut - very authentic. Salad dish n Chiangmai chicken as recommended by server did not disappoint. Jasmine rice serving was generous; 2 portions more than enough for 4 pax. Prices are not cheap though for the portion. Sticky rice mango dessert was mediocre; can't beat BKK ones. We paid $150 after using a 30% discount. Overall; Long Chim earned 4 more satisfied customers. A note though; they don't provide complimentary parking coupons. MBS parking rate is known to be stiff
4
I likr the reataurant the atmosphere is quite cozy and welcoming. The foof was fine, however despite I enphazised in no spicy food they served a really hot meal.
5
We started with a couple of cocktails which were creative and very nice. Including a mocktail for my son.
The food was delicious. The mashed prawn curry ridiculously good.
Service friendly, quite fast and knowledgeable.
The decor is fun.
Overall we thoroughly enjoyed Long Chim.
4
This is my second visit to Long Chim and another enjoyable lunch. Tried different dishes this time from the set lunch menu options and they were good. Liked the desserts especially.
2
The servings were very small. The authentic thai food was very spicy and hot. There is not enough light whilst dinning.
Staff very warm and friendly.
1
The food was not good and one dish was terribly overcooked. The concensus at our table was that you can get much better Thai food in Thailand at street stalls, and in Singapore at other Thai restaurants (and for much cheaper too). Some people might like to visit this place for cocktails - the ambience is decent enough, with dim lighting and decor which I believe is meant to evoke a Thai street scene - and there are some Happy Hour deals. Overall, we were not impressed and in fact were quite disappointed, having expected much more because of what we had read about the restaurant, as well as its Michelin star. We would not recommend it, and will not visit again
4
Had the vegetarian set menu. Staff was extremely accommodating as the set menu normally requires minimum of two. Food is tasty but portion is too big despite I am no small eater. Chives cakes had too much sauce making them a bit too salty for my taste. Salad was also too spicy for me although I love the salad as well.
3
Visited for dinner midweek on Wednesday had difficulty finding the restaurant from within the crown center and passed it several times and asked for directions before we found it. Some of the food was good. The prawns in betel leaves, the fish cakes for starters are good choices. Disappointed with the red duck curry as it was very fatty and the duck meat was quite tough. The soft shell crab noodles were ok but the noodles were clumped together and not the best. Still, a nice restaurant for some Thai food, in a great location in southbank. Will try other dishes next tim
3
Ambience is very good. Loved the funky hip deco with no loud music so that we can enjoy food and have a conversation. The mashed prawn curry was good. However i feel portions should be more generous in view of the rather steep prices here. Service was good though
3
The place is in a great tourist location and has good ambiance. The food quantity is ok but taste is poor or it may cater to few people. The soft shell crab dish was a blooper. If the multi course meal the saving grace was soup. Overrated and highly overpriced. If you are looking for good Thai food look elsewhere
5
This Thai restaurant nestled in the Casino area at Marina Bay Sands is really nice and cosy. The dÃ©cor is nice and modern, the view is pretty nice too onto the lights show. The food was absolutely delicious! We loved everything from the crunchy coconut shrimp rolls to the curry and pad thai! Nicely presented and good service as well! They have great drink specials as well with thai beers and nice cocktails
4
Prompt service staff. Very helpful with recommendations. Impressive food. Highlight was the lamb curry. Fresh food and flavorful. We finished without leaving a drop of gravy. Yummy till the last drop.
5
A good night out. Authentic excellent food. Service was informative and thoughtful. Good innovative cocktail selection in theme
3
This is a high-end Thai street food place. The pork skewers as starters were nice but the roast duck red curry was seriously overpriced for the tiny portion. The desserts are ordinary and again overpriced for the small portion. Service was great though.
3
The food was a hit and miss. The soft shell Crab noodles were drenched in lime juice during cooking yet it was served with a huge wedge of lime that we naturally squeezed over our dish. None of the waiters informed us that the noodle were already drenched in lime juice till we gave feedback. The stir fried squid was too far on the bitter side to be fully enjoyed.
4
Since this restaurant is on Mecherran Guide Singapore 2017, I deceide to have lunch with my girlfriends. It is a bit hard to find this place, need to check the mall map in advance. The food was good, especially the eggplant salad. I will go back for just have the salad again

Located on the 2nd floor of MBS, Long Chim boasts a modern and trendy interior with Asian twists, scenes of Bangkok and a view of Marina Bay from certain tables. But the view is a double edged sword because you get plenty of natural light (great!) and some of the heat as well (not so great). Cured Pork Fritters - Deep fried breaded cubes filled with sourish cured pork and an uneven distribution of chilli; best eaten with the peanuts to help neutralise the sourness. No great shakes and not my cup of tea. Miang Prawn - One of my dining companions had the Miang prawn, which was an assortment of ingredients (dried prawns, shallots, peanuts etc) wrapped in a betel leaf. Sweet, spicy and sour all at once - akin to a zesty rojak paste. Can't say this was well received. Fried Rice with Roast Duck - This was my main course and though this dish came across as lightly salty and savoury, it lacked any discernable wok hei. I couldn't quite make out the taste of the duck slices as well, which was a pity. Overall a rather forgettable dish of fried rice.Sweet Mango Sticky Rice - One of the quintessential Thai desserts, the humble mango sticky rice. Mildly sweet mango slices atop rather watery rice (too much creamy coconut milk!) and sprinkled with fried mung bean to inject some crunch. Decent dessert but portion sizes are minute; I finished the whole thing in 2 spoonfuls. Lunch for the 3 of us cost ~ $94, which isn't expensive (ala carte and dinner prices are quite a bit higher though) given the prices at Marina Bay Sands in general but quality is average at best. Overhyped and rather underwhelming in my humble opinion. Service is decent though
4
Located on the Celebrity 2nd Floor at the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes, the entrance to the restaurant is beautifully lighted up with street scene. The well decorated informal interior with an open concept kitchen stood them out against the other Thai restaurant setting. We ordered more than enough to feed just two of us –1. Wagyu on skewers – more like beef satay without the peanut sauce. 2. Baked prawns with glass noodles – very generous 5 big prawns with well-seasoned glass noodles cooked in a steel pot. This dish came last and we were already more than half filled. Nevertheless, we enjoyed this dish the most.3. Cabbages – expensive fried cabbage with special sauce and dried prawns. Cabbage was cut over size to my liking. A little on the oily side as the chef must have fry with big fire to get the wok taste. Dish appearance not so appealing but taste not so bad and very oily!4. Seabass with Thai sauce – expecting whole seabass? Fat hope. It was seabass fillet – 4 to 5 pieces. Crispy fillets were marinated with Thai sweet sauce. Tasted shiok! When we asked the waitress why not a whole seabass, her replied was that the fillet came from a single fish without the head!Overall, we enjoyed our meal in a hip and cool ambience. Be prepared to spend more than S$50/pax on ala carte menu
5
Yesterday we went to this restaurant for lunch. We ordered 4 different combination of set meals .two veg and two nonveg. Starters like spring roll. Eggplant salad were fantastic. Main courses all except thai green curry which was little more salty were very good. Deserts also enjoyed very much. Then the black coffee and tea were superb. At 30 $ per head plus 10$ for cocktail we had a great lunch
5
My husband and I had such a wonderful experience at Long Chim this past weekend! I can't believe it took us this long to find it as it tastes like you are actually in Bangkok! We loved the papaya salad, curry, pad thai, pork satay, and fish. The food was AMAZING- we will definitely be back
3
Don't fall for their marketing hype. Very average representation of Thai street food: you can find better value of same dishes in a food court. Fish cake tasted of red curry and zero fish. Satay was passable. The pad Thai was average and the fried cabbage a total rip- off. Relies heavily on dried shrimps for flavours but no finesse in presentation or taste. Overhyped and over valued. Eat better at a food court
5
Recommended food in MBS. Try getting a window table for a beautiful view. Squid and curry are excellent. Spicy chicken is a great starter. Price to quality ratio is worth it.
5
Decoration of the restaurant is really nice, specially the toilet. Taste of food is good but just too pricey for the portion. The service by staff peter was really gd.
5
Absolutely magnificent flavours, balance and skills highlighted in do delicious food. The cocktails before are excellent, staff are brilliant and the view and ligh5 show on the harbour at 8PM and 9pm is amazing
4
Well presented and very flavoursome Thai food. Special mention to Judy who met us at the front of house and escorted us to our table and also to Peter our waiter for their friendly and attentive service. Overall a great experience.
3
I was really looking forward to lunch with colleagues at Long Chim but I did not enjoy it at all. The amount of salt in and on their food just ruined my meal. We even sent one dish back because it wasn't edible. I was so disappointed. There are better restaurants in Singapore, so give this one a miss
4
Long Chim is a place I’ve wanted to try for a while but after reading a few surprisingly negative reviews on TripAdvisor I was having second thoughts. I decided to try it anyway and I’m glad I did. Some of the people clearly don’t know much about Thai food. We chose the soft shell crab, a chicken curry, Larb and fish cakes with steamed rice. It was all exceptional with beautiful subtle flavours and a perfect amount of heat. I’ve eaten at a lot of Thai restaurants and the spices, flavours and food quality in general were superb. The service was efficient and the food prepared fresh and served quickly. Long Chim is a beautifully appointed, funky looking restaurant with a great vibe. The only aspect which I found tedious was that after asking for water we were poured a $10 bottle of still water. I wanted tap water. For $10 I’m assuming the water was distilled from a spring in a Peruvian rain forest whilst a mermaid was having an orgasm. I also thought alcohol was quite expensive. Otherwise I couldn’t fault anything. The food portions were more than generous
1
We had previously had dinner on a weeknight at Long Chim and found the food impressive and the best Thai food in Singapore. Tonight we just finished dinner and because it's Friday night, there was just not enough cooks and servers in the restaurant. We were given one dish at a time to eat with our rice and by the time the next dish came the rice was cold. The green curry was the worst I have ever had! It was just mush and one could not see the separate ingredients in it. On the other hand the roast duck curry was just as bad and the duck meat was not cooked enough and was just too rough. When I complained, they got the chief chef to redo the green duck curry which was better but still to up to mark. The green pepper corns were not there as it should be in a green curry. So the warning is not to go to Long Chim on the weekends or Friday night or you will be sorely disappointed with the food.I would have rated tonight's dinner 0/5 except that it is possible to do that on TripAdvisor
3
Have visited Long Chim over 10 times and even know the wait staff well. They have a great selection of cocktails and a wide variety of Thai food. Prices are in line with MBS restaurants. Major issue is they put way too much salt on their food. This has been confirmed my my wait staff friends too, other customers have complained about it. However, a good restaurant, just ask for less salt
3
We had been here for dinner briefly before another event, and were impressed by the menu, the decor, view, and service.We brought friends here for a meal, based on the previous experience.Somehow it didn't work: the cocktails were small and weak, then when we got to the table, it was not fully aircon, and it felt like sitting in the mall. The Thai beers are ridiculously expensive (given you know how much they actually cost), and not even draft. But then when we ordered food, we were told items were: too sweet/salty, too hot/spicy, not available, etc. This was on a Saturday night - surely everything would be available in a less than half full restaurant. It's a shame, the restaurant looks good, and the meals sound appetising, but the reality is just not up to par for the location/price/celebrity restaurant label. We went away feeling like we hadn't given our guests the wonderful evening we expected.The food itself was good: spring rolls, fish cakes, wagyu satay, the laab was rejected by even the spice-fiend in the group. Mains, our request for Prin noodles was replaced with another wide noodle, green curry with chicken (no duck), veggies, the fried fish was very nice
3
Visited on a Sunday with a 30% discount voucher. Service is ok except for the manager who deliver food and bill to the wrong table twice.Waiting time for food is pretty lengthy.Food quality is normal and dont order tom yam soup. The only dish that can make it are the rice and noodles.Without discount, dont come
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Everything falls into place here: Good, tasty food. Attentive service (of which there is less these days in Singapore). Nice venue. Good value for money. I can recommend it for both business and private events.
4
Authentic Thai food - modern interpretation but staying true to traditional Thai cooking with authentic ingredients/ spices. The service crew was excellent - attentive, warm and friendly. Interesting modern decor. Together with great service & food, we had a very enjoyable evening at Long Chim and would return for more of Long Chim.
4
I had a business dinner with a set menu which allowed us to try many of the dishes which the restaurant offered. The larb gai (minced chicken salad with herbs and chilis) was a good starter- it had a strong amount of heat and excellent northeast Thai flavors. The crunchy prawns with shallots and Kaffir lime leaves were nice, as were the chive cakes served in a soy garlic chili sauce which was not too spicy. There was also Satay with a mild chili sauce. For the mains we had some glass noodle salad with seafood which was pretty good, with simple flavors. The morning glory was nicely sauteed in the classic style with some chilis. The tofu seaweed soup was very good, a nice simple broth in the background. The tilapia in the salt crust was ok , simple flavors, the fish was a touch on the dry side. The massaman curry of beef was excellent, a rich sauce, tender short rib and sweet potatoes and peanuts- the star dish of the mains. For dessert, some coconut cake and also a fresh combination of coconut milk with jackfruit flavor with pomegranate and coconut slivers. Overall, it was good Thai food, enjoyable flavors and combinations. It was a surprise the restaurant was so empty but with so many choices in Singapore and it being a Tuesday night, perhaps this could explain it
4
My friends and I had lunch at Long Chim on 12/09/17. The food did not disappoint and service staff were helpful and attentive, just like before.However, we had two orders of the famous durian ice cream and they came looking plain. We did not have any sesame wafer on both orders. That took us by surprise. This is an area they must look into to ensure there is consistency in every serving
5
Had a great Thai lunch at very reasonable price.. the freshly deep fried spring roll and the eggplant salad was divine ...roast duck and green chicken curry with bamboo shoots was very yummy.. roast duck was tender and succulent... the dessert was mouth-wateringly good.. had the durian with the Kueh Rose and the mango sticky rice.. definitely will be back❤
4
We had lunch at Long Chim and were served by Brenda who was brilliant. She knew each dish and drink inside and out and was so lovely, polite and kind. Some of the cocktail prices are ridiculous (even though it's Singapore) but there are some good value options as well. There are a number of vegetarian options and not your stock standard Thai dishes. Would recommend a visit to get the Long Chim experience
2
We went in the hopes that this restaurant would be something like David Thompson's restaurant Nam in Bangkok but we were sorely disappointed. Mr. Thompson was clearly far away in actuality and spirit. What we got was pre-prepared food that was warmed over and came far too quickly in an empty peak hour restaurant. We thought this Disney like restaurant would be much better, instead we got a soulless pop music experience with poor service. Do not go, I feel we were tricked into this, no matter, how good the food is, the overwhelming depressing commerciality of Marina Bay Sands smothers the entire experience
5
My wife and I came to Long Chim for a relaxing evening to have delicious food over the weekend and we felt satisfied.The food was simply delicious; and they were some of the most flavorsome Thai dishes we had. We could understand why its flagship restaurant Nahm in Bangkok was ranked so highly. We had the pork skewers and the chives cakes for starters, the special beef curry and cabbage for mains, and finished off with a Thai tea ice cream. The food was packed with different layers of flavors, it elevated Thai food in the right way.The decoration was modern, funky, and vibrant. Checked out the decorations and common area in the toilet, which was interesting.It's not as crowded as I would expect on a Saturday night but could see the potential of it being a popular spot. Further being in Marina Bay Sands would probably gear the place for tourists more than for locals as I felt. Service was friendly and prompt.We enjoyed the experience
3
So, Singapore is not Thailand, but we were longing for some decent Thai food. Long Chim's grilled eggplant salad was amazing, if you are into spicy flavors. The crunchi pork on rice hoisin chili was uneventful. The duran ice cream sesame wafer was excellent and had really intricate flavors that delighted our taste buds. I would not rate the food as overall outstanding, but it was quite good considering that Long Chim is a restaurant in the upscale Marina Sands Mall
5
Master chef led me here. Street food done up & some. Bar dude made me coupla excellent drinks. Went well with the spicy tender fish cakes, warm aromatic chunky green curry. The wagyu beef skewers cld be more seasoned but boy were they tender.Pad Thai had a solid assortment of bits that tied in stunningly once u lime it up.The coconut pudding is highly recommended, bite sized coconut pudding with a sticky just burnt palm sugar sauce over coconut milk - their own twist on salted caramel cake??Well done team david
5
I went here on the most recent weekend and I couldn't speak more highly of the entire experience. The food was outstanding, and the service was exceptional. Probably the best meal I've had in two years in Singapore.
3
Food was generally too salty. Staff did mention this, but then also added it could not be changed, which seemed abit odd
5
The food was good. It retains the culture of the food in the dishes. The service was impeccable. Overall, experience was fantastic. Will go back again!
5
Had a great 50% discount from one of the apps for all items except beverages. The value was great as the food tasted excellent. Ambiance is good

~right above the "Rain Oculus" located somewhere in the center of the Shoppes at MBS. On level 1 to the right of the Mulberry store there's a lift lobby with a Concierge... take that lift up to level 2. the first right is where Long Chim's at~I made a "Chope" reservation for Sat noon but it was very empty, prolly 6 occupied tables in total ~i was late and 15mins past, they did call to check if I'm still coming... nice ~greeter & hostess were friendly but it started to go downhill from getting seated on~our waitress was attentive but impatient ~brunch menu or maa long chim set menu are both with a minimum of 2pax to orderCrunchy Prawns - exactly as described, heads and all, goes well with the half lime servedCrispy Pork - kinda tough but edible Dtom Yam of Snapper with Tumeric - apparently you gotta choose either Fish or Prawn or Seafood... I Asked for seafood and this is not Tom Yum soup not even close Thin Rice Noodle - omg with lime this dish only tasted of lime... stopped after 2 bites~when we told the waitress about our food she gave us a 15% but after I got back I see we'd been charged for 2 soups to the tune of $27 Dtom Yam Hang & $32 Tom Yum Seafood which wasn't on the menu... I think we were served Tom Yum ~ Thin Rice Noodle $27 was not charged but bottomline we were served only 1 soup won't be back and definitely do not recommend
4
If you need to entertain and the guest asks for Thai, then this is probably the place to go. Well executed dishes and a wonderful ambience in the place. Wait staff attentive and unobstrutive. Pad Thai, roast pork, papaya salad all great. Oddly enough, it was rather quiet, less than 30% of the tables were occupied. But then I was there at 8-ish and in Asia, dinner is earlier. Definitely worth a visit if you have a hankering for posh Thai
4
Nice ambience - Stylish yet tries to replicate street food in Thailand. Crunchy prawns and skewers of meat were delicious. Some dishes were a little too salty and too spicy even though I like my food salty and spicy. The best part of the meal was the durian ice cream- smooth, fragrant and rich with a unique cracker. The coconut cake was a tad dry and tasteless. Service was attentive.
5
we were lucky david thompson was around during our visit! ambiance is cool. food wise- slightly on the salty side especially the soft shell crabs . the curries are exceptional. taste similar to what ive tasted in the countryside of thailand . what took my breath away is the durian ice cream. its just heavenly! price also not too bad. its a misconception that since its in mbs it should be expensive.but its not. worth coming back again!!!
3
We went to this restaurant with 4 of us. The view of the bay was lovely. The cocktails were very good. The food was ok. I live in a city with lots of Thai food, so I would say I am fairly picky. The dishes were good, but not great. The atmosphere was fine, fairly casual
2
Partner and I went to Ling chim over the weekend, this was our second visit , we were not too happy the first time but decided to give it a second try based on Chope's recommendation. It offers Thai street food, and absolutely authentic I must say as it was very oily and gave me a stomach ache afterwards. The positive was the efficient service , servers explained what the dish was and we were told coconut oil is used for all cooking. They had a vegetarian menu , which is something that most restaurants are adopting these days. This place is for true street food afficianados
1
Such a disappointment. Restaurant was empty but service was terrible. Food was very uninspiring. 3/10
5
Really good Thai food in a beautiful ambience. I would definitely bring guests from out of town here for a different experience.
2
Food was underwhelming and my wife had stomach ache / diarrhoea later in the evening after our dinner.

We always enjoy going here but cannot understand why the Chef refused to make us nam Chim Seafood when it's the easiest street food sauce to make ! The manager came to our table and said 'Sorry, the Chef will only make it fresh for grilled fish ' I said , 'But we are having grilled prawns and soft shell crab ??!' She went back to the kitchen and the Chef agreed ! I didn't want to ruin our dinner but I was disappointed about the Chef refusing at first ! If you go to any Thai restaurant or street food place , they will happily make it for you. I don't need to mention the price I am paying for dinner ?! Come on ? Whip up some sauce to go with a 30$ plus entree !Food is good and servers are friendly

Went for business dinner. Was expecting really good Thai food based on the publicity. But it was quite average. A little too spicy (but that could be me) so the more complex flavours were lost. Service was average. It is in the sands mall and your table is on a mezzanine overlooking the shops so ambience not great. Washrooms super cool best I have ever found in a restaurant but that's not really why you go...

$30++ for a 3 course ($25 for 2 course) set lunch with a beverage from a celebrity restaurant - wow! The set lunch menu offers many selections (see pix). I didn't quite like the beef sewers as it seemed to have a lot of Indian spice and gamey. My main course of stir fried glass noodles with cured pork squid and dried shrimps was beautifully done. Very flavourful but a little on the salty side as expected from the cured pork. Love the texture of the glass noodles. I opted for durian with sesame wafer for dessert. It would be perfect if it was less. Setting of the restaurant is really beautiful. I am sure it will be even more beautiful in the evening. A great place to come to unwind and chat with selections of $10 cocktails offered during happy hours 12-8pm

We've been to David Thompson's restaurants in Sydney, London, Bangkok and now in Singapore. Still yet to do the ones in Western Australia and Victoria. I've seen a number of posts suggesting that the food at Long Chim in Singapore was bland. Now I don't know if the restaurant had an off night, or perhaps the writers didn't follow the 'spiciness' guide on the menu, but the flavour of the food we had a Long Chim was amongst some of the best we have ever tried, and we have eaten a lot of Asian food in our travels. The meals were spicy, and in some cases quite hot, but in all respects utterly delicious. We had the Roast Duck on Rice, Nongs Long Eggplant, the Sea Bass and the seriously spicy Chiang Mai Larp of Chicken. I thoroughly enjoyed each dish, the duck was cooked to perfection, the eggplant equally so (we love our eggplant!) and the fish was succulent and tender. The Larp proved a bit of a challenge for some at the table. The menu did point out that this dish was at the spicier end of the possible selections :-) I loved it, the heat balanced with some incredible spiciness and a taste that lingered. Went down very well with a Tiger beer. Long Chim is at the pricier end of Thai restaurants, however, the ingredients are of the highest quality and the meals incredibly well put together. The atmosphere I'd describe as 'hawker chic' :-) low light with a bit of an 'opium den' glow about the space. The staff were friendly, welcoming and knew their menu. We thoroughly enjoyed this evening. Thoroughly recommended

Although the restaurant is really beautiful and I love Thai food, this was not mind blowing. Everything tasted really good but there was nothing that would make me go "wow"! Well except for the durian ice-cream: that was an experience. I've never dared to try out the durian fruit and was therefore super excited to find the ice-cream on the menu. Great idea: as it is cold, it does not smell - but you get a good hint of the flavour - and it really tastes nice. Is it worth going ? ... if you combine it with a nice walk at the water front yes
5
Finally got to go over the weekend to must say it was too long in coming. My expectations were not high given the wide range of options for good Thai food however I was ppleasantly surprised at the quality, the services and the atmosphere - and it was not as expensive as we first expected.We started with a cocktail - the Thai style bloody mary is definitely worth a try. We shared dishes and there among 7 people and therewas nothing that was not appreciated. Stand outs were the Waygu beef salad, sour orange snakehead fish curry, fried rich with crab meat. We finished with the banana roti which worked well.Services was good, friendly and helpful, wine list was acceptable both in range and price.Definitely going back and would highly recommend
5
One cannot expect much for a $25 for 2 Course or $30 for 3 course lunch at such a beautiful place. However, my 2 friends and I were pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. You definitely have to try the durian ice cream, although a tad too sweet for me but still one of the best. Whether you order 2 or 3 course, you can have your coffee or tea to wrap up the meal and mind you, other than the usual brewed coffee, you can have cappuccino, latte or thai milk tea too. A keepe

Ambience is nice and cosy. The view of singapore skyline ist fantatise.... however food is too salty
4
The food is good, but I question MBS as the venue. It's the wrong vibe - the Perth venue is far better.
5
Nice cocktail and very attentive staff. The happy hour cocktail price is very good . Nice environment
5
David Thompson "Street food" is michelin star chef quality in a funky beautiful restaurant with the spiciest Bloody Mary's I have Ever tasted!
5
food is quite decent ,,better then non veg selection
thai Green coconut curry was good ..full of flavour ..
But we had enjoy all the veg starter more then a main course
2
Setting is on very non-comfortable chairs. Very nice and friendly people, but food in my opinion below Thai standard quality, although we left it up to the restaurant to provide us with their best dishes of their own choice, while no limit given on budget.Not possible to pay with standard credit cards..

Over 20 years ago I was a regular and Mr Thompson's Darley Street Thai in Sydney. I even did a David Thompson cooking course once so I'm sorry to say that Long Chim is a disaster.Believing things could only get better, I've given Long Chim a go three times now but after last night's visit I won't be back. I made the mistake of taking a major client and his wife there and both the food and the service were an absolute embarrassment.The Thai dishes are either so hot that you can't taste anything or downright awful. Meanwhile the service staff seem to mill around doing nothing in particular.I wish I could be more positive. I just don't know how Mr Thompson can lend his brand to this travesty

Stunningly classy Thai Restaurant at Marina Bay Sands serves astonishingly tasty fare with 'subtlety of taste' making its mark. Sunday night we tried the Vegetarian Set menu. The Starters really got our tastebuds aroused with Veg Spring Rolls, Papaya Salad leading the way. The Main Course was equally mouth watering with beancurd celery broth with Thai rice, aromatic cauliflower & eggplant being outstanding! The drink I chose was Malli Malli, tasted real unique with jasmine flowers for company. Dessert consisted of exotic pistachio coconut ice cream aromatically flavoured. The ambience was cool with dim lighting & interiors tastefully done up Bangkok street style. Just the place to visit for a high-end Thai fare in Singapore
4
Long chim had a variety of vegeterian options so i could choose from alot of foods. I had a rice noodles with chinese broccoli which was very delicious, I wanted some spice so i asked if they could make it spicy and they had no problem making it spicy for me. I enjoyed going to long chim
5
Upon arrival in Singapore, my nephew took me to Long Chim in the Marina Bay Sands complex for dinner. We had the most scrumptious Thai dishes, mostly seafood and vegetables, all of them memorable and prepared on order. The cooks were also very accommodating regarding my allergy to garlic. Service was also great. It was the best Thai food I have ever tasted, some very spicy, some delicate and absolutely delicious. The small calamari dish has been added to my list of “best of.”Long Chim is a lovely place to unwind and chat
2
Granted it was songkran festival.However screaming children firing water pistols wasn't quite the same as long chim in Perth.
5
My favourite restaurant in town! You can see that David Thompson has done some serious research for this restaurant. The food is spicy and intense, but all in all it works very well!
4
Unexpected Thai food.
Very strong and tasty flavours.
Not the usual Thai food you find on the streets of bangkok
5
After Nahm in Bangkok, I couldn't wait to try this offshoot of the David Thompson franchise and it did not disappoint. With the exception of the papaya salad which was relatively unremarkable, each dish we had was a flavor bomb. The grillef mackerel with herbs was unexpectedly outstanding (got it on our waitress' rec) and with the noodles and caramelised peanut sauce, was an explosion of flavors. Would return to try more dishes on the menu. They do a good job of replicating Thai food flavors reminiscent of Bangkok but which are missing in other Thai restaurants here
5
My husband and I were staying at Marina Bay Sands for three days and I booked here for dinner on our second night. I booked a few months in advance to be able to guarantee a table. It was absolutely worth it! Food was delicious as well as the cocktails (happy hour from 5pm-8pm) and dessert. Staff were fantastic and the food itself was full of flavour without the need to add salt and pepper to season. Portions were excellent and the atmosphere in the restaurant was fab. Would absolutely return when we're next in Singapore. We spent $190 which included a starter each, main each, a shared dessert, 2 cocktails, a beer and a large glass of wine. Worth every penny and absolutely deserves its Michelin star.

We enjoyed a nice meal at Long Chim on Saturday night. It probably isn't worth the hype that friends had made about it but it's good food, good service and excellent cocktails. The decor is funky Asian with a bit of a dining-hall feel. The food is generally for sharing and very tasty. The green mango salad had a nice kick to it and the red curry was lovely. They do a "cocktail happy hour" until 8pm and the selection include brilliant, tropical twists on some old favourites. One last point was booking....something they recommend; however as we booked late, we were told they had nothing available. Then we explained we couldn't do anything later as we had a show to attend....and suddenly, they had a table for us. Considering the place was half empty when we arrived and left, I can only assume this was a communication breakdown....so if you if you're unlucky on the first try, press them again!
2
We had high expectations of this restaurant because of its renowned chef and looked forward to an enjoyable dinner.The troubles started with our not being able to find the place.... several persons whom we asked for directions sent us on a wild goose chase and it took us nearly half an hour before we found the restaurant. The place itself was quite large but dimly lit at nighttime , looked desolate and had a few patrons.This should have been a warning sign.We decided to have the set menu for S$ 69 per person so as to sample several dishes. The starters of fish (yellowtail) was inedible as it was chewy and spongy in texture. The pork skewers were average , as were the rest of the dishes.Initially, the waiters were rushing the food, with one mains brought to the table whilst we were still on the starters. We had to request them to pace out the food, which to their credit they obeyed.The mains had a blindingly hot chicken curry which burnt the mouth and it was only the excellent tea leaf ice cream dessert that helped cool things down.The crab dish in the mains was soggy and tasteless.The staff was attentive and courteous but seemed lost and forlorn in the huge area, with no clients. Our table was near an open window area and we felt the lack of air conditioning made it slightly uncomfortable for eating.Perhaps we caught the restaurant on an off day but to us, who were looking forward to a great meal, it was of no consolation.We would not recommend this place, especially with a large selection of other fine eating establishments within easy walking distance

I ate dinner late one evening at Long Chim in Singapore's Marina Bay Sands Shoppes. I fancied some Thai food and Long Chim looked promising... However the food I had was quite average. The Crispy Prawn Cakes I had to start were just chunks of crispy, greasy, fishy batter and rather unpleasant. The Chicken Green Curry I had for my main was pretty tasty but was quite a small portion and the rice was possibly the worse rice I've ever had, dried out and crunchy! Service was okay and cost was average to high, with my food costing SG$45 (about GBÂ£30). What really upset me though was the fact that the 3 couples, with all their children and 3 nannies, that were sat on a long table next to me were basically treating the restaurant like a playschool and the management did nothing about it. I have children myself and am all for families eating out together, but letting your children run around the restaurant and even sit at other tables and put the glasses up to their mouths and put their hands in the dishes is totally unacceptable. Management were aware what was happening but choose not to talk to the parents which to me was the wrong decision when the rampaging kids were obviously spoiling the meals of other diners. I would not visit Long Chim again and would not recommend it either

David Thompson continues to deliver very good quality, non mainstream Thai dishes. The menu is not large, which gives the chefs time to concentrate on getting things right. It was unfortunate that on our night, the two main courses we had been looking forward to fit weeks were not available. Our second choices, Pork Fritters, Roast Duck, and Green Curry of Beef were very good and of a good size. Served in a professional and efficient manner, with a glass of wine and two beers our bill was $140. Not cheap, but a great experience.Recommende
4
The place was lovely and the staff was friendly and helpful. We ordered the set menu (3 course = S$38++). Ordered the cured pork and vegetable spring rolls (appetizers), green curry chicken and chiang mai curry noodles (mains) and thai coffee and thai tea ice cream (dessert). The cured pork was alright although the green curry chicken was a tad too salty for my liking. The ice cream was refreshing. Overall had a good experience here.
4
Meal is nice and service was great. Seasoning is a little bit heavy for our taste but in a delicious way. Signature drink recommended.
4
Great authentic Thai food (not usual SG version). Good service, great food and a good experience.
Restaurant itself a little 'barn like' and not intimate for a romantic mean but food very good.
3
Service staff seems to be rushing to clear our plates when we are still not done.
This happened twice during the course of our dinner.
Disappointing
5
If you wanna go to Bangkok for having Thai food. This place is the answer.
Som Tum (papaya salad) is recommended.
2
I have been to Long Chim before and the fried beef noodles was a lot better last time. This time is was just burnt and hard to eat. Like eating charcoal
5
Great food and service. Staff are attentive and helpful. Good atmosphere for friends, family and couples.
5
First time trying the food at this cosy restaurant and I would say the food is really good! Staff is very friendly and helpful with assisting on choice of dishes! Lovely the durian ice cream, taste like real durian!
5
Great place to chill out with friends for a casual lunch. Service staff is attentive without being intrusive. Strongly recommend!
4
The atmosphere and decor are fantastic. One of the best I have seen for a Thai restaurant in Singapore. Feels like u r on a street off Bangkok. The children's menu is a complete value for money. The other food is a hit or miss. Guess it is what you order. Feels the meats could have been more flavourful. They did not capture the distinct Flavours from the dishes. themselves, which were very flavourful. Drinks were distinct and really captured the Thai Essence.
2
Fancy place with good service. The problem was their food that was below average. We had squids and chicken with holy basil. None of them were good. If you look for good and tasty food, go to one of the food courts instead. Cheaper (here its 9 $ for a water bottle) and far better food. Like Maxwell. If you think fancy surroundings is more important, this place is great for you
5
Celebrated a close friends birthday here and throughly enjoyed the weekday set lunch. The waitress was extremely friendly and went through the menu and provided us with wonderful recommendations based on our preferences. Will definitely return.
4
Food was good and different flavours! Enjoyed the prin noodles and grilled food. Drinks before 8pm are 10$!
4
The food is very tasty with interesting mix of spices and sauces. However, I find the service level is just 3-star rating - not friendly and lack of knowledge of the dishes. Just a simple question of recommendation - cannot pass... I will go back because of the food though..
5
This was our second trup back to Chope. Initially we'd gone in April 2016 and I'm embarrassed to say found the food too spicy (embarrased as we thought we were appropriately chilli trained). Thsi meant that we didn't fully enjoy the meal. Second time back however, we probably rodered more wisely. And were rewarded with fabulous Thai food with a modern twist in many cases. We had mentioned our first experience to the waiter, who guided us through the menu with some alternative dishes that we should try. All in all a great experience and we'll be going back
3
The menu selection is pretty decent but i find that everything was overly tasty to the point of exaggeration. Obviously it was a pricey restaurant seeing that it's in MBS Celebrity Chef circle, but you can definitely get by with cheaper better options elsewhere. Otherwise, the place is very cosy and service is good. It was very empty tho, so I wouldn't expect service to be any less than that
4
We were in the are and decided to visit the place for lunch. Surprisingly it was not crowded. Just a couple of tables occupied. So we had our choice of table which was one overlooking the waterfront with natural lighting. After looking through the menu, we decided on the 3-course lunch set (S$30++) which includes a choice of soft or tea/coffee. We had iced thai milk tea and iced tea with lime, which were rich and not too sweet.Chives CakesThe cakes looked and tasted like the teochew style ku chai kueh 韭菜粿 (chives steamed rice cake). The version here had pan fried to give it a crispy crust. Felt that the skin was tab too thick. Wish that there was sambal chilli sauce to go with it.Cured Pork FrittersLight and crispy on the outside, but the filling was too little to make an impression.Kanom Jin Noodle served with Mash Prawn CurryThe prawn was minced quite finely. Although the sauce tasted more on the sour side, but one soon got used to it. Served with raw greens such as bean sprouts, long beans, cucumber, and mints.Chicken Biryani Thai Style with Tomato & Herb SoupSurprisely the dish did not use the long grain rice which was usually found in biryani in Singapore. The rice was flavourful and went quite well with the sweet tomato sauce. The chicken loooked dry and charred but was quite tender.Mango and Sweet Sticky RiceThe rice was soft and chewy, although it was be better had it been served hot. Topped with the juicy sweet mango and crispy crunchy mung beans.Durian Ice Cream with Sesame WaferThe sesame wafer looked like the Beehive Cookies (Kuih Rose) 蜂窝饼 which was usually available during festive season. It was light and crispy, which gave a savoury taste when accompanying the rich and creamy durian ice cream.Overall the food was great and the place was quite relaxing to be around
5
Had dinner here with our friends from London. Restaurant layout was cosy and classy. Menu was not comprehensive but definitely of quality. The Baked Prawns with Glass Noodle is a must try. Their Thai Milk Tea was smooth and not overly sweet. Seabass was nice too as they used only the fillet and that means it's boneless.We were served by Peter and he was simply amazing. All dishes were recommended by him and he was so attentive to us.Definitely coming back
3
We went at 10pm on a Saturday night and unfortunately a couple of dishes we wanted to try were not even available. The dishes that did come were definitely above average except for the veg spring rolls. Also service was an issue as it was hard to find a waiter
4
We were shopping at Marina Sands & saw Long Chim & having experienced Perth's restaurant we thought we would try Singapores . It's located on level 2 dining overlooking the casino in the Marina Sands mall. Loved the interior & ambience of the restaurant. The painted tiles & wooden furniture created a very cool room for dining. We enjoyed a few tapas which was extremely tasty . The staff were also friendly & knowledgeable giving us excellent detailed information about the dishes. Overall - a little pricey but cool trendy interior with tasty food.
5
We ate at Long Chim at the end of November for Sunday Brunch after reading a review of the brunch on the HoneyCombers website. Unfortunately upon arriving we noticed the brunch special offer was different from the offer advertised on HoneyCombers - this was not the fault of Long Chim but still a little disappointing. The Long Chim staff were exceptional helpful and accommodating and allowed us to swap out a dish from the new set menu we didn't like, and even treated us to a free appetizer and dessert to apologize for the understanding. The food itself was amazing, some of the best Thai food I've eaten and we will definitely be going back
4
Like the food.. has character.. and the cocktails were really interesting but they tasted really good.. will definitely come again
5
Lovely food , a burst of flavours that is unforgetable. Also would like to commend the great service from the staff. They have a wide range of gluten free options . Would definitely come back again .
5
Excellent meal, great cocktails and some very attentive service...all for SGD130!!! And it's in MBS with some great views! What's not to love!!!
3
I did not like the food here. I regularly love Thai food, and have been to Thailand several times. I spent $65SG for a lousy dinner. The reason I gave an average review was the very friendly wait staff who were very helpful and responsive.
3
Lovely interior with great views, but tucked away in a hidden corner of MBS. Superb service: with a helpful friendly host. Food was good. Overall experience was good but pricey given the effort the restaurant makes to look like an everyday, informal place to go and eat
4
Was brought here by vendors for a work dinner with some other colleagues. Most of the dishes were spicy but some had the extra kick and a slow burn that can be tongue numbing. I do not drink (alcoholic beverages) but I heard that the drink list was not too impressive though. Desert was good but they were out of their star dish, the Mango and Rice but I think we tried most of the rest. If budget and spice is not an issue, this is one restaurant to try out
5
Wanted to try out thai fusion concept, and I must say, Long Chim have blended it altogether very well. Had 2 dishes with fragrant thai rice, which was already good enough to be eaten on its own. The curry roasted duck was interesting, first time I have even heard of it. The roasted pork with chinese broccoli, which is basically KaiLan, is slightly salty, but went well with the rice.I also tried the iced thai milk tea. At $10 a glass, I was slightly hesitant, but did not regret my order. It was a well made thai milk tea, not too sweet with great tea taste.We went for lunch, and it was mostly empty, so we were ushered to a seat which faced the beautiful Singapore skyline. The restaurant is located right above the Hermes shop, and a only handful of tables will get the marvelous view
5
I went to Long Chim with a group of friends for a celebratory brunch and were not disappointed. The food was very sumptuous and plentiful. The dried prawn ginger toasted coconut was a tad too spicy. But that didn't put us off at all. Though we would recommend you inform the waiter to reduce the spiciness when ordering. The grilled lamb ribs was just divine! Also, the cocktails are not to be missed. Interesting favors and very well blended. We only wished we had more space to eat it all
1
Had a very dissatisfactory lunch at this restaurant the place was practically empty and stayed that way the whole time we were there. We ordered the "snacks" all very average including the prawn fritter that was just some whole fairly tasteless prawns in batter pretty disgusting batter..Disappointed with the Thai food I had a duck rice that was ok,, bit dry and my friend had a pad Thai that was very salty and oily..Very sad as I had hug him expectations would never return
4
Went for dinner with office colleagues. Had veg meal of spring rolls, papaya salad, Thai curry rice and noodles. Also had a palm sugar dessert which was unique and tasty. Overall a good meal. But on the expensive side. The service was bit patchy...my cocktail came after main course was served
4
This is billed as Thai street food. If this is what street food is like in Thailand it is a wonder anyone cooks. The food is absolutely outstanding. Each spice and ingredient announces itself separately to the taste buds and then combines in concert to deliver a truly memorable experience. While not cheap, this food is worth every penny
2
I was really looking forward to eating here being an avid Thai food lover but was truly disappointed. 3 of the dishes we had were really salty and left that 'salty feeling' lingering in your mouth thereafter. Another 1 dish was also on the salty side
3
It is hard to find good Thai restaurant in Singapore and I am always curious about the Long Chim by David Thomson. Read some reviews both food and bad so decided to try myself. The restaurant looks inviting with fun deco that looks authentic like a up market thai food street with a touch of class. The view overlooking the Marina bay is the reason why the food has to be expensive. Ordered a Cocktail which taste like a sour orange juice, way below the cocktail I can have in several restaurants in Bangkok. Starter was the deep fried spring roll, 5 tiny ones for S$18 that taste more or less like frozen mini spring rolls one can get from the super market. First main course to arrive is the Phad Thai S$30, above average in taste. Well cooked and tasty. It followed by the Thai Green Curry with Chicken. The colour look more yellow than green. The taste is disappointing which lack the sweetness and fragrance of good green curry. Not sure if it is intended to be a fusion green curry. Even so, it does not taste good being in a famous restaurant. Overall, I did not get the satisfaction I seek for Thai curry
3
My family and I went for dinner and were rather disappointed. I must say overwhelmingly, the main issue was indifferent, bordering on quite disinterested service. The food was generally good, but beef Mussaman serving was small and a little too sweet. Other dishes were good, including a salt crusted fish, however only a small amount of sauce accompanied a whole fish. Durian ice-cream was very good.Overall, we were underwhelmed and particularly unimpressed with the service. The restaurant was only about one quarter full at peak time on a Tuesday night. I think this is in contrast to some other celebrity chef's restaurants at this time. I am sorry to say I could not recommend this restaurant to anyone was looking to spend good money for a quality dining experience
1
We ordered the beef skewers, pad thai, braised pork and red curry with duck. Everything is too salty except for the pork. This is not authentic Thai food. Prices are very expensive for the quality and quantity of food. Don't go unless you only care about the interior decor and not the food
3
It's a very nice restaurant, with good ambience and attentive staff. The food was nice, however my partner did get food poisoning after eating here... Not sure I'd rush to go back and I'd assume it was a one off thing but still put a downer on what was a nice meal
4
Everything was flavorful, although price tag a little high and service a little clueless (almost got double charged for another red wine and another beer). Went with 2 colleagues where everyone are foodies but everyone loved the food from starter to the dessert. I will be back
5
This restaurant has a very nice interior design. The food is awesome and very delicious. Even though it can be very spicy which I love. The soup may have some chicken claws as it is original Thai, but therefore tastes very good. The desert baked banana is a treat. So enjoy who ever thinks of going there it is worth the time and money.
3
Food was average. The wagyu beef skewer was very good but very salty. The minced beef basil was too spicy. However, the dessert, which was black glutinous rice with padanus noodles and durian ice cream was excellent. We were given a table with a view of the bay. So ambience was very nice.
4
David Thompson Thai we looked forward to this meal as we loved Nahm in Bankok and in London before it closed and this in a restaurant hailed as even more innovative. Sadly A big disappointment. We tried the set menu for 70$ and added a dish or two for our group of six.Very hot and spicy and we usually like spice but too much for us and a couple fo dishes too hot for our Laos family who like it really really hot. Designed as a fusion menu it was disappointing in creativity, presentation ordinary and flavour uninspiring. We didn't have any dish that would tempt us back. Hope Sydney is better. For the traditionalists it has Chicken feet
4
Authentic Thai food, especially the Tom Yum soup and Korat noodles. Contemporary atmosphere. Just brings you back to Bangkok!
4
It was a special moment for us to gathering. Ppl is friendly, helpful and alertness to help us hiding the secret surprise.
2
The food is average at best - though set meal price is reduced, but still over priced. Desserts ( durian ice-cream) is the only good item tastes.
2
Had the set lunch of beef skewers (satay). appetizer and the minced beef and egg rice. The beef skewers had fairly good flavor but were very tough. But the big fail was the fish dipping sauce that was way too salty-sour being almost pure fish sauce. I added a lot of sugar to mitigate but to no avail. Had to eat the skewers plain. The minced beef egg rice was terrible. Beef was way, way over salty that I almost fell off my chair at the first bite. And when it sinks in after a few mouthfuls, it's way too spicy. Burning. Didn't enjoy the meal. A tragedy given how good and enjoyable chef David Thompson's Nahm in Bangkok is. I think he needs to find and appoint better executive chefs in his satellite restaurants. I won't return to Long Chim anytime soon.
4
If you enjoy true blue thai food that is well executed and infused with traditional Thai spices, this is the place for you. Definitely not for the faint-hearted as the spiciness is off the roof for the many dishes we have tried. Most impressively, you will find a lot of traditional roadside thai food (such as chive cake, grilled pork neck and more) that can be rare finds in local Thai restaurants. Go for the Sunday brunch if you wish to have a hearty meal in a group as it is reasonably priced at $60++. The rustic interior in Long Chim is very different from Nahm, another David Thompson restaurant located in Bangkok, which is more high end in a fine dining setting. Overall atmosphere in Long Chim is suitable for family and friend gatherings.
3
The three of us ordered five dishes and two desserts. most dishes come in small portions except grilled tilapia with salt crust, baked prawn with glass noddles and Tom Yum. What we really liked - tilapia as main and banana roti as dessertWhat we think is average - tom yumWhat we don't like - kailan with crispy pork (too oily) and Chendol as dessert What we hated - red curry with chicken (too sweet and dry) and baked prawns with glass noodles (way over-seasoned)I came here twice and I liked the first time better when I ordered Chiangmai curry noodles (Kao Soi) and Thai Briyani. This time the bill came out to be $240 so average $80 per person. I would have gone for the Thai food elsewhere with this price. The seasoning is over powering - we find dishes too sweet, too spicy, too salty and too oily. I am not surprised most diners are either caucasians or non-Thai tourists.
2
The starter wagyu skewers were good but too salty, tom yum got too much lime within and turned out very salty after ten minutes. The phad Thai was good but a little bit too sweet, and overall everyone found the green curry of chicken with little content. At or below this price, there are many other great Thai food stores around, will not recommend to friends
4
There has been a lot of money spent on the decor of the restaurant. Chef famous. Food good but not exceptional. Excellent wait staff. A bit hard to find. Located on the second floor of Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. Transport to and from the centre is pretty well always a pain at peak times
3
Went to Long Chim to celebrate a friend's birthday together with 6 adults. The ambience is nice but a bit too dim - so much so we had trouble reading the menu. Not sure if it was because we were in the middle of the restaurant and there was no light above the table. The food is supposed to be Thai but the decor was more Peranakan. There were two large open kitchens which were great for curious kids but which meant your hair and clothes smelled after dinner. This was aggravated by the heat in the restaurant - a combination of the open concept kitchens, open door and low AC power I guess. While the food was really good, the portions were very small and they were pricey. A lot of the food was salty (probably due to the sauce) and they actually tell you when you order! Wonder if that's supposed to be an unique thing? For the price we pay, we would likely be heading to somewhere else.
5
First things first, I can never not start the review with the description of the design. From the graffiti-like streets of Bangkok at the restaurant's entrance to the open kitchen, the interior design throughout is sleek and hip just as the city itself. We were taken to our table and the waitress was very excited on recommending us their dishes with great consideration of our preferences. So the first dish came: papaya salad and tom yum and that's where we all started crying. It was so delicious, but so spicy that you better not stop eating. Surprisingly, the flavors were still there and weren't overpowered by the amount of chilies. Stir fried glass noodles with pork and squid, and wagyu beef starter are also perfect for sharing. However, the best thing that we had that night was the red curry of Kampong chicken - a very spicy dish, yet bursting with the aroma of peppercorns and basil. Good thing we ordered cocktails and lots of water. To summarize, Long Chim is an upscale Thai street food restaurant worth trying if you are looking for something authentic with a modern twist. More recommended for those who have a good spicy food tolerance.

Went for lunch and took the weekend brunch - mixed reviews from the group!! Starters very Chilli hot- works for some. Mains. Good Tom yam soup/excellent ribs.
Overall enjoyed.

Had a great time there. All the recommendations were spot on. David Thompson is a great chef and this new adventure confirm that. Do not hesitate and go! You won´t regret it!

We went here on our first night in Singapore and we were not disappointed. We didnt have a reservation but we didnt require one as most of the place was empty when we arrived. We were shown our table and the service was exceptional, we were even offered a free glass of champagne each after we had mentioned that we were there for our honeymoon. The food was amazing. Me and my wife thoroughly enjoyed the food at Long Chim, and I would recommend this place to all Thai food lovers. It is quite expensive, but you expect that when you go to a celebrity chef restaurant.My only disappointment were the cocktails we had ordered, both of them were a letdown in terms of the tastes. Maybe we had ordered the wrong cocktails but I would recommend sticking to normal drinks especially as each cocktail was $25.Overall food and service was great and we had a good experience
3
Familiar Thai dishes and wait staff were prompt in taking our orders but not attentive enough for an establishment of this standard.Mains came out well before the starters came out which perplexed me slightly. Food wise. Whilst I appreciate the classic thai dishes and prefer it that way, flavour wise, it was lacking
4
I rushed to try Long Chim when it first opened but it was not an exceptional experience. I found the balance of flavours not quite right as the use of chillies was just too overpowering & the salt level needed dialing down. Somehow when you eat street food in Thailand everything seemed in synch. The restaurant seems to have found its footing when I returned for lunch recently. Although it serves street food, the ambience is anything but. There is a smart selection of cocktails to start off the meal. For lunch there were set meals which were exceptional value. I went a la carte & had stir fried minced beef with chilli & basil. Served with a fried egg atop some steamed white rice, this is the essence of Thai street food. This time round I also ordered a red duck curry & deep fried sea bass with a tangy tamarind sauce. I very much enjoyed my meal but the a la carte prices would induce a heart attack. SGD 45 for the sea bass alone. This would be a place where you would opt for the set menus if you were not on an expense account. Do go if you have the chance and lunch is by far the better deal.
4
Food was great. Was disappointed that they did not actually have one of the dishes on the menu that I was looking forward to trying. Frustratingly the waiter kept on trying to get us to order more food by telling us we did not have enough. What we did order was half what the waiter told us to order and a fair amount of it was uneaten as the dishes are quite large and filling.
3
I've been wanting to try Long Chim for a while—Thai food is one of my favourites and the concept of Thai street food in a plush restaurant was enticing. The space is very pleasant - large, open, nice decor—though it can be hard to find in the maze of Marina Bay Sands (better ask a concierge). I was mildly disappointed with the food. That said, there were enough delectable sounding dishes on the menu that we didn't get to try for me to give it another shot. The duck in red curry was chewy though the gravy was yum; and I didn't much care for the eggplant with shrimp salad that was seedy (llterally not figuratively) and sounded nicer on the menu than it tasted. We were almost blown off our chairs by the red hot chilli peppers in a chicken salad starter. The waitress then told us that each small bite of chicken salad in a leaf contained 20 varieties of chilli and was known as fire engine. She also told us—and this I liked—that street food has intense flavours of salty, chill, sour, sweet and has to be tempered with rice since rice is free. The dishes I liked best in our order were the relatively pedestrian pad thai and the water cress. The tender coconut (drink) was sweet and cool but a whopping $12. But I'll certainly return to try other street specialties in a posh setting and because the overall experience was very pleasant
4
This place offers interesting Thai food (some infused with other cuisines). A good mix of herbs and other ingredients makes the taste quite distinctive. However it could have been nicer if they can reduce salt content in the food (found it a little too salty for my taste). Mint breeze is a must try! It's a little pricey, given the prime location and menu crafted by celebrity chef.
5
A friend who visited Singapore recently recommended this restaurant and I really enjoyed the prix fixe lunch overlooking the water, and also high above the casino at Marina Bay Sands. It is hard to find, although the digital maps in the Marina Bay complex are helpful in figuring it out. My shrimp curry was delicious and deconstructed, and also fiery. Bring Kleenex and be prepared for watery eyes and having to blow your nose! I'm usually pretty good with spicy food, and this was on the higher register of heat for me
3
I must state up front that I am a massive fan of the food of David Thompson. I have been to his restaurants in Sydney,London and Bangkok and absolutely rave about them. I even have a picture taken with David from my visit to Nahm in Bangkok taking pride of place at home in our kitchen.That said I simply found his set menu which I chose here too hot for my taste. Nowhere near as refined as his previous offerings.. And the service was lacking in professionalism. I was so disappointed asI flew from Australia and stopped off in Singapore on my way to to Vietnam specifically for this meal
4
Spicy! Spicy! Spicy! If you love spicy food, you must try Long Chim. Food was fantastic but service was a little rough.
3
Nothing with mentioning.... It seems a very norm food court to me, smokes everywhere, staffs were everywhere but not very attentive. Not going back there again, I rather go JIM Thomson.
3
Food good - not wow!!! Looking for the elusive great Thai cuisine experience in Singapore - this, unfortunately wasn't it. Pleasant enough, but not worth a return visit.
5
Staff excellent and treated us so well - we'd just got engaged and they surprised us with a candle in our dessert
5
The place has quirky deco. Food was flavourful, although was a tad too salty. We had tom yum, duck curry, fish baked in salt, pad thai. My favourite is pad thai, it had a good balance between sour, sweet n saltiness and is moist.
3
This place does not serve the typical Thai food, and some of it has a modern twist to it, and if you are expecting real authentic thai food, you will be disappointed. However, the food served is pretty good and has an interesting twist to it. The service is pretty good as well, and the only down side is that it is really really expensive
4
My daughters took us there for Father's Day last week (and mom footed the bill!). It was a surprise, largely because I'm not a big fan of Thai food.Well, what a surprise. Long Chim serves Thai Street food, not the usual soupy curries that all taste the same.All of us chose the degustation menu, which included 7or 8 dishes and had a couple of drinks from the mixologist. The drinks were very interesting, full of flavor. The appetizers came either betel leaf wrapped or wrappable, nicely presented. The main dishes were also quite nice, with distinct flavors and textures, not curry-pap. Dry enough to be eaten without rice.Fair warning, also by the waiter, this menu is spiceeey. Loved it.For being located in MBS/SG, the prices are reasonable. I wouldn't mind another "surprise" there
3
The ambience of the restaurant, made to look like a Thai street environment, was lovely.While the online reviews rated this restaurant pretty positively, I am a tad disappointed with both food and service.In general, the food was too salty. Also, the service staff missed/mixed up one of our orders that resulted in an extremely long wait and when asked, had taken an incorrect order. This is quite unforgivable as we went through the order with the order taker and the restaurant was not crowded at all (less than 10 tables occupied)
5
I was looking forward to this for months and Long Chim did not disappoint. I wish I could remember the bar tenders name, pink mo hawk, friendly and full of great conversation. Tor Kor and 555 my favourite on the bar. The decor reminiscent of a cool Bangkok bar, and the scents from the dining room lead us like rats under the spell of the Pide Piper!Chiang Mai laap hot, zingy with spice and moreish with every bite. Prions noodles subtle and smoky perfect for us after a tear jerking starter.We had a great chat to the chef and with his recommendation Banana Roti followed and a taste of his Durian ice cream, to steal my daughters expression, OMG! My wife was going back for seconds, thirds and licked the bowl.Thank you Long Chim I hope we see you in Brisbane some day soon
5
Been here again on a recent trip and one thing for sure is that it is consistently good. If you like authentic Thai flavours this is the place to go - and great if you like spicy dishes - plenty to choose from here.The cocktails are also excellent.Wish they would open up a restaurant in Sydney
3
Service is good and attentive! Restaurant ambiance also nice. Location inside the Casino area, hence a little bit difficult to find the way. Be ready for the sour and spicy food!

I had heard about Long Chim and decided to try it. First, let me explain my rating. The food and service here warrant an Excellent. The Very Good resulted from three things that a truly Excellent restaurant would have insured never happened--a very smoky smell upon entering the restaurant (it smelled as if there had been a kitchen fire at the kitchen station near the entrance--very off putting when you expect a fine dining experience!), the hostess trying to seat me in the bar area where the smokiness was greatest (I had to ask to be moved away from the smoke as if she had no idea that there was a strong odor in the air that would taint the food experience) and the prices--very high for Thai food, although pretty consistent with the very pricey group of celebrity chef restaurants in the Marina Bay Sands Shoppes. All of that said, service was excellent--attentive and competent. And the food was among the best dishes in a Thai style that I have ever had, and I've had some excellent Thai food in Bankok! Not being terribly hungry, I opted for a small appetizer--cured pork fritters which were superb! They were followed by the absolutely best masaman beef curry I have ever had. This version was more like a rich braised short ribs with Thai spices and potatoes. A must have! Finished off with their delicious Thai coffee ice cream and the meal was perfect! Now, they need to attend to the details I mentioned above
1
I thought being in Singapore we should try some oriental food.The restaurant decoration was authentic and creative, with open cooking stations. The service was ok and the food was terrible! The lamb skewers for starters was not that bad. However for the main meal we had Pad Thai (ok), lamb ribs which was nearly char burnt and did not have much meat on them and the Thai chicken curry had small pieces of chicken full of chewy un edible bits. We both did not touch this dish. On a good note the staff figured that we was not happy and did not charge us.It is not like we do not know Thai food,as last year we got married in Thailand and the food in the resort was amazing! Gutted I did not try Wolfgang Cu

With David Thomsons name attached to it you have a certain expectation, unfortunately long chim did not live up to it! Thai food is all about balance of flavours, the balance was off here. Too citrus or too sweet, unfortunately I think they are trading on the name. If David Thompson visited and actually ate here weekly I'm sure he would agree. We had the eggplant salad, pork skewers, prawn betel leaf, pad Thai and duck curry. The duck curry was the most disappointing because we received a single duck leg chopped, bone and all, so hardly any meat. I've eaten at Sailors thai Sydney and Nahm Bangkok, unfortunately Long Chim is no better than my local Thai..

We paid a visit to Long Chim just after Christmas 2015 and loved it so much we booked to go back for our NYE dinner and we were not disappointed.When we arrived on our first visit our table wasn’t ready so we sat at the front bar and had a cocktail while we waited. The 2 mixologists working behind the bar were amazing and very friendly guys. I was intrigued watching them making all the cocktails and they had no issues with me asking questions.. The cocktails are great and about $20 a pop. They do a fabulous Negroni. Sean behind the bar was fabulous, thanks for looking after us.The restaurant is quite big with some booth style seating at the entry with another dining area near the kitchen and further seating along the window. The staff are friendly and attentiveFirst visit we had the beef skewers $16, beef noodle $30, mussaman curry $34, banana roti $12 we loved them all, stand out favorite was the mussaman curry. The banana roti for dessert was to die for however it is very sweet with a lot of condensed milkSecond visit we had the spicy pork $23 (very spicy), mussaman curry (again, couldn’t resist), vegetable curry $24 and the mango sticky rice $14 – another delicious mealWe will be visiting again when we return to Singapore. We had dined in Long Chim Perth before we went to Singapore and we enjoyed the food more in Singapore. We also visit Nahm in Bangkok every time we go (annually) Long Chim Singapore still takes the cake

Long Chim is a great first date restaurant, or greta at any time when you want fabulous energy, great food and to see gorgeous people. It is one of Singapore's best kept secrets. not many restaurants in Asai manage to pull of fabulous Asian food and a trendy setting, but this one does.The cocktails are sensational, and there are many you will never have seen before - how refreshing. The menu is predominantly Thai and dishes are all designed to be shared.The kitchen is partly exposed, so depending on where you sit, you can really feel a part of the excitement and pace of the cooking process.Dishes include many traditional Thai favourites such as Pad Thai and green chicken curry, but the minced beef served with a fried egg, and braised hock with five spice were fiery and delicious.The grilled lamb chops with chillies and garlic and coconut cream were something different which I liked.One warning - if you don't like spicy food, be sure to let them know right up front, otherwise everything about a night out here is a lot of fun. Prices are ok

Great experience. Food quality was very high. The fish cakes were particularly excellent, as was (surprisingly) the water cress vegetable. The prawn and fish laksa was super spicy but great. The palm sugar pudding was a treat. Very friendly, helpful service. Our waiter made very good suggestions. We ordered a starter we didn't like the look of and it was promptly changed. We sat in the corner tables overlooking the city which were slightly away from the din of the main dining area. Overall vibe of the place was very cool.

Booked a table for two before catching a show at MBS Mastercard Theatre. Great ambience, nice decor, superb viewFood was decent but we expected higher standard on such celebrity chef restaurantWe had beef skewers (covered in soot), beef salad with basil leaves (extremely salty!), crunchy prawn cakes (decent though a tad too salty), chives cake (decent). The saving grace were duck with red curry (tender meat) and thai coffee ice cream (yummy!)Overall a decent experience but for the raves and also the price, food could have been betterPros:Good service, attentive staff, fast serviceCons:Food tasted so-s

Heard so much buzz about this joint that i decided to give my mum a treat here for Mother's Day. Maybe it was me having too high an expectation as Long Chim didn't really live up to the hype. Food wise, I must say that overall, it was ok. However, my folks felt that all the dishes were a bit heavy handed on the salt. You might want to request for the chef to go easy on the salt for all the dishes. And they have this sun dried squid which we had to return to the kitchen as it was so salty that we decided that it was inedible. The tom yum soup was also lukewarm when it was served to us. And the service here leaves much to be desired. Firstly, when i made the reservation, i specifically requested for two baby chairs and they even confirmed my request a day before my booking. But when i arrived, they told me they ran out of baby chairs (FYI, they only had 3 baby chairs in the entire restaurant!) and that I had to wait for other guests to finish before i can have the chairs. So i asked them how do they plan to seat the kids in the meantime? of course, they were dumbfounded. Only when i pushed for it, they started to scramble to ask other restaurants to see if they had extra baby chairs. In the middle of the dinner, one of the kids knocked over a cup of glass water and not a single waiter came to help us to clean up or offered a fresh napkin for us to clean up the spill. When we handed the waiter the wet napkins, they just said thank you. Unbelievable

This was our first visit to Long Chim. Having been regulars at Nahms London and been to Nahms Bangkok on a number of occasions, we wanted to experience David's Street Food scene. If you've been to Nahms, Long Chim is definitely more urban. Food wise we weren't disappointed- we did get the flavours we loved and recognised. We had the tasting menu which gave a broad range of offerings. As other reviewers mentioned, we did get asked how we fare with heat, I'm as hot as it gets, my partner is more on the medium range. a hint: if you are middle of the range, ask for a plate of slices cucumber, this will cut the heat of it if does get too hot. We went back a couple ofDays later and ordered our favourites from the previous tasting, which were spicy minced pork, beef salad and stir fry beans. We added Pad Thai which was the best I ever tasted. We sat at the pass, and watched them prepping the food. As we came in towards the end of lunch service, watched them clearing and prepping for evening service. Every was clean, and the diligence of the staff was great. Also met Chef Annita which was a bonus. All in all a great experience and was extremely happy to have yet again tasted some great Thai food. If you have time , sit at the bar and ask for a ginger Martini, their new batman makes a mean one

Food taste delicious, full of flavor. The tom yum soup is awesome! but it gets cold too fast, and it's not as yummy when the food turns cold.
5
Highly recommend a visit. Delicious food and really funky decor... Enough vegetarian options - would have liked more!
3
As most know, this is started by the same chef at Nahm Bangkok and raved by many to be the best. I would just say once is enough and I prefer my thai food to be simple and robust.
5
All we ordered was delightfully tasty. From the pork belly gai lan to the red duck curry, every dish was mouthwatering and we want more even after we felt full!
4
Consistently innovative and delicious, David Thompson's new venture Long Chim does not disappoint. On par with Nahm in London. Great food, stunning decor and great ambience.

I finally had the time to make a table reservation with my partner at Long Chim. It was not meant to be a dinner date, rather it was just a casual night out for dinner, hence, our orders were quite simple. As locals, we stuck with the traditional pad thai for my partner and minced beef with rice for me (yes, boring, I know). When served, the two dishes look very presentable and the taste of the pad thai was pretty similar to the ones I had recently at Phuket so I guess you could say the taste is relatively authentic. The only downside to our experience was that the minced beef is a tad salty and the price is on the high end ($30 for the pad thai)Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I will consider another visit to try the other dishe

It was my wife's birthday last evening. We had a drink at Cut, just one floor below Long Chim where we had a table booked for dinner. The drink was divine. Try the Samurai Sword (S$30). After finishing the drink we got to Long Chim, arriving exactly on time. There was no one at the reception. We waited. There were four members of the staff hanging around behind the bar, making conversation even as they saw us waiting. After about five minutes, I walked up to one of them and asked to be seated. Things moved fast after that. We were seated at a table next to the open kitchen. The ambience, I have to say, was quite nice; reminiscent of the streets of Thailand. We ordered some drinks (Johnnie Walker Black $20 for a single shot). We ordered chives cakes, stir-fried beef with basil (comes with rice and a fried egg) and grilled fish (at $55 for two fillets, the costliest item on the menu). And that's when things started to go downhill. The chives cake were soggy and sticky. The stir-fried beef tough and hard to chew. And the most disappointing grilled fish; it was lathered in some sort of sticky syrup that entirely hijacked the taste of the fish. In the open kitchen there was much pounding of pestles, flambeing of food, and a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. If it's good Thai food or even innovative Thai food that you're looking for, there are better, and cheaper, places in Singapore

We came here after a show at MBS Theatre and the staff let us in even though they were close to closing. That put us in a good mood to start with, although i did think restaurants at a casino could usually afford to stay open a bit later.The service was good although it did start to taper away a bit towards the end - possibly because we were the 2nd last table to finish.The food was great and definitely authentic (my dining companion was Thai). We loved the curry and the mango sticky rice.The only real disappointment was the wine list. Even in Singapore, a wine list should have a couple of reasonably priced bottles (in Singapore I classify that as S$50 - S$60+++) of decent wine. We had to make do with an $80+++ bottle of sparkling wine which was nice but more than I like to pay
5
First the food, if you like your Thai food spicy, then this one is for you. Even though we ordered a couple of "mild" dishes, they still required liquid refreshment to fully enjoy. This is by no means a criticism of the food, it is spicy and it is delicious. Also working in our favour was the happy hour drinks at the time. You'll be able to find something on the menu that really appeals as there is good variety. The venue is wonderful too, accessed via the Casino lobby with great aspect views over the river. The atmosphere is sophisticated and modern. The service was also very good and accommodating. We had to rush off to the Blue Man Group concert and we were in, well fed and out in a little over an hour. But this is a place were it would be great to linger for a few post dinner drinks.Very happy overall with the Long Chim experience

I went to celebrate my birthday at this restaurant yesterday as it came highly rated. So disappointed that I am compelled to write this review. The food is below average for a celebrity chef restaurant. We ordered the watercress, way too salty and not crunchy. ordered the papaya salad, almost mushy and over the top spicy (and I can handle spicy food). The mussam beef curry had chewy beef and the thai green curry was very oily and salty and spicy at the same time. I did like the decor but thats about all I liked
4
Decided to give this a go..the rice noodle dish was our favourite..smokey flavour made it amazing. Was very quiet but enjoyed our meal.
5
great service, friendly, helpful and attentive. food was yumz, best thai food outside of thailand. Had been to Namh, Chef David's other restaurant, though concept is different, the taste of the dishes are still as excellent. will definitely return!
5
Fabulous food, great service and atmosphere.
Thai food in David Thompson's interpretation is full of subtle amazing flavours. Not to be missed!

Living in LA I have experienced amazing celebrity chef restaurants and was excited to hear that Long Chim was in our hotel. I love spicy food, but the chicken curry was not a curry by any means and was covered in jalapeÃ±os and habaneros. Despite removing all of that, the chicken was still hard to consume. I could have gone across the river and gotten actual curry for 1/4 of the cost. Not worth it at all. We ended up leaving and going somewhere else
3
Good stuff: "crunchy prawn cakes" were more crunchy prawn and no "cake" element but really good for snacking if you're having a beer, "minced beef chillies garlic hot basil fried egg" with rice as well as "grilled wagyu beef roasted rice and long leaf coriander" - such winners, great flavours, though the latter's beef is a little chewy for some, I loved it.I wouldn't order it again: "charred rice noodles pork yellow beans and chinese broccoli" was really on the charred side, "coconut cake" I could have done without - did not understand the texture or flavour for the price (you could just go to Bengawan Solo and get assorted kuehs)Cocktails had interesting flavours but watered down quickly and weren't much to shout about.Ambience was very cute and asian (heh), we adored the details in cutlery and the interesting alfresco setting which we didn't quite expect (we thought it would be fully air-conditioned). Depending where you are seated, you may walk out smelling of fried food as the cooking gets quite intense.Can't comment on value as it was their anniversary promotion with the featured dishes going for $9++ each
5
To escape from the heat we dropped into the air conditioned comfort of the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre. We followed the signs for the restaurants and stumbled upon Long Chim which from the outside overlooks the amazing Casino. We only intended to have a light bite to eat but the menu was quite expensive and there was a set menu that was such good value for loads of courses it seemed daft not to take advantage of it. The food was lovely (and pretty spicy) We were quite late for lunch and were the last ones in the restaurant but never felt rushed by the lovely staff. Great cocktail too! Would definitely revisit when next in Singapore
5
Reading the reviews, I can't comment on the service directly. We sat at the noodle bar seating, so we were closely attended to by the noodle chefs. This was a very fun interaction with the crew. As for the food,it was flavorful, good sized, and reasonably priced. The one memorable item was one of the condiments: the sweet chili sauce. This was hand-crafted and was one of the best things I have ever eaten. I could have ordered a bowl of this stuff and savored every spoonful (devoid of any other food item). It was not too spicy, but it was so floral and full of unami
2
Food flavours are authentic and great. Portions slightly small. But service was poor. Poorly led staff. Wrong order and no apology from waiter. Charged for the wrong order as well and after pointing out the mistake, the waiter still wanted to argue about it. Manager did not handle it well leaving poor after taste. Asked for carpark redemption for two and only given one as told they ran out on a Monday evening!! Decor was rather shabby and does not befit the pricing. Aircondition would be better
5
Chef David Thompson has delivered yet again with his own take on authentic Thai street food. Be prepared to have your taste buds tingled and toasted with the best of Thai spices and flavours. Unfortunately a little away from the main dining areas of the building, it delivers totally in its food and charm. Exciting cocktails and a fairly priced menu ensure that this establishment will be around for quite a while as it spreads its taste around the region. Excellent service overall! Happy to go back again and again

I booked Long Chim for lunch when my family was over visiting me in Singapore. Having been raised in the far east and as a true foodie, we had been eating fantastic food all week. My grandmother wanted to see Marina Bay Sands and in keeping with the Asian dining theme, thought a nice Thai restaurant for lunch would fit the bill. The restaurant decor was respectable, modern with clean lines and quirky touches. Staff were attentive and polite. Bathrooms were clean and spacious. Alas, that is where the positives stop. The starters to be fair were ok. The spring rolls were flaky and thin with fresh ground pork and vermicelli inside. Aside from the over salting, these were the best part of the meal. The crunchy prawn cakes were just deep fried "pakora esque". Batter soaked and hard but again, not terrible. I love Thai food but what we received for our main courses were almost inedible. Goopy, sour prawn pad thai arrived with limp vegetables, thick almost soy like sauce and minuscule prawns. It smelt almost rotten. Pad thai is one of my favourite dishes and I have had it hundreds of times in Singapore, Thailand and abroad - this had to be the worst ever - and at over SGD30 per course... you'd expect gourmet standards! The duck curry was bland and chewy, the boiled rice accompanying it tasted as though it came out of an Uncle Ben's minute rice packet. The squid was just rubber (we sent this back and handly touched any of the other dishes). Was truly disappointed as expected a lot more from MBS. I have never had a bad dining experience at MBS before (I've eaten at Waku Ghin, Imperial Treasure, Mozza, DB and others in the shoppes and have always been satisfied). A scam of an experience. Feel cheated to be honest - especially at those prices. Luckily the rest of our meals during the week made up for it. And for value for money... Soi 60 on Rob Quay over this any day
3
The food & ambience was nice but the total experience wasn't satisfied because I carried a very high expectation. David Thompson is the "God Father" of Thai cuisine and I felt that there is there are improvement space.
5
Had a great dinner there with my partner, and had the tastiest laksa ever.
Great ambience and nice service.
3
Having been to Nahm in Bangkok i had high expectations for this Singapore David Thompson restaurant - sadly was left pretty disappointed.Positives:The venue is lovely with a great bar area and private dining roomsOpen kitchen conceptWide menu offerNegatives:All dishes are overpriced Staff really don't understand the dishesDishes very small portionsFood was just very average - i've had a lot better phad thai from street vendors.We checked spice levels before ordering the Laab, the waitress informed us that it was spicy and suggested another dish - this however was so spicy it was literally inedible. To be fair they comped the dish but not really what i expect at a restaurant of this calibre.Tellingly the place was virtually empty on a Friday night
3
which was okay, but nothing special! The service of our waiter was excellent! The restaurant was too warm! Eating out at a market in Thailand is much more authentic and fresh! I have the feeling all dishes are pre cooked and just heated up!It is not a must to eat out at Long Chim for us again
2
We only went as the web said it was Michelin. Very average. Corner of mall, quiet, warm. Crispy salty fish came out cold, not crispy nor salty just plain white fish. Have had better beef curry and the chicken was a simple home made grilled chicken. The laksa curry sauce was too light for my liking. We only enjoyed the eggplant salad.
4
Not a big fan of super sweet cocktails but the sublimely refreshing 555 kept me quenched throughout the meal. Some dishes were very spicy (not a complaint, I like it hot, but just a point to note). The duck fried rice was a winner but we were disappointed with the starter fish cakes, they just weren't hugely tasty. Service was attentive but we were advised to order more than we needed, some of the portions are quite big. I did find a small piece of plastic in one dish. Some people would be furious about this, I wasn't, I understand these things happen but I expected more than just a free plate of greens. I like this restaurant and I think, given the atmosphere and ambience, it would be great for a dinner party but not every dish shines so pick with care
3
Service was very good. They explained the dishes to us. The cocktails were on the pricy side however so blend and weak. Larb chicken was overpowering spicy that practically ruined my dinner (which might be partly my fault. They did warn us). Other starts and a curry we ordered were very average, too. Overall bad value in singapore
4
We had the pleasure of dining at Long Chim in Singapore last night. Booking on line is very efficient and indeed allowed us to change a booking effortlessly. As you walk into this restaurant you immediately feel as if you are entering the food streets of Bangkok.Two choices of menu at night, a la cartel or Set menu, think carefully before you choose. If you are big eaters a set menu is fantastic and a good way to sample the range of food available on the menu. Service was impeccable although we had an early booking and the food seemed to come pretty quickly! When asked about tolerance to hot spicy food, be warned, hot is really hot! Our pick of the menu were the starters and the dessert, durian ice cream and banana roti, having said that everything else was great.A great night but not inexpensive. Next time we are in Singapore we will definitely go back. A big call when we know the range of food available in this city state
5
The food is everything you would expect from David Thompson. While based on street food, the flavors and textures were quite sophisticated and the beverage selections well thought out.3 of us shared the plates, each selecting an entree and main (not American "entree). With rice, that proved to be plenty.The Marina Bay Sands is such a monster of a place that it was a little hard to find, but well worth the effort.Sorry - didn't take pics of anything. Too busy eating it

Visited here for dinner and was very impressed, we had a wonderful starter of beef skewers which was very tender and spicy with Miami prawn which was spicier and came in an eatable leaf.We selected three main dishes which really was just to try to see how good the food was.We had a fantastic duck curry, the the other dishes was soft shell crab, wow this was hot but very nice, followed by Santa dig a which was brockley with noodles which was great and a lot less hotter, the service was attentive and very good.Would definitely go here again to try other dishes ,not cheap at 190 dollars then add the ten percent service charge and tax at seven percent, so bill was 233 dollars with one bottle of wine
5
Been here twice and this place never disappoints. The ingredients were very fresh and I love the different spices used in the dishes. Will definitely be back to try the other dishes!
4
While my dining companions and I enjoyed the experience at Long Chim, we all suffered cases upset stomachs later in the evening. The food was great, but perhaps it was something unclean inbthe preparation. Otherwise, we all had a good time.
5
we were there on a Sunday night, so it wasn't busy, so atmosphere I guess was a little quiet, but the food was sensational ! - soft shell crab a fav. & the staff very friendly.
4
Just like in Bangkok, the food was great. We ordered spicy dishes and they were really spicy! Prices were reasonable for this type celebrity chef's restaurant.
5
Beautiful food with freshly ground spices. Didn't expect to be so impressed. Big menu, tastes fresh. Nice atmosphere.Highly recommend. Great value too.
4
This is the sort of place I shouldn't really like. It looks ever so "Casino"; rather over decorated and terribly "themed". It is trying so hard to be quirky, but of course when you throw this sort of money at it, it just looks put on. But then there is the food. Bold flavours, artfully layered, beautifully thought out, expertly prepared. The only concession that has been made for it to appeal to a broader public is a reduction in the spiciness. David Thompson has a lot of detractors and I cannot for the life of me see why he should. He is a master at his craft, even if that craft is the cuisine of someone else's country.
5
Everyone loves Thai food but the menu looks similar in all these restaurants. How ever Long Chim serves street food and has a great set of dishes served up in a fancy dining environment. The food was just amazing and the flavors were distinctive. A must go to for every visitor and resident.

My wife loves Nahm in Bangkok and was looking forward to sampling the menu of David Thompson's Long Chim restaurant in Singapore. Unfortunately, we came away disappointed. The (lunch) menu was simple; it would have been better with more choices and more exciting options. We ordered the fish-cake, wagyu-beef skewers, green chicken curry and Prin's noodles..and found out later that they are all rather spicy. I do like spicy food but it would have been better to have a balance
5
We've been here twice, and loved it each time. The range of dishes is excellent. The flavours are full-on, and hot means hot! However, there's plenty for more timid palates as well. It's really designed for sharing, so get together as many diners as you can, to maximise the number of different things to try.There's a very good range of cocktails (and mocktails), and a good wine list chosen with an eye to matching the bold flavours of the food.The entry through MBS is a little grim (ditto the views of the gaming floor of the Casino), but once inside, you're a world away from all that, and the atmosphere is terrific.The staff are very courteous and helpful, and will tell you if you've ordered too much.If you want authentic Thai street food tastes, but in a civilised setting, this palace is a must
5
Having first eaten at David Thomson's Darly St establishment many years ago was excited to eat here...was NOT disappointed.The fit out is tastefully done..another example of the low key industrial appearance but no doubt very expensive !Tried numerous dishes and each was better than the one preceding...he need to open an outlet in Melbourne ASAP !Well priced wine list to compliment the food.Very friendly and knowledgeable staff together with sublime food make this a most pleasurable dining experience ...one not too be missed
4
I visited Long Chim on January 15 for team lunch. The ambience was great. The food was also tasty and clean hotel and polite staff.
5
We absolutely loved Long Chim. The cocktails were fantastic and very unique, the food had extraordinary flavours and staff were very friendly and attentive without being annoying. Pricing was reasonable for the standard.
5
We ate here twice. Delicious authentic Thai flavours ... and Spicy too! We paid S$100 a head to share 4 dishes + rice + beer. Recommended.
1
while service was good, food was a let down. the recommended beef skewers had the thinnest slice of beef and tough like rubber. there wasn't a dish that stood out that night and we had quite a few of the recommended dishes.
4
Service was friendly from the hostess at the door to the goodbyes from everyone when we left. It was a busy night but all effort was made to ensure that we were seated at the time of our reservation (we were early). Possibly a tad understaffed but they said that they were 20% busier than expected for a normal weekday. We couldn't really fault them though as it was obvious that every staff was doing the best they can, and were also helping each other mind the different sections of this very large restaurant.We had the Duck Curry, the papaya salad, the Talipaia and some specials. All were delicious and authentic. No watering down of dishes here- they are prepared and served as they are in Thailand. The menu does indicate which are spicy for dinners not accustomed to this type of food.Only criticism would be that the portions could be more generous for the dishes, especially at this price (>$30 for the mains) but in all, a good experience
4
Came here to celebrate my birthday with my family. We were already in awe of the surroundings even before entering the restaurant. The restaurant itself provided a very rustic yet relaxed feel to it, we felt welcomed even from the decor. The staff were also very welcoming. The restaurant itself is pretty big, with a few different dining areas. The food we ordered was great, I was happy as I had not had good Thai food in a very long time. Long Chim reminded me of why I first fell in love with Thai food in the first place. I especially really liked the duck curry dish, the flavours of the curry werr well balanced with the duck. The dess‪ert was good as well, enjoyed the mango sticky rice, which is my all time favourite. However, we ordered a spicy starter which was a bit too hot for our liking. Our waitperson was very attentive and brought fresh cucumber slices to help tone down the spiciness we were experiencing. Overall, it was a good dining experience with a good balance between the food, staff and environment.

We thought we'd try the original Long Chim before the new one that's recently opened in Perth - we thought they would have ironed out any teething problems etc. The food was good - authentic and interesting - just what you'd expect from David Thompson. It didn't hit any high notes, though, I was hoping for something a little better. Admittedly this could have been our party's lack of consensus on any of the dishes (to order, that is), which left us with a bit of an unbalanced selection of dishes. What we did have was more than acceptable, just not out of this world. The selection included crispy prawn cakes, spinach & rice cakes, som tam, aubergine, noodles and green curry. The one negative would be the paltry amount of chicken in the bowl - barely enough for 4 of us to have one bite size piece each.The cocktails were also a little disappointing - neither of mine were something I would order again, and my first choice was not being made any more (take it off the menu then, get some more printed!). Wine was predictably expensive (it's Asia), but an ok list with a reasonable selection of wine by the glass.Only one of us had dessert and I'm here to tell you it was divine. Thai coffee ice cream - wow - it was really, really good (and I'm somewhat of an ice cream fanatic).The service is what really let this place down. It was friendly enough, but they really weren't very professional - they didn't know how to check the room for tables needing service, seemingly avoiding any eye contact wih customers when you needed them! We waited for what seemed forever for our order to be taken (after asking for a couple more minutes after their first attempt at taking our order), and waiting for the bill to be processed bordered on faulty towers it took so long. If we didn't need the credit card back, we would have just left. Crazy.Having said that, if I could, I'd give a rating of 3.5 - it's better than average. I'm looking forward to trying the new Perth restaurant on my retun to oz
1
Nothing more irritating than to pay overpriced food for less than average quality food : $ 16 for 5 miniature wagyu beef skewers ! If the taste was excellent then I don't mind but the taste was bad & the size was small. In fact everything that we ordered taste less than average (probably Mr Dave Thompson wasn't around that day because we saw others people end of year reviews they weren't so impressed either). Larp Chiang Mai ($16) was so spicy it made us cough, Fish Cake ($17) were bitter, Prin Noodle like bitter & overpriced kwetiau imitation, Coconut Noodles like a bad imitation of laksa & you pay $ 30 each. Fried Grouper ($55) were over fried it become dry (read my other reviews for the best fried fish in Asia). Grilled Long Eggplant Salad was so sour I just eat the steam egg (24$)The only thing that were so so were Red Curry Kampung "village" Chicken, Grilled Lamb Ribs(each gonna cost you $30) & Banana Roti dessert. The Durian Ice Cream dessert was sooooo sweeeet & the Thai Coffee ice cream was soooo overly bitter. Mango sweet sticky rice just nothing special. Desserts gonna cost you $15 on average.I'm not stingy about food costs as you can read my others reviews but this is irritating!The only reason it still get a star because there's no option of not giving a star at all & service + ambience were excellent by the way
2
Probably only few can enjoy the over powering saltyness and sweetness in the dishes. Wagyu beef too salty, pork filet too salty, pad thai too sweet...... We also ordered a grilled lobster which came under cooked which which we sent back. For a restaurant of this standard we expected a new lobster properly done but the they sent the old one back half overcooked and dry. Sad edperience
4
The food was excellent – authentic Thai flavors taken up a notch. Small plates like the fish cakes ($17) and spring rolls ($18) are not to be missed. The former crunchy with an explosion of flavor; the latter extremely crisp, accompanied by an addictive spicy chili bean sauce.For the mains, we ordered pad thai ($30) – loved how springy the noodles are, slicked with just the right amount of sauce with a burst of sweet citrus from the addition of starfruit. The chicken green curry ($24) was a heady mix of aromatic Thai spices. That alone, paired with fragrant steamed white rice, would be all you'd need. Portions are good to share, and prices are reasonable. Service was friendly as well. Will definitely return to try the rest of their dishes
4
Went for the degustation dinner they offer - good value. Unfortunately some of the dishes couldn't make it, agreed by the whole table. Next time will go for their a la carte menu. Good cocktails and great interior.
5
I have to say it has to be one of the best Thai restaurants I have ever been to. The service was amazing. The quality of the food was outstanding. Such a great vibe in the restaurant as well. A must visit
3
Food was ok, dinning room nice hype huge, bigger than the delivery. The food was hot hot hot, very hot. A bit too hot for me if I'm honest. Table service friendly but quite disjointed and shambolic. We received our first course before any drinks or even water. Did I mention the food is hot. We also benefited from reviving 2 courses from another table....
5
Went as a big group and they were great at welcoming us. They helped us all chose cocktails and advised us on which ones to go for. We went as a birthday dinner and they brought out a free cocktail and free desert. The food was amazing pretty spicy but great all round. Definitely worth a visit!
4
If you are looking for a unique atmosphere, delightful ambiance, very good service and tantalizing Thai cuisine, you will want to spend an evening at the Long Chim Singapore Restaurant @ The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands.Beginning with the warm and helpful telephone conversation to make a reservation to the heart-felt welcome upon arrival, this restaurant understands how to make a meaningful connection with their customers.The Thai cuisine has a definite flare not experienced in other Thai restaurants in Singapore and the personal touch and artistry of Head Chef Yingyod Raktham is exceptional.We were so impressed with the flavor of his dishes, that we asked him to visit our table where he took the time to share his passion with Thai cuisine; especially the spices within the Roast Duck on Rice with pickled ginger and dark soy and BBQ Pork on Rice with hoisin and chili sauces. .This is an exceptional choice to take a special friend, partner, spouse or customer who appreciates all aspects of a culinary experience.We did not feel we were in Singapore during our dining experience and fondly remembered our visits and experiences to the Kingdom of Thailand during our special dinner evening
4
We went on a Saturday night (having made a booking on the Chope website). The decor was funky and modern but dark. The menu was extensive and the portion sizes OK. The food was relative spicy but good - we tried the papaya salad, fish cakes, fried grouper and red curry prawns. The mains were OK. However the highlight was dessert - we tried the banana roti which was decadent, sticky rice with mango and gula Melaka pudding. Dessert made the meal!Relatively extensive drinks/cocktail and wine list. Worth trying for a fun meal.
4
The staff were friendly. The food was authentic and had many 'different to the usual Thai' dishes.The service was rapid (we had one hour to order and eat).Outstanding dishes included:- spicy pork appetizer (with Betel leaves)- Mango salad with trevally- crab meat, fried riceLess appealing to our taste were:- snakehead fish curry (came with plain rice but not needed) - a little too bitter/sour- Chinese broccoli with pork - sauce was quite strong but effect was still deliciousThe menu was pricey however the location no doubt dictates this. Dinner for two with 3 glasses of house wine at SG$23
2
We love Thai food and often enjoy meals in small local coffee shops etc. I thought we would try a 'posh' Thai meal, must be better , quality ingredients freshest and best. Prawns were dry and chewy (the few there were) a handful of small pieces of duck in the red curry (which saucewise wasn't bad to be fair). Small portions and no better than a cheap hawker style food outlet in my experience. Beef skewers were quite nice but small
3
I've eaten at Nahm bangkok a few times and loved it. Was looking forward to eating here since it's the same David ThompsonWe settled on the $88 set dinner to save the effort on picking and assumed it represents the signature dishesA couple of amuse bouche/starters came - meatballs and minced meat wrapped in leaf. They were okThe 5 mains all came at once and it went downhill from there. For 3 of us , I must say the portions are tiny. The beef curry was a small soup bowl with 5 minute pieces of beef. The salt grilled fish was ok to me though my friends thought it was too salty. The squid was definitely too salty. The vegetables and brinjal were ordinary Dessert was a small platter of fruits with 1 scoop of ice creamAll our $18 dinner cocktails were also tiny, diluted and ordinary I really wanted to like this place, but it's not impressive at al
4
I've been here twice and I have found the food to be amazing, very tasty. The cocktails are great too. The green beef curry was delicious with melt in your mouth beef. The minced chicken appetiser will blow your head off with chilli, but it's very good! The first time we sat at the high tables for drinks and dinner, we ended up staying for about 4 hours and having a great time. The second time we had drinks at the bar then sat in the main restaurant area. The staff were good overall, not the best service, but Singapore isn't known for good service anyway! It's not a cheap restaurant, but I'm looking forward to going back again at some point. I'm looking forward to trying the pad Thai, which was sold out when I tried to order it last time (this was a let down... A Thai restaurant that ran out of pad Thai!!).
5
I've eaten a lot of Thai food over the years, the food here is amazing, really very good. It's not particularly expensive considering the location, service and quality of food. Definitely worth check out:)
3
The food is refined Thai food. Unfortunately I had a hard time reading the menu in the dim lighting. Only 1 candle on table and the lighting does not allow me to take good food photo.
4
Dinner with friends, good atmosphere, great choice of food. we had a large variety of dishes, all of them were delicious.
Only one thing to improve, service was really quick, almost felt like we were in a fast food.
But will definitely go back
2
Our group of three ordered a fish cake, a wagyu beef salad, a noodle laksa, a stir-fried vegetable, a prawn dish and a red duck curry.The food was at best forgettable. The two mains that we ordered, i.e. the prawn dish and the red duck curry, were poorly executed. The prawns were not fresh at all, just shy of being bad enough for us to return the dish. The duck meat in the red curry was rubbery and flavourless. We didn't finish these dishes.Ambience-wise, the whole place was too dark for my preference. Service was attentive and warm

My husband and I love Thai food; we go to Thailand frequently and we love eating everywhere, even in the street. When Long Chim opened, after having been in the restaurant in Bangkok, we were quite excited (apart front the fact that we are frequent visitors to most of the restaurants in marina Bay Sands so it made it even more perfect).Unfortunately, our expectations were dashed. We loved the place when we arrived. Sat at the bar for a drink before moving to our booking, which was done at the noodle counter. And then it went down the "slope"…..Who doesn't order Pad Thai in a Thai restaurant? well must say that at least 80% of the visitors. We did as we love it and they said they had ran out of the pad thai noodles on a Friday night at 9 pm!!!!! the chef eventually came out to tell us this and excuse himself plus offering other choices, which we declined as our "stomachs" were set on Pad Thai. We ordered a couple of other things and settled to wait for our food. The music started playing and there was a DJ right behind us. This of course made it extremely difficult for us to have a conversation. We kindly asked them to turn the music down…nothing. We asked again and …. nothing. Eventually after the Pad Thai and music made our date night impossible, we decided to ask for the bill and cancel the other items as they hadn't arrived. When we asked for the bill, the music was eventually turned down, bill arrived and one of our dishes did as well. Very kindly management, or whoever was in charge as we never saw management, had deducted all the food items from the bill, which actually we didn't even had except for the mango salad and the duck stir fried rice we got (by the way it was delicious). We asked them to please charge us for all we had consumed as it made us uncomfortable not being charged. perfect opportunity once more for management to show up but still….lost in the ethereal space….So disappointing. We really loved the decor, the people were nice but extremely hit and miss for those prices. At least management should've shown up and we know there was someone around as he was talking to other costumers when we were in the bar and even shared the lift down when we left the building. Visit again…very much doubt i
5
I sat at the bar and watching the two incredibly professional ladies handling the wok for noodles was joy. And the noodles they create are a great tasteFor an adventure try the dish called "Prins noodles"" an unusual mix of si racha and oyster .Sneak into the handicap toilet for a bit of artistic enjoyment
2
I had some Thai Fish Cake, ( which felt flat and alittle chewy) , Papaya Salad.. overly spicy, and we had Pork with kailan... ( prok was suppose to be crispy , but it was a tad too soggy)The ambiance felt wonderful, the placements of deco was superb, perhaps we ordered badly, thus making the meal forgettable. We had wine, a chardonnay and Cab Sev.. felt a little flat too. ..Pity. Staff was really helpful polite and attentive. They asked us how did we feel and we were honest with our feed back . But not much service recovery though.
5
David Thompson might like to call this street food but you don't get this service in the streets of Bangkok.Sure the food is authentic and it's taste and presentation is great, far above what you would get at your local Thai restaurant. But there are enough familiar flavours to make you feel comfortable and enough dishes to make you feel like you have challenged your palate.Taking heed of previous TA reviews we opted for an 8pm reservation so we didn't feel rushed. Staff were patient, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and ingredients.We opted to choose our own dishes rather than go for the S$88 tasting menu (fussy husband doesn't eat eggplant) but we loved the Chicken Larb and Talipia entrees followed by the green curry beef and stir fry crispy pork with rice and roti totally filled us. The dishes are reasonably priced but typical of Singapore the price of wine smashes the bill. Loved it and will go back next time we are in Singapore
5
What a fantastic night. My wife was so looking forward to our visit. When we went to order our waitress Karen made several suggestions for each course. She was spot on and we enjoyed every morsel, the taste of every dish sensational.All the staff were very friendly and made our night
4
If you've eaten at any of David Thimpson restaurants you know it's going to be good! Classic Thai dishes served in a creative way, with delicious complex flavours and aromas that linger. Great papaya salad, fish cakes and aromatic red curry prawns. Attentive staff, and nice ambiance which also added to a very modern Thai vibe
4
Not my first time at Long Chim, but I still enjoy the variety of dishes offered as well as the consistency of the dishes.
3
Overly priced Thai food. Service staff are not polite and food were served quite slow. Not likely to return.
5
I've eaten here twice now and the fresh food and flavors are wonderful. Clean pungent spices and herbs enhance the fresh vegetables and meat.
5
enjoyed my visit here for a business dinner. Ambiance is designed like a Thai night food market. Friendly and efficient staff and food was really good and tasty. As each course was presented we were told about the ingredients with many being supplied directly from Thailand to give that authentic Thai taste.Portion sized were not huge but each dish seemed carefully prepared with beautifully balanced flavours and spices.Would return when next in Singapor
5
I took my wife and mother along to David Thompson's Singapore offering, Long Chim. Coming from Sydney we have been to many Thai eateries but we had very high expectations for this one based on reviews from friends. It is situated in the extravagant Marina Bay Sands, right near the Casino. The first thing you notice is the decor, a modern take on Thai traditional interiors which we were all impressed with and it gives the place a relaxed feel. The most memorable thing aout this place though is the service - something that is usually laking in SIngapore (probably because of enforced 10% service fee). Staff were attentive without being overbearing and we were given free drinks because we had to wait for 30 minutes for our table. They seemed to be everywhere so any questions were sorted out immediately. We went for the sampling option at $88SGD per person which was steep (not for Singapore) but there was a huge selection of food (we could not eat it all) and it was all fresh and fragrant with a generous amount of spice as you would expect from Thai food. The green curry was our favourite, the glass noodles were not. The Thai coffee ice-cream, if you can fit it in, was delicious. I suggest going for a walk around the bay to walk it off afterward
4
Girlfriends and I decided on an impromptu venue for dinner one Sunday evening, and we were lucky that we do not need a reservation nor do we have to wait long for a table. In fact we were ushered in immediately and given a booth. (For those who like to see their food prepared, you can opt to sit at the noodles counter station). We were bowled over by the ambience, tastefully decorated and the lighting was just right. Soft enough to be cozy, without having to squint as you look at the menu. You also can't help but look at the floor as you walk in: lovely tiles artfully scattered. And you HAVE to check out the art work in the washroom!!!! Food-wise, was amazingly delicious! The curries were thick and flavourful, not thin or runny in some Thai restaurants. The Pad Thai was one of the best I've tried. They used special noodles ('shanjan', I think it was called) which is chewy in texture. Unfortunately, the mango sticky rice fell short of my expectations: The sticky rice was wonderful but the mangoes were so-so (but I supposed depends on season).The staff were very helpful in explaining about the ingredients and the food. If they were not sure, they would check and still return to give us an answer. The staff would check on us occasionally to see if we needed anything else, without seeming to intrude. Judy, one of our servers even offered to give us a private tour of the various stations. It was a very enlightening evening!!! We WILL definitely come back to try their other dishes....

Had great expectations for dinner at Long Chim, David Thomson's latest offering for culinary aficionados in Singapore. In terms of ambience and decor, pretty cool set-up. Food? We are very much into Thai food, and love it. But the items we ordered, did not meet the expectations. The papaya salad could have been way better (specially for the price). The Pad Thai noodles was quite glutenous and too spicy for any real taste. Soft shell crab - equally spiced up. We have had quite a bit of Thai street food (low end hawker type) in Thailand, so expectations were for similar fare (spicy and tasty), not just spiced up food. Service was average, the staff appeared to be in a bit of a hurry. Empty dishes were being removed from the table before the main course was over, an absolute "no-no" for a restaurant of this reputation! I think more attention needs to be given overall to make this restaurant a truly great one, in terms of cuisine and service
5
Dined here last night and loved it! They hit the mark with everything - relaxed atmosphere, great decor, attentive but not intrusive service & most importantly fantastic food. The menu offered a different take on Thai cuisine from that we've tried before and everything we ordered was full of flavour & perfectly done - we especially liked the oven cooked duck & lamb ribs. With a huge choice at Marina Bay we were so pleased we dined at Long Chim.
4
Having been at Nahm, Thompson's prestigious restaurant in Bangkok, I was expecting something similar. Long Chim is clearly a bit more simple, and most dishes are full plates of food. Travelling alone, this made it hard for me to be able to sample some different things. The waitstaff wasn't very helpful either when asked for recommendations.. the suggested started I did order, Chiang Mai Chicken, came out as 6 servings on a plate, way too much for 1 person. The waitress recommended Pad Thai for main, but I just couldn't get myself into ordering that when visiting a restaurant like this. I opted for the Lamb Rib Curry which was delicious and soft. There was no room for desert unfortunately. I found SG$11.70 for a double espresso very much on steep side.
5
We really like Thai food and having been to Nahm in Bangkok we decided to try David Thompson's Long Chim in Singapore for lunch.We were greeted warmly by the front of house staff and shown to a nice table. Water was quickly offered as well as the menu. The menu was explained and we decided to partake in a al a carte selection. You could also chose from a 2 course or 3 course set menu.We started with beef skewers marinated in cumin and coriander and spicy pork with mint and roasted rice. We thought the beef skewers were nice but we were blown away by the spicy pork. The pork was a flavour explosion in your mouth. The staff advised we should try the pork with a betel leaf and without to see the difference. Next we had kampong chicken with Thai red curry and peppercorns, fried sun dried fish with papaya and cashews and beef Massamun curry with rice.The chicken and fish were standouts. The curry had to much cinnamon for my taste but the beef was lovely and soft and gelatinous.We could not fit in any noodle dish or dessert but did wash the lunch down with some nicely made cocktails.The restaurant fit out is really nice and the view is amazing.If you want great Thai food, excellent knowledgable service in Singapore then you should book a table at Long Chim
4
The restaurant does not have a set-menu offering, so it's a place you typically do 1-3 courses.
The food taste great, real Thai-flavors.
I really like the mango/sticky rice dessert.
1
We were looking forward but was disappointed!
David Thompson.... with all due respect we expected top notch Thai Street Food in Long Chim after we heard good reviews from reputable chefs around S.E.A & Middle East.
5
One of the better restaurant experiences in Singapore for the combination of food, value for money and service. Great for a group of friends and so good I wrote a blog about it here http://www.singaporefoodie.com/long-chim-singapore/
4
Affordable thai food in nicely done up setting. great place to meet up with friends or have family dinners! Enjoyed my dinner there and will definitely be going back and recommending to my friends!

We came here on a Thursday night with 7 girls and so we ordered almost everything on the menu. :) We were really looking forward to experiencing David Thompson's newest outpost but were left sadly disappointed. The Staples:The papaya salad - terrible and over priced. Quite bland. Such a quintessential street food dish cannot be messed up. Pad Thai - We were told it was made of one of the most expensive noodles. Which goes to show pricey means nothing. At $30 a dish it better have been amazing. Skip it. Maybe they should change the noodles and make it a far less expensive dish.Red prawns in Thai Chili. Overpriced and not good at $37. Between 7 big foodie girls. we had 3 pieces left over. Kanoom Jim (Vermicelli Rice Noodles) with Tomato Sauce - Bland and uninviting. Cure pork starter. Nothing spectacular that I couldn't get in Golden Mile on Beach Road (in Singapore). Cocktails and drinks. We had the mocktails, Thai Ice Tea (wow messed up not sweet or flavourful) and the Lemonade. Needless to say we continued to just drink our water and the champagne and wine.Since it was a birthday dinner we did not have any desserts but our cake. Overall the starters and main were massively disappointing. And I do not write this easily because I really wanted to like this place. I cannot think of a single stand out dish that made any of the 7 big foodie girls happy.Sorry David. We suggest you go back to the kitchen and completely review the entire menu and flavours
5
I've been here twice and both the times I was totally blown away by the food. I think David Thompson has created a restaurant with a lot of soul. The chargrilled noodles, the lettuce wraps, I could go on! Good pricing and the interiors of the restaurant are beautiful. My favourite restaurant in Singapor
4
I'm no expert on Thai food but I've eaten my share in Thailand and outside of Thailand. There's some much these guys get right. Ambiance is great--good lighting (low), cool decor (complete with graffiti and a street cart), nice music, and first-rate service. When it came to the food it was a mixed bag. Of the appetizers the pork "bits" (sorry, I forget what they were called on the menu) I thought were very tasty. The grilled beef sticks were also nice though I thought the beef was a bit too chewy. The vegetarian spring rolls were a disappointment. The wrapper was crisp and not too oily but the contents were bland and the dipping sauce was uninteresting. Of the entrees the Pad Thai I thought was outstanding (and I tend to always try this first at a Thai place as this should be good). The flavors were intense and different enough from other renditions of this dish I really felt I was eating something special. The rice noodles with pork and yellow beans were very good with a nice wok hei but the flavor could've used a bit more zazz. And the chian mai curry noodles was interesting though we felt a bit on the sweet side and you need to be preparred to navigate chicken bones and they end up in the dish--sorry I'm a bit lazy! We went for the mango with stick rice for dessert which I thought was well done--the rice was cooked just right and had a great flavor, the coconut sauce was savory and tasty and only the mangoes were actually not quite as good as they could've been. Though this is not my favorite Thai in Singapore (Jim Thompson) I'm not sorry I went and it's certainly something you should try if you want something good and a bit different than what you can get elsewhere. Lastly the prices I thought were reasonable for Singapore, a surprise
5
Long Chim delivers very well on its promise to serve great, authentic and fresh Thai street food.Service is very friendly and professional. If I had to point out an area, which could be improved, it would be the speed the food is coming out of the kitchen. The speed tends to be a bit slow - which I reckon is a sign that the food is freshly prepared.Recommendation: Try to visit Long Chim over lunchtime. The restaurant is not (yet) crowded and the lunch prices are good value for money

As soon as you enter the place, you know you are going to have a great night! The decor was cool but unpretentious, the atmosphere fun and and lively and the service was excellent. As you would expect from a restaurant associated with David Thompson, the food was nothing short of amazing. Thai food at its best, but don't expect street food prices - the bill will be punchy

Went with a party of 10. Ordered the 3 course set for lunch as I found it better value for money. Comes with free Thai milk tea if you pay with a Citibank card.The party ordered crab and duck fried rice, pad Thai, papaya salad with grilled chicken, beef noodles and fried noodles for mains. We found food good, kids were not complaining, that means food must be tasty as they're picky eaters, however, we found the noodles a tad too salty for our liking. We also had to wait rather long for our meals to be served, but since we were all enjoying each other's company, we didn't complain. We had mangoes with sticky rice and durian ice cream for dessert . The durian dessert is the best durian ice cream I've tasted, beats anything you find in any ice cream creamy

We ordered spring rolls, minced beef, pad thai and pork fritters. Remarks... very salty and small portion. Service is good.

Most of the food we ordered are good - beef skewer, chiang mai cabbage, tom yum, papaya salad, some noodles. Disappointing only is the grilled chicken which was too salty. Restaurant ambiance is very nice, we hot a very good table as we saw fireworks celebration of SG50. Service is very good

My first dinner in Singapore was at Long Chim. . . and I enjoyed it a lot.From the first bite og the aromatic beef skewers, to the last spoon og the durian Ice cream. The food here is packed with flavors in the right amount of spice. . . well done.The atmosphere there is fast , hectic but the waiters and barman are there and always ready for a chat, and help.I had a few non alcoholic drinks that was really good. I can highly recommend eating here

Fantastic Thai Street food Style restaurant, that despite being in a Shopping Centre, it had a great atmosphere, moody lighting and an open kitchen to watch. The portion sizes were generous, the food expertly cooked and presented, Wine was a good selection and reasonably priced by Singapore standards. the staff were delightful,they knew the menu, made good recommendations and added to an already very enjoyable experience. Highly recommended all round

Hosted a client lunch here last week. Went with high expectations but I have to say I left a little disappointed. The waitress who served us didn't seem very familiar with the menu at all and the food when it came, was to say the least underwhelming. Perhaps being new the kinks have yet to be ironed out. I will probably give it 6 months before trying it again. Service was pleasant throughout though

The Long Chim Thai restaurant is located in the impressive Marina Bay Sands complex. The restaurant food was very good and the service could not be faulted. The service from the friendly staff topped off a very nice visit to this restaurant. The restaurant itself is large but welcoming and the atmosphere is just right. The menu is comprehensive and the wait staff are attentive without being pushy. Price is not daunting and this is a restaurant you should try if looking for quality Thai food and all good service

Whenever I travel, I always find myself on the lookout for great dining experiences. It's hard to do the same in your own country, but if there was an experience that could transport me to another place, this would be it.The design of this place is based off a menu that takes its inspiration from Thai street food. Every surface is Bangkok street updated and uprated. I love it. Everything is just so smart. Casual and grungy enough to be comfortable yet still special and refined.The food portions are rather small, so you're gonna be paying more for the atmosphere than the food. Though the menu is authentic, it's just like the decor. Uprated. Who cares if it reminds you of the cheap eats on the streets of Bangkok? I'd much rather eat them with great ingredients in a great room like this

Hidden above Hermes is this gem of a restaurant. Relaxed casual dining with bursting flavours both food and cocktails! I've lived it Thailand for two years and I know good Thai food when I taste it! Jay, the bar manager resembles beautiful Thai flavours in his cocktail creations, which actually blew me away. The venue is perfect for a date or pre-party location with friends at the weekends (great options for sharing dishes)! My favourite part is the edgy vibe the restaurant has considering its location in swanky MBS, with Alex Face graffitis on the walls! (make sure to checkout the artwork in the disabled wc) Good job guys
5
I loved this restaurant! Although it took some time to find in the MBS from the moment we walked through the doors, it was AMAZING! Greeted with smiles, seated promptly, the ambience in the restaurant is luxury but friendly. The menu is extensive and dish after dish came out perfect and extremely tasty! The fish was so fresh and the staff were able to accommodate some of our more complicated orders. I def recommend this place

After being in Thailand for a few weeks in 2013 my new wife and I grew to love the cuisine. So for the first part of our honeymoon we decided to go to the heralded Long Chim. Firstly we don't mind atmospheric but the place was way too dark we couldn't even see our food. The cocktails were average and the food matched definitely nothing special & no twist on what we have eaten before. All in all a disappointing and costly experience for what is on offer
5
Second time now at Long Chim. Great bar with a solid cocktail list, and mains to die for. I've been to David Thompson's nahm restaurant in both London and in Bangkok, and actually I prefer the relaxed atmosphere and the dishes at Long Chim. Will become a regular favourite

This is wonderful Thai food with a slight difference.  So obviously it is a Western interpretation of Thai Food as the chef is a Celebrity Chef who is not from Asia. Even then, as far I am concerned the food was pretty good, still seemed Thai and highly recommended. Don't expect your normal green curry etc here - they mentioned a lot of the food is from Chagmai which may explain the different. We had a set menu as there were many of us - so there were appetisers and then the mains. Food was great. They had this lamb rendang dish that was very tender. There was this grilled fish that was moist and just amazing. The only issue was that we had a set menu and it was too much food. Service was good. Decor was interesting. Highly recommended.

I had been so looking forward to visiting this restaurant, having heard such good things and of course, it's a David Thompson venture. But I came away shaking my head, having had one of the most average Thai meals of my life (and I adore Thai food, have been to Thailand, and come from Sydney where we are lucky to have some amazing Thai restaurants).We tried the fishcakes and fried prawns. The fishcakes were average, no better really than your average old school Thai restaurant. Small serving, too bouncy and not a great deal flavour. The prawns could have been deep fried anything. Crispy batter was good. The chilli sauce accompanying them was the best thing about the dish. By this time we were a bit concerned but still excited for mains. We ordered the green beef curry with roti, 'Prins' noodles with pork and prawns and a stir fry of pork and long beans. Too much food but we wanted to try stuff.The noodles were good, but tasted very much like a standard (well executed) char kway teow which we can have anywhere at the hawker centres here (and have had some excellent versions). Not as much smokiness/char as you would want and light on the meat, but still nice.The beef curry was a complex sauce but it was SO SALTY as to be unpleasant. And I absolutely adore salt. I am the seasoning queen and I will eat foods that others deem too salty. But while I knew there was a really complex sauce in this dish, I simply couldn't taste it through the overpowering salt. And the roti, quite frankly, was a bit of a joke. Thick and tough, didn't seem freshly made.So then we still had hopes for the stir fry of pork. Nope. It was actually inedible due to the salt content (I am guessing way too liberal an application of fish sauce) and we had to send it back. They were gracious about it and took it off the bill.It cost just over 200SGD with 2 entrees, 2 mains and 2 glasses of pinot. We had to have 2 large bottles of sparking water to cope with the salt!! So not great value at all for what turned out to be such average food.The vibe was great; the room is lovely; the staff were attentive and concerned and the overall service was spot on. Pity about the food, in this town where it is often so difficult to eat badly, no matter where you are

Have been to Long Chim a few times now and it's definitely my favourite thai restaurant. Everything from the decor to the service to, of course, the food is second to none. Everything we had for dinner last night was outstanding, left us talking about when we will next be coming back.

David Thompson, the guru of Thai haute cuisine, has brought Thai street cuisine to Singapore. The food is terrific; indeed it is as good as it gets. Thompson's "secret" is the freshly ground fresh herbs and only quality ingredients. The pad thai with prawns, peanuts and been sprouts is the best I've ever had. We had it for dinner with a super fresh papaya salad and a very hot green curry wagyu beef. The meal was so good we came back for lunch the next day (when the menu is lighter and simpler albeit with some of Thompson's signature dishes). Long Chim an excellent wine list.

Pretty disappointed with the restaurant. The food is not great. Far better Thai food is available at a fraction of the cost. The atmosphere is interesting. Service is good , cocktails are excellent but the food "cannot make it"If you want good Thai food in Singapore try Thang Yin at the Amara hotel.

Celebrated Father's day and brother's birthday there. Food was surprisingly unimpressive considering it was touted as a celebrity restaurant. Tasted far better thai food in Bangkok. The green curry beef is the worst green curry I ever tasted. For the price they charge, I expect better food. The décor is simple. The table I had is so dark that I couldn't see what I am eating. The red plastic chairs outside the restaurant looks cheap and makes the place look as cheap as the chair. The red plastic chairs should go.Staff needs more training to be polished. I was appalled when one of them pushed my shoulder aside so she can place the food on the table. Otherwise, the staff are friendly.I certainly wouldn't be going again for the price they charge
5
The restaurant decor is really cool and modern and very inviting.We had dinner there and enjoyed the food and drinks tremendously. The dishes were authentic and spicy - just the way we like it! Would definitely come back for the food.The ambience was great too - a bit noisy at times - the music could be softer to enable patrons to hear each other talk.Staff seemed a bit busy and distracted at times - but still good service overall.

Went there on a Friday for a 9pm reservation.Great looking restaurant, bar, open kitchen and casual style dining room.I thought the food was too spicy. I can tolerate a bit of chilli (my significant other being a chilli junkie), however many of the dishes we ordered were too spicy for me, and almost hit the tolerance level for Mr Hot Stuff. The noodles with sriracha sauce were yummy though! I feel the menu should have a level of spice against the dishes to help guide diners / or staff advice.Drinks wise good selection, although pricey ($14 singha - that's how much 6 cost at the supermarket in Singapore).Music was a bit too nightclub for that time of that night. Although maybe the noisy chaos is what they're going for as part of the Thai street food vibe.Staff and service were ok - standard normal not great singapore service. Would not go back there for a meal - maybe for a drink and a snack

A nights stop over in Singers saw three of us ( all chefs) make a beeline for this Aussie chefs Thai venture in Singapore. We tried 6 dishes in total and all agreed that they all had great fresh flavours and were well prepared and presented, my two favourites were the " must try" beef skewers which bursted with flavour and the chicken feet hot and sour soup that show cased the kitchens abilities at their best. Great staff who treated us like old friends with a professional approach was just right for the style of restaurant here. One niggle would be the ridiculously over priced beer and wine list but this is Singapore and seems to be the rule ! Can't wait for this Aussie chef to open his new venture in my home town of Perth WA
4
We shared 3 entrees all delicious. The mains were bought out quickly, the service was prompt but not overbearing.
The 2 main courses were great. The green curry was amazing. The wine wasn't too badly priced considering this is Singapore.
5
great food. Highly rated. Oustanding Thai. Designer restaurant. Marina Bay Sands has many other appealing bars to go to before or after the meal.
3
We had dinner to celebrate a birthday. Food was not good, favours unbalanced and service was not attentive.
5
Made a booking for the night we arrived.Location was in the new Marina bay shopping precinct.It's self amazing.Staff very helpful,food hot and spicy.It's casual and very hip.Enjoyed our hot curries and spicy fried prawns.Very happy we made the effort after our trip from aus.Great tasting food,inexpensive,but delicious

This restaurant sits almost literally on top of the Marina Bay Sands Casino. The theme is Bangkok street food but I have never tasted such food- even in BKK! The green curry beef was extraordinary, the mixed plate of deserts was tantalizing and all washed down with a drinks menu that allowed you to indulge your fantasies. All of this while looking out over the harbour across to the Fullerton on the other side. I was fortunate to be with two locals who knew the menu very well. Has to be one of Singapore's great restaurants

We ventured out to Long Chim today for a family dinner with high expectations after reading a good review on TimeOut and have come back sorely disappointed with equally sore stomachs from the unbalanced flavours, liberal overuse of chillies as well as salt. Judging from the last 5 reviews on here, this is definitely not a once off and seems to be a recurring theme..While the starters of fish cake, beef skewers and spicy chicken in lettuce were very good palate teasers, the mains except for the grilled Salted Fish seemed to be just one disaster after the other. The squid stirfry was the first to arrive overly salted, poor squid tendrils and with an overpowering flavour that seemed to be tamarind - this was promptly replaced by our kind server with an alternative Pad Thai that was delicious but over laden with chillies( and we are chilli lovers). Next up the kailan with crispy pork was neither crispy nor edible due to an incredibly over-salted combination of oyster and soya sauce - which was again replaced with a slightly less salty version of the same. The papaya salad and soft shell crab curry that followed were passable. Being a somewhat amateur chef myself, I fail to understand how a kitchen supposedly trained under David Thompson can churn out such poor quality - either nobody is tasting the food during prep or there are severe issues in the kitchen - the overuse of salt, liberal scatterings of green chillies, whole garlic cloves punctuated the unbalanced flavours. While I did notice a head chef tasting dishes once they were sent back, overall it seems that the dishes are being churned out without a thought to taste, texture and quality - hardly representative of what we know of David Thompson and definitely not representative of fantastic Bangkok Street fare

Was there with 5 girlfriends for dinner last evening. V expensive Thai street food that was way too salty and not much Thai flavour! ($600) Fish soup was dished out but when we all had one mouthful and realized it's almost like drinking fish sauce, we sent it back but no replacement or apologies or was it taken off our bill. Most of the other dishes were left half finished but no one was interested in our comments. We all left hungry and decided to get a burger at DB! The only plus factor is a good bar man, Longa, who was great at his job and made wonderful cocktails. Pity - we would have spent more on cocktails if the food was edible

Finally i am here to try Long chim. We were curious how different us this place from the rest of the ultra luxe neighbouring restaurants as well as other thai restaurants in singapore. First thing i noticed is the dark interior of the place. Open concept kitchen and the dining area is zen like.. The selection on menu is extensive. Some are less common while others are the common thai food we all know of. We tried the tomyum fish soup, beef rice noodles, curry crab and fish cakes and banana pancakes for desserts.Curry softshell crab tasted good but we were disappointed that there was more spring onions than crabs. We asked for tom yum soup to be done " medium spicy" . This turned out well.thai fish cakes were fresh and bouncy. Fried Beef rice noodles was a bit uninque. The taste did not go well with us. The beef pieces were good but somehow the stong bitter taste was not what we were looking for in this dish. There 2was no lemon grass tea? Thinking that all thai restaurants will have this drink.i would say this is 3/4 thau + 1/4 creative fushion. Price is reasonable considering the fact that its top chef helms nahm in thailand..

Love this place - best Thai in Singapore in my opinion. especially of you want the true spice, sour and sweet balance that Thai is known for. Some Thai is overly sweet - not this.Some really fine food and also a great drinks menu - some great cocktails.Was also great to see David Thompson, the Chef, in the restaurant, overseeing things (see photo). He is a great Thai Chef.Will be back here when I return to Singapore next
4
We went here at 6pm and got seat at the kitchen counter (we were told the restaurant was fully booked but for the 2.5 hours we were there, it didn't seem that way!). The food was great though, really tasty, and our waiter was brilliant. Looking forward to going again!
5
Great location, extraordinary environment and decoration, awesome food, fantastic ambience! Probably the best Thai restaurant in Singapore.. David Thomspon rocks!
3
Too much Thai spices. Walked away with a mouthful of mixed spices that was an overdose to the taste palate. Restaurant was too dark to see what we were eating. For reservations, we had to push hard to get a seat.
4
The ambience was fantastic with great attention to detail from the great tiles to lighting. Loved the starters more than the mains but oh so thankful for another Great Thai restaurant. Great cocktails as well. Will definitely be back

One of the "celebrity chefs" restaurants at MBS. Nice atmosphere, a bit street-style, relaxed and comfortable. Had beef skewers for starters and charcoaled noodles with beef as main course, ginger ale for drinks. Watching how noodles were cooked and flamed was part of the experience - and chef did a good job on this one :) Dish was subtly spicy and delicious though the beef was rather chewy which I would not expect in such a place.If you fancy Thai food with a little twist in a comfy and bit stylish setting Long Chim is certainly the place to go at MBS. Value for is alright.

We chose to sit at the kitchen bar for our meal at David Thompson's new restaurant Long Chim and were very pleasantly surprised to discover David himself and his head chef Ommo (from Nahm in Bangkok - voted Asia's number 1 in the top 50 restaurants 2014) cooking up a storm and recipe testing. We love to cook so for us it was a real treat. We enjoyed the Green wagyu curry which will knock your socks off so if chilli is not your thing, talk to the very helpful floor staff to guide you in a milder direction. There is a very harmonious and respectful vibe between all the staff here which was a joy to behold. Definitely no ego's flying out of the kitchen at Long Chim

There are many amazing dishes that you almost never find in any Thai restaurant either in or outside the country. But you would find them at stalls in small alleys in Thailand, for no more than 50 Baht per serving. We had several memorable dishes: Miang Kham (dried prawns with ginger, toasted coconut and betel leaves - amazing!); long eggplant and steamed duck egg salad (a break from your usual beef, green mango or papaya salads); sour orange fish curry (a curry without coconut milk); stir-fried squid with chillies, green peppercorn and basil (I wonder how any ang mo could finish such a spicy dish); a Thai char kway teow so oozing in multiple flavours that David Thompson had to fry it himself! Leave room for the durian ice cream, which is arguably better than the fruit. In Vietnamese, Lồng Chim means 'bird cage', and the décor does evoke a cage; it represents the dark Bangkok alleys underneath all the neon lights. But in Thai, Long Chim means 'Come and try' - we tried and will certainly go back
5
At last Singapore has a great Thai place serving the real thing.Now it is finally fully open I have been five times.The menu changes often and the waiters really know what to recommend.Everyone is on their game here and it is by far the best place and best value to eat at MBS.Do try the mashed prawn curry and grilled beef with cumin if they are on the menu.The phad thai is outstanding too.David Thompson is rightly recognized as the guru of Thai cooking and this places is a great example.A short but good wine list also enhances the tip top cooking in a really buzzy and friendly atmosphere.Destined for many awards I think
5
I beg to differ from some reviews that the food was not of good & fresh quality & tasted yuck! This is certainly not what we experienced this evening at Long Chim. While it may not be atypical street food offering, it's interpretation is definitely many notches higher in terms of quality & taste especially the Pad Thai, it's one of the best I've tasted outside Bangkok, I might even say that it holds a class of its own. We thoroughly enjoyed the starters of prawn cakes, betel leaf wraps, fried prawns, warm vermicelli salad & mains of grilled fish, vermicelli with baked prawns, mashed prawn curry & green beef curry ... ending with the amazing dessert of banana rosti, coconut cake, mango sticky rice, black glutinous rice with coconut milk unfortunately the durian ice cream was not available. It has been one great experience and we will be definitely back for more! Chef David Thompson is still trying his best to settle his team in as we watched him personally at work this evening. He was absolutely hands on and it is incredible to see him hard at work
5
Maybe it was because of David Thomson's presence in the kitchen, but this was seriously the best Thai food I've found so far in the Lion City. Spices were exactly on point with what they should have been and the food was overall very well balanced. Have to go there again some time
2
With raving reviews in the press and being awarded No. 7 spot on San Pellegrino's Asia's 50 Best Restaurants 2015, we decided to give this place a try. The conclusion was just advertising gimmicks. The food were generally not of good and fresh quality and they tried to hide it with strong flavours and seasoning. Other than their fancy seasoning, any street food can beat this place
