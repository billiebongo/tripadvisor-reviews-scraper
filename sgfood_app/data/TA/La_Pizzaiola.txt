I love their pizza! I had better Spaghetti else where. Do make reservation before coming as they are usually full house. Food served was prompt.
5
The bruschetta is very unique & tasty. Ravioli truffle excellent!!!! Lava cake excellent. Service staff Danna & Tracy very helpful. Good job chefs! V v tasty food! Def come back!
4
brought my Taiwan friend to try and she loved the food (pizza and seafood linguini). Service was awesome, very friendly staff but the place was stuffy.. maybe due to sitting at the table nearest to the wall.
3
I ordered a Margherita and it came with only two leaves of basil (cut in half to look like 4 pieces) and no fresh mozzarella (see pic). i.e. it was a cheese pizza, not a Margherita!
It tasted ok, but it come on now...
5
Had the seafood pasta and the black truffle ham pizza (special of the day). The seafood pasta was quite good with good size portion of seafood. However, the black truffle ham pizza was simple delight. The black truffle simply accentuated the simple taste of the ingredients of the pizza. One of the best ever taste
3
Had the seafood spaghetti and black truffle pizza with bacon here. Had better pasta elsewhere so it was decent but not wow. The highlight was definitely the pizza, and they allow for takeaways too. This joint is popular with the expat crowd and offers up a decent wine list.
5
This is one of my favourites.The do the staple pasta, diavola pizzas, etc. well.The house red is at a very affordable S$45 a bottle.It can get very busy and hence hard to get table. Try to be there early (6 or 6.30pm) if you don’t have a reservation.The servers are excellent too
4
My family and I went to La Pizzaiola for dinner on a Sunday night. Good thing we had a reservation - the place was packed! We had the special - truffle pizza - delicious! A la carte items were all good. My personal favorite - pizza! Bread dough was nice and chewy. Ambience-wise, the acoustics in the restaurant weren’t good and it was quite noisy. Staff were helpful and prompt in service. We were generally quite happy with our dinner there. Found prices a little high for the fact that the restaurant is located in a private housing estate. Would recommend to try it out.

I hate to say it but I think most of the reviewers on this one probably have never eaten good Italian food if they are giving this place 4 or 5 stars, I'm being generous at a 2. Staff are great, we'll start there but then the positives end. Took me 3 tries to get a bottle of wine, my other choices they don't have, on a limited wine list that's pretty poor.The ravioli was grim, had to have been frozen pre-made, definitely not fresh made in house. Pizza bases quite doughy. Bolognese tasteless and bland, didn't even resemble a true Bolognese more like spaghetti with tinned sauce thrown on top.Nope, won't be returning to this mes
2
Took my family in with my mum who was visiting. We had been here before when we lived in the area but been some time since we have been back, I think it might have changed management. Ordered some Parma ham with rocket, got 4 miserly pieces of ham, for $23 It's quite a rip off plus they paired it with a $41 burata! Kids got Bolognese, tasted bland and almost as if from a jar, my son loves Bolognese but only ate maybe 4 mouthfuls of this. Mum had spinach ravioli, to me it tasted like frozen pre-made pasta, probably was. I had lamb ragu fettuccine, I don't know what was going on here. Minced lamb that tasted like Shepards pie mince put on pasta. Inedible only way to describe it. Didn't see any Italian looking chefs in this joint, Chinese only. Only real redeeming feature was the wait staff who were very pleasant. Definitely won't be revisiting.
5
This is my go-to pizzeria in Singapore. I usually have the 4 cheese pizza but have also tried other pizzas, risotto, and mozzarella dishes and was never disappointed.
As good as in Italy!
4
Pizza's crust was nicely baked. I had Quattro formaggi and got garlic added on top. Tasted pretty good. Not having Jalapenos as an ingredient was a miss. Chocolate cake with ice cream was also very tasty. It is not the best I had but taste of pizza is surely worth to visit from time to time. It has a friendly setting with friendly staff
5
Great little hidden away place. A friend recommend this lovely pizza place, I would have never find it otherwise .Must say, it was very good. Pizza - yummy! Pasta - yummy! Wine - good! There is playground behind this pizza restaurant, so kids can go wild before and after pizza.Staff was very lovely and attentive
4
First visit here and it proved to be good! We ordered their eggplant as starter. And it was surprisingly nice although I think it wrote as "eggplant salad". It's more like stewed eggplant. Plus we ordered special dishes of the day: 1 black truffle with bacon pizza1 scallop in cream linguineThe pizza was a tad too salty. Luckily the cream linguine was a good complement. Lastly, we ordered two desserts (as shown in photos). Tiramisu was so-so. Not as good as those in Italy. But the other chocolate dessert was good! Just a bit pricey.A pity they don't serve bread before dinner like in Italy. All in all, we spent about $90. Not a super cheap place. But we enjoyed the food. Plus it was in a quiet estate. So thumbs up for this! (:
3
We went to this restaurant on a friend recommendation. We were disappointed.First, we ordered the eggplant appetizer to share, it's really good but it's a very saucy dish and we were not given any bread and upon asking, it cost 10+ dollar to get bread. In an Italian restaurant this is not very generous. For the main dish we had their special pizza which was very good.We also had the carbonara pasta and there, very disappointed to see that it was a very heavy cream sauce, whereas a true Italian carbonara is a light cheese and egg sauce only. This pasta dish was very below average for the price and the statement of traditional Italian restaurant. The room is slightly noisy. Some good, notably the pizza, some bad but for the price we will not come back.
4
It may be just a suburban restaurant but the meal I was served was excellent. The rocket,tomatoes and mozzarella in the Caprese salad was so fresh I thought I was in an italian michelan star place. The steamed ocean fish was superbly cooked. Definately a keeper
3
Ordered squid ink linguine and a rucola parma pizza. I've always had high expectations of squid ink linguine and have always benchmarked against what I had when in Venice. As expected, like all the rest of the squid inks I've tried, this one fell way short. And so when my pizza arrived, I had high hopes. The pizza was full of Parma ham with some rucola leaves dressed on top. Taste wise, was ok. Nothing to blow my mind away. Would I come back again? Most probably not since I have a few favourites to satisfy my pizza cravings. Good points? Good service and really fast to serve.
5
Just arrived on the morning of Valentine's Day and was lucky to be informed that a table will be available after 815pm.Was lead to the high table which was perfect. Our server, didn't catch the name, the bubbly bespectacled girl was great! She sold us the mozzarella with arugula and tomatoes as the caprese was sold out.Each of us had individual pastas which to my surprise for a Neighbourhood restaurant cooked better then the higher end ones. I had spinach ravioli with butter and sage, generous on the sage! My Son had the penne with salmon mousse, delicious! Wifey had spaghetti frutti de mare. It was a wonderful experience! Will be back to try out the pizzas! Molto bene, grazie
3
Other than the great level of service, we were not blown away by the quality of the food. What is 'bacon' on their special pasta of the day was actually pork belly pieces which was a bit weird on aglio olio pasta. I would recommend you give that a miss.The squid ink pasta is actually not cooked with squid ink but using black ink pasta. This move is usually not as authentic and of course while we may appear fussy over this, it should be really be classified correctly.The pizza was OK. Although I think the crust remained a little doughy. (But not a big deal breaker).Would have liked to be impressed as it is near my home but was would not be revisiting. Price is OK and they were generous in ingredients but not portions. For example, loads of tomatoes and pork belly for not too much pasta
4
Each visit to La Pizzaiola is always enjoyable and satisfying. The combination of casual atmosphere, friendly staff and great food never fails to make it a fun evening out for us. The buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto salad is an excellent start followed by thin-crust pizza, pastas and the tenderest Osso Bucco around. Finish off with tiramisu or panna cotta with an Italian coffee. We'll be back soon
4
The pizza's here are well prepared and tasty. We also tried the pasta's, they were ok only. Service was average only.
5
Here with family to celebrate Nephew Birthday. Great food especially the pizza and pasta! Please remember to book as I noticed is full house.
5
Enjoyed this place for Italian food. The pizzas and bread are all oven-baked and fresh. Great time for family meals and located in an exclusive environment.
5
I have come here multiple times and have never been disappointed. Staff is friendly and good choice of pizza and pasta menu. If you like to try a smaller Italian restaurant in Singapore try this one.
4
Loved their Spinach Ravioli, Freindly staff. Should include more options for Vegetarians. and more options with Chicken.
Over all a good exp with awesome food and drinks.
a bit Pricey.
Prior reservation recommended.
5
If you are looking for fresh Italian pizza and pasta and you happen to be around Serangoon and Braddell Heights, do check out this cosy restaurant snug in the middle of a landed residential area! Besides a good selection of Italian cuisine (the ravioli and breads are excellent!), they also clearly mark out which are the vegetarian dishes! Service is great and attentive! Parking is along the residential roads right outside the row of shop houses. Walking either from Lor Chuan or Serangoon MRT stations take between 10-15mins. Excellent experience!

Was introduced to this restaurant by my wife. She had a meetup there and was certain that I will like the pizzas served. Turned out that she is right!Went there around 12.30pm on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant is not easy to locate as it is in the midst of a private estate. You may want to check the map first before heading down. I was lucky to get a lot directly outside the restaurant.Restaurant was fairly populated when we entered. We were served by this young waitress who seemed really eager to take our order. We went ahead with the truffle bacon and blue cheese pizzas. I enjoyed both pizzas very much but I preferred the truffle pizza as they were really generous with the truffle. Nearing the end, we were struggling to finish the pizzas as the flavours were really intense. I was thankful for the lime juice that I had ordered which made finishing my portion much easier.Will definitely return but will try not to be as greedy during the next visit
5
We prefer the outlet at Kalidasa Ave. Not a very extensive menu of pasta and pizza offerings but sufficient variety for a family meal. Food is tasty. We have been there many times and have yet to be disappointed. Service is good too. What's not to like
4
Pizza and pasta dishes are very popular in this casual diner. Prices were reasonable and service was attentive. We had seafood spaghetti and cheese pizza, spaghetti was served al dente with very fresh prawns and squid. Pizza was done to perfection with a bland of 4 types of cheese! A lively casual dining spot with great tasting Italian cuisine . Check it out when you are around the Bartley road area
2
Let's start with a positive- friendly and really nice staff. That's all... The food I ordered had a really poor presentation. The portion- really small. I usually don't eat much but I left hungry. Taste- not bad, normal I guess. But if you crave for a delicious lasagna with melted and baked cheese on the top- that's not the place for you. Prices- as usual in Singapore- overpriced!
4
Thin based pizzas. Menu fairly gourmet. No supreme. Playground out the back. Located mid island about 7 mins walk from Serangoon and Lorong Chuan MRTs.
4
Hard to find but worth finding - great Italian food, but dessert portions are ridiculously small for the price.
3
Place is good, atmosphere ok but a little bit noisy. On the food aspect I took spaghetti Di Mare. The dish was not good and seems not fresh (smell not so good ...). The quatity is too small.Disappointed by this restaurant, I'm not recommend it 
4
Excellent pizza, good service and reasonable prices. Appreciate that the wines are not ridiculously marked up. Ambience is good, with the high tables my favourite. Only issue is the noise levels....when the restaurant is full on the weekends, the acoustics are not good - hence enjoy the excellent pizza during the week!
5
Normally Italian food in Singapore is expensive, but I have been here a few times and always enjoy their La Pizzaiola specialty, the pizza, stater, everything was nice. You should try the chocolate lava mountain cake. 1 is not enough for me. The prices very competitive and not so expensive. The staff is really nice and good
4
Dining in this country can be very expensive indeed so one needs to find a medium somewhere and La Pizzaiola does it for me. It's not dirt cheap like a hawkers centre but it is not as high as some of the places around MBS. It's no secret from my reviews I'm Italian and this is the 1st place I choose to go for that. So for me it's the Burratina, Pizza Parma and Ruccola with extra Parma and a secret dessert I know about that is not on the menu. Pastas are nice but the portions could be bigger. Very sad though that the slim Indian man who used to welcome us and knew what wine I wanted and recognised my voice on the phone, is no longer there...Absolute shame. Still my favourite place to go in Singapore for a night out and if you are close by, order a Pizza to take away. Owner operator is Italian and the atmosphere is great
3
Been here a few times and always enjoy their La Pizzaiola speciale, with thin slices of delectable roast beef with truffle oil. The base is slightly thick, so much so that sometimes it is difficult to cut it, but the pizza slices are flavourful. We also ordered their pasta special for the day, with minced meat in truffle oil and a cream sauce. When the plate arived, we could smell the aromatic and strong taste of truffle oil but, unfortunately, the dish did not live up to its initial promise. While it was cooked well, al dente, it was rather bland. We actually had to add salt and a dash of pepper. Service was very good, as usual
4
Located in a small enclave in a quiet estate of private landed houses, this gem is a great find. The food is great and the prices very decent. They serve fantastic pizza and pasta. I tried the seafood pasta but asked them to change the tomato based sauce to white wine sauce and it was awesome. The truffle pizza smelt strong and good, but wasn't overpowering. The gnocchi, which I stole a bit from my friend, was great. There were 11 of us, we all ordered different things plus some more, and I tried a bit of most of the dishes, and none of them disappointed. The ambience and service were great too, by the way. Overall, I enjoyed it and will go there again.
4
My first time to visit this restaurant at Jalan Riang. Nestled right in the quiet neighbourhood of Teacher's estate is where you will find this awesome home-made pizza and pasta place. Lucky we have made table reservation. Was quite crowded after 6 pm. Food were great. We had a seafood pizza, squid ink pasta, tiramisu etc. It is nice to find an authentic Italian food near the neighborhood area instead need to travel to town. They also dun charge for water. Staff were quite friendly but can be better.
4
My family and I visit la pizzaiola relatively regularly as it is one of our favorite family places in Singapore. We have found the quality of food to be consistently good for great value - this is VERY rare in Singapore. Additionally, the staff is super nice and attentive and we always have a great experience. I also love the atmosphere and neighborhood which is quiet and away from the busyness of Orchard Rd. and other main shopping districts. La Pizzaiola also has a legitimate pizza oven and they also have Italian beer for an incredibly reasonable price as all alcohol is very expensive in Singapore. We will be back and continue to visit LP while in Singapor
3
I sometime go there for lunch with friends and we appreciate the place, the service and the food.
Pizza and pasta are good and they have affordable wine ( considering Singapore price level) to go with.
The staff is nice and friendly,
1
La Pizzaiola - Teacher's Estate outlet - is one of my 3 favourite restaurants in S'pore. I've always loved its friendly and warm service. Sadly, the La Pizzaiola branch at Braddell Heights Estate is at the other end of the spectrum where service is concerned. My 2 colleagues and I went to the Braddell Heights Estate branch in end Oct Monday as the Teacher's Estate branch closes on Mondays. We ordered warm and ice water. The waitress brought 1 pot of warm water and a flask of ice water, put them on the table and walked off. We pay 10% service charge and have to pour water ourselves throughout our meals ??!! The waitress took our orders, repeated it and still got it wrong : served the pizza as a main course when we specifically said it was to be served as an appetizer and forgot my friend's entrÃ©e.She knew we were not happy about the orders and offered us coffee after we paid our bill. We declined. If she were sincere in offering us coffee on the house as an apology, she should have asked us before we paid the bill, not after. I will never go back there again; I'll stick with the Teacher's Estate outlet
3
Pizzas are quite value for money, though the rest of the items aren't exactly cheap. But considering it's famous for its pizza, i'll give it a thumbs up. Try the roast beef pizza, it's probably the best pizza they have amongst many.However, my visit was kind of scared by one chef. As I stood by the pasta station and observed the chef, I noticed he used one 'good morning' cloth to wipe his hands, clean the plate and then placed it on the kitchen top, then used it to hold the pan. I don't scare easily, but I found it rather amusing as I told the other guests to avoid the pasta.I'll stick to the pizzas
4
We went on a Friday lunch and tables were easily available. Walking past the other tables of diners, it was obvious that the pizza is a must try. I ordered the La Pizzaiola special with the sliced roast beef topping. Nicely done pizza crust and more than sufficient portion for one. They should have smaller pizza sizes for the typically smaller lunch diner. My friend had the Ravioli Ricotta,which was good too, tho presentation could have been enhanced with some chopped parsley at least for a color contrast.Parking around the housing estate must be quite a nightmare for both diners and residents at peak hours, so be patient with tha
4
Restaurant has a open kitchen and pizza oven to prepare classic Italian dishes. Dishes on the menu include pastas, pizzas, as well as a variety of meat lovers and vegetarians. Good pizza and pasta, we ordered risotto too, it's refreshing and creamy. Even the bake bread itself from the pizza oven, to dip it into olive oil is so good. The only thing here it is just not very easy to access by public transport. You can take a cab in from Serangoon mrt.
4
If you want good, authentic Italian food in a cosy setting with attentive friendly service crew to boot, this is the restaurant to check out. Especially love the pizza with its generous toppings and thin crust. The chicken stew, which is sufficient for 2 persons to share, is also highly recommended. And do complete the meal with their lava cake with vanilla ice-cream. Bliss! Another plus point about this restaurant is that they serve plain water - complimentary. Will definitely come back for the delicious food and great service
4
Our usual neighbourhood hunt for easy Italian food. The food is truly authentic and enjoyable. Service was great. The only complaint was probably small pasta portions sizes and the mushroom soup was costly at $9.90 for that small portion.But will be back, we love them
4
We had 3 dishes like Pizza Bresaola, Mushroom Soup & Clams Fettuccine Pasta! Was recommended by the staffs on the food selection. They tasted great and we were also very satisfied with their crew service, highly professional & polite. Great to dine here, was highly recommended by my spouse and we really had a wonderful evening! 1 thing to note, pls rem to call up to do a reservation first as it's pretty crowded during dinner time and you can easily not get a seat. I am sure you don't want to feel disappointed right? Btw car parking is another issue. Pls park your cars further because there's not much lots outside. Or take a cab alright!! That's all folks!! Feel free to drop me a message if required, I will glad to help
4
Went here recently for dinner. The Burratina con Prosciutto Crudo, as noted by others, is excellent. MAKE SURE YOU ORDER IT! We also had the Focaccia all'Aglio e Olio which was not that good, quite dry, and the salsa verde that came with it was very strange tasting. I tried drenching mine in olive oil but it didn't help much. My husband had a pizza which looked and tasted amazing. I had the sausage ravioli which wasn't great. Maybe stick to pizza. Great meal though and will definitely be back. They do takeaway as well and as I'm local that's where I'll be getting my pizza from
4
This place certainly has a good standard of Italian food. Their pastas are well made with delicious sauces. Do check with them on their special pastas of the day as these are usually the good eats for a meal. The service is decent too with staff being alert even during peak hours
4
Been to the 2 branches and both serve extremely lovely Italian food in a cozy setting. The one in teacher's estate isn't as crowded as the one in Jalan Riang so very nice to go there for lunch after Sunday church...nice wines too and service at both locations wonderful!!! Can get crowded on the weekends so remember to make a booking:)
3
I live in the neighbourhood and I used to come at least 3 times/ months. It is now the third time I go and I think "disappointing". I think last Sunday was my last time... from the uncooked calzone pizza, the ridiculous side on the steack (and the quality of the meat, average), the average service, the AC very cold, the very noisy environment... Unless I am straving I will not go back and prefer other options or in NEX (400m from there), or in the city center (there are so many good pizzerias in singapore)! Bye Bye La Pizzaiola 
4
On our last day and after several days of yusheng and steamboat, we wanted some Italian food.The family's uanimous choice was to come here. Our starters included 2 plates of burratina Parma. The mozzarella was nice, but the portions seem to have shrunk, especially the salad. We also had sauteed mussels, which were tasty and not rubbery.We also went with our usual pizza - the La Pizzaiola - of smoked beef and truffle oil, though the truffle was noticeably lighter in taste this time. For pasta, we had tagliatelle with crab, linguine with spicy salsa, ravioli sausage, and fettucine with bacon done in carbonara style, which was my favourite dish of the night. The only disappointment, if you could call it that, was the foccacia bread. For S$7.90 for a small plate, it was rather tasteless even with the pesto and salsa dips.Service was excellent, a good mix of friendliness and efficiency. Prices were also reasonable - a meal of 4 starters, 2 pizzas and 4 pasta dishes was around S$225, excluding desserts and wine. Parking could,be a problem, especially on weekends, so arrive early. Also, make a reservation as it can get crowded
5
Service was excellent and prompt. One of the staff did come to our table and ask if the food is alright. Ordered the pasta of the day and it was a wonderful surprise! The pizza is good as well. Great ambiance and would love to visit again
4
decided to explore another side of Serangoon besides Serangoon Garden. got to take a short walk since we go by bus. A little suspicious at first cause we are walking along houses and have a little doubt there are restaurants as stated.finally come to a stretch of restaurants and found La Pizzaiola!good and friendly service and the food are top notch! The baked eggplant, the La Pizzaiola specialty pizza, ravioli and the tiramishu! everything is good!got to explore the rest of the restaurants nearby in near future but if we are craving for pizza, we know where to go now
3
Tuck in a quiet neighborhood . This is my first visit. Was impressed with the bruschetta as the fillings are not even spread round the pizza base. The angel hair with bacon and mushroom was badly cooked. Noodle was so soft and soggy that it looks like a bowl of mess. I had the beef Tenderloin n it came with few a potato pcs and some rockets with no dressing. The meat was rather bland too. We also had their special of the day pasta that has minced sausage. It looks like mee pok dried . Taste again was bland. The mixed platter was gd but again the Mozzarella has no dressing to it. One thing that I enjoyed was the parmigiana on the mixed platter. I think the platter is over priced.
4
tucked away in a nice little corner of the city. might be a little difficult to find unless you have GPS or a super knwledgeable taxi driver. dont think it is well connected by public transport.the ambience is very nice. food was good - tasted well. portion sizes were generous. all the dishes were a little different but that added to the taste. service was very nice. we did not have the pizzas but went for the general secondi stuff. prices are not bad but not rock bottom also. can tend to get quite full especially on weekends - would suggest reserving in advance.would certainly repeat
5
Having just moved to the neighborhood, we wanted to try the local eateries. This place was great. The pizzas were $16 and were large and used good ingredients (the kids loved them). The specials were plenty and tasty too. We will make this place a frequent stop
4
I live in the area so I go very often to this restaurant as I have found a great pizzeria ! Pizza is very good (the tomato base could be more tasty...), but the pizza base is good and even if they do not have a wood oven, it is well cooked. Once I had the calzone, I was very disappointed ! Also price are reasonnable (around 16-18) for a pizza, we had a steak once that was good but more pricy (around 24$) and served with 2 potatoes and a leaf of salad. I have never tried pasta as I can make them at home but they look nice. Tiramisu is good, affogato as well. A terrace is missing....Overall, service is good. I would stick to my quattro stagione but will come back often to this place because I live close by. Of course there is no point going there if you don't (also parking looks to be the hell!)
5
The pizzas are really excellent, while the lasagna and gnocci al pesto are fantastic. It's a casual place with a great service, extremely friendly, and the food comes quickly, which is a plus when you visit the restaurant with famished kids!Probably one of the best Italian restaurant in the Serangoon area
4
Good service and great tasting Italian food - it is a good combination! Staff are friendly and helpful, they are alway packed, or try to go early. Good portions too.
5
My family and I have easily been to this restaurant 25 times at least. We always like the food, with the pizza and pasta all very tasty and of excellent quality. This is just a great casual italian restaurant in a very off the beaten path location.Note, Pizzaiola has had some turnover in their staff. Two long time staffers mysteriously left (Roger and Aziz). We are hoping the new staff members can come close to maintaining the excellent atmosphere
4
This restaurant is in a row of shops down a side street in Upper Thomson. I am not sure how you could find out about it unless you were told to go there, as we were. The service is fantastic and the food is delicious. The reason for loss of a point in the rating is because I think the menu could offer a bit more variety. If you are not a fan of mushrooms the menu is limited
4
Surprising oy find a gem in the neighbourhood with free parking! The little Italian place served nice range of home wines too. The portion size was just right and was yummy. My brother who mostly likes Chinese meal paid a compliment to the meal, so that says something! Piazzas were thin crusts and tasty made in a huge piazza oven! Original!
4
Was at serangoon area and decided to turn into Jalan Riang where the row of shophouses have some interesting eateries. Decided to have Italian since it was not so crowded. Service was friendly and attentive. Ordered the Parma ham pizza and didn't fancy any of the pasta on the menu so asked if they can do change the creamy mushroom and sundries tomato pasta to alio olio style instead. They were very obliging and agreed. The pizza crust was thin and have a chewy bite and overall balanced taste. Pasta which was angel hair was overcooked like soggy instant noodles which should not happen in an Italian restaurant. But service was so warm that one tends to be more forgiving. Also ordered a takeaway pizza plus 2 cappuccino and total bill came to just over S$70 which I thought was reasonable. Will be back again
4
We came by slightly before 12 and didn't realise that it was almost fully booked! The waitress was nice enough to offer us a table and we had a great time! The pizza was fantastic and the pasta was wonderful! It was just enough for both of us to share. What's a little unique is that they give a bottle of water for the table so that you can serve yourself! Will definitely come again! (But do note, parking can be tough as this is found in a private estate!
4
Been searching for a decent pizza in Singers for 4 years, and found it in our backyard. This is a little out of the way in a strip shopping area, but well worth hunting up. Not much parking space, but as we walk there, it's not an issue for us. Book ahead as its busy in the evening. Staff were friendly, efficient and the Maitre'd (owner?) wonderful
4
I used to find hard to find good pizza in Singapore. I finally got one!! The pizza is served in a wooden try that is quite nice and it remained crusty from the beginning to the end. Quality of ingredients are also very good and the choice of wines too. It is a very convenient place for meeting clients or an after-work dinner
5
I ate here twice and both times the food and service were terrific. My husband and I ordered a pizza, salad and pasta to share. The waiter kindly put our pasta in two bowls. The ravioli was really fresh with a nice sauce. The Parma ham pizza is fantastic. The risotto is also really good. We ate dinner on the late side, 930, but the staff was attentive and cheerful. Keep up the good work la pizzaiola
4
The pizzas were good and the restaurant lovely and modern. In a residential aera parking can be a problem but valets help. We enjoyed the simple meal, ther remind wine by the glass was very good. The, I assue owner, was friendly and attentive. Overall worth a visit
4
Pasta is freshly made and taste good. They also have a great self-rotating pizza oven. Tiramisu is good and above average.
5
Loved the starters, pizzas, pasta....basically everything. Think the manager was the owner and he was a lot of fun. I think he had more of a blast teasing the kids about their I pods and their food orders.
4
Located near to Nexx shopping center in a surprisingly hip,fashionable and somewhat hidden locale. Worth a visit for the pizzas. The tiramisu was only so so though. The coffee is not bad. Finding parking proved to be a bit of a problem.
1
had a horrible service experience there today. Service staff really need some customer service training
4
I have been here a couple of times with work colleagues for lunch. Had not heard about the place till very recently. It's tucked in a quiet corner along with a few other joints.The ambiance is quite nice and its not very crowded during lunch hours.I've had their starters, pizza and pasta and all three were very good. I'm a vegetarian so not sure about non-veg. options but my colleagues seemed to like it.They also serve drinks here.Service was good, we didn't face any issues.I guess we will keep going there once in a while as its close to my office
4
This place is crowded and parking is hard to find. We made a reservation but had to give up the table in 1.5 hours. Although most of us were late and called in to update the restaurant, there was no pressure from the staff. The dishes came quite quickly and we were done with dinner in about 30 mins! Unfortunately I didn't really know which was my favorite dish. Would be back here again. Hopefully I will find a dish that like
4
Ordered garlic bread, house salad and four pizzas. The staff is very attentive. The pizza is very good. Thin crust and wood fired. The crust is not thin like a cracker, but has some chewiness and bite to it. I liked it. I had the arugula and parma ham. Lots of arugula. Best to get reservations. The restaurant was turning people away that didn't have them. The prices are very reasonable for Singapore. S$ 16 for a pizza of this quality is very good. Parking is limited, so you should take a taxi or walk from the closest MRT

A friend introduced this place to me recently. On arrving at the place, I was pleasantly surprised by how much Jalan Riang has changed. What used to housed a dilapidated coffee shop and simple bakery has been transformed into a quaint row of eatery tucked in the middle of this private estate.The food is good and the wines are good for pairing with the food though limited in range. I like the open-kitchen concept in which the customers are able to see how their food is being prepared through the glass. As the name of restaurant revealed, it is very good with its pizza. Definitely a place which I will take family there for dinner

Pizzaiola is a bustling little restaurant backing onto a playground in the quiet residential area of Braddell Heights. The nearest MRT is Lorong Chuan or Serangoon. We eat there regularly and reservations are recommended, as it does get very busy especially on Friday or Saturday nights. The staff are pleasant and friendly, but can get very frazzled at peak times, so do double check the order and the bill.The pizzas are delicious and come in the $14 - $16 range for a generously sized single. The Parma Ham and Arugula is a personal favourite, but the four seasons and salami ones are also excellent. My daughter likes the Hawaian best, with ham and pineapple. The bases are not too thick and the crusts are crunchy and tasty. Tabsco and parmesan are provided.The wine list is short but not expensive by Singapore standards and you can buy by the glass. The soups and pasta portions are more variable (I didn't rate the minestrone I was served at all) but the pasta with lamb and tomato sauce was gorgeous.There's a very good ice cream place next door for dessert, but parking in Jalan Riang can be a problem, as there's not much available and the streets are quite narrow. Similarly, you ought to call a taxi as there aren't many cruising the neighbourhood

So I went there last month for a birthday celebration with my cliques. From what I know, you have to make reservation here. I haven't heard of this place before, but after coming, it's somewhere which I will keep in mind when I need to bring my family or friends out for an italian/european style dining. The food is quite good. I ordered the mushroom risotto (which wasn't their signature dish) but it was awesomely good and filling. The price is also within the decent range, not too expensive. Only thing I dislike is the walking from the nearby station, which can easily take approximately 20 minutes
