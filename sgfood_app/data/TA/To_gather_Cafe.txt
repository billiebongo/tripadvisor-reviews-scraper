Interesting cafe with nice decor and good service. The food is quite tasty, and value for money. Worth a visit if you are nearby.

All time favourite cafe for friends & family. Reasonable portion of food for the wallet-friendly price to pay. Food quality is good and tasty. No hidden cost. üëç

Simple, nice food with a reasonable price
Dessert also good
Coffee should be good (looks and smells nice but I haven't tried...)

This is one of the cafe we will always come back to. Price reasonable and great food. Each time I am here, I will go for new stuff and it never disappoint me. For today, we had Stuffed Chimichanga (with Fajita Chicken) and Seafood Aglio Oglio. Love the positive quotes all over the cafe.

Ordered the teriyaki chicken pasta, all day breakfast platter and a butterscotch flavour ed ice latte. I would definitely go back for the pasta as it has a unique flavour to it! The pasta has a hint of black pepper and a tinge of sweetness from teriyaki sauce. However, I could not taste any butterscotch from my latte at all, it became too bland after awhile

Chargrilled Pork Belly was promoted as a Seasonal Special this week on the cafe Instagram, promising "crispy skin that crackles and succulent meat that melt in your mouth", surely it looks mouthwatering!But to my disappointment the skin wasn't crispy at all! It was too soft and rubbery. The meat, however, was very soft and easily break up in strands like pull pork. The BBQ sauce has a light and refreshing touch of worcestershire. The mashed potatoes has a consistently fluffy and smooth texture.Would have been a perfect dish if not for the skin

The Grilled Hamburger Steak was actually quite good, with a soft and juicy beef patty, and would have easily earned a 4-star, but the dish was completely let down by the accompanied sausages! I won't mind paying an extra dollar for a Bratwurst from Johnsonville or the like, but not the 2 cheap and tasteless sausages that appear to come from a can! Quite a good range of desserts on the menu if you have a sweet tooth, otherwise the mains are limited to the usual chicken chop, fish and chips etc and some spaghetti dish, would like to see more varieties of pasta.Otherwise a cute little neighbourhood cafe for casual dining

The place was small & busy. Great ambience. You hve to order ur meal at the counter. Pictures on the menu looks great but the taste was ok, nothing special about it. The Cabonara pasta was bit bland & watery. To-Gether sampler platter, all deep fry frozen packets. The Japanese seafood salad was delicious but only few tiny slices of seafood. very disappointe

This place is very cosy and nice. Love the food and reasonable. We had the fish and chips, rib eye mushroom steak, teriyaki chicken pasta, baked salmon. Desserts was fantastic. Chocolate lava cake, walnut brownie with vanilla ice cream with caramel. Not too sweet - just prefect. Highly recommended

First time here upon friend's recommendation. Love the ambience and the set up. Meaningful quotes on walls make the place more cheery. Had a great time here with wonderful company and yummy food. The pandan chicken and the fish and chips were good. In fact, everyone had a great meal and no regrets. Better still, to join the club, you only pay $1 and you can select a welcome gift of either a drink, nuggets or soup. Will be back. The only setback here is the limited parking close to the cafe, so might have to park slightly further away.

quiet corner of Bedok Town.
great value food and pleasant ambience.
good service and very good cafe music
no stomach for dessert after a goood portion all-day-breakfast. must return to try the lava cake, brownies, affogato!

Heard of it long time ago, first time here found the ambience a little small space, Foods taste was reasonable.
3
Normally neighbourhood cafe is quite cramp but we went on a Fri evening and find the place spacious and well lit. Food is not exceptional but dessert menu is quite decent. Indeed a good place to catch up with friends for coffee/dessert.
5
Couples would love the food.Families would love the price.Cafe hunters would love the drinks, coffee and dessert options.Heartlanders would be thankful it is right opposite their HDB.As for me, I love their fish and chips, value for money. At least it is not the usual Battered oily with greasy fries type.Their pasta is also good. It is just a great place to bring your family and friends to.Queue forms on weekends!!!
3
Decided to go for brunch and coffee during the weekend but this cafe doesn't has much breakfast selections and focus more on main dishes. In the end we skipped breakfast and had their salmon and chicken instead. Taste ok, coffee ok, chill n talk, easy place There is also cakes and desserts there.
3
Nicely-decorated and inviting place. Love the booth seats which offer privacy. Though the seafood aglio olio tasted normal, it was simply too oily. Fish and chips tasted fishy and was hard. However, the salad was fresh and was the best part of the meal. The dessert needs improvement. The matcha lava cake was too sweet with condensed milk over it. Cake texture was not smooth too. I still rated it 3-star due to the conducive ambience. A good place to have gathering over coffee and tea but not for dessert though. No harm giving the other main course on the menu a try though.
4
Just a typical cafe, even though I think the prices are slightly cheaper. The food is slightly above average, but nothing much to be wowed about. Do take note that there will be a queue during dinner period, so do come by earlier if you're looking to dine here
4
A simple cafe located at a quiet neighborhood. The waitresses are friendly and helpful. There is no service charge, that make the price lot affordable. But also expect some level of self service needed. The food are delicious, especially the Teriyaki Chicken Pasta. The must try desert is chocolate lava cake with vanilla ice cream topped with caramel.
2
Service getting worse. Not much people at 530pm but need to take fork and spoon ourself which is okay... Black pepper Chicken chop is hard... wonder why...maybe they chose a chicken that workout and its almost tasteless. Lava cake still taste nice though. Food haven't finish but ask whether or not to clear... And staffs are selective when thanking people for eating there when you leave... what happen to the standards... tsk tsk ts

Nestled in the Bedok area, this place is really cute and well decorated. We were a group of 9 people on a Friday evening and were able to find a table for lunch as we came early, but by the time we left, the place was pretty full. The menu offers a mix of pastas, salads, burgers etc. Pasta is not bad, but the serving size is a little small. Fish and chips & steak were good too
2
Went with a friend for dinner.
Nice decor & ambience
BUT
Ordered steak..was cold & bland.
Platter (appetiser) taste dry & not nice.
Feel very thirsty after dinner.

Nestled in a matured residential area, To-gether Cafe added flavour to the food options available in the area. Its my regular dinner place and my favourite is their Carbona. Tasty and the cream sauce is flavoursome. It can get crowded at dinner times on the weekends. But if you head on weekdays or lunch times, getting a seat isnt a problem.
4
Tried their signature dish Grilled Pandan Chicken and it's much nicer than their normal Grilled chicken. It has a mixture of lemongrass + coconut taste with mango topping..very unique taste. Many people ordered their mocha lava cake but I went for their chocolate lava instead which comes with rich chocolaty taste. Their pork cordon blue is nice but portion is a little small. Their homemade Tiramisu is worth every cent.

Hands up if you are looking for a cozy restaurant which serves decent western food at an affordable price. You may consider this cafe. However do set your expectation right as not to expect it will be a restaurant chef standard for the food. Simply a delicious basic western food selection. You will appreciate it for the price that you'll be paying and the ingredients portion they are serving. I must said, the coffee tasted quite good as well.What to look out for:The cafe can gets pretty busy during the peak hours, not to mention over the weekend. Try your luck, be there by heading over during the less busy period. This cafe is not one that is walking distance to the mrt station. However it's easy accessible by public buses or cab as there is a busy hawker center nearby

I was there for dinner with my friends yesterday. We reached at about 5.30pm and it was full house. It was ok for us to wait but the problem was, no proper queue system was in placed and the guy could not direct waiting customers in a proper manner. It was a chaotic start for us. When we asked how long was the waiting time, the guy told us it was not certain so we decided not to wait for an indoor table and took an outdoor table instead.The food (main course) portion was really small. I know the prices are really affordable but it was way too small....but I saw the pasta portions on the next table, they are larger than the mains. We also shared a seafood Japanese salad, taste was ok. We ended our meals with a cranberry cheese cake which was not really that good and also their specialty chocolate lava cake. I would say that the lava cake was the best thing for the night.The crowd died down by 7pm or so...the overall experience was err...ok..... Some staff was really helpful and friendly, some are not. Food was not that fantastic but prices were really affordable

The decor and concept of the place is great. Nice ambience. However, sitting is horrific. There isn't enough sitting during peak hours. The staff in charge of the sitting was lost and unable to organize the sitting and waitlist. We ended up in a tiff with another customer because of the sitting arrangement.The food was served very fast. Quality wasn't up to par. Salmon was over cooked, pork cordon bleu pork loin almost non existant, fish and chips used cheap frozen dory fish fillet. Main portions are on the smaller side. Everything else is average.Commendable was the chocolate lava cake. The waitress who served us was friendly and efficient. Thumbs up to her.Just the great decor and efficient waitress isn't a good enough reason for a second visit

Stay nearby but never once step in to this cafe as I always enjoy my hawker food at the nearby Blk 85 marketplace. So decided to visit today and paid S$47.90 for a pork cordon blue, 2 x spaghetti, a lava cake w/ice cream, 2 x hot chocolate and one latte. Considered cheap for an air conditioning cafe but food is blend and nothing fantastic. Service is pleasant, no service charge since we have to collect cutlery and water from the station. Would I return? Perhaps not unless weather is so hot that I need an air conditioning place for lunch or dinner.

This is our second time here since they opened.The atmosphere is relaxed. But the food was disappointing.Had the pork cordon bleu served with mustard cream sauce. The pork was alright, but needed a bit more flavour/kick to it. The mustard sauce unfortunately did not do the job as it did not remotely have any hint of mustard, apart from being yellow. Furthermore, when we asked for mustard, they told us it would be an added $0.50. For a condiment?Also had the spaghetti with meatballs. Sauce was not very flavourful.Iced butterscotch latte also wasn't strong enough in butterscotch flavour

Tried the lava cakes with vanilla ice - cream and thought it was very nice. There are 2 kinds: macha and chocolate. We tried both. The macha one had a richer taste, and a denser texture than most macha desserts that I've tried in Japanese cafes. It's not overwhelmingly sweet and surprisingly moist, even though I thought it had been baked hours ago because the surface looked dried out. The chocolate one was smooth and flavourful and moist as well. Both could have looked a bit more appetising if they were served dressed in a light dusting of icing or powdered sugar, but I'm not complaining. There was a bit more salt than usual in the chocolate one which I hope wasn't accidental. The cafe had a warm and welcoming ambience but I wished the staff were as friendly and warm.

Came round on a weekday night, but was still crowded. Tucked away in the heartlands of Bedok North, certainly nowhere near the tourist trail. Basically a self-serve cafe, stretched over two shop lots, with seemingly long queues on weekends. The menu has pasta, meat and the usual suspects, all for less than $20. You choose from the menu, queue to order, and collect your own cutlery, napkins and chilled water. Ambience is casual, verging on the noisy when the cafe is full. Food arrives quickly, and service to clear is efficient if a little anonymous.Difficult to fault for the price - food is good, but this is not really a place to sit and chill.

Tried the seafood aglio olio, totally awesome!
Must try the chocolate Lava with vanilla ice cream.
Price is also very reasonable without gst or service charge.
Great place for hanging out!

My family and I love to go there to have dinner. I especially love the matcha lava cake. Even my father who do not usually like western food liked going there!
4
Near my place!! The food is very affordable so I'll keep going back for more!
Maybe add more items on their menu??:-)
Their lava cake with ice cream is good!
3
The cafe is located in a rather nice HDB heartland neighbourhood in Bedok. The mains were OK but the main attraction are the desserts. I had the matcha lava cake.. #comfortfood

Try those Lava Cakes if you drop by. Cranberry cheesecake too. Love it!!!!! Imagine going to blk 85 and hitting this outlet... Damn Im full but still manage 1 lava and a cheesecake. üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

You can't beat a cafe that offers good food + good coffee + good atmosphere + good price. The only thing that might not be perfect is the crowd keep coming because it is good and a popular place. Not a place where you could sit for long to enjoy a good cup of coffee with book but definitely worth to enjoy a nice meal when your stomach is calling for something worth to feed

This cafe is near my house and I visit on average once in 2 months. I have introduced many friends to this place so far and everyone agrees with me that the food is simply awesome at an affordable price! My favorite is the salmon fillet. The fish is tender and juicy. The lemon sauce that goes with it is perfect! Although the serving looks small at first glance, don't be deceived by its look because it definitely can fill up your stomach! My second favorite is the lava cake! I've tried red velvet, matcha and chocolate lava cake. All flavours have been super tasty! But I've always loved matcha food products so I like that the best. May not be suitable for the older generation though. My mother finds it too sweet.It's better to go during non peak timings, especially if you stay nearby. During peak periods, it can be rather noisy and it's hard to talk to friends. Waiting time during peak periods are reasonable. On average, I wait for about 20 min during peak periods.

Went there for lunch with some colleagues. The good thing with this place is that they accept reservations. I really don't understand why some cafes especially some of the good ones, don't accept reservations. It simply means that you don't care about your customers and would rather have them wait.There were 5 of us sharing, so I ordered a Soup of the Day (Mushroom), Seafood Starter Platter, Seafood Aglio Olio, Quesadilla, Ribeye Steak, Grilled Pandan Chicken, and Grilled (or was it Baked) Salmon. The Mushroom Soup was so good that we ordered a second bowl as it wasn;t enough to share the first time round.The Ribeye was quite tough and was the least liked dish. It tasted more like strip or rump. The others were nice, and I particular liked the Grilled Pandan Chicken. Reasonable prices, but also smaller portions. So big eaters may have to have 1 1/2 to 2 mains :)There were 5 categories of desserts, and we tried them all :DDesserts were a Cranberry Cheesecake, Brownie with Ice Cream, Earl Grey Mousse, Tiramisu, and Chocolate Lava Cake with Ice Cream. All were very nice, my favourite being the Lava Cake. Again smaller portions as reflected by the reasonable prices.Had flavoured lattes but nothing to shout about. Total about 8 drinks.All for about $125 which is not too bad

The name of the cafe reminded me of the popular children song I used to sing ‚ÄúThe more we get together‚Ä¶.together, together‚Ä¶.the more we get together, the happier we‚Äôll be‚Ä¶‚Äù The cafe was conceptualised with togetherness in mind, for families and friends to mingle and have a good meal that goes easy on the wallet ‚Äì no GST and Service Charge! My friend told me that the business here was so brisk that they had to expand and acquire the neighbouring unit within a short period to cater to the crowds. The cafe is indeed popular as there were still customers strolling in even after 9 pm. The food here is really good and affordable with nice wooden decor to complete the homely experience. They even have student meals for students... The Matcha Lava cake was simply amazing. It was addictive and more unique than its chocolate counterpart. The cake was firm but its inside was filled with warm matcha liquid which was rich and gooey which simply melts in your mouth. I often bring my friends here for a meal and they all loved it!Another GST and service charge free cafe in Bedok is Refuel Cafe, located in Bedok Reservoir.For full stories and food reviews, visit:http://misschocoholic.com/2014/08/26/bedok-togather-cafe-percolate-cafe/http://misschocoholic.com/2014/12/31/refuel-cafe-bedok-reservoir

The matcha and chocolate lava cakes are both to-die-for. They are served warm, moist to just the right extent, soft and fluffy to just the right extent, oozes strong flavour, and is packed with hot, flowing juice.Wish the ice cream that comes with the lava cake is more creamy, rather than icy.I was disappointed with the mains though, as the flavor and portion of meat is too little. That said, I think it is considered cheap, relative to other similar cafe, so I am willing to overlook the quality of food a little.I love the ambience a lot, as it is right down my alley. It is on par with Carpenters and Cook in the West, in terms of how well the cottage feel is brought out. I am quite amazed how they manage to bring out the flavor so strongly with what looks like relatively affordable decor budget.I prefer to come during off-peak hours, as it is packed during meal times, and noisier than my liking. I find that there is a bit of crowd even during off-peak hours. But I do understand that the crowd is what will keep the prices affordable, so I can overlook this. Just come here with the intent to eat and move off, rather than read, and the experience will be enjoyable.I hope the service can be a little more friendly than I had experienced. Mostly, the staffs seem to be demanding me for answers, rather than politely asking what I'd like to have.Overall, I am attracted by the amazing decor and ambience, crazy lava cakes, and good prices. Will keep going back!
