Have come here several times now for desserts, so this is a review of what 1-Caramel is most locally famous for: desserts. For a good reason as well, as they're generally delicious. Special recommendations are the baked alaska and strawberry shortcake. Price for individual cake slices is fine at roughly SG$6.5, a la carte desserts are overpriced at $14 for their size, relative to what you get at other places. Service is acceptable if nothing more. Outdoor seats are excellent, inside run of the mill. The music is poorly chosen, borderline obnoxious. WI-FI often doesn't work, so don't come here if you plan to use it. The most annoying thing about this place is that they often cater for wedding parties and you'll find the place hired. Do drop by if you're in the area, but don't cross Singapore just to come here. These events happen so often you're likely to end up disappointed

The place is in the lovely Rochester area, but a bit difficult to find. The eggs benedicts we ordered were done very well and the red velvet cake we had was good. I was happy with the service provided by 1 waiter, who escorted us to the car when it rained. However I was not happy with another waiter who didn't seem to understand 'credit care promotion?' He just assumed I was asking if credit cards were accepted. Didn't seem like they trained their staff before allowing them to work the floor

Went with some friends for my birthday dinner. Service was terrible, wine was warm, food came in stages, my main course never arrived, they simply forgot. Food quality below average and the waiters are incompetent. A very poor experience in this price category, will never go there again
