Dont believe what they advertise or even what they say. Specially their "happy hour" offers might give you not so nice surprises.
Place looks nice from outside, but dont let first sight fool you.

Rubs outside of the USA are never quite as good, BUT these ribs are pretty close and the pulled meat burgers are also too good to skip

Nice informal place— good starters and ribs. Good beer and very good service. Good location. Overall very positive.

Stopped in for a quick lunch. Had the lunch special (burger, soup and drink for a little over $20) which was reasonable value and very tasty. Service and atmosphere left room for improvement though.

This place proudly advertises itself as having the worlds best ribs. So I decided to give it a try since I hadn't had ribs in a while. The staff seemed friendly enough and tried to educate me on what ribs were best to order. I ended up trying a full slab of honey and rum ribs along with a caesar salad and a pitcher of lemonade. About the only thing I was impressed with were the accompanying french fries that came with the ribs. But other than that, the cole slaw, ribs, and salad were bland and pedestrian at best. And when I received the bill of 86.75 SGD that clinched it for me. This place sealed it's fate of the dreading TA 1 rating. Besides this, the service was painfully slow and I couldn't help to get out of there as soon as possible. Eating here left a bad taste in my mouth both literally and figuratively. Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs !! You will thank me later if you do. What a waste of money this place represents !

The server was very friendly! You can actually smell the "smoke" from inside the mall and this is what gravitated us in trying this restaurant out. I think, although opinion based, the ratings given by people for this restaurant is low because if you read their comments they mostly say it's good but the numerical rating is very low. We ordered beer and Watermelon Iced Tea. The tea was very good. We ordered a full rack of pork ribs with cornbread, mixed veggies, and fries. The cornbread, for a "restaurant" was very good and not dry. Most places are very dry. The fries were good and seasoned well. The rack was a lot even for my husband and I to split the meal. The flavor of the rub was good.We cooked a lot of pork and ribs and been to many restaurants around the world and these were definitely on point. Try this place out

Reservation via online was easy. Service was great too despite them forgetting my order of bacon wrapped meatballs in which it was sent to us quite fast upon reminding. Half slab of ribs is seriously very filling so order a full slab if you really can eat. Down it with a refreshing Christmas drink. Overall the dining experience was really great there. Highly recommend the Smoked Peppercorn Ribs or the Spicy Asian BBQ Ribs .. both are really good

Great place for friends to chill and chit-chat while chomping your meat and washing it down with beer after beer.Staff are friendly and attentive but not intruding. Never fail to refill your water glasses.We tried their Carnivore Platter with added side and their handcut Beer Battered Onion Rings. I must say this is a lot of meat for four of us. However, I noticed that we are not alone as several tables also had their unconsumed meat packed to go. We had a good portion left for next day's lunch complete with salad, side, main and dessert muffin.Like the casual setting and variety of ribs. Will sure return for more.PS: Kids below 8 year old eats free with paying adult. They serve weekend ribs buffet at S$40/adult and S$20/child. Also if you celebrate your birthday there, with booking in advance, and spend a minimum of S$400, you'll get to enjoy free ribs for one year, not bad eh

Found this restaurant on our visit to the F1 track right outside Promenade MRT Station.The Staff are very friendly and the food is amazing. Very generous sized portions. There is a special 3 course offer for lunch Mondays to Friday's.Although we did not try the speciality ribs, all the food that we did have was exceptional. Definitively worth a visit.Ron and Susan Hessio

We came on a Sunday for lunch. Service was quick, friendly and efficient. The hot towels at the end was a nice touch. We had half a slab of Kansas flavoured Ribs and a full slab of Hickory flavoured ribs. Both equally yummy and more than enough for the 3 of us.

The entrée and one of two main meals were served simultaneously and were of dubious quality. Both main meals were also quite cold and unappetising.
It was an expensive meal considering the quality.

Dragged in there by my business partner. Processed food all over the place, nothing fresh. And as expected tasteless.
2
Came for the lunch offer, S$20 for a soup, drink and steak sandwich. Super chewy and tough with no flavor. Colleagues were not impressed with the fish and chips or 'steak' chicken chop either.
3
The portion of the ribs are big and generous. Prices are also affordable.
The only negative part is the ribs have been cooked earlier and heated up to serve. Very below average !

Ribs in Asia can be very hit and miss, this place is consistently good, not as good as Texas, but you can say the same about California ribs! If you enjoy ribs then you will enjoy them

This restaurant gets extremely busy. So busy in fact that the staff were actually running the night we visited. We stayed only for a couple of drinks and entree sized meals. The chicken wings were bland and tasteless but the nachos were a hit. Beer cold but poured only up to a line with a huge head on it. Wouldn't be accepted in Australia by beer drinkers. Overall, it was nice but wouldn't go back. Singapore is expensive with a 10% service fee and 7 % GST added to your bill

Went to Suntec and friend chose Morganfields as the restaurant was conveniently located just outside the MRT station. Place seemed more like a family place and it was relatively crowded on a Sunday evening. We ordered a rib and seafood platter to share. Portion was big and the 3 of us could not finished it. The BBQ ribs are good, tender and flavourful. The grilled prawns and fish and chips are rather bland and forgettable. Meal came up to about $150 for this dish and 1 glass of soda. Quite pricey in my opinion. Service was ok and staff was generally polite. The place is probably more suitable for family with kids or large group gatherings.

22Apr'17: first time patronising this restaurant in Suntec. Ribs tasted at least 10times better than Tony Roma's.Beer on tap also good (not diluted like else where)....*Service wise: i must be honest that the filipino lady supervisor-"Rose" service standard is Professional n polite *The sgrean door host "Grace" was also very patient n helpful in guiding me-a first timer here on the menu.*"Samuel" was nice too...While the rest of the sgren lady staff were a little too blunt ...especially "Rochelle"....blank face no smile...she may need to consider being a teacher instead rather than working in a restaurant...unless the mgt wishes to re-train her....if not for the above three service staff, i would have given two stars instead of four

Dropped in with my wife for a Sunday evening drink at this place outside Suntec City Tower 3; Suntec City is a huge office/ hotels/ shopping hub.Good service and reasonably priced drinks. It's a ribs place, so weekdays would see probably have large office groups dropping in after work. Also advertises lunch specials.Since we only had finger food, can't comment on the main attractions

They insisted to serve our second drink in 15 mins during happy hour regardless whether you have finished your first drink. Who set such crazy rules especially when competition is so keen with plenty of dining options. And the manager insisted to squeeze us next to another table of loud diners when there were other empty tables which we could have been given for some privacy. It was a rainy tuesday and place was far from busy. Was so put off, we decided to finish our drinks and have our dinner elsewhere. Definitely won't be back. No wonder the bar next door was more crowded

Good service from start to end. The signature ribs were a bit dry though. Half a slab and a starter is good for 2 small eaters. Loved the loaded tacos!
5
Great ribs and customer service. Also have reasonably priced set lunch for weekdays.
Do note that they may open till late at night, but the kitchen closes at 9.30pm or so. After which, only drinks.

Nice place for lunch or dinner. Has great ribs and burgers. The service is always great and food is pretty fast. The BBQ flavor is good with several options for sauce flavor. The dinner plates for 3 or 4 people are a great deal with a lot of food.

We came here quite a few times, especially during happy hour and with prices of beer in Singapore this can be quite important. Great beer with a few good choices, good food at reasonable prices, sometimes the service leaves a bit to be desired but not too much of an issue for me

We had lunch here. Plenty of staff, but little service. Can't explain what was wrong. There weren't many diners in there. It took quite a while for our orders to be taken and longer for the food to arrive. Thank goodness the ribs were cooked well and were very tasty. Two mains and soft drinks cost S$82

Walked in as it looked like a very friendly restaurant. We were greeted and shown to a cosy corner. My son was happy because it was next to a Pokestop and my daughter had cartoons to watch. We ordered 3 full racks of ribs, the Asian spicy, the honey barbecue and the peppercorn.The portions were huge and we have to take some home. We also had the nachos with cheese and pulled pork which was delicious. Too full to try the desserts which sounded yummy, especially the bread and butter pudding with whiskey topping. We'll be back :)

Nice little place to hang out and grab an afternoon refresher..just outside one of the billion Suntec mall entrances. Breeze and fans made it not too bad to sit and people watch in the middle of the afternoon. Staff was really friendly, prices by Singapore standards were in line. Nice place to walk to if you have time to kill waiting for your hop on hop off to arrive

I have visited Morganfields several times. I like the location right by Promenade MRT and the outdoor seating area is great to people watch. A nice venue to meet up with friends before the cinema to enjoy a drink or two during the great happy hour promotions they have.The food is ok. The place is famous for it's ribs and although they are not bad they are not as great as they claim. As for the service, I have to say every time I have been here it is nearly impossible to get the waiters attention when sitting outside. Seems the employees are too busy chatting to each other to take care of their customers and often i'll have to leave my seat just get their attention.A nice venue with ok food and great drinks promos but the service needs to improv

This restaurant advertised itself as the best ribs in town. Everyone knows the undusputed best ribs in town is at tony roma's so we were keen to see the fiod behind that bold claim.What a waste of our appetite.Prices prob same as tony romas But :- the ribs were dry inside and unchewable- the spices were only on the outside, inside pork was tasteless and bland- the corn was dry and no butter nor salt- coleslaw tasted fishy- Service was good though but cant make up for the horrible food.We ordered a whole rib and left 3/4 of it on the table. All the tables around us also left large portions of their ribs behind.Best ribs in town?What rubbish!!!

Morganfield provides diners with plenty of reasons to come back. Good food, ice cold draught beer, warm service and casual relaxed ambience. They specialize in ribs and I recommend those we enjoyed - smoked peppercorn spare ribs and hickory wood-smoked ribs. Taste is complemented by the veggies and mashed potatoes that come with it. A half slab is enough to fill your tummy. Pair it with cold Carlsberg or Asahi beer. Another reco to start your meal is chili cheese nachos, which are drizzled with cheese melt. Enjoy with jalapeÃ±o peppers.Truly relaxing environment.
