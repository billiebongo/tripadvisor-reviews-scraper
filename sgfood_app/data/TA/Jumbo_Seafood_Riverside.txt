As it was during CNY period. I assume that the food was prepared way too early as it was cold when served.
4
It's also one of the most popular restaurants among the Chinese tourists. The seafood, especially the crab, is tasty. Due to the crowded customers, the restaurant limit the dining time about 1.5 hours for each table. Of course, the expense is not cheap.

It was our second time to visit Jumbo, we order chilli crab and pump, taste was good!! Nice Staff and view.

Had been here many years before and was blown away so on a recent transit in Singapore we left the airport just to go have Chilli crab... what a let down!The service was horrendous- we were kept waiting for ages until we had to find ourselves a staff member. When asking for advice on what we were ordering he replied with "well I'm not the one eating"!! Despite all this we waited with great expectations for our Chilli crab... only to be disappointed by the obvious dive in standards since our last visit. While the crab was decent it certainly wasn't worth leaving the airport for just this one meal!Finally when the bill arrived we were astounded - $225 for a meal of two crabs, three sides and NO BEVERAGES at all! I can't justify this price bracket for a wayside joint with no ambiance whatsoever. Beware the "Market Price" - always asks for a ballpark figure per crab. Never again. I'm sure you can find much better for that price point

Well! Where do I begin? We should have listened to our taxi driver who said that he’d heard this restaurant was expensive and not very good. We had noted the varied Trip Advisor reports but, nevertheless, arrived for lunch at 1.45 full of optimism. We were informed that last orders were at 2.15 and that the restaurant closed at 3 pm. Fair enough – we knew where we stood. We rejected the first table we were offered at the back and accepted one with a lovely river view. Having perused the menu, we ordered at 2pm, whereupon the waiter produced the bill, including service charge, and said we’d have to pay immediately because they were shutting an hour later. We were surprised and not very happy about this. We had ordered four starter sized dishes to share, one from the vegetable section, one from rice and noodles and two prawn dishes from the fish section. We had no complaint about the quality of the food – the portions were generous and the flavour reasonably good, especially the prawns with pumpkin puree and the sweet and sour prawns. However, the broccoli and scallops arrived first. When this was finished the two prawn dishes arrived. Suspecting that we might not see the noodles until after we’d finished, we asked if we could have the noodles with the prawns. This completely flummoxed the waiter who disappeared but our noodles did arrive just before we had finished all the prawns. We had ordered a bottle of wine. When this arrived we were not shown the bottle, nor asked to taste the wine. It was just left on the table, presumably for us to open ourselves. Neither were we given napkins - when we asked, we were given two of the paper bibs usually supplied when eating crab or lobster. We folded these and put them on our laps.Would we recommend this restaurant? Absolutely not! Not once did anyone come to enquire if we were enjoying our meal and our departure wasn’t even noticed!!!

Managed to get a table without a reservation, but was very disappointed with the menu,thought it would be more inclined to western tastes, but found it was more to Asian tastes, the crab looked great but for people who don't like the whole crab (including whats in the main shell) then the price is rather expensive for a family trea
2
ordered the chillicrab and shrimp with a fried rice,, i dint know why the fried rice took soo long to come, we even almost finish eating the crab and shrimp,, asked for like 4 times,, when then finally it came... pls improve your service, your food is amazing.
2
Extensive menu, but they would be far better off doing a few things well, rather than lots mediocre. I found the service slow, for instance the rice came an hour after we started the meal, despite asking twice where it was.Far from impressed, i should have read some of the reviews before booking
5
I had a very nice experience with this place and had Jelly Fish for the first time in my life.You can get finger licking Sri Lankan Crab / Prawns from here but be aware of the price tag. :-)You can enjoy the view if you can visit there during night time
4
Had a party of 10 paxs for a simple get together meal. The standard of the food is still above average and service was surprisingly good despite the crowd on a Saturday night. Food was served quickly but not rushed so we had ample time to finish our meal in the 2 hour time slot allocated
5
Chilli crab was perfect! So tasty and chilli blended well with crab without losing flavour. Service excellent!
5
We had a table outside with good view of the river. It was beautiful. The food is excellent. The service is top notch. Enjoyed the evening.
5
The crab was amazing, it’s a very busy place and it’s hart to find a table but is really worth it. Highly recommend!
1
My tooth broke when im eating. crab. Please do not give a time limit. I feel so bad. Please do your best
3
The greetings for Lo-Hei is well done. The food is standard quality as usual. Need to improve on the cleanliness of the Restaurant.

I was told that Jumbo had good chili crab and since I was only in town for 36 hours I thought I’d try it out. At the check-in desk I was told I had one hour to be gone, which wasn’t very hospitable but I was alone so I was okay with eating quickly. I was sat inside and my first interaction was when I asked for water and was told, “we don’t provide water.” It turned out that you had to buy it. They drop a bowl of peanuts on your table (without asking if you want it) and you find that on your bill as well. My main gripe was the chili crab. It was a Dungeness crab, served in its shell in a tomato chili stew-like broth. It was a ton of work, very messy, the experience was not enjoyable, the flavor was *okay* and when the bill came they charged me somewhere between $80-$100 USD (I had to convert to believe my eyes) for it. My bill for one person with no alcohol came to $110 USD.Don’t go here. Whatever you do. Unless you have money to throw away and like bland food
3
Had chilli and blackpeper crab though quite tasty it was horrendously expensive. Beware ordering extra buns, to soak up the sauce or any extras for that matter you will be charged for them and not cheap. Even though we did not order peanuts they were put on our table which we thought were complimentary guess what yep they were on the bill ( experienced this before, some of us don't learn !!! )The beers were also on the expensive side as well, glad we didn't order wine that would have been scary. The service was very average as it was quite busy hate to think what it would be like if they were very busy. We have eaten here before with same results so nothing has changed. Summing up there are as good if not better and less expensive places to have chilli crab where you are not paying for the name and area eg. No Signboard seafood restaurant, Eng Sen ( a bit out of hub ) , Red House seafood East Coast and Mellben seafood to name but a few that are certainly worth a try. Hope this is of benefit to you in making decisions.
4
Quite pricy for the crabs at $88/kg. Food was good. Service staff were very attentive. The only thing I would suggest is to have some racks for us to put our bags. We had to either put our bags on our lap or put it on the floor while we were having our meal throughout.
2
Still trying to figure out what the hype is about this place. We were not impressed with anything we ordered from the menu, and we tried a lot. The meat was fatty and the seafood was very fishy. The restaurant has ZERO ambiance and is bright, packed, and loud
4
i may not be a fan of crab but the pepper crab is superb! juicy and meaty. the aroma of the sauce is perfect, flavourful and strong, but not overwhelming as i could still taste the hint of sweetness of the crab meat. no doubt, it’s expensive to dine here. and i prefer the pepper crab over the chili crab. don’t know why...
5
Superb chili crab, been great with buns. Duck salad, fried shrimps with secret powder is also nice. Good location and atmosphere. Excellent services. Reservation is recommended. Absolutely be back again.
4
. The food was good.Just that it was a bit crowded on a Sunday.
Overall we had a pleasant family meal together.
5
What a delicious chilly crab and pepper crab
Nice service and kindness
Because of laser show on rivercruise i went late.
But i could ate crab due to Jumbo's kindness
Thank you sooo much!!!
5
Jumbo's food quality is good, The riverside point branch has very nice view but I feel it's little expensive.
4
I ate chili craps and the taste was so nice. and I can feel the night river view. but there was limitation in time. so i had to eat in hurry.
5
I think the is the most popular and best place serving seafood.
It's hard to get ad-hoc seat, especially if you come with the group of friends.
So, pre-booking definitely recommended.
2
Unhappy with time limit set to dinners to complete dinning. Food us ok, but service level not up yo expectations.
4
Service good. Price comparable to other well known chilli crab and black pepper crab nicely decorated restaurant. Will host my vips and tourists here should there wana tast good cum "up-market" sg crab dishes. I will skip other dishes due to the high price...eg: not many will go to an authentic peakin duck restaurant to order fish or seafood..
4
Been going to this seafood restaurant for many years when ever I am in Singapore. Must eat their Chilli crabs with the distinct and beautiful taste you can not find somewhere else. Very crowded every weeknights especially on weekend. Can book online before turn up or walk-in for a smaller group. Good location for local by MRT or buses also in the middle of popular tourist place in Clarke Quay precinct
4
This is a large and at first sight a chaotic restaurant, however if you look closer it is a very efficient machine.I like the walk up reservation system, for locals and tourists they call you when your table is ready.Chilli crab was excellent and better than No Signboard. Service was prompt and beer refills came without too much delay. I have eaten here a few times and I think the service has improved and the food seems to be consistently good
4
Reservation was handled nicely especially since we are going there with the kids. Food is good especially the chilli crab. Not to mention the nice view of night time clarke quay.
5
Wonderful location, amazing seafood! Service is lovely and they pamper you with the aprons and bag covers (not that they needed to!).
5
nice view near Singapore River and also can book a private room. its very suit for bring guests and friends to enjoy and relax environment.
4
Had lunch there for our anniversary. Had chillies crab, nice n good. A bit x. Service was good, environment OK.
3
The cost is too high for tourist and passport not discount.
but service is good. It's delicious, but it's worth it.
4
This is one well-known restaurant in Singapore but I think it is quite overrated. But in general, we had a very delicious food and good service.Reservation - better make one especially if you are a big group as usually there is a long queueFood - they have big spread and can be vegetarian-friendly too. Must try the chili crab of course, you can tell them how you want your crabs to be cookedPrice - bit expensive I must say as there are other restaurants around Singapore that also offer chili crab but more reasonable priceService - staff are very polite and accommodatingAmbiance - as we are seated outside (al fresco), you can see and hear noise and people in neighboring restuarantBut definitely I will be bac

After reading about the famous chilli crab, we booked online and duly arrived for lunch. We were left waiting at the front desk for 5 minutes until someone came over to serve us. We were then led to a table for two next to another couple who were loudly talking on their phone and eating their food noisily (smack, smack, went the lips, must have been nice!). We sat for a while, were served some nuts and tea and left with menus. We sat for a while longer and the next table occupied by another couple. So now hemmed in on both sides, why are the tables so close! Now feeling a little annoyed as there were plenty of spare tables. Then the new couple had their orders taken and we were still waiting. Decided to give it a miss and left. This place has the feel of a fast food restaurant, so not a great atmosphere plus service is poor. Can't comment on the food as we didn't bother to try. There are plenty of other places in Singapore to eat chilli crab. Recommend elsewhere and not this restaurant
4
we try the most popular cuisine chili crap, and it was good (not bad). but you know, it's really expensive!! I'd rather recommend you to go to the china town to eat same menu in half price. anyway the taste was good and in my case, I like the cereal prawn the most!! :D well.. anyway there is always crowded with so many people.
4
the sugar cane shrimp is a MUST TRY. its amazing!! u can share fried rice and noodles with a partner and order shrimps in many different styles. thats wit i ordered and it was great!the waiters there have an attitude which u must accept because this is the normal in very crowded cosmopolitan countries or cities. so ill let that pass to
4
Went here for lunch with my wife, son and a friend, I was the only one of our group who is not a bid seafood eater, however there are other options. I had the ribeye steak, which was great but small and came on its own, sides are very limited. The others had the Chilli Crab which they said was great but is it worth $20 more than other restaurants nearby
4
Good taste but a little expensive for seafood. chilli crab and cereal shrimp is recommended.
Nice place for dinner.
Reservation on website is better because a lot of people wait in front of restaurants !
5
Their VIP room was elegant, nice and great for groups with kids. It’s easier to handle as the kids are contained in a place. The food is excellent as usual.
5
Well managed and trained service staff. Nice ambience facing Clarke Quay along Singapore river. Good food with wide choice for selection in their menu. Waitnig time for food is also reasonable. Quality of food is good.
2
This restaurant is always busy. You had better make a reservation beforehand otherwise you have to queue. Famous chili crab is good. There are some options. Chili, pepper, and something else. You might want to bring a wet tissue
5
Great food great location great atmosphere, lovely place to take new friends. Menu was really diverse with some very interesting choices.
4
You can't go wrong with Jumbo in terms of quality of food. The price is on the higher side but other than that, awesome place.
4
We met a friend here for dinner and shared chili crab, vegetables, and another meat-based dish I can't remember. The food was excellent however, we got charged for a jug of beer we didn't order, so check your receipt before you pay. The wait staff were ok, but more accommodating if you were male for some reason. All up, it was a nice experience on the waterfront with good food and company
2
What some restaurants still don't seem to understand is that if you offer crap service, it has a huge impact upon the whole dining experience for the customer. And so it came to pass last week at Jumbo for us. There was a queue but that wasn't a problem for us as we registered and opted to go for share table - no problem with that either, nice people and nice to interact with new friends for a while. Problem was that my wife's dish came first and I had to ask several times for an eta for mine. It eventually came some 20 minutes after my wife's, she obviously had finished as had everyone else at the table. My crab was ok, not great or fantastic, it was ok but the night out was spoiled for us. No words of apology from anyone serving us. Insult to injury, those peanuts and tea that were placed in front of us when we arrived, there's a 3 dollar charge for them. Jumbo, you're having a laugh at your customers' expense and one day, when people have had enough of the rip off prices and shabby service, you'll regret it. For now enjoy the millions you make every year but we won't be contributing to it again in future
3
It's ok but the staff is very stressed. The whole place is loud and noisy with shouting chinese waiters and customers. Food is ok but not special, our expectations were high. Location is good but note that they have several restaurants, this one is in the central of Clarkes Quay
4
On previous trips ate at the East Coast branch but this one was a short walk from hotel. Had table overlooking the river and it was pleasant. It is very busy and you should book to reserve a table. You can book online. Book early to get your preferred time, I think they turn over the tables a few times over the course of the evening. Thatâ€™s how popular this location is.The crabs were well cooked and tasty. The service can be slow during busy times. The prices are on the high side but worth it for the quality and the location
4
The food variety is limited, not much meat dishes, mainly seafood. And prices is more on the high side, but quality of food is good
2
Everything I would come to Singapore I had to go to jumbo. But after so many years it’s not the same. Food is different and become much more oily and just not the old jumbo. Become more of a cash machine
5
Quality seafood and dinner with nice view to enjoy eating and relaxing.
Chilli crabs with bun, prawn cereal that good taste, scallops with spinach.
3
Some waiters are too cool. Wait long for ordering, need more order waiters. Food come too slow. Nice atmosphere outside. Price is expensive.
3
Very disappointed with the lunch service. My meal of prawns and asparagus was excellent but I finished it before my husbandâ€™s chili crab appeared...I think maybe they had forgotten to put in order. We had to keep asking for napkins and drink service pretty ordinary. They wanted to clear the restaurant even though it wasnâ€™t 2.30 pm...couple next to us were given their bill before their drinks had arrived! Not good enough for a $S 160 lunch. Have to say chili crab was great but they are resting on their laurels with their indifferent service
4
Besides the Jumbo at East Coast, this place located in CBD, which is very convenient. Yummy Seafood, especially a place for Crabs . Came here for lunch. We had geoduck, Alaska crabs with chilli and black pepper, herbal prawns, claypot Sharkfin, steamed fish, noodles, veggy & veggy.. The fish & crabs taste better than the East Coast, perhaps Riverside outlet was not as crowded as East Coast outlet. PS: the table set up was very cramped, hard to move between tables, and 8 pax table was too small. If it can be slightly more spacious
4
The chilli and black pepper crabs are a must try if you love local fare! Mee goreng and other dishes are all tasty! Nice central location and night life around area give you opportunity to experience the night life after a satisfying meal along the river! Make sure you reserve a table in advance in order to prevent disappointment
3
Popular and busy place, where staff is rude and everything tells you that you must eat and go the faster the better. Meal is overpriced, we took appetizers and they were very average, their speciality is crabs. We took a chilli one, it was good! Do not plan a special evening there, take just crab and rice. Donâ€™t forget to ask your waiter for apron and gloves to eat your crab.
3
On recommendation of someone, we went to Jumbo Seafood when we went to Singapore (we were there for one evening). We felt that for the price, the food was sub-par. The crab was fun - I guess. But ultimately, the place felt too much like a chain restaurant in the U
5
If you like crab this is the place to go, big crabs, little crabs, hard-shell, soft-shell, boiled or fried. It doesn't get tastier or messier than this. Basic interior design, utilitarian even, but you are here for the seafood right? Salt and pepper crab and fried soft-shells were the standout dishes for me.Don't forget to ask for the souvenir plush crab :
5
My wife and I have procrastinated fir 15 years about trying chilli crab. Jumbo Seafood was recommended my almost everyone we ask so we decided to book and try it. In the language of our youth-OMFG was it unbelievable! It was well wort the wait.
4
The food is very good. It is a bit expensive. It is noisy inside the restaurant. Limited time for seating is a big rush to finish the meals for slow eater.
4
This place is great for some authentic Singapore chilli crab and crispy buns. It’s nothing fancy and the crab is quite expensive- but it’s delicious! Singapore chilli crab is a must-have while in Singapore- this is a safe bet for an authentic experience.
4
The crab is very good, we ate two times during my 4days Singapore trip
Highly recommended to pre-order the bigger size if crab
3
This has got to be the best restaurant in Singapore for the famous Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab. Been here many times and had the best time and excellent food. This time thought in my opinion the service was somewhat questionable. I get that it was busy but to be honest I've been there when its been a lot busier. We felt rushed too as once seated were told our time to be out which as it turned out to be one hour and 20 minutes, which I guess is fine but when the food takes a while arrive at the table it was a bit rushed. Various items had to be asked for a staff a little pre-occupied to be honest.But saying all that I cannot fault the quality of the food its excellent. It will not stop me visiting again soon
5
Even at its busiest on New year's eve, the staff were pleasant and helpful, and food delivered on all counts. Jumbo does pepper crab better than every seafood institution out there. Flavor not only coated the shells but permeated the flesh within. Pepper crab cannot be missed!
1
We struggled to get anyone’s attention to order when we sat down. They then gave us one appetiser and one entree when we ordered 2 which was clearly printed on our receipt at our table. Once we asked they informed us that the kitchen had sold out of that item just the. However we order the item 45 mins prior and they had no intention of telling us they had sold out. They granted us a 10% discount on the food not the beer or total bill. Better options around the area with better service
4
We had a great meal here xmas day. There are other restaurants nearby along clarke quay that we considered going to but after looking at the reviews im glad we went to Jumbo instead. Food was great would recommend salted egg prawns and stuffed bean curd. We didnt get any crab as we wanted to keep the price down and there are plenty of other options on the menu.
2
This place seems packed every night so I must be missing something that the locals like. Plus the wait was nearly an hour because we were unable to get reservations. I personally would not recommend it to anyone I know.Firstly, we had the signature chilli crab, along with a very small plate of scallops with broccoli, and a small, single abalone. No alcohol, just tea. But dinner was $200 for two which was the same cost as Wolfgang Puck’s Spago’s, a five star location (also excluding wine as we had a bottle left over from dinner at the bar the night before). And we left feeling underfed even with rice and buns. Slightly naughty that they charge you for things without telling you. Being charged for tea did not completely surprise me but being charged for a small dish of 15 peanuts that were on the table before we sat down was.The food is tasty although not exceptionally so. It would compare to most good restaurants in Chinatown. The chilli crab is definitely succulent. And the abalone was firm without being rubbery. The scallops also had a nice flavour. On food alone this might be a FOUR rating.Cleanliness is a real issue. The food itself, namely the crab and the sauce it is served with, tends to create a mess. A gentleman nearby lost his very large crab claw in a scene straight out of Pretty Woman. He only found it at the end of dinner, lost amongst his wife’s belongings. Despite the use of two bibs and being a generally meticulous eater, I still managed to stain my shirt in three places, as did everyone else at my table. This is part of the experience. But even in between seatings, the staff did not wipe down the table very well as there was crab and rice all over the seats even before we sat down.This is a popular family restaurant chain and there were loads of children. Literally, I have never seen so many children in one location that was not a school or playground. It would have been noisy anyway but this was a new level. Something to keep in mind if you are expecting a more low key evening.As I said, the food was good. But I think I could have had the same meal for half the price even before taking into account the dry cleaning bill. And it would have been quieter too. Having to wait an hour to get charged for peanuts no one wants seems an unnecessary indignity
5
Revisited recently for my birthday lunch treat from my dearest daughter. As always, the chilli crab never failed our expectation. The scallop wrapped with yam ring was tender and juicy and spinach with 3 types of egg was fantastic even to the eyes that our neighboring table ordered the same. Will always come back to this restaurant for meals that never fail
4
Good food and good service!
However, the crab is over price!
Overall experience is great, but, if the price of crab is less steep, I'll give excellent!
1
Kitchen and toilet filthy! Filthy! Food quality was low and expensive. Charging for tea refills not asked for is also low class.
5
Had a great meal here Chilli crab, Scallops, prawns and calamari. All well cooked. Very busy but good service and a good wine list with reasonably priced wine.
5
make sure you book, i prefer a table outside. the difficulty is to go for either chili or black-pepper
4
Overall satisfied. Just that they forget to give us menu after we waiting for quite some time. LOL
The food is quite nice, atmosphere also good.
3
Was here for business lunch. They mixed up our reservation and ushered us to the wrong table. Had to wait for them to sort out the confusion. Lunch set was average, n portion was all’s average. Not much ambience as restaurant was crowded with tourists. Would prefer other outlets than this for future visits.
5
I have been to Jumbo's several times and they never disappoint. It is pricey and you can get cheaper chili crab but Jumbo's is consistently excellent. The chili crab and buns were the highlight of the meal and are a must have at Jumbo's. However this time I decided to be more adventurous and ordered the marinated jellyfish. It was fantastic! If you can get past the idea of eating jellyfish, I highly recommend this dish. Also, the location is excellent. We sat outside and were lucky enough to have a beautiful sunset during dinner.Next time I am in Singapore I will definitely be going back to Jumbo's
3
The location is very nice, especially if you get an outside table. But I was disappointed to see the pages and pages of menu items listed as “market price.” I understand that prices may fluctuate. But to have so many items with absolutely no price reference was frustrating. We ordered the fried baby squid to start. These were tiny whole squid, deep fried (shell and all) and coated in a very strong fish sauce. I’m sure this must be a common way of cooking them here, but the kids would not eat them whereas they usually love fried squid. For mains, we had the scallop & asparagus stir-fry, and the prawn & broccoli stir-fry (largely because they had prices on them). They were both fresh and tasty. The kids had the fried chicken, which was also good. But all of the dishes were way overpriced. With seafood so plentiful here, I struggle to see how they can get away with charging so much.
4
Enjoyable outdoor waterfront location. Big menu but you're here for the chili crab, aren't you? You should be, it's really good if extremely messy (do not reject the bib), and you'll do well to order some rice to go with, useful for sopping up the spicy-sweet chili sauce. You have to sop up the sauce, since much of the crab sort of disintegrates into it. We also got a duck-mango appetizer that was good, and the spiced peanuts go well with Tiger beer, and I'm sure other menu items are good, but let's be real: you're here for the crab. As you should be
5
On our last night of holiday, we wanted to have a nice dinner around the quay. We were suggested Jumbo Seafood by the lady at the reception in the hotel we were staying. The restaurant was no longer taking booking online and it was Saturday. So we decided to test our luck by just arriving at their door.Well, turned out it was our lucky day. We were sat at the best possible location in the outdoor without waiting even a minute and the restaurant was buzzing with customers.We didn't go for the crab because we were kind of tired eating it by then. We ordered baby squids, two types of cod, sautéed spinach and seafood fried rice. We ordered the small portion of fried rice- it was really good and quite huge in quantity. Three of us could not finish it. The cods were great - the wok fried one was sweet with a hint of spice. My 9 year old simply loved it. The baby squid was crunchy & delicious. We ordered the house white wine which was decent.Overall, we had a nice cosy dinner. Though it was crowded, it didn't feel noisy at all. There was a group of young boys and girls performing on the bridge. The air was colorful & festive. The service was impeccable. It was a bit on the expensive side but it was worth it. We had our perfect family dinner and I look forward to go back
1
I would never suggest anyone to go this place. It is definitely overpriced and not value for money!!
4
Food is excellent, atmosphere is great.
Air-condition is too strong, so made the food cold very quick.
Service is average.
4
Nice restaurant and food was great maybe abit expensive but overall is also good. I went to Singapore twice here's my favourite one
4
The food is good. This place is very famous in Singapore. Reasonable priced in the medium category. The restaurant is outside seating as well as inside A/C.
5
I have visited this Jumbo many times only to satisfy my taste buds and end up creating more hunger only to visit one more time. Best place to have seafood
5
I ordered the Chili Crab & Crab steam with Soy milk & Egg White, they are totally 2 different, & both are delicious.The Sea Brass is so tasty in Steam with soy sauce.The scallops are tender, & the fried rice is no complaint at all, especially the prawns in fried rice are also with quality.Everything is about the pricing
1
Reservations were made beforehand several weeks ago. However, no seats were available when visiting. The entrance to the restaurant was a mess with people like me.In particular, the female employee who conducted the announcement at the desk was the worst. When I asked when I could go in, she screamed and said, " Wait there! " She worked at 7:30 p.m. on December 5 at Riverside Point. Hopefully there will be improvements
3
We were there to try for the 2nd time the chili crab (1st time was 4 yrs ago and at the seaside location.). When we sat on the table, peanuts were displayed on table. (We enjoyed it but guess what they charged for a small plate of peanut when we did not order for it??? Chili crab was good and delicious. Fried rice and the appetizer (sampler) were good. We asked for additional tea after we paid and they were reluctant to serve us some more. (Tea was not free!
4
Been here several times over the years. I thought this dinner was even better than previous ones. Black pepper crab was superb. Worth the journey for that alone. Prawns with sweet and sour sauce, chunks of pineapple and Phoenix chicken(crispy skin over a seafood stuffing). Egg fried rice. A couple of jugs of Tiger beer. Seemed better than previous visits
4
I've been to Jumbo several times and my favorite are chili crab with mantao. the sauce was really tasty and the crab was so big, it's enough for 2 people. The service was excellent and responsive. The reservation is online for all Jumbo' restaurants so they could advise you the fastest queue. If you could get the outdoor table, you could see riverside' view and it was lovely
4
Had the pepper crab here for lunch and it was good. The restaurant seems to be a chain so it has that atmosphere but the location on the river is good and everybody eating there were having a good time.
4
Nice food presentation with a great taste especially chill crab, many kinds of noddles and seafood. It would attract you to come back soon.
5
Dinner in the jumbo restaurant,interesting menu, wonderful meal.
Nice view and good location. worth to eat
4
As usual, it was full by 730pm. Service was OK, with attentive wait staff and plates changed often etc. Food also came quite fast.
5
My family was a very good experience.
My family is all want to go back to when I visit Singapore next time.
5
The chili crab with buns was really good. The price is the same as in other restaurants. You will need a reservation, at least for dinner, but their system is very professional.
4
The chili crab is good but the service a bit slow due to too many people at the restaurant and overall experience is good
5
To be honest, I wasn't actually prepared for how large the "small" chili crab was. Servers were very responsive and the wait for the table during prime dinner time was very short. Would highly recommend.

Excellent meal with family at Jumbo Seafood, Riverside Point. The Black Pepper Crab was very tasty as usual, served with some extra pepper gravy on request. The sides - fried rice and kalian, washed down with some Tiger beer, were perfect supporting cast. Making an EARLY reservation is recommended - this is a place in high demand on any given day. Staff is very efficient and prompt. The place is easily accessible via public transport - Bus/MRT, and leisurely after-dinner stroll around Clark Quay rounds up a really nice Singapore experience

Had a wonderful time. Reserved for a table of 12 via online. Table was ready for us before the scheduled time at 7.30pm on friday evening. Definitely encourage everyone to reserve a table to avoid waiting. Food was good as usual and the main dish is of course the chilli crab. Beer and wine was made available as well. Everyone had a good time

This is the 1st time I visit this restaurant. Is not worth it to try. Bad service with normal taste food. I won’t come back again.

Had delicious food with good dishes! Must try the cereal shrimp and chili crab as a main dish :) Overall. good experience!

Being a sea food lover this place was suggested by some friends .. It is an awesome place to have some lip smacking sea food .. we ordered prawns and crabs and some drinks to gulp it down .. Not very far from Marina Bay .. The dinner time is a perfect place to be .. with the lighted city and the river .. service ir decent and ambiance is natural .. definitely a not to be missed restauran
4
On suggestion by one business associate a few friends decided to try out dining at this sea food restaurant. The city atmosphere the fine ambience and we starved for some wonderful sea food. A piece of advice to those who are not keen sea food lovers this certainly is not the place but those who love good sea food this is none of the place you must visit. The fish variety those wonderful prawns different variety of shrimp above all the huge lobster very well cooked. Do go with friends alone you may miss out the variety.most importantly do not take any alcohol you may not really relish the taste give your buds the chance to enjoy every dish you order they really do make you feel wanting to visit them again

This place is the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. Totally overpriced!!! 70 sgd for the chili crab which they do not write in the menu. Furthermore they ask if you want tea and gives you peanuts when you come and then they charge you for it!!! The service is soo bad and rude, and the food even worse. Don’t go there! Tourist trap x10000! Can’t believe I spend so much money such bad place.

Very bad dinner time at JUMBO Seafood Reverside Point.With very bad service, no outside place for two person with our reservation of 3 weeks ago. No discussion with guests.It’s very cold inside place, but they can’t change their temperature.But JUMBO in Shanghai was very good service and very good food. But not in Singapore

We visited on 23/11 and order black pepper crab. The taste not what we have expecting. To us, the crab was not fry, it looks more like dip into hot water than do a little fry with black pepper. If it is fry till the Crab is cooked,the black pepper will sip into the meat and the taste will be very much different. We went next day to Geyland No Signboard restaurant have the white pepper fry crab, it is very much better and that's real fry crab.Good luck Crab Lover
5
The food is very good. We had the chilli crab, the pepper crab, fish, prawns and their fried rice. Everything was really good. I've tried heir chilli crab before and it was my first time trying the pepper crab and I must say I think I may have found a new favourite ☺️Only catch is that the pepper crab is a dry dish whilst the chilli crab has a lovely sauce /gravy They also have high chairs if your parents travelling with kids
4
Great place to have a beer and local sea food delicacies, especially the famous pepper and chili crabs. Ambiance is great, setting by the river is superb a and the food is extra yummy. If you are visiting town for the first time this is a must go!
3
We ordered the “pepper crab” and some steamed fish (was supposed to be red snapper...) with nyonya sauceFood was good ,pricey but good.I normally review restaurants by their food and not their service but I have to say this time,We had terrible service,It is one of their most touristy locations (by Clarke Quay)and most of the staff barely speaks English,This is not my first time at jumbo seafood’s I have been at the Dempsey location And also at their beach location, and experience was much more pleasant.The waiters were not attentive and very forgetful, we have to ask for utensils extra plates for our shells and napkins several times, they didn’t even give us the usual wet naps.And make things worse they gave us time out, they told us we have to finish our meal and vacate The table by 8:30 PM.I like Jumbo seafood but if you want to have a good experience take the extra time and go to one of the other locations
5
My wife and me had been there. It was so fantastic food and views. I love there, so we will go there soon.
5
Thumb up! Good food and service, continue to keep up the standard, I can see your
customers do come back for more.
4
Food is of good quality but on the high end, the time constraints put pressure on the diners to finish their meals quickly without really savouring
4
One of the best chili crabs ever. The booking needs to be done early, at least 2 weeks in advance. The service was good. The environment can be a bit noisy.
1
One of the poorest dining experiences I have ever had in Singapore, having visited over a dozen times. Slow and uncoordinated service, poor quality prawns (so obviously previously frozen - you can tell because the shells stick to the meat, the taste is not fresh and they take ages to reach the table because you have to defrost them carefully), overpriced, servers (some of them but not all by any means) with poor attitudes.... as a well travelled tourist, I should have known better. Being in Clarke Quay, this is a tourist trap. Despite the positive reviews (interestingly, typically from Singaporeans but not so much from visitors), I will avoid it in the future. Not recommended at all.
4
You may need to wait for a table but there are plenty of bars nearby. Leave your details and come back. The Chilli Crab was great as was the steak, and cod. The food was fresh, came in a reasonable time and we did not leave hungry. There are more authentic restaurants, but if your staying nearby it is well worth a visit and I am sure you won't be disappointed
4
Excellent food and the chili-crab is a must, but a mess, since it was covered in a fabulous sauce - am grateful for the bibs. I really liked how they handled our "walk in" They told us we could have a table but had to be out at a certain time (75 minutes). That worked well for us and I appreciated their "contract." It's a good approach. With that said, the food was wonderful and sevice goo
3
First introduction to food in Singapore and came with recommendations to try The Singapore Chilli Crab. We had a reasonably long wait for a table but the place is popular and we hadn’t booked. Great flavour, great atmosphere and great location, but very very messy to eat. They give you a “bib” to wear and a finger bowl but as hard as I tried I found myself covered in the sauce (and I’m really not a messy eater I promise!). It really would have been better if they also provided some napkins as I found myself so concerned about not getting the sauce on my clothes that it did detract from the enjoyment of the meal a little. It’s not a big ask and easily rectified and looking around at others I was not the only one as no matter how accomplished you are with chopsticks and getting the flesh out of a crab, the sauce is super runny. Great flavours though and unlike some of the recent reviews- we had no tummy upsets. All was pretty good, but not excellent....
5
I went this restaurant several times with my friends from oversea and never had any bad comment from them. Chili crab is excellent and I but I ordered Clams with yams which was not that great. However, overall sea food quality was excellent. For service and atmosphere, it is very big restaurant with many tourist so I kind of understand even though it was hard to call before. Anyway my guests are all satisfied so what else should I ask for
3
We were taken there our first night in Singapore. I did enjoy the chili crab and absolutely loved the rolls. But the prawns, scallops and tofu did not go over so so with me. I was sick with cramps and diarrhea for 3 days. I had to cancel some of my plans because I was between the bed and bathroom for days. I only had a few days here nb Singapore, but I have been afraid to eat anything else here while in Singapore. What so ironic is that I have a gut of steel. My husband also had diarreah for 2 days. Ruined my trip.
5
I was told I should taste the pepper crab in this restaurant so my company organized a dinner for some of us there. No regrets. Food was delicious and I would go there again if I had the chance.
4
This was our second times visit Jumbo food. The food was great and delicious as well as they were fresh. You can enjoy the view and have a wonderful dining experience here.
5
Nice food and good viewpoint at clarke quay, average $60/person. Recommend the chilli crab and mee goreng.
5
Always make time for our first meal here and never disappointed! Must book if you do not want to line up. We order the Chilli crab, pepper crab with the buns! Delicious...back soon!
4
We had a late lunch at the Jumbo seafood restaurant by the Riverside. We had chilli crab, drunken herbal prawns and seafood hor fan. They were delicious. The chilli crab did not disappoint by its reputation. The only let down was the service as we were being rushed to pay the bill after we had ordered food. The reason given was because they had to cash up at 3pm where the restaurant closes. We arrived at 2pm. Food was excellent.Service : average to goodThe Wise-Ones9th November 201

The food was nice, actually I liked Chili crabbut the server is so busy that they are not answering /serving our table. I requested one more set for tools but they rejected. also, they are not so nicely answered. I think one time visit is enough.
4
Excellent service. My mother was on wheelchair. One staff brought us to 2nd floor VIP room via the lift. Dedicated staff to each VIP room. Staff was attentive, polite and helpful. Full Marks!Food. Seafood was fresh. Full Marks!Cons. First two dishes, baby squids and yam ring with scallops were served lukewarm instead of piping hot. Dessert was mango puree with pamelo. Too much crushed ice in ratio. The opposite branch Riverwalk dessert has a generous dose of mango which gave customers a yummy experience
4
This is my first time been to this outlet. The food and service are good. As the place is too crowd, my hushand & I were told that we need to give up our table in an hour time. Only an hour to consume our food, so is a bit rush. I preferred the outlet at East Coast Park.
5
We had avoided Jumbo because it is always so busy and 'touristy'. We had some friends visit and they wanted to go.... We wish we had gone earlier now. The food is great. Service is a little slow due to the number of people always in the restaurant. Always book ahead so you can be sure to get your table when you want it. Wine list is ok but not huge
5
My family and I went to Jumbo Riverside Point to treat my brother in law with the famous chili crab and prawn fried with cheese. The foods are super delicious with matching fried rice with egg. The service crews are very friendly and approachable. Everything is unforgettable and awesome. We will definitely come back and bring along our other freiends and relatives. Two thums up!!
4
Nice to sit outside and enjoy the seafood. We had crab in black pepper, very nice and fresh. The service is good, but beware: they serve you tea and peanuts without asking and later you find them on your bill.
5
My guest from oversea enjoyed very much. Love the food , place n very reasonable set menu. Will be bring more friends over next time
5
Very nice located directly on riverside the Jumbo offers great service and very good food. We tried the typical chili crab and it was really good. Would come back and recommend
5
Attentive, friendly and proactive service from the staff serving our table (12) and the manager Mr Andy Lau. Thanks them for making our guests enjoying the food and ambience.
5
both food and service could be described excellent. I think for the reservation service, there should have the option to choose the table
1
This is the worst seafood I have ever had in Singapore, you have to wait in the queue for one hour, then the waiters will treat you so bad! They brought a squid which was not fresh at all. I grew up near the sea and I know what's fresh and what's not fresh. Do not come to this restaurant, it's a waste of time and money!!!

Jumbo seafood has become as much a part of the to do list of every traveler to Singapore as a mandatory photo with the mythical Merlion statue. The ace up their sleeve is the the dish that has made them infinitely famous the Chilli Crab. That along with the pepper crab and other dishes like the bamboo clam make this place a must visit for every seafood lover. Seafood isn’t something that I go for (the smell is something I cannot get used to). I did try the chilli crab and the pepper crab (pictured in this post). Pleasantly surprised. The smell ain’t so bad when these guys do it. They offer both Alaskan as well as sri lankan crabs. The chilli is toned down and not that hot. Probably to cater to the large number of European guests that visit this restaurent. You’ll get as good or maybe just maybe better crab elsewhere but this combination of service food and ambience is what make jumbo so good.
3
This is one of a hundred tourist-focused places along Clark Quay, and does not have any particular redeeming features to set it apart from the others. The food was fairly standard Chinese seafood cuisine. My main gripe is that when the fish that we wanted had allegedly been sold out, the waitress immediately recommended another, and when we got the bill the fish cost us... US$50. My advice is to make sure you ask beforehand what the "market price" is. Rookie error
4
I noticed most customers ordered chilli crabs but do give the black pepper crabs a try too as they are equally good although they could be a bit spicy because of the black pepper but I personally love the black pepper crabs more than the chilli crabs. However do make a reservation if u are eating on a weekend (and Friday night) as the queues are long and the restaurant will "chase" you out if you are taking too long to finish your meal since there are always many others waiting for your table
2
Bad choice was made by us a family of 4 with 2 adults and 2 13 year olds. We waited in line with the ticket system that they have. You put your own details into an ipad and receive a number then you are told to wait in the waiting area. It is very busy and manners may not always be shown. That's ok, it's in a good location and it's recommended and we are looking forward to some good seafood ( mainly Singapore chilli crab). Our number is called out and we are ushered to our table. We are told we have 1 1/2 hours . Ok we say. We go about selecting drinks and food. The table's in a high traffic area and even the waiter is pushing on the back of my chair to squeeze passed. She's taking a short cut from the hungry guest waiting area. We can't draw the attention of any wait staff. they seem to be more interested in the large tables of Chinese tourists with multiple crab orders. 20 mins go by, we can order drinks. This waiter is the nicest of all and he's been working for 3 years part time. He's not allowed to receive any tips or the compulsory service charge. That all goes back to management. He would be sacked if he took a tip.Our meal arrives and the crab is good, not fantastic. We have 40 mins to go. The prawns tasted strange and they stank. My wife said I should send it back which I didn't for some unknown reason. Kids calamari was cold. Again we couldn't get anyones attention. It's a shame because it was our last meal of the 3 week holiday through Borneo and Singapore. We had simular and better meals in Kuching for $30. This Crap cost near $300. I new it would be a lot more but I expected it to be at least the same and fresh. I've been to Singapore a bunch of times and this is the worst meal.Even when we handed over our hard earned money there was no eye contact, no recognition, no thank you, nothing. They didn't care and that was obvious. They got their money

I like seafood at Jimbo Restaurant. This restauran is very delicious especially spicy crab and dessert. Next time I come to Singpore I will est at Jumbo again.
4
Short wait for table for two outside. Restaurant was busy but were quickly served. Big range of menu items primarily seafood. Nice cold Tiger beer!!
Well worth a visit but suggest pre-booking for busy times.
4
The Jumbo restaurant had a good food and good staff.
Of course for us we booked before 3 days so when we arrived just waiting 5 minutes and moved to table.
4
Delicious Chili Crab and Pepper Crab. We booked online thru website but it said it’s not available then we walked in and get the table easily. The service I got was excellent.
5
Food is excellent with great service and good atmosphere.Price should be reasonable.Will visit again at later date..
5
food was delicious , service perfect , nice experience for my first time at Jumbo seafood restaurant .
plan to make my family discover this place .

best chili crab in Singapore

best service
good for couples family and friends
jumbo seafood riverside

Read that you'll need to make a reservation, tried on the off chance that we might get a table and was asked if we minded sharing. This made a lovely interesting night meeting two other couples and sharing food.We had prawns and salt and pepper crab, both delicious. Service was good, we had to wait a while between courses but that suited us.Little expensive, but worth a visit
3
Wanting to try Chilli Crab while in Singapore, my husband and I tried Jumbo's Seafood [Riverside] can not really say the service was great, the Chilli Crab and Buns was pretty ordinary BUT the Special Fried Rice was definitely a winner and you only needed a small serve. When we go back next year, we will try somewhere different. Price was not too bad either
1
First, I like to say that I don’t find any pleasure in writing this negative review. However, the service was absolutely terrible and I don’t want you to have the same experience I did. The service really ruined it for us.The waiter hovers over your shoulder to make sure you tip them. It is something that I think is beyond rude. I take a little longer to sign the check because I calculate the tip on my phone. When I notice the waiter was hovering, I thought she needed something, so I asked her if I could help her. She told me she was waiting and I told her I give it her the check when I was done. She continued to hover…. It was awkward and left an awful taste in my mouth. On top of that, service during the meal was terrible. They don’t come around often and ignore you when you do. The tea doesn’t get refill that often (FYI, you pay for it - I’m ok with that, but they don’t tell you when they give it to you). Also, the arrival time between the dishes is somewhere between 10-15 mins. I think they knew we were foreigners and treated us differently. The two tables next to us was not treated that way.The food is at best average. I’ve been all over the world and have a deep love for all types of seafood. I’m also not hard to please. The carb is fresh and big, but the flavor was nothing special. I had the chilly crab and seafood fried rice. They put the crab in a sweet chilly sauce - nothing special. Price for the meal for two was around $97.50 for two dishes( Chilly Crab + Seafood Fried Rice + two teas + peanuts). Yes, they charge you for the tea and peanuts. We didn’t ask for them they just put it down and charge you for them. Honestly, we don’t mind paying for things. We just like to know what we are being charged for. End of the day, I tip the staff 15% even though they were beyond rude to me. I use to work as a waiter when I was in my teens. I know how hard the job is. I always tip, unless it is against custom to do so. Do yourself a favor and don't go here. There are a ton of great places to each in Singapore and they will treat you much better
3
Taiwanese friend wanted to try the chilli crab as she read about it online but found it a little too salty for her liking
3
Quality of food is very good, worth every penny and price is reasonable. Quality of Service is no match to that of food, staff doesn't know how to wait table. No much of decor as restaurant.
5
If you have even given a thought of skipping this place, then just don't read. Cause there's nothing to make you read that will tempt you to go there. If you haven't eaten there, then first eat and then look for comments.
3
I came here many times. Everytime we can enjoy Chili crab.
If there is more reasonable price, it will be the best !
5
Tip: Make reservation well in advance! Otherwise, it's usually a 2-3 (or more) hour wait without reservations any day of the week! This is not just applicable to this branch but all other Jumbo Seafood branches.I am basing my rating on taste and taste alone. Jumbo Seafood has attained quite a bit of renown because of its high quality and tasty seafood, especially its famous Singapore chilli crab. I recall frequenting the very first Jumbo Seafood at East Coast when they first started in the late '80s and even though several branches have opened since and jam packed with tourists and locals alike, I am glad that they maintained the same high quality in taste. Sure the busy-ness at this Riverside branch can be a nuisance and prices have gone up, service may appear to be a bit rushed (who can blame them when they are so busy all the time!) but its sure worth all that trouble! Remember, make reservation in advanced! Order the chilli crab for sure, the black pepper crab is a great alternative if you already had the chilli crab. Feasting on chilli crab can be messy (but its soooooooooooo delicious that you'd be licking your fingers!), so Jumbo provides disposable bibs to protect the mess from your clothes. There is also a public sink inside the restaurant where you can wash off any mess. Besides their famous crab dishes, try also the donut with seafood paste and crispy fried baby squid. Lots of other seafood and non seafood variety to choose from

A friend took me here when visiting Singapore for a few days because I had requested delicious crab! The location is very lovely and right by the river in the hustling area of Clarke Quay.  She had to make a reservation and we were seated promptly. We ordered chilli and black pepper crab, a couple of veggie dishes as well as prawns with pumpkin puree, scallops abd a few other side dishes. As she did all the ordering I can't comment on service however the food was delicious. There were six of us and everyone was well fed and happy. I much preferred the black pepper crab however LOVED the bread buns dipped in the chilli crab sauce. The ambience is typical of any nicer Chinese restaurant (plain in decor and loud with other diners). All dishes were placed in front of us piping hot and very quickly. All in all can't complain! Delicious seafood served quickly. All up it was maybe $50 SGD between the six of us so very reasonably priced
5
Went mainly to try the Chilli Crab. Lunchtime, so were able to get a table without a wait. Chilli Crab seemed a bit expensive, but we thought it was worth it, and same basic price as elsewhere in Singapore anyway. Also had scallops with broccoli and a noodle dish that were very good. Staff were very efficient and friendly. Would be very happy to eat here again
4
The restaurant has two sets for two people. I think It's much more convenient to choose one of them instead of picking the dishes one by one from the menu, and the set is pretty suitable for new customers like us as it includes the specialties of the restaurant and is not too many or too few for two people to eat. But it's quite a pity that the waitress told us that there were no small table upstairs when we asked to be seated on the second floor to have a better view of the river. Hope you can get some next time. A nice experience overall
5
Friends told us to eat here for the Chilli Crab but since we already tried that dish earlier we ordered Cereal Prawns and Fried Rice with Salted Fish and Chicken. The Cereal Prawns are to die for! Would come back again just for that dish. We also purchased a couple of the Chilli Crab premix sauces. Not only this restaurant but it seems you need to bring your own napkins in Singapore (excluding hotel restaurants). They charge for the tea and wet napkins so decline if don't want to pay
3
Had a nice evening at Jumbo Seafood. Ambience is nice at the waterside. Service was a bit poor, we had to wait some time to get a table. Crab is very nice, we had booth chilly and pepper. Both 1 kg. Price was high but acceptable. Really an experience. For shore an experience. BUT you need to see the bathroom after eating this
3
Food is great but crab is way iver priced! Service is also average as staff should be more concious of customers
4
It's a very popular restaurant and the food is very delicious, the serveice is nice, but the price is a little bit high
4
The chili crab was tasty and served to our liking. However service was a tad slow and sometimes we felt like the waitress just forgot about us.
5
Food taste awesome! I ordered chilly crab, cerial prawn, steamed rice same as many people ordered.
I'm so sad, I can't write review well in English.
I recommend!
4
Food is delicious and looks very well. And the view of riverside is beautiful. However, It's too crowded. And the dishware is not clean enough. Hope to improve.
5
Food is very good. My family and I enjoyed. We want eat again. AC is too cold. Price is OK too. I will tell my friend. I wish I can eat these food in GuangZhou.
1
Even though I made a reservation, I waited for my meal for an hour. And then clerks didn't help me quikly. It was so unconvienient.
2
I have had some Thai Friends over the last few days for conference and they extended a couple of days as 2 have never been to Singapore before. We had been doing the tourist thing during the day and had booked Jumbo for Chilli Crab in the evening by the river to give them the typical Singapore experience.Booked 1 week in advance, not very helpful but there you go. Turned up, yes we had a table but the first thing you get is you have to eat and get out in 90 minutes. For me if I had no guests I would have walked away. Considering the price you pay you shouldn't have to put up with this. You then get this tatty bit of plastic stuck in the middle of the table with your departure time....I knew before we even got any food it wasn't going to be fresh and low and behold 5 minutes after ordering all but one of our dishes were dropped in the middle of the table. There wasn't even room so the servers is trying to combine 2 dishes on one plate. Food was clearly not fresh, luke warm at best, since when can you get a cooked crab in 5 minutes. The craziest part was when the last dish, cereal prawns turned up it was about 60 minutes later, clearly they had been cooking for 60 minutes as it took another 15 minutes to chew them as they were like rubber..The only decent part sadly about the whole time was the tiger beer staff were the most attentive and friendly I have ever seen..As I mentioned this isn't even a cheap place, 200 SGD for Boston Lobster per Kg, 150 for local lobster. The biggest crab they have is 400g..We have always said now there is no difference between the different seafood restaurant brands in town but Jumbo, at least this outlet, has set a new benchmark for appalling attitude to customers, terrible quality of food and lack of a friendly atmosphere.Sad to see things getting even worse than before on the service front.
3
All know this as a place to go to and try chilli crab (as we did). Bit dissappointing. Loads of tourists and very simple ambiance. The food was ok but not like 'can we go back tomorrow'. Overrated for what you get as a food experience
3
If you do not have reservations, you would have to sit at a designated area out front and wait for a table. We booked via the Chope app, but even then, the earliest time slot available for dinner was 9.15 pm! And thatâ€™s on a Tuesday night! We ordered the chilli crabs and black pepper crabs. The latter tasted really good but the highlight gotta be the crabs themselves, which were succulent and meaty
5
nice food and good service, with some great view , strongly recommend to friends who are looking for an excellent seafood dining experience .
3
With very nice view on the canal, this place has fast and effective service.
Wide choice of crab origins and spices.
It is not perfect, but it's very decent and you surely will enjoy it!
4
Jumbo seafood restaurant is very good reservation system very excellent but beacuse of many people staff very busy
4
All my guest will want to visit this jumbo whenever they visit singapore.Good food,Good Crabs and consistent taste with quality.
Slightly on the high price.But it still worth the amount spend.
Advance booking is advise due to overwhelmed crowd during dinner.
5
The food is fresh, of high quality and delicious. The staff are very friendly and helpful. We definitely will come back!
5
Ambience and service were good. Happy dining there. Family was satisfied with the food too.
Thank you.
3
Ordered the chili crab. The crab's really nice, fresh, and sweet but I guess the taste is too sweet and too overwhelmed with tomato. Guess it's just not my type of
2
Yes the food is good , crab are well presented and portion is generous; service is like any mid range restaurant (too loud for me ). All considered We spent 229 SGD for 1 Crab x 2 i: half with pepper and half alaska style+ 2 beer and 1 appetizer !!! what do you think ? I would not recommend it too much over the average you could spend in Singapore for the same food ...absolutely overrated !!!
4
It's a disheartening to know that Sri Lankan crab supply is so reduced that Jumbo can no longer serve them at a dinner reservation, at 6PM on Thursday. We were served mud crab which is similarly meaty but smaller. It tastes good as usual. Luckily the bamboo clam is still available.
5
We visit Jumbo already several times and still love it. This time we visit the Riverside outlet. We booked a week in advance (necessary) and had a lovely terrace place along side the Singapore River Boulevard. As alllways we took a chili and a black pepper crab. Together with a good and affordable wine we had a lovely evening. Go there
3
convenient, well located and will be well connected to the city by an array of public transportation options. worker very friendly
2
I made reservation for terrace seat, but reservation is not guaranteed without any comment. Also service quality was poor. Too clowded. No need to select this restaurant for chilli crab.
2
Chili crab was very delicious but It was so disappointed for unkind staff and chargable tea, glove, etc..
2
Maybe it was just a matter of poor selection of menu items but the meal for 4 people was very ordinary and overpriced.Table location was excellent and service was OK without being special.Would NOT go back again when considering how many other restaurants are around that area
4
Wanted Singapore chilli crab. Have been to Red House and seen mixed reviews about Jumbo, but this one on Clarke Quay served a beautifully messy and yummy version, Has some Vietnamese sugar cane skewered prawn, and a stir fried venison dish. All execellent.Only curiousity was that we started at about 2, and before 3 they were shoving the bill under my face and vaccuming around us, even with some other guests there. On the other hand, when I got my friend to pay the bill (my hands too sticky!), and asked whether they wanted us to go outside to finish our wine (Mumm), they were like "No, humid out there; stay as long as you like". Think mama in charge just wanted to count her takings. They do close between lunch and dinner.But service otherwise good, and food really really yummy. Would go bsck; just arrive 30 mins earlier
5
Last week I came to have lunch at Jumbo Riverside, even I didn't make reservation first but they serve me quick and prepare a nice table for me.I always dine at Jumbo every time I visit SingaporeTheir Chilly Crab is taste so (˘ڡ˘) yummy. The fried mantouw is a perfect company with the crab.I never taste a more tasty chilly crab compare with Jumbo Chilly Crab.The price is worthy. I also buy their ready made sauce so I can make a chilly crab my self at home
5
No trip of mine to Singapore is ever complete without a good cracking at Jumbo. Been visiting this place for years now and they do serve the best! Only downside is the waiting if you don't have a reservation... so my advice is never go in as a walk-in diner but make a reservation well in advance, especially if it's a weekend. However, the new electronic walk-in reservation kiosk at the restaurant also allows you to come there and collect a number, and you will be informed via SMS when the table is ready... So you could maybe walk about in the area while you wait...Their must-try's are Chilli Crab with fried buns, salted egg prawns, stir fried venison and seafood fried rice

Fortunately we had booked otherwise quite a wait as it is very busy and popular particularly as it is Singapore GP this week.I went with friends who live in Singapore so they knew what to order as the Menu is daunting with some many choices. We had Chilli Crab, a speciality. Egg coated prawns (delicious) and special little fried buns.Service very efficient and friendly
5
Actually after the debacle I had at No Signboard. I did not give up to find a great place to eat black pepper crab. I looked up on the web and found Jumbo. Obviously we didn't book and waited about 30 mins for a table. It would have been quicker if we wanted to share. The did have the local crab (unlike some other places). We also ordered the scallop in a Yam ring. They were excellent. The crab tastes very succulent and sweet. The service was good ...
2
The food what I got was truly good. But this place is so industrialized that I felt like a single part of a process. It has no atmosphere and I didn't feel good at all while i was there. "Eat, pay, and get out" place, no recommendation from me
4
I feeling good restaurant conditing and very kindly staffs.
Fistly, Very good food and using fresh seafood.
Very very nice.
I will come back to your restaurant next year.
Thank you for your hospitalty.

We booked a private room for company event. Multiple waiters went out of way to be rude and demeaning to our group, including our overseas guests.
4
Been visiting this Jumbo outlet for many years. As usual, food was good and the ambient was nice in the airconditioned area upstairs.
3
Food taste was not bad. I recommend to eat chili crab with fried rice and fried shrimps. But hygiene was not good. And also it was really hard to get the service.
4
We ordered dishes that were originally within budget but they ran out of two of the dishes, that were more kid-friendly. We ended up having to order 2 other main dishes and bill came up to more than $600 for 8 pax.
4
Many options of how to have your crab. Plenty of other options also but we basically went there for the crab. Prices are what you expect for crab
5
Good soon hock fish. Cutter fish roll taste great. Seafood is nicely cook. Mango sago dessert taste of nice. Servers are well trained and polite. Decoration is average.

If you want to be treated like a number this is the place. The only person who seemed to care they had any customers was the drink lady!!  I am from San Francisco--famous for our crab. I really wanted to taste and enjoy the experience of chili crab.  The sauce is great. Crab was mixed review. Some bites were tender some were dry. We ordered three things. The asparagus came out 20 minutes before the crab. We asked that the other side come with the crab.... but it didn't.Extremely disappointing.If you aren't on the deck close to the water it has no atmosphere. We we in the deck but at a two top right in top of another couple. I fret like we were eating with them.
1
Food was ok but no where near $132 for two main meals and a jug of coke! They even had the nerve to charge us for peanuts they put on our table. Menu is in English but prices are in Mandarin which highlights the deceit. They can see tourists coming a mile away.
1
Disappointing and poor service. Our waitress was rude on several occasions. Throwing replacement plates onto the table in front of us like we were at a prison camp, making contemptuous faces when asking for gloves, the check, etc. overall a stressful experience. Will not return or recommend. Chili crab was so so.
5
Everything is good
I will never forget the memory there.
One employee was very kind and good.
Thanks to the staff, I could eat more delicious food.
4
Good food as usual and must try includes Chilli / pepper crab and cereal prawn (deshelled i.e. Prawns without shell, perfect for kids). Price is on the rise though...
4
Typical singapore seafood restaurant offers live seafood cooked to perfection or eaten raw as in lobster sashimi. Chill crabs are a must. This typical Singapore's favourite dish uses large Sri Lankan crabs that are fattened further in special cages before being sold .
3
Food is good,
But price is bad.
Too expensive and poor service.
If you have enough money, go. But not, I suggest another place more than good place.
5
We ordered signature chilli crab,cereal prawn,seafood fried rice. It was super nice and delicious. Especially the chilli crab sauce was awesome with fried bun!!!!
3
Chili crab was a new experience for us. Nice, good taste, but expensive. Service was ok, but not too fast. You also got the feeling of a dispatch.
4
It is very good seafood and tasty even though expensive..it is worth it, but do not expect fine dining, it is very casual..
4
Walking distance from the Clark quay MRT. We walked in around 730pm,and got a table outside in one hour,it has very nice view along the river in the evening. Can also hear the music made by street musician from the bridge next to the restaurant.We ordered chili crab,the crab quality is very good, fresh and fat,however the gravy is a little bit too much sweet to me. The vegetables are ok, but the fried rice is not good, not recommended.the waiters and waitress are all very busy, not that attentive. They gave us two small side dishes as starters,also tea,but they didn't say they are free not till I saw the bill, this is not good. Two adults and one kid cost around $199,pricey dinne
2
Waited and hour and a half in the humidity for this famous chilli crab, staff were rushed of their feet and not very friendly, after waiting that long and given a time we have to be finished and out by! I found anoying, you are forced to get a kilo only at certain times even if it's more than you want. And took ages to get drinks we had to re order. In saying this my partner very much enjoyed the chilli crab and said best crab he's had. I also enjoyed my food but the overall experience just wasn't great.
5
We got 11 medium sized crabs for 11 people.. sounds like a lot, but every bite was savoured. The chili crab was spicy, but perfect with the mini buns. The non-spicy options, such as the garlic one, was amazing as well. The oatmeal shrimp was actually my favorite: crispy and savoury and sweet at the same time.For a large group, I would recommend sharing the bigger crabs and ordering a lot of buns. Kind of pricey, but perfect for the occasion.
5
Chilli crab can be pricey but worth the taste. The Black Pepper Crab is also recommended and just as finger-licking good.
4
My family ate Chiily crab, cereal prawn. Chilly crab sauce was very dilicious, My daughter don't like prawn, but liked cereal prawn very much.
4
Very glad that Jumbo has been maintaining its standard. Very good Singapore Chilli Crab and service was good too despite its popularity.
4
This was my second experience with Jumbo (and second location) and my thoughts remain the same. The food is delicious, if expensive. We weren't very hungry, so only ordered 1 kg of chili crab, sauteed asparagus, and about 5 buns, and it came out to be $125 SGD. The chili crab and black pepper crab are really an experience that should not be missed, and I don't know anywhere that does them better than Jumbo. However, because of their raging popularity, expect to wait a LONG time and then wait again for service on the inside. The place was so busy that the servers were running around constantly, and it was difficult to catch the attention of one. Once your food is ordered, don't expect to see your server again for a good while. It took 15 minutes to get the bill at the end.Despite this, I will probably continue to visit Jumbo and would definitely recommend the experience at least once to any visitors to Singapore
5
I made a reservation when I heard that it was difficult to eat unless I had booked. At first, like Korea, I do not like 5 people because 4 recognition bases are basic. Though I thought, most of them were round tables. When I made a reservation, I commented that I liked the river side with the comment, but I gave it to the outdoor river place precisely. I was very happy and my family liked it all. Chili crab is perfect for Koreans in Singapore. The fried rice was a little sour and the cereal shrimp was a bit disappointing because the children refused to eat their shells, but it was a very new and delicious taste for adults to eat
5
It is a well known restaurant in Singapore that specializes in Chilli Crab. They also serve black pepper crab if you want to give it a try. Cereal prawns are as well a must try. The restaurant is located near Clark Quay MRT and is accessible by foot. It is expected to be a crowded place during peak hours so better make that reservation.
5
I ended up eating here twice in a week. Obviously the main intention was to introduce Singapore-style crabs to my foreign colleagues. We tried chilli crab and black pepper crab. Black pepper was the unanimous winner for the majority of us. I personally like the black pepper crab better too
3
We had to keep asking for refill of water and tea. Even though so, most of the time, the waiters/waitresses, never came back, ignoring or forgotten our request. We also wanted to order a bowl of rice but was told that last order had closed. No one came to us to ask if there were any last orders
3
I have been in jumbo restaurant for the second time. but, i am not satisfact this time. staff was didn't give to us bill for english, so we requested for english bill. but we was refused. Besides, staff missed our already ordered. globes, food, etc... i hope these things improve until i go to jumbo restaurant next time.Thank you
4
They open at 12 sharp. We were early and had to wait outside. Must ask for air con seating if not they will place you outside and it will be too warm. Also need to make reservation. The chilli crab is excellent. The portion of the food is very small. Need to order medium or large for 4 people. Price is on the expensive side around s$50 per person.
5
Preety good experience!
We like the flavor of foods, especially the chilly crab.
The location is good, which is located in Clarke Quay and near theSingapore river. The atmosphere is wonderful。
4
very very nice view and taste of crab and seafood rice:) and i will visit one more. because i want eat another food
1
Terrible customer service
Waiter is so not professional, store manager is even worst
Who will ever wait customer to clean their hands three times to pay the bill when the customer is still trying to eat!! Gosh
5
I visted this restaurant with my family. My family was satisfied with foods. Most of all Chily Crab was very delicious! I never forget its tast.
5
By far, this is THE BEST Chili Crab I've ever tasted! So fresh and the gravy is to die for! The seafood Hokkien Meehoon was so delicious. Will definitely come back the next time I go to Singapore.
4
Book if you'd like to turn up later than 6pm! This is popular, and rightly so. The chilli crab is a must. But all their seafood is great. Not a big menu - but everything is done well.
2
I went with my 61 yrs mom, 3 and 5 yrs nieces and my sister. We arrived there early like 5:40PM. We booked at 6PM but the table was available, so we ordered. We waited, waited and waited for more than 30 mins. It shouldn't be this slow. I had a really good experience there twice for 4-5 years ago. However, my third time was extremely disappointed!!
5
The chili crabs were not too spicy and good for those who do not take very spicy food. Those crabs were delicious and still lingering in my mind as I write. We ordered about 6 dishes and all of them tasted very good. Satisfied with their standard and quality food. That is why it is packed all the time. We came on a Saturday night and waiting time was 1 and 1/2 hours. Though it was a hot day, we were seated outdoor and there were still some breeze at night.
4
Although I had to wait for a queue for 1 hour but I think it's worth to wait.Actually you can book for a table on website but I didn't reserve any tables before then I need to wait around 1hour on Saturday night which I don't think it's too long time to wait.Chilli crab with buns is superb. I recommend you guys to try Fried Kang Kong very very nice dish..Although there are many customers at that time their service was really good
4
Food and service is very good. but, table time is very short. We have time is just 1:15. And the food came out late. So me and my friend was in a hurry while I ate food. Except for the table time, I was satisfied. Thanks
4
I reserved a table of four one month before my trip. Although we waited for roughly 10 minutes past our booking time, the staff were very helpful and friendly. Will use the booking service again.
5
Excellent. Had both the chili and pepper crab, both superb. Very moist. Scallops also great, as was the prawns with garlic. Cannot fault the food at all - perfection. And have been eating chili crab in Singapore for 40 years...
4
Every time I have overseas visitors I always take them and they always love the experience at Jumbo.
4
It is my second time to go to this restaurant. Good seafood, great atmosphere. Price is slightly on expensive side but that is within expectation from previous experience and reviews. Quite popular and need to follow the reserved time slot up to the minutes, Want to eat early and avoid peak but failed. Obviously, 6pm is still the time of peak for this restaurant. Need to wait at least 1 hr if you are group of 4. It probably drive away some guests without prior planning. Going for special occasions should be alright as it should be planned.
4
Dined there on Saturday 29 July with family. The food was smashing. The wine was excellent. The service was immaculate. But the place is so popular that you have a 1.5 hour table limit. As such, as immaculate as the service was, one couldn't help but feel you were in a production line and people would be pleased to see the back of you. A pity because it takes the shine off experiencing some really yummy food
1
What is free of charge and what is not has to be notified to the customer in advance. Peanuts they set in the table as if we can eat for free, and the extra teas that I and my friend ordered 2 times more and The waiter didn't say anything about it were all charged and we came to know that when we got the receipt. This ruined all enjoyful taste of chili crab and clams. Felt like they deceived me and we could not even try to complain about it because I guess they have already written all those information on the menu paper. But not everyone checks it. Should the customer read the menu thoroughly before ordering? I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone because their sales philosophy s*cks
3
I really wanted to try the chilli crab for my birthday so went there. There is a bit of a wait, even on a Monday, if you do not have reservations. service is nil. they need the table so the service offered is to get you done and out. I dont mind the wait, but once you have waited an hour and finally get a table, a bit of niceties will be appreciated. the food is nothing to write about (excuse me for writing!) The chili crab is very sweet. But it was my first time having it so maybe that is how it is supposed to be. I would not go back there for the food thats for sure. Costs a lot. the only plus is the location. I do not fail this place, but have to say that it did not impress me at all
5
I tried several versions of chili crab around Singapore but this one is the best so far. We also ordered several dishes and they are all equally good. The rates are quite expensive but it is worth it, take note that they sell crabs by weight and origin. I would also like to commend the staff for good customer service. I can't wait for my next visit.
5
It's a famous Restaurant in Singarpor, we made reservation before, so when we got there already left the seat for us. It's so fresh and delicous, we are so happy had a family dinner at here, during the night the view is also amazing, really recommend come to here.
3
After experiencing several restaurants in Singapore we came to try the famous Chili Crab.Although is not bad I can't say it is great.What really surprised me was the cost. $220 Singapore dollars. The restaurant is not fancy or well decorated. The tables and chairs are more for a cafeteria
5
Chili Crab is super delicious, can't wait to try it again~~~~~also, hope will cheaper in future^_^ laaaaa
3
Positive
- food was yummy and served hot
- staff were friendly and accommodative
- good ambience
Negative
- utensils were dirty even after swapping
5
The food all good, fresh, waiter and waitess are all kind. Offered baby chair, and the atmosphere is nice.
1
The waiter received a bad order. Also, we waited very very long for some change and other waiters did not listen to us. I would never recommend this restaurant to others.
4
The steamed crab tastes good and the environment is good, but there are a lot of ants that want to improve, and the service charge and taxes are a little high. Everything else is fine.
3
Jumbo restaurant I’ve dined at 4 times. Now with tripadvisor I can record this account:1. Bambo Clams are $112 for 7 people2 Soon Hock fish cost $90 steamed. If you get the Star Grouper - thats a whopping $215 per Kilo.3. One Black Pepper crab which they say feeds 2 people - actually feeds 4 people that eat moderately will cost $784. Venison cooked in Black Pepper will cost $335. Kang Kong with Garlic $216. Beancurd with Seafood7. Jug of Soursop juice - $22.Total Bill of $500 for 7 people. Can get cheaper across the border. I also ordered a dish and the waitress ordered something else. English is not good here by the order takers and is overly single country focussed and it's not Singapore.Service is ok and could be quicker however their service is focussed on moving people out as dining slots are very specific and restaurant management are trying to seat as many as possible. There are quite a few people who turn up without bookings so the team are working hard to move you out of the restaurant quickly. They said indoor seating only starts at 6pm and not 5:30pm.A good feed here and another option is No Sign Board at Geylang.In all, we decided not to come back here anymore as they place has just become a tourist restaurant and not for locals
3
We had to wait more then an hour to seat in this super trendy restaurant but the booking system to be fair was very good!! People serving us was very angry and never smiled and remind us we had to leave the table in an hour! So we ordered fast even we had to call the waitress 3 times to order but then we wait 20 min to be served!! We are fast and to be fair the crab was very nice but no serviette to clean your hand and even when we asked they gave us stingy just a couple!!Bill was high for the food we ate and for the service we had but we payed for sure for the location and for the name!! I'll not come back but I can really recommend for the best crab!
4
I've always liked the food in Jumbo. The only challenge sometimes is for someone who doesn't speak chinese, it can be challenging to converse at times.But not a big issue as they do have people who are quick to attend to your needs.Will always go back to the restaurant to satisfy my cravings :-
5
We first tried o get in on a Sunday night, but there was an hours wait for casuals. We went for lunch 3 days later, and were given a seat straight away. We had king prawns rolled in pumpkin purée, and king prawns in salted egg, together with a Chinese spinach dish. All were excellent, and the service was very good. Recommended
4
Went to have lunch with my sister's so we didn't order much. A black pepper crab, a chilli crab and cereal prawns.The cereal prawns are really very good, sweet and crispy. I don't do chilli crab quite often though it's one of my favourite. I wished it was more spicy though, but perhaps it's toned down for the tourists. The most surprising dish to me was the black pepper crab. It's peppery and buttery at the same time. Very yummy. No wonder it's packed with tourists :-) Try to get an indoor seat next time. Singapore has not much of a river view :-
1
I ate a Chili Crab at Jumbo Restrant Riverside Point. The price was SD 554 for a Alaskan King Crab.
Incredibly expensive.
5
chili crap and fried rice is very delicious! if my friends visit singapore, i vitally recommand jumbo!
5
Great Chilli crab, it's hot, it's salty, it's impressed in every way. It costs about 70S$ but it's worth the price.
Highly recommended restaurant!
5
The best chilli crab to date. Exceptionally tasted king prawns. Unexpected for a place in the middle of a busy touristic area. A great vibe overall with pleasant and very helpful staff.
5
I did not count how many times I went Jumbo Seafood, it was again again fantastic! Crab with a special souce you have to try it. It was cult! Was delicious and tasty. I will never forget...
3
Jumbo Seafood Riverside is no longer good as compared to the past. Further, the order taker keep on pushing expensive dishes especially if you have guests.
5
When in Singapore Jumbo Seafood is a must, the chilli crab and venison black pepper are absolutely amazing.
4
At Jumbo is a must to try the chilli crabs with the mini bun. The black pepper crabs also is a must to try. Price are reasonable and the restaurant in East Coast is a good place to walk after feeling up the stomach
5
Absolutely amazing! I didn't enjoy seafood so much for long time! Everything was incredibly tasty. I have been to this restaurant last night to celebrate my 30th birthday and I will never forget it. If you visit Singapore, Jumbo Seafood Riverside is a must!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
4
Went there last weekend, have a fabulous dinner. I'm not a fans of chilli crab but I must say their chilli crab is very delicious. Only thing that disappoints me was the food was server warm and not hot. Overall very is perfect, nice view and nice foods.
5
We have been to this restaurant for umpteen times. Each time we have an overseas guest, Jumbo is the only place we will bring him/her to.
3
The waiters only give 'special' & immediate attention to tables ordering red wine, they were slow serving us tea despite our repeated request for tea replenishing
2
We ordered five kinds of dishes, all tasteless. over priced, and waitress are not friendly. The only good thing was it located on the riverside with a nice view.
2
Dined here with friends last night and can't figure out why this place is so busy. The food is average and you will find much better in the food stalls. Service was terrible and trying to get anything was a nightmare. Food also way overpriced for what you get. Was very disappointing.
3
Enjoy seafood in a friendly environment next to Clarke Quay and its lights of party in the evening Food is of decent quality and the world famous crabs, be it pepper or chili will delight youBe ready to queue a bit though as this is a very good location to dine casuallyEnjoy a taste of Singapore!Bon appétit
5
Pepper crab good, chilli crab a bit too tomato ketchupy for our taste. Busy restaurant on Clarke Quay. Nice to sit outside and lots of atmosphere. Book online so you don´t have to wait in line for an hour. Now we have discovered Momma Kong´s probably wouldn´t go back to Jumbo but nothing wrong with it
4
They say try the Black pepper crab! The uber cabbie that picked us up from Changi recommended Jumbo for this world famous crab. First night.....qued, we were told to vacate the table at 7:15pm, we were seated at 6 pm. We waited for the crab for 45 ish mins (long time) massive crab, partially broken shells, they gave us bibs(handy) bowl to wash hands and off we scoffed our crab. Being a tourist, we follow directions and the 7:15 pm minute made us nervous a bit.it was epic, messy, hard work, lots of muscles to crack the shells and fun and best of all yummy!!!I think waiting for 45 mins for a crab when you have seating time limits is a bit too much and affected us trying hard to enjoy the meal. I didn't fancy being rushed in enjoying my meal, it really just dampens and affects my enjoymentand experience of the meal. No time for pleasantries, it's like savages jumping for the meal, like the second it landed the table, the timer was on! Jumbo is very famous so I can see why they limit seating times. Oh try not to look at the aquariums outside, for animal lovers, this will put you off dinner. They're just state ng the fact that they only serve fresh foods.Recommendation? Cue early, know what you want by asking for the menu while waiting,and muscles to physically crack open the shell (u still need muscles to use the shell cracker even though the crab has been partially cracked
1
The crab is good. Pepper crabs takes 45 minute to cook while chilli crab just 15 minutes. The hotel has a huge waiting list and on a Friday night you are likely to wait for one hour. Table sittings along the canal have a good view while tables inside have no view. Service is not attentive. You feel treated like cattle more than on a expensive restaurant. Food is not better than that served at a local hawker yet more expensive. So if you can get a good table riverview and no need to wait is ok otherwise plenty of bettet choices along the canal with better servic
1
Need to wait for over one hour . Have tables alomg the river quite nice yet inside tables have no view. Service is bad and tell lies. Food is ok speciality is the chilli crab which is as good as the chilly crab served elsewhere in Singapore. Crab plus dessert plus pumpkin soap usd 120. Not worth the wait for bad service without view . Will not retur
2
We have eaten here before on previous trips to Singapore (as well as their original restaurant on East Coast Parkway). The service was terrible (we were basically ignored for 30 minutes after being seated). Our food (3 dishes) came out each 10 minutes apart. We had to ask times for our check so we could leave. Very very disappointing. Won't go back again. There are too many other choices
5
Food is great and chilli crab is a must. Service staff is all very accommodating and out to please. Excellent!
2
Went there with a couple of friends. .. food was 5/10 at best... missing dishes from the order and generally over priced. Would welcome suggestions on other places to go because I won't go back
1
Great food shocking service. 1 persons meal served after everyone else in the group had finished eating. Then waiter kept hanging around until eventually asked us to leave even though the last person served had not finished.
3
I went there 3 times whenever visit Singapore. Food was very good. But people who served was not kind.
4
The food was very tasty! We got the chili crab with seafood fried rice + fried mantou. Service was very very slow, however.
4
this is one of iconic restaurant at singapore... make sure you try the chili crab... a bit expensive but it is worth to try... remember to make reservation before you came... expect long queque
5
Delicious food, excellent service and beautiful view but a little bit expensive. Will recommend others go to Jumbo
3
We went to Riverside Jumbo, because of more table and better view compare to the one in Boat Quay. On 25 Jun, we can't reserve due to too many reservation. Note also this restaurant open their reservation thru website also. We were given a number from the counter and waited around 40mins. They called us when our number is up. Upon ordering the waiter was offering us drinks, as a frequent customer here, we prefer to have water/tea which are complimentary. Unfortunately, it seems the waitress was forcing us to order bottled water, which is not free of course. After a bit of stand-off she finally provided us with the water. The rest of the evening went well. All of the food was marvelous
4
This place is very well known by the locals because it prepares the famous Chilli or Pepper Crab dish, a giant crab cooked with very tasty pepper or chilli sauce. We tried the chilli version and ended up quite satisfied. Full of flavour and big enough for two persons if you want to share one. Recommended to be served along with some rice.Be aware that it is so popular that you need to queue up outside unless you have made your reservation beforehand
4
Our customer is known to love seafood. So we decided to bring him to this iconic seafood restaurant at Riverside Point.We had chili crab, black pepper crab, steamed fish, herbal drunken prawns, coffee spare ribs, tofu with mushroom, and seafood fried rice. We end the dinner with teochew ohni (yam paste dessert). The ohni was very smooth in texture and yet not greasy on the palate.Overall a very yummy and satisfying dinner
4
I visitied with mom. She liked it. Taste good, Nice view. Most of people was kind. But Slow service.
4
Crabs were marvellous, large and juicy. Comes at a premium price of course. Enjoyed the scenary and food at Jumbo Riverside!
2
There are many Korean customers. The price is high. Servers are not friendly. We didn't eat nuts and didn't drink tea but we can see the price on our receipt.
4
Food was really amazing. Had a good time overall but the waiter was quite rude and felt like he was rushing us to order rather than helping to explain the menu.
4
this is third time I visited the jumbo restuarant, my family and me enjoyed dinner june second that food is delicious, many people were aroud me, I had a good time with my family.
4
It was great to experience the Singaporean Chilli Mud Crab, but was expensive for what you get. Other than that the food was great, and the service was also great considering they were fairly busy. Great location too!
2
Generally the food was good but abit pricy as it is more for tourist. The service by the lady waitress was good and they change the plate quite often, which is good as we need to disposed off the crab shell.However, the waiter (guy) which I failed to get his name have serious attitude problem. We had five of us and the counter asked if we are okay with 4 tables seat and will add on additional chair at the side. Seeing the long queue we agreed with that. However, when we go in, they asked the 3 of us to squeeze into the sofa seat bearing it mind that it should only fit two person. When we asked for additional seat at the side, we got rude reply and only after some commotion the seat was added. I don't understand why they can't just joined the 4+2 seater table which is available just beside for us. Feel disgusted to pay such price and receive these services
3
Food was good as usual. But what puts me off from going to Jumbo more often (have been going since I was a kid) is that nowadays the service is terrible. The manager is very rude, very dismissive and does not want to reply to your queries (even rolled his eyes several times at us). They force you to order more, food comes so fast, then you are chased out
4
Asked several locals where to eat Chili Crab and the response was always Jumbo. We ate at the location close to Clarke Quay. The crab was good, but no better than can be found in a Hawker center and much more expensive. The location is excellent as the restaurant is close to Clarke Quay. If you want to try Chili Crab without the hassle of ordering at a Hawker center I would recommend Jumbo
5
We ordered Sweet Chilli mud crab and it was the best with fried bread. Even sautÃ©ed Garlic green vegetables was amazing. Great staff & good service ones you're seated. Make sure you are willing to wait for a table because it is very popular. It is worth the wait I'd go & eat there anytime.
2
The restaurant was too busy, so the restaurant staff was hard to provide good service. It was very expensive.
4
Located on the riverside with a nice view looking over the bridge - great spot for a great meal. Beware hands will get dirty. Enjoy!!
3
We ordered one chili crab maybe 1.3 kilos, then fried rice and two drinks. In total costs us SGD170 but we really feel the chili crab doesn't worth that much....
4
All of the dishes were flavoursome especially the chilli crab , service was very fast and efficient. It's by the river but not a good river view , aesthetically the surroundings are not great but the food is good.
4
Nice restaurant located at riverside. For dining you need to make reservation prior your dining, or you can just come to there and make reservation, then wait for couple hour until you get place. Recommended menu was chilli crab and black pepper crab with mantou.
4
First, the taste was very good. I could make a reservation in advance and eat easily. However, this may be a cultural difference, but I was unhappy about giving peanuts or tea without saying that I had to pay money.

Must try the chilli crab, it's a busy restaurant so make sure you have a reservation. The food is outstanding and the service is very good. They have a good variety of alcohol available.

We dined here recently as part of a short stop over before heading on to Japan.I have been to Singapore several times before but never dined here. It had always been booked out and /or big line ups with people waiting.We thought we'd try again and managed to get a table, just as a walk in, no booking required.Obviously i was keen to order the Chilli Crab and it was everything i expected and more, absolutely delicious! Got to wear one of their famous bibs as it can be quite a messy experience, but overall an excellent dining experience. I highly recommend going

This place is great for seafood as the special is the chilli crab! Goes well with wither steamed or deep fried mantou (bread).The other dishes like the seafood mee goreng was nice. The cereal prawn was excellent and the seaweed toufu was exquisite!Ambience was great as its by the Singapore river, Clarke Quay stretch which is extremely scenic!Only drawback was the space within tables in which is very tight which affected the dining mood a little. If it was not for this, it would be a 5 star rating

We were invited by a local to try Jumbo or chilli crab which is a specialty by jumbo as well as a famous dish for Singapore. Queues here can get very long and waiting can take a while. There were 3 of us and they had a table for 6 free with 3 people already sitting. This is the norm in Asia, sharing tables with others. You are given a time you have to finish by which is around an hour and a bit. It may seem a long time by chili crab is a slow process of breaking and separating the meat from the shell. We ordered 2 crabs some vegetables,fried buns and rice and our bill was just over $250 sdg!!!!! I was so shocked. This was for 3 people with no drinks! We did over stay the "time limit" as my partner is a bit slow in eating but being told you have over stayed and its time to leave whilst still eating and then being handed a bill for $250 is absolutely ridiculous. The food was good, but as in all Chinese restaurants, food comes at different times and service is poor as its more about turn around than quality of food and service. A shame for a place with good chili crab. Not recommended
4
We went there for lunch on a recent visit to Singapore, chili crab was delicious, we enjoyed eating it with the view of the river in the distance, the place to go for chili crab if you are in the area.
5
very good!! The food was delicious and I want to visit again.
The chihi crab that eat while looking at thr river was fantastic!
4
The food here is really very good, in a great location. Staff can be a little abrupt and the food is expensive. But the soft shell crab is amazing.
4
I ordered about live crab black pepper and steam minibun, I think it's very delicious for me. The crab is already cracked out and it's easy to pick off. Also minibun is easy to eat and can dipped with the black pepper sauce too!
5
It was a fantastic flavor. Next time iif i go there i would order same thing! And also it has a nice view of clarkey
4
We have enjoyed the food although we had time limits when we had to finish. I wish we weren't rush to eat.
5
The best seller crab menu was amazing and the location by the river is great ! But the price is a bit expensive but worth trying :)
5
The chilli crab here is excellent - however probably less spicy and more sweet than some other branches around the Chinatown area. Definitely worth a visit though as the atmosphere is very nice and it is air-conditioned. More expensive than other places, but you are paying for dining in a nice restaurant. Food came out reasonably quickly, although we went well over the 1hr we were told to eat within as food only arrived 30m into that hour. Make sure you know what you want and order straight away. Try the chilli crab (with mantau on the side), and cereal prawns
3
We failed to eat here in two previous occasions. So this time we book 1 week in advance to ensure a table for 9 person.Environment---------The environment is touristy as it's on the busy and famous riverside. You have option to dine outside to enjoy the riverside view of air conditioned inside. So mention your preference when booking, and pray for no rain if you want to dine outside.Food ----We ordered "must have" Chilli Crab with buns, Drunken Prawn, Veg, Chicken, and desserts.Chilli Crab is delicious but not the best we have tasted. Crab is of decent size and soaking the buns with crab gravy is yummy. Rest of the food is good too, again not great.Service.------Servers are attentive and service is good. Price----I did not pick up the Bill, so no idea but since this place is touristy then expect tourist pricing.Overall, give this a try but if you want better food but no riverside environment, see my other review

A colleague from our office took me and the colleague I was traveling with here for an early dinner. The place was very clean and super busy but it was a Sunday night so no surprises there. Staff was attentive if rushed but I wouldn't expect them to be chatty in a place like this. The food was very good. We had the chili crab which was yummy but very messy. The guy I was sitting next to in the plane said that I had to get the black pepper crab. Alas, we didn't and I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed given how good the chili crab was. We also had cereal shrimp which was surprisingly delicious. Fried rice and some Chinese vegetables rounded up the meal with tea being served as well. I'd recommend this place but I don't think I would go back a second time. A lot of amazing places to eat in Singapore so why limit yourself?
5
We had team dinner in this restaurant we had an fantastic evening Service was excelent very kindly people good food nice drinks
4
Very good food. We order chile crab for 2 people. The size for crab was small. We should order midium size.
3
Food and landscape is good.
But service is not good(very noise and unsettled)
and That store gives poor service.
4
Even on a weeknight, the Jumbo restaurants in the Clarke Quay area (there are 2) are busy so please book online or via the phone. Or, if you are already in the area, grab a ticket before going to the bar for a couple of pre dinner drinks.This is now my go-to place to take overseas visitors. Seating outside is great in the evening (provided it doesn't rain). The service is as you'd expect... ok up until the point you order otherwise hard to get their attention unless you're getting another beer.The food this time has been the best out of the 4 or 5 times I've been here. The crab was $70 today, around 800 grams and the spiciness was perfect. The sauce was thick and it came out hot. The buns didn't though. We also had seafood soup and a vegie dish which were good. Not sure why they insist but a jug of beer equals 4 mugs... we preferred to order by the mug as it would keep the beer colder but the waitress then came back and said to us we should have ordered a jug... if I am the one paying, not sure how that matters?! Not a huge difference money wise anyway but I guess she was trying to point it out to us so there you go...
5
You need to do reservation at least a day before as the place is very popular especially among the locals and tourists as well. A bit pricey but was served with very good quality seafood and veggies. Tried the chilli crab and drunken prawns and was very tasty and of good quality. Service was ok though some servers can not speak English well
4
Great dinner at Jumbo Riverside in a group of 5, we arrived w/o reservation but received a table after a call from Jumbo waiting in a bar nearby - good service. Nice table and quick & friendly service in a relaxed and easy atmosphere. All dished were exquisite, in particular the crabs and the roasted dry squid (mmmh).Prices are ok.We will be back 
5
Jumbo is a well known seafood restaurant with several branches, their crab is great and the quality and service consistently very good. Local Singaporeans will tell you it's a tourist and expat trap, but it's not a bad place to be trapped. And prices are not cheap, it's seafood after all, but reasonable compared to what you would pay for crab and simpler places. So I'd say it is definitely worth it and you will never be disappointed, as long as you've booked a table. The black pepper crab is better than the chilli in my opinion
5
Ate dinner at Jumbo Seafood Riverside Restaurant with my wife on a recent trip to Singapore. Unfortunately we didn't have a booking so had to leave our name at reception - essentially they take your mobile number (can be an international number) and text you when a table is ready. You can elect to be on a 'shared table' for the 'express' line but this literally means you share a 8 person circular table with 6 strangers, which is a little awkward. The chilli grab was around 76SD (based on weight) which is about twice the cost of a hawker centre but the quality was great. Make sure you get plenty of bread roles to soak up the sauce. We particularly enjoyed the pumpkin prawns and can recommend this as well. Service was OK, but not particularly attentive. Overall 2 entree's, a chill grab main and a couple of drinks totaled around 170 which wasn't the cheapest but we certainly enjoyed our meals and would recommend it to others
4
The food is amazing, the atmosphere bustling, but the service incredibly rude. This is an iconic restaurant in Singapore in an amazing riverside setting. We were made aware that the table was hours for a limited time, which we accepted, but we felt hustled from the minute we sat down. The lady that served us was surly and did not make us feel in the least bit welcome. This restaurant lives by its reputation for serving incredible seafood and we were not disappointed. The lobster was incredible. However, they should also pay attention to the level of service that they provide. Next time we are in Singapore, we will definitely look elsewhere for a seafood meal. This was the last night of an otherwise amazing holiday, but we felt very let down
4
I will eat here everytime I come with my family as we love their yummie chilli crabs , and all other seafood menus !If you come to singapore you should try it too! Excellent service and nice view along the river.Good value for money ! Very fresh and delicious 
4
We came for the chilli crab and fried bread. Although the fried bread were smaller that before it was still delicious and so was the crab. Restaurant was packed and highly recommend booking beforehand. Even though i'd prebooked, we had an outside table.
5
It was very convenient to reserve via web site.
I had seat riverside and hading chilly crab with nice view
4
Good choice of singapore crab dishes with air conditioning. Service is good. Famous for tourists. Best book before go.
5
The foods are great and mostly the chilli crab is fantastic and for sure will come back again. Love the venue just near the center of Clarke 😊
5
Everything was perfect for food, values, service, and atmosphere! If I visit Singapore again, I would like to visit once again.
5
My family is love to dining in this restaurant.
The seafood is fresh & very delicious. Recommended!!.
Will visit again
5
Fantastic chilli crab served in a very popular and busy restaurant. You are allocated a one and half hour time slot but generally they don't enforce this.The crab is delicious with a good amount of sauce and of course you have great fun getting so messy eating it with your fingers!! Highly recommende
4
We always come here for the chilli crab. As usual, we were not disappointed by the taste of food here. Though comparing this from previous visits before, the service was a bit of a letdown considering the price they charge. We were not given bibs, we need to ask for it. We asked for extra plates and crab cracker but we have not finished talking yet, the server quickly get the extra plates and missed out the crab crackers. But overall, still a good experience because of the food
5
Please be warned - if you are worried about diet, this is not the place for you. I assure you that you will over eat as Sea bass and chilly Crab are finger licking good. Being a sea side restaurant - you end up spending entire evening there
3
Food is served at very fast speed, very efficient, however it might be abit rush if you want to enjoy talking to your friends and the scene around you! You only allow to eat for around 1 hour 15 min, which is indeed very rush 
4
The chilli crab is so tasty & yummy, everytime we eat at Jumbo, we never fail to order chilli crab & fried mantou.
5
Great seafood place to eat. Has outside and inside dining.. Food is great. My husband just loved the pepper and chili crabs both, Had to look up online to see if Houston had a place to eat Pepper Crab.
5
This is a must do gastronomical experience when in Singapore. Make sure you don't order too much as the crabs are huge. Basically a single crab is enough for 3 people or so. The best way to do it (and to keep costs down) is to order the black pepper crab which is fleshy and gorgeously seasoned while getting the Singapore chilli crab gravy instead of the actual chilli crab! (as that's the best part about the chillie crab)don't forget to.get a few portions of fried buns to dip in to the sauce. Divine
4
You wouldn't wanna miss out Jumbo Chilli Crab. Signature dish and a must if you in Jumbo. Crab is huge and fresh, of course it is very yummy. Love to eat with the fried bun, perfect combo. Their abalone, prawn is also very fresh. It can be cooked based on own preference. A down side, price is consider higher vs the food portion.
3
Best known for its Chilli crab, I must say that it's nice, but the overall quality in terms of taste has declined alongside with other dishes. The restaurant is always v busy and we were seated on the 2nd floor with great ambience.However most of the dishes were served a bit cold. Disappointing Get Chilli crab elsewhere
5
Heard about jumbo seafood through a friend and was told to get the chilli crab and it did not disappoint. The crab was fresh and juicy and he chilli sauce was perfect not over powering and the deep fried bread roles to dip into the chilli sauce were amazing!
5
Besides the wonderful seafood, this has to be one of the most intimate and romantic locations in Singapore. Living in California, crabs in the kg class are generally considered something special. Here, they are considered Juveniles. Expect the menu to include bruisers in the 2+ kg class, and these folks know how to cook them to bring out the best. Naturally they will be EXPENSIVE, but rationalize it as an unforgettable once in a lifetime opportunity. It will definitely be that
5
Great chili crab....!!!Not cheap but so, so worth it....we only ordered crab and rice...!I can't complain about the customer service....there wasn't any...!!!Singapore is playing its cards merely on numbers through their doors...I for one will not be back any time soon...I like to be looked after when parting with my cash....Singapore couldn't be bothered in looking after their guests sadly....!!!But back to the crab....be prepared to get your hands dirty...it really is delicious....If there for lunch, be prepared yo be almost thrown out at 3om on the dot as the restaurant closes at 3....!!

My husband and I were looking for the Singaporean seafood experience and our hotel concierge recommended Jumbo Seafood (Riverside Point). We had a booking for late in the evening but went early on the off-chance that we might get a walk-in. We were lucky. The place was pumping! All looked great. The chilli crab was delicious (my husband's meal), but my main - steamed sea bass - arrived 15 minutes later. The staff had to be reminded to bring us the rice we ordered. We had also ordered dessert, but the waitress tried to move us on before they'd even served the dessert! So, although the food - when it arrived - was fresh and tasty, the service was not commensurate with the bill. Too much like a conveyor belt. It spoilt the overall impression considerably
3
The Chilli Crab at Jumbo was delicious, loved it - however that was about it though.Service at the restaurant once you get a table is pretty poor from non smiling waitresses who are more interested in turning the tables over as soon as they can. We were also packed in like sardines in the inside restaurant - put in as many as you can........plus there was chairs stacked way high in the middle of the restaurant which looked very unprofessional & sloppy. If you can get a table outside you are much better off I believe.I also suggest you make a booking as it's a busy place. If you don't have a booking you can go there as we did and put you mobile number down and they will call you when a table is free. If you are happy to share a table then it will be faster. Overall the food was good but the rest was very poor
5
it was expensive but has great view, delicious and fresh foods. I recommend chili crab and cereal prawns.
4
Wonderful Mie Goreng - flavorful and spicy fried noodle dish common in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore. Served quickly and effectively by the staff. Standard prices for Singapore (includes the location of course). Absolutely recommended!
3
The place is obviously popular with tourists. We went to this restaurant the first night we arrived Singapore, being recommended by a local. But it was a disappointment. Food quality was average. Price was expensive, taking into consideration the environment and service.
4
If you are a crab lover, this is the place to go in Singapore. It offers both Chili and Black Pepper Crab, but Black Pepper is the better. Other menu are OK but not Wow.
Location is very convenient, service is very efficient.
5
This was recommended to us by our Hotel. We did not have a booking but managed to get a table straight away. We ordered shark fin soup and chilli crab and tiger beer. The soup was great and the chilli crab was amazing. This was our first chill crab and we loved it. The service was busy but worked well. Loved sitting outside on the river. This will always be on my must do list when in Singapore. Would love to see this restaurant open in Sydney
5
This seafood restaurant is great. Good variety of individual items and set courses for 2 or 4 people. The chili crab is to die for. The locals we asked said this place had the best chili crab in Singapore! It's well worth a visit while you are here. Just know they close their lunch service down around 2 to prep for dinner. I'd definitely go back!
1
I didn't know that coach roaches can fly and I just saw one here earlier! I totally freaked out and jumped out of my chair (plus scream!!!) when it flew and landed on my table. It took off and landed on my friend's shirt and the service staff pretended nothing happened!!! They didn't care that a coach roach flew on the table!
5
Our group included my sister, 11 year old daughter and I, and there was something for everyone. While we didn't feel confident in tackling the popular Chilli Crab, the couple on the next table ordered it and it looked and smelled spectacular. We shared scallops, chicken & prawns, and it was all delicious
4
My wife and I visited this restaurant and ordered the chilli crab and the peeled cereal prawns what a delicious meal the crab was just beautiful and the sauce was to kill for, just a tip get a side order of the buns to soak up the sauce. The cereal prawns were cooked perfectly and that cereal crust wow it was is a knock out. The only downer is the price so be prepared they charge you for the peanuts and tea they are NOT complimentary that was the only negative if ya call paying for those small items negative in total with 2 tiger beers and taxes it was $170, overall a great experience if ya in Singapore.Mark and Anne Australia
4
My partner and I ordered the chilli crab and a seafood rice. Both were delicious! The service was fine and we didn't have to wait too long for our food. The only negative I can think of was the spacing of the tables. We were very close to our neighbours, which irked me a little bit. Particularly as they were all silent playing on their phones, so it generated an awkward atmosphere (for me, everyone else was so buried in their phones that I doubt they even noticed). Despite that, we still had a great time
5
The food quality, taste and overall ambiance is par excellence.
Must go for all seafood lovers its pure haven. Service and staff are very warm and hospitable.
2
Slowly, kindness, normal foods. If I visit to Singapore again I never go to Jumbo seaside point. It's true.
1
waitress made me an order 2 chili crabs for 2 people. and we were left almost our meals. wasted my money. so terrible.
4
I've tried chili crab, black pepper crab and shrimp with cereal all they taste were so delicious. Especially the shrimp with cereal was really special if you are planning to eat you must try it👍👍👍
5
There is no doubt that you will get great chilli crab throughout Singapore and the locals will always let you know their version of the best - but when you are visiting as a tourist, why not visit the iconic Jumbo Seafood. There are a few Jumbo's around Singapore - we suggest heading to the big one in Clarke Quay. As a minimum try the traditional chilli crab and maybe if you go as a couple or group make sure one of you has the very tasty salt & pepper crab too. It is a fun experience with the bibs and constant support of attentive waiters. Oh and the beers seem to taste even better there!
5
Simply try everything here, you won't be disappointed. Very busy with locals and tourists alike. The service is fast and efficient, Jasmine tea on arrival. Chili crab is delicious, fragrant and flavoursome. For me, the best dish is the king prawns in pumpkin puree... There is nothing better.
4
Whilst in Singapore 1 of the things on the must do list was to have Chilli Crab.Asked our 1 of our hotel staff where to get good chilli crab and he suggested Jumbo Seafood, 5 minute walk.Place was packed, and it was a Tuesday night. Got a shared table for the 2 of us at 6:30p.m. with the proviso we were out by 8:00p.m., they obviously do 2 sittings.We had the set menu which included a lychee fruit drink, lobster & dragon fruit salad (not much lobster, plenty of fruit), prawns in cereal (way too much cereal), fried rice, chilli crab and a dessert. A cost of SGD$168/person + gst +service charge. With a bottle of wine the total bill was SGD$392.00 for the two of us.In the room where we were seated they have TV screens on the wall showing how the dishes are prepared. This is actually an infomercial as they have a branded range of sauce mixes you can buy for some of their menu items, including the chilli crab.The chilli crab was the best we have ever had, the rest of the set menu was not up to the same standard.Service was rushed with food being brought out too close together, probably our fault because we hadn't booked and just walked in.Would recommend this restaurant purely for the chilli crab. Make sure you book and don't go the set menu. The chilli crab, with some rice or noodles is plenty for 2 people. When ordering the chilli crab a la carte I was advised to get the price when ordering to ensure you aren't served the biggest crabs in the house
5
Booked a dinning for 7 Adult and 1 Kid on Level 2 with River view.Was call up to inform that a minimum spend is required, staff assisted in making a counter offer for a River view reservation.On the actual day we got a River View table and spend less than the minimum required spending amount
5
This is a definately a must try for any tourist in Singapore. You must try their signature dish: Chilli crab, and it cost you 80 SGD for a dish for 2 people with 900 gam crab. You should order additional bao, and its great combination with the sause. Make sure you book your table before going in the weekend, otherwise you will wait for about 20-30 minutes for your table
4
Went to the branch that close to Clark Quay on a Friday evening. The place was bustling with customers and we had waited for 45 min for our table. We were seated by the river which was nice. The service was a bit slow and we were pretty hungry by the time the starter arrived. We had scallops, king prawns and the seafood fried rice but a lot of tables were having the chilli crabs. We were going to have chilli crab next evening at another place so we didn't want the same thing again. The food was good but the portion wasn't very big in Singaporean standard and the price weren't cheap either. However the view and the atmosphere made up for the price we pai
5
It's worth the wait, make reservation. The food is authentic for a chain. Quick delivery of your appetizers and orders once you get a table.
5
Food is very good, as always. The reservation that I booked online is at 10pm but we were able to sit early. We make it a point to dine here whenever we're in Singapore.
5
The food and service were excellent! My only complaint was that the tables might be a little small (table of 4) to accommodate all our dishes.
4
The Chili crab are superb and the crab size are big. The service was good and food are delicious and it's one of the famous seafood restaurant in town.
5
You would be lucky to get a table at Jumbo and the wait is also worth it and do try their crabs..its soft and succukent and all the dishes are mind blowing.
3
We tried 2 kinds of crab, black pepper and spice salt. Both are delicious. Herbal prawns was not bad. We also order baby squid, crispy chicken and fried rice were just Ok.
4
We had an 8 pm reservation but our requested table for inside with A/C was not available for 20 minutes. The food was solid and well presented. However, I thought the chili crab was not as meaty as those served at Long Beach Seafood. Tasty, but just not knock my socks off fantastic
3
ive always loved jumbo ...the way they do their chiili crab is actually unparalleled. However their staff is extremely rude if they get to know if u are an India. I wish a place that is listed in the stock exchange and serving such amazing food can raise their service standards. Heres hoping to a better experince when i travel nex
4
On a short stay in Singapore we meet up with an old friend, he said we had to try chilli crab and that Jumbos was the restaurant to go to. We had a long wait for a table as they were very busy but once seated we had no need to rush. Chilli crab maybe tasty but it's hard work for not a lot of meat and very messy, hence bibs are supplied! Liked the cereal prawns, and fried noodles. Three people eating with wine and beer 179.50$ (Â£102.85) the setting of the restaurant is very pleasant, by the river, the area is busy. Service was fine. Seemed very popular with locals.
1
This restaurant is very unfriendly. The restaurant has a time limit of 1 hour and 30 minutes to eat. I did not know it before going to the restaurant. The employee briefly said 'finish 00:00' at the entrance. I asked the employee what it meant. However, the employee repeatedly said 'finish 00:00'. We ordered chili crab and fried rice. Food was served one hour after ordering. No one apologized, only to keep waiting. The food was delicious. But I do not want to visit again
4
Great atmosphere and great food. Service was good too, staff were helpful. I enjoyed the chili crab, a must try when you visit
5
We went there as a large group of 12. Service was great. The rest of the group were rapt with the chilli crab (I can take it or leave it - seems a lot of hard work to eat it).
2
If you guys like commerise Seafood, Jumbo is the place for you. Very basic seafood taste and more suitable for expatriate tastbuds rather than people who really seek for mouth watering food.
4
Wonderful meal. Had chilli mud crab with steamed rice. To compliment it a good bottle of Australian white. So busy, however, it did not impact on the service. Only sorry can't go back tomorrow night. Treat yourself!
5
Treat yourself to a memorable night and enjoy their amazing Singapore crab. A few extra dollars spent soon forgotten with some lasting memories.
2
Overrated food...nothing special. Ordered chili crab+ fried buns and steam buns ..averageSeafood fried rice average A veggie dish with preserve egg dish, come out watery...they must cooked before hand not fresh.Service was bad, We booked at 1:00 pm so it wasn't that busy. We was under impression that they don't care if we eat at their restaurant or not. Never again
5
It is our tradition when in Singapore to partake of Chilli Mud Crab at Jumbos. The crabs are always delicious but I must say the prices have gone sky high. We normally have a mud crab each but this time we shared one. Just as well, cost $144.00 . We have at times taken our own wine which we did this time but when they wanted $30 corkage we decided a couple of beers would do. The restaurant is always busy so you need to book prior to going. Staff reasonably friendly but are very bus
4
We felt that we had to try the local speciality, and Jumbos did not disappoint. The setting by the quayside is great, the service is charming, and the crab was delicious. We paid 'market price' which worked out at 150 Sing $ for two with seafood fried rice and a couple of beers. Good value I thought for a delightful local treat.
3
We went here for the Singapore Chilli Crab and mantou buns. Good crab and a nice setting, but very busy and the staff were not overly friendly. Like so many places, it suffers from its popularity and constantly being described as one of the best places for crab. To be honest, I have tasted better at the hawker centres, but it was still good and worth a visit if you are unsure of where else to go
5
Good taste, I visited Jumbo Seafood Riverside for two times. For the first time not took long time for the queue but for my second it took very very long queue. If you would like to have dinner, you should better go there before 6 pm. You need to reserve for the queue, even you walk in, you need to reserve anyway. So if you have chance to visit Singapore, should come to Jumbo Seafood also. The signature dish is Chili Crab.So delicious
5
Chilli crab and black pepper crab is good. The taste is delicious. We can order stream or fried bun to eat together with crab. However , the price is quit high. 1 chilli crab is 70$ and 1 black pepper crab is 80$
4
Service was very good...and the food quality was fresh and excellent..especially their chilli crab...
4
Food is Very good. But service is poor.
The employees should be more friendly.
The chili crab was really delicious.
5
Surely will.come back again , fast responsed, friendly staff, super good food esp their chilli crabs
5
have been to this restaurant 5 years ago with my local colleagues during a business trip, and took my family here again while been in Singapore for vacation.Delicious food and staff is doing their best to manage huge number of visitors. If you have not reserved the table in advance, be prepared to wait 1-2 hours in an electronic queue
2
This was a hard one for me to rate as I was so excited to go here but ended up very disappointed by the staff and service. I would definitely give the food a 10 out of 10. The chilli crab was amazing and so was the Mee Goreng. When we arrived we did not have a booking so just went in line to wait for a table. We only waited around 30 mins then were seated. That's where the service stopped. We were offered hot tea and some nuts on the table to start (little did we know they would later charge us for these). We had to get a waiters attention to order, then ask for extra crab crackers as we ordered 2 crabs, then ask for the bibs. The food came out very slow and one at a time. They forgot the rice so again we had to get a waiters attention to re-order the rice. Not once were we asked if the food was ok or if we would like more drinks or offered any water. My sister and I had a bottle of wine that we had to top up our glasses ourselves. Now I don't expect to be waited on constantly but when your paying over $100 per person I do expect a higher level of service. Once we finished our meals again we had to ask for the bill. Would I go back.... As amazing as the food was probably not due to the staff and service.
5
As a crab lover, I will have to say that Jumbo fulfills my appetite wholeheartedly. This restaurant offers you selective delicacy including the most popular chilli crab in a pan. It is not too spicy nor to salty. The crab is cooked just right for you to taste both the crab meat and the sauce. Make sure you do early booking as this place will be more than fully booked (long waiting list even) during dinner time. Each table is only given 90 minutes for dining from start to finish
4
Having eaten crab prepared many ways over the years, we had to try one of Singapore's specialties. Our local friends took us to Jumbos, who specializes in seafood and Chili Crab. In preparation, we went to their web site which had videos on the proper way to eat one. Imagine whole Crabs in a pot of specially prepared chili sauce and the mess you make because you must eat it with your hands. After multiple napkins, finger bowls and handy wipes; one can declare success! A fun interesting dinner that was rather tasty. In addition to the crab, try their specially prepared baby squid as an appetizer

We went to have the chilly crab and the whole meal was great. Excellent food and choice if you like seafood of course. If not, there is not so much for you. Staff were a little slow at times to take the orders but got there in the end. Our waitress had a delightful 'bossy' demeanour and she was hilarious. Made the trip an experience. Worth going to.
1
I must admit we normally do ' fine dining' , this was going to be a casual night with good seafood and atmosphere. From start to end it was terrible. Food, ambience, service, everything. It was a joke! My prawns were not cooked, wait staff didn't care. My partners fish was literally swimming in its sauce, cleaners rattled around collecting dishes and children were allowed to run around the place. The quality of the food and service was the worst I have experienced.Do NOT go there
4
The crab was very good, although not cheap. We were there before the restaurant opened for dinner. The service was more oriented toward handling busy crowds, so not a place for romantic dinners.
4
We had great tasty seafood. Their service has always been excellent! Always a best choice to bring overseas guest around to enjoy authentic local food.
2
Didn't like this place a lot.
The wine was perhaps the only good thing. Service was very slow and the food food wasn't up to standard.
4
Every single time i have been in Singapore i have made a trip to Jumbo. I LOVE the food especially the chilli crab and buns. I also love the view of the waters and general ambience and excitement. I will be back again for sure!
3
Good place with a big variety of seafood cooked with singaporean touch. Not my favourite restaurant, if u can choose Jumbo East Coast to enjoy the sea view
2
When ask the waiter to refill tea and give us the gloves for the crab, they are very rude in reply to us. No doubt is busy however each customer deserves to be treated properly instead of the rude response.
4
Great choice of foods here but always good to pick the famous recommendation set from the restaurant,
5
The queuing system is great - you register and then get a call when your table is ready, so I was able to go to a bar for a quick drink before dinner. I had an open air table (under an umbrella) overlooking the river. The chilli crab was excellent. I also had scallops with XO sauce and wok-fried prawns to start, which was excessive
3
Went here as Jumbo Riverwalk was too crowded and had a long wait. The service here is not as good as the other Jumbo, however once seated the food did not take long to come out. Although the food lacked some flavour it was alright and the chilli crab was good
4
Okay, not sure why the Riverside outlet gets a bad rap compared to the Riverwalk outlet just a few hundred metres away.The line is shorter and there view is just as good. We actually were going to go to the Riverwalk outlet (based on reviews online) but it was over 90 minutes wait on a Saturday evening without reservations so we decided to try our luck at the Riverside one. And wholla, was called back for a table within minutes eventhough it also said up to 60 minute wait.The chilli crab was of Jumbo standard (even better than the last time I had it at the East Coast outlet). The crabs aren't flavoursome but it's all about the sauce... and the buns. Also got the cereal prawns which were average (have had better at the Dempsey outlet) and the spinch with century egg... yum! Initially, we wanted to get the beancurd with spinach and mushroom but they had sold out which was disappointing.Lots of patrons here and they were quick to move the tables back outside after the rain. Service is average
5
Best place to enjoy the crab in Singapore. Best try the black pepper one. Location is perfect on Clarke. Jasmine tea served is also very nice.
3
Very busy restaurant, food is good, but service was below average. Our group of 5 enjoyed the chilli and pepper crab, then had to wait for quite a while to get the bill
3
Ok food with decent flavour, menu prices are a little expensive and misleading, as the prices on the menu are NOT inclusive of the gst or the service charge! So be aware to add at least 20% to your bills total!
3
My opinion,
Place nice, view good riverside point, touristic
Chilli crab, good but not special
Black pepper crab, worst than chilli
Fried rice for me, was bad
Price high, we can find chilli crab much better
No come again
4
tasty fresh food delivered in a timely manner, really enjoyed the sweet and sour prawns. service was distant ,un engaging and inert but thats pretty normal for Jmbo so you need to manage your expectations
5
No trip to Singapore is complete without stopping by Jumbo to indulge in chili crabs and fried mantou! The queue is totally worth it although I suggest you make a reservation.
4
I can safely say, the food is consistently good especially the crabs ANDDDD, the Mee Goreng, the latter is stupendously yummy - that is, if you like the wet version. Amidst all the busyness, I must also say the service is excellent considering how frantic the pace is. But be forewarned, avoid the salted egg prawns with a ten-foot pole. It's soggy and the salted egg was missing. 70 cents for a fried mantou I find is rather steep taking into consideration that one would need at least 3 pieces to satisfy

We have been coming to Jumbo's, every time we visit Singapore, which has been many years, and to be honest, the last couple of times have been a bit hit and miss, but we have prevailed and have continued to come back. However, this visit, perhaps has sealed it for us. We always book ahead to avoid the queues, but what struck me the most this time was the total lack of respect for me as a patron. From the moment I fronted up with my booking slip (not a smile or welcome) to ordering a Singapore Sling; only to be told - not available (but it was 6 months ago!) having to ask twice for the beer my husband ordered, to finally the the crab tasting just OK. It seems that the success of Jumbo's has lead to the total lack of friendliness, and what I believe patrons deserve as part of the service (given the cost) which is a real shame, as it is one of the landmarks of Singapore. So my next trip I will be seeking out a more pleasant experience in another restaurant (which I have experienced at other Singaporean restaurants during my stays) whilst eating the famous 'Singapore Chilli Crab"
1
A restaurant of this repute and charging these prices really needs to have all basic hospitality aspects covered. Our experience included rude wait staff, treating customers with contempt. At least four menu items we attempted to order had 'run out'. I find this totally unacceptable in a restaurant that requires advance booking and is fully booked every night of the week! Toilets were a disgrace. Given one star for the quality of the food (that we were eventually able to determine was available) was very good. This review references the Clarke Quay restaurant. Will not recommend and will not go again.
4
We opted to dine at the riverside location since it was an easy walk from our hotel. Also opted for lunch thinking less queue and/or reservation. Please note, when the hours states 11-3 for lunch, this doesn't mean the restaurant accepts orders at 3pm. The last order is taken at 2:15 so do take this into account when planning lunch. We arrived at 2pm and after chatter amongst the staff whether they could accommodate us due to the late hour, was quickly seated. The service was rushed but understandable. As we were dining, the phone was ringing off the hook for dinner reservations! Apparently a must if you choose to enjoy chili crab for dinner. We ordered the chili crab and the pepper crab so we could choose for ourselves which one we would prefer. The pepper crab arrived first which we devoured. Loved the heat of the black pepper. The chili crab came next and although delicious, my husband and I agreed we loved the pepper crab more! We were told by our Singaporean friends Jumbo is a safe place due to their consistently to try our first chili crab. Having done that, I think we will try the chili crab at Long Beach's chili crab next time we are in Singapore since they offer a spicy version
5
We ordered a plate of these delicious crabs for the 4 of us and did not quite finish . It is not an inexpensive place, costing about $50 each including a few beers, but it was well worth it.
2
We understood the food would be We were told the food would be good. It was. If indifferent service is acceptable to you, then a good night can be expected.
3
Only one good thing in this place!!
The chili crab 🦀
The waiter doesn't know what is gluten free and doesn't speak English really well!!
Good
Location
5
it was good delicious! and service was good too.also river view was good i hope to visit again!!!!!!
5
This is a must stop for our family every time we are in Singapore.. Our favorite dish is the Chilli Crabs and the second option would be pepper crabs. We have also visited most of the Jumbo Seafood restaurants in Singapore and they are consistently good.

Be prepared to shell (ha!) out a lot of money for the meal here, but it’s totally worth it. Considered by most people I’ve talked to as one of the top two or three crab restaurants in SG (which is world famous for crab) and I understand why. The crabs are huge. We had one chili crab and one pepper crab for five people. Soooo good. also some fried noodles, spinach with garlic, prawns with some kind of sweet, dry crust on them (wish I could remember the name) and of course, buns to soak up the sauces. Plenty of pitchers of cold Tiger beer to round out the meal. Reservations are highly recommended as it is crowded every night. On the border of Clarke Quay and Boat Quay, with both indoor and outdoor seating. Service is efficient, lots of people refilling glasses, getting more beer. Not overly friendly but that’s not really an issue, you’ll be too busy chowing down to care. Highly recommende
1
The service is extremely bad. The waiters do not pay attention while we order as they look elsewhere and are in a hurry to just walk away before you finish your order. The impression I and my friends had was that the waiters think it is beneath their dignity to be waiters and do not seem to respect their jobs.The service here can make a very good example of how to have a bad service in a restaurant. The food like in any other Singapore hyped-up restaurants is below average and overpriced. Suggest you skip this place

My wife and I enjoyed a delightful dinner at Jumbo dining outside on the bank of Singapore River by Clarke Quay whilst overnighting en route to New Zealand. This restaurant is famous for its chilli crab and it didn't disappoint. It's supposed to be a sharing dish for up to four people but I managed to get through most of one unaided whilst my wife enjoyed a large plate of prawns. This was the most expensive meal of our trip, but the cost was less than half of what I've been quoted for chilli mud crab in Australia. If in Singapore with a wish to try crab then this is the place
3
The buzz and atmosphere of pavement dining around Riverside Quay is great, and space is a premium. Every restaurant therefore is full and at busy times they will turn a table 4 times a night so dont expect to take your time!Jumbo have many restaurants all over Singapore and their reputation of Chilli Crab meant I was expecting something special. Alas the reality was OK but felt like a conveyor belt.Presented with Set Menu A or B, this means you're thrown your food with the cursory singapore sling. You get it all at the same time and it keeps coming until your time slot has been met. Appetiser with the Main Crab, Dessert with the Prawns and Rice.Go for the experience. Unfortunately felt like the food was McCrab
3
A once off touristy experience. The service was average but we enjoyed the meal overall. The cereal prawns were too sweet for our taste but the chilli dipping sauce was tasty. Seafood fried rice was also yummy when mixed with the crab sauce in the big pot. We requested a riverside table when we made the reservation but were seated inside right next to the kitchen. A bit cheeky to charge for the nuts and tea that we didn't even ask for. An expensive meal but a true Singapore experience.
4
The chilli crab is just amazing but too expensive. The view to the clark quay is also a positive point for this hotel
4
Food came fast which is good because you only have 1 hour to eat. Ambience was nice because it was facing the river and there was a live band playing good music because of a festival which was on at the time.
5
Worth it!
must visit in singapore!
Chilicrap is very nice and our family enjoyed the meal! Thanks !!!
5
The chilly crab is very delicious, the food is so freshly. Service is very good but the table is too close to the other table.
4
Generally the food, service was very good. It was just a little expensive, especially the pepper crab.
5
The price was a bit expensive, but overall it was a very satisfying restaurant. I am a Korean, and my taste, which is a Korean, was well spiced. It is a famous place so I recommend you to visit it once in a while.
1
Hey, Nobody told us we had to pay for our meal at the tableAfter we'd done our meal, we left our table in order to pay our check. And when we came back to the table, servers made us feel very awkward and embarrassed! Other than that we stood there for over 5 minutes to receive the change. For this reason, I will never visit your restaurant again.One last thing guys, you really really must teach manners to the staff
5
Having been to Singapore a number of times, we wanted to try Singapore Chili Crab, and our research took us to Jumbo.We thoroughly enjoyed the meal - it was an experience. The crab was tasty and not too spicy/hot. The side dishes complimented the crab.It was the most expensive meal we had in Singapore, but for less than $170 AUD, it was memorable
3
Chilli crab was delicious, the source went very well when dipping with deep fried buns. A bit expensive, SGD80/kg.The live prawns with cereal was disappointing, the prawns were not fresh, the meet was loose. Don't order prawns if you are planning to go there.The location is good, just next to Clarke Quay, with beautiful river view. After the dinner, can grab a ice cream sandwich for dessert from the kiosk just outside the restaurant
4
We came here at short notice based on a recommendation of a friend. It is a very hectic, busy and bustling restaurant. The three of us were asked to share a table with a family from the UK, which worked okay.The service was good if not overly friendly. They were quick to take orders, to bring the food, and to top up drinks. They brought napkins and bibs for each of us.The food was generally okay. Not sure I would go out of my way for it but it was generally tasty. The chili crab was probably the best dish we had.Overall it was a bit expensive for the quality of the food and experience but nonetheless it is worth a visit if you are keen on eating some fresh local seafood
4
Always bring my friend for the chili crab and the feedbacks from my friends are amazing. They all like the favor.
5
crab was fresh and it's taste amazing this was a great experience and i would like to introduce to all my friends
5
Our friends took us there as they know we like seafood.They ordered the group dinner and each dish was good or very good. I especially liked the crab. Didn't pay wondered how expensive it was.
5
Service of the manager Tom was excellent! Butter crab was not available in this outlet. In order not to disappoint my daughter's birthday wish, he made special effort to obtain the crabs and cooked it in the way that she likes it. Thanks so much for taking the extra step
5
I had excellent meals with my family. We was glad to spend that time. The food, atmosphere, service, and scene at JUMBO SEAFOOD was all good, so I wanna recommend these my friends happily. If you go there, I recommend late time to eat all comfortably because 75min was difficult a little for me to eat all. But it was more wonderful than the matter. Thank you for such a great time

There are multiple locations of this restaurant. We went to the one at Riverside Point, which has a beautiful view over the Singapore river. We were visiting from Houston and our colleagues made reservations for a team dinner so they could treat us to a classic Singapore dinner of Chili Crabs and Black Pepper Crabs. It was delicious but messy, but fortunately they give you bibs, gloves, water to rinse your fingers, and tools to crack / get the crab out. Since we did not pay, I'm not sure how much the Crab cost -- but it said "market price". We also ordered the deep fried mini buns that you dip into the crab "gravy", prawns coated in cereal, asparagus with garlic, and seafood fried rice. All were very good
5
Great service provided when we try to order something different from the set menu provided. Recommendation are given by the service crew and he also gave constructive opinion when we order foods that are too similar or too much for us. Request are promptly attended to as well. Overall great experience
4
We went there for dinner, 1 kg of mud crab was SGD88You cannot choose the size of your crab. They will give you 1,2 kgWe ordered 1 portion of chili crab + 4 mini buns + 2 bottle water and it cost us around SGD 124The crab is big and it taste goodAsk the waiter for gloves and apron The queue system is a little bit confusingThe have 2 line : 1 for walk in guests, 1 for reserved guestsIf you dont make any reservation before,:1. enter the walk in guest line2. You will fine tablet phone3. you will be asked how many persons and would you share table4. enter your mobile phone number (make sure it's on and able to receive call)You will received SMS about your queue numberyou can check current number on TVThey will call you when it's your turnThey will offer you peanuts and tea. It's not complimentaryif you refuse, they will bring it bac

We saw Jumbo seafood while walking around Clarke Quay around 10 pm on a Thursday night (it's across the bridge on the Riverside area) and what stood out was the number of people dining here so we thought we'd give it a try and it was a wise decision.We had the deep fried sea bass, prawns topped with cheese and a venison, which was the stand-out dish of the night. The food was great, the ambience along Singapore river was even better. Highly recommend this for a late-night meal with friends. It gets very crowded however so you may have a hard time getting a table without a reservation if you go earlier in the evening
5
Had a wonderful chilli crab at this very busy restaurant. We went on the advice of someone from Singapore and we were not disappointed. They have a great reservation system and we were messaged as soon as our table was ready, plus we could see how many were waiting in front of us. Staff are very helpful in advising how much food to order. We will be bac

It's delicious food & special experience, have a fine view.
Really nice day =)
I'll come back to you. Thank-you!!!!
4
We were absolutely satisfied with dishes. However there were more expensive than I expected.
Location was great.
5
Delicious
All sea food are fresh and nice, but waiters are little too busy to take care of all customers
5
The chilli crabs and Pepper crabs were amazing and extremely delicious. Service was excellent and the cod fish was too good!
5
Great chilly crab, soup, and Tofu; service friendly, nice view along the river. Will come back again.
4
The soft crab was to die for- though expensive and messey. drinks very expensive but overall the experiance was great
5
Re-union dinner of three families. The food is good, very fresh, of course, the price is also very high.
5
I was here last May and my brother and sister-in-law booked this place for a table of 13 ppl and DAM!!! It's the best mud crab I have ever had. The sauce was beautiful and it came with a sweet mini bun and that was lovely too. I would recommend anyone who visit Singapore to go to Jumbo for the chilli mud crab. Just remember to book a couple of days before you go there else you might have to wait around for at least 1-2hrs for your time
4
This is not a posh restaurant, service is efficient. We went on a Thursday night without a reservation and had to only wait 20 minutes. Singapore Chilli Crab is Singapore's signature dish and it didn't disappoint. It is a sweet chilli favour best enjoyed when every last morsel is either sucked crushed and chewed. Make sure you get that large napkin - and don't were light clothin
2
We were very disappointed in the service and the cost of the dinner. We only received one set of utensils to shell our crab and then only a small portion of crab meat when we did eat it. We ordered a kilo or slightly over and barely felt like we got a real taste at all. We had waited a good amount of time for our dinner to arrive and therefore could not meet the time that we were meant to leave the table?, overall it was not a nice dining experience for $170.00!!!
4
It's true that Jumbo has the best crab. The food there is very delicious. And we encountered a waitress from China who was very kind, helpful and patient. Overally, it was a nice experience.
5
I ordered chilly crab, fried rice and cereal prawn.
All of them are very delicious.
I recomment these three food to all visitor
4
We needed to book but got a good table lots of local people celebrating parties et cetera staff very helpful food different but good high-quality and interesting love the crab
4
Chinese type serving. Best dish. Cheese and Chilli Crab with Roast Bun. Steam Fish. Seafood Fried Rice. Fresh Thailand coconut.
5
Excellent experience. My family was really happy to have time in this restaurant. The best restauturant in Singapore for sure.
5
Had lunch here on 9th Feb. Scallops to start which were well cooked and plentiful.Chicken & Salted Fish Fried Rice followed which tasted great. The portion size was massive and that was the small portion.Restaurant was very busy, would definitely eat here when in Singapore next
3
The food is excellent with fresh crab and shrimp, and the view is good along the river. However, my friend and I are not satisfied with the service. The lady gave us advice for ordering 2kg+ crab and a fried rice, however, we are two short and thin ladies, and the time we ordered it was 10:00 p.m.. When we then wanted her advice on ordering crab and shrimp, she still recommended the 2kg+ one, which is two big big dishes, and we were astonished!!!!!!! The total for our two ladies was over $470
1
The restaurant was full when we got there and were given a ticket to wait in line for about 1/2 an hour. Not ideal but we waited. Finally we were called but were told we had to share with people on a larger table or wait another 20 mins for another table! Was not going to pay a lot of money for seafood and get to share a table, while others had a great table by the river! The fact that they even offered to do so was for me, unbelievable. No Thanks! i am not that desperate to eat over priced seafood! So we left. It was a bit of a cattle run. Very poor customer service i think for a "so called" good restaurant
4
Had the chilli crab, mango and lamb salad, fried rice and cereal shrimps. Cant remember exact names but hope you get the gist. The shrimps were so good, the chilli crab excellent and juicy. Mango salad was too sweet and fried rice very plain when it cost $20 for a small. Was hit with a massive bill after our meal ($190 for a couple) and we finished everything but the rice. I recommend the joint, and book at least one day prior as it gets hella busy. Try and get seated indoors unless u want to sweat to death outside. Dont go on your first date too lo
1
Singapore may have progressed in their infrastructure and massive concrete jungle but they have gone back in terms of customer service. Especially here at jumbos. You would expect for a costly place like this you could get decent service. Not so. The guy at the front counter was the least helpful and unfriendly we had come across. After standing around for 20 minutes like a fool, I asked him again if we could get a table. It was then we were told we had to register and get a number via their computer booking system. After that booking there's another wait to be seated. The food for the price was nice but not amazing. Would not go back nor recommend solely based on the lack of customer focus and poor service.
3
almost the taste of food was good. Jumbo is very popular restaurant and there were many many people.
But I think the price of food is too expensive. There are lots of restaurants with reasonable price.
4
I reserved the seats by the official website. It's good to have a nice view table. The waiter is nice and give a lot advice to order dishes.
5
cause made a reservation before，so it's really a fantastic experience and beautiful view with nice dishes！
5
the dinner very much ! Will definitely visit next time and will share my review with friends. Thank you!
4
The usual at Jumbo. Chili crab tasting good. Enjoyed with a nice and ice cold Tiger beer. Service a bit rush but always been that way. Overall a good experience.
5
came here with my wife to taste the famous chili crabs. long queue as expected but handled nicely with a given number and call to the handphone. i must say the chili crabs were fantastic. the bill was high but it is worth it. i will come here again...
1
Crab was good, however, the whole experience was very poor due to dishonesty with hidden charges and extras. Ordered two crabs, both different sizes but both billed as 1kg each... extras such a tea and nuts which were offered in a complimentary style turned out to be an additional cost. This is very misleading as other companies provide this type of thing for free. Service okay, 1 drink was wrong. Restaurant was pretty busy but food came out in a reasonable time. Bill was $180 for 2 crabs, mini buns, 2 soft drinks. Marked down review due to deception for hidden costs.
4
We decided to try the chilli crab here and waited 30 minutes. The place was packed so had to queue for a seat. The chilli crab was huge and cooked in chilli sauce. It tasted more like they had just dipped it in the bottled chilli sauce so was a bit disappointed. But the outdoor seating was very nice with a view of the river. The crab was big and enough for the two of us
1
Second time I go there and second time I have the same bad experience, feeling of being pushed, pressurized and cheated.Poor service, slow, dirty. 1) always saying there is no choice for size of crabs and pushing for buying big Ines only, not providing proper forks and crab opener until asked many times, not providing water and forcing for buying bottle water2) vegetables arriving 15 min before the crabs and getting cold by then3) toilets awfully dirty, inacceptable for such expensive restaurants, bowls and glasses dirty, below tables is a garbage.They even locked the toilets of their inside restaurants (saying it is out of order) to force us to go to the public toilets of the mall...appealing.I have been a big fan of jumbo so far but it is the last time I am going there. It is a pity because the food has potential but the reputation of jumbo seafood is overlived
1
We were two people and went there to try the famous chilli crab. When we got to the door they told us that this day only set menus was available, and surprise, all the set menus were starting for 4 people. Of course we end up not eating there as that would have been too much food waste and too expensive too.
3
Good food, must try chili crab, good view of the Singapore River, a bit pricey, long waiting time, poor service.
4
A classic chaotic Chinese restaurant where you can eat good food and drink local beer. The location is quite nice and the service fast and efficient but crowded. The specialty is the jumbo crab, really delicious
Price above the average and not justified.
5
went here for dinner, ordered the chilli crabs weighing approx 1kg and cereal prawns,both dishes yummy!!lovely place at the riverside.polite staff!!
5
easy for booking. My friends and my family had a very nice lunch there. the king crab is delicious. My friends love black pepper one more than the spicy crab. the reason is the spicy is a little bit sweet which they don't like.
5
Good menu options..Tasty food.. beautiful view.. good service. This restaurant serves all at one place.
3
the fish which the waiter recommend us doesnt worth its price at all，tasted very common，but it cost more than 350 Sin dollars！its terrible！
5
Tasty fresh seafood!! Best place to have chilli crabs!! Don't forget the buns for the sauces!! Service is lacking... would hope the management could improve on it.
3
This is a good restaurant to try on your first time in Singapore but it's wayyy too overpriced! We had a set menu that was 168$ (Singapore dollars) including drinks. At the end they brought us a bill of 204$. Including service charge. They are very smart so be carefully. Take a good look at the menu because they show it to you very quickly (the set menu) so that you don't read that's excluding service charge. Also, they serve you some tea and nuts and you assume that is complimentary but NO! They charge without even telling you. It felt like they ripped me off! And I have to say that the crab we had was not 1kg, way far from that! Not even a half kg! Crazy, but I have to say that the food was good! The service is slow though! Very slow!
5
It wasn't our first visit and it certainly won't be our last. We always bring our visiting friends from overseas to this restaurant at this outlet for a taste of the famous Singaporean style crab. This time, however, it started raining halfway through our meal, but the staff were fast in arranging another table for us indoors, and even replaced us with a new beverage when one of the beverages got drenched by rainwater. Definitely worth a visit!
5
The big round tables is a great place to meet other people enjoying seafood served presented and repaired very well. Lobster was fresh and ample size, side dishes were delicious. We went serval other visiting couples and three young locals at our table . We had great fun watching each other dissect our crab and lobsters . A bit pricy but worth it
2
Food is average, but won't go in the future. If you want to use a lot Chinese waiter, train them well!!
4
A very good place to have a try on Singapore food. Nice service, comfortable weather, the city view near the river is fantastic, of course the crab is amazing
4
Yummy crabs and Fried Mantau. Service was decent. Location also nice by the riverfront. A little bit pricey.
Recommended.
4
the menu is big and full of options. The taste and presentation is good too. Avoid going there on weekends as it would be tough to find space without reservation. Food is pricy compared some other sea food options nearby.
5
It is my unforgetble experience in Sigapore. The restaurant is just beside the river, and prereservation make my family to get the seat without waiting. The seafood is delicious and suitable for my family.
5
Out of the way? Very much so, but a 20-minute taxi ride will get you there. A popular stop for caucasian tourists? Very much not, but it's their loss.Our visit was occasioned by a strong recommendation from the Manager of the Lounge at Four Seasons Hong Kong, who assured us we would eat the best chili crab in Singapore, and eat it we did. The place is huge, and the preferred seating is on the open patio facing the river, but we had to be a little insistent to get a good table. Then the fun began. Despite the language barrier, our helpful waitress assisted us in our choices, including for instance the delicious sweet rolls so very necessary for the broth after the crab has been vanquished. This is a messy business! but it seems the tablecloth serves too as a napkin, the supplied plastic gloves, although awkward, were a good idea, and we even found ourselves in conversation with some English-savvy neighbours.A wonderful evening under the stars and an unforgettable meal. I insist you try it..
4
We have overseas visitors and had dinner at Jumbo Seafood Riverside. We seated outside as it was not humid and inside the restaurant was crowded. It was crowded considering a Monday evening. The chilly crab was fantastic and my visitors love it. The service standard was do-able, but I would expect better given we paid good money for the food
4
Mixed service but excellent food at this popular, bustling site. Their specialty is the chili crab, which is expensive but unforgettable. The fried shrimp (they offer both peeled and shell-on versions) are fantastic. And we topped off with an order of the supreme seafood fried rice, which was delicious. The bill came to about $200 US with 2 beers, so it's not the cheapest restaurant, but the experience is fantastic, eating under the stars, by the river, with a lot of food enthusiasts. It's more of a family style restaurant than I imagined, and the service is erratic. They want to churn you through and give you a time that you have to leave your table, but it didn't look like the deadlines were rigorously enforced. Definitely get a reservation online, to avoid the confusing waiting system
3
After reading others reviews was really looking forward to visiting this establishment. Food was acceptable. Service was appalling. It was a Saturday night we happily waited for a table. Our number was up- was led to a table which still hasn't been cleared. Items were quickly removed but table never wiped over. Left with menus eventually had to ask to order even though 3 different tiger beer waitresses had kept asking us if we wanted beer. Food came out very sporadically- steamed rice arrived after we had almost finished the dishes that should have accompanied it. Half our drinks didn't turn up until we asked again half way through our meal. We asked if we could order another main to share- was given a menu but never had follow up from a waitress to order. My only regret was we didn't order the crab as i know this is what everyone raves about - after this night i doubt we will return to sample it.

If you like a local atmosphere and dine by the river, then this is the place to be. We booked this on the internet and the staff could not be more welcoming. The chilli crab was to die for, very messy but great fun. Not fine dining but a great choice of wine and beers.This was a great start t our short visit to Singapore.June 201
3
You need to wait to dine, it's fine if the food is good, but in this case, this restaurant is overrated and expensive. Chili crab just so so and some other dishes we order just simply blend and tasteless. Go elsewhere to dine.
4
Waitresses were not good. Foods were excellent. Little spicy and sweety! Different from other chilly crabs.
4
Good chili and black pepper crabs. The deep fried tilapia was also crispy. The asparagus was bitter though.
4
The Chili Crab and Pepper Crab are both incredible here. Atmosphere is great. But the prices are pretty high for the amount of food you get. Still worth it i guess.
4
When dining outlet like this get too popular, guests are given time slot of 2 hours to complete the meal and socialising. No doubt food, service and location are perfect, one is put off when we have friends and important clients to entertain. It's difficult to explain to foreigners that we have to vacate the table within the short window of time. It's no longer has the relaxed atmosphere of dining pleasure.
3
Food is very nice (we had a chilly crab and a black pepper crab), although it is quite expensive (S$70 to S$80 each). The restaurant also charges separately for the tea and the nuts served, be aware of it! The place is not the best option for hanging out for dinner with a group of friends, as you are expected to leave the table as soon as you finish your meal (waiters are pretty much in a rush for getting people in the waiting line in) and there is no table available for more than 8 people.

Jumbo is certainly not the cheapest food in Singapore; in fact it is pretty expensive. It is also packed. Why? It is certainly among the most refined manifestations of Singapore cooking, with flavours that are rich and unforgettable. The obvious headliner is the chilli crab, but everything I tried there was very tasty. The staff seems hurried because they are -- there is a line outside the door -- but in the end the service was satisfactory and seemed genuinely concerned with our satisfaction. Regrettably it is not a place to linger, despite the riverfront location; the tables are reserved in tight sequences. We had Christmas dinner there, and it was memorable indeed. Go early to get a table for dinner
4
food was very good but others are soso.because explanation of servers was a little lack, and some of the manu(rice) was absented before I asked more. also it is better to note the charge of food(crab menu).but I will go to there if I go tour to Singapore
5
Most guides for chilli crab will mention Jumbo seafood and the honest truth is that the food here is amazing. As with most seafood placed the prices are expected to be on the high end but this being a chain it is slightly better priced than its major competitors. Between three guys we ordered the chilli crab, the bracket pepper crab, 12 rolls and a small rice. Food was delicious and we could have probably done without the rice. Definitely recommende
3
My friends wanted to have a nice seafood dinner. After reading reviews online, we have decided on Jumbo. However we were disappointed to find that most dishes were mediocre (and 2 of my friends have an upset stomach afterwards). Fortunately the service at the restaurant was decent. But for the price we paying, we expected slightly better (and cleaner) food
5
I had a nice view seat at near river side.
When I gave an order for Dinner, I told that It was first time to visit here.
So the staff(Sorry, I din't remember his name) kindly recommended nice meal.
Thank you!
4
We ordered chilli crab(medium size), fried rice with egg and fried prawn with pumpkin puree for 2adults and 2children. The taste was very good and we recommend to taste one of fried prawn as well.
5
Lovely food and an authentic Singapore experience. My only minor complaint was that staff were a little slow to take our order. Once it was taken everything came out quickly and was yummy!
4
nice view,comfortable have supper with whole family,price a little higher.Unfortunately it was rain that night.
5
Excellent food, great chilli and black pepper crab, great service, price $$$$ but worth it. Also try the cereal prawns and the Singapore slings better than Raffles hotel!
5
Jumbo restaurant never disappointed me, in term of quality and service, the alasaka crab very delicious.
2
It is Just normal, not very good and tasty, and overprice~ I would recommend mellben more than jamboo.
4
highly recommend prawns, even better than signature chili crab! Excellent food and atmosphere! will comd again
5
Took my son for his birthday and he told me not only was it the best birthday dinner ever, it was the highlight of the holiday to Malaysia and Singapore! We procrastinated where to experience chilli crab given some of the reviews indicate jumbo is a bit touristy and expensive. However decided to give it a try and see for ourselves. We arrived around 6.30pm without a reservation, and although had to enter details into computer for a text alert when our table was available it took only 3 minutes. Once seated they were quick to take our door order, being drinks and pour tea.Looking around the other diners, nearly every single table has the chilli crab this place is famous for, they can't all be wrong surely! So we ordered a small crab, fried rice with egg and a house special dish of cod fish, egg and broccoli, which was all served within around 15 mins. The crab was succulent, lots of flesh perfectly cooked and very tasty sauce. We were delighted with our meal! There are a lot of staff here, they seem a little frazzled and busy hence friendly and not up for a chat, but most diners are also tourists so lots of chatting and comparing meals going on! The only hiccup I had was they brought a glass of house wine in a very badly cracked glass, it took me a couple of waiters before they changed it. And of course the price of wine was horrendous but that's Singapore! The total bill was 220 all up, for two people with 2 drinks each. Overall very happy we decided to go here and whilst pricey, was a great experience and worth it.
3
We were very excited to be going to Jumbo and having the chilli and pepper mud crabs. So when we arrived and had to wait for over an hour for a table things didn't get off to a good start. The chilli mud crab was not tasty at all and very expensive for the size. They had run out of vegetables despite it being only 915pm. Next time in Singapore we will be trying somewhere else for this speciality.
5
We ordered fried tillapia fish bumbu nyonya which is very delicious. Their service was also excellent. I will definitely want to come back later.
1
This restaurant survives through good location. Food and especially service are terrible. They are not caring for customers nor any flexible. Prices are significantly above Singapore average. Don't even think once. There are other great seafood restaurants in Singapore.
3
The food was just okay...forgettable at best... Speaking of forgettable, the server forgot about us repeatedly. We had to ask 3 times for our drinks. One finally came out but the second one never did. They over charged us on our bill. Location is good, but not worth going to. Expensive for what you get
5
You cannot go past this chain of restaurants to experience the crab dishes, we took our family there for lunch, yes it was packed full of locals and business people tucking in! We opted for the less messy executive lunch and had a wonderful array of entrees including a magnificent crab ice cream - crab meat rolled into a cone with corn and spices - so delicate and tasty - we then had a choice of pepper and chilli crab - small tasting plates with the the crab claw steeped in their special spices and sauces - just wonderful, then the half lobster comes out beautifully prepared and grilled fresh from the tank! We had wonderful service from the staff who were obviously extremely busy but made time for us and served us well. This is an experience to undertake and would recommend this overtime we are visiting Spore - clark quay has the views which are lovely night or day. Overall value for money we thought for four people including wines, beers and soft drink was approx S$100 a head which given Sydney prices was very reasonable
4
Had a lovely night hereFirst, the good points.- The meal was delicious.- the wait time was only 30 minutes instead of the quoted 60-90 minutes.- the staff were all attentive.The 2 downsides both relate to the price - This place is not cheap.- What shocked me most was the extra charge for the peanuts and Chinese tea that they put on our table without us ordering itBesides that we had an excellent night
2
We got a nice table and enjoyed the view of Clarke Quay, the coulerful touristic attraction in SG, but ... unfortunately this was the best we got from Jumbo Sea Food. The menu is limited, the quality of the food is just average as the service (all plates were served just warm).On top of that, Jumbo Seafood, a super touristic place, it's serving shark Fin soup to look a "genuine" Chinese sea food restaurant... also for this reason we will never go again... bye bye Jumb
4
I made the reservation a week ago, like most customers do I suppose. However, when we got there to order the biggest crab they had they unfortunately said they didn't have the big crabs anymore. I would understand running out of crabs if most of their customers are walk-ins. But at Jumbo most customers reserve at least 3 days beforehand, so forecasting needed crabs would be so much easier. And yet, they were out of stock. I recommend inventory management training for the person in charge. Thanks.
1
We visited as a family last week just as the restaurant was getting ready to close for lunch. They rushed us into ordering quickly before the kitchen closed. After ordering the chilli crab and a fresh fish, we were then presented with a bill of $700 SGD. As the food was being cooked we were forced to pay before we ate the tasteless $350 crab. In hindsight we should have asked for this immediately before we ordered. They also completely ignored our table and did not provide us with the aprons like most other tables. The only good thing about this place was the fried rice and noodles, but you can get that anywhere else in Singapore so I would stay away!!
3
We were served by manager (outside) at table 83 at 8.30pm on 26/12/2016. His attitude was very impolite, did not give us time to read through the menu basically he only gave us a few minutes to take a look at the menu and rushed us to order. He treated other customers politely but not us. He purposely didn't provide us the gloves and apron despite we order crabs but only when we asked for them. Although we insisted to drink ice water, but he kept persuading us to order some other drinks.
4
We had a meal there on a Christmas Day, the restaurant was just meters away from our hotel. I wanted a eat a crab but it was so huge I desired not to. The prawns were very tasty. I didn't like the baby squid so my husband had it instead and said it was quite good. The only thing I didn't like that they bring tea and nuts which you expect to be free as you didn't order it but then they include it in the bill. The staff was very good and helpful and the location is excellent with a fantastic view to the river if you sit outside and it's not raining
5
Singapore Pepper Crab, the best place to have this! It's just too good and mouthwatering to turn a cold shoulder to. Just too good!
3
We being served in the upstairs, only 1 or 2 waitresses and we found it very hard to call them. However, they are served in a good manner.
4
Good foods for an average value. Nice ambient at Riverside Point if sitting outside. Reservation is a must, else may need to wait 45-60 minutes.
5
Good location, nice food and good service! Never disappoints me for all these years. Strongly recommend to friends visiting from overseas!
4
Took quite a while for us to be seated, as it was peak period. However food was promptly served and service was good.
5
Had dinner with the family. The chilli crab is simply stunning. It's a great restaurant on the side of the river. Service is fast and efficient and the choice of wines very good. The place was packed with locals and the whole experience was outstanding
4
Whenever we have overseas guests, we will take them to Jumbo for a chilli crab dinner. The staff is always polite and food is good. Will be back for more.
5
Chilli crab to die for. That is it. Each time I eat there, I wipe the chilli crab sauce clean off the plate with the crispy bun! Love it! Can't afford to go often though. It is expensive.
3
The three of us went here, and had a total of three dishes: chili crab, seafood fried rice, and pumpkin prawns. The meal was delicious, but we were shocked by the bill (specifically the cost of the crab, which was more than $100SGD). At that point, it was too late: we just paid and left. But it was a sad end to what otherwise was a lovely (light/smallish) dinner.
3
This restaurant located in the famous BQ areaI've been there for a business dinner and apart of the fantastic view that all similar restaurants in the street offer I have nothing to comment.It's a typical seafood restaurant with a typical Singaporean menu.The plates we ordered were just average quality and nothing more to mention.I am not sure what different its neighbors could offer but suggest to try another one and hope you will have a better luck.
5
In Jumbo restaurant, I experienced funny dining! My family and friends thanked for me to visit jumbo. If I go to singapore again, I will actually jumbo restaurant. Especially, I rememberd nice river view. I don't forget it. thank you !
4
We were told this was a top seafood restaurant in Singapore and it did nto disappoint. We shared the pepper Crab and some Prawns. The food was tasty (specially the prawns) . I would eat there again .
5
We always dine at Jumbo whenever we're in Singapore. Food is always the best! We got there earlier than our reservation time and we were able to get a table right away.
4
Been there for lunch, chilly crab is very good not too spicy. Messy dish but worth it! Staff is nice but average, nothing special there.
4
Took a few visitors from Malaysia there last Saturday. They have never had chili crab before.Ordered a few dishes, of course including our famous chilli crab, for a group of 5 and we were all happy with the meal. We had chosen to sit outside by the river, and Clarke Quay was full of buzz even late into the night. The restaurant opens till midnight, hence good for those who want a late dinner
3
We revisited as had past good dining experience. The location remained good and reservation system is sophisticated. However the main food, chilli crab is no longer so special, size is now smaller and crab meat is not so solid. More surprise is the price per crab even small one is expensive..
5
This is one of the best seafood restaurants I have ever been to. Visited Singapore a second time just to come back to this restaurant because there no restaurants back at home who does Chili Mudcrabs like here. Worth the money and make sure to book before hand if your going for dinner as it gets really busy. I will forever come to this restaurant just for the great quality and value of food.
3
We decided we should have chilli crab whilst in Singapore and Jumbo seemed to be highly recommended. Whilst there was no complaints about the quality of food it was very expensive and it felt like we were being rushed get more customers in the door. All in all a very impersonal experience and a big let down.
3
Came here to try the famous chili crab.I think I prefer the pepper crab. I am not surprise it is quite expensive overall.Ambience is pretty tight space wise and a bit noisy inside. But one thing that stands out is the service where the waitress will attend to you despite the crowd
5
Oh Yes, the famous JUMBO. Something You should not miss while You are in Singapore. The one located at the Riverside gives You not just a fantastic taste-orgasm but also a pretty view to the River. Be prepared that there are 2 JUMBO's along the River, the main one closer to the Clark Quay and a satellite one around 1km from the main one. When the main one is full, the staff will escort You to the satellite one. Go for the starters, they are just fantastic or go for the Chili Crab, You will not regret
4
Nice ambience with nice food. Location was also good. However, this place is very tough to make reservations.
4
My family members visited Singapore and wanted to try Chilli carb. It was a great success and I recommend highly this place. A bit expensive but it's worth it.
4
So lucky to be able to get place at the river side for the family diner. Enjoyed the evening and nice food at this restaurant. Will definitely come to this place again with my whole family:)
5
I have visited SG 3times so far. Whenever I go to SG, my first meal is at JUMBO SEAFOOD. It never let me down.
5
Very good one n the best foods ever in singapore... It was very excellent foods n environment... Everything was excelent n satify but except the price lil bit very expensive.... Hopefully will come again n difinately....
3
I must admit I have been to Singapore many times but never been here before.We had just arrived in Singapore and wanted not much more than something light.We decided to try it. Service was excellent and we just had some noodles and rice and a drink .Personally I did not think much of the fried rice with egg , it was a little thin in terms of content .However the Singapore noodles my wife ordered were fantastic.Loved them and mixed them with my rice to give it some flavour.While we thought for rice , noodles a beer and water was a bit expensive I enjoyed it and would try it again when we return in October 201
4
Had dinner with my wife, great service, good not great food, mid plus pricing in the Clark Quay entertainment centre, after or before dinner lots of bars with live music from rock to piano bay styles. If your a tourist wanting a good international style experience. You can't go wrong eating here
5
Definitely worth booking in advance, even on a mid-week evening, we had a nice evening with a good breeze so it was nice and comfortable sitting outside overlooking the river. They do have a separate vegetarian menu if you ask for it. The chilli crab was excellent, as expected, and the cereal prawns are always a favourite. Also tried the peppered venison and it was delicious
4
Singapore is really a foodies paraside and trying chilli crab is a super must!! It so delicious with its red gravy. The plain bite size buns that go with it are absolutely yummy too. Our SG hosts took us to Jumbo Seafood at Clarke Quay. Itâ€™s a very happening place with a lot of resturants, bars, and shops. A place filled with a lot of energy. I cannot wait to go back and eat chili crab!
3
We were told this is a must see placeWe saw a barge with lights and vivid coloured painting and sculptures What can I say it was a free trip to the restaurant provided by the Jumbo don't get fooled by peddler of other Junks for feesThis place is best seen at night only its a waist of time for a day trip not much to look at seemed very ordinary and unkeptAt night you don't see the flaws Go for the lights and photo op food it so-so and expensiveStaff are friendly and attentiv
4
We had an excellent meal here with ok service. All the food we got was good, in particular the chilli crab was good and the venison was superb.
3
Strange booking system - take a number even when you book before hand - Chillli crab ws fab - expensive but beautiful presentation - setting great even when we had to move when it rained. Very crowded
4
We have been patronising Jumbo Restaurant for many years and I must say it has never failed to please. Food quality is consistently good, service tip-top and the atmosphere at the Riverside Point branch is simply fantastic!
1
Without the location to prop this chain restaurant, it would not exist. The food is acceptable, the environment commercial and the service barely passable. It perhaps appeals to tourists, but I think not for return customers.I was hoping maybe third time lucky, but I think never again for me
3
This is not the 1st time I visited the restaurant but was not impressed this time round. Firstly, the staff there is not paying attention to the tables even though the place is clearly not crowded. Secondly, the staff is clearly not clear with all the membership terms. And worse not understanding simple English. My sis is trying to redeem her birthday vouchers and asked the staff there for advice. The staff instead say she's not sure and ask whether my sis can speak to her in chinese instead. My sis chinese is not very fluent and hence request to have someone who knows how to speak english instead. And the manger attended to us still use chinese. Thus we had a hard time conveying our message to them.. Lastly, we are given the table from 6-7;30pm. But the communication part already taken us nearly 30mins and we are left with only 1hr to finish our food. Luckily the food was serve relatively fast.
5
If you go to Singapore you must try the pepper crab. The Jumbo group of restaurants are a great place and very popular so book online if you have a particular time to eat in mind. If not just walk in, you`ll only have a short wait .
3
The place is along the seaside, approximately half an hour from around orchard Rd by uber. Staff was attentive and always around when needed.According to my companion the taste of the chili crab head changed since the last visit a few years back. I didn't have this comparison so to me it was tasty. A lot of meat but maybe a tad too much sauce. Tip: bring along or all for plastic gloves. I didn't think of it and my hands were smelly until the next day no matter how often I washed them. We sat inside upstairs which was clean and air-conditioned. Wouldn't sit outside as you're risking flies when it gets dark.Overall a good experience, food was well prepared and tasty. Good for groups
4
Went there because of a recommendation from a Singaporean friend for the chilli crab. Ordered that and pepper crab as well. The chilli crab was very good but I actually preferred the pepper crab by a wide margin. You walk into the place knowing it will be a bit pricey but it was worth it and I would go there again
4
We have been frequenting this place for a few years now just to indulge in on the famous chilli mud crabs. Once again the food did not disappoint us. A small bowl of peanuts and jasmin tea is brought to the table immediate as you sit down and you will go WOW this is nice. There is however a charge for it which is not disclosed until you get your bill.As with most successful restaurants prices go up when they are successful and this place is no exception. 
4
Jumbo Seafood is a well established restaurant in Singapore and have been popular with tourists as well as locals for many years. As we were a group of 9, we opt for a set menu which consist of 9 or 10 shared dishes and cost about SGD$800. The set menu offers us to taste other seafood and the world famous Singapore Chilli crabs. If I was to visit Jumbo Seafood again, I would not opt for the set menu as it was too much. I would go there for their chilli crabs
5
Had 3 meals here ( 1 lunch & 2 dinners ) heaps to choose from the menu great atmosphere dining alfesco along the river which is nice and cool. Their chips are awesome.

The best chilli crab we tasted so far. The sauce was different the best, the price was ok but to experience it was very good.
4
Black pepper crab or chili crab where you can order sweet buns to dip with the chili crab sauce. The salted egg prawns and seafood stuffed beancurd are good side dishes.
4
The restaurant is located along The walkway. We choose a menù, starting with a good pumpkin soup, therefore a piece of chili crap, easy to eat and tasty,and a good dessert. Water to drink, a price of sing.dollar 65.the service is careful and efficient.
4
My wife and I were in Singapore for the first time in late October and several people recommended eating at Jumbo's. It was nice. The food was excellent and the service decent. We found it a little pricy. Dinner for two with no alcohol was $140 US
4
Another outing in Singapore with the team and another attempt at getting some good crab. This time we went a bit wild with our ordering and chose smaller crabs and a bunch of other specialities. Pork belly (lovely) jumbo prawns (very good if a little sweet) and the pepper crab. It delivered on all levels and I can say I left there one very happy bunny
5
The Chili Crab was great as it was the deep fried Tilapia. A bit pricey but overall worth it. Good service despite limited English Language skills. We had a table outside which was too close to their desk where they store plates, glasses Etc resulting in some disturbance. Other than that all was really good.
3
Service was okay, we got a table in 10 minutes by walking in on a Monday evening. Chili crab was good but a bit too expensive ($78 for one). The fried mantou (bun) was good to go with the chili crab and so as the fried rice. We ordered a spinach dish that was just average. Ambience and food is good but a bit too expensive. Guess it's very tourist oriented
5
Jumbo seafood is a must visit for anyone who loves seafood and visits Singapore. They are famous for the crabs. You are even given an attractive "Jumbo" apron so that you need not worry about spills and spoils. The view is great - overlooking the quay - riverside. Wonderful experience! The view is best enjoyed at night when the entire area is lit up
2
I brought my 2 sisters there for their birthday celebration dinner. Unfortunately, we were not satisfy with the food and service there. As the Sri Lanka crab looks much smaller than 1kg though was told at 1kg. And through out the meal, service was slow. Even for dessert, they will serve you 15 - 20 mins apart from the 1st dessert was served. Overall, the food taste was ok
5
Good place, food, atmosphere, with friends or family.
Will return to enjoy best food when visit Singapore again!
4
Nothing to complain about the crabs, except pricing. Nice restaurant at the riverside. Table & seating can be improved.
4
Classic south East Asian seafood meal by the riverside serving some of the best Singapore Chili Crab in Clarke Quay. On my recommended list.
4
food was very nice, table & seat were not very comfortable, but overall was good. A little bit expensive
5
The food is good. The environment is nice. We are arranged to sit indoor so the experience this time is great!
5
friendly service staffs and nice food. because i was there during the afternoon on a weekdays so there were alot of seats available.
4
Booked this place before we left Australia so we could get in. Seems to be very popular and they do warn you that your table may be needed after an hour and a quarter. The food comes out fairly quickly so you are finished in that time.Be warned this is a very touristy place and they play a little game when you turn up, making you hang about a bit (even though you have booked) so it looks like customers are queuing to get in ,Singaporeans love a queue !Jumbo's reputation for Chilli Mud Crab is well deserved and its fresh and delicious. The crab is sold but weight but there is no consultation with the customer first, our crab was enough for 2 people and was just less than 100 SG. There are tables outside with a nice view over the river or if you don't like the heat you can dine inside.Service was fast but a little artificial with the feeling that numbers through the door was the game. It was also annoying to find that the nice little bowl of peanuts you were given on arrival along with a cup of non solicited Jasmin Tea were all on the bill. Takes the shine off a bit.Verdict: good food with a good view and a little expensive
3
All i can say is the singapore chilli crab was ok but burned financially and certainly not worth the amount we paid or even the amount we thought it was when we ordered but for three adults and one 4 year old child, the cost for few dishes and 1 jug of sprite we thought was expensive but at a stretch we would cope with at around $170 quickly escalated to just over $200 after + % service charges and + % gst ! Only caught unaware once, that listed prices don't include gst and service charges! So be aware
4
After researching and reading reciews we decided on Jumbo for our Singapore Crab experience and we're not dissapointed.Opted to pick our own dishes instead of picking from set menu.A little bit more expensive but we were happier as we were able to pick that we wanted.The crab was tasty and there was plenty for 2 people.Would also recommend the duck and mango salad along with the scallop and yam ring.Just be mindful that lunch finishes at 3:30 PM
5
There are many sea food restaurants in Singapore but this is the best. It' s on Clarke Quay and after dinner you can hang around with the fantastic pubs and bars.If you don' t have a reservation have to wait for a while (sometimes up to 30 minutes) to have a table after getting the ticket from the que machine. Don' t sit inside, prefer outside especially the tables closed to the river road. The hostesses that welcomes in the front not so kind that you don' t feel really welcomed! But the serving staff is better.I recommend;Chili Crab (hot)MPrawn Salted EggSea Food Rise (big portion)Deep fried BunsAsparagusDesert of Pamelo & sagoAvarage;Black Pepper Crab (hot)Baby SquidYAM. ScallopPrawns in cerea
3
Jumbo has a good reputation with locals, but our visit didn't live up to expectation. The food was good, if on the expensive side, but the service was slow.
5
Very delicious sea food.
The location is nice. It worth to stroll the nearby area after meals.
The crabs are a must, espcious chili crabs.
Make sure to make reservation for this dining place is so popular.
4
There was no cutlery to cut crab easily. And staffs were unfriendly. Taxi driver didn't know exact location.
3
Pumpkin prawn is nice.The serving quite reasonable.Very slow in topping up tea and the staff are not very attentive.
4
It's bit costly to pay $318 for 4 pax however food is fresh except for prawns cereals.
Will definitely go again but not ordering the shark fins soup is $18 per small bowl.
2
We wanted to eat outside but the reserved seats were inside and it was too cold.. Chilli crab was really great. You should try.
5
the chili crab is out of this world. great view and atmosphere in the outdoor seating. Good price too for the service and the quality of food. Strongly recommend to everyone big group or jst a couple's dinner.
5
Ok by far best pepper crab around. Great service with great choices to select from. The location is perfect right at Clarke Quay.
4
We ate a late lunch just before they closed. It was still crowded. This service is adequate but they are always moving and many don't understand English well. Anyway, we ordered the wok fried cod which was crispy outside and flaky white inside with a nice spicy sauce. We had local greens sautÃ©ed with sambal. Finall, we had the chilli crab which was very good and quite messy to eat. But worth the experience. Recommended
4
In search of the famous chili crab I came across this restaurant and boy am I glad I did. It was pretty busy and I had a short wait. The restaurant was a nice size and the service swift but not warm or welcoming. I ordered the chili crab and the seafood fried rice. The chili crab takes 30 minutes but worth the wait. I would have preferred it spicier but my guess is that they are trying cater to a more milder pallette. The was a good spot to get chili crab.
5
The best crab definitely in Singapore. Great outdoor location and total value for money at the pricing .
5
I make it a point to eat a meal each time i visit Singapore great variety of sea food excellent service Long beach has great view and ambiance
5
I was told this was the best place for chilli crab. What an experience. Messy but delicious and fun. Very helpful staff
5
I visit Singapore first time.
I am Korean.
Jumbo restaurant very very good.
Excellent.
Kind staff, delicious food
I go back Korea tomorrow.
Tomorrow lunch.... i will visit again^^
5
I was determined to try chilli crab on my visit to Singapore and Jumbo didn't disappoint! With a cold beer and basket of those little rolls I had a very satisfying lunch.
5
I had dinners with customer for 15 persons. All service were excellent. They have set menus for traveler but you don't miss "Crab". It's very delicious and popular menu. This brunch is located beside the river. You should come in evening. Well for visit.Don't miss if you been SG
5
The doorman at Raffles recommended this restaurant and we are glad he did. The seafood was fresh and delicious. The restaurant is very busy - the vibe casual and relaxed. Service is quick though a bit impersonal. We had the set menu which included a lobster entree and crumbed prawns. They sell the crumbed mixture to take home and I can see why! It was a delicious coconut flavour. The main course was chilli crab and it was absolutely lovely - great fresh crab and delicious sauce. They give you a little bun which our taxi driver told us later is to mop up the sauce. Sadly I found that our too late, but it was yum anyway, a cross between a doughnut and a roll. Dont put your handbag on the ground if it's been raining! Highly recommend this restaurant

The restaurant is designed to cater to the large number of tourists seeking Singapore crab. It does its job well. The food is tasty and worth a visit. Be careful of the prices - it's by weight, not dish, so the bill can add up quickly

We were there on a Monday night and had a great time. Unfamiliar with the intricacies of how to get crab meat from the shell, a young staff member Dita (Wong I think her surname was) spent a few minutes at our table teaching us how to do it. Feeling enlightened, we went head first in, had a lot of fun doing it and had a fantastic meal as a result. She really made our experience!Recommend it, very social, very messy but very good fun and I advise not to wear a white shirt and use the bibs provided. You won't feel out of place.Thanks again Dita, you had finished your shift when we finished our meal

If you happen to be in Singapore and are out for some real fine fish and sea food, head to Jumbo! Especially their Chilicrab and the lobster are a must! It might be like in a big waiting hall of a bus station since it is quite loud and hectic, but the food is just worth it. Don't forget to make a reservation, otherwise the waiting line will be almost endless
4
Great variety of seafood. Chili crabs and scallops are awesome! My friend tried stake and was very happy. It is a pity they have only indoor seating.
5
Always enjoy taking family and friends to Jumbo. Love the food and atmosphere. Pricey but the service at this branch is the best
3
The Chili crab used to be really good. But this time, the dishes were served cold and taste so-so. Was disappointing. Service was good.
4
Fresh Chili crab but price so high.
I went here last 3 year teste be the same. Good place near liver.
4
This much holds its ground, keeping chili crab at its best along with good service all through the dinner
3
The crab is not the best in Singapore but the mee goreng is. At a location where it is always full (even on weekdays) but they have a system in place where you key in your mobile number and they can call you when ur queue number is up while u walk around the areaâ€¦like a tourist
1
I visit riverside point outlet and worst service ever. The cups was dirty asked 3 time to change it and i did pointed out wrong amount on the bill but he keep insist the wrong amount, he changed bill without any apologies only after show him the price on the menu
5
Recommend you book but no problem with walk ins. Service good and efficient. We had duck salad, venison and green pepper, chicken satay and also chill crab. Could not fault any of the food it was all delicious. Go here you will definitely enjoy. Very tasty

This restaurant was recommended to us as the place to go to get the best Singapore Chili Crab. We arrived at 1.30 in the afternoon for lunch, and were told that last orders were at 2.15 and the restaurant closed at 3pm, and were asked if that would be ok for us. It would, so we were shown to a table. There were only a few other custoemrs in at this time.As we were seated the waited took our drinks order. 15 minutes later our drinks arrived. We knew what we wanted to order (Chili Crab) and our menus had been closed on the table since about 2 minutes after we arrived. After we had been there for almost 30 minutes we called a waiter over and asked if we could order, please.Upon ordering, our food came reasonably quickly, and was delicious. We had no complaints about the food at all. I would say it was worth waiting for, but we shouldn't have had to wait that long for our drinks or to order, especially since it wasn't busy.Since chili crab is a big think in Singapore and many restaurants do it, I would say try somewhere else. I felt we should have been treated with more respect and looked after a little better given that it was quite expensive. Despite the quality of the food, I wouldn't go back
5
I have just been to Jumbo and it had to be the best Singapore Chilli Crab in town. We got there early and were seated straight away outside overlooking Clarke Quay. We asked for a small crab as it was just the two of us and it was the perfect size. The crab was fresh and the sauce is amazing with just the right amount of chilli. The friend rice is beautiful and fluffy and we got some buns to mop up the last bits of the tasty sauce. This is the third time I have visited Singapore and it's the third time I've been to this Jumbos. Outstanding food, service and location
5
Offered super fresh seafood. Every dish we ordered are awesome. Left my overseas guests talking about Jumbo for days.
4
The view I ordered it's good.The foods it's delicious but it isn't fit for us.It's very fresh,specious.It tasted good for me not for my husband.May be it's suitable for female.LoL.
5
We enjoyed the family chilli & pepper crabs lunch. the very efficient male staff took our order and estimated the right portion for 8 of us, so there was no wastage and we cleaned up all the plates. Service by 2 taiwanese lady was excellent.
3
Ambience is good at the seaside. The food is okay however the crab is quite pricey for 900g. Service is good
4
We are very happy to have a ChiliClub of Jambo Seafood. That's very taste sa reputaition. And atomsphere of the restaurant was fairly good. Lukly we had a out side seat ,and it's clear. So we could enjoy wonderful Singapore evening.Thank you very much.
5
This is very GOOD.
I Want go to the JUMBO RESTAURANT one more time!
I Will go to the JUMBO RESTAURANT one more time!

it was good enough
food was delicious
staffs are kind and friendly
but chilli crab show up late, after other foods already ate....
5
i really like the food and service . they can speak Chinese it was very helpful.we can use Unionpay ,and it was also very helpful
3
the food is good and the location is nice next to the river. not sure what's the problem with the staff of some of these popular restaurants in singapore. I guess they miss out on a lot of basic stuff. the body language is rude and they seems to be doing us a favour by taking our order and serving us food. the website said closing time 3 pm for lunch. we were there at 1.45 and they were in some kind of rush. the wanted us to leave the place by 2.30 and started moving around out table. surprisingly I had called that morning to make a reservation and I was told that the are fully booked. but when I reached there the restaurant was almost empty.
1
they r not kind and the sauce is too sweet. I think people who like here's food, they must have sweet mouth.. and they lied that it's rainy when I was asking outdoor's rable. inside is too cold.. I felf too uncomfotable with everything in there.
5
Dined at Jumbo Seafood Clarke Quay. Tried Chilli crab with mantou buns. It was awesome. Never miss this in Singapore. Tried the pepper fried lobster as well.
5
Great seafood, Book ahead otherwise you line up. Service good. Don't over order ad servings are generous. Good value.
4
Consistently good seafood menu; famous for Chilli crabs, black pepper crabs, fried seafood noodles . Many other dishes are good too. Great for lunch or dinner .
5
I had to visit jumbo when in Singapore based on previous reviews on the chilli crab. This restaurant is busy and may have to wait for a table. When we arrived we had the option of sharing a table if we wanted to be seated quicker so we chose this option. Waiting time for dinner can be 20-45min depending on table size. We ordered the small chilli crab, with two man tou (buns) and a side of small noodles. All were delicious! The crab is done by weight so it is not cheap. Our small crab was around Â£40 ~ $70. But it was worth it! The crab is fresh, spicy and comes with lots of sauce. We should of ordered more buns and not the noodles. The buns were great for soaking up the sauce. I would highly recommend this place if you haven't been before. Tip - when you arrive they place a small plate of peanuts - this is chargeable. It's not a lot but if you don't want it then let the waitress know otherwise it will be added to the bill. This is the same for tea - if they offer you tea and you don't want it as you may order your own drink then say no otherwise you will be charged.
2
it was a second time to visit here. even though the first visit was about 10 years ago, it was a totally different experience. i had highly recommended here to my hubby, but both of us were really disappointed. the inside air was toooooo cold to have a dinner, so we had to hurry to eat for warm air outside. crab and its sauce was nice, but the amount and price were ridiculous. it's toooo much for the dishes, and you can find better one everywhere in singapore. the atmosphere was pretty poor as well.
3
If you wanted to have an Overpriced Chili Crab, this is the place to go to. I am not sure why majority of the visitors to Singapore "must" to Jumbo for Chili Crab. I did that once but never again. You can get better and cheaper at other places and at some Hawker Center
3
I brought a group of Taiwanese friends to this restaurant and I am proud and glad that they liked the food. I booked through Chope and they didn't allow us to book more than one table as we had 22 of us. Hence I have to do it separately. Our guests were hungry and I had to change the booking time earlier and there were miscommunications at the counter but they allowed and arranged the tables for us! I wished the main waiter taking our order had more smiles, probably he didn't have a good day. The other waiter was kind enough to offer me glasses of water as I explained the dishes to the guests. Our bill was $400+!!! with crabs and prawns and scallops, that was quite expensive..
5
No better place in Singapore for great sea food than Jumbo. We ordered Pepper crabs and were not disappointed. Huge meaty crab cooked to perfection. The only problem with eating crabs is that it is messy. That's when we noticed a couple next to us who had come completely prepared for their crab meal. With disposable gloves and an abundant stock of tissues they could eat without getting messed up. Jumbo - will come back again suitably equipped next time.
5
Order the following:Pepper Crab, Chili Crab, deep fried buns, cereal prawns and Kang Kong. Depends on how many your are, our team of 4 we're good with a medium size order of crabs.This one is very near the boat quays restaurant. It's a little smaller with much younger (and more pleasant) waiting staff.Be careful though because EVERYTHING has a price from the nuts that are served when you arrive to every single wet tissue they give you. They won't say it but you'll see it in your bill at the end
3
As other said the taste was really good. Ingredients are fresh and well cooked. But the restaurant was very loud and the tables were too close; I even heard what people next to us said. Staffs were unkind and unfriendly at all. Moreover they didn't take any actions when I asked them something. If you think only the taste, it is really good to try. But if you concern atmosphere and other things, here is the worst restaurant
3
The food was nice but don't understand why razor clam dish always out of stock ?
It would be nice if staff automatically give us the plastic hand glove to use with Crab dish without asking first.
5
It's my second visit and my husband's first. Can't wait to go back!!! Delicious is understatement for its chilli crab! Thank you Jumbo for an experience we will always remember!
4
Having always tried the main branch at East coast park, I decided to try something different for a change with my customers. Pleasant surprise because this branch has more personalised service and is definitely better for a business dinner.
4
The crab was just beautiful. This, however, is not the place for a quiet romantic dinner. It is a very busy place and at times noisy but this adds to the atmosphere. The crab is great and the beer cold. What else could you want?
4
Reservation at later hour should be better as they always remind you to finish dinner within 1hr 15min when I reserve at 530 or 6pm.
4
Good service and the crabs are fresh and taste fantastic. It was a good thing we made reservations for dinner even though it was a weekday.
5
I was introduced to this place by locals several years ago and I always return when in town and always recommend.Simply put, I love the chilli crab here and love finishing it off by dunking the delicious fried rolls in the sauce. All the other food I've had here has been great too.Some of the comments regarding staff, size etc are true but I overlook that because I love the food so much
5
If there is something you have to keep your time and money aside on your singapore trip then, this is it. Will never forget the taste of their chilli crab. Many other seafood dishes are also available. The view and location is also great for night outs. Make sure you make your reservations or you will have to share table with others as i did! Did make some some new friends on the table though :-
4
A great location by the river, outside dining in a busy and interesting part of town. The seafood is excellent, service very good and prompt. Equal quality to the other Jumbos I have dined at. Handy to the Swissotel Merchant Court Hotel for a business lunch !
3
Jumbo is famous for its pepper crab, so I decided to have to try there. The crab was quite fresh and tasty, though a bit expensive. However, the attitude of one of their waitress was not good, she seemed to fear that I could not afford the meal and showed me the bill right after I finished the crab (I didn't ask for the bill yet), not a nice experience for customers. The night view outdoor is fabulous, but you cannot enjoy air-con if you choose to dine outdoor. After the meal, you may hang around in the Clarke Quay, there is a bridge that shows off its lightings and design in the night, and boats that can show you around, of course Yiu need to pay for it.蟹好好食，一個人可以食完一隻，有點點辣，但可以接受，加杯凍飲很不錯。外面的夜景很美，可在户外就餐，但那就沒冷氣享用。有個waitress的態度不太好，像怕我不肯給錢，我一食完蟹就把單遞給我要我給錢，很不nice
5
Have dinner with my friend who visits me from China. Very delicious crab and good environment. Deserved to try！
5
Ive now had the pleasure of eating red chilli crab twice on my all to brief visit to Singapore
It has to be one of my favourite ever meals now
At Jumbo's it was faultless
As was the Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand
5
The food was absolutely delicious, service impeccable although they were busy as always. We will return when we are next in Singapore.
4
Reserve a table, put on your bibb, and get cracking. Saucy crab, flavorful. Loved the seafood fried rice as well. Gets very busy and noisy at times. Service not the most attentive but you won't particularly care because your attention is focused on the variety of seafood placed in front of you. Lots of eateries around the riverside front area, and you can walk around looking for other joints for different types of foo

You need to go to this place with realistic expectations. Are you looking for dirt cheap chilli crab, a place that you can sit at for hours and hours and have hand and foot service? You are at the wrong place. Try a hawker centre where the crab won't be fresh or hire a personal chef.But if you're looking for pretty good chilli crab at a LIVE seafood restaurant in a nice setting in a touristy area that is busy and has high turnover of food, then, this is the place for you.We ordered salted egg prawns, stuffed fried beancurd and chilli crab. We'd previously had the pepper crab at Long Beach but wanted to try the signature dish and was tempted to walk in after seeing people in the restaurant digging in.We walked up at 5:30pm and were seated promptly, but were advised walk-ins normally have to make a reservation or wait because it usually gets crowded. We had the table until 7:00pm which I am guessing is their next seating time. Keep this in mind so you don't get there at 6:15 and have only 45 minutes.If you reserve you can get seated by the river, but the inside seating has it's own benefits of air conditioning.Service was prompt and friendly. We were given a bib and we saw some people being given disposable gloves to wear when eating the crab.If you have a handbag they will offer you a chair cover to hide it under so it doesn't get any food on it and it keeps your belongings safe too.The salted egg prawns was everything i love about egg yolks. Creamy, rich sauce covering sweet prawns.The stuffed beancurd could be given a miss next time, it was a bit bland but understand it's how it's supposed to taste.But the chilli crab came out hot in a pan/pot, covered in a delicious sauce that wasn't too sweet, it didn't taste overly like ketchup as ones I've tasted in the past have, and the meat was juicy. For two people, you'll get a crab about 1.1lgs for SG$78 a kg.Now, if you think you can get much cheaper LIVE MUD CRAB 'back home', I'd love to know where 'back home' is, because back home in Sydney AU$90+ a kilo is what you'll look at paying for something that was alive and cooked, not frozen.Remember, the restaurant is popular, it's the location, it's the food, lots of tourists and locals want to dine there every day, so yes, if you go at peak hour, the service most probably won't be absolutely exclusive. This is not a 5 star hotel or michelin restaurant.So be realistic about what you'll be paying, and just enjoy the atmosphere over the river on a balmy nigh
4
You often have to queue for this place. Be prepared to share a table which can be fun and you will get a table faster at busy times.My husband had the chilli crab which is huge which he said was good.I had cod pieces on batter with a wonderful sauce.Noisy, buzzy place - food comes when it is cooked so just eat what ever comes out in whatever order
1
My Wife and I were eagerly waiting to have our favourite Black Pepper Crab and Singapore Chilli Prawns that we usually have at east Coast seafood to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.How disappointing that Jumbo's for some unfathomable reason DONT do Singapore chilli Prawns ...So we had a quite small Crab ( as we were not asked what size Crab) Some average fried rice and had to settle on "Szechuan style" prawns Plus we had to ask for cutlery and Service was generally ordinaryThink long and hard before going to this hyped up expensive restauran
2
I was thoroughly disappointed in Jumbo Seafood Riverside, it is not at all comparable to the East Coast location. First of all - the service is a joke, amateur like. The poor waitress had no idea of what she was doing. Second the food was mediocre. This is the home of the chilli crab - I don't think so. The sauce is too sweet and is void of any heat. The crab mushy - no not a good performance at all
4
We went to Jumbo as it was listed one of top places to try chilli crab and it did not disappoint. While we did prefer the lemon pepper crab the sauce of the chilli crab is absolutely divine. Order some mini bread to dip the bread into the sauce and it's delicious.
5
Jumbo Seafood Restaurant is very well known for its chilli crab menu. We went there for family lunch. We made the reservation and chose the set menu online about 10 days ahead. They confirm our reservation by email. The set menu we chose is for 4-5 persons. It's cost 400 $. We had 6 dishes :- Chilli Crab, Steamed Lobster, Shark Fin Soup, Fried Rice with Seafood in XO Sauce, Abalone& Spinach Fried in Oyster Sauce and Dessert. This branch is called Clarke Quay Branch. It's not so crowded and rather quiet. Most customer are small group of friends or family. This restaurant is recommended for Chinese style dishes
5
It was first time.
And i'll go someday to eat again.
The scenery along the river. make me happy all the meals.
4
Get your number and wait for a table, you won't get dissappointed!
Order the big crab (not the pepper one) & some other side dishes. Sit outside near the river, enjoy the food, the view & atmosphere.
5
The taste is good and the price is suitable for the main food. But paying the price every single food (such as tea ...)
5
This place is amazing, the chili crab and pepper crab are great dishes making Jumbo a value added to any visitor coming to Singapore
4
Extremely well located, fast service and open till late in evening, Jumbo Seafood Riverside surely is a good choice for travellers... Food quality is also quite impressive... But the prices are on a higher side ... Toilet is a bit unclean and needs attention.
5
This is the second time I visit Jumbo, it didn't disappoint me. I tried both black pepper crab and chilli crab, both are very delicious and bit spicy, they used mug crab so very " meaty", the chilli crab came with more sauce so you can order the fried buns or rice. I personally like black pepper one better, it's more traditional and representative. The fried bun is amazing , outside crunchy and inside soft. Every time I come Singapore this is a must to visit place
3
If you are at Clarke Quay and don't know which outlet to go, I suggest Riverwalk instead of Riverside Point. Because this place is quite small.We went on a Wednesday noon and thought there'll be no crowd hence we didn't made any reservation. In the end, we have to share a table with a group of strangers. As we were using hands to eat crabs, I would prefer to face someone I know instead of strangers. Unable to really enjoy if you're eating self consciously.We ordered chilli crab, fried buns, kang kong and salted egg prawns. The food is good except for the salted egg prawns. After eating just 2 pieces, it get satiated
3
We were recommended this restaurant by a local taxi driver. We did not have reservations ahead of time, so that put an obstacle in our path. When we tried to get in to the restaurant we had to stand in line for quite a while just to book in, and you had to have a mobile phone in order to place your name in the queue. From being out of town and only having a phone that did not work in Singapore, this created a dilemma.Eventually, after sitting outside the restaurant on chairs provided for about 30 minutes, we got called to our table, but because of the demand on tables, there was a sign on our table saying we had to leave in I think it was 1 hour. I had never seem that restriction before.The food was OK, but expensive. We did not order the chili crab, but had fried rice and a prawn stir fry. Nothing to get excited about.The staff were so rushed and anxious to get as many people in as they could, and out as fast as they could, that I can't say that I had an enjoyable time
5
You will need a reservation and reserve the large crab at the same time. They have daily delivery and if you call 1 or 2 days in advance, you can request for large crab i.e 1.3 - 1.5 kg. You have to be ready to eat with all your figures as it is quite messy but they provide you an apron. There are choices of indoor or outdoor tables.Famous for their Chilli crab, and you should have some fried buns to dip into the sauce! We also had the pepper crab, spinach tofu, salted egg prawns, a whole crispy chicken, salted fish fried rice and some vegetables. Food is delicious, 9 of us came to a total of S$504, so it is not a cheap restaurant
1
Went there for a couple's dinner out.The food was alright but way too expensive for the quality. The crabs were pre cooked. Got it served within 5 min of order. The sauce was already room temperature. I can get the same stuff for half the price at China town.The service was..... horrible!!After we got the Chilli crab (pre- cooked), we had to wait over 20 minutes for the drinks and rice... We were 2 and they only gave us 1 set of cracker. Asked for another set and had to wait 10 min for that as well.As for the steamed buns ordered with the crab, they never came... Tried to cancel after 30-40 min and was given a huge attitude from the waitress.When I thought that hit the bottom, just as we were about to leave, I saw the 2 waitresses eating a leftover desserts right in front of the kitchen. Came on girls....at least hide...Overall, it was one of the worst experience I had. If this was at KFC or Mac, I would not give a dam. Remember that people are playing the premium for the location and SERVICE
4
Great crab. I think this is the main reason to come here. Price is high, and its a total tourist trap given the location, but it's good!
3
The food is good but normal.
Very good located.
There are no surprises but is incredibly expensive for what it offers.
4
Service was average (with some very courteous waiters/waitresses, but some of them were very impatient)
5
If you are a food lover and want to be in the most happening place then Jumbo Seafood is the place to be.
5
On every visit to Singapore I have to pop into this restaurant for their Chili Crab and Pepper Crab , the best in the World , I really don't care about their other items on the menu .
3
The location is right next to the Singapore River. We were there at 5pm and it is beautiful and romantic for sunset dinner. I reccomend the chilli crab, black pepper crab and steam black cod fish. The crab and fish are so fresh!! Service however, was so bad to almost rude. They seem not willing to explain the difference of all the different crabs they have. Also worth to note there will be two seating time: we were asked to finish by 7pm, for the next seating. Meaning we only have 45min to one hour to eat the delicous seafood. Overall, it is still one of the best out there in Singapore.We stayed in Novotel, so it is like 5 minutes walk only to all the attraction in clarke quay
3
As locals, we normally prefer the heartland stir fry "coffee shops" and we came here because we had redeemed a voucher to use up.The service is very good as the associates are very attentive, topping up your tea, asking if you need any help ever so often. This was even as the restaurant was at its busiest around noon.We realize that it is best to book ahead (and we did) in order to sit in the interior where the air conditioning cools you. Those that came without reservations had to share a large table if they wanted to dine indoors. Usual etiquette is to hold your table for 15 minutes after the booked timeslot.Pricing-wise, it cannot beat the heartland equivalents but it would be an excellent introduction to visitors and prices are transparent. Just remember to ask if you are not sure.Obviously the signature dishes are its stir fried chilli and pepper crabs. For the chilli crab, the small fried buns ("mantou") is a good complement. While for pepper crab, it is best downed with fried rice. Good range of choice for those who are not too in love with crabs
5
i have been to a jumbo outlet previously but not this particular branch so i was half expecting much of the same ol, same ol. when we were told that the waiting time was going to be something between 45 minutes to an hour, i feared my night was going to be ruined.but with queue control efficiency and good company meant that time flew when we were ushered to our table 5 minutes shy of an hour. as we had late lunch earlier, everyone opted for simple dishes just to be on the safe side. the food was superb & the location by the riverside just brings out the character of the restaurant.i wish i could say more but food hunting in singapore is always going to be a struggle as almost every eatery on the island republic is nice, so sometimes its hard to tell which restaurant is better than the other.jumbo has always had a strong tradition of serving delicious food at not so affordable prices, and with a full house almost every other night, one will be forgiven to try out other eateries for a change, but jumbo is something that needs to be experienced at least once & if you think it's too common a food place, then feel free to sample the other hundreds of places to eat in the island. but for me, dining in a jumbo is something i look forward to when visiting the island republic

Pros : 1. We got a table without reservation on a sunday night. The system to get a token is pretty good and organised. 2. Portions were generous. 3. The preparation was quite well balanced. The crab meat was fresh. We ordered the Chilli crab. Cons: 1. Language was a big problem - our server wasn't well versed with English so placing the order took quite a bit of time and effort. 2. The reservation staff seemed over worked and were bordering on rude and seemed inefficient. Not the best first experience of a restaurant. 3. The table didn't have cutlery organised even after food arrived. 4. We got the seating inside and not by the river. Its very cramped inside. We are politely asked to shift a little in the middle of our meal as the table adjacent to us wanted to be seated. I hate being interrupted in between my meals! Conclusion : I think Jumbo is a hype! Some locals that I got chatting with told me that there were other places that serve way better food and Jumbo has great location so its better in the eyes of most visitors! Its worth a visit but next time Im in Singapore I'll be looking for a different Chilli crab experience
3
Got there for dinner, rather busy evening. Eventually got a table inside, had to wait far too long for the drinks order. The table next to us came in after us and got their food before us and whilst they were having their pudding we finally got our meal. Had to keep asking the staff for the food. It was rather chaotic service. But the cereal prawns were very tasty as well as the chilli crab
3
After hearing rave reviews for the chilli crab from Singapore expats you can imagine our disappointment on not being able to get a table at any point over the weekend we were around Clarke Quay
A simple moral; book early, dine later. We will return
5
Food is good. at least this time do not feel being rush out to cater to waiting customer. Last time the waitress was like do you want your bill...so did not like the place..but the recent one was so much better.
3
For tourists who want to try the famous local dish but do not want to be picked off, this is a reasonable option.

I've written quite a few reviews for Tripadvisor and this will sadly be the first that is not positive.If all you're only thinking of going to Jumbo Seafood for their is signature dish of Chilli Crab and you're not too cost conscious then you probably won't be disappointed. So don't read on.We'd seen the glowing write ups in the guide books for this place and the four of us were looking forward to a special treat. We wanted to go Saturday evening so tried to reserve a table in advance but the phone wasn't answered. So we decided to risk it. It's a great walk from Clarke Quay Metro through loads of heaving restaurants and bars to the lovely riverside and we had no difficulty finding Jumbo. We arrived about 21:30 and the advertised waiting time on their automated booking system was 90 minutes. However, there seemed to be a rapid turnover so we put in our details (Tip: you need a local phone number to do this) and went off elsewhere for a drink. We got summoned back within 20 minutes - possibly because we had indicated we were willing to share a table and a table for eight had come up.Two of us knew we wanted the famous Chilli Crab (no price indicated on the menu) and the other two didn't. So we ordered two crab, one seafood fried rice and one steamed (I think) whole Grouper. We also had a beer and (free) tea. The order-taking was a bit off-hand but we put that down to a busy Saturday evening. The dishes arrived separately with appreciable gaps in between. So one of us was waiting with a dish of crab while the other three had nothing - and so on for about 10 minutes.The two of us with crab agreed that our food was delicious and plentiful. The other two thought their food was pretty awful. The rice dish was the blandest thing we had ever seen - like something you might feed a four year-old child. And the Grouper was all but inedible in it's rubberyness. Either it had not been properly cooked or it had died of old age.When we came to pay the bill the quarter-eaten fish and rice dishes were discussed with what appeared to be a manager but no sympathy and certainly no recompense were offered.Apart from agreeing that this is a great riverside location and we would never go there again; we reflected that the establishment is probably resting on its crab laurels and needs to recognise that customers also eat other things. The Chilli Crab portions are pretty big - the three people sharing our table had one serving between them. Probably two people per serving would be adequate. And eating Chilly Crab is a very messy business. We noticed before we left that the cognoscenti wore bibs and that plastic gloves were available. But neither of those were offered to us.The bill for this sad experience was 334 Singapore Dollars including 10% service charge and 7% GST (£190; US$247; €218). The two crab dishes together were 140 SD; the rice dish was a snip at 18 SD; and the rubber Grouper was a shocker at 108 SD. I thought we were getting free bowls of nuts while we were waiting but these came in at 1.20 SD.We had a lovely walk back through the crowds on a balmy Singapore late evening

Each time I go back to visit Singapore, I go back to Jumbo Seafood Restaurant for Chilli and Pepper Crabs. It never fails to disappoint in terms of taste. All the other dishes we ordered were also very nice. However, I would have given them a higher rating if the crabs did not come an hour and a half later instead of the 40 minutes wait they said.
4
Very busy we were told. We were offered to share a table outside with another group as the restaurant was fully booked for the next few days. We went for a walk and when came back were told that no tables left! We insisted and they let us have lunch on a shared table. Didn't look like the staff wanted more customers! To be honest there were some empty tables and when we looked inside (they were kinda trying to not let us even go inside!!) there were more empty tables inside which surprised us. Other than that, the food was great. Service was reasonably quick and friendly. Overall experience was good and I would go back next time around.

My boyfriend and I went to this restaurant because we saw the good rating on Tripadvisor and because we saw it on our guide. So, we had to wait in line for one hour in order to get seated without any kindness from the staff at the entrance (they seemed even fruastrated to have all this people willing to eat at their restaurant: when I asked for something to them, they didn't answer me o answered in a rude way). When we finally set, also the waiters seemed to not be interested in serving us properly and professionally. The food was good and tasty (we ordered chilli crab, the traditional plate) and a little expensive even considering that we were dining along the riverwalk in Singapore. Even getting the bill was hard since the waiter seemed to intentionally avoid to get in touch with the customers.

@TheKuoKnowsJumbo and its closest Singapore rival, Long Beach, are almost indistinguishable. I say "almost" because connoisseur Chilli Crab-eaters will claim there are discernible differences between the two.Booking is highly recommended, especially at the weekends. The signature Chilli Crab is a must. So too are the Man Tou to mop up the chilli sauce. In the good old days, diners would make do with a generous plate of bread that cost next to nothing. These days, its Man Tou.The Cereal Prawns are definity worth a try. The marriage of the oats, garlic and curry-powder coating on individually deep-fried prawns makes for an interesting contrast to the crab. A plate of stir-fried vegetables is a must.Jumbo does a lot of things right. But it also gets some things wrong.A restaurant is a place place where food is meant to be enjoyed. It is not a food factory where meals are pushed out from the kitchen to the table in double quick time. Slow down. It's not always about return on equity. It's about getting customers to return for the repeat business
4
We got it in the Lonely Planet and Tripadvisor. Long line (but You can reserve a table on line).Very good location: in Clarke Quay.No prices for the crab in the menu: You have to ask. For a 1.1 kg chili crab, rice and 1 L of Evian we paid 115 SGD. Not so different from the others in the Quay
3
We have tried this place to eat the famous crab and at the end we are happy about it, but not happy about the service. The lady in charge of the drink was really noisy and put a lot of pressure to order, and at the end we order a jug of beer and in the bill we pay 4 glasses of beer. We inform about the mistake... everyone disappeard... When we sit down they bring us some tea and peanuts... so supposed to be like appetizer... but when you check the bill they put it, so you have to pay... really not fair... last... we went to the bathroom and we find a nice guest, so again... they even not clean and check the bathroom..

I could enjoy Jumbo seafood very well. It was great and the service was impressive as well.
Thank you.
It was my 2nd visit and the service actually improved compared to several years ago.
4
There was a line in front of the place. We thought that it may take long time to get there. However I got SMS with invitation just 2 min after I placed booking using their online booking system. The restaurant was full and their award winning chilly crab was superb! The restaurant interior is not something you will remember for years. I'd also prefer to have more attention from the waiting staff. However taking into account enormous amount of visitors, they've been doing well
5
The food : Really deliciousThe service : KindI already know it is popular, so I booked it one month earlier. And I can enter there right away but I can only use just one hour for next customer. That's why I can not fully enjoy Jumbo's food.But I like all dishes and I'd like to go there again
4
Part of an after-work get together, Jumbo was a great deal of fun for a large group. Had a chance to try Chilli and pepper crab which is both are tasty. Food is served family style so dig in and prepare to get messy. The small buns are perfect to soak up the sauce from the chilli crap
1
My wife and I arrived in Singapore from Thailand on the next leg of our 3 week honeymoon around South East Asia. As a huge seafood fan, my wife had arranged to stop at Jumbo Seafood for diner straight from the airport and en route to our hotel.I can honestly say this was the worst dining experience of my life and a terrible first impression of Singapore. The service was abysmal and the staff were rude. We waited over an hour for a dish which never came and was eventually cancelled. When we asked for the bill, it was thrown on the table without a hint of apology. This is a stark contrast to the outstanding customer service we received in Thailand.Do not come here. The waiting staff are detestable and the food is vastly overpriced
3
We ordered the much talked about chilli crab and mee goreng. Mee goreng was served first, it was sweet-and-sour to taste and the noodles were not dry. Chilli crab was served next. We found that the gravy was not spicy, in fact it was sweet and slightly sour, giving us the idea that the same gravy was probably used for the mee goreng. The steamed garlic prawns were overcooked and I suggest to give it a miss. If you are not for spicy food, this would be a good choice in the city. Please do remember to ask for the price of the crab per kg and request for it to be under one kg if there are only two of you.
4
It seems they are not good about serving but the crab is worth. I liked the area and loved their special crab. A little expensive for what they give you, but thinking about Singapore they have reasonable prices. Don't sit inside, you will smell crap! We asked for outdoor seats which made our dinner better
4
My son's friend recommended this when we wanted to find a special seafood restaurant here in Singapore. We were not disappointed. The chili king crab was not exactly king size but it was so good. The prawns were not far behind either and so was almost everything we ordered. We played it safe and picked the group menu for 6. After taxes the bill was a little over SGD 400. You can go to a well reviewed hotel buffet with that but I doubt if they would have the kind of sea food you'll find here
4
Had a late lunch here, and sat outside, which is much better than the rather close table formation inside. The menu is extensive and there are many really great seafood dishes. I had scallops in XO sauce - really excellent, a Grouper, steamed with a soya sauce, also excellent and chill crab. The latter was good, but I have had a lot better in Boat Quay. It is not a negative, because it was still good. Its quite pricey, but I did enjoy. Evenings are really busy, and expect a 45 min wait as walk-in. I tried the night before and couldn't be bothered to wait that long, so thus I went for lunch the next day
5
We waited in the rain for about 1 hour which made me wonder why we were being so silly when there were plenty of other places to eat (like the place a few shops down that has robot waiters)!We finally were seated in what was some Lord of The Flies survival mission of taking a paper ticket that seemed to be about as useful as a piece of big roll (thanks to the Chinese who simply believe they can all rudely push to the front of the queue and not wait like everyone else).The chili crab and pepper crab we had was amazing and there is a good reason they give you the paper bib to wear - it gets very messy. Jumbos is a must try foodie stop. Be sure to walk along the river after as it is a pleasant stroll.
4
Surprised to see good pure vegetarian food options in Singapore and that too in popular sea food restaurant.
Had awesome dinning expiriance with colleagues.
4
I was going there with my friends, and we decide to choose "chili crab" as our food. For the spicy lovers will like this food so much !!
One portion is enough for 4 persons.
5
We had a good and best taste sea food (Curry Crab) in Jumbo seafood restaurant. Before you plan to come to Jumbo remember to book the table first.
1
staff was unkind. chilly crab was terrible than i thought. i never go to the jumbo restaurant again.
2
It's not worth what you pay. We sit so close to another table. It's like we had dinner with them. The food is good. But nothing special.
5
Its a tourist " hot spot" its busy, its noisy. BUT if you want to taste real Singapore Chilli Crab conveniently there is nothing that comes close!
2
Most over rated restaurant in Singapore why people get there early to get in is beyond me. We got there early to get in early but it was not organised that well. We had to share another table with some other people and we were seated first but our orders were taken last. When we left the bill was extremely high and one of the head waiters was rude. I wouldn't go back even if I had a free meal. thumbs down from u
5
The food was great. The best crab I've ever had . Some suggestions: try to go early or make a reservation. Walk in at 7pm is 60 min wait. Get lots of buns or ask for steamed rice. The sauce the grabs are in is amazing so you will need something besides a spoon :-)
5
Came here for dinner one night without reservation. Waited for about half an hour before we got a table. Food was excellent. Especially the black pepper crab. A must try if you like seafood. I am not too crazy about crab but I art about half of the crab. The crab is a little under 1kg. Crab is what the restaurant famous for. Their waiting system is pretty sophisticated. You enter your mobile number and the number of people. It will then send you an SMS with the reservation number. It has a board showing what number it is serving also they will send you an SMS if your turn is up. But I suggest you call ahead and make a reservation before you go
4
It seems half of Singapore come here for their chilli crab which is always excellent. Two evening sittings can mean you feel a little rushed so make sure you are on time and always hook ahead. We have been here multiple times and look forward to dining here again when we next return to SG
4
I think it is a right place to have very good and delicious seafood. All of the items were good and service staffs also are very friendly.
5
Best place to eat seafood with amazing chili crab with delicious bun. The price not really expensive
4
The chilli crab tastes sweet more than spicy, and the cornmeal shrimp is too sweet, after all, the service is good, you need book the reservation before many days, otherwise, you could be wait for long time.
2
Sir, I hope that you will read this comment and adjust your commercial upsell strategy, a bit miserable. We went 5 dining at your restaurant. I'll not mention the lack of prices display on the menu, neiter the fact that the crab cost $75 for 800grs that we can't verify anyway... no no.. I want to talk about the fact that your staff brings on the table silently some pinuts, and propose hot tea just after we ordered drinks.... forgeting to mention that it is chargeable.So it's not for the few extra dollars that I take the time to write this review, but just to raise a question: are you facing financials issues? Do you need help, money speaking? What restaurant in the world can have such low attitude to put pinuts, normally a commercial gesture when the guests order drinks,... and add it in the bill?May be if it helps, I can send you a few kilos of pinuts to your restaurant, please feel free to let me know
4
The front desk staff were friendly n allotted us a table on the second floor which was cosy n private. The waitress were very friendly n cheerful m the seafood was fresh. We did have to ask several times for our tea cups to be topped up but this is only a minor hiccup.
4
Highly recommend it! The crab was delicious as was the bamboo clams. Everything was well seasoned and presented very well. Only downside is the ambience - it's loud and busy and often hard to get old of wait staff and on occasion this leads to the staff placing the order incorrectly. But the food really is delicious and reasonable. Crab curry is wonderful
2
The food was good. However, when the person brought the peanuts, we declined it and we were still charged for the peanuts. We also asked the server if any of the food we ordered had peanuts in it since one of us was allergic to peanuts. He (who took our order) said no. After the food was brought to the table, one of us had an allergic reaction so we asked someone else if there was peanuts and they said yes. We were very dissappinted for the people at the restaurant. Jumbo is a well known restaurant and the food is great. The restaurant clearly though, needs to work on development of the employees
4
I quite often eat at this place. The chilly crab is fantastic.. We ate it with fried bun. The meat of the crab is so fresh and tasty. The lobster sashimi was very good. First time I ate raw lobster, the meat is like jelly and when we combine it with light sauce and wasabi is very tasty in our mouth. The view also very good because is next to Singapore River.. Good place to have dinner.
5
We booked in advance for a dinner at Clake Quay Jumbo restaurant, then we were served immediatly wgeb arriver here by professional staffs. The plus point at this restaurant is the beautiful view at the riverside at night. We order one small chilli crab for 2 peson for trying before deciding to get more, and we were so surprised about how big the dish are, it is full for us without any additional one. Then we couldn't finish the whole dish and got to pack off to take the rest home. This is the best dish we had in Singapore and we hope to come back soon to try again, of course at Jumbo restaurant
5
If you really want to feel as if you have truly arrived in Singapore you must try the Chilli Crab at Jumbo! It is sensational. You must book a table. Very fresh mud crab cooked while you wait in a delicious sauce. Takes 30 min. However forget the other rather meagre unappetising dishes that are also on the menu. They were served before the crab, even though we said we wanted to all eat together. Cab fare was $15 from the City Centre.
5
We are team building including 24 people. Sent email to book 2 tables . The service was good and the food were delicious!
4
It would have been better if I spoke English better. The atmosphere was good and the food tasteless:)
3
Doesnt respect customer, while i was talking, he kept on walking without even looking at us, does not speak clearly, and pretended to not listen to customers!!! After a few calls (5) then he reached out to us disrespectfully!!!
4
Well there are many of good seafood restaurent, Jumgo sure one of them.
I recently do not go there since it looks too busy, crowded for tourist.
It does not mean they are not good.
4
10/10 for the chilli crab (best dining experience albeit not cheap)
6/10 overall service. One nice waitress, waiter and other waitress rude considering you spend a load of cash ;)
5
I ate very delicious chili crab and see at night on the terrace. It ate fried rice dish and beer that sauce is fantastic.
4
Chilli crab & seafood fried rice are the best. We love it. But beers are expensive!
The staff are OK & helpful. And nice view that you can enjoy your time
5
Very great taste and services.I love chilli crab and next time I will try black pepper crab. Very good services
4
been to jumbo many times over the years but never made reservation myself. called to make reservation a few days in advance for weekend family dinner and got sms confirmation right away very efficient and glad i did as it was soooo packed when we got there.we ordered chili crab and pepper crab. chili crab was best amongst the other few famous crab places. the sauce was spicy and tangy which paired perfect with the deep fried bun we scrapped the pot clean! crab was big and fat.black pepper crab was equally good, hot but flavorful. crab again was fresh and big but our didnt have crab roe so was a bit disappointed as it was my favorite part.we also ordered their signature oat prawn which was crispy we even ate the shell. the scallop wrapped with yam which was nice filling dish but scallop slight overcook. the seaweed fish tofu was another must order dish, silky tofu that punch with flavor.among the other crab places i visited this week with family, jumbo definitely keep up their quality and consistently deliver good food even the place is so popular.....will definiely come back again

We had lunch at Jumbos Clarke Quay on Friday 15 th July whilst we were in Singapore last week. We arrived just after they had opened for lunch. We didn't book but we're lucky to get a good table inside as the restaurant was very busy. The table service was very efficient and not long after we were seated we had the menu, ordered drinks and were offered peanuts to nibble. We didn't take long to decide on the Chilli Crab for two. With our bibs firmly in place we eagerly waited for the food to arrive, and it didn't disappoint. The crab was delicious and the sauce just right. The hot buns helped to get the last of the sauce. The table service continued to be very good and plates of crab shell were efficiently removed. The finger bowls and wet wipes very handy when we had finished. The bill came as soon as we had requested it. This is the second time we have been to Jumbos at Clarke Quay, and on both times the food has been of a very high standard and we have throughly enjoyed our meals and each time left with a smile on our face
5
Good view, SIngapore Strait, very big Crab from Siri Lanke Sea, very very good taste, we have tried Chilli Crab and black pepper Crab, I am really enjoying it.
2
For all these years of eating at Jumbo, the quality of the crabs have definitely fallen to the extent that you can taste the crab flesh is not fresh and it was warmed up rather than freshly cooked. It was such a shock!
5
all of stafs are kind! i think that a man looks like a manager who can speak Korean is very kind. We were very happy. We will visit there again! Thanks.
3
Visited the restaurant mid week with a large group. Was lucky to have a private room which great given how busy the main restaurant was. A great set of appetizers was followed by both curried crab and peppered crab entrees. The restaurant was unable to provide large crabs (> 1.5kg) but compensated by giving us more smaller crabs. I had a preference for the peppered crab, but I have to confess the curry sauce that went with the other crab dish was delicious.A fun location to eat - everyone looked in the part wearing there disposable 'jumbo' bibs
2
We went to jumbo to have the best chilli crab inn town. We also had a pepper crab and a bottel of white wine. This was our first visit at jumbo.The crab was great! But the service was bad, we had to wait for a long time before we voud order, and when we had questions the waiter didn't even answer properly. We had the feeling that jumbo lives on it's good reputation, and maybe lost it's self under the way. It's like a big fabric that just needs the customer to go inn, give them food, and get them fast out again. A restaurant without soul. But the crab was fantastic
4
Our friends took us here and not surprisingly, the place was fairly busy being on a tourist location.Chilli crabs are usually on the table, but not for us tonight. We were given bibs though.We sat indoors, out of the heat, but outdoor seating is available along the river.No complaints about the food or service.If you have a 6pm reservation, be prepared to vacate your table by 745pm so they can get ready for the next sitting
4
A friend said, "oh you must go to Jumbo's for the chili crab" so we took the MRT to Clarke Quay and gave it a try. the good news is that the setting on the water is very pleasant on a warm evening, and the food was very good. Unfortunately, we did not think to ask what the "Market Price" was and were somewhat astounded that the bill came to $228 for two people, including $70 for each crab. Nice, but..
4
We ordered the chilli crab, fried rice and prawn in pumpkin mash. The waitress for our order wrong as we wanted the wok fried prawns and when we tried to order coconut juice, they didn't have it which was a bit disappointing. Service could be improved but food was so delicious. The famous chilli crab lived up to its expectation although it was quite sweet which I didn't expect. Overall a must try when in Singapore.
3
Pepper Crab prepared taste better than Chilli one. The fish was small and expensive. The meat of the whole chicken was too dry to eat. Pumpkin sauce prawn is quite nice. Broccoli was not soft enough for me. Coconut meat was too hard to be edible.
3
We thought this would be a bit cheaper than the MBS restaurants and we wanted fresh fish and vegetablesFor two full fish two small plates of vegetables and 3 Bowls of rice and 3 drinks. One beer two soft it cost us $174 sWe had to line up and started at 5.30 and be out by 6.45 p.m for the next batch of diners. It had a nice location by the river with boats going byBut they charge for the fish by weight. Who knows if it really weighs what they claim. I doubt it. Our fish looked like 700 grams but we paid for a kilo.I'd still return as all the food was goodThe sauce on my fish was one of the best sauces I've ever eaten. I used it for the ric
5
Reasonable pricing, exotic seafood, wonderful location!
THE place to enjoy a wonderful dinner by the quay!
5
Had preferred Jumbo East Coast but it is not open for lunch. The next best option was Jumbo riverside for it's sight and convenience. Great food, great ambience.
4
Great taste chili crab! One of the best and you should not miss it when you visit Clark quay.
Long que and you need to book in advance.
4
prompt service and good food. slight hitch in English language understanding and conversation of waiters and waitresses

We have been recommending Jumbo Seaford, Riverside for many years to any friends going to Singapore. However, our last visit with our daughter and her family, was the most dreadful dinner we had ever had there (and we have been coming there for many years). Ranging from the Service; unfriendly waiters, Food; the crab lacked its usual freshness and when we tried to order anything other than the signature dish of Chilli Crab, we were almost discouraged by waiters. We left wondering if we would ever come back again, however, as we had already pre-booked another dinner for 3 nights later, we decided to chance it again.  And it was most definitely the right decision: everything was back to the usual standard: great crab (fresh) both chilli & ginger with shallots, and staff were friendly again. So, we will keep on recommending it and coming back again ourselves. However, I do believe Jumbo Seafood needs to be very conscious that their growth/success is not at the expense of their customers and the quality of their produce. We found out also, during our stay, that other guests from our hotel had also had bad experiences at Jumbo Seafood, which is quite sad, given Jumboâ€™s past reputation.
5
An institution and always busy. Make sure you reserve. What to have? Chill crab, black pepper crab, cereal prawns. Pretty much everything is good. It's always busy and always loud. Service is good, including the Tiger Beer ladies. A real experience and not to be missed - not a tourist trap, most of the diners are locals
4
Every time I pop in to Singaporte, I book a dinner in this restaurant. A bit crowded and risk to arrive and it's full. That's why resrvation is strongly recommended. Definitively it's a place to taste the superbe black pepper crab. I tried it in other ways but it's worth dead is with pepper. Good value for money. Then, let's go on with a nice walk on clark quey
4
Possibly the best known chain for seafood in Singapore with 4 outlets. I went to riverside point Clarke quay and so the location is great. They have been snide and outside seating and you would be lucky to get a place in which is first come first serve Anyway chilli crab is the speciality which you must try and that involves a little bit if dexterity. You also lose some calories while eating. The menu is not about crab it s quite elaborate to leave you with a satisfied tummy. Service is efficient and courteous
4
Been always wanted to try chilli crab to taste how special this dish until become one of the famous food in Singapore. It turned out great. Reached there for lunch. Got our table right away. Service is pretty good. Not too long waiting time for the food to be served. Must try the chilli crab with fried mantao. Ordered a small portion of fried rice to eat with the chilli crab sauce. The portion is good enough for 2 to 3 persons. The restaurant ambience is nice enough for this meal in the hot afternoon.
3
Went there for dinner with some friends from out of town who wanted to try the famous Jumbo Seafood. It delivered what it promised at a tourist price ! Good place to go once in a while, but other local options for the more frequent visit
5
the waiters were nice and at ur hand while needed. the seafood was great. the location was near the singapore river side, and the atmosphere was great.
3
The reservation system is automated....sends an sms when your table is available....
The food is good but too close to fast food for me...when seated your actually told what time you need to vacate the table...adding to the fast food type of experience.
5
We enjoyed an amazing meal here with our boys. The chilli crab was fantastic. The service was very impressive and the quality of food for the four of us was extremely good. Will definitely dine here again
5
We like this place and their food so much that we organised a stopover in Singapore on or way home from Saigon to Perth, Australia. The stopover was so that we could go to Jumbo Seafood. It's exquisite in every way.
5
everything was perfect except the restroom. it was a little bit dirty but it could not be a problem.
crab was very soft and the sauce (we have chilly and black pepper) was excellent!
4
If you are prepared to share a table, you have a chance of getting in sooner but the waiting times no matter when you show up are usually 60-90 minutes. We even tried to make reservations through the week but they always told us reservations only available after 9:45 pm. That being said, they make a good chili crab although they did not have sri lanka crabs they did use mud crabs (which are about 1kg ~ $79 Singaporean dollars). We found the crab was in a sweet/spicy sauce and you need the little deep fried buns to soak up the ample sauce. We also had a deep fried squid dish which was surprisingly crunchy and intense with squid flavour. The water spinach prepped in garlic was our green dish and was also very good
5
My husband and twin girls who are nine years old ate there yesterday, and it was fantastic. We ordered the chilli crab and we all loved it. The service was very friendly, and were wonderful with the children. We had a great night out and will remember long after we return to Adelaide in south Australia. We sat at a table overlooking the river. It was very busy, so make a booking if you can. We had to wait for 60 minutes for s table, and glad we did.
3
After a 45 minute wait during which time we thought we were waiting on a riverside table (oops!) we were shown to the crowded back room. So if we'd booked and sat by the riverside we'd probably have enjoyed it way better (although the food is average). The food was okay, the service was okay but if it is great food you are after then there are many many other places in less scenic locations. for far less $$. We had at Jumbo the Dragon Fruit and lobster entree, $18.00. Quarter of a dragon fruit, 4 pieces of lobsterish meat soaked in a mayonnaise. The green vegetables in garlic were absolutely delicious! The horfan noodles and seafood were sloppy and cold as they had sat on the serving bench for 15 minutes while the busy staff were busy elsewhere. Fortunately we have found lots of great food elsewhere. Bugis Street we ate a stunning seafood meal for under $25.00 with attentive service in a lovely cleanarea...but that's for a different review

I have eaten tons of crabs. From dungeness. King. Snow. Mud. Etc you name i tried it. I cant say anything that wow me about this... its boil crab. Put a bottle of sweet chili sauce and a egg..charge an arm and leg... 78sg for kg. And they charge you 800 grams and give you a 500 to 600 gram crab... in short if your a 1st timer to try chilli crab go to hawker place and pay 30sg for it. Same thing. Your not going to taste a huge difference.. if you willing to pay 50sg for better sauce than go ahead and get ripped off. Scallop with taro puff. Any chinese resto can do..6 pc 18 sg..3 people for 101 sg. (70 usd) for 1 crab and 6 scallops and 3 pc of bread.. thats 30 meals in a hawker place..
2
Most staffs were so rude and bad. They kept pushing me to order. I also had only an hour to have dinner even i made a reservation. There was no point of making a booking if i only had 1 hour for dinner sitting. Staffs took my order and it took so long; even for tissues order such a small. Also my card was declined and it worked after. However i have asked them for a minute to double check my card and pay after 5mins, they made me feel like i am not paying any by saying. I love food so i went, but all the services that i had were very disappointing
4
Other than the famous spicy crab, seafood platter and fried rice was also very delicious. The place is always full, must book in advance.
5
The best crab in Singapore love the food there loads of great tasting crab to have and clean and delious in Singapore my son loved this place is favorite crab restraint for sure
3
if you intend to have a good and expensive (and messy) chilli crabs, this might be the place, if you are tourist, this is the place, but local, we will have a bigger crab and larger portion and at 1/2 of the price
5
Enjoy nightlife at Clarke Quay with Jumbo. Their black pepper crab and chili crab were very delicious. We ordered additional bread to eat together with those dishes and everyone was full. Their dried noodle was good too, however, the crab dishes was the key factor.
3
Personally I think it is too expensive, perhaps tourist did not know, they are many fine crabs (chilli crabs) too around in Singapore, using Google and Waze you can easily locate the "chili, hot crabs" .. Singapore is safe and easy and very helpful, Tampines is a good place to eat "cheap and good crabs"And Jumbo charge on the corkcage for wine .. elsewhere is fre
5
Struggling whether to give it 3 stars or 4 stars but Jumbo seafood is really not as bad as many make it out to be. Sure the price is expensive and the wait here can be daunting but with a little bit of planning ahead and an expectation to spend $60-$80 per crab this place is quite all right. The chili crabs are delicious (as judged by me, a possibly misguided foreigner) and the wait can be spent at one of the many bars nearby as they send a text message when the table is ready and wait 5-10 mins for you to arrive if you ask for it. As for the price, it's a meal for an occasion or when hosting visitors anyways and given the location near the circular road this place is worth it
4
Been here last year and this year. Still so good. Nice and helpful staff.Highly recommend the basic chilli crab served with fried mini buns. And the shrimp fried rice is really good, not too oily but still juicy. But i feel like the chilli crab is quite salty that makes me feel thirsty and drank 6 cups of tea in total.Definitely comeback
1
The service:We made a reservation a few days ahead to ensure we could try the famous chili crab. After a long discussion with the receptionist, we were finally able to figure out when they had an opening for us. When we were seated we were given a menu. One menu for the two of us. Okay, I can put up with that. A few minutes later someone came by and took our menu. We had to ask again for a menu so we might actually order our food. After a few minutes someone came by to take our order. We wanted to try the set menu "B" and an order of bamboo clams. We were instructed that they do not have any clams. Interesting, we were the first group of people seated that day. I wonder why someone might not have thought to restock that day. Throughout the meal we had to ask for someone to change our plates or our napkins. This is a rather messy affair and was astounded no one thought to provide additional tissues.The food:Dragon Fruit Starter: Mayonaise, dragon fruit and shrimp. Too plain to be part of a set menu.Fried Rice: Nothing exceptional. I have had this same dish in many other places. Simply too plain to be part of a set menu.Chili Crab: The chili sauce reminded me of sweet chili sauce one might buy in the supermarket. The crab itself had a strong pungent scent about it which immediately turned us off it

I imagine there are cheaper or comparable places to go to get the chili crab, but we happened to find this place online and the idea of enjoying the meal by the river appealed to us. The food was really good. It was definitely on the pricey side, but this wasn't too surprising. Both the chili crab and the black pepper crab were delicious. I would recommend making a reservation. We didn't and happened to get lucky, but the place was definitely packed

I coulnd't make a reservation in advance n just walked-in for dinner at 9pm. Surprisingly, they are nice n attentive. Good service- I would say. And good chilli crab, of course. We are 5 person n our meal is around 260$. Everyone is happy with the crab ^

Jumbo always serves great food, however this outlet is not child-friendly. Staff were inattentive and there was hardly any space inside the restaurant to move around.
5
Excellent food - especially the Chili Crab!
Loved the adult bibs!
Although we didn't have a reservation, the manager agreed to seat us if we wrap up within an hour - we did!

One of the best chilli crabs i have every had. Service was nothing special but yhe crabs were to die for. The tomatoe based sause was delicious had to order more rice so i could eat the sauce.
Highly recommend

Jumbo is my all time favorite seafood restaurant in Singapore. But the service is dropping luckily the food quality still maintain the same. Be prepared to queue for a long time if you don't make reservation early.
4
Great chilli & pepper crab in a bustling location. Maybe not one of the more 'local' neighbourhoods but the food was good, the service obliging & surrounds busy. Bustling is probably the way to describe.
3
some staff not totally friendly at all. They wear recommended the food with the over the guest need just tell the customer that it not enough customer. They post the wrong bill and not correct when customer say. You have to double check when made the payment again
4
Didn't make a reservation but the system was working great on the iPad. Got a phone call pretty soon after that to let us know our table was ready. We had a person that is gluten intolerant, it was a bit tough to explain because some waiters don't speak English. Once we got one of the supervisors to our table, things were taken care off and we got a steamed crab without any sauce. Great taste and happy they took care of the food allergies so everyone could enjoy
5
Great location on the riverside, no reservation, restaurant full, yet got a table for 12 after a couple of drinks in the bar immediately next door. The service and food were both brilliant with shared entrees and mains around a table with a huge lazy susan. I will return

This restaurant was conveniently located close to our accommodation so I planned to have my dose of Chilli crab here. This chain is a license to print money - we arrived at 6.30pm & had to enter our table requirements into a tablet & be allocated a number. You could elect to be notified by SMS or by a display board at the entrance when your number came up! We waited about 20 mins for a non share table for 2. As we were seated (under an awning on the riverside terrace) it started to rain & there was a rapid movement of people, tables & chairs to accommodate all those not under cover. Staff with in-ear communication devices hurried around like an army of ants clearing tables & re-setting in record time. Our orders were taken, we were given paper bibs & our glasses were kept full of hot green tea. My partner is allergic to shell fish so he ordered a chicken dish & I ordered a full chilli crab just for me! Terrifying as price was listed as "seasonal & by weight" so I had no idea how much my dish was going to cost & this was the first place I had encountered with poor communication in english.The chicken dish arrived & rice for 2 came but no chilli crab! I waited 30 mins & as we had been told we had to eat our meal by a certain time, I was getting worried I would not have time to tackle my unknown quantity of chilli crab! We eventually enquired of a waiter & the dish was found. I noticed most other tables shared their dishes amongst at least 2 people so I was in for a feast of delicious crab all to myself while my husband (who had well & truly finished his dish) watched on in amusement. There is no 'nice' way to eat chilli crab w/o becoming covered in the delicious sauce & w/o asking for lots of wet wipes for messy hands & face. The shell-cracker gets slippery & covered in sauce you wipe it on your bib & have another crack & hope the shell doesn't fly off & hit the people at the table next to you (the table is joined to yours because they want to fit as many people in as possible).In the end the crab was good but I can't compare it with anything else as this was my first time! The service was efficient at first but then the delay in my meal arriving was disappointing. I had plenty of time to observe other tables as I waited & picked at my bowl of cold rice! Other tables got all their dishes within minutes of each other. This restaurant seemed to be aimed at Asian tourists & getting as many people fed in an impersonal, robotic way.In the end it cost $70 for my chilli crab which probably weighed about a kilo. The whole night out cost $200 for 2 dishes, plain rice for 2, a couple of beers & a coconut drink. It was convenient but this is fast food - sometimes
5
This was my third time in this restaurant and I have never been disappointed. A bit messy with all the sauce and splitting open the crab claws but very worth it. And what a setting. just opposite Clarks Quay where all the night life is going on and the bridges changing colour like a fibre optic light - brilliant. The river cruise boats all lit up cruising up and down - what a scene
2
Very busy restaurant, but need to eat quickly as they have bookings to follow. Very noisy and food was very average. Poor value for your money . No privacy as tables are so close together. Will not come back.
5
best crab in singapore, order pepper crab is the best. order pot crab curry which comes with lot tasty gravy and buns :)
5
Good and efficient service. We ordered chilli crab, black pepper crab, baby squid, sotong paste you tiao and salted egg prawn. All were yummy!
5
the food was execellent and the servise was good. all the seafood was very fresh and the view of Clarke Quay was impressive. the location is quite conveninent.
5
have dinner here with their signature chilli crab. just like other reviewers said. it's delicious. a bit pricey but I think it's worth the view. We seated next to the river view. just wonderful dinner.

Jumbo restaurant situated at Riverside Point at Clarke Quay in Singapore delivers prompt, courteous and efficient service with mouth-wateringly delicious seafood served with the many Asian flavours that Singapore is famous for.The Chilli crab and Black Pepper Crab are to die for with their luscious spices and flavours wrapped around soft, silky and incredibly fresh succulent crab meat. These are a must have.For those who prefer other seafood the Fried Cod and the Mussels in XO sauce are two more crowd pleasers.We washed these down with their delectable coconut water served still inside the freshly cut coconut. The mango pudding is a delicious way to finish the dinner on a sweet note.Sweet, sour, chilli hot and all the spicy fragrance of exotic Singapore are all present in every dish served by the proud and polite staff of this great establishment.Bookings are essential or you can take a chance and wait at the front of house. Last orders are at 11.15pm

As we didn't mind to share the table with the others, we didn't wait for long even we didn't make any reservation.We were three people and we ordered a red chili crab, a cereal prawns and a spinach tofu. The servers told us we ordered just enough food for three but indeed they're way too much. At the end, we're so full that we were about to explode.I tried the no signboard a couple of years ago and I think they're slightly cheaper than Jumbo (?). I am not quite sure about that though. The cereal prawns were a real bomb and we loved it! If they had a better and nicer toilet, I would give Jumbo a higher score :
1
Everybody said we must try the chili crab from jumbo seafood and we did ! One chili crab, one cot fish, one soup, one beer, for $130 us dollars!!! Yeap $130 for lunch, not a fancy classy lunch nooooo casual seating, normal restaurant. The food was nothing extraordinary just ok. Try to skip this expensive experience because its not worth it at all
4
We returned to Singapore after a long gap and my wife insisted we have the chili crab to check if it was as she remembered it. It certainly was. Personally, I prefer the pepper version but the chili crab is equally good accompanied by chilled Tiger beer. The restaurant in the evening is crowded so advance booking is a must unless you are willing to share. When opting for the share, note that they don't send you an SMS - you need to walk up to the hostesses to be led to your table. For us, that was immediate. Because of the crowd, the service is impersonal but highly efficient - it isn't always quick. And the crab is well worth it as is the other sea food as well. Be prepared to use your fingers however and the aprons are required. When sharing, be prepared that others may not be squeamish but that is probably part of the fun

I went there because it looks good from outside. The queue was quite long to get it. I ordered typical Chilli crab, Black pepper crab and fried rice for 2 persons. We were shocked when seeing the bill. We are not surprised by the price of crabs or fried rice. But we were charged for the cold towel paper and peanut snack before meal. Anyway, it's my lesson learn.After being in Singapore for a year, I found Singaporean style seafood is very unique and good. I have Singaporean Style Seafood in many hawken centers. They are equivalent as good as Jumbo at half or lower price

Delicious Singapore chili crab! Wipe the sauce with their fluffy fried bun, an explosion of flavours that made your mouth sing! My suggestion would be to make sure you make reservations pretty far in advance, cause they got long queue even in weekdays.

The food was absolutely delicious. The seat I sat had a fantastic view which enhanced my experience there. Also the staff was extremely friendly to notch service! Would love to visit here again.

We stopped at this restaurant as it came recommended. Hubby was looking forward to a Singapore Chilli Crab meal.Service- waitress was quite abrupt and unhelpful but what was worse was I observed her being even ruder to other guests.Meals- my meal came out 10 minutes before my husbands so was cold before I could eat it with him.When I asked the waitress she said they came from different kitchens and this was normalWould not recommend.Food OK once we received it
5
I loved it here. Very relaxed and authentic feeling. I felt like I was eating with the locals. We were told this was the best chilli crab in town and I believe it! Our service was great - in fact the crab was so large that we had difficulty cracking the shell so the staff took it back and cracked it for us
4
Have eaten at Jumbos everytime I visit Singapore. It is consistantly good seafood. I always order the black pepper crab which is cooked to perfection evertime. The spicy pepper flavour is great and much preferred to the traditional chilli crab. Evening meals after dark next to the river with a cold beer is a great night out. Highly recommend
5
Strategically located along the Singapore River opposite the Clarke Quay Singapore this riverside restaurant is popular among seafood lovers and tourists plying along Singapore Rivet areas for decent meals.The seafood and vegetables served are fresh and cheaply priced for a decent restaurant there. The grilied sambal stingray fish is their specialty and a fast selling item.Staff are friendly and helpful.Easily accessible by bus, taxi and MRT
5
If you are a lover of all things seafood - a must is any of the Jumbo Seafood - the thing I love - even though I didn't indulge was that the supply you with bibs to eat your Chilli Crabs. A messy eat anytime. I was happy with the fish and all thing "fishy" - I left the Chilli Crab to other. I enjoyed watchin
4
Had the chilli crab which was delicious. It was not too spicy which was good. Ordered the seafood friend rice which was tasty. We have been to Jumbos West Coast previously, abd thought the service there was better. Service was ok but it felt a bit lacking and impersonal for the priceIt is a very messy experience so please be prepared to get dirty! They provide a fabric cover for your bags/items which I thought was a nice thoughtful touch! Ask for additional hand wipes as the water Bowl they supply to rinse your hands in has about 3mls of water in it. There as sinks available to wash hands if neededWe always enjoy jumbo crab when we visit Singapore

Went there at 9pm one evening. Wanted to order the scallop taro box, but sold out. Fine, made another choice.Ordered oatmeal shrimp, waited for 20mins, waiter told us it was sold out as well. Why didn't you let me know earlier? I would have gone to another restaurant.Chili crab is good though
5
Jumbo was referred to us by hotel manager for good sea food. Its really good and on the river side.
Food was awesome. Simply great sea food. Only problem is the table availability. Plz book in well advance to avoid disappontment.
5
it's ok~Restaurant landscape is good~~~~~~~~~Service is also very good~~~~~~~~~~~The crab is very big~~~~~~~~~~Two girls are very full.~~~~~~~~~~~
5
It was my second visit to be there. Enjoyed. Fried prawn was also valuable to try as well as crabs with beer.
4
I can say that it was still the best crab in SIngapore but I find the taste of Cereal Prawn and Baby squid to be the same as Those you can find on Hawker center
4
Best chilli crab you'll ever have... Simple ! Picture is for a single serve.. I suggest you order bigger if this is your first time!
3
I made a reservation many days before the actual dinner timing and was told to wait another 25 minutes for an indoor table to be cleared. I was fine with this and walked around. I came back and got seated to a table. I was then served with tea which the waitress did an appalling job by pouring the tea while it was simply flowing out of the kettle jar. The whole table was wet and the waitress didn't seem to give a damn. Snacks was then heavily dropped onto the table rather than being served to the customers. I see the service is really bad in this outlet. The chili crab I ordered was alright, it was big, but surprisingly, the claw was very small with little meat. Well, I think I should go to other competitors and comment on their service.

I really wanted to have Singapore chilli crab in Singapore, jumbos did not disappoint! Yes it's noisy, and busy but sitting outside on the riverside up to your elbows in crab sauce it seems appropriate! The mud crab was cooked perfectly! The sauce was not too spicy, which I prefer, and the fried buns were deliciously crispy on the outside, light and fluffy inside...great experience

Sadly I am only giving this one out of five. The food (we had chilli crab) was delicious but was let down by terrible service. From the moment we arrived it seemed to be difficult to gain anyone's attention met had to ask twice for another menu (only given one). We were asked for drinks choices and they arrived. We asked one waitress what one of the dishes was but she couldn't help and eventually when a waiter arrived we asked for the information and he provided this and then we ordered. Food arrived quickly. However, we ordered chilli crab and only one pair of pliers arrived. It took several minutes to find a waiter to ask for a second pair. Another passing waiter offered us gloves too ( not provided when we ordered)No plate provided to put or crab shells on - we had to use our starter plate. No one returned to ask if our meal was ok, nor did we get an opportunity to order more drinks. We didn't see a waiter during our meal apart from the delivery of our food. I asked to speak to the manager before we finished our meal as I wanted to request the service charge be removed from our bill. Generally in restaurants the service charge is added as the norm in Singapore and I genuinely think this makes some service delivery indifferent as you pay for the service whether you get it or not.Surprisingly the manager said he could not remove the service charge even though I listed all the reasons why we had had such a poor experience. He did say he would amend the bill but the service charge would remain. I do find this incredulous as shouldn't you have a choice to pay for a service? Happy to tip if I receive a good service but actually it doesn't seem to matter here. You pay anyway. The waiter was very very apologetic and our bill was discounted so a reasonable outcome but I would rather have had a positive experience to go with the delicious food

We went here with some friends a week or so ago - the chilli crab is a MUST. Absolutely amazing sauce and the crab was cooked very well. Fingerfoods we had included some crispy fried squid and scallops fried in a sauce - everything was gone within 5 minutes. Really enjoyed it.Only downside - beware of the Tiger lady - she only sells Tiger beer, and we made the mistake of asking for wine..
4
Food is good. Service is good. Maybe the only minor complain is that the aircon is quite weak during some part of the night when the restaurant is full. So it is abit warm. Did not complain to the staff as we are about to be done with the meal
3
fitting its fame for every menu being really delicious but employees were cold, not laughing, not answering well.
3
Have been to Jumbo many times
Service on this visit not up to standard
Should have been a lot better
5
Nice place for a family dinner, good location and great food. The chili crab and prawn is excellent, reservation is a must otherwise you need to wait for a long time. The price is much higher than food court.
2
Singapore chilli crab is one of the great dishes of the world,but unfortunately this crab did not live up to this reputation. Service was slow and unfriendly and the crab when it arrived was disappointing, not hot, and presentation was not great. Plenty of other places serve this great dish... try them instead
4
It is so noisy and so crowded that you just can not enjoy the food ! We were there on a week night and still got a time limit in which we had to give up our table !The classic Chili Crab was good though, but we can only recommend this place for a fun Event. Do not go there if you plan a romantic dinner ;-
4
First time in SG. (16/05/2016) our appointment are EATING...!!!! So first place that we are going to is here "Jumbo S/F Riverside Point" we were there a bit early and got a 2nd queue ^^. When we got a table it was raining a bit sadly but when the food start served all the staff especially Ms. Yvonne Tan and her team made me crazy ^^.Her service was very excellence very helpful, friendly and professional and made me and my wife designed to go back again today (17/05/2016) Thank you very much for your good take care..
5
Every time I come to Singapore, I come to a Jumbo to enjoy Black Pepper Crab. Outstanding every time - never disappointed. The pepper sauce provided slow heat as the crab is eaten. The crab is broken up enough for the sauce to seep into the shell and coat the meat. The mango and duck salad as a started is also a favorite. This restaurant is almost always full so a reservation is required if you do not want to wait an hour to hours to be seated. With a reservation and showing up on time, seating is almost immediate
5
Easy to get the way to this shop and you can see the river view in the evening.It was so crowded in weekend.We have to wait for longQ with funny people.Just wanted to suggest ,if you want to go in weekend better do reservation first.I like to eat chilli crab non-stop.They had available for others menu.But I prefered my chilli crazy crab.Definitely, back to this place again!!

Was in Singapore for a brief stay, and a friend recommended I try the famous curry crab. After looking online for best places to try this dish, I settled on Jumbo Seafood, the riverside location. After a brief wait (shorter time period if you are willing to share a table), we were seated in the inside dining room (no views but with air conditioning). The curry crab was very tasty and only mildly spicy. It's a bit messy to eat so be prepared come prepared to get your hands dirty! However, my satisfaction with the restaurant stops there. The service was underwhelming and food very overpriced. I will not be returning

We always seek out Chilli Crab in Singapore and this trip was no exception!This time we chose Jumbo at Riverside due to a previous good experience. We queued for approx. 1 hour on a Saturday night at 7:00pm. The electronic queuing system was extremely effective and even worked with an international mobile allowing us to go and grab a drink in a neighbouring bar. When we came to order we were looking for some large crabs, however were told all the large crabs were sold out - a little disappointing given we were quite early on a Saturday night. The largest they had was around 900g so we went with this option. The chilli sauce was lovely - spicy and sweet and the fried buns delicious. The crab did feel small unfortunately with some of the legs hardly worth the effort (although the claws were delicious!). Crab was around $70 SGD a kg in April. Service was pretty good, no issues on this front. Overall a good experience, but think we could do better!
5
We had good time for JUMBO.
All the food was delicious.
If I want to recommend other travelers .
We look forward to your good food and good service.
5
Great place to eat by the river. Superb food get there early to be sure to get a table. Wear old clothes because you will get loads of "canteen medals" eating the wonderful chilli crabs.
4
Went there to celebrate daddy's sweet 64 Birthday. Food was good enough for 8 of us but wish their portion could be more generous for the price we paid. Relatively expensive but better than some similar restaurant...
4
Well it's good chilli crab .
It is a very busy restaurant so if you don't book , expect as we did to have to wait and expect iffy service .
Glad we did it though.
5
They didn't take a telephonic reservation, so we stood at their reception just minutes before they opened and surprisingly got in pretty quickly...though the restaurant filled up very soon after though it was a weekday at lunchtime.The chilli crab went rather well with the bao bun. The bbq prawns were large and tasty. Their version of fried rice was also very good.My family and I stuffed ourselves at this fairly expensive meal but each of us including my kids who are rather finicky about their food...found it to be well worth it
4
I really enjoyed the dinner I had in Jumbo, certainly not for the unique atmosphere or the good service but hey, let's be honest: the food is great! It was my second time in Singapore and actually the first time I tried Chilli Crab. Too bad I had missed it during my first visit, I loved it! Also tried the Pepper Crab but would always choose the Chilli version. As starters I can recommend the Pumpkin Shrimps and the Cereal Shrimps, very delicious. Apart from the food, the location is really buzzing, right next to the river, very busy and lively. Otherwise don't have high expectations in terms of service or the atmosphere, that's more the chain restaurant style. But I definitely give four points for the food
4
This outlet carries on the Jumbo quality. Quality of food here is consistent with what we come to expect from Jumbo. All the favourites are there. Service however is too fast!! All our orders seem to come almost at the same time and we can't take our time to enjoy each dish like we would like to. We actually had to tell them to slow down the service!Also the tables were closer together than usual. Tables were really tightly squeezed and little room to move.It is pretty obvious they want to optimize numbers of diners and table turnover.I'd say A- for the food. B for the service. C- for the ambience
1
Service was poor and very slow, food ordered wasn't what we got and yet i was told it was, staff where uninterested when we complained about what was delivered but they did change the dish eventually. Service captain equally inert to the situation.This is not a cheap experience anymore for signature dish of crab and after going to jumbo for over 15 years I doubt I will bother chancing it after the last experience
3
As expected, pack, lucky we booked in advance. The whole experience is mixed. Food is good and deliver in a timely manner. But the service!!!!! It was bad. Cleared the table before we actually started, forgot our drinks order. All in all, sure could find better in Singapore.
4
The age old argument in Singapore is which is best? Black Pepper or Chilli Crab, and Jumbo is where you would go to try both. Jumbo is THE Singapore seafood restaurant chain, which are all brisk, bustling and fun places to eat. Everything is always super fresh because they sell so much seafood everyday. Definitely the GOTO place for my Singapore friends and for me if I need to entertain. Regarded as a Singapore institution amongst those who know
4
Very busy restaurant right on the banks of Clarke Quay. The food was great especially the chilli crab. Another delicious dish is the pepper crab which I'd say was on par with the chilli version. The cereal prawns are great too.
5
This was a very very busy place. Clearly this is because it has reputation for serving great quality seafood. The reputation is well deserved. The food was excellent, the service was fast and although very busy the restaurant was brilliantly well otganised.

good food, service maybe can be better

tried their best seller chili crab and it was really really good! had it with fried rice and breaded shrimp which I gpt curious with since the shrimp is covered with bread crumbs but tasted like garlic and cereals or oatmeal... yummy!
5
Oh my, the best chili crab ever. Amazing. Highly recommend. All the food there is terrific. It does take awhile to be served, so make you order some appetizers.

As we wanted sea food we found this restaurant at the river.At that time only locals were in the place,a good sign for us.The place is huge,all seats were taken and most of the people were having sea shell bowls (fruits de mer).We took salads and sea bass.Both dishes were mediocre and badly presented.Within one hour we were outside agai

We had been wanting to try Singapore Chilli Crab for ages so as soon as we arrived in Singapore headed down to Clarke Quay to Jumbo. On arrival at 5pm we asked to book a table and were pointed in the direction of a computer and told to book ourselves in?? Obviously a young people's restaurant as some elderly folk would not be comfortable with this arrangement. We were allocated a reference number and sat outside on a wall waiting for the call. We sat for over an hour and were only given a table at 6.15 after complaining for the 2nd time that others were being called whose numbers were well after ours I.e. Our number was B12 and we were now well into the C's. To make matters worse they stuck a card on the table to say it was needed back at 7.15 (one hour to enjoy our chilli crab). We ordered 2 starters, 2 chilli crab, and 2 beers. The bill came to 265 Singapore dollars. Hugely overpriced. The toilets were the filthiest I have come across in Singapore which I consider to be a vey clean country. Hand washing facilities were separate from the toilets and while washing my hands I was looking into the kitchen. I suggest the owners take some of the money they are ripping off the tourists and use it to renovate those bathroom facilities.
3
We arrived Sunday at 12pm just as they opened. We had to wait a while to get served which was fine as they were already quite busy. The problem was all the meals arriving at different times, up to 30 mins apart. I had finished my meal by the time the next meal arrived and still one person was missing their meal. They also forgot some of our drinks. Luckily the food was delicious.
4
There may be other better things on the menu, but most people will come here for the famous chili crab. Although pricey, it is delicious. The restaurant is near the Clarke Quay area, so weekends and evenings must be very busy, but when I went, it was early afternoon for lunch, so there was really no excuse for the perfunctory waitstaff who seemed to simply go through the motions. At this restaurant's price point, they should really be a bit more enthusiastic about their work
5
Singapore chilli crab was an explosion of flavours that made my mouth sing! Great fun wearing bib and making mess while trying to crack shell. Not recommended for a first date. But do try the steamed and fried buns that are like little fluffy marshmallows to mop up crab soup (go for 5 each at a minimum). Note I've never had chilli crab before but think this would be hard to beat. Staff very efficient and helpful. Suggest making a reservation but we didn't and managed to get in before lunch service closed
5
My friends bring me here and i eaten good food, but liked so much chili crab and rice with shrimps , the service was good .
4
Really nice food and good quality. And a price to match particularly for the chilli crab $70 which I understand is delicious. Will definitely go again
1
The most important thing is that the food are not delicious. And service is not so good. price is very expensive and invisible.
4
Whilst the food was excellent, the service was a little less as prices for 800 grams crab were in Chinese and depend on the weight of the crab. The options for bread turned into 2 very small thumb sized buns, and despite the rush for me to pay before I finished my food I cannot fault the quality, a meal that included egg fried rice and two drink for $110 - pretty good really, however I do agree staff could be more friendly and happy and less col
4
Delicious jumbo chili crab! Very messy, even for people like us who are used to peeling crawfish and crabs. My main suggestion would be to make sure you make reservations pretty far in advance. We tried to make reservations the week we were in town and none were available. We wound up waiting over an hour for a spot at a shared table. It was worth it, but would have been nice to have a reservation
2
Although there was not much to complain about the food the place felt very commercial and the staff cold! I was 2 minutes early and was told go away until your booking! No one smiled and everyone seemed to hate their jobs! Maybe try somewhere else
4
Planned for a team dinner for 12 pax. Reservation made via Chope 2 weeks earlier, reached on time and expected to dine till latest by 8pm as it will be next time slot for other dinners. Food was served promptly. Quality of the food is good. Personally, I would prefer the chilli crab to be cooked a little spicier.
2
I had black pepper crab, oatmeal shrimp and veg. The live crab was so delicious with tender meat. However, the black pepper sauce was too salty to me. On the other hand, the oatmeal shrimp was good, fresh and chewy. Well, I still prefer the size of shrimp from 龍海鮮. In general, I won't recommend u if you have ur own slow tempo on eating. Because in jumbo, u only have 60-70min to finish them all

Most of the staff are from mainland China and Malaysia. Based on their Mandarin accent and vocabulary, none are local Singaporeans. Minimal English. If you have problems with ordering food, you're clearly out of luck. To be polite, I spoke English so the guests at my table could also understand what was ordered for dinner. I got so frustrated with the waitstaff I had to begin shouting in Mandarin just to get my table's order correct. We even had to walk to their service station to get utensils ourselves. Clearly, they are too comfortable relying on default business income from tourists.They only leave 1 menu on the table. Clearly, it's Chinese style where the head of the table will order for everybody. Westerners are not used to this concept and clearly must ask for additional menus. The seafood is priced wildly. For the crab, it's SG$80 per kilo (usually 1 dungeoness crab). The fish priced at SG$20 per piece. Sadly, they were about 2 bites per piece. The squid was not even whole and was in shreds. It's like a plate full of fried batter bits. Their stir fried noodles was so wet and goopy it's barely edible.Their piéce de resistance is their crab. People order this dish to sop the gravy with bread. Sadly, this restaurant missed the point. They do charge extra for Mandarin buns (man-tou) that do not soak up sauce well.Please do not patronize this place. I hope the management will wake up and realize how distressing my experience has been. This is not the Singaporean experience I remembered growing up just across the causeway bridge

After waiting almost an hour to be seated we attempted to place our order quickly because we were very hungry. We ordered the chili crab since it is said to be the best in Singapore however, we tried to order a few other items that were all sold out. We asked our server to put in the order for the chili crab while we decide on some other items. We never saw our server again! When the crab came the woman who brought it slammed it down on the table so hard that the sauce shot out all over the table. She then walked away quickly. We had no cutlery or napkins and were ignored by everyone we tried to ask for some. By this point we were one of 5 tables left in the restaurant all looked un impressed with the service. Tired of waiting I got up to grab what we needed from the sever station myself. A woman from another table followed and did the same. No one seemed to even notice us in there service areas. The crab itself was good but we had to eat somewhere else after since we were not able to order more food due to the lack of service. Overall the place is beautiful and food seemed great, I just wish the service was at the same level

Excellent food but you always need to book way in advance because this is one of Jumbo's smaller venues on the island. The food is really delicious and we never had any complaints.
1
From the very first dish i knew that it was going to be bad. Everything just didn't taste the propper way. The dessert was horrible we had like ice from the frezer with a weird sauce over it!
4
Food is great but expect to deal with a so-so service. The receptionist and order taker will not treat you nice.
2
Had to asked twice for chilli sauce and waited quite long for it. Staff were not able to explain to us clearly about the menu and pricing in english. Need to wait for another staff to attend to us in english. Had 1hr and 15 mins to dine, very rush, by the time we order our food, we were left with not much time. Had to rush through my dinner with my family who came to visit me from overseas. Overall, i was not satisfied with my visit at this jumbo branch
5
You need a reservation for dinner, and you need to make it many days in advance. The food is great! Best Pepper Crab in Singapore. One of the first stops when in the area. You are provided with 90 minutes to eat, then you are moved on
3
Definitely get the Chili Crabs with some white rice and small buns so you can soak up the delicious chili sauce. The food was good here. Service was ok and bit slow. We noticed that they did not give us bibs or bowls with water so we could clean our hands
1
Expect a bathroom in the style of suburban Cambodia. Although I suppose the toilet is a plus. I mentioned it to the service staff at front desk who laughed it off, and said "not our building." I said "where should your customers go?" They said "yes that bathroom". Zero care for you. Zero care for your food. I've lived in Singapore for a year and the service made me uncomfortable. They serve sharkfin soup, so that's worth considering coming.
2
We were a party of 11 on the day, seven adults and 4 children, the restaurant was packed for a Monday. the welcome was good but the restaurant is not equipped for toddlers, the tables are too close together and the kids will get bored and in the way of the waiters who will definitely get annoyed with them always running around. we ordered 1 chili crab, 1 pepper crab, fried fish, baby squid, cereal prawns, fried rice, and fried pows.the prawns were excellent so were the baby squid, but the chili crab was so overrated maybe i kept my expectations too high but not the best chili crab i have had, i even preferred the pepper crab. the rest of the food was so-so. we did have some drinks like 3 coconuts, 3 fizzy drinks, and 1 beer. the amazing thing is when we received the bill we had to fork out s$700 for the little we ate. that pill was difficult to digest. so if you want to go to a so'-so restaurant and have the cash for it do not hesitate, i will definitely not go there again.
3
Ate here after a long day in Singapore. One of my friends had his chili crab here before so he recommended going here so we could finally try Singapore's famous Chili Crab.I have to say though, for the price range, service was mediocre. No smile, no fuss, inaccurate service (we ordered rice with the Chili Crab and Black Pepper Crab among other things, but they didn't serve the rice until we have asked where it was).I can't compare with different restaurants in terms of how good their crab dishes are, but I can say I do not regret having my first taste of these crab dishes here. The chili Crab was good, but if you can only have one and you have to choose between the two, choose the Black Pepper Crab. I loved it so much more
4
I could stay in Jumbo and eat all the chili crabs and salted egg prawns that I want, however due to the long queuing line of waiting customers this is impossible. Of the many times I've been here, I really find the service crappy and pretentious
4
Everything we ordered tasted great, staff were efficient, sitting indoors is ideal to avoid the elements
4
Each time I have colleagues from overseas I treat them to a feed of black pepper crab....if they behaves themselves!😀.
The beer is cold, the service efficient, and the food tasty....the decor is average though I go there for there only for crab!
3
Don't let the queue put you off, it moves quickly. Stick with the classics and you can't go wrong, but be prepared to get messy! Delicious food, attentive service but alcohol is expensive. A regular for us when visiting Sg.
5
Second visit here but still excellent taste of chilly crab. The restaurant of the staffs were friendly and smily ^^
Had a great time being with my students eating and talking♡
3
The Chili Crab was delicious, also the chicken satay. However, we had to see that this company serves shark's fin soup, which is an abomination that is banned in many civilized countries. Finning sharks is a crime against the marine eco system, and I would never again eat at a restaurant that serves shark's fins
5
Every time I go to Singapore, I do not miss my chili crab at Jumbo Clarke Quay. It has become a tradition. I love this tasty and generous dish, I love dipping the small buns into the sauce and spend the evening sucking out every piece of flesh from the shell. With a couple of chilled Tiger beers, I'm in heaven
5
I love chili crab and this restaurant serve the best of it in singapore. It is expensive but it's worth. Don't expect a high quality of service in this restaurant. Is too crowded and a long queue is waiting outside. I would recommend this restaurant for crab lovers.Dinner 3.4.201
3
Everyone told us to try the chilli crab in Singapore, so we did, good but nothing special, unexperienced with crab, made our dinner a luttle messy, the restaurant is ok, although more expensive than others serving the same, but this has its reputation, we paid 90 usd for two people
1
This place is really too crowded to care for customers.mwe walked in to the restaurant and wanted a table for 6. The host was yelling at us to get a queue from the machine which was completely blocked by customers. We were very mad. We left immediately. Finally, we visited next door for chili crab which is also nice and very good service. We would never go to jumbo again for sure
5
Ferociously busy outdoor restaurant. But the staff are cool under pressure and well drilled. Small waiting area. But you can give them your phone number when your order number comes up they'll text that your table is ready if you've going walkabout. The menu is extensive but the crab dishes are the star. Chilli crab and crab with black pepper are fantastic. Crab comes in a pot chopped up with lots of rich sauce so order rice as well. Washed down with tiger beer. Hard to go wrong. It's not cheap but what is with seafood and it is a tourist trap so to be honest 4 people will eat well but budget $400
4
wow the superb chilli crab ever in singapore. taste was really good and nice. not really spicy for indonesian. a bit sweet.
prices it's not expensive.
4
Jumbo is famous for its chilli crab and it didn't disappoint. A busy bustling place. great fun and who cares about the mess.
4
We have reserved a table at Jumbo Seafood Riverside Point in advance. The food and service there were very good. However, the restaurant was very crowded.
3
The place is rather cramp and I was quite disappointed with the size of the crabs served to us. Jumbo is known to serve large size crabs but what we got were crabs which could also be found at kopitiam zi char stalls
3
On a recent trip to Singapore, my husband and I ate at the Jumbo Restaurant - where he wanted to experience the famous Singapore Chilli Crab, which he thoroughly enjoyed.Disappointing when waited to be seated, to be told that you had to have finished your meal and vacated the restaurant within 1 1/2 hours
3
Basically the signature crab was tasting good, but the customer service is yet to improve! The menu online wasn't updated which has one dish less without deduction of the set menu price! One dish from online menu supposed is signature cereal prawn whereas suddenly changed to boiled prawn which not special at all and a bit disappointed. The reservation is necessary, the table was arranged on time, however the table need to be returned within 1.5 hours which is a bit rush for crab eating
4
Ordered the chilli crab requested extra spicy , fried rice and fried mantou ( deep fried bun) .The crab was very delicious as this time it's spicy and NOT overpowered by the sweetness of the sugar.Fried rice was fluffy and well stirred !!Mantou Were quite mini sized so had to order extr
2
I was so excited to come to Singapore and eat the famous Chilli Crab from jumbo, but unfortunately I left feeling very disappointed in the whole experience.I had booked online 3 weeks prior to arriving, only to be told when we got there that we could only have the table for 1hr15mins as there is another booking at 7:15pm. A bit annoying but as long as they bought the food out quickly I didn't think it would be an issue.The Chilli crab was nice, the sauce had a nice little kick to it but also a bit of sweetness to offset the chilli. We also got some fried buns to soak up the sauce as there is a lot in the bowl.The restaurant itself is busy, loud, staff not helpful and they just don't seem to care or want to be there.We ordered 2 drinks only 1 came and then when we asked for the second one they just seemed very confused and took twice as long to bring the second drink ( a can of Coke) We also asked for water for us too and one glass came out dirty with bits in the bottom of the glass.We ordered straight after the table next to us did (they were locals) , the exact same meal. Theirs arrived quickly and we waited another 15-20 minutes for our chilli crab. I don't know if priority is given to locals over tourists but they seemed to get more attentive service than what we did. I was really hoping for a fun experience as I really wanted to try the chilli crab, wear my bib, take my time and enjoy a few beers.Instead I was left feeling unwelcome and rushed. For the prices we paid (S$78 per kg for the crab) we could of had a meal in a better quality restaurant I feel.Next time, I think I'd be better off going to a smaller restaurant in China Town, paying a lot less and getting more personal service
2
Well.. let's start from the beginning; a group of 5 of us visiting Singapore from out of town. Had a few drinks before dinner and when we realized it was getting late - we decided to call to see if we could squeeze a tasting of chili crab into our visit.We called in advance - sadly, they take no reservations but assured us that they could seat us. Upon arrival, they said they couldnt seat us and because it was 1.5 hours before close, they wouldn't. We had to argue that we called 30min prior and only then were seated after a wait.We ordered and the food came out quickly -the food itself is absolutely delicious. Live chili crabs were reasonably priced and the mains are priced for small/ medium/ large - with large feeding a family of 4.Our order had barely come out of the kitchen and we had our server pestering us to pay. And I don't use the term pestering lightly- we didnt have time to wipe our fingers. And he returned to ask us if we can sorted the bill every 2 minutes. The icing on the cake was when we approached closing time. To clarify: we weren't leisurely eat, or gossiping over drinks. We were on a mission eat crab and we were dedicated to that task. Until they turned off the lights on us. Yes, 2 minutes past their closing time and we were left in the dark. No accident, no apologies - darkness. We requested they be turned back on - they were. For another 5 minutes before being spontaneously turned off again.We left only 10 minutes past their closing time, unfortunately with a very sour taste in our mouths
4
Having heard good reviews, my friends and I decided to give it a try, as we were in need of the famous singaporean chillie crabs. Initially we were told we had a 45 minute wait so we entered our details in their reservation system. It allows for international numbers to be used #winning. We then went over to a bar next door and luckily before we could order anything we received a call that our table was ready at Jumbo. (What was the point of chasing us away for 45 minutes?!?)We were glad with the cereal prawns and chillie crabs we ordered. The little buns are a must-have with the crab gravy - to dip. However the staff barely know English and are not courteous at all. if only the staff were trained at treating the customers better, our Jumbo experience would have gone up a notch. Oh, we were also told we had a 1.5 hour sitting, and just in time the staff arrived and started clearing up our table.
4
We love the black pepper crabs and drunken prawns! Very nice Atmosphere especially if you sit outdoors!
5
Best food especially chilli crap
I should come again because chilli crap
Never forget it in my life.
4
Absolutely loved the chilli crab. The place was rather busy as we went on a Saturday. However were able to able to get the table within 2mins.
5
We had chili crab cereal prawns and fried bun. Food was tasting excellent. If you are not making your hands dirty eating the crabs you are missing something in your Singapore trip
5
Probably cheap for Singapore but still fairly expensive for us. Chilli crab was amazing,.... Huge and delicious. Extremely messy to eat here. They even provide a paper bib! Hilarious! Do not wear your best white white shirt or dress here! Hugely populate venue and very busy. Not always a bad sign eh? Lovely setting against riverside which is a lovely stroll afterwards down to the light show ...about 20 mins at our slow pace! Enjoy X
1
Absolute rubbish restaurant. Got the chilli crab which is apparently best in Singapore which is an out right lie. Crab was tiny and had no meat. Got the crumbed prawns which were dry and an odd taste. They offer you tea and have nuts waiting for you on the table which they the. try charge you for later. Service was average. Worst of all my partner tried to use the women's toilet and when she went in there she almost threw up! There was toilet paper everywhere and urine all over the floor. When we approached the waiter they did nothing. Spoke to the manager nothing. Go to china town, half the price better atmosphere and a toilet you can use
4
Singapore is famous for Chilli/pepper crab and as the Jumbo on Clarke Quay is nearby to where we were staying there was no excuse. As expected the Chilli Crab was amazing but very expensive. I agree with another reviewer it is Australian mud crab and nothing more exotic. However it was cooked to perfection. One portion was adequate for two of us. I have seen on here that service is not that flash and also agree. When we were seated we were given an allotted time to finish our meal and leave, which in one way was good, at least we would be served expediently, which was the case. It was very busy and the staff were running to keep up, there was also a queue of patrons waiting to come in. I don't know if I would bother going back as we prefer a more relaxed eat, which this was not, and there are plenty of other restaurants that serve this dish in a more amiable way. However, the crab was very good and I can't complain at all about that hence the score of four
4
Chilly crab and black pepper crab definitely should be on your order list. The chilly crab sauce is amazing.......specially with some rice or bread. We also had the prawns with duck egg yolk which is so another amazing dish worth trying. Expect a long queue or try to make a reservation before hand.
4
I am so happy that we had a reservation, as this restaurant was fully booked for the 2 nights that we were in Singapore. Definitely order the Chilli Crab with some fried rice to soak up that delicious sauce. And expect dirty hands and a belly full of deliciousness! They had a good selection of wines and other drinks too. The service overall ok, however we had to ask for necessary extra wet wipes a couple of times. But the food for sure made up for this!
5
We ate here as the Chili Crabs were suggested to be the best and they were good! The dish is a little spicy but not mouth burning. We went with a group and each couple ordered a crab to share along with a rice. The food was delicious and more than enough! I will definitely return here when in Singapore again. Also located along the water front so really nice place to be
4
Nice ambience and good food! Brought my customers and all provided good feedback on the food and environment.
5
Wonderful restaurant with a perfectly seasoned black pepper crab. Good wine assortment. Very nice and professional staff. I will come back.
5
I always tell people who are visiting Singapore to come to Jumbo Seafood and get the Chili Crab. Everyone has always enjoyed it. The atmosphere is great on the water.
4
We love chilli crab is very yummy. If we are back to singapore again i will go to this restaurant for sure.
4
This is a fantastic restaurant situated right on the river, it has a vast selection of dishes including some lovely fish dishes, the food quality is excellent, we had to wait around 15 mins for a table of 4 as the place was very busy which did make the service a little slow
5
Recommended by concierge at Marina Bay Sands. Went for Sunday lunch - 2 people. Was seated and served promptly. Chili Crab was delicious and fresh. Not too spicy. Set menu too large and not value for money for 2 people. We had just Chilie Crab and rice. Recommend booking a table if a larger group. It wasn't overly busy and service was great
3
We went to Jumbo on a recommendation from some locals and were lucky to only wait only 15 minutes before a table was ready. Once seated our drink order was taken promptly and delivered to the table. Then came the long wait to get our food order in. The waitstaff just ignored our table for a good 15 minutes whilst serving other tables that were seated after us. When the food arrived it was very good. We only ordered a chilly crab and some fried rice with prawns but that was more than enough for the two of us. The food made up for the wait to some degree but the service dropped the score from very good to average
4
Came for dinner with friends, took forever to get any service to the table and when we did it was very slow.We ordered a lot of dishes and shared, the food was great and overall very happy with the experience. The weather was nice and had a table on the river walk.Would recommend for seafood fans when in Singapore
5
Best Chilli crab in town. Costs about $70 for two people for the chilli crab plus rice $12 which is more than enough for two. Try and stay away from the set menu ($148+) because looking around the restaurant no one could finish all the food that came with it!The crabs are delicious and really fresh.No need for reservations. Been there twice now and without any reservations and there's always a table available
5
No visit to Singapore would be completed with out eating chilli crab! We were told by locals to try the crab at Jumbo Seafood and it didn't disappoint. The sauce the crab comes coated in is like nothing you would have ever tasted. Make sure to order some fried bread rolls to soak up all the juices and be prepared to get messy you won't want to leave a single thing in the bowl once you start.
5
we have booked in advance about 1 week before we fly to Singapore and staff are very nice and helpful. if you have not try Chilli crab yet i really recommened this restaurant.
4
Everything was fine. very kind, clean, good taste.
But we are surprised when we got receipt.
Because they charged for tea and peanut.
when they asked me for tea and peanut, there was no mention that it's chargeable.
Anyway it was good experience.
2
The crab is not bad, but also not "the best in town" as many claim.
The service staff on the other hand is unmotivated, not that friendly and unprofessional.
4
As usual, really good black pepper crab and cereal prawns but service is worst every time. Too bad!!
4
Place has excellent location,on the riverfront. It was very crowded with lots of people waiting in line,so I was able only to eat inside. I tried the famous Chilli Crab,and its very delicious. The price though its a little high (100 Sgd) with only 1 drink and some bread. No good thing,they charge you the two small appetizers and the hot tea that they bring to all table without asking
4
Very busy place and the staff doing very well. I can not understand other review but i can tell if u friendly to the staff they friendly to u. The crab are so good and fresh like nowhere else. We love chilli crab and black pepper crab. The price fair for the quality u get. The place could be abit more nicer for us therefore only 4 stars. We will be back :-
4
This was the only restaurant in Singapore where we had chili crab. We thought it was outstanding! We could see other delicious looking dishes going by and would have liked to return to try them too (although the chili crab was so good, we would probably have ordered it again). The service is not very friendly or helpful. We noticed that "savvy" customers who had ordered the chili crab had also ordered a dish which they dipped into the chili sauce. We didn't really know what to do with all the chili sauce and we didn't order anything to "soak it up". We always like servers who make recommendations and they certainly weren't inclined to do so here. However, we would happily return despite the service
5
It was hard to secure a booking as this restaurant as it is very popular - especially with the locals - but it was worth the wait. Chilli Crab was amazing. We had a set menu for 2 which was too much food. So next time will order individual meals
5
My wife and I met up with a friend here for obviously chilli crab. Boy was it amazing. The sauce was very tasty. We also had scallops in xo sauce, garlic steamed prawns, seafood noodle, the fried bread rolls dipped in chilli sauce and seafood fried rice.. All came to just under $200. We'll worth the price!
1
It was their 35th Wedding Anniversary and you RUINED it!SHOCKING how you treated guests I recommended your restaurant to. I will take this up with the authorities. The staff Spoke rudely, added items to the menu the guests didn't ask for, made them pay for the meal before it arrived to their table and turned the lights off before they finished their meal!! SHOCKED at your RACISTS behaviour !!! You made them hate Singapore
5
Vow... this is simply the best place to taste the best seafood in town... Chilli Crab is simply the best... Love going there again and again.
4
Had a great meal here with friends, very messy! We had, of course, the Chilli Crab, also black pepper crab and some chicken and noodle dishes. All really tasty.
Worth a visit whilst you are in Singapore.
4
Great relaxed atmosphere for work or family gatherings. Food is first class. I recommend the pepper crab - enjoy
3
It was soso.
The foods were good, but the services are nod good.
Next time I visit, I expect better services.
3
I don't get the attraction of buying a kilo of crab and only being able to eat 200 grams, but obviously others do. Even with a booking there was a line outside. Not my thing really, but the Thai msz loved it. Says it all really
3
Did my research of where I wanted to get my chili crab. Saw many mixed reviews on Jumbo Seafood (most were about service), and had walked past this location near the Quay. Looked very nice. But once arriving, my patience was diminishing. Plenty of tables, quite a few out on the terrace, but only saw staff dining there. Waiting about 15 minutes just to be acknowledged we were standing there to be seated. There was another couple before us that waited patiently. All of us received little responsiveness once they knew we had no reservations. (Yes we had no reservations as it, at least seemed to us to be an off lunch time hour, say 2pm)!After being seated (inside), we ordered two large tiger beers, crispy fried baby squid, 2 orders of the buns and not sure how many kilos of the chili crab was ordered. Both the waitress and waiter was very patient when we ordered. As polite as they were, there was a feeling of being rushed as I noticed the other customers facial expressions. Tables are close to each other so we watched what others were ordering. A few caucasians, lots of Koreans and a few from China. Food was overall good, but rather expensive. About $145 U$D which is pretty high for lunch. We were charged for tea, which we declined, since we were drinking beer. Didn't notice the charge until we returned to our ship
5
We have always been lucky enough to get a table right at the river side with great views.For us this is the best place for Chilli and Pepper crab. The price reflects the good size of the crabs. The baby octopus with sweet sauce is another favorite dish.You will not be disappointed
2
Went there with the wife for a nice dinner. I had told her how amazing the chilli crab was. Normally visit galang but thought the Jumbo might have improved over the years. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed. The tables were not clean, the staff was not attentive and made us feel as if they were doing a favour by serving us. They were just in a hurry to get us out the door. Very Very disappointed. Back to the no sign board in galang we go
5
Visited this place twice during our stay last summer. Very difficult to order a table at short time notice, but our solution was to arrive after "first serving" and at that time they always managed to find a table for us. The chili crabs was unbeatable, and we enjoyed a late evening at the river front
5
We went there after 9 and made a booking a week before. That night, we were soon taken to our table by the quay. The staff were really helpful. The waitress helped us with lots of group photos. They also let us have pandan cake in their restaurant without any surcharge.It was really a great experience to have dined in this restaurant
4
The food I have tried there are:
Seafood fried rice, Pepper Crab and Cereal Prawns. These food were excellent.
The service may get a bit slow during peak hours.
5
Chilli crab was sensational. Worth the splurge to experience and enjoy the delicate and delicious chilli crab. A must must do.
5
It was a true Singaporean experience! The food was awesome, especially the mantao and chili crabs!!! OMG! The mere thought of it makes me hungry!
1
I wated 30min for rice.
But they didn't apologize to us.
And They was not answered.
I feel unpleasant.
5
The atmosphere is crowded and loud. The air is filled with spices and the smell of crab. The food is absolutely amazing. It's pretty expensive, but I would definitely recommend eating here if you want the Singapore Chili Crab experience.
5
The chilli sourc was absolutely greatest taste ever!
And the burns must be addtionally ordered with source. It was crispy and soft.
5
First time going in this restourant, you should take a quee to reserve the table. Best chilie crab ever, they serve it well in creamy and spicy sauce. They also have amazing cereal prawn, it's sweet and chruncy. All the things they serve it fresh. Love this place. Better if they have a lower pric
2
We are regular visitors to Singapore and have frequented Jumbo several times. Unfortunately although the food was ok, this last visit we felt it was very expensive particularly the signature chilli crab and black pepper crab which frankly can be found elsewhere much more cheaply and equally as good. We could only recommend Jumbo if you are there on expenses otherwise try a visit to Chinatown for the same thing at less money and more authenticity.
5
With the infinite dining options that Singapore has it is difficult to categorically add restaurants in the To Do list but this has to be one of them that has withstood the test of time. We ordered garlic asparagus and a spice, salt and pepper prawn. Our main courses were Black Pepper prawn and a Malay noodle dish Mee Goreng (we asked for a chicken version as my family does not care for squid and we already had prawns ). The prawn and the crab were of course the highlight for me. Interesting despite both having pepper as the seasoning the flavor was distinct and delicious. The surprise was that the noodles were also so yummy. Of course the ambiance of sitting by the Singapore river is the bonus. Do check this place out on your trip.
5
We decided to have a late dinner on the Riverside in Singapore on New Years Eve , and watch the Fireworks display to welcome in the New Year, as an alternative to spending our usual New Years Eve in Sydney.As you can imagine, most restaurants on the Riverside took the opportunity to charge premium prices for this spectacular event......but not Jumbo Seafood, who had a very respectable set price for a multi course dinner including the Singapore speciality, Chilli Crab.We had an excellent dinner on a quayside table, the staff were extremely attentive, and the dishes were excellent quality,even though the large restaurant was full to capacity as you can imagine on such an eventful evening
4
Visited here as my wife wanted to try the Singapore Chilli crab, which she did and which she thoroughly enjoyed. I went for the seafood Mee goring which was also delicious. Not cheap by any standards but good service and great food.
4
cereal prawn, fried rice, chilli crab and 1 water, 1 ice lemon tea, I ordered. It was so delicious but too expensive. 21.89 sing Dollars!!!:-(
5
Love Chilli Crabs and Mocha Ribs. The chilli sauce is great dip for the bread.
Make sure you make reservation if you plan on coming to this restaurant, otherwise there will be a line for it.
2
They didn't accept my discount coupon because of only holiday without any announcement. my feeling was upset, food is so so ~~
5
the staffs were very friendly and helpful.
the spicy crab tasted really good,and the view from the riverside was lovely.
5
Famous restaurant at riverside - good quality of sea food, good atmosphere, nice and friendly servce
4
What can I say the chilli crabs are delicious!!! A little pricey but worth it!! Their salty fish fried rice was yummy also!!!
4
Chilli Crab, Slated egg prawns, Fried Horfun seafood with chinese tea on the riverside for two costed SGD 169. The money was mainly for the ambience, food quality and the occasion. We could not book a reservation during peak hour even before 1 month! And when we reached we were shown the corner-most seat! We could see extra tables were packed to cater to Valentine's day! Overall, a decent experience inspite of the fact the restaurant is taking people for a ride utilizing the occasion
3
This restaurant is the top priority for our trip. 'We must eat here'.. we all agreed. We've booked a table at 12.00 pm and popped up little early (15 minutes early) before being seated. Just only 10 minutes after, most of the indoor tables were occupied. We quickly ordered our meal as not to be wait too long. Of course we did order one of the must try list, Chilli Crab with bun. It looked great in a big portion. But all of us had the same thought, the taste was just like a Mackerel in tomato source! As it was big and we also had other dishes so we could finish it when it cold which effect to the taste. So for the tourist, I recommend to try a local favourite dish, just for your experience and nothing else
5
The was really good! The crab was really fresh and the sauce's great! We really enjoyed this menu and also the rest were good- we had fried rice with shrimp (we ordered small portion but the portion was big!) and deep fried tofu. The price was a bit too high but compare to the quality it's not too bad to pay for
4
The crab was delicious. The view aside the restaurant is very beautiful. There are so many good views along the Singapore river. It's worth to visit and have a dinner there. We had a good time during the trip.
5
very good！this time ,i have a happy experience in your restaurant. the dish is very delicious！thank you for service！
5
Pepper crab is spicy and delicious.
Seafood soup is tasty.
Price is standard and acceptable!
Went there at 530pm and reataurant was full right away. So make a booking
4
This is a very nice restaurant. It's always crowded and busy. I can understand that all because food is marvelous and delicious.
Jumbo Crab was great. Service is good. Will return back for sure.

Can't go wrong with this if you wantchili crab. I've tried a few times and this branch is still the best one
5
Food was just excellent and great service as well. Highly recommended. Not that expensive as well. Good ambience. Great place to take friends and family.
3
We asked where to get chili crab, and we were told by the hotel concierge that this was the place. We enjoyed the riverside area, but the food and service were just so-so. We would love to have found a place that locals like for the chili crab. They do eat it, don't they
5
Many would think that Jumbo is catered to tourists which translates to overpriced and overrated. I assure you, the chilli crab here truly is the best. Do expect long queues, mediocre service in a very crowded restaurant. Make a table reservation 1 or 2 days in advance especially if you have a large group of people, you need to be patient though because they're usually too busy to pick up the phone. If it's 2 or 3 pax, it's okay to walk in and if you don't mind, share a table with someone else so you don't have to wait too long. As for the price, I'll admit it is slightly over average if you compare to hawker stalls or other not as famous restaurants but really, it's worth it.Will visit again soon

Admittedly the pepper crab is pricey, but if you want good food, one that fills you up that you could barely stand up then I think it's worth it. We ate at the Jumbo Seafood from a recommendation of a friend. We had fried rice, the pepper crab (both the hubby and I can't handle heat from chili), sweet & sour fish. Taste is to die for, very tasty, it's big enough for us 2. Only thing is if you come at peak hours expect a long wait. We didn't have reservation, and even those who did had to wait in line. All in all, a thumbs up for good food
2
We tried to make our night-out very special before our departure and decided to enjoy the famous "Singaporean Chilli Crab".The restaurant proudly has a wonderful location by the riverside, but the price is just OVER-PRICED, their draft beer was stale and service staffs were simply "They don't bother".I wouldn't recommend this place at all!!
1
taste is good, but staff is very unkind,
taste is good, but staff is very unkind,
and although i was reservation, i didn't sit good position.

Service was so so, disappointed in the chilli crab, was a little cold when served.
A lot to pay for lukewarm food
5
This famous restaurant is right on the banks of theater in the Clarke Quay area of Singapore. Great seafood and noted for its Chili Cranbs. On the expensive side, $60-70USD per portion, but well worth every cent!
4
Be prepared to pay for the ambiance to avoid disappointment. Centrally located, great food, service. An ideal place to spend your evening for business or family and friends.
3
Been there with a local contact on a business trip for lunch. Based on what I heard and experienced, I guess it is definitely overrated. Spare me if my rating is not justified for the Chilli crabs that we didn't order due to the amount of effort required considering a business lunch. We ordered steamed fish, which was almost tasteless, calling it Mild would still be an overstatement. Prawns in sweet chilli sauce was mediocre too (like in any other place I have tried before). Ambiance is pretty basic and table arrangement a little cramped. Definitely, not my kind of place
4
Ok, if you are able to differentiate between the Quality of the Food and the Quality of the Restaurant/Service this is a place to have decent seafood for a reasonable Price. Why do I say this? With chinese style I mean: come, order quick, eat quick, pay faster and make room for the next guest. If you are OK with this, enjoy the Food.The Food itself has never disappointed me. Always fresh, tasty and enful to really fill your hungry stomach. So you like seafood, make a Reservation (!!!) and enjoy. But make sure you don't dwell too long :-

Went here on my last night of Singapore trip. Had to wait 45 minutes to get a seat for 2 of us. Ordered Chili crab, 2 mini bun per person (initially ordered 1 per person but they said there was a minimum..) and 2 steam rice (however, they only took down 1 steam rice). Had to ask for the basics starting from gloves, aprons, wet wipes at the end of the meal (although they gave me serviettes instead of wet wipes).When we were almost finished with the Chilli crab our rice had still not been served. So when I asked if our rice is still coming they had a rice cooker about 5 steps across out table and poured a bowl of it and gave it to us.When we ordered our meal and were waiting for the food to arrive the waiter gave us a small bowl of peanuts. However, this was charged on to our bill (only ate about 1-2 pieces) which I was really pissed about as it was not mentioned when he first gave it to us.Overall, the service was terrible and it was highly overpriced. I wouldn't return when I go back to Singapore
5
Jumbo was my first experience with chili crab and I absolutely loved it. Later, I tried the dish at many other restaurants but none was comparable to Jumbo. The recipe of classic chili crab at Jumbo is the best. Their crab is also very fresh and with firm meat. Would highly recommend this place, especially if you don't have to pay :
3
We visit Jumbo Restaurants on a regular base, so we thought we try the riverside outlet on a Sunday night. We found the restaurant relatively crowded with mainly tourist. On arrival they seem to have a ticket system and when the table is available they call via your hand phone, I guess that is rather out of place for a restaurant .when called we were sited outdoors which made a lovely ambiance. To start off our meal we ordered steam bamboo clams, but strange they arrived after or main dish (chilli crab), which was the highlight of our meal. Itâ€™s a messy dish to eat, but we still enjoyed ourselves. Efficient wait staff also kept refilling our cups with warm Chinese tea so we were always well-served and well-fed. All in all, a pleasant and overpriced dining experience by the riverside. By sharing your experiences, you're helping travelers make better choices and plan their dream trips. Thank you

We saw Jumbo on. Promotional video in our hotel. Got there And hc to put our name and other personal details into an electronic system. We tried to ask questions re the menu but told to wait until our number came up. Totally ridiculous. Not customer friendly at all. We ended up leaving before we were called up because the staff were so rude. Went upstairs to CFJ seafood, were treated like valuable customers and head a wonderful meal. Bad luck Jumbo for not getting our business
4
Service was fast and plate change was constant, which is a big plus given this is a seafood restaurant. Food is good with crowded and great atmosphere.
4
Taxi driver told us to try this place and we werent disappointed. Had to book for an evening table, but not necessary for lunch apparently. Fast efficient serviceand delicious food, can't say more!
4
Generous portion of good food to entertain guest
Only draw back service a bit slow (e.g. order a jar of beer, took about 15 minutes to deliver) not too sure why as there are lots of staff around
5
4+1 pax 2 crabs. black pepper crab very good. the taste of black pepper is well melted in crab meat. chilli crab ok. prawn very fresh.
4
Luckily we made reservations ahead of time, when we arrived people were waiting to be seated. We sat down and ordered Shrimp, noodles, sharkfin soup, and two diff flavors for the crabs. This place is popular for a reason, must try.
5
I'm sure there are places in Singapore that serve Chili crab (one of the national dishes) in a less touristy setting, maybe less expensive or less fancy. I had never been to Singapore, and I'm not sure how long it will be until my next visit. I went with the most reliable choice and was not disappointed. I was further bolstered by the crowd of locals eating here. It was walking distance from my hotel and the food was delicious
2
I'm sure there's someplace in Singapore (Momma Kong's?) where the chilli crab is worth the price, but Jumbo Seafood is not it. Service is brusque and impersonal. The entire atmosphere is one of a factory food restaurant that is not offset by the food quality. The crab was decent, but one crab plus a plate of broccoli and two beers is not worth $122 SGD.
4
Price is quite expensive, and all food come at the same time when you order set menu. Service was good, very attentive and pro-active. Food taste's good from starter to dessert. Long que at the restaurant - suggest to make a reservation in advance if you want to get a nice seat
1
As a tourist, Jumbo is so famous but so not worth it in hindsight. The grandma serving kept on bringing hot tea and peanuts that cost extra but never told us. The crab is not a Sri Lankan crab, but a type that'd cost $20-30 per kg in Australia. I've had better tasting singapore crab locally at a quarter of the price. A warning for all tourist, go at your own risk
2
For starters, this place is an absolute zoo...Service is slow and it's basically a factory. We didn't have a reservation got a table at 6:10 and were told we have to be completed by 7. I'd suggest going to somewhere else that is a bit more welcoming. Service was also slow.
3
Complete overrated location. Food is good, very expensive, you get the service of a typical touristic place... good for a large group of people, otherwise i am sure you can find better places!
4
Delicious chilli crab. Tried the pepper also but the chilli is the best. Lovely setting next to the river. Food was good - a must try.
5
Missed the Jumbo restaurant in Hong Kong, but made up for it in Singapore at the Riverside. The sweet and sour shrimp were an absolute delight, titillated the taste buds to extreme. Fantastic. The sago desert afterwards was delicious.
5
The chilli crab is amazing! It's a good idea to book in advance as there was a line there every day and night that we went past. It opens at 12pm, so if you haven't booked, try to get there at about 11:30am to get your position in the line. They have a couple of set menus that will give you a great selection of their finest, or you can order a la carte. It wasn't the cheapest place that we ate at, but you certainly got value for money; we couldn't come close to finishing the set menu. Must do while in Singapore
4
As long time residents we are over chilli crab, but we still bring first time visitors to Singapore to Jumbo at east coast or riverside where they get good views and reliable local specialties. Our guest the other night loved the food. We would have prefered white or black pepper crab! Riverside is very touristy though, and while service was pretty good, food was a bit slow coming out.
4
As recommended by many websites and words of mouth. We decided to give a try, although afraid of some tourist trap. This place does not disappoint. We ended up ordering Black Pepper Crab and it was extremely delicious. Highly recommended, but make sure to make reservation first. At times you might have to wait for quite a while
5
This location is much better than the Clarke Quay and the East Coast Park. Takes no time to get a table and get served. We were two friends and we had one full pepper crab each. The cereal de shelled prawns and squid were excellent starters
4
Remember this, when it comes to good food, you will never be short of choices in Singapore. Taking that further, when it comes to sea-food, even more so. After our feast at the Makansutra Gluttons Bay last evening, Clark Quay would be our haunt this evening. And so, we went on a rampage. The manager at Jumbo Seafood told us to wait for about 30 min -- a 30 mins wait on week day? What is the probability of getting a table on a weekday then, we wondered. We didn’t wait though. We ran to the next famous place there – Harry’s!Back at the Jumbo Seafood after 30 min of Harry's, we started off with local Tiger beer followed by fried prawns in cereals. The prawns weren’t a great choice as the batter was really sweet. Then came the dish we were drooling for – Pepper Fried Crabs and Chili Crabs. The former was one of the best I have had, perfectly cooked, succulent with adequate flavor of peppe. The latter, Chili Crabs, were served with the traditional buns and was good, but not as good as the one we had at the Bay area the day before. Shark Fin soup and mixed fried rice completed what turned out to be a very heavy meal indeed. Overall, a must do and a must have when you are in Singapore
5
Some local friends took us here and as they already had preordered tables and some food, I cannot comment on that procedure. However, I just know the food was delicious. Very. Of course we had to eat their chili crab in addition to a fresh shrimp soup with some local herbs, their soft buns (which you can dip in the last crab sauce to catch it ALL) etc. Albeit not of the cheapest (but you know that before visiting a place like this anyway) the crab is a sure winner!! As someone reviewed here before, it's a good idea to bring your own towels, both dry and wet, because consuming this "animal" is kind of a mess. But it's wonderful to sit outside in the warm weather, slowly putting chunks of fresh crab meat in your mouth and feeling the chili makes you sweat that little extra. If (no, not IF but when!) we are going back here, I would prepare myself a bit better with the above mentioned towels etc. as well as maybe more time, making the meal even more comfortable
5
As the title says, we enjoyed great service from the JUMBO staff, esp. the manager Yvonne who called to confirm receipt of the cake which was scheduled for delivery over to JUMBO Riverside a few hours in advance of the reservation.Yvonne welcomed us heartily and even arranged for large crabs. The claws were huge and the meat was succulent and delicious
3
Please separate the position of the same nationality team.(make a reservation aside.)Uncomfortable with each other.
4
Trying to persuade others to try other chili crab, not successful though. The combination of the chili crab and bun either fried or steamed is still the best.
5
the best chilli crabs one can ever eat. By the bay an ideal setting for some great food.
The service is fast and food is amazing.
4
But the recommended pepper crab was super expensive at the beginning, it costs almost SD 580! Then we picked a smaller one as counter offered by the waiter.
5
I did a lot of research on where to find Authentic Singapore Chilli Crab and settled on Jumbo. It really was fantastic, worth every bite. I think we paid around $70 for a crab around 1kg which was perfect for two people, and quite reasonably priced compared to what you would pay in Australia. The sauce was amazing, definitely on my top dishes i've eaten during my travels. A must do when you are in Singapore and Jumbo is in a central spot, easy walk from most places in the Marina CBD area
4
I had been here once, a long time ago, taken by locals. This time I took my family to eat here while we were in Singapore. And boy, if you like crabs or other seafood, this is a great place, but the MUST on your plate are the chilli and pepper crabs. I personally prefer the pepper variety, but they're both amazing, and the location, right on the Singapore river front, are spectacular.Get a reservation ahead of time or you'll have to book a table and wait for a bit. We were told we'd had to wait 30' and then our table was ready in 5'... so take their numbers with a pinch of salt. Bring your own towels to clean your hands after the crabs. The lemon water and the wet napkin won't do the job alone! ;
4
I was really impressed by the food. The service was prompt and good. They gave us far too much fish for just 2 people, leaving us with a hefty bill, but the food and overall experience was very good. The restaurant usually has a waiting time, but it's worth the wait.A couple of days later, I went to Jumbo Seafood Gallery nearby. While the food was pretty much the same, the service at the gallery was really, really, REALLY bad. DO NOT go to Jumbo Seafood Gallery
4
Went with family to this restaurant on the East Coast. The crab, lobster and other fish was really well cooked and very tasty. You must try the chilli crab, but make sure you have something to keep your hands clean. To eat a meal by the coast is one of the best attractions in Singapore. You must go
5
I'm most impressive with the booking by Chope! when I arrived restaurant, after showing my booking on my mobile phone to the waiter, I was immediately lead to our table in less than... 5 minutes!however, the ordinary crab - big sized ones - were sold out, and the only kind of big sized crabs is the Alaska Crab which was much more expensive! I wonder if the ordinary crab was sold out all the time...?!
4
My friend recommended this restaurant for Singapore's famous Chilli crab. It did not disappoint in flavour or presentation. The crab was delicious, very meaty and a spicy tang. We ordered two fro four of us plus a seafood rice. It was plenty but a little pricey. The area around the restaurant was vibrant and colourful for a lovely evening stroll
4
Close to Clarke Quay bridge, this restaurant is always crowded and that seems to show the quality of its most popular dish "Chili Crab". It is worth waiting 30-60 minutes and will be better to taste it with white wine.
3
The food was very good, but not fantastic. Overpriced! Service is not good either. Don't ask for indoor table, request a table with river view.
4
Yummy chilli crab got there early when it opened due to it always Being busy. Sat outside nice view! Food came quickly, have a little one so need to eat and go who great! Have been Before and will go back again
1
I had food posioning after my experience and the service was really bad. I couldn't ask the staff any questions since no one of them really spoke English.
3
I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant that made my family feel happy. But I was a bit disappointed of the taste of chilly crab. Because the sause wasn't sweet or spicy enough to enjoy. The fried rice was the best food that I have eaten in the restaurant. However it was too much amount to eat with chilly crab. So I had to leave two third of the rice. I wish I could choose small size or big size of fried rice. I felt being treated well by waitresses. They covered my bag with big red cloth and handed over the papered bib not to be spilled on the clothes. Mostly I would like to say thank you. I and my nephew enjoyed eating chilly crab in Jumbo restaurant.
5
This restaurant is very popular in Singapore, both locals and tourists will come. So first of all, make the online reservation first, it is free of charge and it can save time for waiting. The food are really nice, I recommend you to try the pepper crab and the lobster, they are really delicious. As I came during Christmas time, the have a set for four people, cost you $288. I think it is worth money. And it maybe cheaper than separate order. If you come to Singapore, I think you have to try
3
Unless you really like chilli crabs, and prepared to pay a premium, this is a pass. Extremely popular and busy, and best to reserve if you want to avoid long wait. Great location by the river side and outdoor seating is great option with cool breeze in the evening. Be careful with the chilli crab portions and generally one of it is sufficient for two adults
3
Jumbo is famous for one thing and one thing only - The Chilli crabs. It really is awesome. If you have to- order a couple of crabs and don't bother with anything else on the menu.Service was very unfriendly. No one smiled or looked liked they wanted to work there. No one spoke English apart from the 2 guys taking the orders, again grumpy faces when taking orders.It was nice sitting outside next to the river but the outside of the building was quite dirty and smelly.
4
This place is famous for their chili crab and it truly is a great one! If you are going there try to order the food the Chinese way which means that everyone around the table share all the dishes. One chili crab is enough for four persons so order more of the amazing seafood they have on their menu. I have to say that the fried rice with seafood was probably the best one I've ever had! Another tip is to not wear white clothes, you are going to eat with your hands so have that in mind when you plan your outfit, hah
5
While vacationing to Singapore, went there on a Sunday without reservation. Surprisingly, managed to get a table within 20 minutes. This place is famous for it's chilli crab. Man, it is totally not overrated at all. The crab is just too delicious for words. One advise for couples going there, do not go for the 2 person set, you can never finish all the food! Just a single crab is enough for 2 person, and if you feel you need something else to go with it either order one more dish of vege or rice/noodle
5
All dishes were amazing and very tasty! Whole family enjoyed the food and service. Highly recommended for must visit in Singapore!
4
Good food, Good view, Good experience, Good service. For example, crab is fresh, riverside view and waiter was helpful to take photo for us
4
We really like everything especialy shrimp with sour and sweet sauce. However, asking money for extra tea is unnecessary.
4
Have heard a lot about Jumbo - the place to go for Chili Crab and Peppercrab in Singapore and in our last trip to the city, went there in the evening. Getting a place is the first hurdle, and we gave our mobile number and spent the waiting time having a drink in the pub next door. When our turn came, we were told that we need to vacate the table in an hour and 40 minutes, so that put us under pressure. We went for the tried and tested - chili crab and buns, some noodles, washed with a bottle of wine. The service was very average and the place is cramped so not a place for a leisurely dinner. However, the chili crab made up for all the shortfall in service - it was superbly tasty and polishing off the gravy with the bun will remain a good memory of Singapore for us
3
Crab so so, we wanted to order creamy crab they don't have. We ordered black pepper and chili crab. $88 per kg of crab. Easily any other Chinese seafood restaurant can beat them.  Other than that, we ordered 3 eggs vege, sticky paste and tasteless. Fried home made tofu was also normal nothing special. The only dishes are nice are the seafood fried rice and soy paste big head prawn. They serve prawn to us on a individual plate. The soy paste was sweet and salty, the prawn is nicely cook, the meat are still chewy and juicy. After all, the only reason it's nice to eat there because of the riverside. Long queue, many people willing to wait for it. Services are good, constant changing clean palates, make sure your water are filled, bag is nicely placed and covered.Total bill for us $490 for 6 adults. 2 crabs+man tou, one vege, one tofu and one fried rice. Too pricey
1
Granted the Chilicrab was good but the customer service was awful. I think the only time the waitress smiled was when I put a $10 tip in her hand. I think they are overpriced and even though the Chilicrab was good it wasn't worth what we paid. They charged us all the way down to the peanuts on the table. Well I guess I can at least say I tried Chilicrab in Singapore.
1
The waitress was very rushing and no smiles at all. The price is $140 for one chilli crab plus two 'small' dishes $18 each. This is fine dining pricing but we had terrible customer experience - the worst of our thee day trip in Singapore. It seems target Chinese overseas travellers so they don't care about feedback. The worse was they didn't even recognise their 10% off for Singapore airline passengers OR KrisFlyer member. They wanted boarding pass and physical membership card! I showed them the KrisFlyer email and membership number and they didn't care. I believe this level of service would one day cost them a lot
5
Holidaying in Singapore with my family and was recommended to try this restaurant. Upon arrival was told that there is a 30 minutes wait for a table. We were contemplating whether to wait or go to another restaurant. We decided to wait but instead of 30 minutes, we waited for 45 minutes, not happy as we were hungry by the time we were shown our table. Did all our ordering and the food arrives within 10 minutes. We ordered baby kailan with sambal, salted egg prawns, scallops in yam basket, chillies crabs with fried bun and supreme fried rice. All dishes was very tasty and not disappointed. It was worth the 45 minutes wait
4
Well established chain offering Crab with pepper and chilli etc plus lots of other dishes.Very good crab, fairly expensive by local standards, but great taste. Good selection of other dishes, good service, and a nice outdoor area as well as inside tables. Mix of locals and tourists. Reserve ahead or go late as its busy here
3
Wow, the place was heaving. We were allocated one hour from getting to the table to be out, which turned out to be more than adequate. This place is all about rush and that truly adds to the experience.My wife's first experience of chilli crab which overall did not live up to the hype or her personal expectations but I thought was quite good. It was too hot for her overall but thats her taste. The crab is very tasty although naturally size of claws etc is a bit of a lottery. We had a crab each which was generous portion and made the spectacle for us. The experience was let down by lack of hand wipes and water in the finger bowls which we had to keep asking for (simple fix for the owners). The fact that we had to ask for crackers and pickers was a surprise too.We'd recommend it to anyone visting to try this classic Singapore dish but we will probably seek out some other restaurants next time to compare against. Once we've done that we'd be happy to revisit the review to put in the context of the competition
4
Is always our best outlet, compare to all the other outlet we went, their master chef should be in this outlet. It will never fail us. Price wise still quite pricey compare to the rest of those small little coffee shop stalls la.
5
Had chili crab and pepper crab both were excellent flavoring and well cooked. Seafood fried rice was unbelievable especially mixed with chili crab sauce. Service was quick.
5
Last year I went here and it was a 2 hour wait and so crowded. This time I went at lunch time and it was fantastic. No wait and almost empty. The food is super. The Black Pepper Crab is amazing. As was everything!
4
We went for a dinner at Jumbo Riverside to try the Famous Singapore Chilli Crab and it was fresh and tasty. The dinner experience could be better if the staff was more helpful and friendly.
4
It was good food for my friends from Germany and China who enjoyed the chilli crabs and salted egg golden prawns.Only disappointing thing is that they are unable to eat the steamed bamboo clam with minced garlic which everytime we are at JUMBO, this particular food is always sold out or unavailable. Hope we can eat it again when we are there the next time..
2
$550 for five people to eat an average portion of average-tasting crab. Felt foolish afterwards: we got sucked into the tourist trap. Shame on us for not asking what the market price was -- don't make our mistake.Had a 6pm reservation and were asked to leave at 7:15 to make way for next reservation. Also ordering "3 pepper crab; two chili crab; three beers; one glass of wine and one water" became a two-minute Abbot and Costello routine because that was apparently too complex of an order to be comprehended
5
The food is really great, its not expensive. I mean i ordered a crab (not to mention the size of the crab) and another dishes and it cost me about 50 dollar. Those 50 dollars that i spent is totally worth it, like literally worth every single cent. Well, i ate the crab with my mom and i couldn't finish it in one night, so we decided to take it home and eat it the next day. The food is fantastic, but the queue is not. I went there on a weekday, its not yet a holiday season, i mean its exam week when i happened to have an affair in Singapore and i decided to eat there. Its really crowded, i thought i'll be the only one there. But it definitely isn't. The receptionist told me we could go to somewhere, their other place but it was kinda far i think so i stayed there and waited. Its kinda a long wait, but in the end the food is great, me and my mom were really satisfied
5
 came here for the black pepper crab, had the cerael shrimp, was a bit too sweet for my liking, but the seafood here is undoubetedly delicious and authentic. They also provide bibs to make your experience here more memboralbe. Expect a 30-45 minute wait if you don't make a reservation prior.
3
The crab is good and fresh same many other places also. The price is also ok. But the restaurant is same as a better fastfood place and the service very unfriendly. Sorry i'm a guest and yes i'm the reason u have to work. But! my money pays ur salary. We had also 1 bottle of wine but had to serve our self :-( say already... same selfserve place. Will not be back... never
4
Great for a team outing - just go only for the crabs - Pepper and Chilli ! You cant go wrong - throw in some beers and you're in for a great evening - gets very messy but thats the point . Excellent location in Clark Quay - just bang opposite the small Malacca or Read Bridge - beautiful photo op spot dont forget the camera's. ! You can hit the bars across the river first and then settle in or it after - and walk along the river to digest all that food . Value for money 
4
It's really good to come here to celebrate my birthday. The food tastes good. My baby and I are very happy!
4
Good atmosphere, slick service, tasty selection. The gimmick is chilli crab whilst wearing a bib. Much needed! They say it's an institution. Was certainly full and a lot of fun.
5
My friends (who visted Singapore first time) are really saticfied with their taste. And We had good time at your restaurant. Excellent !!
3
Food was okay. Not very special, normal. But the service was horrible. If you love seafoods, this restaurant may be your choice.
5
The crab was so tasty!
However, it's a little bit expensive for us.
I will definitely visit again when traveling to Singapore.
4
Try the chili crab and the taste is very delicious with bread. scallop with broccoli, garlic prawns & jellyfish with Thai sauce. It was really very satisfying & we would recommend others to dine there
4
We got there Tuesday at 515pm without reservations and there was a line. The hostess was able to give us a table at 530pm but we need to finish by 645pm. We ordered the famous chili crab, calm, shrimp and veggies. All the dishes came fast and was tasty and flavorful. Just make sure you make reservations
5
Every time I visit Singapore I make sure i visit one of the many Jumbo seafood centers. This time the Jumbo at Clarke Quay Riverside. We were about 8 persons and reached there about 8.00 pm. As usual the place was packed and there was a wait of 30 minutes. The wait was worth it as we are all dying to have the black pepper crabs. They were yummy. So were the prawns, fish, vegetables and rice. Overall excellent sea food as always. To top it off the mango pudding was great too. A must visit when in singapore.
4
The aroma and ambiance of the place just set my mood for a great feasting. My friends and I went there for our class reunion and annual dinner and to celebrate some of our birthdays. We ordered the usual and to reminisce the past whereby we would have gone to East Coast Park for our class reunion. Quality of food has shockingly dropped and service wise doesn't even need to mention it. What service?! We waited more than 30minutes for just our drinks and when it was neither crowded nor busy. No servers could bothered with us maybe they thought we were not thirsty and hungry yet as we were busy talking and deciding what else to order but I specifically told the server to get our drink orders served first.Chili Crab, Steamed Seabass, Salted Eggs Pork Ribs, Black Pepper Crab, Steam Prawns, etc.I guessed the "Ang Mos" - the whites and expats have spoiled and degenerated our formal level of service by being patient and tolerant and therefore being taken advantaged without even knowing by our service staff and business owners.Such standard should be reflected for the price of over $800 for below standard quality from a restaurant chain that's known for seafood
3
Food was of decent quality as expected of Jumbo seafood group. However service was severely lacking. It was very crowded but basic expectation is that tea cups will be topped up and water will be served promptly. my daughter asked for warm water 5 times before it was given (after more than 20 minutes) 
5
Fresh and muscular crab meat!!! Yummy, yummy..., a must to visit for crab lovers! Cereal pawns and yam cake scallops were nice too,
1
Terrible service , waited ages for food and when it arrived was given the bill! Took our bank card away for ages , we had to ask for it back.
Food was standard not the best in Singapore.
5
A little bit expensive but delicious.
What I found strange was that by arriving we got some nuts and jasmine thee which later where added on the bill.
I thought is from the house, because normally I will never order jasmine thee.
5

a little expensive，but excellent food. the night scene of clarke quay is beautiful. next time i will choose this still

Was here on Wednesday night.Bussiness was brisk. Wondering was it because of this that make all of the stern looking. We're here for 2 hours, none of the staffs smile. All were wearing a stern face.Even the lady who took order for us.Standard of the chili crab had dropped drastically! !Would not visit again. Disappointed
5
My husband & myself brought an oversea family to dinner at Jumbo & we order crabs in chilli sauce & in black pepper, chilli kangkong, scallop with broccoli, garlic prawns & jellyfish with Thai sauce. The food was very well done & we spent a total of S$340/- for 6 of us. It was really very satisfying & we would recommend others to dine there. In fact, we were recommended to join as member & on the spot we had got a 10% off our bill
4
Tried the chilli crab and the black pepper crab. Both were nice but much preferred the chilli crab as I felt the black pepper took away some of the taste of the crab rather than compliment it. The biggest issue I had was that the crab wasn't very well cracked when we got it and nothing is provided to help you if that's the case. I have years of experience eating crab and was able to help my eating partner with hers, however had I not been there I doubt that she would have enjoyed the experience as she didn't know the right technique to remove the meat and no assistance was offered. Also we asked for rice so we could enjoy the sauce the chilli crab came with and was advised that we get buns for that. The 2 tiny buns did taste nice and we did use them for dipping in the sauce and got great flavour from them, however you'd need 20 of them to be able to get all the sauce. I'd recommend this as a great Singapore experience and I'd happily have it again, but don't just take what is offered if you need / want rice ask for it and remind them if needed (the table next to us commented that they never got the rice that they asked for, however we certainly did). Also you will make a mess, it will be all over your hands and maybe your face. A very very small water bowl is supplied as is wet towels, I asked for extra wet towels and they were very happily supplied, just be willing to ask (and use your manners)
4
The food as always was very good. The De-shelled Cereal Prawns are my favourite and everybody in our party was impressed. It is still disappointing to see that tea is offered as soon as you take your table but is not clear that you will be charged until you receive your bill. Peanuts are placed on the table and you are charged even if you never ordered them. The food standard is very good but dishes arrive in no particular order. The fried rice always arrives last so all the good work done by the chef in preparing hot food is wasted because you can not start eating without the rice! Make a point and insist that the rice is served first and everything will be fine

Sweet chilli crab they told me - a must do, they told me. Look - it was nice to eat. It wasn't disgusting...it was tasty. But I was served it in this dirty little room out back, having to share our table with a bunch of others in a setting that really distracted from the whole experience. The crab was good - I wouldn't say amazing. It's pretty hard to mess up crab and soaking it in a tonne of sweet chilli sauce makes it even easier. The real king hit was the price - came to about 120 sing a head and I was still hungry. Beware - it is not all it's cracked up to be (excuse the pun). A bit of a gimmick.

We enjoyed the seafood at this resturant. The Sri Lankan crab was a treat. We had a BBQ prawns and lobster in a chinese sauce.
4
Food and atmosphere is good. Our guests have enjoyed the food and are happy with the services displayed. We enjoyed our food. Thank you!
5
Chilli crab was amazing and must be the best much w/ Tiger beer!
In order to enjoy this, you have to visit there around 6:00 pm and book it.
Otherwise you are gonna wait for longer time.
4
We ate chilli crab. Sauce and flesh are awrsome! Thanks a lot! And especially thanks for nice place.
5
The chili crab was so good. The crab had a lot of meat. There was a lot of sauce to dip buns in. Other dishes were also good. We had jelly fish dish and plain tossed vegetable in garlic sauce. The price was very decent for a crab dinner.Jumbo offered shared table option. That was a great idea to meet other people
2
We went hearing Jumbo is the best place in Singapore serving Chilli Crab as their signature dish. It didn't look like a very busy day like we usually found it to be with people waiting in Queue ...But the staff was very unwelcoming. The dishes and spoons on the table weren't enough...when we asked the waiter to get the spoon or pepper they would say yes and never return with it. We had keep looking for waiters trying to get their attention for the short supplies on the table. We paid about 70 SGD for a 800gms crab that was topped with lots of taxes while paying the bill. Warning : You'll be served with peanuts, chilli sauce and jasmine Tea even without you ordering them...that will be charged in the bill. So if you do not want, refuse...its not complimentary
4
Being in Singapore means trying the Chili Crab or the Black Pepper Crab. Near Clark Quay there is the Jumbo, a great place for that. In their menu, you'll even have the Singapore Sling. I highly recommend to reserve otherwise you may have to wait for 45 minutes
4
Passed several times and there were always a big crowd waiting. So i ended up ordering their award winning dish Chilli Crab and vegetable to take away. Order was swiftly taken and was prepared fast. But i was a bit disappointed at the Chilli Crab as th3 chilli sauce was a bit sweet and it covered the fresh taste of the crab
5
If you do know that here is where you want to go, book ahead. if not you just may have to wait slight longer, 20 min. we were 4. so it wasn't too bad. Also, be aware there is another jumbo seafood on the other side of the Quay. we had one crab of pepper and another of chilli. in my opinion, the black pepper was the better option, the chilli was a little too sweet for me. PEPPER WAS AMAZING!!!!!! Its not cheap, but neither is it extremely expensive, it is good crabs after all. you can order rice on the side, there is wifi, they come to clear your plates, was a bit freaked out at first, but then it needs to be done since crab husk would be everywhere otherwise. They hide your valuables, so don't forget to take them with you after
5
It was the weekend and wait time was around 15 minutes. The staff attended the waiting customers politely and ensured quick response to queries. Had heard about the Chilli crab and it was worth a grab. The tomato flavored gravy with aptly placed crab was truly awesome. The restaurant had a mix of guests from different nationals and the riverside view just added the just needed zing
5
Order two crabs,especially chilli crab; Oatmeal shrimp and sala.,Drink singpore sling and Barley water. four people are ate enough and like to sit riverside
4
Very good big crab in chilli sauce. Order some fried chinese buns (man tao) to dip the sauce. Service is so so. Popular restaurant always busy.
5
A must eat on every visit to Singapore. Always tasty and memorable. I hope they will keep their quality even after their fancy IPO!
5
Excellent food, great service!
Have been to this place previously with friends from work, but this time it was with the family. All had a good time together, and it was unanimous that Jumbo serves the best chilli crab in town!
5
Absolutely delicious chilli crab, the best in town and you can conveniently book a seat and they sms you when you're table is ready. One downer is the fact that crabs are Market Priced so the bill could be any amount? Weird as I didn't think produce could fluctuate that much? Delicious either way and it was highly recommended
1
After seeing this restaurant feature in Lonely Planet (and as we love seafood) we naturally gave it a go.It was busy even on a Tuesday evening! We had to make a booking on the machine at the door and we had to wait for them to call us - nothing wrong with that as they are obviously popular. Because of the wait we had high expectations.A table at the river with a view is what I had in mind but instead they seated us in the corner inside where it felt like sitting in a dingy restaurant. I asked if we could have a table outside but apparently that would mean going back to reception and waiting for a table.We went for the chilli crab and like many seafood dishes this was on the pricey side (about $70 each for the set menu).That would have been fine as the food was OK but the worst part (and the main reason why I am giving it the poor rating it deserves) is the terrible service. While we were still finishing up (and in the early evening) they started to set the tables next to us and made a massive noise. They were clearly in a rush to get the next wave of 'cattle' in.We were waiting for the dessert with nobody to serve us (if we walked out without paying they probably wouldn't even have noticed). After bringing the dessert they didn't even clear the huge bowl of crab leftovers which is beyond my understanding!It's just a huge shame that it seems like their focus is on the speed of getting people in and out (yet making us wait) instead of basic customer service. I would never ever go back
1
We had heard about the chilli crab so were Ok to wait for a table. Our waitress didn't understand English which was no problem except that she got the order wrong. We didn't say anything as we didn't want to cause a scene but when we got the bill we wish we had. What a rip off - and we were charged for the tepid tea and slimy peanuts that were dished up at the beginning that we didn't order. A real Friday 13th dinner
1
Overpriced, poor value for money. The famous chilli crab was tasty but not worth the wait and poor service. We ordered one and got two, drank warm beer, paid for peanuts and jasmine tea we never asked for and were only offered one napkin each. We sat crammed up next to the waitron service area, practically in the armpits of the service team. For SD 200, certainly a memorable Friday the 13th
3
Came here to try the much-recommended chilli crab for lunch. My view is that, while it's a pleasant treat, it may just be a bit overhyped. It's certainly an interesting ritual - you are equipped with aprons as eating the crab tends to get a bit messy! The accompanying mantou buns are sweet, donutty things, something of a contrast to the crab. All in all, fine, but not as exceptional as I thought it might be. One odd thing: although there were lots of tables outside by the river, we had to eat inside as they weren't using them - which was a shame
4
Ordered the famous Chilli crab. Requested for the Sri Lankan Crab and it was about $90++ per crab. Worth it and really enjoyed the food. Slightly disappointed with the waitress at that time because it seems that they dont understand what im saying (i spoke in English). But that didnt spoilt my experience eating ther
5
Great service, great food, had to wait around 40 minutes for a table on a Monday night but it was well worth the wait. Best chilli crab I've ever had.
5
My friend recommended that this seafood is so delicious. I look foward to having a dinner in here.
I got there I had a great seat and food. My mother wanted to be there ome more time. Thank you for great food and service.
5
Quick and efficient way to make reservation.
The food was good and the crowd is average on weekday versus those from Fridays and weekends.
3
it's just average. not that good. and it's too expensive for seafood. i don't know why they served nut with extra charge without telling us first.

Booked this for my husbands birthday meal as he loved it so much after our previous visit and often talked about the wonderful meal we had there. Booked for 7.30 and were advised they woul need the table by 9.00. No problem as we had 8 year old grandson with us. We got there at 7.20 and got the table I requested overlooking the river. So far, so good. Then they came to take the drinks order. Now, I am not arrogant enough to expect everyone to speak and understand English, and were it Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam (all of which we have visited) I would have understood, but in a country like Singapore where everything is written in English, I was surprised at lack of understanding by the lady who came to take our drinks order, or maybe it was lack of training/knowledge of the the product. We tried to order a mocktail for my 8 year-old grand son. She would not agree as it was a mocktail and insisted it was only for adults. We gave up trying in case this was a Singapore policy. Funny that subsequently we were able to order one on the other side of Clarke Quay, at the bar outside the Night Safari, by the pool at Marina Bay Sands and at Raffles he was able to have a Virgin Sling! We always started of by asking if it was possible to order one, and the courteous reply was a surprised, 'but of course' . Little did the know the problems we had the first night!After the drinks order, we chose the food but had to wait and then ask for our order to be taken. The chilli crab arrived very quickly, followed by the Tilapia and then eventually, the baby squid. This food was all as delicious as we remembered on our last visit 5 years ago. However, we had finished our fish and still no rib-eye beef as ordered by grandson (not a seafood fan). We struggled to get the attention of staff to ask but eventually, when we did, it arrived - I think they had forgotten his order altogether. The last half hour of the meal was spoiled by worrying that we would never finish by 9.00. Don't know why I was worried, none of this was our fault. After we had finished, we still had to go through the next endurance - trying to get the attention of staff to bring us the bill. If like in the U.S. Tipping was mandatory they would have been out of luck, but on the other hand, maybe we would have got better service. Would I go back, no. I am sure I can get good seafood with better service elsewhere

There are two famous dishes and drinks derived from the tropics of this great vibrant City State.The first is the Singapore Sling, sipped at the Raffles Hotel Long Bar.The second is a sizzling chilli seafood crab, cooked in a massive pot.This I enjoyed on my last night in Singapore with some good friends.We enjoyed a couple of chilled beers.The crab was sensational, sweet crab meat balanced with a rice full of flavour sauce.The crab was balanced with some lovely chilli greens.We enjoyed the mess and the food.Great fun
3
We visited Jumbo because my wife is a seafood fan and wanted some of Jumbos famous Black Pepper Crab. The restaurant was crowded with mainly people on expense account company night outs. Amongst the others were a scattering of westerners whose faces seemed to reflect my thoughts. Over-hyped average far-eastern eatery that has managed to attach itself to a great PR train that is pulling it to a place it does not really deserve to be.Incredibly overpriced, very average seafood
4
Decided to try this seafood restaurant on our first night and it was fully booked but they had a good 'waiting list' service, by registering your name and cell phone number. They call you when a table becomes free. We waited only 1/2 hour and had cocktails in the next door restaurant. We chose the chili crab, some rice and gai larn (water spinach). The crab is fantastic - spicy and very addictive, beautifully cooked with the meat tender and juicy.Service was good, very atmospheric as it is beside the river so lots of activity and we knew it would be an expensive dinner but it was worth it
3
We've been there for dinner in October and it was such a hassle to get a table! always fully booked. So we finally made a reservation a few days in advance and on the day we were told that we have 1h15min to eat and then we would need to leave. So rude for such an establishment, like it's a privilege to dine there...Anyway the food was great, lots of different seafood to try and the staff was very attentive. Would I go again? yes but i would ask for the last seating so we would have more time to spend and enjoy.
4
Its an absolute must to eat at Jumbo seafood every single time I visit Singapore.Their chilli crab is out of this world, we also had the fried shrimps in cereal which has an amazing combination of sweet and sour. The mixed seafood fried rice goes very well with the chilli crab sauce
4
A must-visit place when in Singapore. The location along the river was great, with lively atmosphere. A great place to enjoy the famous chili crab.
1
No service. Made to feel like it was our privilege to eat there. Told to vacate table within 60 minutes of seating - would be helpful if they actually served you in that time
Food was passé - much better elsewhere
Don't waste your time
5
Fresh seafood , good portion size , Make sure you either make a reservation it come early for dinner. The chili crab ,razor clams, are delectable. Prices are a little on the higher side but the experience was worth it .
5
Chilli crab was really my favorite here. Service is also good as they are quick to respond to every order. Parents also enjoyed a lot.
4
The service & chili crab taste is very nice.
I wish I could go there again.
But, I think the price is expensive......
4
I had chili crab and other dishes there, nice food. Restaurant next to Singapore river and during visited have Singapore river festival, they have performance also.If plan to have dinner here, recommend to book in advance cause have to be on queues. Anyway, have a nice dinner there.
4
Still one of my favorite seafood restaurants in Singapore with very long queues. Food is reasonably price but be prepared for poor service simply because they have too many customers. A perennial favorite with tourists because there are so many dishes which they don't normally get at home. Gigantic king prawns, chili crab with luxious gravy, spicy black pepper crab and steamed fish. The restaurant is in a very old building but the surrounding area is very nice. After dinner, a nice stroll down Singapore river is a must or a boat ride down the river. Clarke Quay is opposite the road and there are adventure rides there.
3
I took my tourists friends to this restaurant for chilli crabs. We got a seat fairly quickly and it was around 1.45pm. We were told that last order is at 2.15pm and the restaurant will close at 3pm. The food was good though I prefer the atmosphere at Dempsey. However, service was not fantastic. Service staff were in a hurry to get all orders although I am still waiting for one of my friends to arrive. While we were less than halfway through the meal, we were asked for any last order. We said no at that time but after less than 5 mins, we decided that we needed more mantou for the chilli crabs. We were told that we can't order anymore. Its just mantou and not some complicated dish. Also it was less than 5 mins. Do NOT come to this restaurant late during their lunch time otherwise you will feel rushed throughout the whole meal. I should have taken my tourist friends to a coffee shop for a truly authentic singapore chilli crab experience with no rush
3
If you're expecting the huge Sri Lankan crabs with the large mantou (fried bread), look elsewhere. No longer available at Jumbo. If you're looking to pay lots of $$$ for small tasty chili crab, this is it. All the locals will say Jumbo is for the tourists but I still see many locals eating here. The taxi drivers name off a list of restaurants that are supposedly better and that locals go to. That's my tip of the day....ask a Singaporean taxi driver where to go to for chili crab. Maybe it's me but all the food at Jumbo was kind of 'meh'. Service was efficient but don't expect someone to help you with a smile
4
Jumbo seafood at Riverside has one of the excellent locations in Singapore best for special dinners.This is the go to place for chilli crabs and pepper crabs,though there is a waiting time for walk-in guests as its always crowded.Best would be to go during lunch time to beat the crowd.The dishes are pricey but worth it.Very less options for vegetarians though they will customize and prepare if you request.Their Sambal kangkong and Seafood fried rice is one of the best I had in Singapore
3
For 6 adults and 2 children. We ordered 2 plates of crab dishes for $86 per plate, 2 pieces of cod fish and a large plate of spinach with century eggs. Our bill came up to $354...the food quality and service were just average.
5
Really delicious!
I want to go again next time!
Stacked like atmosphere promises and come back with friends
4
The service was good and customer- focus, brought a cake to celebrate daughter's birthday and the staff had kindly obliged to clear the table and served new plates and forks.
2
Came here for the crab which is recommended by the media. However, the crab is not so big and very costly. Around Singapore $85 for a crab!! I'd rather to save the hard earned money for other choices.
5
Visited this restaurant with my and another family. Had a great evening. The place is a bit crowded but both the food and service is great. Not the cheapest place but it's worth it.
3
Still prefer their main branch... Food with ambience there is irreplaceable.... This location is nearer to town but the cook... And ambience.... Ok to skip...
5
This is outlet at riverside is very crowded with local and tourists. The queue is about 30min but it is well worth the wait! The company has improved the queuing system where customers will get a queue for 2 people, 4 people or bigger group. Different groups have different waiting time. It is very orderly done!There are also chairs around whole you are waiting for your queue. Oh you could choose to share table or not with others. Sharing table means a shorter waiting queue but I still prefer to have our own table. The menu is simple and you decide to eat your favourite crab in various cooking style! I have chosen the chili crab which is a local favourite!In addition, the menu has other side dishes and I have chosen fried beef to complement the dinner spread.This outlet is also very near to Clark Quay and Central shopping centre, where the tourists should visit our Singapore river. This outlet also allows the tourists to have a clear view of the Marina Bay Sands Integrates Resort. This outlet is accessible by mrt, car and taxi as it is conveniently located along the Singapore River, another iconic attraction. I must say there are not many carpark lot easily available due to the high popularity of this vicinity to local and tourist
5
Every time we have been here it is packed with at least 10 waiting on standby so if you can book first. We arrived and looked a long wait so decided to check out quayside but only afew diners so back to Junbos. Managed to jump the queue as waiter mis understood my query lucky us so had a great shared table with a great unobstructed vie wof the river.Don't be put off by sharing a table usually just 2 other couples and also met very nice people. Others often quote expensive and bad service don't get this been here 4 times and also had a great night. The only thing different here is getting your dishes at the same time. it really is went there ready with any of the dishes because they are always so busy. Medium Chilli crab, what I call the startled fish, look amazing not alot of meat but very tastiy and makes a great picture and 3 very tastly side dishes. Add extra bread and dishes you can soak up all the chilli crab sauce it really is amazing but do not were you best shirt but thats another story--totaly worth the wait but try and prebook ignore any negative reviews honestly one of my top 10 resturants anywhere - a great experience JUmbos to me is what Singapore is all abou
5
We were quite hungry on our first evening in Singapore and the reservation system on the tablet showing up to 90min waiting time almost put us off; we took a walk on Clarke Quay while waiting and got the call from their automated system about 40min later; we got a table inside, good a/c, fantastic both the chili and the black pepper crabs (better the chilli when compared side by side), a little bit cheaper than in Europe; unfortunately no advice from the waiters, low knowledge of English..
2
Spend your hard earned money elsewhere in the city with excellent food. Crab was $90, it didn't matter how big it was. Reservations were 1h15 long. You had to give the table back at a certain time, and they write it down for you at your table, in case you forget. Sit down, shut up, eat and pay. Food was okay. The crab was tasty but not hot. All of the dishes were mediocre warm. The food is prepared ahead to get the customer in and out so they can turn their tables multiple times during the night. The bill was expensive, the food warm and overly sweet, the service is business driven. Save your $$
5
Very good! Make a reservation first! The riverside is very comfortable! Prefer the crab! But if late, some dishes have sold out!
5
It's very delicious, and the waiter and waitress are also graceful, there are so many people, especially chinese, I think this is ok and i feel very comfortable.
5
We had one of the most sumptuous dinners in Singapore here at Jumbo Seafood! We ordered the following: Chili Crabs, Mantou bread, Cereal Prawns, Fried Rice and Soup (forgot which one). I would go back here over and over again!
5
Good place for seafood, especially chili crab, as well as black pepper crab, prawns etc. It is crowded, so you need a reservation.
1
I brought some overseas colleagues for dinner last night and was totally put off by their level of service. First, I made an appointment online for indoors seating and they wanted to place us outdoors. Secondly, it's only for 1.5hrs slot, which means you get asked subtly to go when time is up. Third, the service person who take orders for my table is rude. There's no eye contact, she kept pressing me to commit the order, no suggestion or explanations for items not found on menu, and does not apologise when I told her off. Lastly, in my opinion, there are plenty of better restaurants out there for chilli crabs with much better service. Even my coffeeshop auntie is more polite than this Chinese PRC service staff. Try Melben, Long Beach and Paradise group anytime! For this fine dining price, the rest are also much more affordable.
3
We ordered a Singapore chilli crab, which was very nice. However, they didn't even provide or offered bread (which is typically provided with this meal in Singapore).The service was rough. Won't be coming back. There are many other places in Singapore serving good food with a smile
2
Chilli crabs are certainly good here. However, the restaurants is hyped up and the service is terribleWaiters do nothing but rush you through your meal. We had to ask for basic things like napkins and empty plates. Staff is rude. It was almost closing time and we hadn't gotten our food yet. They made us pay before our food even arrived and included service tip. Mind you - our service was yet to take place!Did not take any time to help us with menu and just didn't seem to care. Issue is that its become such a tourist attraction - I don't think they even care
5
Jumbo seafood holds one of the best seafood dishes that has a lot of creativity. Eat and enjoy the riverside view while the friendly waiters serve you very well. In my experience we have tried the pepper crab dish that was very nice.I recommend you to try the chili crab and the seafood fried rice. The restaurant interior is a premium standard which gives us a good environment to enjoy our meal. I recommend this restaurant to friends and family
3
very efficient and throughput focused chain that aims to get you in, fed and out ASAP. I had the chili crab - which was really tasty , even if messay ( that might be my bad !) and overpriced ( their bad). I was a thursday night walk in at 9 pm and surprisingly got a seat. Ordered was processed cooly and food served quickly. crab was excellent - very very tasty. I had the coconut juice from the shell and ate the insides - tip from another diner which was great
5
We tried our first Chilli Crab at Jumbos, whilst on holidays in Singapore. We sat outside well shaded by the verandah but still with good views of the river. Table service was excellent. We ordered one large crab to share between two, rice and deep fried buns. The crab which came in a large black pot, was beautifully presented. We had additional utensils to crack the claws and retrieve the meat. The crab was absolutely delicious, and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal. Thankfully bibs, finger bowls and wet wipes were all provided
5
Better reserve a table beforehand. Nice view and yummy chili crabs and pepper crabs. After finishing dinner, have a ride of river taxi, a perfect day.
5
Whenever I come to Singapore I have to visit Jumbo Seafood restaurant. Try Singaporean chili crab and black pepper crab together with fry bun. Yum!!!! You will never be disappointed. I promise you ^^
5
The wait is worth for a table here 40mts is not bad.we ordered the chillie crab on the set menu for two which was just sensational so tasty and yummy..staff our very helpful good restaurant over all Bravo
5
Amazing food - chilli crab, black pepper crab etc - unbelievable the best I have had. Well worth the effort for the great food. Awful service rice arrives at the end of the meal, drinks never arrive, wine was corked. I would still return for the food though!
2
Waited over an hour for a table - chilli crab was on our table quickly, our seafood fried rice took approx 30 min & the steamed buns didn't turn up at all. Great location however the whole experience resembled a feedlot - get in & get out. Happy to have experienced the famous Singapore Chilli crab but won't ever go back
5
Of course, you must try Jumbo in Singapore.We had Black Pepper - not the famos Chilli Crab. along with rice and some prawns. The crab was amazing, we all enjoyed it. Not sure why they only provide 1 nut ctacker and 1 pick per table. A lot of the menu is probably not for western tastes, but the pictures do help.
5
I frequently take my overseas visitors to Jumbo for lunch or dinner. They have always loved the Black Pepper or Chilli Crab, various Fish and other options.One area where Jumbo can do better is to have more options for Vegetarian dishes. The staff and chef need to be ready to offer these when asked and the customer should not have to struggle with it
4
If I have one Grouse against the Jumbo outlets, its the inability to communicate with the staff in the local language to get the best out of the menu. Not that the staff is rude or indifferent, they genuinely try but it is hard to understand.Now for the good part. Absolutely fresh seafood. Great quality. Great taste. Pricing that ranges from acceptable to bizzare based on what one orders.Fortunately, I had my Chinese friend along so communication was not a problem. She ordered the scallops (yum) wrapped in yam. BbQ Pork ribs. Chinese greens sauted in garlic and a flat noodle sea food broth.To my surprise the scallop yam combo rocked and the ribs laced with coffee bbq sauce took me to another level. Greens were done perfectly and the broth with pickled peppers the perfect happy ending.Gave the experience a Thumbs Up.
4
Went with a family of 5 whilst on vacation and made sure we booked(would highly recommend) as the place was very busy. The range of seafood was very good, service was fast efficient and friendly and most importantly the quality of the food was first class. I would highly recommend this place and will certainly go back there if in Singapore again
1
After hearing so many rave reviews we decided to go hear last night. We didn't mind waiting 20 minutes for a table. We had our 2 children aged 15 and 20 with us. The peanuts and tea came out promptly. Our drinks order was taken fairly promptly. After waiting 20 minutes for a waiter to come and take our order, we were left waiting waiting waiting ! Our spinach eventually came out along with the prawn dish. We were then left waiting over an hour for the "Signature Crab dish" to come. After numerous waitresses came and checked the docket we decided to asked for the bill. Only then did the waitress say it would only be another 10 minutes. Too Late. Maybe we should have taken more notice when they put down all the blinds in the restaurant.So Disappointing !!!!
4
Booking was make before arrive was smooth. (dont need to wait)
Lovely restaurant and friendly staffs. Overall very good, however food was serve too fast.
4
My first visit to Singapore was topped by a crab dinner at Jumbo. Now its part of the ritual and Jumbo is one of the best spots - Quayside, good service, good crabs. It's a welcome sight along the waterfront.
5
Satisfied with food and service in the restaurant,I'll come here again when I visit Singapore next time.
4
Generally good experience but crab can be better. Bamboo clam is awesome. and cod fish is terrible.
chilli crab & pepper crab have good taste but crab itself needs to be better.
They are short of waiters & waitresses...
4
excellant chilly crab , huge crab , nice flavour.,. but v v v v spicy
had a tough time next morning...:-)
vv v pricy...1 big crab was around 100 s $
too expensive.. better alternatives availbale.
2
This place is overly recommended. They are very busy and you feel like a number in a food court. The food is only ok. The service is pretty low and there is no ambiance at all. We were so close to the table next to us we practically had dinner with them. There was a place upstairs that was touting for business and certainly next time I go to Singapore I will try them as they probably rely on quality food and service not just reputation. This place was so highly recommended I had to go....too bad

Just took a few clients here and they all enjoyed the seafood very much. I am sure they really loved the food because they could not stop complimenting it. To me, this was a highlight of our business trip to Singapore, too. The black pepoer crab, crab soup, prawns and even fried broccoli were very delicious. Really recommend this restaurant. Having said that, the dining experience could be better if the seating was more spacious

Never have I been I so disappointed with a meal in my life. The service was terrible, had to ask multiple times for a fork, fried rice which was part of set menu came out after the dessert, table had one nut cracker, and one pick, , water was hot. I felt violated after I paid the bill. Never agai

The crab is excellent, a must eat in Singapore. The waiting queue might be one hour or more, so the fastest way to get a table is either book a few days in advance or just walk in and ask for a shared table - this will reduce the waiting time significantly.I will definitely go eat there again.one spicy crab, beer, 4 buns - for two people we paid around SGN10

I have to start by admitting that I am not a big fan of crab. But everyone says you have to try the chili crab in Singapore. So, on Election Day, I was in Clarke Quay and decided to try it at Jumbo Seafood. (I was actually looking for No Signboard but they either moved or went out of business since I was last there in 2013.)They did seat me without a reservation even though it was very busy and I was alone. The waitress was nice enough but not very helpful. I ordered the crab, broccoli stir fry with garlic (excellent) but she advised only two fried buns which were not enough. My advice would be 5 or 6.The broccoli came at least 10 minutes before the crab (but that happens in Asia) and it made a nice appetizer anyway. The crab was beautifully presented. (By the way, don’t be intimidated by the crab. It is not a whole crab that you need to smash with a hammer. It has been disassembled. What you see is the top shell over the claws and clusters.) The sauce was pretty tasty, a little less spicy than I expected and nicely messy. The crab was disappointing. It tasted all right but the meat was very hard to dislodge even from the main claw. If it were a lobster, I would say it wasn’t that fresh.Price (with tea) was over 80 Singapore Dollars which I think was high for the quality of the crab. I’ll probably try again next time I am in Singapore but not at Jumbo

Really good food. Taste the pepper crab you will love it!! It is a great place to eat in Singapour near Clarke quay

Awesome chilli crab but remember to make reservation, otherwise waste the time on waiting ! remeber ask for the size of crab before go order it.
1
Actually failed reservation with terrible service mind. It might be already no more interested in service mind.😕
5
The Chilli Crab here was EXELLENT! It goes well with buns they suggested. We also had fried rice and the small serving was pretty large.

Decided to go here for chilli crabs after recommendations from our hotel. The wait wasn't too long. We walked in and took a ticket number and waited about 30 minutes. We ordered the chilli crabs, fried rice and jug of beer (S$140). Chilli crabs were delicious!! One of the best ever. Staff were abrupt, not friendly at all so don't expect much from them. But just ignore them and enjoy your food. Also don't accept the tea and peanuts because they are not complimentary!

The seafood is ok but this is segregated dining apartheid style. We were not given an option on arrival and were seated outside. I became curious when two other western couples were urged to sit outside. When a third western couple were told after requesting inside seats that there would be quite a wait I was perplexed. I decided on a walk to the bathroom to sate my curiosity. Inside were only Singaporeans but a number of empty tables, clearly off limits to westerners
5
Amongst all the changes happening in Singapore, the quality of the Pepper Crabs at Jumbo Seafood is a constant. Absolutely delicious. We were a group of six and we also ate chilly crab with fried bun to mop up the gorgeous gravy, scallop on a yam ring, shrimp in egg yolk (we asked for the shrimp shelled), tofu (bean curd) with mushroom and a Red Snapper Hong Kong style. All wonderful but the centrepiece was the Pepper Crab washed down with ice cold Tiger. Service is quick, make sure you book ahead, the queue by the time we left on a weekday was at least 50 long by the time we left. Stay well away from the offers of Satay as starters, there are a dozen better Satay places, if that is what floats your boat. The seafood is what Jumbo are famous for, stick with their strengths and you won't go wrong

Chilli crab had just the right amount of heat. One serve of 900 gram crab, steamed rice, 2 beers and a water was S$113. Very intent on getting last orders in by 2.15 as restaurant closed at 3. Bought the bill around before we had finished and had still had ' crabby' hands. Cooler inside than out in the smokey air. No waiting for a table at 1.45 Sunday afternoon.
5
If you ever come to this restaurant don't leave without having a chilly crab. They are the best on the menu. They will even show you the crab that you want to have to check its size. but that's optional. I chose to see it first..
5
Line-up was long even on a weekday but it moved steady. If you can, reserve your table or go on odd hours to beat the crowds.Order the chili crab! Finger-lickin' good crab! I taste the freshness. Order white rice to go with the sauce because it's to die for!You do not need to order much aside from the crab. Will surely go again if I do visit Singapore again
5
The most delicious salted egg crabs i've ever tasted. The crab is massive, guess it's the mud crab type. Chilli crabs were good, but the gravy contain lots of small chunky garlic bits. Breezy environment n good food, will come back.
4
Excellent quality seafood, but at a premium price. Very popular with tourists, both for its Clarke Quay, riverside location, and the high quality local cuisine. If planning to go on a Friday or weekend, make sure you book well in advance!
5
Location is perfect, got a table with very nice view. Mood is nice, food is excellent especially the chilli crab its definitely worth the price. The service is good. Overall is a must to go restaurant especially for ocassional family dinner
4
A trip to Singapore wouldn't be complete without chilli crab and Jumbo is probably one of the best options available. Great location overlooking the river and Clarke Quay. Great chilli crab and the scallops are sweet and amazing. As with all chilli crab restaurants, send back the tea and peanuts if you don't want them as they're not complimentary (although they're handed to you as if they are). Not an overly cheap meal but definitely worth the experience and reasonable for what you get (as a couple, we had: 1x 900g chilli crab, buns, fried rice, scallops, and a few drinks = $140). Note however this could've easily fed 3 people.
5
I am not the fan of crab actually. I planned jumbo in my itinerary just for my friends. But it's surprising me with the delicious crab!!! The taste is indescribable, they are spices but make you just continue to eat!!! The mouth-feel is very very soft, you can't Imagen that is a crab!
4
My first Chili Crab was amazing. My husband and I shared the Chilli Crab for 2 - which consisted of a Set Menu of sides and included a Singapore Sling. We went just after the lunch rush and sat inside to enjoy the cool air. It was family type seating with others and enjoyed the company and the food. Definitely would recommend you try it out
4
Their speciality is the chili crab (also the wifi pw is the same as they say) though being afraid of the spices or having it too hot I had the soymilk crab instead. Fresh food, fresh prepared. Location is perfect with riverside but do not forget to book the table in advance. Not cheap. They also had some good looking desserts but was not able to eat even a bit after the crab :-
4
Had dinner there after a friend living in SG suggested this restaurant, the crab was amazing (and expensive approx 80 SGD for two) I would book in advance because the place is always full, we managed to be seated in 10 minutes but as the group gets larger it will be more difficult to find plac
5
Oh My! I never had it so good! My hosts ordered everything. I didn't know that "jellyfish salad" was so remarkable! And the bamboo clams! I could have licked the plate!Best of all was the speciality: Pepper Crab and Chili Crab. Hey, I gotta figure out how to reproduce them both because its a long way from home and I've got to have it again.Not to mention the riverwalk. The weather was hot and breezy, even in the late evening and to watch the ships docked out at sea waiting to come into port was interesting. Didn't know that Singapore is the 3rd largest shipping port in the world.2 Thumbs up
3
Do remember to book the table in advance otherwise will have to wait for long to get the table. We came here on Monday evening, and we were told in advance before we seated that we will have only 1 hour for ordering food and finishing what we order. So if you want a place to enjoy food or chatting, it is not the one. You must be rush to finish within 1 hour. I will not come back this restaurant. Food is ok
5
Not easy to find a table if you don't book before. Great location riverside near Clarke Quay. Great and huge crabs.
4
Perfectly cooked chilli crab with some fabulous side dishes .. Fresh catch and steamed to the perfection .
3
Service was not satisfied. The server is not kind to us and looks very busy
Food was delicious
So total is so so
4
Fabulous chilli crabs at this chain seafood store. No fuss minimal wait for table with efficient system to get a table of you show up without a booking. The chilli crabs were fabulous what can I say.
5
Sat outside overlooking Clarks Quay. Very laid back atmosphere, food ordered quickly but arrived at intervals which wasn't such a bad thing as there was so much to eat. Their chilli crab is to die for! Sauce very hot and spicy and plenty of it to dip in your dough balls or whatever else you want to dip in! Loved the 'bibs' you're given to wear when ordering chilli crab - we knew it was going to be messy but good fun too! A lovely place to eat to soak up the Singapore nightlife. Worth booking a table too as it was very busy, although people didn't look like they were waiting too long. Definitely worth a visit
5
Visited here with a local friend in Singapore at his recommendation. After initially being unsure I must say this place was amazing. The variety was good and the chilli crabs are the best I've had in Singapore. It's a must try restaurant along with a must try chilli crabs dish. Would surely return and recommend this place to anybody in SG
5
I recommend who ever is going to book online for a reservation. . I didn't get the chance to book a table in 2 branches but I went as walk in and waited for 15 minutes. I went to the river side branch... The food was yummy I ordered chili crab and fried rice it was great. . We ordered lobster and shrimps.. it was fine..Then we had a walk down the river sid
2
not too bad, but not good either. price much too high at sgd78 per kg plus service charge plus tax!!! that is in fact more than sgd90/kg. and they also charged for hot tea which never tell us until billed. not worth the price. beware of hidden charges
5
You can always see a line of people waiting to be seated in this restaurants, and that says it's a great place - Singaporeans like to queue for good food. And Jumbo's chilli crab is simply amazing & really worth the money. If you're sharing the meal with your friends, have some buns, rice and a drink, that should be around S$ 50 each. Also, prepare for a really messy meal! :
4
Whilst this place is a Singapore institution and very busy, it's definitely worth heading to for the chilli crab. The crab was great, the service was prompt, and the restaurant has a great vibe with staff everywhere. There are a few of these around, but the riverside unit is central and if you rock up without a reservation, you can have a drink at one of the bars in the area.
3
Not because of the food. Maybe because of the bill after dinner. Would not be very different from any other seafood restaurant you can easily find anywhere.
5
Amazing food at Jumbos and excellent service. We had our 5 month old with us and the staff were happy to accommodate us.
5
We tried fried fish, (extraordinary sour sweet taste) cereal fried prawns, duck and yes, the food here rocks! Though a little bit pricey bit you won't regret it.
5
Jumbo is one of the restaurant I always go when I am in Singapore, and it is famous for Chilli crab, actually there were many times that I flew to Singapore just because I wanted to have Chilli crab here, yes it is that good!I suggest you to make a reservation in advance as the queue could be quite long during peak hours
5
we heard from so many people about this place! there is always a crazy line on weekends so make sure to reserve a table. i have been on 2 different occasions. in terms of crabs, the black pepper crab is a safer option (and i liked it better than SG chilli crab) my sister is allergic to eggs and friend is allergic to peanuts--so the chilli crab was not good for either of them. stick with black pepper crab, spicier and more flavorful. get ready to strap on the bibs! good to go experience but its $$. if you go at peak time--they will set a timer for you to clear the table..so it can get very bus
4
Service was good and the food was excellent. Mainly seafood as you might expect. It was very hot and humid which is not unusual for Singapore. Peanuts and jasmine tea appear to be complementary but you end up paying for them (3 or 4 dollars). Next time I'll read the small print at the back of the menu
5
I went with a mate to experience the chilli crab and I was certainly not disappointed! Lots of messy fingers and a lot of sauce on my bib and I was satisfied. All washed down with an ice cold Tiger beer. Sic a great place will go back again for sure. Yum Yum
2
Recently visisted this restaurant for dinner after reading rave reviews. Although the food was good, the service was disgracefull. We had a party of six and all ordered different meals. Two meals + the rice and vegetables came out first, the other 4 meals arrived around 15 minutes later. We asked for the rice and vegetable dishes to be re-heated that took another 5 minutes. Overall very dissapointed our waitress was misarable and rude, reccomend to go to East Coast Seafood, amazing Chili & Pepper Crab and good servic
5
Jumbo is one of the most famous seafood restaurants in Singapore. We ordered a chilli crab and cereal prawns, both of which are very delicious!!!! We even ordered mantou (Chinese plain bun) and dipped them in the chilli sauce before eating!! Two tips: 1) Book a table online. This can help you jump the scarily long queue especially when you want to go there on weekends. 2) Show your SQ boarding pass. You can enjoy a 10% off with it
5
Absolutely a must if you haven't already! I had such a great time! Best to make reservations because the lines can get quite absurd.We ordered baby squid, scallops with brocolli, cheesy prawns, fried rice and but of course, chilli crab!There are other variants of how they cook their crabs but we preferred spice. And this crab didn't dissapoint! There was spice, and sauce, a lot of crab and a lot of goodness! Those claws were huge!We didn't get to enjoy the bamboo prawns which became a quick favorite the first time. Still, by the time we finished the crab and had cheesy prawns next, i could no longer take another bite... well, not after the second prawn. Creamy!Will go back the next time we get a chance! I love Jumbo
5
You should taste at least once this crab even if the queue could take and hour, it's the biggest crab ever I saw and you can take it chili, pepper or other choices, bit chili is the most famous one. Enjoy!
5
Great seafood restaurant. Make sure to be clear on whether to get shell on or off when ordering prawns. The traditional way is with the full shell on.
Crab dishes are wonderful.
4
We always long for a bite of curry crabs in Singapore.At the end, my family chose Jumbo Riverside.We ordered black pepper crabs - v delicious hot but chewy crab is juicyMy husband's favourite is the shrimp. Even the dessert is about right.Not too sweet and not too watery! A nice experience! Jumbo! Keep it on!
1
We booked for 6, the food was nice the staff were the most miserable, unhappy and rude people. When you arrive there are nuts on your table and they come around with a jug of tea and fill your glass. When the bill arrived we were charged, we should have been told they weren't complimentary. The old lady that served us should get out of the hospitality industry everything seemed toooo much trouble for her. Two of us received our meals and were finished by the time the others came, we had to ask for the rice 3 times, by the time the other meals came the rest was cold and that was a drama for her to get it heated which took another 10 minutes. Worst restaurant ever, stay clear they just want to get people in and out as fast as possible
3
Wait staff in a big hurry to get us in, pay when not finished, and get us out as quickly as possible. Food not good value with too many sauces spoiling the fresh seafood. Wait staff very pushy with ordering. Not enjoyable and would not recommend again
4
Let's start by saying that this was some of the best chilli crab I've eaten. Far from the best, certainly the most expensive and thenlacknof ambienceade me resent the price despite the quality of the meal I never booked, which I should have done, so put my name down for a table. I went for a walk, a couple of walks, went for a drink and after an hour and a half my number was called. As I approached the counter another couple jumped the queue claiming to have my number. They seated them without questioning it and then found a spot for me jammed in between two other tables. If they were going to do this anyway they could have seated me an hour earlier.Service was efficient, without the expertise of waitstaff which you might expect given the price and the wait.Food was good, no question, beer was cold and reasonably priced.I had been told when I sat down that they would give me an hour to eat, which we managed but didn't have an entree or dessert.The bill was $106, for one person, one course and two beers.Ones after the Singapore Chilli Crab experience and I guess to a degree I got it. Would I go back? No. Would I recommend? No
3
as any tourist destination, located in the heart of Clarke Quay, there is no lack of demand.This place is the epitome of that.They have no care of patron satisfaction as there 10 people behind you ready to take your place.A 19 minute reported wait turned into 2 hours.I left and came back the next day prepared.Same thing happened and when I didn't get my requested outdoor seating...they really said take it or leave it.I also got my fried rice after dessert and refused to take it off the bill.Other than these issuers the food is good and worth the experience.Just come prepared to deal with the other issues and no amount of complaining will help in this tourist trap

On our recent visit to Singapore, I wanted to experience the famous chili crab, so we went to Jumbo for an early dinner. Despite arriving at 6 pm, we still had a 30 minute wait. I'd read reviews about being charged for everything (even things they bring that you didn't order), so we avoided the peanuts, etc. We ordered one chili crab with rice and 6 mantous for the two of us. The crab was just okay. They don't give each person seafood utensils, so you're basically passing one cracker and fork back and forth. It was tedious. It's also extremely messy (fine, it's crab), but they don't have napkins! All they give you is a wet-wipe for your hands when you're done. Silly.I was really underwhelmed - it was fairly expensive for very average food. I had high expectations and they totally missed the boat. You're far better off getting some yummy (cheap!) noodles at a hawker center
3
Riverside.. .ah... nice view. Especially at night. Wanted to have dinner with friend with nice view. Well, this place would do.However, the order do take a while to turn up, even for drinks. Just too crowded, and may have to queue for a table.As popular and signature dish, the chilli crab. Well, more like sweet more than chilli for the gravy.The rest, well, just so s
3
We visited for a recommended meal by the river. The sevice from from the start was shocking the drinks took too long to arrive and the food came out at different times. Although the food was tasty (chilli crab and peppered crab), it was quite expensive. These two are famous dishes which need trying whilst in Singapore.
4
chilicrab was so fantastic.
but too expensive.
chilicrab 1.3kg(sri), buns(4), and cereal shirimp 's cost was 150 SGD. (for 2)
4
The meals were all excellent. The view was also good to see. You can book using a good system that can call your phone number using programme.
3
Chili crab was not piping hot. Server just brought the soup but never served. I ordered the deep fried fish but was served the steam version instead.
2
We got this place recommended. The food is ok, but price is too high compared to quality!
Nice manager at the restaurant, however rest of the staff were rude.
Too many people - and we don't understand why, because food was really plain!
4
The food is good but comparing to the price I think it is too expensive. The taste of each menu are as follows;- Chili Crab is good and fresh. - Stir fried sambal with kangkong is nice. - Crab fried rice is neutral. - Fried prawn with cereal is ok.In overall, I satisfy with this meal. 
3
If this is the Jumbo Restaurant at Clarke Quay, we were left with a feeling that the locals get much better service than the tourists. First was a nice surprise to find there is an air-conditioned restaurant behind the tables outside, but we were somewhat crammed in and did notice the people around us got much better service than ourselves. The food that was received was bit better than average it was ruined by one dish not arriving, although we think there was expectations that we wait and pay for it. Yes, we were fed and it was OK, but like some of the other reviewers had experienced, there is no reason to go back
1
A one hour wait. Indifferent service. Noodles arrived after six requests thirty minutes after the order - because they were "from a different department". All accompanied by a cockroach running across the floor - not the restaurant's fault admittedly - but pretty well summed up the experience. Awful
4
Went there for a Birthday Celebration. Asked for crabs to be reserved but they did not do such a reservation nor reply or say anything about the reservation. However the staff was nice enough to let us know that a fresh batch of crabs has arrived and asked if we would like to reserve the only 2 1.4kg crabs available before we proceed with any other orders. No weighing of crabs were done in front of us. The food were overall great but the experience were marred by certain issues. There were a lot of flying insects in the enclosed air-conditioned restaurant which, when we mentioned to the staff, they were unable to do anything about. The insects were landing on the tables, plates and utensils. Not very pleasant nor sanitary... Not something which we expected to see in a relatively expensive seafood restaurant. We ordered a small horfun but for some reason, they gave us a medium one. We didn't know until I was telling my family that this was a small horfun, the serving staff overheard me and corrected me saying that it was a medium one. The 2 kids had water but we were charged 2 additional tea for them. We didn't asked for the snacks (peanuts etc.) but were charged for them as well. The seats were too close to the other tables and for some reason, they decided to put the extra seats in the middle of the restaurant amidst the 4 big tables. Obviously, since we were the last family to arrive at 12.30pm, the seats were pushed away from the other tables, too close to ours! When we asked about the removal of the extra seats as our family members sitting there would be very cramped, the staff was blur (confused) and did not do anything. It doesn't help that one table had big-sized guests whose chairs were pushed far back and our entire space was limited and cramped. One of the lady staff noticed this (good service and pro activeness here) and helped us to pull our table further away. As mentioned, the food is still good so it helps if you are not bothered by all these issues mentioned.
3
Food was alright. Came here for lunch to have chili crab as it is a national dish. Ordered that and a few other dishes, after being seated at a shared table, not uncommonly at Chinese/Asian restaurants. Service was alright. One of the servers came by to ask if we wanted anything else as the kitchen was closing. The food was fine if not spectacular. Maybe it's the dish, but I was expecting more wow with regards to the chili crab.
3
Jumbo is famous for its chilli crab and it is delicious, but that's all it really does have to offer. We tried the cod, fried rice, and mango with roasted duck salad and they were underwhelming. The service is not horrible, but not great either. It is very busy so your servers do tend to forget about you and your food. If you have more than 4 people, reservations are recommended or else you will be waiting for at least 30-45 minutes. Once you are seated they ask that you finish in one hour because the table is reserved for the next time slot. I wouldn't exactly call this place fine dining, but it does have the price of fine dining
3
The staff were unfriendly. The food comes late.. And expensive food value.
Too crowded and many people, it is difficult to recommend it to others.
3
You easily spend over 100 dollars per person and the food is only ok and the customer service is incredibly horrible. Not recommended
1
This restaurant serves at the menu soup shark fin and participates at the same time to the extinction of sharks in our oceans. Do not eat this soup and let them know.
5
Great food. Great atmosphere. Obviously very popular as it seems to be full mostly. Chillie crab was fantastic. Service was good. Little pricey but most places on the river seem to be.
5
It is true. I thought this was going to be overrated but it turned out to be better than I had hoped. Mouth watering chilli crab, delicious noodles and deep fried sweet buns was more than enough for 2. But we spoke to locals sitting next to us & they were having a crab each and several other dishes! We booked and happy we did as there wasn't a seat spare and a queue of hopefuls! I am still dreaming of that chilli crab and the day I get back to Jumbos! Good for couples or groups. As long as you book ahead you won't miss out. All their restaurants are good.
5
If you wanna try a mouthwatering Singaporean style crab then you should go for Jumbo's chili crab, its out of the world!! You should try their bamboo clams with lemon and garlic as a starter (outstanding), shrimps with pumpkin puree (delicious n sweet). You shouldn't miss their seafood fried rice, and their stir fry spinach salad with oyster sauce and garlic.
5
Everything tasted great. Particularly the prawns with the fried cereal coating them!! Also the curry and pepper crabs are amazing. Really want to go back. Well, I WILL go back if I go to Singapore again.. mind you there are a few locations of the restaurants.. so if you are meeting someone, ask which location it is
3
First time at this Jumbo outlet but upon arrival the service was consistently horrid. Staff are unwilling to serve us and purposely ignoring us (hoping their colleagues be the ones who are doing the work). For instance, It was so difficult to place our orders, waiter kept forgetting our bowls of rice (she said it is on the way but it didn't come till 10mins later upon us asking another waiter).Surprisingly the food is still pretty good and was on par to the East Coast outlet.Will not come back again thanks to the bad service
4
Was told they are the ones to introduce the dish. Even if they aren't, a dinner with your loved one is a must do here. The chilly crab with their fried rice is a good meal for two and very satisfying to the tummy and soul.This is situated in Clarke Quay across the Singapore river and the view is breath taking. The place is definitely expensive. A meal for two costed us a good 130 Singapore dollars but i would sum up as an experience worth trying
4
I took dinner here with friends from my company. We must make reservation first. We ordered set of menu. Best way to try all the seafood they have. Prawn, crab, soup, fish, everything was excellent. The location near the Clarke Quay, it has a river view. Nice place for dinner
4
Good food, but not worth the LONG wait! Make sure you book in advance and you really like Sri Lanka crab or else it will be an expensive experience.
2
Had to book in advance for a seat, waiting time was minimal since we had a booking. Food quality was not too bad, however i do feel that it's overpriced. Some hawker food taste way better for less.
5
Very Excellent, Chiili Crab is very good taste. service is very excellent. I will go back again next time.
3
We ate here on our last day in Singapore, and this was the only time during our whole trip where we were let down by the quality of the waiting staff.We arrived just after a busy lunch service (we had made a reservation) but stood around waiting for someone to assist us with a table. After 5 minutes, we finally sat down and were offered some Chinese Tea. I declined, but was not offered anything else (water perhaps?). Finally, water came about 10 minutes later when we were given our menus.We ate the crispy squid, black pepper crab, and some chicken fried rice. All delicious. The black pepper crab was simply amazing.When the bill came, I noticed the charge for the Chinese Tea and I questioned it - it was not complimentary, despite it being offered without a disclaimer. When I questioned the charge, it was not removed.Furthermore, I had to go into the back of the restaurant to pay with my credit card (they insisted they did not accept Visa...) so I had to pay with my Mastercard, meanwhile, the finance assistant shouted at me because I questioned this.Its unfortunate, as the food was so good, but I cannot stand bad customer service in the restaurant industry, and this place sucked
4
There are 2 Jumbos around Clarke Quay - One is right at the river side which is more open and the view is better, good to go with client / foreigners. The other one is at this Upper Circular Road which is indoor and it is less crowded in terms of seating but usually serves 3 rounds everyday (6:00 - 7:30, 7:30 - 9:00, 9:00 onward)......Anyway both serve the same food with same high standard. Itâ€™s the place to go for chilli crab, black / white pepper crab / egg yolk crab, Booking is needed. On you arrival you be lucky if seated within in mins. The service is extremely fast, the waiter would bring things out to the table such has peanuts, tea and wet towels. Note they are not FREE; They charge you for it so if you don't want, just politely say no and refused the nuts and whatever they put on your table without you asking. The food was good; DEFINITELY order the black pepper crab if you like spicy food. It was out of this world, may I say that the black pepper crab its only done right in Singapore. The free Wi-Fi! Is a plus
5
Decided we'd try a restaurant that seemed to attract locals & we were more than happy that we did. Although we had to wait to be seated at a shared table it was well worth it. We selected a variety of different dishes & enjoyed every one. The locals at our table were very welcoming & we had a great time chatting with them. Overall a memorable experience 1 that we will revisit next time we're back
4
Looking for good regional cuisine in a hectic but unrushed environment? What to expect at Jumbo...Food: Tried the signature Chili Crab and a few appetizers. All freshly prepared and tasty if not spectacular. No complaints from us.Service: Efficient if not super-friendly service. Menus had pictures which helped. Also helped to have a native Chinese speaker in the party. Location: Convenient in the heart of the downtown core. Nice outside and noisy inside seating with air conditioning. price: Reasonable for the quality food.Not sure if this chain is authentically Singaporean, but the food was good and the location is worth a visit

I had a reservation a week before dine in at Jumbo Seafood Riverside. Better to get your reservation earlier to avoid disappointment. Unfortunately, i cannot get the reservation timing for dinner hours. So i had it at 9.45pm as my late dinner. The must order dishes definitely goes to Chilli crabs. very fresh crabs king served and not forgetting the chilli gravy. it was very tempting and dip more with the fried bun. I also ordered another side dish - scallop with fried yam. It was a very good dish as well. Overall, i enjoyed very much to dine in here. Good food, good price, good night scenery. After the late dinner, we still able to walk around at riverside-Clarke Quay, there are a lot of bars to opt for second round. :

My fourth visit there with family. The signature chilli crab was much spicier than our previous visits, so much so that we could not enjoy the sauce anymore.Even non-seafood dishes were priced quite unreasonably. Bill was $500, really not worth the food itself, but the service was good (except we had wanted to dine at normal time, but no choice so we had to make a reservation for 5:30pm and were asked to leave the table by 7:15pm).Would not recommend except for the tourist experience

Chilli Crab is one of Singapore's most known dish, and it was nothing but amazing to have it in Jumbo Seafood. Crab is big and juice, the sauce is out of this world, dip some bun in it or pour over your rice. Remember to make reservation, otherwise the wait can be very long

chili crab is good and delicious. must be try again when back to singapore. also, the view is good if sitting next to river.
4
I love Jumbo's and had been to some other locations. This one had a very simple atmosphere for the top dollar pricing. Area was not what I expected for all the hype about Clark Quay. Food and service were good though.
3
Known as the best restaurant for chilli crab, and crowded with people wanting to sample this delight, I was extremely disappointed. Not a hint of chilli but instead a sickly sweet dish I could only have one mouthful before putting down my cutlery. The starter of lobster salad was also a disappointment. Tiny portion and little flavour.Cheap food though and great location
4
The place is packed, which is usually a good sign. The food was excellent. The crab is good but I liked the various starters even better and you will need them as there is not much meat in a crab. The riverside is nice for a walk after dinner.

Superb chilli crab and mantou (steamed buns). Very very popular so try to book in advance.The fantastic experience of demolishing a whole (sri lankan) crab and getting so messy during the process is just so enjoyable. Staff are very pushed as it is so popular but most are ok - for me especially Andrew a line manager who moved my table from the rain and was very attentive throughout. So good I went twic

We went there since we didnt know what to eat in Clarke Quay area during our holiday. The place was super bussy with many people waiting. I know, we should have booked a table before. But we waited for 45minutes :) Although the place is so bussy, I can see that the waitress all were trying its best accomodating the people' need. We asked the waiter what the best they had, but apparently English might not be the universal language in this restaurant. Well, we finally ordered: chili crab (really recomended), black pepper crab, cereal fried prawn, caramel pork ribs, and seafood fried rice. Conclusion? REALLY NICE!!Despite the long queue, we enjoyed our food, especially the chili crab and the prawn. The crab is sweet, the sauce tastes just right and yummy. Not so much egg, though. But we enjoyed it.The prawn, we felt that it is fresh and fried well (not oily, but crispy). I recomend you to book the table in advance if you want to go there :) Good joob Jumbo

My caveat with this review is that I have no comparison as this was the first time I'd ever had chili crab. We were taken out for dinner here by a local couple who told us that they'd been to this restaurant multiple times.Everything was delicious...chili crab, black pepper crab, Malay noodle dish, drunken shrimp in broth, the mini buns, morning glory veggies, and the deep fried baby octopus.We were lucky to sit indoors and even that was HOT!Additionally we were lucky to have locals with us because they were able to communicate with the servers in Chinese (due to limited English) to get our plates refreshed, more napkins, refills, etc
1
Arrived, shown to a table. 10 minutes later a surly waitress asked what drinks we wanted - 1 came in 5 minutes, the other 10 minutes after requesting it. 20 mins further on still no food order placed although we signalled politely for attention. Another 10 minutes went by and we gave up. Left after speaking with two servers and manager as the place was far from full. Won't bother returning as prices were hiked up anyway and plenty of other restaurants to choose from
4
We had booked a riverside table 3 days in advance, and had it confirmed, but when we checked in they had no record of the booking. They eventually found us a table on the terrace, but not where we had intended to be, and we had limited time as it was booked for someone else later.However, the seafood is just lovely, and sitting out on the terrace at sunset, with all the lights coming on is magic.Very busy restaurant, but quick service (they try and turn around the tables as fast as possible)
4
There's a few things you need to know about this place to before you go to avoid disappointment 1. It's super busy! So if you haven't reserved a table well in advance you will have to wait. Suggest putting your name down asking how long it will be & then going & having a drink overlooking the river at the Swissotel Merchant Court. We went for a shared table which meant we got seated quicker - it was totally fine, the table fit 10 & we only shared it with a family of 4 (we were a couple).2. The nuts & tea are not complementary. When we dined they offered both (they weren't on the table waiting like a lot of people mention - not sure if this was because the tables were turning over quickly or because of the feedback). You only need to say no & they move on.3. The chilli crab is awesome & filling. We had a 900g crab with 4 fried buns & a small seafood fried rice (which tastes awesome with the chilli crab sauce!) and both my husband & I were full. 4. You need to order the fried buns with the crab - they do not automatically come with the dish but are a tasty addition.5. The Singapore slings are not worth having - cheap but sickly sweet. Go with wine or Tiger beer instead.6. Relax & have a good time. :-
5
If you do one thing in Singapore come here and eat the Chilli Crab! It is absolutely amazing. The service was decent, however I would recommend making a booking as we had to wait around half an hour before being served. A must!
5
When all the locals are there you know its good and at least reasonable in price.Great portions and views make it a great dinner spot. Suggestion: don't wear white
4
Rather touristy, being in the centre, but its also used by lots of locals.Its very busy, so youll need to book.fantastic variety of seafood.local speciality is chilli crab, but eveything we tried was lovely. Its not cheap.
3
Staff here are very stern and you won't find a smile with any of them. I stayed in Singapore for three nights and it seems that most restaurants just don't put effort into "welcoming" you but just stick people into their seats and rush you to order.We tried both the chilli and black pepper crab. Chilli crab was average and the meat not as juicy as I expected. The sauce of the black pepper version just completely overpowers the whole crab and you end up tasting salty mush. Overpriced, and if not for some friends saying you must try this in Singapore, I'd probably wouldn't come here
3
Excellent black pepper and chilli crabs, albeit overpriced, as is the case at all the locations of the three Singapore leading crab chains (Jumbo, Long Beach, and No-Signboard). You can have equally good crabs at lower prices at more obscure locations (near Changi, Geylang), but it's not fab to eat messy crab in a drab environment. Most other items (eg. garlic razor clams, spinach and mushroom tofu, too sweet cereal prawns, or even the crab fried rice) are definitely less good than at many restaurants elsewhere in Singapore. Being in a prime tourist location, it's always full and the waiters are trained to rush you out
4
we had some guests in town and thought of jumbo at riverside. initially there was some confusion with reservations but once we were settled in, we ordered our food - sri lanka crab decent size 1.5kg in chili sauce. dont go anything smaller or bigger. remember to order the mantou - fried or steamed. the bamboo clams in garlic were good and tasty. fried mee goreng noodles singapore style is quite good as well
5
Can't get enough of Jumbos amd if you're not sure about some reviews them ask yourself why is it always packed to the ceiling - not with tourists but mainly residents getting their tried and tested, much-loved crab fix. The sauce is the best anywhere on the island especially with the little buns to dip in. I don't think you can reasonably call the, on their service when they even bring you a bag for your smartphone not to get sticky (although the national obsession is getting a bit tedious). Love a nice cold pitcher of beer and the house wine is decent and a good price -for Singapore. Sometimes found they don't have any left though. Join for $20 and get 20% discount plus a $100 dollar no strings attached birthday voucher
3
well, the chilly crab was good, starters as well. Nice location, a bit too rushed service, felt a bit like on a conveyor. booking in advance is a must, and don't drink wine, really stick to soft drinks and beer (think they had a batch that went off or something)
2
We went for the signature Chili Crab that was very tasty and met all expectations. However, the service was atrocious. We went on a Saturday afternoon around 1.00pm It was as if the staff couldn't wait to clear the restaurant quick enough so they could prepare for the evening sitting. We were mid-way though our meal around 2.30pm when a waiter came around waving everyone's bill expecting them to pay at the table. A guest next to us, who had crab sauce all over his hands, had to stop eating, wipe his hands, and pay the account. Another couple, the other side of us, who were first time visitors, had to wait an hour for their meal. When it arrived, the waiter wanted then to pay the bill. They were very disappointed. This was a reasonably expensive meal. Two chili crabs and a couple of beers was SGD 200. For so called fine dining this was a very disappointing experience. We had much better experiences in Chinatown eating street food. Would not recommend this restaurant if you are after friendly service. Staff were also very in-attentive
2
Obviously you have to have chilli or black pepper crab when you come to Singapore and everyone tells you that Jumbo are the best which is why I went - had to scratch that itch.Well, I can say that I have done that but I won't be going back. They basically know that they have a product with demand and they treat you like sheep herding you into pens and tables. The service is very robotic with everything done to timing and to a very specific procedure so take care if you want anything that may upset their 'standard' way of doing things (the give-away are the headsets that the staff wear like in a McDonalds or other fast food joint were it is turnover rather than attention to detail that drives the corporate nature of the franchise). English does not seem to be high up on the agenda of employing staff.Anyway, had the set menu, got served by a robot, the bill was more than I thought and the crab was over-hyped - not much of it and I've had better. Oh and it was messy. Very messy
5
The best crab ever , i do prefer black pepper crab. Fresh, sweet, good aroma. I gonna come here soonest
4
The restaurant is usually crowded, so try to make a reservation. The food is excellent. Try both the chilli crab and the pepper crab. These are very good choices. Otherwise, most of the selections will be well prepared and very good.
4
Jumbo serves very fresh and good seafood. Best seafood restaurant that I've tried and been there several times. But its a little expensive. Better to make reservations.
5
My daughter is only 4 years old, I'm afraid of the spicy food, then the waiter recommended a fried crab with spiced salt, and my daughter liked it very much！
4
There isn't a better place to try the famous Singapore Chilly Crab. Jumbo lived up to its name as far as the taste was concerned. However its hospitality may be worth considering. They are very strict on timelines. We didn't know we had to specifically mention about the bread basket to be served with the crab. The staff never prompted to serve it either. By the time we realized we had hit the 3:00 pm deadline and we were left with a pot full of crab and curry with no bread. You might want to try frog legs with fried ginger and cereal fired prawns. Food was absolutely scrumptious but for the bread :)
3
A group is colleges and I went to jumbo and we were really lucky that within 15 min they let us know that the table was ready.We had chili crab, it's not too hot, has the right amount of chili, so good! Other the buns!! So you can dip them in the chili crab source.One crab should be good for 2 plus an appetizer. So if you don't mind to be rushed while eating this is a place to go. They want you to finish fast so they can allocate new clients
4
Had a lot of people say to us when they found out we were going to Singapore that we had to go to Jumbo RiverfrontTook the suggestionMade a Booking the night before happy i did this place does get busy Good service very attentive went with the Chilli crab but could have chosen another 5 or 10 dishes they all look fantasticThe crab arrived and didn't disappoint Rich and full of flavour Finished up with a Mango pudding This place would be god with a group you could all order something different and try more dishe
5
We ate five dishes between two of us which of course is a lie. We TRIED to eat five dishes but failed! The king prawns were monsters and absolutely fresh. Such a difference from frozen. The grouper was very good and beautifully served. The scallops were also excellent as was the mixes seafood with noodles. The Singapore Crab is the trademark and did isn't disappoint. We had a huge crab and were stuffed like pigs by the end. My advice? Order less food than we did! But don't miss it. It's really excellen
4
For those who do not have much time to spend in the city nor the time to research into the millions of restaurants available this is a good choice. Nice to sit down at the riverside and a fun experience to try the chilli crab. Not cheap but one crab weighing over 1kg should be enough for two without the need for any other dishes. Agree that service is a little rushed but it's a fast turnover restaurant. I personally think shellfish like crab/lobster is best eaten as they are but the chilli crab was a tasty experience
1
This restaurant specialises in crab, but does not do other seafood well. We had the baby crispy squid which had the texture of uncooked prawn crackers. Inedible. The king prawns with egg were overcooked and the egg sauce poured over it made the deep fried batter turn to mush. The Asian greens with mushroom was also a disappointment. The greens had been boiled to the point that they were unrecognisable and (ironically) the mushrooms were only just cooked.We were also charged for the small bowl of peanuts that were on the table - that we ate only because we waited 20 minutes before our order was taken.The small bowl of rice that we were assured was part of our order, never arrived.We ate very little and left hungry after paying a not inconsiderable bill.NOT THE EXPERIENCE I WAS LOOKING FOR IN SINGAPORE
5
I' ve booked the seat before 1 months, so I didn' t need to wait. The atmosphere is good and the waitress are helpful. We ordered the set, totoal abt. $190(Inc.the service fee) How delicious!!! It' s worth to try it!
4
decent view, nice chillicrab! and the cute napkin is worth taking a pic with the crab u order. However, the service is slightly disappointing. some staff need to learn how to smile and deal with customers who have been waiting for long!
4
Been here numberous times in 2004-2012 period, and wanted to enjoy it again during a 2015 visit to Singapore. The food is still great. Chili crab and lobster never get you bored, and the cook knows the recipes well. The food is GOOD, but we needed to focus on the food. The restaurant is at a top location in Clarke Quay, but there are a few too many tables on just not enough square meters. Plenty of staff, but running around like headless chickens. Despite our reservation, we were urged to finish in 90 minutes. Foods and drinks were served in a hurry. After removing the last used plate the bill was presented. We did not need to ask for it. In short: the food is impressive and a must-do for sea food lovers. Service at the table is so-so, limited to get-your-order, here's-the-food and here's-the-bill
4
This is quite centrally located and very very busy place. You would need a reservation to get place here. We had booked the room which allowed a very private dinner. Service I must say was excellent. They have a decent wine list of beers and wines. Though it is limited to that with a few whisky and brandy
4
we were fortunate to get a table. Fully booked online, but waited in the line ( for all of 1 minute) and got a table for two ( provided we were out within 90 mins). No problem, the hot chili crab arrived quickly followed by cereal prawns, scallops in yam baskets and some tofu and veg. All excellent. Not cheap as all the reviewers remark, but the service was efficient and the food consistent.
4
First of all, amazing crabs. Not too spicy, just enough to make it interesting. Great sauce that come with it, it was a mouth watering experience. But, what really let me down is the staff's attitude. They never smiled once, and when my dad ordered a second drink, they didn't bring it up until dessert. But I guess all this was because of the huge number of people come in to this restauran
3
This Singapore chilli crab restaurant was highly recommended by our local friends so we had to try it. I must say there were many tourists here and the service is sorely lacking. Their attitude is also something that needs improvement as well. The chili crab itself was pretty good, very unique and we had never tasted before. I may be back again if we crave crab. Our friends mentioned that their prices is somewhat pricey for this local dish
4
Took the family here for dinner on our last night in Singapore and the food was delicious. Chilli crab is a must in Singapore, and this one was no exception. However i felt it, as well as the other dishes, were a little overpriced. Good views of the river and the atmosphere is great.
3
We ate at this restaurant one evening - the Chili crab is delicious, the sauce is outstanding. It is in a lovely location along the river.Unlike restaurants in other countries where you are given hours to eat you are given 90 minutes to eat in this restaurant. We were served a multi (10+) course meal for 12 people. Due to the time limit the food was quickly brought in then quickly removed. The staff never smiled or spoke a friendly word. It is very busy with lots of movement and lots of noise. At the end of our 90 minutes the manager came by the ask why we had not signed the credit card slip. We told him because we were still waiting on our card. He promptly returned with the card and without an apology. The road outside is very busy and cabs do not like to stop. Our cab driver yelled at us and said he would get a ticket for stopping. I am sure there are much nicer restaurants in this lovely country
4
Easy access from anywhere on the island, make reservations or be prepared to wait - this place is packed. If you've never had chili crab, you are in for a messy treat. There are many, many tasty dishes here. Good service for a really busy, crowded spot. The river view is very nice.
4
It was a pleasant experience, except the waitress wasn't very nice. She was really impatient when she took our order, even though there weren't many customers.
1
Avoid this place at all costs. We had two pitchers of beer, two two crabs, an order of Tofu and were charged $495 USD
3
We visited here to have chilli crab (as an experience). It was quite expensive (over $175) for 3 of us.
While we had heaps of food, it was very busy and we sat outside. Both my husband and son were very unwell afterwards.
4
We had the pepper chilly crab, nice and tasty. The service was great and the staff were very attentive to change plates regularly. but I thought was a bit excessive but the food was nice and for a special occasion it was ok. The location outside was great by the river. you have to reserve half -day before you eat there, since the place is full crowded
4
We came here after a 12 hour flight when we arrived in Singapore after reading a few reviews and knew that we did not want to think about where to eat after landing. We were happy that we booked and did not have to wait in line for a table. The food was good and we enjoyed our chilli crab, scallops, prawns etc. Service was good for u
4
A nice location down from Clarke Quay. The food is very good quality, we had octopus and of course the chilli crab, the restaurants signature dish. I do feel that the portions were huge, we ordered far too much and no one told us. Usually I'd expect the waiter to tell you where you're going wrong.That said, we thoroughly enjoyed the food and atmosphere. I would definitely book next time and get a better table outside with a view of the river.The downside is the price, it is pricey and for what I'd usually expect to pay around £80 at home we got a bill for £120 for two of us and I don't think that was just over ordering. It doesn't put me off going again, just order smaller and book a seat before I go
1
Need I say more? If you enjoy sitting in a noisy place with babies and a waiter who could care less about service - this is the place for you. Your experience will start with smile-less Host. If your nice, they'll seat you inches away from a table bussing station
5
I have to visit jumbo seafood whenever i visit Singapore to Enjoy their signature Singaporean Chilli Crab, but you should becareful because their crab can cause addiction !! It's mouthwatering deliciously addictive. In addition, you should try their bamboo clams with garlic, some noodles, and definately their fried vegetable rice. Dont miss it and be aware that queuing can take a full hour, so i would advise you to go to Clarke Quay branch since you can walk around the river until tour turn comes. Enjoy!
4
We loved our meal here! of course, we came for the chili crab, but also had the steamed buns and the crispy squid - all three of these were true highlights. We got the salted prawns which were a little soggy compared to what I have had before.Service was a little slow - we had to flag people down from time to time.but definitely a wonderful first night spent in Singapore, and a great introduction the food in this amazing city
4
We had the pepper chilly crab abd the regular chilly crab, both were nice and tasty. The service was great and the staff were very attentive to change plates regularly. we had steamed rice and kankung and prawns For the five of us we paid about 400 Sing dollars which I thought was a bit excessive but the food was nice and for a special occasion it was ok. The location outside was great by the river
5
We are happy for the good service and easy internet reservasion.
We are very enjoy with the chili crab, it's so wonderful dish ever.
Also very nice atmosphere at the Singapore river.Thank you.
5
Chillii crab was really tasteful and value to money! It is highly recommended for everyone. Sitting outside was the good experience as it was cozy atmosphere. We were enjoying the river view and hearing the lived music from somewhere.
4
Came here for dinner with friends , great service , great atmosphere , fabulous menu and delicious as ever.Recommend to all .
4
taste was really good
but servive was really terrible.
very slow. ignore my call when I need something.
5
I love the chili crab and the shrimps!
They are delicious!
4
We walked up 10 minutes before they opened and got a table right away - the food was delicious although the chili crab is overrated - expensive, and just OK. But everything else we ordered was great. Service was a bit slow but maybe it was just because it is so crowded
4
Gorgeous peppered crab. Service ok but not the best. but food amazing. Nice views onto the river and surroundings drinks were plenty but service again slow with this had to keep asking for my drinks. Very busy place toilets clean so it's worth a go Deffo for crab lush
5
I made the reservation 1 month before going to Singapore. There was someone with me, but she canceled in the last minute. So I went to Singapore by myself.I set it as the perfect ending of my travel in SG, and it really was!!!Due to I'm alone, I only ordered the chilli crab, and two bread.Both the source and the crab meat are very good, a little sweet in the chilli. I will definitely go there again and try more
3
My friend and I visited this restaurant as it features in every guide book so we thought it must be something special. We booked about 1 month before our visit to Singapore and were pretty excited about trying it. We arrived just before our reservation time and to put it politely the 'meet and greet' system was mayhem. There was a huge queue and not much preference seemed to be given to people who had booked more to people who were pushy! After 20 minutes waiting we decided to be pushy. We were grudgingly shown to a table inside which was cramped and way too close to the next table, obviously advance booking does not give access to tables overlooking the river! None of the tables had a reserved sign which is bad practice as the queue of people with reservations was a long one.The food when it came was excellent. We decided against the Chilli Crab because nobody seemed to be able to tell us how much we would end up paying for it, a lot of the pricing was not transparent! Drinks were harder to get hold of and we had to ask 3 times for our glasses of wine. The atmosphere is this restaurants downfall, it feels rushed, cramped and chaotic and you get the feeling the customer and the dining experience are both unimportant.Would I return? Never!!! The person who owns this venue has dollar signs in their eyes and demonstrates little concern for their customers or their overworked staff
4
Touristic place where you can taste the Singapore famous Chili crab. There are set menus for different amount of people that range from 50 to 70 SDG per person, which tells you about restaurant price, it is expensive but food and product quality is quite good. I have not eaten Chili crab in other venue and cannot compare, the one we had was perfecty cooked and Chili sauce was delicious.Expensive but recommended, probably to go onc
3
we came at 10.30pm, but then we still have to wait until the other table done, so we kindda eating very fast because the restaurant closed at 00.00.
Cereal prawn tastes really good. the others are average. price should not be too high
2
Taste and atmosphere was very good.
But Restaurant employees is too unkind.
Especially, for visitors
3
We ate here after many recommendations to enjoy some chili crab while in Singapore. The locale is great with a nice view of the river. The chili crab was pretty good, though you'll spend more energy trying to get at the meat that you actually get from it. In general the food here is rather pricey. but satisfying.Where the establishment fell short was the service. It was slow and one dish actually arrived after we had finished everything else. Also, it took a wile to get the bill. In fact, I almost concluded must have been a free meal
4
The restaurant is really popular therefore crowded but we could not feel it on the service which was quite fast, after the order everything came smoothly. Unfortunately I could not try the most famous food, the chili crab, but I succeeded to get for dinner gluten free food, steamed shrimps and vegetables, everything was delicious, I really enjoyed the dinner in this restaurant. I recommend to take the celiac travel card with you or if you have a local person he/she can support to explain your requirements
4
Went here on workmates recommendation. Did not book and had to wait in the "walk-in" holding area for a vacant table. Only had to wait 20 minutes. Our table staff were efficient and got us extra plates/napkins as requested. The food was tasty and plenty. We were given a time that we had to be finished as the table was pre booked but we had over 2 hours to eat our meal. Will go back on next visit to Singapore, but will book so we can sit outside
2
It was my wifes birthday and i wanted to make it a special visit. I called to make a reservation the person couldnt understand english and was very rude on the phone the restaurant was full so was told to show up and try my luck. We decided to show up and try our luck. After waiting for 30 minutes wait we were finally seated as we were being taken to the table we were told that we would have a limited time to eat our food since the table is reserved for a later seating. (i have never faced such a situation) The food was ordered and came and what a dissappointment. Tasted like ketchup and chilli crab. one of the worse crabs i have ever had. Dont plan on going back. They need to work on client building for management and wait staff alik
4
A nice place to eat variety of seafood dishes. At night you can also watch the nearby sea with lightings from many ships. However, if you're a budget traveler, I don't recommend it as it could be very expensive. By saying this I don't mean I was a rich traveler myself. I just gave myself a chance.
4
Finally decided to try the chilli crab and didn't regret the choice. Yes it can be pricey if you go seafood fiesta and ordered all the fancy fishes and seafood. But there are other items on the menu available to accompany the chilli crab, and they are just fine. Overall, it's worth the money compared to most of other fancy looking restaurants on Clarke Quay/ riverside area. The crab was fresh, the sauce is finger licking good. We ordered mantau (bun) and basically scrapping every drop of the sauce left on the dish because it was too good
5
We had heard great reviews of this restaurant from friends who had visited Singapore and so we booked online in advance. What a fabulous meal this was. Even though on the more expensive side, it is definitely worth eating here and we will definitely return next time we are in Singapore
4
Long queue before we finally get a seat. We didn't make a reservation,as we just decided not the spot while we met our friend. About half an hour wait, and it is worth a wait. We ordered the famous chilli crab, some people may not like it, as the "chilli" not actually taste spicy, but more into sweet (personal opinion). We ordered additional mantau/mini bun to dip into the sauce, was delicious. We also ordered salted egg prawn, taste was average, you can get it same flavour elsewhere. The tofu and mixed mushroom was great. The highlight is the crab, asked the waiter to cater how many person you dine with. Service could be better, one waiter accidentally drop crab claw with sauce in it while she clearing our table. It just unprofessional. Definitely expect some quality of service
4
the set A on the menu is delicious.
But the crab is a little bit spicy.
And I love the dessert (sago)!
4
Good locations unfortunately these common and famous restaurant in Singapore are always very noisy and sometimes long waiting. Lucky we booked before!
Good service from staff and the food specially the crab is among the best.
4
Nice food, nice view. Tasty pepper crab. We arrived 30min earlier than our reservation time, but the restaurant could not arrange table for us earlier. Seems not flexible enough.
4
This resturant serves really delicious food (known for its chilli and pepper crab) in a relaxing setting near the water at Clarke Quay. The service is good, but not exceptional. However, it has a fast turn over - if you are waiting a table...wait time is not too long. To avoid this, book a place or get to the resturant at opening times. It is not cheap, but affordable. I am sure, you will leave satisfied. Jumbo Seafood Riverside is situated in amongst many other restaurants and close to Clarke Quay Shopping Centre. Hence, it is easily accessible from anywhere in Singapore. Enjoy
3
The Chili crab lived up to its fame, the sauce is delicious. I recommend ordering lots of the bread, we only got two and they are tiny! Also ordered the seafood fried rice which was very light, didn't taste oily like most others. The article on the other hand is horrible. Waiters can barely speak English and they shove the bill in ur face at 2:15 on the dot. Our hands were all messy, in the middle of our meal they made us stop and pay. We could not order bread, water, nothing after that. Poor business on their part and poor service for clients. Everyone around us was also pretty outraged.
3
We arrived as walk in customers around 8.30pm on a Tues night. It looked busy and we were told we had a 45 min wait.We decided to wait and within 5 mins they advised that there had been a cancellation and would we mind to share a big table with other diners.We didn't mind at all and were grateful not to wait. We sat down and had tea offered to us and also peanuts put in front of us. We drank the tea but skipped the nuts as there was simply no time to eat them as our food came out very fast.We're were later charged for the tea and the nuts even though we assumed they were included in the price by the way they had been offered to us. I was annoyed at this as it was not a cheap meal and I believe they inferred that these items were free.We chose set menu A for 2 people at S$138 ++ as we wanted to try the chilli crab. The food was all very nice and really the quantity was way too much for 2 people.We asked a few times for extra napkins and plates to put the shells in and also an extra pair of crab crackers and pick as we only got one to share between 2 people.Anyway, all the extra things came in the end but I feel the serving staff could be more gracious. They seem run off their feet and simply sick of serving.The food was good, but for the price, you need to complement that with making customers feel special. We didn't feel that. Ir was more like 'Order, eat, pay, get out

I went to Jumbo many years ago and was very impressed by their chilli crab. I mentioned this to my partner and we decided to go back for my birthday seeing we were in Singapore again. It's now a fair bit more commercialized with PA systems to yell out when your table is ready, 2 way radio's between the waiters and a feeling of them trying to get you in and get you out as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the chilli crab wasn't like I remembered it. It was very sweet. They made a nice effort with my birthday and the price of the entire dinner was reasonable but I'm not sure I'll be back

The must visit place for seafood in Singapore. But I found it strictly average and a little over priced. There are far better places to eat at in Singapore, specially the hawker centers where you will get great tasting seafood at much more affordable price point

Jumbo Seafood Riverside is located right next to Clarke quay, which makes it very accessible from MRT, Singapore's main means of transportation. Singapore is renowned for its unique Chili crab dishes, but personally I did not feel it was that delicious. People who aren't fond of cilantro should watch out for it, since it is included in the dish. Also prepare wet wipes and disposable vynil gloves since the restaurant will charge you for the wet wipes on the table. Other than that, the place is wonderful for enjoying the cool breeze blowing from Clarke Quay. It is also right next to the River cruise docking place, so it might be best to make reservations on the day you are planning to ride the rive cruise. Hope those reading this review enjoy their trip

one guy of your waiters was so busy that he was boring to explain the menu to me，wouldn't like tell me the price of crab ，razor clam and so on。so i had to order two set meal $158. he wouldn't like tell me the size of dishes of set meal also。i felt so disappoint 。if in my homeland ，i would stand up and leave immediately 。but im in a strange country 。it was the worst experience and only one dad experience in my journey of Singapore and Thailand

Its Singapore Chilli Crab with Mantou bread is hard to beat. One of the best. Its riverside view also adds a big plus. You can try to visit the restaurant by one of the river boats to enhance your experience.
5
Sri Lanka Crab super nice! Must try it especially pepper flavor, but not cheap...
5
Have dined at this restaurant at least 3 times during different visits to Singapore. Although it is always packed, the food is consistently delicious. With their new reservation and reception, it makes things so much easier for us. Will certainly visit it again and again.
4
Great location for a nice meal of chilicrab and the even better peppercrab. Fried buns, baby kaylang, fried rice and loads of tiger beer make the meal complete. A must when in Singapore.
4
Loved the crab at this seafood restaurant. We ordered the black pepper crab. But it was messy to eat! You will need to get some extra napkins - more than the ones provided. The other food was also quite good. Crowded place with a lot of locals.
4
We had chili crab and 3 vegetable dishes for about SGD 170. The service was very good. We liked the chili crab and two of the vegetables but the third had too much corn starch. We only went here based on the recommendation of a friend. In the future I'd just go to a food court and spend nearly a tenth the cost
3
I had lunch here before embarking on a river cruise.When you are seated you are provided with some Chinese tea and a bowl of peanuts. As I had not asked for them I assumed they were complimentary. I was wrong, when I got the bill an additional $3.20 appeared on the bill, not a lot but irritating.Although a seafood restaurant, I opted for half a roast chicken and a bowl of steamed rice (I had already had chilli crab at another restaurant).That, 2 beers and the add ons noted above came to $44 including tax and service fees
2
service is bad. Only through 3/4 the dinner then only plates were changed, and it was when we requested. Previously, it would be done either halfway through or whenever the service crew noticed the plates were full. Standard of food remains stagnant. We could use the money to get similar quality of food outside and still have money remaining. For the price they are charging and for the service charge, not worth now. Moreover, they give u 2 hours of dining time cos of the next seating which kinda limit the dining experience as well. Will likely not return anymore. Restaurant was crowded and crammed during the week before CNY

Sharks are being slaughtered by their millions for a tasteless delicacy and this restaurant still openly serves shark fin soup. We walked out after a brief glance at the menu.Times are changing and there are plenty of alternatives. Save the sharks before they are all gone.Do not eat here or anywhere else serving shark fin soup
4
Recommended by our concierge but definitely book a table. We had Chilli Crab, Prawns and fried rice. The crab is placed in the centre of the table along with the tools to extract the meat. We were supplied with finger bowls and copious amount of wet wipes and paper towels - definitely needed. It was delicious. The staff are constantly filling a cup with tea. What an experience
3
Dishes were not bad, delicious. But the servers were not really kind.
Atmosphere was good and pleasant.
5
The food selection is large, it is a great location next to the river and the chili/black pepper crab dishes are amazing!
4
We went to Jumbo's as they are known for their excellent Chilli Mud Crab. While we were there we also tried their Black Pepper Mud Crab - which I actually preferred. Would definitely recommend this Jumbo's for your quintessential mud carb experience (complete with bibs!)
4
We tried a couple of things; Fried Fried with Nonya Sauce was good, Crispy-fried Baby Squid was average, Prawns in pumpkin sauce was just amazing. It is a little pricey even for Singapore but was very busy.
4
As someone visiting Singapore once again after previously living there for 14 years I ate at the Jumbo located at Riverside and found it to be excellent and slightly better in terms of the food than the East Coast venue. However be prepared to wait to be seated as this restaurant is extremely popular. My advice book in advance and arrive on time as your spot will be taken if you turn up late. My personal favorite is the Pepper Crab but the Chili Crab is equally tasty. My tip is order the Golden Bread to dip into the Chili Crab sauce a great way to double up on the dining experience. Best shared with a group of friends accompanied by jugs of Tiger beer
3
After the second try, we got the table that we shared with bunch of strangers. We ordered famous Chilli crab because our friend who had recommended. The service was slow and not efficient. Food was average. I have had good crabs before so nothing to sing about it
4
We went there for lunch on our first day in Singapore and hadn't booked. We were asked to share a table and didn't mind that too much. However, I would advise booking. The fresh prawns, scallops were great. We were a bit disappointed with the chilli crab. The sauce was delicious but we weren't convinced whether the crab was actually fresh. All in all, we did enjoy the whole meal
4
Do try their signature chili and pepper crabs, average size ones about $44 per plate. Their sweet and crispy baby sotong (squid) is a must for those with sweet tooth, drunken prawns whereby liquor is poured and shaken live in front of you seems a tad cruel but taste fresh and sweet. "You Tiao" with oyster sauce is tasty too. Go the one located at East Coast Park as it is breezy and you can take a slow stroll after a heavy mea
4
We had a great crab here, it's what they do best. Service leaves a lot to be desired, but hey it's an Asian restaurant that attracts a strong following because of the crabs. The pepper prawns were good as well. Worth going for the crab alone.
5
We arrived there half an hour earlier than our booking time. Staff found an table in ten minutes and seated us there. Excellent riverfront views though a bit crowded in between the tables.Ordered a set menu and gave us 6 dishes. Chill crab was spicy although not too hot so it was unbearable . Large portions and lots of meat, especially the pincers. Crab tasted very fresh and wasn't too much for the two of us. Didn't experience any urge by staff to get us out. Tea wasn't refilled as soon as it was gone but had to be asked for. Staff generally attentive.
4
balanced spicy and spicy sauce & lump crab meat with tremendous scenay of Qlarkuey!
I want more~!!!!
3
Their crab cuisine are really delicious but they do not offer takeout drinks cups. If you would like to order drinks, you must bring your own mug. We spent SGD166.66 for two people! How stingy it is!
4
Calling all crab lovers...it's yummy and not too spicy (for those of you who can't stand spicy food)
5
First time here after last year failed to come cause full already, finally can try great taste of famous chilli crabs...really awesome and very nice.You need to book 1 week before and dont ever late to come, otherwise your table will be cancelled automatically by Jumbo, after 15mins late.Try crabs menu, I choose chilli crabs, with price S$75, and tofu its also OK. The price is bit expensive, but its ok for one time come.Enjoy the crabs..
3
Was highly recommended to try Singapore Crab here. Meh! It was ok. Was not worth the wait and the services was very poor. We waited far too long for our food to come. I've had better. Spicy crab in Belitung Island was way much better and for a third of the price and much better service
4
I sat by the river, when it rains, service staff did not immediately help us to change position and we need to move tables and chairs by ourselves !The meal time is too short !Food is good, but need to extend meal time and enhance services !
5
i really looked forward to visiting jumbo restaurant but i really disappointed and dont wanna visit again especially riverside point branch. the worst thing was service. how unkind!!! how rude!!! in particular the woman staff who served outside, misunderstood the price she told me, then she said "don't you know english?" i think you must enhance the service even from the very basic level!!!!!! worst (service) restaurant and worst experience i've had in singapore!!
1
I booked a table of 4 adults and 1 child. This was our first time in Singapore. We looked at the set menu and we chose set B which was $308 for 4 people, we also ordered some drinks, the bill was $410 altogether. They served us tea which they charged $1.20 per person. On the bill they also charged us $1.20 for peanut which we were not served, I had to tell them to adjust the bill. The place was famous for Chilli Crabs which we ordered included in this set menu and there were just one small crab to share between 4 people. The service was the worst, when asking about their menu, the waiter did not want to answer my questions and was acting like I was bothering him. Overall the dinner was not with $410 and I will never come back here again.
5
We shared a delicious late dinner at this very good restaurant located in Riverside Clark Quay. Unfortunately the Chilli Crab was sold out by the time we arrived, so we tried other seafood and were not disappointed. The scallops and broccoli and baby squid were delicious accompanied with seafood fried rice. Very good quality food and attentive, prompt service. Nice surroundings and a good view of the river from the restaurant. Highly recommended. We would like to return in future earlier in the night and try the chilli crab
5
We visited tonight with our daughter at 7pm, had no reservation took about 5mins to get A shared table inside. We read about this place on trip advisor, and thought to try it. Very yum, we had the chilli crab, fried rice with seafood for our daughter, some Chinese greens with garlic and the buns to dip into the chilli crab sauce. The meal was really yum, lots of flavour. They serve the water(cold) very lukewarm and the peanuts they put down on the table are about a couple of dollars. Very nice meal, but messy you can ask for extra wipes to wipe hands. You will enjoy it, it's a must
4
So yummy chilli crab, should not miss. Nice atmosphere , beside the Singapore river.
Reservation online is convenient .
5
The chilli crab was amazing as were the egg battered prawns. Good, simple service and a really fun meal. 100% worth a visit.
5
Went here after reading in the lonely planet guide and the internet that Jumbo Seafood had the best chilli crab. It was the best Christmas day lunch ever. Friendly staff and fantastic chilli crab. Would go back.
5
I really liked the place..we were there in April 14 for a dinner.. the view on river is very nice, the food is realy good and price is reasonable.. to be raccomanded
5
Of course, Singapore (and Jumbo Seafood Restaurant) is well-known for its chili crab. No doubt about it; we have tried it more than once. But there is another variation of the crab that is just as good > black pepper crab. If you are not a fan of a saucy dish (like chili crab), then this may be the one for you. Aside from Jumbo Seafood Restaurant, you can also have this at Singapore Seafood Republic (a sister company of Jumbo) located in a nook in Sentosa Island
4
We had tried night before but restaurant was full and big queue , decided to try again this evening even though told full when phoned. Took a chance and just turned up at 5.15 ( we hadn't had lunch so were hungry at this time) very busy but charming receptionist gave us a number and told us to come back just before 5.30 . within a couple of minutes we were at a table next to river on the proviso we would have to vacate by 6.45 which was fine by us. We had a set meal for Â£138 for two which included Singapore Slings , a duck starter, fried rice , chilli crab, kang kong sambal and a simple dessert. All most delicious , excellent friendly service and just finished in time, we have booked again to go on the one night we have back in Singapore at the end of our holiday
3
Had 10:15pm advance booking. Got table at 10:45pm near the dirty plates return station.Wok fried cod fish in special chilly sauce was best dish of the day.They forgot to serve one of our dishes till the end - Vietnamese sugarcane roll prawns.Garupa size was too small for the 85-90$ bill they charged only for it.Average experience.Note we found it overt expensive even after having a groupon deal voucher
4
we have been to Jumbo many time. however this time we was surprised by chilli crab. we ask for large king crab. it is very large and delicious. the staff showed us the crab. we said it was ok but we forgot to ask for the price and he did not inform us. when we asked for a bill. chilli crab was about 537 dollas singapore. So , next time you should ask the price before order or confirm it. apart from chilli crab , let try yam scallop. i like it. moreover, it is better to make a reservation. Jumbo is popular restaurant
4
Tried it first in 2011 and really enjoyed it.For our 2nd time there the place was rather crowded and we had to wait 45 minutes ( no reservations ).The staff is friendly and I haven't feel rushed even though they let you know that you have to finish in 1h30min.Ordered a 1.3kg red chilli crab (Alaskan) , a medium fried baby squids portion , a medium Vietnamese sugar cane prawns portion , a large sea food fried rice portion , a large mixed fruits plate + drinks for $205SGD.The food was tasty and the seating outside lovely , but I believe you can get cheaper in other places
3
visited nov 2013. we had the chilli crab. The food here is only hyped. Everything i had here was average. we sat outside. great atmosphere.the place was crowded and we felt the hospitality from the staff was lacking a bit. read more reviews before you make up your mind to visit the plac
4
The staff was kind and resturant's view also pretty cool. if i have another chance to go to resturant, i will visit here. thank you
5
We were lucky to get a table outside facing the river and we really had great time, great food and good service! I definitely recommend this place...but better to book in advance :)
4
Saya akui kepitingnya merupakan salah satu yang terbaik dari sekian banyak resto di Singapore. Good service, good place and great foods. That's all.
Thanks for calendar gift by the way :)
5
Got the set menu for 2 people and were not disappointed! 2 Singapore slings a lobster, caviar and dragon fruit salad was refreshing and delicious. Crumbed prawns, a huge bowl of fried rice with seafood. The crab itself was messy and fun, with handy bibs given out. Followed by dessert of mango sago. The staff were friendly and helpful, and it's right next to the water.
4
After a slightly disappointing meal at No Signboard the night before, I was somewhat apprehensive to try another popular-with-the-tourist restaurant, but Jumbo did not disappoint. The portions were very satisfying with the seafood tasting very fresh. Most people would recommend the chili crab but I ordered the ginger steamed because I didn't want to bury the natural taste of the crab. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the delicate taste of fresh crab. The "kopi ribs" (coffee flavored ribs) were excellent as well. The coffee sauce had a chocolaty aftertaste that which didn't take away from the coffee flavor. It gets crowded early so book ahead

I was in Singapore on a two day stopover in early December and was told that the one food I must try was the Chilli Crab - Singapore's 'unofficial national dish'. So, after a long day of shopping and exploring I found myself on the charming Riverside and saw that Jumbo was extremely busy. So I waited until 9:30pm when things had died down and shared a table on the deck. I ordered the chilli crab to be served with fried buns, and a Singapore Sling.The service was nothing to write home about - they seemed in a rush to get me to order... Which I was happy to oblige, seeing as how there was only one thing I was hungry for.The crab didn't disappoint, huge (for one person, at least), tasty, a lovely tomato and chilli sauce, not too spicy - I was flying long-haul the next day - and lots of fun and mess to remove from the shell. The meal was not disappointing in the least, the crab, the sauce and the fried sweet buns were scrummy.The drink I ordered was not good - I've had Singapore Slings in the past and this was watery and meh; the service changed as soon as my crab arrived and there was a subtle, but increasing feeling that the staff were hovering and waiting for me to depart, my bill was served while I had three of my four buns remaining and I was still in the middle of removing the crab from its shell (too soon!?); I was annoyed that there was only one hand towel provided which I was forced to use to wash my hands to retrieve the money for my meal (unsanitary and rude); and finally, the tea that was poured for me and the peanuts that were put on the table were on the bill - although there was no mention of this by the staff or in the menu. The meal was delicious - although although next time I will try somewhere else, where hopefully the service will be better.
5
When we lived in Singapore we had pepper crab and jugs of Tiger beer every Sunday night at JUMBO's. It has been many years since we have been back but we dream about Jumbos and the excellent food. On our recent visit to Singapore we rushed from the airport straight to dinner at Jumbos and gorged on pepper and chilli crab washed down with jugs of Tiger beer. Also drunken prawns and noodles and steamed fish - it doesn't really matter what you order its ALL GREAT and at sensible almost "hawker stall" prices. The fine dinning restaurants in Singapore are certainly world class BUT for a real taste of Asia EAT AT JUMBOS
4
A trip to Singapore cannot be complete without trying the Singapore Chilli Crab! We asked a local friend to recommend a place to have Singapore chilli crab, and we ended up at Jumbos. Since this was one of the places also recommended by 2 other colleagues, we thought there might be something to it!Service as mentioned with other reviews is not fantastic, but food does seem to come out quickly... Most importantly, the food is very good. We had the Singapore Chilli crab and the Pepper crab. Both were great, however we were told that the chilli crab was much spicier at other venues, the level of spicyness I think was on the money. Get the sweet bread for dipping into the chilli crab sauce!. Planning ahead and booking beforehand is highly recommended
4
I went to Jumbo with my mother, thinking that it was going to be a massive tourist trap, she was keen to try the crab. I was very pleasantly surprised. The service is not fantastic however it it is prompt. The chilli crab was delicious as was the duck and mango salad really enjoyed - we will be bac
3
this place had been sooo recommended to us by the hotel staff + brochures. It's a sausage factory- eventho we had booked we were told on arrival "you have 1hr15 mins to leave"- WOW whatever happened to Hello Welcome ?we just had 2x crabs- chilli and pepper between 4 of us, and wolved it down with some Tiger beer- just made the curfew !! Food great, service non-existant, ambience- forget it 
3
Plus side - 1) nice view sitting by the river. 2) They squeezed us in even though we didn't have a reservation. Although we had to be out of there by 7:30 pm to clear the table for the next reservation. Negatives - 1) Service was really horrible. Curt waiter took our order, and then never came back until the bill, and the reminder that our time was up. 2) Chili crab was okay, but was definitely not worth $80 Singaporean dollars. Also $7.50 for a glass of beer seemed steep. 3) The table next to us was so close it felt like we were on a double date
3
Visited Jumbo with some family friends on our last trip to Singapore. The seafood itself is very fresh. Due to the cantonese style cooking, there are a lot of "extras" on the dish. We found this a bit difficult to eat on a few dishes that were covered in hot peppers. The service was bizarre. First, the waitress sat our party of 6 at a sharing table meant for 10. We could either sit with an empty chair between everyone, or sit in a semi circle around the table. Next, you have to order your food from one server and beer from another server. They don't cross paths at all, so getting a refill is difficult as they can only refill half of your drinks. Finally, the food is served by yet another person who comes from the kitchen. Any questions you have about the food have to go through this person. We had a few vegetarians in the group and it took a while to determine if our requests had actually made it through the kitchen (one did, one vegetarian dish was not served vegetarian). The East Coast seafood market definitely has the freshest seafood, and at these prices I will be trying a different restaurant the next time I visit
3
We had just arrived in Singapore, and were walking around the sweltering heat from our hotel, and were after some lunch. We knew our first meal had to be chilli crab.We had a read a bit about this place, and it looked okay.... The chilli crab did not disappoint. It was savoury and sweet and delicious.Probably a bit overpriced, and is aimed at tourists, but it did the trick
4
I specifically visited this restaurant for chilli crab and came out satisfied. Just found out after finishing my meal that on request they even crack open the crab. l found deep fried buns too greasy. Good service considering the busy place. If looking for casual dinning this is the place
4
this is an institution in Singapore, always busy - mostly Tourists but also locals and families. The atmosphere is frantic, loud and cramped. The service is efficient and fast. The Chili Crab is wonderful, make sure you get the breadrolls to mop up the sauce. The other seafood menu items are good - not great. We've eaten at other "famous" crab restaurants in Singapore but find ourselves returning to Jumbo.
1
Normally go to Jumbo Seafood East Coast Branch when in Sing' but thought we'd try Riverside for a change. The food was excellent; chilli crab, black pepper crab, salted fish fried rice and broccoli. Beer cold and white wine very reasonably priced (especially as the main tourist area in Singapore). Good table location next to the river.The major let down is poor service, nobody smiles, food is almost thrown down with I don't want to be here attitude. Then my wife went to the toilet only to see the female staff leave without washing their hands ....in a restaurant this totally unacceptable.Fortunately she was not our server so we were all fine the next day
5
Finally came to this place for her legendary Chilli Crab. I was very impressed and felt my trip and money worthwhile. I had a 1Kg Chilli Crab(S$68), and it came out perfect. In fact, just nice, not too much and not too little. I did not have the Alaska Live Crab because I did not fly 8000 miles from SFO for Live Alaska Crab. There are tons of it in SFO's Fisherman's wharf. Just regretting for ordering rice(S$0.80) which I didn't even touch. And the peanuts and the tea were a waste too because I didn't touch those too. BTW, they do charge for the tiny cup(S$1.20) of tea which is refillable and the peanuts(S$1.20). Must come back for more in the near future
4
Food - tasty and deliciousService - there's some communication barrier as I don't speak Cantonese but is easily fixed by English speaking waitress Ambiance - right next to a river/canal and it is amazingThis place is worth the visit if you are in Singapore
4
While in Singapore on a two-week business trip, I was told that I had to try chilli crab and pepper crab. Jumbo's ticked both of these boxes. The food was good and the portions big. The service staff left much to be desired.We were seated at a large family style table to three other parties which wasn't a big deal. We did enjoy our time.I would recommend going to Jumbo at least once to give it a shot
2
 On Nov. 16th. Sunday, the female manager who was charged tables around riverside was very unkind. Her behavior and words made us very uncomfortable. First, when we'd like to have an iced water instead of tea, her face was not good. Second, as we asked two plastic gloves and she said that she had nothing like that, but looks-like sub waiter brought gloves and iced water to us.  We heard very clearly that she said bad words for us. It's not a good but a very rude manner for serving customers coming around the world. But subwaiter was verg kind although manager told him never give them facilities any more
4
pepper crab tastes ok, not surprise. atmosphere is good with waterfront. service is good. expect servier have much more smile.
3
Although a popular place, the staff have attitude and we were disappointed with the chill mud crab. Felt like it was all pretty generic.
1
All employees in restaurant are not kind.
Also they were just concentrated to make customers spend more money
Even though Menu i ordered was enough, she said it was too small to eat for my family.
4
We arrived just in time as the place filled up real quick! Sharing of tables is a requirement but the chilli crab is really worth it albeit really pricey! We enjoyed our dinner in Singapore! Two thumbs up!
5
Really enjoyed eating here with colleagues, got a great table by the water. Recommend the award winning chilli crab and the spinach crusted tofu for vegetarians (they cater well for those who dont eat seafood FYI).
4
After all the reports we tried the chilli crab and I must say I wasn't disappointed, the taste and presentation were both excellent, make sure that you ask for a bib as you'll need one. The service wasn't the best I've ever received and other than the crab main the rest of the meal was average but pricey. Great location but could be improved
5
My Sister and her in-laws were in Singapore for a quick 4 day stopover.So, as soon as she landed all 11 of us and a baby, made our way to Jumbo's Seafood at Riverside (Merchant Rd).. not to be confused with the one at Riverwalk :SWe had an table outdoors (with fans blowing) and it was the perfect atmosphere. We ordered chilli crab (the best) with deep fried mantou(recommended to slurp the sauce up with), deep fried squid (goes sooo well with a beer), Spinach and century yr old egg, cereal prawn and soo much more. Everything was delicious! even the fried rice.The service by Kwa Kheng Kiauw was exceptional. She was our waitress.She was so attentive. Gave us covers for our handbags, plastic snap locks for our phones (so the chilli crab doesn't splash on it), children plates for the kiddies and chopsticks for every one that the baby dropped :P We didn't have to ask, she was always there to assist us.Great time spent there.. definitely recommend it
4
When your travelling somewhere around the world, and someone say you must try this place, that's this place. Was told on 3 occasions to try this restaurant. The food was good, the chill crab was very good and the prices were over the top. 7/10, but be prepared to pay. 3 chill crab $254 Singapore dollars
4
The best chilli crab served in town. Excellent service but to avoid weekend due to crowd and limit on dining time. Great variation of food, another must try is the lamb chop, simply mouth watering even just by thinking and reviewing it.Just few of the reasons i held my wedding banquet here, the FOOD is delicious
4
Make sure you have a reservation.The food is excellent, but the service is below standard. Our server did barely speak English and clearly did only strict minimum, after we asked. It probably helps if you go there with a local.But again the food is really worth it
4
I had dinner there during my business trip end of October. I cannot complain. Food was nice and service was good. I paid 60 SGD and could not finish everything.
5
Its a pilgrim whenever I visit Singapore - altering between Chilli or Pepper Crab. Not cheap but satisfying and proximity to transport and atmosphere. A cold beer by the Riverside after.
4
Each dish is really delicious in its own way. Atmosphere in the restaurant is also a plus but there is much to work on the service part.
4
I recently took our team for Asia out to dinner at the Jumbo Seafood Riverside. The service was excellent for our entire group and we were very well accommodated considering how busy they were. The prices were reasonable and the entire team had a great tim
5
We tried both Jumbo seafood restaurant in Singapur and next 4 other seafood restaurant. Both Jumbo are No. 1&2. Cheaper and more delicious than other on the riverside. Really kind personal. We tried about ten meals and all are very good. I recommend both crabs, jellyfish and crisp octopus. Try it. You shouldn't be unsatisfied.
4
It was our last day in Singapore and we'd heard from several sources - cab drivers, hotel staff - that Jumbo's Riverside had the best chili crab in town. So we chose it for our last big lunch before leaving and were delighted. I've read reviews about it being expensive, and it was. But there's a choice of two banquet meals that offer reasonable value for a seafood feast with the famed chili crab. Actually, we substituted the Black Pepper Crab and were amazed at both the delicious flavour and the amount of meat we were served. And the service was both efficient and polite, so we were a bit surprised to read how other TA diners have been disappointed. The place was packed and mostly with locals, not tourists, but we only had to wait about ten minutes for a table, and enjoyed a chilled Tiger while waiting. It is possible to book a table, and even to request a table on the river frontage if you're really lucky, so get the hotel to book ahead. In summary, expensive but worth it for great food and good service
4
I went there with my friend just to try their chilli crab and have to wait for the table. There was a long queue. But less than 30 minutes we got sharing table with others. For us it doesn't matter. The service was good and fast. The food was superb. I tried also the salted egg prawn. Yum eeee. Yhe place is noisy but I didn't expect a quiet romantic dinner either. So overall jumbo riverside is a place worth to go for. I would go back again but will make reservation this time :
3
We had our concierge recommend Jumbo to us as we wanted to try singapore chilli crab and black pepper crab. We arrived at 840pm and were told the wait would be 1.5hrs and that we should walk to the other Jumbo down the river. We said we would wait after also being brushed off when enquiring about booking for the next night she said to call a number. So the 1.5hrs wait was really 25mins, which flew by. Once getting to the table we were offered green tea promptly but then had to ask 4 times to place an order. Once the order was placed the food came out quickly.The food was nice
4
This is my many times of visit to Jumbo Seafood Gallery (Riverside) as it is the best outlet among all the Jumbo outlets. In fact, even when I compare against other seafood restaurants, JSG (Riverside) fair way above the rest. Their crabs are always very fresh and if you order a female crab and if it has roes, there are so much crab roes for a 1.1KG crab, that it can be shared among 4 person
2
We visited the jumbo sea food on 25th October, and as we were walk ins, we had to wait for over 60 mins for a table, and post that also, we could get a sharing table. The food was over hyped and nothing great to deserve such a long wait. The service was extremely poor and a big no for veg persons
1
Food was very expensive compare to taste, quality and quentity. Service was awful. I won't visit this place never again.
3
[Good One]
- Nice and kind staffs
- Robster and Prawn's taste was awesome
[Feel inconvenience]
- Too Crowded to talk
- Doesn't feel perfectly clean
- So expensive (compared with overall satisfaction)
4
The black pepper crab, deep fried Bread are delicious, but very expensive. Nearby the MRT Clark Quay, easy to find.
4
It's so crowded. Too many people... But it's worth the wait as I really love their black pepper crab. Supper nice! Better to reserve before you go.
3
Many people enjoy food. The food was delicious in the restaurant.. but actually staff did not kind. They were cool for me. So I just enjoy food. that's all.
2
I have visited Jumbo Seafood many times at different outlets. The overall impression remains the same - I am unable to enjoy my meal because of its rushed service. Riverside outlets appears to be perpetually crowded even on weekdays. Service staff are over stretched to serve diners. I have to request 5 times before my tea is served. When placing my order for food, it's interesting to have the staff stop me from ordering more because "you already ordered so much, maybe you cannot finish". Well, perhaps the real reason was that I might take longer time to finish my meal and hold them up! The whole place appears to be a coffee shop more than a restaurant. It was noisy, cramped and practically no service to speak about.

the best chilli crab and black pepper crab.. we can eat the chilli crab with the small crispy bun.. so yummy! I liked the Jumbo Seafood at riverpoint, better get at the outdoor, ao the view is the bridge on riverside.. Prawn and the calamary also delicious .. when u visit go to Singapore, don't forget to go to Jumbo.

Recently had dinner with a friend at the Jumbo (not the overcrowded branch on top of Clarck Quay) on Merchant Road. The most frequent price in the menu was "Seasonal Price", meaning "ask the waitress". We did. It required 3 different waitresses to get a price for the dishes we wanted to order. The prices were about 30% higher than other seafood restaurants. We ode red a "lobster" which, to the words of the waitress wieghs 900gr. She added that it was a large enough dish for two (men). After about 30 minutes of anticipation we received a large king prawn or a medium size langoustine, accompanied by a bill quoting the price of 400gr. When asked the waitress denied mentioning the weight of the creature. In addition to the above mentioned "lobster" we had a soup and fried rice. The bill totalled in about 100 SGD (80 USD), for the "lobster" they charged 60 SGD.The other dishes were average. Nothing to write home about. The atmosphere resembled a train station on a busy Monday morning.Never will I set foot in this tourist trap again. Singapore has scores of restaurants serving better food and charging more reasonable prices
2
Its a very turistic place due to location. Speciality Crab, we tried several other plates butreally nothing to feel that you ate wonderful seafood. always full outside difficult to get a table and inside is very noisy. Service is bad and you must eat in a certain time since they need the table.If you calll from your hotel its very difficult to get a table its easier if you just go walk in
5
I managed to book a table for 3 a day in advance. I couldn't leave Singapore without trying their famous Chilli Crab! After reading through the reviews, I had my mind set on having great food with bad service. However, I was surprised to get the best of both. The only issue we had was the location of our table. We were right at the end where people walking past kept staring at our food. We tried to move but gave up and decided to just eat and leave. The food was absolutely delicious! We were so full afterwards. The waiter that was looking after us was so kind and helpful. He even managed to get our picky 4 year old to eat! Highly recommended
5
Very patient staff and good services, foods are delicious also :)
However it is quite crowded, better make reservations in advanced.
3
Our order was lost and finally they re ordered same. Crabs were only 800 gr way too small. This is the 3rd time in a row they have served all crabs
4
The e-form is easy to fill up and very efficient too. Once I reach the front desk, they could track my booking easily, and table has been arrange in less than 5 mins.
4
It has good atmosphere and service. Chilli Crap is good taste but little salty.
I hope the chilly crab lower its salt.
5
Very busy .. Be prepared to wait or make a booking .. We only tried the signature dish and it was easily the best crab we have ever eaten !
3
The singapore chili mud crab was very good but other dishes that my friends tried were not on par. 3 of the meals came out at the same time but we waited on the last one for a further 15 minutes. We had to call over a waitress to order anything. If you go I would recomend sticking to the chili crab and expect the service to be terrible. 
5
Been dropping in the Jumbo restaurants for years, first stop at the Riverside. Arrived at busy time and had to wait about 45 minutes. Got a great riverside table (best in the house). Again the same great drunken prawn, chilli crab, asparagus, seafood fried rice as at the east coast branch; the same great quality delivered with great service! Needed the bib, messy work!! Overview of the river was terrific All was terrific!! A great dinner & this place is not to be missed
4
Food was spectacular as always, service was quick and efficient. Only gripes were the space between the tables. Once you get 2 or 3 big tables back to back, don't even think about getting up till you're done and ready to leave the restaurant. Also, the turnaround time to prep the tables. We were on time for our reservation but had to wait for at least 10 - 15 mins more for our table
5
So... I'm allergic to seafood. Something of a problem eating out in Singapore? Nah... Just means picking carefully.I had the best ribs I've ever eaten here... Bit of honey, bit of smoke... Perfect! Followed by a superb venison in black bean sauce... Hurrah!Oh, and my colleague highly recommends the chilli crab
5
Your visit to Singapore is not complete unless you eat at Jumbo Seafood and order the chili crab. The crab is the largest I have ever seen. Don't shy away from the bib, you will need it. It is messy but the best tasting crab ever! Enjoy a Tiger beer with friends. The calamari was great as was the duck meat salad.
4
The food was excellent especially the chili crab and cereal coated prawns. The place was crowded as usual but service was prompt and courteous. Outside table was nice. Enjoyed the experience. Somewhat pricey
3
I was expected, but less than expected.
Servers were not nice and so lazy :(
Also they didn't understand what did i say.
3
Our experience at the jumbo seafood restaurant was average. Chilli crab was ok but we had the feeling of being rushed to finish our food so that the next guests could be seated. It was not a relaxed dinner.
4
All the Jumbo outlets I've been to have been consistent, which is fantastic. Service here is always friendly and not rushed, and the food pacing is great. Order the Chilli Crab and coffee ribs!
5
You need to go there twice, and taste chilli crab the first time, pepper sauce crab the second one. You will find difficult to decide which is better. Very nice environment, Price affordable. (even if words above sound as advertising, this is what we did)
3
Was recommended this restaurant by a local tour guide as one of the better places to get chili crab. Sadly it did not live up to the recommendation. We ordered the two styles of crab: Pepper crab and chili crab, so we could compare these icons Singapore cuisine. We are rushed to our table located in the worst corner of the restaurant when the waiter approached us he told us that if we wanted chili crab we needed order it now because it was going to take at least an hour. So we went ahead and ordered our entire meal and everything came out in pieces, the side dishes came out first after about 15 minutes, than the pepper crab and then finally the chili crab. Which pretty much killed any thought of being able to compare the two styles of crap. Overall the waitstaff was rude and ignored us for good 30 minutes after we are finished with our meal
1
Dont go there - There are plenty of other seafood restaurant in Singapore - We booked a table and then waited 50 mn without anybody coming to take the order. After 50 mn and numerous tentative to talk to somebody after numerous of "wait" a lady came with a chili crabs we had not ordered. Reply was you eat first we discuss after. We decided to leave the restaurant and to eat elsewhere. Terrible experience I would not recommend it
5
We didn't book the table before we went to Singapore for holiday, so we waited about half hour to get a table. But it's all worth for waiting. The chilli crab is so yummy so we went back the restaurant the next day to have it again
5
We went to the Jumbo Seafood Restaurant at Clarke Quay. It was packed with people eating Singapore Chilli Crab. It was completely booked out for the next 5 nights so we had Lunch instead. Do not miss it on your next trip to Singapore. Absolutely Delicious and not at all expensive, except for the wine
5
Chili-Crab at it best. In order to enjoy this Singapore special, make sure you book at least 48 hours in advance, [yes it popular] . This dish makes your trip to Singapore complete with great service and marvelous setting near the River at Clarke Quay , then stroll along the the promenade and enjoy a cold beer at the many pubs situated there. ont miss it
5
I visited this place with my parents from Korea.
Foods were very delicious and nice.
We are very saticefied with JUMBO!
3
Found long hairs in the Chili Crab which was not plesant....would think this can be improved....also resataurnt inside was really crewded ......
2
service was very unpleasure....
I ordered fried rice, and after 40 mininute,,, rice was not arrived...
I asked 3 times, but, there was no reply....
After all I gave up eating fried rice....
3
The meals were very delicious but it turned out to be a very expensive dinner. Will be sticking to the hawker centres. Meals are just as delicious but 10 times cheaper
3
Went there yesterday with my family. Try the chilli crab and it's good. However, the service is very lousy. The waitress picking up our order is rude. Jumbo better trains up their people well; otherwise, clients are not gonna come back again.
4
love their crabs and views from the restaurant... regular who keep coming back!!
bamboo clams, chilli crabs were our hot favourites!!
4
Wasn't that keen to go to this restaurant as I'm not a seafood lover however this changed during the evening. First time eating crab and loved it. The chilli crab was especially good but the pepper version also nice. Our group had a set menu of 8 courses and very enjoyable. Busy restaurant and the drink service was a bit slow as a result but well worth the visit
3
The food undoubtedly stands up for the reputation it has.It looked good and tasted even better. But the service was very poor. Though we had a reservation and got there on time, there was no table ready. We stood and waited as they cleaned a table which had drenched in the rain and put it up outside in the corner most space available! We had to wait and try and spot the staff for every order. That was quite disappointing. 
3
It is definitely a place for tourist. It is so fully booked that we only managed to book dinner at 10pm. There is a Jumbo Gallery restaurant nearby But somehow that one has plenty of available slots for booking. Not sure what the difference is. The black pepper crab is more tasty than the chili crab. Somehow the waitress tried to stop us from ordering the set meal. The whole crab weight 1.5 kg & cost S$100 which is very expensive. Our waitress also objected to everything we tried to order which was a bit annoying. Beware of the cost of the beer by jug. I would only visit once in my trip because of the price
3
There are better places for crab but this is not a bad option if you're hosting an out of town visitor and want to be within stumbling distance of the Clark Quay nightlife.Service is not great, their chili crab is better than their black pepper. Order the buns to dip into the sauce.Overall ok
2
I'm not even gonna try to put every mistake on tripadvisor, Food is oké, at least the dishes were we finally got, but nothing special.
Don't go here.
2
Been there a few times, mostly to bring overseas friends to try their famous chilli crab. Not too bad, but is feel it's overpriced. Other recommended dishes include the salted egg prawn, asparagus scallop and desert mango sago is worth trying.
3
The chilli crab just a little bit above the ordinary, but the Salty Fish fried rice is good. The salty egg prawn is ordinary.
4
Its a must try when in Singapore, and their Chilli Crab is to die for but unfortunalty it is way too expensive, around $60 for one crab is a rip off ! But it does taste amazing.
3
We went at lunch, didn't have a reservation so had to sit inside sharing a table with others which was fine but the tables outside remained empty during our visit. As others have noted they will try to charge you for nuts, warm towel and tea which you may not want. It was a shame that the crab was not priced so you didn't know the price of the crab until paying. Be prepared to get messy - they give you the bib for a reason!! Crab was tasty we also had the mini steamed buns (10) and the fried cod dish which were both good. The waiter tried to pressurise us into ordering more but this was plenty for 2 people. Tasty but don't expect anything special.
3
The food was absolutely delicious, the meal also included unlimited tea which was excellent.However the staff were rude, surly and pushy. There was some kind of screaming fight in the kitchen while we were there. Unprofessional and a real shame considering how great the food was
2
My husband and I actually really enjoyed the chili crab at Jumbo. We would have REALLY enjoyed our experience were it not for a few things that really turned me off:1. Everyone except for one lady at the restaurant seemed like a total jerk. The service was terrible - We asked for water and they only brought one cup, and we had to pester them each time we wanted a refill.2. The peanuts on your table when you arrive are NOT FREE! They'll charge you $1.20 on your bill without telling you.3. The hot tea is also NOT FREE! This was the first Chinese restaurant I've been to where hot tea wasn't complimentary.4. It's not very clean - the bathroom is just terribly dirty, which always makes me wonder about the kitchen.To be honest, I probably would've left a much warmer review if I didn't feel like I got scammed for the price of peanuts and hot tea. But that, together with how poorly we felt we were treated, leaves me with quite a sour taste in my mouth. When you spend about S$100 on your meal, you don't expect to get nickeled and dimed for peanuts and tea!Lower your expectations if you go here, and you should be just fine..
3
This for the riverside restaurant.As I felt like going chinese, I went to this place... Before reading on TA.I have tried chinese before so I knew you order dish combos.I ordered one quarter chicken with fried rice and veggie. Way too much! This would have been fine for two persons, not one.Ok, it was ok and I knew that beforehand.Service was quick and I left 40min later.The price was too steep for my liking and they even try and charge money for the snack and napkin, if you choose to use it.So I cannot recommend this place unless you go as a page minimum
4
Never try their food before,went there because my friend from Taiwan wish to try their famous Chili crab and Black pepper crab. Never call for reservation because we only 2 person. Reach there around 7pm,share table with other. Order their Chili crab and black pepper crab. 800g around $54. Not a season for Sri Lankan crab,so hv no chance to taste.
1
Went there for lunch today. Got there at 1.45 and we're told had to order by 2.15 and we had to leave the restaurant by 3.00 pm. We ordered the chilli crab and the buns. Our waiter just placed a bowl of nuts on our table and filled 2 glasses with Chinese tea which they later tried to charge us for. Our lunch came and while the meal was good once again the staff were extremely rude and we had to ask for napkins for our hands. The finger bowl was also so small it was a waste of time using it. At 2.30 our waiter gave us the bill. He came back 5 minutes later and told us we had to pay now. After telling him now was not a good time as I hadn't finished eating and my hands were covered in crab sauce he returned with a hand full of napkins and said I had to pay now. I would recommend that people give this restaurant a miss as the experience is just plain bad and you are not made to feel welcome
5
Love the chili crab! love the fried fritters and the muscles all the seafood definitely fresh. The service was very quick! The Chili Kang Kong was totally amazing!
2
Although famous for the craps, and they do a decent job of those, the service is poor and the restaurant overpriced. With so much nice food to be had in Singapore avoid spending you money in this place.
2
Good place to avoid despite the hype. Many folks recommended we try Jumbo's. Wife and I ate there Thursday May 15. Started on the phone with reservations saying "if you are 15 minutes late you lose your table". OK. Showed up for 5:30PM reservation at 5:15PM and was issued a card with table number and asked to sit and wait. Got table at 5:30PM. Servers totally disinterested and from the start could tell this was not going to be great. Got the Chile Crab of course and it came with one cracker and one small fork thing for two people. Asked for more but never came. Crab is very, very, messy and impossible not to get all over you (red sauce that gets everywhere). I cracked a claw and got sprayed all over a new shirt with red sauce. Asked for napkins (none on the table) but got none. Later saw them handing out bibs. Was not offered one. Crab tasted fine but not worth the effort at all. Rest of food was basic Chinese and very bland. All very hurried to get us out by 6:45PM for next reservation. Bottom-line: don't bother with this place. Go somewhere where they care
4
This restaurant is famous for chilli crab and black pepper crab. (They sell their secret sauces in boxes so you can recreate the dish at home.) For 7 of us, we ordered chilli crab, crab fried with ginger and shallots, oatmeal prawns, spinach with 3 types of eggs, mini squid and fried rice. The food was excellent, as always. Service was good too, considering that this place is so packed every night of the week. It is best to make a reservation early or risk waiting for a long time to get a table. The restaurant will send you a text message with your reservation code. They will also call you in the morning to confirm. The only problem is the staff from China cannot pronounce English words coherently. The only thing I don't enjoy about eating there is the time limit placed on all diners. We have to be in and out of there within 1 hr 45 min. Fortunately, the food comes very quickly, so we still enjoyed our dinner and a decent pace.If you want to enjoy your dinner without being chased out, go to the Jumbo branch at East Coast Parkway. The place is huge and you get a nice breeze from the sea
1
I cant believe why they are serving like that.. I did nothing wrong to them but the server seems to be angry and annoying to every customer. They never smile. I thought most of the singaporeans are kind but here??? Not at all!!!! jumbo i am not gonna visit here again and because of this place i even deslike singapore
3
Waited some 50 minutes for parts of our meal and had to remind the staff twice of this - it came eventually and was good. All in all a bustling place (both Clarke Quay restaurants) and good for big-group dining.I'm not the biggest crab fan, though can appreciate it is fresh and tasty - the fish and tofu dishes were authentic and generous portion-sizes.Pity about the bathrooms being so far away - not entirely family-oriented (visited twice in one week, first with family and then with friends). Would come again, not bad value for money

Well everybody knows Jumbo seafood as one of the major "chilli Crab" place. Yes the food follow a proper standard but the service, no offence is worst than any third world country... I explained, we went there few weeks ago to enjoy a sunday lunch by the river... What a mistake...!We did order couple of appetizers and yes their famous "Chilli Crab", and we did paired it with a bottle of wine. Normally the drink always come with the food, if possible, but with them, the bottle arrived after they served the appetizers and the crab... well, why not?! They might be busy as we arrived around 1:20pm and it is in the middle of the service... but the most funny and at he end not so great was that in the middle of our "fight" with the crab, so for those who never had it, imagine yourself eating with your hands, meaning they are full of sauce, and trying to remove the flesh from the crab, well at approximatively 2:15pm, the waiter came with the bill and asked us to settle it on the spot.I nicely inform him that we are in the middle of our lunch and well he will have to come back later... Not sure if my english is good, I had to repeat it twice as he was insisting on that matter... Well, guess what, the manager came to ask if there's a problem, and asked me again to settle the bill.... I am not sure if they understand what's going on... I AM EATING AND MY HANDS ARE FULL OF SAUCE.... ! Again have to explain him the situation: Sorry Sir but you will have to come back, as I'm eating right now.....! And so the manager came with a great excuse, sorry Sir but the system will switch off, so you have to pay now, while giving me a wet tissue...How the System can switch off, when your restaurant is still full of customers which some of them just arrived.....???Is there any common sense in your outlet? I mean if you want people to pay fast do like in coffee shop, give them the bill before they start eating....!!!And by the way don't need to stand beside me, waiting for me to finish... Of course I will pay, like everybody, just use your common sense..... and don't need to give attitude to your guest...!!!So in few words, that is their standard, late drinks but early bill... really...???Should I go back.... hmmm, well there is so many other places selling "GOOD" chilli crab... don't bother with them... And by the wine the 10% you are charging to your guest is called " Service Charge" so start to give service...
4
We had dinner here one time and ordered their famous "Award Winning Chilli Crabs" and the "Signature Black Pepper Crabs". First, the apron we wore was cute. And the food? Oh, the black pepper crabs were just lovely. I love the spicy peppery sauce, very tasty. The Chilli Crabs were also nice. We finished everything and went home very full but satisfied
2
Went for a special 70th birthday... They gave us a great table along the river..... Thanks!! Waiters spoke limited English which made ordering extremely stressful. Especially as they only gave us a 90 minute window to finish eating... Beware of the peanuts that they give you when you arrive as they charge for them !!!!Crab was very fresh which was good. But not much service and profeasionalism to help us eat ..... Very small limited water bowls for hands... The table was too small for our plates. Only one set of seafood utensils so we needed to ask for more.. And we had to beg for bibs to protect clothing from chilli crab sauce.Also if you are sensitive to msg be careful as the food tastes like it has it added... Won't be back
3
After reading everywhere that we had to have the chilli crab here, we did but what a mess since the crab is eaten entirely with your fingers! Wish I had thought to order a side of rice to soak up the sauce, which was tasty but impossible to enjoy as much as I would have liked. The view at this location was great and I guess that is part of what you're paying for since the crab was quite pricey and they even added on for the peanuts that were already on the table. A one-time experience only
5
we had to wait around 40 minutes to be seated,but well worth the wait,the food was superb,served hot and no delay between courses,prices in line with Singapore ,the sea food is as good as any i have tasted,superb experience and one we can thoroughly recommend
5
Have been there on each of my 3 visits to Singapore (the most recent being today) and I am a huge fan. The chilli crab is great, perfectly cooked and with a great sauce. It's about $50sg a kilo which is about half the cost of an Aussie alternative, so a perfect opportunity to pig out on a couple of crabs! Be sure to get a few buns to mop up the sauce. Everything else on the menu we've tried is good too. Service is authentically Asian (functional). You need to book and you can do so online. If you love your chilli crab, you'll like it her

We had dinner at Jumbo Seafood restaurant in February. We ordered three dishes: King prawn stir-fried with glaze soya, Braised homemade spinach skin bean curdSupreme fried rice with seafood. Both 2 and 3 can be shared because of the large size. Dish 2 didnâ€™t look as good as shown on the picture (menu) but tasted good. Dish 3 was bit of too dry. I like King prawn most, highly recommended.Together with tea and nuts, the total price for this dinner was Singapore $68.74, which including 10% service charge and 7% GST.Note: This is popular place to dine at Clark Quay, either make an appointment or go early. Another option is to share table which you can get seats fairly fast, that what we did. Service was efficient
4
This is one of those places that you just have to go to when in Singapore, the seafood is very tasty and delicious. Just be aware that this is not a romantic, lingering dinner. It does feel a bit like a factory, very noisy, staff running around and very fast table turnovers. It is quite expensive, however in my opinion, quite worth it
4
This is the second time in 10 years that I have been to Singapore and Jumbos. The Chilli crab was as good as I remembered it. Sitting outside on a beautiful evening just added to the experience. Total bill for 2 people was $194 Singapore which is expensive compared to some places. Service was very goo
5
A great dinning experience in singapore, sat outside by the river one night and enjoyed everything about this Jumbos seafood Restuarant The chilli grab was fantastic, not to spicy and plenty of sauce, make sure you order the buns to dip in the sauce.Service was very good.We will certainly be returning

Jumbo Seafood was recommended by a good friend, originally from Singapore.I booked via their website and promptly got my confirmation for lunch. No problems there.Happened to wander past the restaurant the day before to confirm. No problem. Asked for inside table and was told they'd do thrir best.So, today arrived. We arrived for our booking and got a pleasant greeting and taken to our table inside. No problem.Told the waiter no tea, no peanuts. No problem. Ordered drinks and given time to look through the menu. When we've decided, we call for the waiter. No delay, no hassle.We choose a nice prawn dish as a starter, to be followed by Gai Lan (small serve suggested), Hong Kong style noodles (small serve suggested) and, of course, Chilli Crab! OK. So one minor problem. We get the Gai Lan first. Chilli Crab arrives but we advised the waiter that we wanted the prawns first. No problem. The waitress says that they serve so many that they can give it to another table.The prawns arrive, fresh, hot and tasty. Starter finished and we let the waitstaff know we're ready for the mains.The crab arrives. The noodles arrive. We've been enjoying some of the veggies. EVERYTHING IS GREAT. The crab is fresh, spicy, MESSY but tasty and wonderful.Of course, while we were waiting for our food, the table next to us has two young ladies having crab. One has her first mouthful. You can tell it's spicy hot, a bit of a surprise to her but she's loving it.The table on the other side is a mother and son. They, too, ordered crab and seem to be enjoying it.Everyone is enjoying their meals, getting their fingers covered in this great sauce. Enjoying the 'battle' with crab & nutcracker to break the shell and just having a wonderfully tasty 'fight' for the yummy sweet meat.No problems getting extra hand wipes or service. They are busy but there's enough staff to get served.Before getting the bill, I recall that you can buy the chilli sauce paste mix and the pepper spice mix. I ask for a box of each and the wauteess happily adds that to the bill, which arrives promptly. Bill paid, my spice boxesvarrive in a carry bag along with the receipts.I mention to one waiter that I'll never get my attemot to be as good as what we just ate and he actually gave me some great suggestions for when I try back home. Very helpful and friendly staff!My only 'complaint' is that they didn't serve any sort of light beers so my partner had to 'suffer' through full strength, hence the 4 out of 5 stars.I really DON'T understand all of the complaints people have made in the past. If you're expecting them to lay prostrate at your feet to serve you, they won't. They're flat out serving a full restaurant of people.If you want service and POLITELY get someone's attention, which wasn't hard for us, they are happy to come and serve you.Great food, reasonable service. Be prepared to need a shower abd possibly a change of shirt if you're not careful. (They do give you bibs but if you get a but enthusiastic getting into the crab, it can be a bit messy

My research of Singapore led me to believe I MUST try the Chilli Crab and that Jumbo was the place to do so.Well we did try the Chilli Crab, and it does taste amazing, but I would like to think there are much better places to do so. In short, as with many other reviews, we found the service completely dismal, especially for the price tag. Despite booking in advance we were told we could not have the Riverside table unless we wanted to wait another 40 or so minutes. As we were hungry we elected to sit inside. We were way down the back of the restaurant, zero atmosphere, unfriendly staff and a real feeling that you were a number to get in and out ASAP.That said the food was very good and I can see why its busy. We ordered Chilli Crab, 8 fried buns (between two) and a side of greens. Our crab cost us $55.00 ++. The Chilli Crab was delicious and I really enjoyed eating it, although its messy and the finger bowls were not really adequate. The buns were tasty but not too flavoursome, perfect for mopping up crab sauce. The side of vegetables was okay but paled compared to the crab. I'd eat Chilli Crab again, but maybe at a different restaurant

We have just returned from nearly 3 months travelling in Australasia & we made our normal 2-day stop in Singapore, one of our favourite cities on the way to Melbourne.This restaurant was definitely the worst restaurant we eat in during the whole holiday. Friends had recommended we try Chilli Crab from the Jumbo Seafood restaurant at 30, MERCHANT ROAD, RIVERSIDE POINT, SINGAPORE, 058282.Knowing it was very popular, we booked 4 weeks in advance to ensure we got a table for 2 without queuing.PLEASE REMEMBER THE NAME & ADDRESS OF THIS RESTAURANT!!!!There are many restaurants selling Chilli Crab in this area.My booking made online was quickly confirmed with a note informing us that there was a time limit of 75mins to eat the meal.Although I think this is far too short to properly enjoy a decent meal, we only intended to order 1 course, the Chilli Crab & therefore the time limitations may be acceptable?We arrived 10mins early hoping we would be given extra time but unfortunately this was NOT the case because we were told that we would still be required to vacate the table in 75mins from the moment we sat down. Again this may have been tenable but we had to wait 15mins before our order was taken.A jug of beer quickly arrived after we had ordered with tea & nuts. I asked for the tea to be removed because we had beer but was still charged along with the nuts at the end of the meal. The Chilli Crab arrived with a side dish of Seafood Fried Rice to absorb the sauce with the Crab. After we were halfway through eating our Crab dish (probably 45mins after sitting down) I kept being asked if I wanted to order anything else after we finished the Crab & Rice. After 60mins an incorrect bill was placed on the table with a request to pay. I ignored this request & continued to finish the meal & after several more requests I pointed out that I had been charged for tea we had not consumed & requested another bill. This was produced after much huffing & puffing & the most obnoxious body & facial language I have ever experienced from the extremely rude waiting staff.We finished our meal within the 75mins but when I asked for the credit card payment machine I was told that was NOT possible because it was attached to a cord in the kitchen & I would have let them have my credit card or pay using cash.I refused both options & eventually a more senior member of staff came to our table & asked me to accompany her to the kitchen where I could use their fixed credit card payment machine. This slow process resulted us sitting at the table for more than 75mins.This was a totally unsatisfactory & unpleasant experience with the barely average but still expensive food being served by particularly offensive table serving staff & we will NEVER return!!!There are several other restaurants with similar names in Singapore but I strongly advice everybody reading this review should remember the address & eat elsewhere.

We visited on A busy Friday night and had the signature chilly crab, and trimmings, the chilli crab was excellent but the 'trimmings' rice etc didn't arrive, despite asking for it several times--we were forgotten, until the bill arrived and we were charged for it. Sadly many of the waiting staff appeared to have other things on their minds and clearly didn't want to be working on a Friday night,

Food was delicious and the menu had everything local. We had the Chilli Crab which was my husbands favourite and he is still going on about it. The best dining experience in Singapore.
5
Great variety of seafood, nice ambiance and service. highly recommended place if you would want to enjoy good quality seafood.
5
Loved the Chilli Crab and seafood rice at Jumbo. Make a reservation before you visit to avoid disappointment and wait. Portions are great. This was one of the best Chilli crab Ive had. Great staff and service too
5
Great location on the water. You need to book a table in advance online as very busy. The crab is delicious!

I went with a work colleague to Jumbo's and expected great things. The main problem was probably my colleague not liking spicy food and so we didn't have any chilli crab. What we did have (live prawns & a grumpy looking fish from the tank) was nice but not exceptional & was very expensive even for Singapore ($100 no drinks)We also sat outside against the window as we were refused a larger table near the water. We ate late and no one much came after us. You are paying more for being by the river. If you can't see it, what's the point?!The service (as with a lot of Singapore) had a lot left to be desired. I won't bother to return.

We went here as we had heard about their infamous Chilli crab. As we didn't have a reservation we put our name down and despite the crowd only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table for two. Service was OK. We were served very quickly and food came out shortly after but we definitely weren't treated like we were anything special. No smiles, small chit chat etc. We were disappointed with our table which was located outside, at the very back right next to the bins and stacks of chairs. The food was good but for the price we paid we would have liked a nicer surrounding. A tip for future diners: BOOK AHEAD to ensure a nicer table.

One of the best branches of the Jumbo Seafood chain. Located at the end of Boat Quay (there are plenty of seafood restaurants when you walk from the Raffles Place MRT to this outlet, don't bother to try those), is one of THE restaurants that you must visit when you come to Singapore. Prices are reasonable and serving is just the price you pay. Chili crab is a MUST in your order list, ask for less spicy if you can't take chilli well. Order both the steam and fried buns to dip in the sauce. Fried baby squids, bamboo clams, donut with seafood paste, black pepper crabs, steam crabs, butter crabs if you run out of ideas of what to order.The restaurant is always full, so booking is a must! You will receive an SMS for your booking once it is confirmed. Otherwise you will have to try your luck if walk in. There is another branch across the road behind the Central shopping mall in Clark Quay but likewise it is equally crowded too!Prices are listed on the menu, except for the shell seafood which are charged by their weight. Do let the waiter know if you are on a budget when ordering so that he can recommend the appropriate crab size. Enjoy and you won't regret

A surprisingly small menu but all seafood of course. The chilli crab was delicious, very messy of course but just hog in. We went on a Friday night with no reservation but could share a big table with two other groups. We had to finish by 8:15 but had plenty of time. The service could have been a little more efficient as twice we had to remind the waitress that two dishes that we had ordered were left waiting on the serving table getting cold. However the tea service was continual and very welcome. Not cheap but not overly expensive considering the quality and size of the crab we ate
4
Such a buzz, whole area just full of restaurants but Jumbo Seafood Riverside Point stands out a the 'Must Visit' seafood experience. Lost count of the number of dishes at our table but no complaints, great service and lovely food.Certainly recommend fo a good fun night out
5
We've made a reservation two weeks ago, with start time 6pm. When we arrived there, there are many people waiting and all of them have the reservation for 6pm. The meal is great. We ordered Chili Crab, the most famous one. Service is good and river view is also good. The only issue is that we have to finish before 7:15pm because next round reservation starts from 7:15pm

We had been looking forward to finally having the great Singaporean dish, chilli crab, and decided to try what looked like a very busy and fun restaurant, Jumbo Seafood. I won't even try to describe it all, it is enough to say it turned out to be like the worst fast food experience but with silver service pricing. Firstly we had to wait ten minutes for our table, despite a reservation, and then were told what time we had to be out by. The menu wasn't priced- seasonal prices apply, always a bad sign. So we asked 'how much is the chilli crab'. Given the Formica tables and high turnover I audibly gasped when he said $78 for a kilo (enough to share if you have other dishes). He then suggested we could have the (slightly) less expensive Alaskan crab. We ordered that, as we were now committed and looking forward to the chilli crab. For some inexplicable reason they proceeded to remove the crab crackers from our table, so that when our meal was delivered we had no cutlery, no napkins, and nothing to crack the shell with. After a bit of gesturing we got the crackers back, and to be honest the dish was very tasty, but with no cutlery you can imagine the mess we needed up with- we both resorted to using the table cloth to wipe our hands as nobody was forthcoming with napkins despite me obviously dripping with chilli sauce! We also had a bowl of really yummy sauce left, but nothing to eat it with or mop it up with. Oh and did I mention the tiny finger bowl with about a centimetre of water in it. Seriously. No one was washing anything in there. The minute we finished fighting the crab I asked for the bill and left, hungry and covered in chill crab. Go somewhere more local and down to earth
4
Looked very busy from the outside, I think always a good sign and we love seafood. Had a 10 minute wait for a table, but that was fine, the speciality dish a lot of people seemed to be having was chilli crab, so thought we should give it a go, and we are glad we did, with our own little aprons it's quite a messy dish, but well worth it! Can you get this in the U.K anywhere , if so please let me know.....
4
What! But I was working nearby, just for a few days, and didn't want a heavy meal at lunchtime. So I ordered other dishes, mostly from the entree menu. Very enjoyable! And so much fun to watch the chili crab circus - beautiful, delicate young women hoeing in energetically; noisy groups of businessmen sweating over the spicy food; little kids being taught the Right Way to eat The Signature Dish. Service was polite and prompt, and it was a rollicking way to have lunch
4
Chilli crab is the pride of this restaurant. But also very expensive. Good location near the famous Clarke Quay - great of drinks after the dinner.These are what we had:2kg of chilli crab8 pieces of man tou (Chinese buns to dip into chilli crab sauce)1 small fried seafood hor fun1 small stir-fried water spinach with sambal2 mugs of Tiger beersEndless supply of Chinese teaSGD210.00Definitely a place I will bring someone special to entertain, but not to have it frequently
3
I had a chilli crab with fried mini buns and live prawn cereals. The food were just fine but the services were poor and it was quiet noisy. The price was S$ 93.7 for two. I heard it's the best chilli crab restaurant in Singapore but I think it's overrated.

If the management of Jumbo Seafood Restaurant would be listening to its young and older customers it would just need to remove the sharkfin soup from its menu and kitchens and be Singapore's best restauranst for dinners with family and friends!Sharkfins are cut from the sharks and the body of the sharks is thrown with no care back into the sea, where the sharks drown and die. This action not only jeopordizes future shark populations, but also affects the ENTIRE marine life/Eco cycle. This is a disgrace to humanity and a crime in some countries. Hong Kong has abondoned this cruelty. Indonesia's Garuda Airways has stopped cargo flights carrying sharkfins. Singapore's Jumbo Seafood can take such actions too and not wait for government policy to take actions. By the way, Singapore Government must also change its law!Jumbo Seafood Restaurant does not show any respect to its customers and seems to be in a state of denial and arrogance. The management also demonstrated that it does not read or respond to its customers views. My son had sent several politely written emails, but no response. You may not need to agree with all your cutomers, but you should have the strength to respond and articulate what guides you and your people to sell cruelty in your restaurant.The Jumbo Seafood Restaurant offers a truly wide variety of dishes, including vegetarian dishes. We eat vegetarian food. Good drinks and tea. Staff is friendly and very service oriented, even at times when the restuarant is highly occupied. At the sea shore of Singapore, the breeze makes the dining perfect. I used to take my business guests and family there, but now avoid this restaurant. If Jumbo Seafood Restaurant fails to take action this crime could be reported in several media sources around the world and in this region. Humans with common knowledge of their foodchain will stop going for dinner here

We saw 2 branches of the restaurant along the river at Clarke Quay. Both were crowded with diners and had lines. Every table had at least 1+ Chili crab on the table with montao accompaniment. The main ingredients are hairy crab, their own chili paste, ketchup & eggs. As a national dish of Singapore, this was an immediate hit with a nicely balance of sweet, spicy, salt, sour in a thick sauce perfect for dipping (we ate all the sauce). We also had their garlic steamed shrimp, also very good, maybe just a little too much garlic. Service was not fast and not very friendly but it is their CC/food that keeps people coming. While we have no experience with Chili crab at other restaurants, Jumbo is a sure place for perfectly cooked Chili crab

I was introduced to this restaurant by a friend during my trip to Singapore. We had lunch there from 13h30-14h30 with one chilli crab - the signature dish, some kang kong, fried rice and some buns, costing us $152. This is the most expensive price ever during my trip.What is more disturbing is the attitude of service. Serving was slow and the waiters are careless in their placement of foods and utensils: when we asked for a bowl to eat rice, a waiter gave us 4 bowls, so hard that one friend had to complain: "as if he was throwing the bowls at us."Food are ok but to me not so outstanding enough to justify the price and the servic
4
We have heard that Jumbo is always busy and have long queued reservations but our Hotel has secured a Monday lunch booking just a day earlier. We were the first couple of tables so had the chance to relax and did receive service which surprised me as I saw a lot of reviews complaining of their poor service. They do charge tea and nuts however not to our concern, and actually this is cheaper than other restaurants we had during this trip. We ordered Chilli Crab with Fried buns, Steamed Snapper and Mixed Veggies. The food came very quick and we dug straight into the meaty crab. It was yum, especially the sauce, went so well with the rice and buns. We think we can still go for another one crab. The Snapper though, not a good pick. It was a bit overcooked and pricy compared to the famous crab. Overall a good experience except it took a long time to pay the bill via credit card
3
Food is fine. I had my first pepper crab here but would think it didn't worth the price and trouble getting to the restaurant. Other comments on the service were so true: they charged you for the tea and nuts even you rejected them; and staff was polite if you talk to them but they're indifferent cruising around, working perhaps, in general.We got seated indoors and the room temperature was too low. The dishes and crab got cold very soon
3
I saw the restaurant from the cruise boat. Then i decide to go for a dinner the. Place is crowded. There service not that much but my order was good steamed fish with steamed rice
4
Present the delicious food in Singapore U have to eat. Chinese style in variation cooks. The Chinese food & seafood here, in Jumbo is the best in Singapore. Let's try to take some dinner, U have to queue because many people like to eat here.
4
Nice environment and food! There is a wide variety of seafood and other food to choose from. I was most impressed with the chilli crab.
The food is on the pricier side though.
2
Waiting for a table - bad service and food that is ok but not special. I was wondering why this place is this famous ?
3
Busy restaurant, try to make reservations before going, Many of the traditional Singapore food. Chilly crab (red chilly/black pepper) and other seafood. The environment depends on the location.Normally is very busy and people talking.Dempsey and East Coast park may be a plus due to the location, up to your convenience
4
It's a nice place to go for an informal dinner; it' s at reiverside point, a nice view but not excellent. It's always full of people and once you try the crab you understand why: amazing. But hard to eat without getting really dirty, they give you huge napkin to place around the neck and... off you go!!! Unfortunately the staff is pretty rude and in a rush, so they were bringing our dishes away while eating, and had to stop them physically, they charge ANYTHING, peanuts, glasses of tea that they pour without asking.. anything! but still it is worth it and really cheap: 1kg of crab 30 S

We arrived later in the evening at Jumbos after a river tour and decided to dine on the famous chillie crabs we had heard so much about. We had to share our table with locals which was fine but noticed a distinct difference in the service we received not to mention the price tag. A small bowl of peanuts on the table, tea was just poured without asking if we wanted it and our friend wanted a glass of house wine of which she received the most expensive glass on the menu $16 for a half glass. House wine being $10. When the bill came around we were charged for 6 bowls of rice and we only ordered 3, the wine issue, peanuts were charged and the tea. As we didn't want it obviously this is a standard charge and it just get poured without asking. You need to be very aware of the Rip off that is going on at this restaurant obviously with the tourists. The locals we shared the table with came in after us and received their meal before us and the staff gladly helped them with their napkins when we were completely overlooked. The meal was ok but nothing to rave about. Nothing is free or complimentary at this restaurant. Very disappointed Jumbos

We went to Jumbo Riverside for the chilli crab and we weren't disappointed with what was served - in fact all the food we ate was excellent. However, there were some negatives that dragged down the overall rating. First, we were disappointed that despite making a booking and arriving on time, there was no reserved table for us, and we were consequently placed at a recently vacated, uncleared table behind a pillar in a high service traffic area. This really detracted from the evening. Secondly, the price of wine was way over the top. This dinner was a celebration and we would have had wine with our meal except for the price. To illustrate, a bottle that could be bought in Australia for around $15 was being offered at Jumbo for well over $100. I understand the different tax and cost arrangements etc, but this level of price difference does not in my opinion represent good value for money. Thirdly, the service was just OK, although to be fair the restaurant was busy. It employs a large number of people who have very specific jobs. But once a table has been served, it is essentially forgotten. It therefore took us quite some time to order an extra dish, and then that order was forgotten and we had to reorder. They definitely could do better in this area

I had heard plenty about the must-try chilli crab at Jumbo and looked forward to my visit here with a self-professed Singaporean foodie. I was far from disappointed.LocationJumbo has a nice view of the river alongside it. It is interesting to sit here and watch people milling around across Reading Bridge and Clark Quay. There are tables all along the pavement adjoining the river. While this makes for an interesting view, it proves to be a bit of a nuisance if you don't like passersby eyeing your food and watching you eat crabs as they walk past. Also, if it happens to rain, prepare to be unceremoniously shunted into the middle of a corridor in the busy, noisy building nearby as the tables have no umbrellas or shelters of any kind. Food & DrinkThe hype around the chilli crab served here (with non-complimentary mantou bread) is well deserved. It was delicious. Too little is said about the pepper crab served at Jumbo. The pepper crab, in my opinion, far outshone the chilli crab. If you have to choose between the two, I'd suggest you opt for the pepper crab. The fruity mango cocktail I'd ordered was also well made and went well with the food. AmbianceSince Jumbo is smack bang in the middle of a busy walkway, be prepared to have strangers gawking at your food (and you) as they walk by. I never thought the sight of big, fat, one-kilo crabs could garner so much attention! The place is noisy and busy. It gets worse when it rains and you're moved into the corridor of the building. ServiceThe attitude of the service staff ranges from polite to indifferent. Given the busy location, it can get difficult to catch the attention of a waiter during your meal. Value For MoneyJumbo is on the expensive side. Be prepared to shell out extra for everything that you would consider 'complimentary' at any other restaurant - peanuts, wet tissues, mantou bread and so on. Go over your bill carefully and ask them to re-calculate your bill if you haven't used any of these 'extras'. You get charged for them by default. Overall ImpressionThe pepper crab leaves a lingering impression. Well worth the hype. The outdoor seating leaves a lot to be desired. Tips for DinersEnsure you make a reservation well in advance (even days or weeks in advance) to avoid being disappointed. Check your bill carefully so that you are not unfairly charged for little extras that you haven't used

Set on the river the restaurant has a beautiful location especially at night with the calm water, lights and the electric bum boats silently passing by.The restaurant was very busy and we where told we must vacate table at a certain time however it was enough time to eat i would have enjoyed staying on for drinks though.I ordered the Chilli crab after reading reviews from others but found it disappointing although very fresh and good size it was lacking flavor. i would recommend long beach main seafood restaurant for both chilli crab and black pepper crab although slightly more expensive the flavor was grea

Crabs, prawn, scallop are all tasty! Even side dishes, vegetables are delicious. Very good services.
4
Had a lovely meal at the Jumbo restaurant at Clark Quay. The service was not that great, but we were so busy eating the delicious crab, we didn't really mind.
3
We ate there last Thursday night - our last night in Singapore and a birthday celebration. We ordered chilli crab and pepper and salted crab - both were delicious. However, I fail to see why they need to charge you for peanuts not ordered and not eaten. We thought they were complimentary. Also the hot tea which we didn't drink and certainly didn't order. Our bill was $140 odd and included 2 Coronas. The unfriendly staff are only interested in getting you out as quickly as possible, ready for the next sitting. There is no atmosphere - more like a food court with shared tables. Good food but overall a disappointing experience. I would not return
4
If you find it is difficult to balance the budget and sea food quality, Jumbo is a great choice. The black pepper crab is highly recommended. Well the chilli crab is tricky - for westners, it could be perfect, but it is bit over sweet for Asians. It is not bad. The view of this restaurant can vary greatly...you can be seated at river side, which is really lucky; or you can be located indoors - be mindful of the aircon which can make you really uncomfortable. Anyway, you cannot choose where to dine as you are led to the table. Would recommend to make reservation hours earlier. Otherwise, you will have to wait for long, plus you need to finish the meal before a time they set for you. It is really funny
4
You can eat the chili crab here, a traditional Singaporean dish. If you don't like chili you can ask the waiter for a different version of crab. The live shrimp is a good option as well. Be prepared to pay a little bit more for the crab
4
Let me start this by saying I am allergic to seafood. This visit to Jumbos was purely to surprise my partner with famous chilli crab. And they didn't disappoint. My partner ended up with an entire pot of chilli crab for himself- and finished the whole lot! Now he can eat a lot of hot and spicy food, but towards the end he started burning up. To this day he says that it was the greatest food experience ever. And it would want to be. It was quite expensive (70SGD for the crab alone) but was totally worth it. I had a large portion of the duck and mango salad (with strict instructions to not place it anywhere near seafood) and I really enjoyed it along with a couple of the pepper lamb cutlets. The beer was also the cheapest we found in Singapore. Great food, great ambiance (with all the lights from Clarke Quay and sitting under the night sky on a balmy evening) and an all round great experience
4
Yes, this is part of a chain, but Singapore style, which means that it doesn't show in the quality of the food that is being served. It was a particularly balmy night, somewhat heavy because of the ever thickening haze, but that didn't dampen our delight at tucking into the famous chilli crab, for which one is properly attired in a bib, which gets thoroughly soaked by the time you've finished -- think Texas Chainsaw Massacre! The Chinese starters were flavoursome but it's all about the crab, which was cooked to perfection, and consumed with alacrity. The fried rice was a nice accompaniment, as was the Tiger beer (you'll need the liquid to douse the flames!). It is an extremely busy place and a favourite for families, so seating is not always prime, whereas the service is sometimes a bit rushed. But it's all about the food and that's first-rate
4
I did find it interesting that there was two jumbo seafood less than 10 min apart. Beyond being expensive it was pretty good. I like the chili crab some at table liked pepper more. One spicier the other more Asian flavors. Fried rice bombSweet fried fish bombSkip the duck in crepe wrap not worth it
4
Jumbo is a chain restaurant which I suppose may account for the variety of reviews. We however found it to a good standard, reasonably priced (given the location) and the service was fine. I don't think you can get crab for one; hence with only one of us liking crab there was a serious mission to finish the whole one we ordered! There is plenty for non-seafood members of te party.
4
Having visited Singapore many times before we always go to Jumbos at least once for dinner to have the famous Chilli Crab. Its not cheap I have to admit but the crab is just delicious especially when you include their great rice, fried buns and a beautiful fruit platter to end the meal. We have always found the service fast and if you can get a table riverside(try and request it although they wont guarantee) its just lovely. We did find this year we had to book at least a couple of days ahead instead of just the day before which we have in the past and each night they were turning many away who had not booked
4
The best chili and black pepper crabs I've ever had. The outdoor seating had loads of ambience but sitting outside also means the bugs will be sharing your food. Everything was great except for the bugs and the time limit set for the meal.
1
Let's be honest 'Jumbo' is a highly overprized fastfood. So is the service and food quality. We had cod, jellyfish,prawns salad and fried rice and,comparing to other- much humble places, it was uneatble. Fish was obviously frozen ( obviously means that the ' fridge smell' was very intense), salad was made of three small prawns covered by the huge amount of mayo and all that for over 150 S$! And if it has been at least tasty..:/ Never again
5
Every time I am in Singapore I go here to eat the fabulous black pepper crab at this amazing place. Last night we had a wonderful feast at an outside table on the banks of the Singapore River. The crab is a must - it is big, cooked perfectly and full of juicy, delicious meat. I also recommend their steamed fish in black bean sauce and the kai lan in garlic sauce. If you order wine you take your chances - I have had warm chardonnay and near frozen cabernet sauvignon. Service is rather patchy and offhand. Quite expensive - last night cost us $160 for three seafood and one vegetable dishes
3
We went twice, first time was amazing! Loved it so much we went back but unfortunately was not as good. It was later in the night and the crab came out fast which was the first worry. The parts of the crab sitting in the sauce were warm but the rest cold and it was also smaller than the first one. Whethe bill came it was almost twice the cost of the first one we had! They said we had a different kind of tab this time which we didn't know about or ask for. Eventually they gave us money off the bill but said we had to let them know next time, I said its the waiters job to tell us! We are the customer! Anyway, would go again but make sure you know what your getting and don't go too late
4
A very authentic, Singapore experience. Actually the best seafood I ate all week (and I stayed at a 5 star hotel). Had a great, riverside table. The crab was to die for (had the black pepper crab) and the fat noodles were amazing. Also had the spicy cod. I really enjoyed this Singapore staple. Even better, i had only previously been to their other location and this location was so much better. A must do Singapore dining experience
4
My regular place for having crab fiesta. I personally like their black pepper one than the chili one, but jumbo is always famous for the chili crab with Mantau bun. Please order the seafood frice rice and their sambal kang kong vegetables. Service not too bad, waiting time not to bad. You have to make a reservation, otherwise you will have to wait for almost one hour to get a table. They have many branches in Singapore,however I always like the taste at jumbo riverside and east coast seafood
3
Four of us went to this restaurant on a Monday night, the booking girl at reception was downright rude,not a good start. We came because our taxi told us it was good seafood. Some of the food was better than others, but you always had the feeling that they threw the food at you each time it came- not a relaxing experience. It reminded me of a busy cafe back home, food ok,but nothing special,and all the time felt rushed to hurry up and vacate the table. Call me strange but when I go for a meal I like to enjoy the whole experience, good food, atmosphere, quality wine and not feel rushed. Sadly for me it was non of the above, and the food was not that special. I think very ordinary for Singapore
4
My local friends come here when they want the best chili crab that you don't have to wait in line (queue) for. This means it is actually way down the list and is much more expensive, but it's the best you are going to get at a convenient place. Don't do this on a weekend night, though.
4
You will have to booked first if you want to go jumbo crab at clarke quay on the weekend. But the waiter inform us that there is also jumbo seafood riverside by 15 minutes walking distance from Clarke quay. There is not much view to see, but I don't think it's a problem since you will focus on eating the crab anyway. The service is fast and waiter is friendly. A little bit pricey but it's worthed
4
We walked around the Clarke Quay area and found the place too loud to enjoy a good meal, and than crossed over the Singapore River through a foot-bridge and decided to dine in at Jumbo Seafood, which was recommended to us and we had also seen it pretty busy during our walk around the river the previous day.The restaurant was packed around 8pm, even though it was a weekday and yet we were promptly helped to a table which was just got vacant. The staff were helpful and offered advice on the menu and we went for the "Chili Crab" (which was previously recommended) along with some sweet bun. The waiting staff took care to cover our shopping bags, and they also provide you with plastic covers to cover your fronts.The Crabs are served by weight and the smallest is a kilogram, with a serving good for 2. The food was delicious and done well.By the time we were done around 9:30ish, the tables were half-full and it was less chaotic. Would recommend that if you are particular about service, wait until 9 for dinner on a weekday, and you wouldn't be disappointed
4
Jumbo is one of those places everyone seems to mention or reccomend. It is a huge operation and I would liken it to something like quan je da or da dong duck restaurants in China. Alot of reviews seem to make special mention of the slow service but our experience was actually very good in terms of speed and efficiency. We dined on a tuesday night.My wife thought the chilli crab had an extra dimension to others she had tried in Singapore, I felt this was simply a cayenne style chilli kick rather than the sometimes bland chilli of other less expensive establishments.I had scallops in XO sauce and codfish with scallions and ginger. The scallops were actually very good the codfish just ordinary. We were given a free side dish due to the waitress accidently bringing it to our table by mistake which was a lovely hospitalty touch however this was over ridden by Jumbo charging us for the small bowl of peanuts that we most definately did not order but did eat presuming them free. ( our fault admitidly)Visit Jumbo just as you would the singapore flyer, because your there because everyone else seems to have been there and you will then have something to talk about with almost everyone that has ever been to singapore
3
Yes that would be pricey. Had lunch here and found the Chili Crab to be quite tasty but also pretty pricey. Singapore is a expensive city so I need to try and calibrate a bit but in the end I come back to say that the experience was not worth the price. They served tea when we sat down along with a very small dish of peanuts. They did not ask the just served. When the bill came we see that they charged for each item. We also had a starter of duck and veggies that was good and a main of scallops that was also good.So no complaint with the food or the service but the price left a bad taste in my mouth
4
The restaurant was very busy, so booking is a must. We found that the Chilli Crab is the best we had for the whole trip to Singapore, freshest, and cooked beautifully. However, other things we ordered were good, and we think Dempsy is better. Service was a bit confused at the start and haven't got the personal touch as Dempsy, but still efficient.We will definitely be back for our next trip
3
There's always a queue, so be prepared to wait. We wanted to have chili crab, frankly there are a lot of places but Boat Quay tends to be more touristy than this. The staff came to take our order way past 20 mins of us being seated. The crab was good, slightly less sweet than other places- which is good. But try the black pepper crab which is better. The staff forgot to serve us the steamed buns, which we could see we're lying on the counter for 10 mins. They served it cold, and when we said they've been lying there for a long time, they said ' well it's here now'. !! Really terrible service. The food at Jumbo is generally good, the prawns and squid and other seafood items are worth a try. But there are many Jumbo's in Singapore, try not to go to this one at Riverside Clarke Quay. You'll have a better experience elsewhere. (No Signboard Restaurant has just opened in Central close by to this Jumbo- it's much better)

Great atmosphere. Chilli crab a must albeit a seasonal price paid per kilo weight - we seem to think it was 56$ per kilo & each crab was a kilo !. Side orders of sweet buns ( small ) or rice a good idea but it all depends on how hungry you are ....Must book & don't be too late as after 9.00pm they sztart to clear the tables away !!!!!.Good luc

Had a girls' night-out on Thursday. One of my friends booked a table for six a few days in advance but when we arrived, we realized the staff had mixed up our reservation. Luckily my friend had taken note of the reservation ref number so we managed to get a table by the river.The restaurant was very busy on a week night but the staff taking order and serving were friendly and helpful. However some of the staff appeared to be from PRC and conversed in Mandarin which we could understand but may pose a problem for non-Chinese speaking guests as their command of English was not very good.We ordered chilli crab which was served in a pan with lots of gravy, not too spicy nor sweet with steamed and fried man-tou (buns) to mop up the gravy. However both crabs were too big at around 1.1kg to 1.2kg each so the crab dish itself cost nearly S$130 excluding ++. At $56 per kg, this was considered very expensive. When my friends wanted 2 crabs, we didn't realize that we would be given crabs that would weigh over a kg each. Well we know better, in future just order 1 crab should be enough as we had 6 other dishes. Alternatively ask for smaller crabs. I enjoyed the boiled live prawns as we could taste the freshness of the prawns. This dish came with a dip of chilli and soya sauce. Other dishes we ordered were baby kailan fried in garlic (simple and tasty), deep fried baby squid, fried youtiao (fritters in cuttle fish paste) fried just right and not soggy, venison with spring onions and fried mee goreng which was a bit too sweet. The total bill came to around S$300 including peanuts, 2 bowls of rice, tea, towels, service charge and taxes. It was a bit on the high side because of the crabs and prawns.The Riverside branch of Jumbo is centrally located near Clarke Quay MRT station and The Central shopping mall. Do ask for a table by the river to dine alfresco style. The view along the river is lovely at night. There are pubs and drinking places across the river at Clarke Quay

Chili crab is a must if you visit Singapore and Jumbo sea food is the place to eat it. . We went to the one by Riverside Point. It's conveniently located downtown, but the East Coast one has a nicer atmosphere. Remember to book in advance... Order the fried buns to dip in the sauce. Baby Kailan is also nice. If you are more than two, add a Pepper Crab

We were told we had to try Jumbo Seafood when we were in Singapore so we took a taxi one night and went to Riverside Point (opposite Clarke Quay). We hadn't booked so was very lucky to be able to get a table (for 8 people). The chilli crab was really good - had a good kick to it. Definitely order the fried buns to soak up the remaining chilli crab sauce. You should also try the fried baby squid. The meat was good - if we were to go back to the restaurant again (next trip to Singapore), I probably would not order meat again (or I should say I would order less because the lamb cutlets were very expensive). Overall we were glad we tried Jumbo. The staff were attentive and made the experience very enjoyable

I understood from friends that Jumble is as good as anywhere to try the famous Singapore chili crab. We chose this location because it is within walking distance from our hotel at Clarke Quay, and it was a pleasant evening to be seated outdoors by the river. There was so much sweet chili sauce (not too spicy as to mask the delicious taste of fresh crab) that we decided to order some plain rice to mob up some of it. The sauce was not thin as a reviewer mentioned. We also ordered baby Kai Lan (green Chinese vegetable) and scallops in fried yam nests, both good. My husband had Tiger beer. The bill came to just under $120, which was quite acceptable. Service was attentive. Booking is essential.

This is no doubt a popular chili crab experience in Singapore, be it amongst the locals or with the tourists.I advise all to call 2 days in advance to reserve your table during dinner hours, otherwise there is high chance you will be left disappointed without a seat.Pair your chili crab with fried mantous and Tiger beer, to complete the dining experience. Don't worry about the spice - the sauce is more sweet than spicy

Have high hope, but end up disappointed. Very salty for the pepper crab.
Miss the one i ate at Long Beach years ago. :(

Like - Service and food
Dislike - Price - overpriced
Baby Kailan was great, Pepper Crab - very good. A little disappointment on the Chili Crab. Other than that - like it.

It's almost impossible to get a reservation during dinner time if you book on the day itself.. I only managed to get a table 2 days in advance.The restaurant was at Clarke Quay, and they served the all famous Chili Crab, which did not disappoint. Order the fried buns to dip into the sweet and spicy chili sauce. It was a fun dining experience, everyone was given paper bibs! Good way to end off the trip in Singapore and indulge in good food

By far, this is the most delicious chili crabs I have ever tasted. My friend and I went there on a friday night. I knew there were lots of people in that restau considering its friday and its within clarkey area. Nevertheless, we dine and order their famous chili crabs. Pro- Getting in the restau is done in an orderly manner. You get a number and everyone is queued. So that's good to avoid being mobbed, since they always have a lot of people coming in. On Food: Big crabs! Tasty and spicy (just the right kind of spice) and they also serve big portions for our other orders. In fact, my friend happens to not eat crabs, so I finished all of it by myself! And love their complimentary tea. It's jasmine, smells refreshing!Con- For an expensive restau such as this, I don't expect to share tables with other people. Unfortunately, that's how they arrange seats here. They all have big tables inside and outside the restau that can sit 8 people. Though they serve and take orders separately. It felt like we don't have privacy during mealtime and when we converse, although they don't mind and they don't care what your talking about but everyone talking all at the same time is noisy.In our case, that's 4 different set of people. Not being used to be stared at while I eat my meal (though everybody's staring at everybody) you can get a lil conscious of eating while struggling to fight the shells of the crabs, anyway seafoods with shell is always messy to eat. If you don't like that idea then take out your dinner for goodness sakes! Or just go their with 8 of your friends, make your table exclusive, you can enjoy both the food and each other company.But overall, I will definitely come back

I think the best thing to eat here is crab, we had the chilli crab which was very good. We also had the black pepper crab which was nice but a little too salty. There was also no sauce that came with this. We tried some other dishes but were not overly impressed. A couple of complaints, they gave tiny finger bowls which were not changed. No paper serviettes but scented refresher towels. These are disgusting as they scent stays on your fingers and tastes horrid. Also for some reason although we had made a reservation a few weeks prior we got one of the 4 tables with no tablecloth, with the crab everything got a bit sticky and nasty.Would I come back? Maybe after trying the other alternatives or maybe not...

For full review with pics:http://princessandangmoheatsg.blogspot.sg/2013/01/jumbo-seafood-riverwalk.htmlCame here one might for a friend's going away party. Got lucky and was sent to a table instantly, rather than the party ahead of us who had to wait 45 mins. This jumbo seafood restaurant is at Riverwalk, across from Clark Quay and on the water still. This night we got a table outside but still under cover, the rain had just stopped also. Since we had a few other people in our party, we ordered a bit more food than usual and it turned out to be just enough. The black pepper crab was the single best item ordered. The crabs overall seemed a bit small compared to Spring Court but not bad still. The chili crab was OK but the sauce was a bit thin and definitely not as good as East Coast or Spring Court. The fried buns were delicious as always (but are these ever bad? anywhere??), the kang kong tasted the same and the fried rice was good too, nothing especially good though. An enjoyable meal overall but not the best of anything

Went to JS based on a referral from a friend and wasn't disappointed. My wife and I both ordered a chilli crab each, a bottle of NZ wine and two sides for c200 SGD which we thought was a good price as this included taxes and service charge.The staff were fantastic and were attentive.Tip - book a table a day beforehand and ask to sit outside (inside is fine but outside is a better experience)

Actually we went to the branch of Jumbo seafood near Statdium (but i can't find that one on tripadvisor). My SG friend booked the table in advance for 730pm Fri and we were arranged at Sofa table indoor (its outdoor is more popular and occupied by foreign guests but I prefer indoor give the hot humid weather). We ordered 1 chili crab using Canada crab (i/o Sri Lanka Crabs per waiter's suggestion saying canada crab meat is more tender and smooth) together with several other signature dish of the restuarant. The crab itself is a bit small, only 1KG and thus not feed up our appetite. And we decided to order another pepper crab using sri-lanka crab later on. Crab itself is fresh and cooked in very special way, the chili sauce is very unique not that spicy more alike curry but served well with ordered fried bread. Pepper crab is much strong in flavor and in dry texture. Personally, i prefer chili crab but my friend's pick is pepper crab. Other dishes were yummy as well but not that special compared to Crabs (almost ordered by every table). Environment is good and service is excellent too. Overall i rate it better than Long Beach

We went on the advice of a taxi driver, the food was nice and tasty, our waiter was very good, I do agree with other comments about charging for the nuts on the table.The place is very busy, one thing that does put you off before you even sit down is the card they give you, this card has a time that they want you to leave by, we arrived at 8pm our card wanted us out by 9.15pm, hasten to say we ignored the request however the staff didn't and kept hovering around and over pouring the jug of beer I had, took one sip and they proud more into your glass.The majority of customers appeared to be locals, as usual around Clarke Quay the booze is astronomically priced, $27 for a jug of tiger beer.The chilli crab was good but expensive, if you want this dish suggest you go into Chinatown.One chili crab, one medium sized prawn dish, one vegetable dish, two small steamed rice, jug of beer and a coconut based non alcoholic drink came to Â£86.0

It is one of the easiest bet for a nice relaxing night out with friends or partner, where you don't want to spend too much and be in a casual environment. The outdoor seating is overlooking Clarke Quay and the river, so it does have its charm. Being positioned in such location it also offers nearby alternatives in case you want to go somewhere close for a drink after dinner.The quality of the food is definitely above average and at a good value for money. We were not rushed off in order to make room for more guests so we did have a beautiful evening under a clear Singapore sky. This wasn't the first time we have been to this restaurant, so we kind of knew what we were going for and as usual we were not disappointed as once more we went through a very pleasant experience of local seafood delights.If you are after something consistent in terms of quality of food, a good casual environment and a nice location, then this is the place

Chilli Crab was well worth the mess! Yummy!!! Don't be embarrassed about wearing the bib either, everyone does it!

Singapore Mud crab and chilli crab - YUM! Place is busy as ever. Remember to make a booking or arrive early, there's usually a line!

We were given a table even though the restaurant was fully booked, only waited about 5 minutes but the meal was so good it would have been worth waiting a lot longer.

Such was the disappointment, I cannot remember much more than battering my way through a chilli crab with a Tiger beer close to hand.
My work colleagues raved about Jumbo, but I cannot see why. It was a pricey, crowded and altogether forgetable experience.
Avoid.

This was our third visit to Jumbo's over a period of 5 years and it remains to have very good chilli crab but without it I probably would'nt go.It's not the easiest place to get a table during busy periods and the feel of the restaurant is more of a fast food establishment. The menu is quite varied and of course the star is the chilli crab - you look around and see most people have it on their table - which says it all. The description may put some people off though as it isn't that hot as chilli sauce goes - a very well balanced sauce - which unfortunately gets everywhere as you eat!The rest of the menu we have tried is more average and each time we've visited we have ended up having starters delivered after he main course and the side dishes arriving first of all. So if you like chilli crab please go. If you don't then probably try somewhere else

My wife and I went here on a Saturday night around 9pm, no reservation, the place was packed, but they still found us a spot in the back. We ordered the Chilli crab, the prawns fried with cereal, and a black pepper crab. everything was amazing. The chilli crab was good, juicy, not spicy, you could taste the sweetness in the crab meat. the prawns fried with cereal were great as well, sweet, almost buttery, and very juicy, no complaints at all. our favourite was the black pepper crab, super peppery, spicy, and yet juicy as well. all in all this was one of the best meals we've had in a long while.its messy eating though, so don't go on your first date

I recently took 3 friends to this Restaurant for a much awaited feed of local mudcrab. They managed to find a table squeezed between the wall and the serving area - admittedly our fault for not booking in advance but our table was hot and noisy and not very conducive to a good dining experience. We ordered drinks first - 3 colas and one drink off the menu. The drink off the menu arrived but was the wrong one and had to be exchanged. Our 3 cola's hadn't arrived so we checked with the waitress who stated that our 3 beers were coming. We reiterated that we had ordered only Cola so she went away to change the order. 5 minutes later one Cola arrived so my friend & I sat there waiting for our drink - we had been there 30 minutes by this time without a drink. It was only after some active discussion with the waitress did we finally get our drinks. Given the drinks drama I checked the food order. We had ordered one serve of pork ribs and 3 serves of Pepper Crab. The order stipulated one pork (which hads already arrived at the table) & one crab order. We asked a supervisor to check our order and he confirmed that 3 crab orders were in the system - you guessed it only one order arrived. We waited a further 15 minutes for our missing crabs and when we asked what was happening with our order they said that we had only ordered one crab. I lost it at this point and asked for the manager who apologised but it was still another 30 minutes before our crabs arrived. What a shambles!!!! The dissapointing thing about this is that we understand that there is a language issue but most Singaporeans speak English but our waitress obviously didn't. Looking at recent reviews this is not an isolated case. You have just lost me as a diner.........

We had to book a table as this place was full of locals. We thought that it was going to be good as it was recommended on a trip advisor post.And of course a place full of locals is always a good sign.We ordered the chili crab - expensive. It tasted ok, but it was not as fabulous as we thought.We ordered some rice - again expensive. $14SGD for a small bowl of rice.now for the worst dining experience ever - i got the bill and was astounded. When we were shown to our seats the table contained a small bowl of nuts as well as chinese tea. I never ordered this and we were not even asked whether we wanted these things. As we were not asked, and as the waitress poured the tea out straight away we never even once thought we would be charged.On the bill we were charged for peanuts as well as tea.So shameful that they think they can get away with this. Please do not go here. There are much better places in Singapore

Big meal with three westerners, a south Asian and a Singapore Chinese. Basically they sent a whole lot of dishes we did not order. We never received any of the drinks we ordered correctly if at all. Despite having a local Chinese person with us they had no idea what vodka was, they could not deliver a Bacardi and coke, or a vodka and soda. Everything had to asked for four and five times. We ordered three prawn issues received 8! The food was though not bad but expensive at 500 Singapore.I paid and left , explaining to manager how poor things were, he offered free desserts, we still never got many of the drinks I paid forThe sea bass was nice despite this will never be back

This is a sort of complaint about the service provided for family dinner on Apr 23, 2012. One of my foreign friend's family visited Singapore for sightseeing combining with Bintan resort package. For an authentic dinner in Singapore, I recommended Jumbo Seafood at Riverside. Because I believe that the place is the best for foreigner who visits Singapore for the first time. However, today, I was shocked when I heard about service he and his family experienced at Jumbo. He ordered additional dishes and he waited for more than half an hour and he tried confirmed his order more than three times, but no dish provided until bill came to the table. While a waitress insisted to pay the bill although the additional order had not served yet. My friend generously paid the bill with great patience and expectation that his family would get their additional order soon. However the dishes did not come up his table, even though he asked twice more. My friend ran out of his patience and complained the situation to the service manager and he fortunately managed to cancel his bill payment and re-paid for only food served.What I want to say here.... Jumbo seafood is a iconic place in Singapore. Also it is not only for food but also for image of Singapore. The service of the restaurant ruined the image of Singapore for my friend case. I hope it was for my friend case only. Otherwise Jumbo would be considered the place against the image of Singapore. Jumbo SHOULD improve its quality of service. Without good service, chili crab you serving is just meal... not a memory
