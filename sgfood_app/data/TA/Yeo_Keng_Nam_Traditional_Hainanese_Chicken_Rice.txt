The restaurant is just by a main highway. Once it must have been quiet here. Staff are friendly & efficient. Food is good. Not cheap but reasonable with good size portions. I liked the traditional food and atmosphere but many would find it too downmarket.

We ordered rice, claypot brinjal, spinach with assorted eggs and the Hainanese pork chop, all of which were well done. The restaurant is small and parking space is extremely limited. You can however order food which is delivered to your home for a small fee.

A hidden find at a nondescript corner at 8 Braddell Rd in a shop house serving juicy, tender chicken, fragrant chicken rice and other side dishes.

Other than limited in space n parking it serves well in product n service in almost everything else. Love white chicken here. Also fish head curry is a Favourite. Been a customer since 1967.

Their famous chicken rice is not the usual food centre kind - not the healthiest type but something you don't forget easily, in a good way. Other dishes are great too. It's a pity the restaurant itself is rather small so there's limited seating capacity. We often call in to order for takeaway. If you can speak Mandarin it'll be helpful to communicate food orders.

I was interested to try YKN because it is included in the list of some bloggers who wrote about the top 10 or top 15 chicken rice in Singapore. And if you want to try Singapore food, chicken rice should be at the top 3 of your list.And they were right. I think it is one of best 5 I've tasted so far. The chicken is pure meat, no unnecessary and frustrating small chicken bones that may damage your gums. This is honest to goodness chicken meat with rice cooked in chicken stock. Best to use 3 types of sauce - sweet soy sauce, ginger sauce and chili, for that added kick. I paired this dish with a small serving of kailan vegetables, which was basically stir fried with garlic. Awesome meal. I don't mind eating this once a week

The last time I visited this joint was last November 2016. How time flies, without knowing it's been more than 6 months. Hainanese chicken rice is probably one of my Favourite meal but besides this joint. U can this dish almost everywhere but whether the chicken is tender, Chilli sauce is good enough to complete an awesome & satisfying meal is something else.Yeo's chicken .... very good n tender, Yeo's very good chilli n ginger a definite adder plus.With three friends. We decided to drop in despite recent bad press about the founder Son belittling a cab driver. The opening hours a joy as we need to eat early to attend an early at 7pm. Order was placed, delivery was timely n all us truly enjoyed a good meal.Highlights : chicken, Ngoh Hiang, shark fin egg omelette was good, bean sprout with salted fish was crunchy n not overcooked. Thai deboned chicken feet was also good. Only disappointment was the tofu. Nothing special really.The meal was reasonably priced @ $92 with drinks for four of us. Service was very good, they deserved the tips to round the meal to $100.I promise I won't wait another 6 months to return.I will be back soon

Visited several times at this very humble old shop house restaurant on 9 June 2017 with a Friend. If you like quiet enjoying your chicken rice go earlier around 6-6.30 pm. Took my Friend there her first and she was so happy having her very tender steamed chicken together with roasted ones. Two of us ordered half steam and mixed with roast chicken, fish maw soup and a spinach with herbal soup. We literally finish every bit of it. Yummy and very hearty. Good chicken rice cannot go without good Chilli cum garlic sauce.Yeo Keng Nam shop has put up new menu and you can order it as set for two to 10 persons. Value for money which we overlook. It is much cheaper if you want to sample the shop's special dishes with curry fish head go for it and they cater for up to ten person's meal.Have did my next booking to bring my friends for a table for ten and get a chance sample even more dishes.Food good and service men very alert with not so nice ambience. Who cares

It's been a few months since I visited this joint. My Sister asked what I like to eat. Without much hesitation, I told her chicken rice. Can always think of two places. Kampong chicken @ Thomson or Yeo keng Nam. Obviously, we decided to opt for Yeo's .... only problem is parking is a turn off. We were lucky enough to find a parking spot. As it was past 8.30pm, place was quiet. Order was delivered to us on the table pretty quickly. Service was good. The pig stomach soup is always a delight to have, very peppery n tasty.WhiteChicken was fat n juicy. Can't fault the texture of the meat. It was very tasty. We had side orders of bean sprout with salted fish was crunchy & not overcooked. Ngoh Hiang was pretty good too together with their recommendation of s bean curd dish. Was ok.Overall, a satisfying dinner. Just for three was simply awesome

Found this place about 4 years ago as we were trying to get lunch, and been coming back many times ever since. Roasted chicken is nicely cooked, and the rice is more fragrant and tasty than the usual Wee Nam Kee that we like to frequent before. Besides this, cai po tofu is good. Also, the Chinese spinach with assorted eggs. Place is decent but rather small. You can't really have a big group dinner here. Parking space is a problem some time. Limited, and it's shared with other establishments around. Another alternative is to call them for home delivery if you feel like having them in the comfort of your house instead.
