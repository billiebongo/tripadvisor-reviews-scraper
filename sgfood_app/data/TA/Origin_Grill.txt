Tasty food that’s value for money in a relaxing ambience. Service was warm and friendly, which added to the enjoyment of the dinner. Shout out to our server, Dylan, who cracked jokes and offered recommendations freely :)

What a refreshing and delicious change for the Shangri La. We went for lunch looking for a break from some of the mainstream restaurants in Orchard Road and Origin did not disappoint!! Fantastic food and service, we had the express lunch special which was exceptional. Chef Heidi came out to mingle with the diners which was an added touch and made for a very special afternoon. I can’t wait to come back for dinner and try more of the amazing food!! Highly recommend as a must do in Singapore.

Friends from Perth were staying at the Shangi-La, so I suggested we have lunch at Origin Grill since I have seen some positive write ups in the local press. What a great dining experience. Not only was the Express Lunch menu great value... but the flavours, presentation and service matched the flavours I experienced in taste - Amazing all round!More than just steak, although my rump today was just to my liking. There is a great choice of other dishes to suit anyones taste. The Octopus starter is yum too!The atmosphere is also good and it was very nice to meet Chef Heidi at the end of her lunch service. Her passion was high and very welcoming. Make sure you say Hi if you get the chance!We will definitely go back for lunch or dinner soon - and highly recommend anyone thinking about visiting doing the same. Might have to go back and try the cocktail bar next time :-

We decided to have a valentines/ birthday meal at the Origin grill, we weren’t disappointed, Absolutely wonderful Dining experience, Food was brilliant and can only try the snow age wagyu here from a certain farm in Japan, sadly I can’t recall the name but I was told by Chef Dan as he came to check how our meal was, he was extremely polite and knowledgable about the food and its sources. Will defiantly return here if I’m back in Singapore! The bar is also wonderful really nice atmosphere to end a marvellous night lots of original drinks showcasing the best of Singapore’s history and districts

Was there with the missus for valentine's day and we were impressed even walking through the entrance. Comfortable decor and great ambience. The food really was the highlight though, everything we ate was absolutely incredible. Perfectly cooked and perfectly balanced, consistently delicious for 4 courses. Chef Heidi came out to meet everyone too which really brought the whole experience to life. Will definitely be going back for every special occasion from now on.One of the best full meals we have ever had in Singapore. WELL DONE HEIDI!!! Your food is magic

There are few places where the hospitality, ambience, and food come together to make such a wonderful dining experience, but the Origin is surely one of those gems. The Express Lunch set is something of a misnomer, we sat down to indulge and enjoy for two and a half hours. This comes at a very value-for-money price, and you definitely get more than what you pay for not just in terms of quality of food, but also for the service. Here I must compliment the staff running the show: the service was warm, unpretentious, yet generous; these the are traits I value the most when dining. Did I mention the food was great? We brought our 3 year old food connoisseur and it passed his standards too which HAS to be good. Panko Cod and Liver Pate appetizer which was delectable, main course of Rump and Wagyu Flank Steak which was perfectly done, and topped off with Chocolate and Strawberry cake which was a wonderful finish. I most heartily recommend The Origin Grill, whether for couples or families, for a business lunch or a special occasion, as I am sure whatever the reason it would be a good one to make a visit to this gem of a restaurant.

First visit for me and some of my colleagues over at Origin. Choose Origin to be the location for a farewell lunch. Service staff was attentive,polite and food are value for money esp "Express Lunch" (3 course at $44++) From the start that we came in and seated,service are prompt. Food came on time on the table. Favourite part of the course was dessert, cake of the day,was nice,sweet and not too heavy. Pretty well goes with tea/coffee. Slight dissappoinment were the tea that was bland. Teapot use quite big for one pax drink. Other than that, overall experience will make us comeback anytime soon. Thank you to Paolo/Paul (im not sure if i got the right name) and team

I found my way into Origin Bar several times during our 3 night stay at the Shangri-La. It was first their decent selection of spirits and trendy atmosphere that drew me in, however, it was the staff that kept me coming back. Each of the staff are exceptional, especially Adam the bar master.They have a decent selection of American and Japanese whisky, along with some exceptional rums. Along with what I ordered, the let me sample a few things during my time there. Sitting at the bar is fun, but they also have private booths where the curtain can be drawn for more intimate cocktails.In addition, they create a lot of their own liquor mixtures for cocktails - the sample of hazelnut chocolate I had was perfection.Origin is definitely worth a stop in for a pre or post dinner cocktail

The menu is pretty extensive, you are most probably able to find something you would like! Unless you are a vegan or vegetarian, then I won't recommend this restaurant to you.I went there with my family and we were served by very attentive and friendly staff. The portions of food were reasonably big, and we especially liked the steak and cod fish. And the fries - Yes. There is a very beautiful bar right next door to head to after your meal if you want to

Had a dinner with my wife. The manager and the staff was very attentive and helpful as my wife required some attention on the food selection due to strict dietary. Consistently checking our table through out the dinner, tried their best to approach every table to make sure they delivered equal service and did some small talk even though the restaurant full at some period. The food was awesome, cod cake,seafood platter should be enough to make sure your tummy fully occupied. Thanks to our service superstar of the night Mr Shaban, Mr Shoban and all the origin grill staff for the wonderful experience
