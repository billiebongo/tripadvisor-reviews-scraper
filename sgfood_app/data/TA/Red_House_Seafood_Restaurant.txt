The hall was too noisy so we could not hear each other. They served quickly but the source was too sweet and weak.
4
Having been recommended the Red House as an alternative to Jumbo we weren’t disappointed. Friendly and professional service, and tasty chilli crab - not cheap, but certainly worth a try.
5
You must go for the Drunken Prawns and Chilli Crab.
Sadly their East Coast Parkway location no longer exists but you can still get their great Chilli Crab at this location.
Attentive staff and a great way spend the evening

As I was then a Regional Director of a large Japanese Multinational is was a customary practice that after extremely tight scheduled business day one is entertained to a luxurious evening out with close Japanese Executives and Managers to outstanding venues for in this case lovely white wine and the iconic crab dish. When I asked the waiter from where they get these dinner plate sized crabs being Sri Lankan I was shocked to be informed that they were from Sri Lanka. When I informed this kind waiter of this fact, he said, I quote "Oh then you must be very used to this dish" I hastened to reply that I have never seen anything like this sized crab in Sri Lanka ever. But I later checked back home in Sri Lanka at the large fish market at that time in Pettah Colombo at 3.40am in the morning and watched these huge crabs being packed professionally in cane baskets to be transported to the International Airport at direct flight to Singapore while still alive. So that anyone visiting this great venue will experience absolutely fresh hence absolutely safe crabs. If you can find the time, a beautiful, professionally managed, yet with an homely ambiance that you will love. A must experience place. Warmest best wishes to the management and staff. You were really lovely.Thank yo

We made reservations and went there for dinner. It wasn't too busy. We ordered 3 dishes and a couple drinks. The first 2 came out really quick, however our 3rd dish took over an hour which was the crab and it was disappointing to say the least. The bill was $200. I would not go there again, as you can find other restaurant with much better seafood and much more reasonable priced
5
We were taken to this restaurant by a local friend who suggested we try the Chill Crab. Being our first time we were looking forward to trying it and were not disappointed. The sauce was delicious and the serve was huge and we did not eat it all. We also tried the drunken prawns which was very good also. Highly recommend, bib needed
4
We visited this restaurant for our first dinner place after afternoon walk at Robertson quay. We enjoyed our dinner because our children ate the food easily. Beside the seafood dishes, we also liked the tofu spinach with mushroom and fresh vegetables such as crunchy asparagus. The prices are average not too expensive.
2
Just visited this restaurant and had the famous Singapore chili crab for 88 bucks. Also had a large order of soft shell crabs. Crab was fresh but it doesn’t have much meat and does not taste good. The soft shell crab tasted greasy and Can’t taste the crab meat at all. Poor meal for the price of over 150 Singapore dollars.  The jumbo seafood restaurant’s chilli crab was much much better, actually delicious for just about 77 Singapore dollars
4
Had chilli crab, with rice and buns. Service was great. Staff very attentive and the bib helped keep us reasonably clean, so did copious amounts of paper napkins. Not the cheapest in town, but well worth every penny. Restaurant was busy, which judging by the standard of the food wasn’t surprising. My wife and I found the helpings huge. Highly recommended

Having read the many previous reviews, we were prepared to love the food and hate the charging for superfluous items such as hand wipes.In fact the handwipe and tea charges were no more than a 'cover charge' which we have seen in many restaurants at home, and the amount was not excessive. The service was fast and efficient if a bit 'food factory' in style. Also every dish came at the same time, although we had ordered them as starter and main course. But frankly the food was indifferent. We didn't have the famous chilli crab but I had the beef with ginger and it was no better than a middling Chinese restaurant standard. I've certainly had better. Other dishes were ok but nothing was stand-out.It's common enough to find restaurants trading on a reputation that is no longer deserved, and I wonder if this is one of them..
4
Had the most amazing sweet chilli crab. The sauce was absolutely delicious and the fried buns were great. Would definitely visit again
5
Attended a business dinner for about 15 people here an it was wonderful! Delicious seafood including pepper crab, chili crab, sweet and sour fish, prawns, scallops and more. Wow!
5
The best red chilli crab in town. Whenever I visit I go to this place, good service, great food and nice location. I highly recommend it!
3
food is good but abit pricy. good for kids to scoot around. seafood is fresh. they gave free birthday buns with lotus paste if you let them know in advance yoy are celebrating birthdays. good service !
4
My first trip to the Red House was in 1983 and I have been back many times just for the Chilly Crab. Times have changed and so has the location of The Red House. The atmosphere isn't there any more but The Chilly Crab is still very good.If this is your first time you will love it but it used to be better
4
Great location! We got ourselves a great big round table with a lazy Suzanne and the food came out fast. Gigantic pepper and chilli crabs, cereal prawns, prawn fried rice and a really good beef fillet all washed down with draft Asahi.Food was good and definitely a worthwhile place to go for. Especially for a group of friends or relatives. Service prompt but does the jo
5
Every time that we have visitors, we take them to Red House to eat their famous Chilli Crab, Fried Rice and of course the beef with ginger! Beside the clam razors between many of the food menu that they have.Price is average to other seafood restaurants and do not forget to order the buns to dip in the chilli crab sauce!!!!
5
First time in Singapore with my wife on vacation. In search for a local lovely Crab we ve visited several special restaurants on Clarke Quay... This one looks to be the ONE and the BEST. Service : 5 from 5, cuisine : 5 from 5. We ve even decided to meet Xmass here.Recommended
5
I have heard about chili crab so I went to a Singaporean restaurant in Sydney. I wasn't impressed. Once I had a chance to visit Singapore, I did some research. And I have made my pick. Red House has blown me away with their food. The real chili crab deserves its name and fame, it was so delicious and spicy. The charcoal bun with chili crab filling (I know it's redundant but who's to stop me?) was outstanding. Everything I had there was throughly enjoyable except the peanuts small plate that they brought out at the start without ordering and charged you for it. I guessed that was the case before the bill arrived, but I saw no point in complaining, it might be different restaurant culture. The price overall is still reasonable anyway
5
This is an incredible local restaurant where you will eat by far the best Chilli Crab as well as their fried rice! As well the beef with ginger and spring onions was very good.Price is not cheap but the quality was really good. I will highly recommend to select the Shrilanka Chilli Crab as it is cheaper than the other one that will offer and the taste and product is better.They have a large selection of seafood from shrimp to anything you wish but their Chilli Crab is the best
1
the crab was not fresh and totally over priced. Did not like the chilli crab sauce.the egg tart and d mushroom dumplings taste bad, very dissappointed. Paid $160 for 2 person for a lunch and food was horrible. Only good thing is service
2
sorry bur bad athmospere, bad service and non fine dining, will not return to this restaurant in this time
5
Whenever I have chilli crab cravings, this is the place i would go. No over crowd and no hours of queue and crab tastes as good as other restaurant along clarke quay.
5
Had a wonderful meal at Red House Seafood Restaurant. Great fried rice, prawns, fish, Spicy Crab and wonderful tea.
5
We visited as part of a Princess Cruises excursion. We had a set menu but it was lovely to try a range of new foods that I would not have normally picked from a menu. Friendly service and hot food served in a banquet style buffet
5
This is always a trusty place to take out-of-town guests for chilli crab! It's got a great location along the river at Robertson Quay, and you can pop over to one of the other restaurants/bars for drinks after dinner. The chilli crab and food was really good
3
Went here for work and we managed to try quite a bit. The black pepper crabs were delightful. However found the sauce of the chili crabs a tad too watery for my liking and the mantao was served way before the crabs came out thus rendering them cold. The prawns were nice though would have been great if they were fresher.
5
Wanted to have a Singaporean seafood meal, but as always there was a long queue in front of Jumboâ€™s. Knowing that Jumbo is also hugely overprized, we went here instead. ...and was positively surprised! Friendly service, excellent food - and a more relaxed atmosphere than Jumbo, at least if you get one of the outside tables.
5
Red House is my go-to chilli crab restaurant in SG! Love their chilli crab and their drunken prawns are incredible!! You can also drink the broth/soup that comes with the drunken prawns. Delicious! Remember to order mantou (fried bread buns) with your chilli crab so you can dip the sauce! The crab is always a fun & messy affair!! Bibs are provided don't worry. Highly recommended
5
We had a lovely meal here. My wife had the beef fillet in black bean sauce and I had the daily special steamed fish, which was superb.The staff were extremely helpful and we were sorry not to be able to return as this was our last night in Singapore
2
Be wary that you Will be charged for Chinese tea and wet serviettes that you haven't requested but were 'given' anyway. Apart from that- great food, service and ambience.
4
Our go to restaurant to bring guests from overseas for Chilli crab. Their dishes are consistently good.
5
Had dinner here just after arriving in Singapore, a short walk from The Warehouse Hotel. The black pepper crab was excellent as was the lobster fried rice. Staff was good, the place was about half empty when we got there. The portions were a little hard to figure out, but the waitress correctly recommended the right dishes. Nothing fancy just good food at a good price
2
I first visited the Red House in the early 1990's, back then it was at the east coast seafood centre. The speciality is, of course, crab with my favourite being their chilli crab. Since then, whenever I have passed through Singapore (on average once a year) I have always visited the Red House for chilli crab. The service was good, the price reasonable (for crab) and the food excellent. This week I met a friend in Singapore and told her we would go to the Red House for a treat. I was very disappointed. Sure the crab was much the same as it had been but the service was abrupt to the point of rudeness and then at the end they tried to charge us for "pickles" which they brought, unasked for, to the table at the start and was not even touched by us and also two throw away towlettes that came with the crab and also unused. I felt disappointed and annoyed that this is what the place had become. I know there are other places for chilli crab in Singapore so, for me, it is time to ditch the Red House and try others
3
Ambience great Food to die for Service excellent If anything a bit on the expensive side. However saying that the small serves are a reasonably sized mealDownside. The bean dish they put on the table and was not asked for was a charged item. The wet towels on the table were a charged item. The same applied to the tea which was also placed on the table and not requested 66/10
4
Nice large restaurant everything appears to be done on a "production line" all the waiters had head microphones and head sets and everything produced in strict order. Had head waiter, wine waiter , food waiter and someone to take your orders. The food was of a good standard and I enjoyed my chilli crab. An enjoyable meal but not the best ambiance
5
Took a chance & having read other TA reviews & we were not disappointed. Delicious freshly cooked food served haphazardly and in no particular order - great fun. Good recommendations by the waitress who toned down our excesses !Best pak choi (with garlic) I have ever eaten
4
Not easy to locate restaurant at this location. But still, it has nicer ambiance than Robertson Quay's branch.Service was v good with both senior and junior staff attentive and courteous.Food was above average , Chilli crabs and white pepper crabs fresh and tasty. Duck was unique and nicely paired with crepes. No gamey taste at all. Even seafood soup and noodles were really delicious.A bit too pricey though, especially the crabs, otherwise would be 5 stars
3
party of five - ordered two Alaskan crab - one chili, one white peppered, steamed bamboo clams with garlic, drunken prawn, lobster pao fan. food comes in decent portion, fresh and tasty. but the bill is pricey for about $120 per pax. service is average, need to ask for attention given the restaurant was 15pct filled
5
It was my son's birthday so we went to the branch at Princep Street. I have been faithfully following the manager Sunny ever since they operated from the East Coast Seafood Centre. We decided to try something new apart from their excellent chilli crab. This time round we had a Scottish blue lobster fried with scallions and ginger. The grilled cod fish with teriyaki sauce is also a favourite of ours. We also had the seafood dry curry with fried buns. Really yummy. We also added on an additional order of steamed bamboo clams also from Scotland. They happen to have a promotional offer in July 4 for the price of 3. We also received complimentary desserts to celebrate my son's birthday. You can never go wrong here at Red House. So far still the best place for seafood in our opinion
4
Had a nice dinner at the Red House. Fresh seafood with seating on the terrace on Roberson Quay. Has black pepper crab which was very taste. Would definitely return.
5
We just love the bamboo clams and crab there. Personally we find the Kuei Fei crab is better than their chilli crab
4
Given corridor seat..hot n humid. Not v comfortable. Food wise - tasty chilli crabs, garlic clams, sambal kang kong n cereal prawns were all good.
5
Had dinner here on our last night in Singapore. Chilli crab was a dish that I have wanted to try for quite a while and was not disappointed. The sauce for the crab was divine and the crab was delicious and a lot of fun to eat. My husband had the black pepper beef and loved it. Not sure if I would do this again as it was quite expensive but great to try. Would work a treat if this was shared on a table of family or friends
4
Went here here around 4 pm with a friend, no problem getting a table and easy to find.We had one chili crab and one pepper crab, both ordered by the kg.For two persons we ordered one 1,2kg and one 1,3kg crab, it was enough, but not way too much.The crabs was really good and the staff were friendly and helpful at all time.The place itself is not very cozy, you don't have to dress up to eat here, but very clean.They also have aquariums where you can se all the live crab
1
Walking by the riverside hoping for a decent dinner. See this pretty crowded and buzzing place and decide to give it a go. Seating very soon but slow thereafter. Had to ask a couple of busy bees for service which finally came. Waited for around 25 minutes with food coming in bits and pieces. Soft shell crab had batter that was undercooked. Prawns were fresh out of a deep freezer and the rice didn't inspire much either. The wine was the only decent bit. S$108 for one person for one meal. And this is not even an air conditioned place. Not worth it at all.
4
A good variety of seafood available to choose from. The setting on Robertson Quay is far more tranquil than down at Clarke Quay. The service was good and the popularity of the restaurant is evident from the large number of people frequenting it.Well worth a visit
4
I had this craving for crabs & went to this place for dinner. had red Chilli crabs with buns & mixed seafood rice. The crabs were tasty & I made a right mess of myself eating them. But taste was good. Closes down at 10.30 so be ready to place your order by 10
4
This is a really busy place although we did get in one evening without a reservation. Like a lot of fish restaurants here it specialises in Chilli crab and other crab dishes. There are tables inside and out but it is all quite open. The menu is pretty much shellfish, crustaceans etc. The food is good and we had good friendly service. We shared dishes between us and had a good meal. You can ask for bibs as some of the food is to be eaten with the hands. Quite pricey but good
4
We had lobster and prawns at he Red House near Clarke Quay.They were both very good and cooked quite differently than I had experienced before.The prawn was done in their "custard " which was a delicious sauce and the lobster was cooked with a cheese grilled over top.My only regret was that neither were shelled and it was extremely messy to eat.They did however have a washroom at the front of the restaurant which was extremely welcome
5
Got the restaurant recommend from the Conrad hotel. Great food (I got the spicy seafood combination) and great location by the river. I will definitely come back. Price level was absolutely fair vs other sea food restaurant in Singapore.
3
Although the food we eventually ate was good, it all arrived at different times. The rice was cold by the time the chicken dish arrived. One person was finished and we were still waiting for other dishes. Expensive too.
4
I was at a conference in Singapore. The organizers took us to this restaurant. Very good Asian Seafood and very authentic. Meal presentation was quite stunning. Food was very tasty.
4
Red House Seafood Restuarant in Robertson Quay still maintained their good taste and quality. It's better to book as it's busy most time.
5
When in SG, one must try the Chili crabs. You may want to add some pepper crabs, as well. Really flavourful and great tasting. The Red house offers more that the crabs.Tips: if coming in a large group, better make a reservation. Also, better ask for the prices. Over-all, worth coming back for more.
4
It's a big restaurant so we felt neglected most of the evening because we couldn't find the staff in charge of our table to order extra things (like drinks or dessert) -or- to clear finished dishes from our table. Having said that, the food was good- chilli crab was excellent, the black pepper was also tasty (but noticeably much smaller than the chilli crab although charged the same kg), drunken prawns was awesome, etc
5
We choose this restaurant due to reviews on trip advisor and we weren't disappointed. Every dish we order was absolutely fantastic. I love seafood and my husband loves crab, I have never tried it and I did. I can highly recommend chilli crab. The Cantonese duck was awesome. Even the garlic broccoli was delicious. Kids ordered a 2nd portion. You must come to this restaurant
4
Went for dinner with another family, specifically for pepper crab. Didn't disappoint! Succulent and packed with flavour. Came with yummy little steamed buns. Rest of meal equally delicious- fried rice (yum), pepper beef (yum) an sweet sour prawns (huge crunchy juicy prawns!). All up, yummy yummy yummy. The started plate of prawn toast and fish cakes nothing special; didn't get eaten (mind you I've never been keen on them anyway). Good service , great venue for kids , bring skateboards and kids can roam around alone river bank while you eat and chat!
3
Expecting more than $$$$$ chili crab restaurant such as Red House. Chili crab sauce probably tomato base, i would expect something more than that. I didnt say it is not nice. The portion, serving, quality and taste was great. The other good that we ordered was tasty and presentable for family dinner The price at the grand finale was WOW We only ordered 2 chili crab thoughEventhough I have tried several others chili crab joint in singapore.  I still would recommend Red House to other people to tr
3
Red House is a reliable choice for introducing friends to the Singapore Chilli Crab experience.Their dish is a little on the sweeter side vs Jumbo's dish of the same name but it's a much more relaxed dining experience at Red House as Jumbo is always very busy
4
wide variety of crabs and the way you like it....very fresh...good service...We did wish we had been seated upstairs...a more 'upscale-looking' seating area....nonetheless, we enjoyed our spicy crab ...
3
Had dim sum and food was ok. Service was good. If you are in the area, can go check it out but no need to make a special trip down for this restaurant.
4
Always a good visit and they still have the best prawn dish with the custard cream prawns...flavor makes up for the small portions
4
Good food/chilli crabs and good service. Good environment too. It's slightly expensive to dine here though.
4
A trip to Singapore must include eating Singapore Chilli Crab. This is a great place to eat it. Robinson Quay is along the river and a happening area with a stack of restaurants to choose from. Red House specialises in seafood and their crab was delicious and sweet with a fabulous sauce. The other seafood was also good with freshly steamed big prawns and deliciously big scallops
4
Our last night in Singapore so we had to finish our week off with Singapore Chilli Crab and we were not disappointed with the offering from Red HouseGot a 1.3 kg Crab and it was beautiful Also had some Cantonese Chicken to accompany it with Would definitely recommend
4
We were a large group of 24 work colleagues and, as such, I had no great expectations of the service or food. In addition I'm shellfish allergic (as you can imagine this wasn't my choice of pace to eat!) I was pleased with the decor and how clean and bright it was compared to the other Red House I had visited. I was really surprised and delighted with both the service and the choice of food; the staff were happy to advise what I should avoid and were able to cook off menu if necessary. Clean, bright and fresh,
4
Went here specifically for Chilli Crab um...YUM. Order a few other dishes - whole fish, tofu - all very good quality. Service was average - not very friendly staff. As others have said - the crab is expensive - but its not something one normally has every day - so splurge a little 
2
I dont often hav such hard comments on a place, but this one takes the cake. After sitting down we were loaded witrh tea, washers and nibbles...not ordered. $ 13 for a local beer plus service charges and we had not placed a order!Food was average, seafood was ordinary and prices high! frankly this place is a complete rip off!If you elect to eat here, be aware what you are about.I do not recommend this restaurant
4
After coming and living in Singapore for 24 years, I still don't get sick of black pepper and chilli crabs from the Red House restaurant.Initially we always visited the restaurant at the east coast side and over the past 7 or 8 years we now frequent the Robertson Quay establishment.Normally we reserve a visit to when we have close friends or family visit us, as was the Occassion yesterday when my mate of 35 years arrived in Singapore and wanted to experience a great Singaporean meal.As usual we stuck with the tried and tested formula of salty fish fried rice, cereal prawns, Kangkoon vegetables and one black pepper and one chilli crab. As we had 6 people for lunch then finishing with mango pudding.An awesome meal, the Red House consistent to form and original tasty flavours and service We will be back again soon
4
Great location. Food portions are large. Service was quick however the staff didn't engage with the table. Not bad value for money. Would try again.
3
A must-try in Singapore that costs a looooooooooooooooooooot, nearly USD52 per person ordering crab, some simple veggies and meat dishes. The taste was not that inspiring, however, friendly services did make you feel you were important and that dinner was worthy until you checked your credit card bill.Well, not really my thing, won't come back
5
A simply outstanding Chinese seafood dining experience. Although centred around crab in various formats that should take nothing away from the razor clams, the prawns, the clams I could go on. Very child friendly. We were a party of 12 and there was room for kids to run around, very helpful staff and most importantly great food.They provided bibs, hand bowls and wipes for what is always a messy affair but boy was it worth itGo
5
On a afternoon where it was pouring with rain we stopped here for a quick meal. The restaurant was empty but being Easter Sunday may not have helped however we had the pick of the place!We ordered the chilli seafood and it was amazing! The Thai flavours, and creamy texture and the quality of the seafood was the best!Staff were amazing and friendly and couldn't do enough to help us! Take the time and drop in, it was really enjoyable
4
Not as busy as the seafood restaurants in Clark and Boat key, the Red House Seafood is a good alternative along the Singapore river. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. The menu is standard chili and pepper carb, fish, shrimps in many cooking styles. We tried the sweat and sour shrimps, black pepper beef and baby kalian. All were very tasty Service was o
4
Visited with friends as this was close to our hotel and looked interesting from reviews. We went for set menus which included clams, prawns, lobster and the chilli crab as well as dessert and a glass of wine each. Food was very tasty and service attentive. We had a laugh tackling the crab with our bibs and plastic gloves on! It was a good experience but worth £75 pp? Not really considering the seafood must come from these waters unlike the UK. Enjoyable but even for Singapore it was a bit pricey
4
Located right on the Singapore river. Our concierge suggested it over Jumbo Seafood.Started with a Crispy Seafood Roll, very Good contained calamari and shrimp. My wife ordered the pumpkin seafood soup, also very good.I had to order the house specialty, chili crab, enough for two and sold by weight. Not cheap at 83.60 Singapore dollars or about $ 67 US dollars. Definitely a must try dish in Singapore.My wife ordered the prawns in a custard sauce with heads on, very Asian. She thought they were very good
3
Staying near Robertson Quay (at the Grand Copethorne) we wandered past a number of local restaurants before going into Red House Seafood. Our choice was based on the fact that it looked busy (mostly Chinese) and seemed to have a good menu. Our needs were simple so we ordered the chilli crab for three people with morning glory with sambal and some Malacca prawns.Service was swift and the food fine, the Malacca prawns particularly good. All in all it is a fine option but it does not really have any particularly outstanding characteristics, fine if you are nearby but not worth a long journey to get there
4
At a relatively tranquil and scenic area of Robertson Quay, I am really pleased to notice such a popular & classic restaurant, Red House (being relocated from the East Coast area a few years ago) still served my all time favorites ; - the very delicious Fujian fried noodles, deep fried bun and Chili Crabs.The traditional atmosphere still exists, but blended with a more modernised & cheerful tourist moods. To me, it is more comfortable than the old venue, and offered more variety of dishes nowadays. Service is good, food all prepared freshly, so overall impression is great and worth to revisit again in my next travelling plan in Singapore.V L

We went to Red House for a meal of chilli crab after reading many reviews. We had half an alaskan crab which we were told weighed 1.7kg, two crayfish, four buns, two glasses of beer and a glass of water melon juice and the cost was $506 SGD which is approximately £290!! I new it was going to be expensive but apart from the ridiculous cost which we challenged, we were still hungry after it. Would welcome feedback
5
Good food
Amazing geoduck, chili crab razor clams service atmosphere attentive service
A must restaurant to go to
4
My husband visits this restaurant every time he is in Singapore and finally I got the chance! Food was fantastic, service was prompt and our waiter was funny and friendly - it was great to sit at a large round table with all our family.
4
Food was superb as always and the creamy custard prawns always hit the mark! But the service was really slow this time.
4
Very good seafood restaurant, proper portions, good value. Seems to be popular among Singaporeans, which is always a good sign. We ordered quite many dishes to share and were surprised how big the portions were. Nice atmosphere even though the renovation was still under progress.
4
The crab is excellent, but you pay for what you get.
It is like a virus, it will infect you, you will go back.
5
Tried the infamous Singaporean Chili Crab here at Red House. The restaurant is open air but with giant (GIANT) fans so it's really lovely. Our server told us that one crab would be enough for two and she was totally right. We got 4 buns, two steamed and two fried. The steamed were pure white, slightly sweet, and helped with the bit of kick of the crab. The fried ones were a bit denser and sweeter than the steamed. The crab itself was full of meat and the sauce was sticky, sweet, and a bit spicy. The vegetarian delight was absolutely delicious and I recommend getting it so you aren't just eating sticky sweet crab meat. It had a couple of veggies I didn't recognize along with asparagus, mushrooms, and onions. All were cooked perfectly and really fresh and flavorful. The little "pickles" they give you on the table are good although I am not sure if they are a bean or a peanut. We also got the mango juice which is thicker than western style juice and more like a puree. It was rich and smooth and really nice with the slight heat of the crab dish (and the weather). All in all the place was great and not terribly expensive for a nice dinner (we paid about $90 USD for the 1kg chili crab dish, vegetables, 2 drinks, and 4 buns). Definitely recommend
4
Red House is a staple for out of town guests coming into our Singapore office on business. They've all heard about Singapore Chilli Crab and Red House is where we take them. It's always loud and lively with very good, fast service and the food is excellent.But don't just settle on the Chilli Crab; the white or black pepper crabs are also exceptionally tasty and the white pepper brown (Scottish) crab is my favourite. So book in, get your bib on and prepare to get yours hands messy!!
4
We went to the Clarke Quay branch (couldn't find it on TripAdvisor) but we were impressed with the online reservation service, the quick seating, menu delivery and ordering. We had the whitebait to start. While tasty we asked for lemon as it was a bit dry without it. We had the lobster with cheese next - very well cooked but the cheese was a bit runny for our liking. We like it when the cheese is really brown and a bit crispy on top. The last dish we shared was the chilli crab. It didn't disappoint and we devoured the lot! We had two bottles of wine (which made the price a bit more expensive) but overall the pricing for good seafood was reasonable. We shall be back...maybe at another one of their restaurant locations in the city
4
This is a busy restaurant in the evening so getting a table and getting quick service is going to be a challenge. The menu is quite extensive so for the uninitiated, its going to be another challenge making choices. We could see that the portions are very big so you need a big appetite to finish both a starter and main course. We could not finish our seafood platter after having a starter even though the food was very good. The service is not that quick either for taking the order or for bringing the food - however you can see the chefs working in the kitchen from the table area and they are working hard to cope with all the orders.I found it a little expensive but that is maybe just Singapore prices
4
Had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to treat them to Chili Crab, Pepper Crab and the works - in a nice place with aircon and service.On arrival, was concerned to see no one in the restaurant on ground level and heading upstairs to find there was only one other group in the restaurant. Normally this is not a good sign!Anyway we sat down and had to wait and seek attention to place an order. Despite being on one of two groups in the restaurant, the staff were too focused on the other table. Quite disappointing and heightened the level of concern....Anyway, we finally got to ordering . . .and the food took a while to arrive so we needed to refill drinks/order more ... unfortunately it took over ten minutes to get any attention in a near-empty restaurant.Fortunately, and the saving grace, the food started arriving piping hot, well-presented, all at a similar time and it was delicious .... they're really doing this right and I will be back for this with my next guests!!!We ordered quite a bit as well for five people.... and have to say that the final bill was quite reasonable . (minor mistake on the bill was corrected quickly).So maybe because the branch is new the staff are still finding their feet, hopefully this will improve by my next visit.Thanks Red House
3
This place used to be one of my fav place for seafood ... however throughout the years, standards have dropped...
However, I am still going to recommend that you come and try this place.
4
An excellent recommandations for those who like spicy food especially pepper crabs ! Delicious and vey good location before going to Clarke quai !
5
I'm sure you can eat CHilli crab at a number of restaurants in Singapore but The Chilli crab and Lobster at this Restaurant is out of this world. The flavours are memorable and will leave you wanting more
4
In Singapore on business and had the obligatory chilli crab. It was good but I have had much better and considering the price expected more.
4
Knew we had to try this local specialty and so glad we did !! Pricey meal by our standards, but worth it . We also had Spinach Tofu and Scallops with Broccoli.....all good !! Our server was very patient with us and attentive, making dish suggestions. May want to make reservations

A typical "zi char" restaurant along the quay provides good ambiance. This is lesser known compared to the No Signboards and JUMBO's of Singapore but does the job with a big menu set alongside a mix of non-Chinese cuisines.Met with friends and had a mix of seafood, meat, and vegetables that filled us up. The sambal kangkong was good and so was the mixed seafood hotplate. Weirdest meal of the evening was the Uni Jap Chae (glass noodle) which was a newer dish we hadn't tried yet.There are better choices across Singapore but the ambiance around the area brings a mix of tourists and locals living around the area

Determined to have Singapore Crab we asked the Concierge to recommend a place close to the hotel - Red House was his recommendation.We found the place along the river and ordered the crab - prices depend on weight. Here the crabs were around $75/kg.The necessary implements were delivered plus a bib, finger bowls etc. But then you are on your own. A huge bowl arrives with crab pieces swimming in a sweet chilli sauce. It was a question of muddling through. End result was a huge mess, a lot of shell and a lot of sauce left. The one kilo size crab was enough for two but we hardly did justice to the sauce - way too much for us.So some tips: specify the weight of your crab otherwise the price can go anywhere; wear cheaper clothing, mess is part of the experience; be careful with your teeth, the shell is hard and chips end in the sauce, the rice and everywhere else.Its fun provided you are prepared for the hard slog of cracking the crab and searching for the small morsels of meat.Its not to everyone's taste

We read on the website that closed at 10:30 pm so we head in. when we got there around 9:40, the manager at the door didnt want to take us cos they were closed apparently.The restaurant was full of people and there were empty tablea.

Went to this restaurant based on the great TA reviews. Sat down, got served tea and realized they served shark fin soup. Got nausea and told the waiter I couldn't possibly patronize their restaurant when they served this dish (I'm an animal lover and the fact that they served this terrible, animal abusing dish made me ill) and to the restaurants defense he was surprisingly understanding (hopefully we where not the first ones with this reaction) and we left without further questioning.

Amazing crab...tried the Chili Crab and the Black Pepper Crab...neither disappoints. However, the service was abysmal. Staff that literally throw the menu at you when you arrive and speak to you in the most unwelcoming way.If you are willing to put up with sub-par quality of service but great food...then take a chance

using MRT --The young students or young exotic young man had leaded us changing point and departure of MRT,thanksfuly.

The creamy custard prawns always hit the spot and the cod fish teriyaki is highly recommended! Will be back!
4
Good restaurant for the famous chili crab...... and all the menu as far as that goes... fully recommend... only negative is the price a little high...
4
4 of us came w/o prior booking and still got a table in 5 minutes while the place was pretty full.
The food was fabulous, quckely served with good manners!

Recommended for its chili crab the crab was very good. We ordered two for four of us with some sides. The crabs were a tad pricey ($86 per crab). Go for the fried buns to dip in the spices sauce. Service was excellent. As in Portugal if there is a condiment on the table and you don't refuse it, you will be charged
4
Red House is a nice and lively restaurant located riverside in Robertson Quay. We visited them on the first day of 2017 (a holiday) and ordered red chili crab, cereal shrimp and seafood fried rice. All three were excellent. The red chili crab sauce is sweet and spicy, and when eaten with the chinese buns is just heavenly. I just wish that the fried rice had not come so soon after the crab as it got cold by the time we got to it.Service is OK. Since the restaurant gets quite busy, it can be challenging to get the staff's attention. However, once a request is made (say, for more napkins or another drink) they fulfill it quickly

I was really looking forward to eating here having read reviews about the great seafood but I have to say I was very disappointed. I ordered the BBQ prawns which stated in the menu a price of 10 dollars per piece. I asked for 4 and the waitress said 2 was enough so I went with that and ordered some fried rice as a side. The prawns were just ok, probably over cooked and not very flavoursome and if I had not ordered the rice I would have been very hungry! And when I reviewed the bill I was charged 15 dollars per prawn!Wine at 13 dollars a glass was expensive and the amount was less than a normal measure. My companion had the half duck which was very good so not everything was bad but overall I am very disappointed with my evening. There was no atmosphere and it was very quick in and out service. You are also provided with Chinese tea and some beans as a starter which are then added to the bill! Neither we ordered or wanted!I won't be back that's for sure!

We chose this restaurant as it always seemed popular when we passed it. This is a very big restaurant in Robertson Quay and it was very busy when we arrived. However, we received a very warm welcome and a decent table and green tea was delivered very quickly. After that, we struggled to place our order. Eventually we stopped a waiter who took our order and we managed to get a drink. There was a long delay for the food to arrive and somehow the main courses were brought to us before the starters which had obviously been forgotten. We pointed this out and received them just as we were finishing our main course. We noticed people on adjacent tables having similar problems. Despite this, we were kept happy by the staff who never stopped smiling and apologised very politely! The food that arrived was very good but one dish did not seem to be the same as the menu description and that wasn't explained to us. Overall the food was alright, the service was friendly but it was just very disorganised and too busy for the number of staff working
3
We made a booking through the hotel. The food was very nice and the service was reasonable and prompt. The worst part is charging for the peanuts and towels which we didn't order. Although the prices for food is reasonable you have to check the bill for "extras
2
With visitors in town, we wanted to find a place that served traditional Singapore chili crab. We looked this place up online and was told it was one of the best in the city, so we went. It was not what we expected... dreadful service (as if they were trying to be rude!), very loud and full of post-work locals and visiting workers in the neighborhood. Lots of local dishes but none of them healthy ( a lot of fried foods). The prices were shockingly expensive, so - after eating an appetizer - we decided to head somewhere else for our main course.I would not return to this restaurant again
5
Good food, good service and overall very nice decorations interior.
Reservation was easy too. Gave us a big round table for 16 pax.
4
We got taken out here by clients.
They ordered a variety of dishes from Squid and fish to crab
We found the food very good and this to be a pleasant experience.
4
Excellent chilli crab cold beer bottle of Australian wine was very expensive service good if you go there drink beer will go back when I am in Singapore again
4
Good authentic Singaporean seafood, with an atmosphere that takes you back to old singapore. Chop house location with great fans, fish tanks and good service. Great for visitors, business, set menu is good.
5
Fantastic food !! Excellent service. Make sure you go early since it is really busy. My favorite was shrimps with custard !!!! Try it. Is really delicious!!!
3
Terrible atmosphere (hot, loud, tables on top of another) combined with indifferent service make this location a big turnoff for me. Also, the big chains are much more expensive than going into an HDB and eating at a smaller, more local place.
4
Very good seafood, particularly the black pepper and chilli crab. Not the place for an intimate dinner but really good seafood options here. Great for a group of friends or work colleagues. You do feel the need for a shower after enjoying the wonderful crab. Walking distance to many hotels and surrounded by many other restaurants so you can have a different food option every day
3
Had a great dinner on a recent trip to Singapore. Walking Distance to the Four Points Sheraton where we stayed. This place is large with indoor and outdoor seating, but sorry, no air conditioning. They do have large fans inside that help, but it was hot when we were there and air conditioning would have been appreciated.We did one of the combo dinners for two. My wife wasn't feeling well, so I ended up eating most of her meal... and I was still hungry (not a lot of food). I was somewhat surprised that it was about 100.00 per person and I thought it to be steep for what you get
3
The most wonderful thing about this restaurant was its service. Nothing was too much trouble and the staff were lovely. The location was pretty nice also. The food, although quite nice, was very expensive for what it was. If the food was better, we would have gone back potentially but we wouldn't go back. I have chosen "fine dining" as the price was not mid range. This, by no means, reflects that the restaurant is a fine dining restaurant
3
We were in two minds Robertson or Clarke Quay. This restaurant was recommended to us by a local....we were told it had the best chili crab in Singapore. We found it to be busy due to it being Friday night. When the food arrived it was nothing to rave about. it is fine dining and expensive. We preferred going to the little local hawker style restaurants where the food was just as good if not better and a lot cheaper. The highlight was that it was beside the river and close to the stunning Kim Seng Bridge that we walked past to get to the restaurant
4
Very enjoyable location next to the river. Food was excellent, but service was somehow impersonal and careless, but this is a 100+ table place so you can't expect a personalized attention. Very nice dinner place nevertheless.
3
A nice quaint location, a spacious restaurant on the Quay but you have to make do sitting under the fan. So a bit uncomfortable on sultry days. My friends enjoyed the lobsters. Being a vegetarian, I found several options which were decently prepared.
5
The dinner was excellent, crabs, noodle, and grouper Hongkong style was the best I ever had and would order it again. The services was great and food was so good.
I would go back again if i have a chance
5
I love this restaurant, always buzzing so book ahead. A shared meal with colleagues, tasty, colourful generous portions. A reasonable price of 90 SGD including drinks, and a small price for such delicious food. My fave is the deshelled sweet n sour prawns, I love them. Try for a table outside where the lighting is not so bright. The queues outside are a testament to it's popularity. Give it a whirl
4
I don't live in Singapore, but got this place recommended from people who do. I must admit that it is a upmarket, but laid-back place where the locals come too.Crab - pepper and chili - was the best crab I had in a long time - and I don't even like crab that much. This was very good however. We also had lobster and prawns - all great. So this is a place where the locals come, though much of the shellfish is flown in from UK and the beer is Danish - however cooking is Singaporean.Definitely recommended
4
I was taken here for dinner by a Singaporean friend. The food and service was excellent . I understand the bill was a little over the top but that's because of the area it's situated. Would I visit again ? Maybe but not next week. Singapore is full of great places to eat and you can eat well at more reasonable prices
2
It is odd to complain about a restaurant that served us some tasty food but:1. The advertised promo that got us in became "lunch only" when we sat down2. Without asking we were served some beans and tea as soon as we sat down. We drank the tea but left the beans but were charged for them.3. My wife was sold another promo deal which turned out to be well above budget,4. The beers were twice as expensive as competitors nearby - "we haven't any local but you can have Carlsberg
2
We had a dinner with friends following a recommandation. We where very disappointing by the service then by the quality of food compared to price.The chilly crab was too sweet and tasted tomato. Really nothing authentic. The waiters come to add buns and other things we never ordered so we had to send them back...Really not a place I would go back in Singapore
3
The Restaurant was very nice....open and spacious. We ordered the Famous Pepper Crab and immediately was recommended an up-grade to a higher type of crab instead of the local variety. IT WAS A MISTAKE! The up-grade crab did not appear to be the same w222eight that was represented and the final bill was US $225+ with just the Crab and veggies, We were among 4 or 5 parties in this large venue......not a popular venue for those in the know! Oh yes, the meal was just average.....
2
We use TripAdvisor to visit new restaurants etc- generally it doesn't let us down. Red House is overrated. The surroundings are cheap and tacky. Food overpriced and lacking any class or taste. Staff rush out food together with no breaks, can't wait to take the money and get rid of you.Dreadfu
3
One of the signature restaurant for Singapore tourist.
My most favorite dish is Fried Rice. Not fancy Club or seafood dishes.
5
Magnificent
Out of this world
One of the greatest ever Chinese meals
If not the best
Sweet corn and crab meat soup
Sweet and sour prawn
Malacca prawns
Vegetable rice
Quality my friends
World class
Oh and a Ned Sauvignon Blanc
Im in heaven
5
If you like seafood, here is a place not to miss. Dishes that were very good, Spicy seafood combination, salted egg soft shell crab and Spinach tofu.
5
I had the sweetcorn & crabmeat soup & a seafood Fried Rice which were both extremely delicious.The table had a mosquito repellent wet wipe as well. The staff was very courteous. Ambience was really relaxing by the river
4
U can call to make the reservation to ensure ur seat. It's quite pax especially weekend or friday night. It's better than 'Jumbo' restaurant that has massive number of tourist and you have to reserve 2 weeks in advance. Chili crab is highly recommended dish!
5
Rarely do I eat chilli crab twice in a day - but in this case I am glad I did. I did Jumbo Seafood for lunch and Red House for dinner. Red House blows Jumbo right out of the water. The chilli crab is far more tasty at Red House, firm nice juicy crab, the sauce not to sweet with a tad of spiciness. The service miles better, a real delight. Sorry Jumbo found a new place for Crab
3
Fantastic seafood selection, however other traditional Asian alternatives were also available. We had beef and oyster sauce, duck pancakes and rice as well as a starter of the trio of squid, but it was far too much for two! The Waiter did warn us about ordering two starters so we opted for one but it was all still too much! Delicious though and good servic
4
Reviews of this restaurant are mixed and most are very accurate for their own reasons. Red House is good but not cheap. It's is in the popular and more affluent area called Robertson Quay. Tourist and Ex-pat central. Not a lot of Singaporeans call this area home therefore the restaurants increase the prices. The food is very good. Red House have a good range of Chinese / South East Asian cuisine and many of the typical dishes that the western tourist trade seeks out. It's worth noting that in Singapore you can pretty much get the same great meal for half the price but many won't like the district or the environment. They are very local but generally fine. Chinese mannerism can appear quite abrupt to those not used to it. If you want a warm and loving experience from your server then stay at home. However, it can be part of the experience so I recommend you don't pass on any Asian restaurant based on typical service feedback. Friday and Saturday is crazy busy. If you don't like crowds or waiting for a table pick another day. If you like good seafood (especially the expensive but enjoyable Sing Chili Crab) and a great atmosphere by the river then Red House is a great place to visit.
5
This was recommended by a friend.It is expensive. The chili crab was excellent.Sally our waitress was excellent .They are a it slow in getting the order out.As it gets later they will sometimes run out of items but not often.The outside dining along the river was nice.The soup appetizer was excellent and the 3 of us shared the large pot.The prisons were very large and grilled to perfection. The chili sauce was really excellent .The crab was excellent as well
5
I had the pleasure of enjoying dinner at the Red House with eleven business colleagues from all over the Asia Pacific region. Our host orchestrated a ten course extravaganza that I will remember for a long time. We were at the Riverside location at Robertson Quay, a large open building with great views of the river and large fans to move around the hot, humid air. It is best to have a local order for you but the staff are friendly, speak good English and are eager to recommend dishes. There are lots of beer choices but don't expect a large wine list. We had a variety of local and Chinese dishes, all cooked to perfection. Get the Octopus 3 Ways if it is on the menu. We had large shrimp cooked in a sweet sauce that was excellent. The veggies were all fresh and tasty. But you go for the crab-- and you will not be disappointed. We splurged and had it two ways: simply steamed and the signature chili crab. Both are marvelous. The crabs are large with lots of sweet, tender meat. You don't have to work hard for your dinner like you do with Hairy crabs. The steamed dish showcases the sweet freshness and the chili version adds the Singapore sizzle. Wear the bib, dive in with your hands and use the tools provided. The sweet Chinese deserts are a perfect counterpoint. This is Singapore so nothing is cheap: that said, you get a feast here for the price of a normal meal.
2
Very expensive and not good resturant,crew no able ti assist guest we where there in 18 Ago and they didn't advise us about price,for only one plate we payed abitanti 80 dollar for each one
1
Had been asked to wait for 15mins, 5mins and another 15min before getting a table. Commitment to customers are rubbery. This is followed by another wait for order and servings another 30mins for first delivery of dishes. The waiters are not responsive and impolite.
4
The food is good and the place is ok but there is something missing,
It was the first restaurant we tried in Singapore because it was not far from our hotel, the location is very nice.
4
the restaurant serve mainly cantonese style chinese food. i went with my wife who loves eating chilli crab and we find red house most suited to our taste. At least it is better than the popular crab restaurant that chopped up the crab in advance to save time. we also ordered a clam, a stir fry vegetable and a fried rice and find their standard up to par. one regret is they don't have good house red wine
4
I was not able to book a table at a Seafood Restaurant for a oversee guess at Clerk Quay. Did some research and managed to find this alternative seafood restaurant at the less noisy area along the Singapore River.We had the Chilli Crab, Tofu, Steam Fish, Desert and a Bottle of Wine. The food was good but not fantastic. The cost of the meal for 2 ended up at about $250.00. Its on the high side
3
Was craving for Chilicrab before we flew out of Singapore, but due to timing of flight, Jumbo seafood had not open for evening dinner yet. Red House had. They could have just as well been closed. there were only one other table with guests when we arrived. The waiter gave us the menu and took our orders. After some waiting, our food came. Nothing wrong with the chili crab - jummy. Did not get enough buns, so wanted to order more...but where to find any one to refill both buns and drinks? The waiters did not pay attention to our table what-so-ever. We managed to get contact with one of those that looked like they were off shift, however did not help much. At the end I was so tired of waiting, I went to the kitchen myself... The Teriyaki Cod was expensive and not to our taste. I know the timing was not good for our visit, but the restaurant should probably been closed - like most of the other restaurants are at that time of the day
4
I heard about Jumbo being the best seafood restaurants, but I wanted a place that has decent seafood around Clarke quay that don't rush me at peak hour. This was recommended by my hotel concierge and we had a great meal the first time with sesame fried lobster, cereal prawn, that we returned the second time to try their chili crab. Cereal prawn was excellent, and lobster and crab were decent. Their seafood fried rice was terrible tho. We tried crab with noodle soup, and scallop with veggie which were good too. Overall, food is decent. Couple servers were abrupt and tried to fool us that all the seats inside the restaurants were reserved even though the restaurant was more than half empty. Other than that, most servers were attentive and nice, and service was quick and we were not rushed. Also, I prefer this area (Robertson Quay), compare to where Jumbo is (Clarke quay and other places), so overall I recommend this place
4
We went for the 2 person set menu. Advertised as $88 per person. Keep an eye out for prices with ++ at the end. Ended up being $216 for the 2 of us. In saying that. Great service. Delicious food. Wear the bib they provide and try and bring your own serviettes and/or wet wipes.
5
worth a try ! there is so many dim sum places in Singapore, I like this place as the dim sum skin is thin and all dishes are flavourful. Price is ok for the quality. service is quite fast. Seafood is fresh and finger licking good !
4
The location is great, right by the Singapore River but get ready for a queue if you didn't book your table ahead of time. They are packed even on weekdays. Due to the large amount of customers I find that the service is very slow compared to Jumbo and even Long Beach operating at the same capacity. Naturally the main thing to order would be the crabs. Either Chili or Pepper would be their 'famous' dishes. They always seem to run out of Sri Lanka Mud Crabs and end up pushing you Scottish or the Alaskan Crabs which are more expensive. Taste is above average, but I still prefer Long Beach as I find the Pepper Crab too peppery. But nevertheless, give it a try if you are already in the area as the location has other hangout places which is great for after dinner chilling out and beers
5
Fabulous restaurant. Very busy. Great food. Helpful and friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Overlooking Singapore river. Great area.
4
Crowded even on weekdays so reservation is recommended. Food is being served fast and quality maintained
4
Redhouse is the place to go for Red Crab Curry!
Amazing food, Great Service!
They also have a depth of items in the menu that complement the crab.
4
Very popular local seafood restaurant. Crab was enormous and well cooked as were the other dishes. Relaxed but busy atmosphere
3
Great seafood, good service. Authentic Asian seafood cuisine in a beautiful spot along the Singapore River.
3
This place was extremely overpriced and over rated. Server wanted to get you in the door and food ordered and then never saw you again. Would not return.
4
Great dinner here on a recent stopover. Situated on the river in Robertson Quay, the relaxed atmosphere was nice. Had the Pepper and Chilli crab, and a variety of smaller dishes amongst our group, and food was excellent. Service was quick and friendly. Price mid range
5
We stayed at Clarke Quay and try to book a table at Jumbo Seafood.However, Jumbo seems to be always full and a friend suggested Red House.It was a pleasant surprise.We had both chili and pepper crabs and they were excellent.The ambiance was nice as well.I've been to Jumbo and No Sign Board before and Red House ranks similar or even higher
4
The location (Robertson Quay) is perfectly relaxing, and the food is classic Singaporean. I don't remember everything that I ate, but I know I had the chili crab, a Singapore classic. I loved it. What a mess but absolutely spicy and delicious. Service was fine; we had a wonderful table on the sidewalk near the river --- felt like a vacation (I was there on business). You must be up for a little bit of a mess, but this and chicken rice must be on your must-eat list before you leave Singapore. The Red House is a great way to check the box on the chile crab
4
Great staff, fun nite out & busy old school Chinese casual diner worth the taxi fare & the visit..Poms were playing Wales in footy @ the sports bar next door & was pumping to add to the atmosphere. Would return if in Singapore was recommended by a local foodie & did not disappoint..You must try the seafood Chili as a starters don't over order & have to walk home like us : ) Reasonable bill & good cold bee
4
Excellent service staff.
Enjoyed the chilli crab and salted egg crab. One of better ones. Recommend Make a reservation via Chope and can buy vouchers with 10% discount. Crowded and noisy, hard to hear each other over the din.
5
Excellent food in a fun area in Roberson Quay. Better to sit outside , as the inside is a little like a cafeteria.Either way , the best seafood I had in Singapore.
5
We had a great dinner at the Red House Seafood Restaurant. The wasabi prawns and the sweet and sour fish were really excellent. I would fully recommend it!
3
Good quality seafood, average setting, bit expensive. Basically what you would expect from a popular tourist spot, tourist targeted cuisine and menu selection.
Private room is air conditioned, but you get no atmosphere in there.
1
We decided to “follow the locals” at Robertsons Quay and ate at the busiest restaurant, Red House, not knowing it was a chain in the city. Initially it looked good. Pickled peanuts and tea came to the table without asking while we considered the menu. We assumed these were complimentary as we had not asked for them, and tucked in complementing such a honourable custom. Little did we know they would appear on the bill. Not the done thing at all. We chose the Pomfret, which for southern Aussies is a Sweep, a very sweet fish often caught by rock fisherman. Very popular in Singapore, the market price varies widely due to time of year. However in June I would have expected a more modest price than we were charged. We also ordered the garlic broccoli. When it came it was Italian broccoli, not the Chinese broccoli that we were looking forward to and expecting, and quite bland and disappointing as well . The less said about the deep fried squid the better, as they were just inedible. The bill left me cold due to charges for items not ordered. Expensive and poor quality, there are many better places on Robertsons Quay. Avoid Red House
4
 Most tables taken when four of us dined on a Tuesday evening at about 7:30 and a good mix of people. A good sign we thought and we were not disappointed. Excellent mixed seafood dish with a nice balance of chilli. Lovely fried buns, a very moreish fried green vegetable dish and an excellent steamed whole flat fish served in a coriander flavoured broth. With rice of course and all very satisfied. Would come back again
4
We are great fans of Pepper and Chilli Crabs so were very happy to have an option for this closer to CBD where we were staying. The staff, kindly and with good humour, accommodated our fussy 9 year old who was not such a fan with a very nice chicken dish. All the food was excellent but I would still rate the Long Beach crabs on the East Coast as even better especially the chilli crab
5
This is a must when you go to Singapore! Chili crab is phenomenal, and the little buns you get with it are divine. The vegetables, baby kailan and others, excellent. Inside the atmosphere is almost like a canteen so I prefer sitting outside with the beautiful scenery of the Singapore skyline in the background. Absolutely an amazing experience
5
Every visitor to Singapore must sample the crab before departing. We chose Red House based upon some reviews and were delighed with the choice. We had both Chili Crab and Black Pepper crab and they were outstanding, although I view the Chili crab as the must-have dish. The other revelation was the shelled prawns with crispy cereal coating. The prawns were fresh and amazing tasty, we were licking the plate after polishing them off in record time. It was very busy, but the service was quite good, the beer was cold and so all was good. Wash yourself off at the large sink after gettingcovered with chili sauce and you've had a true South Asia experience
4
Situated on the quay in a pretty waterfront area, this restaurant caters for locals, ex pats and tourists alike.The menu was so long and comprehensive that we didn't know what to order and opted for the banquet dinner for 2. It was fantastic and a great way to sample a variety of seafood - chili crab (of course), razor clams, prawns and lobster with noodles. A taste sensation. It wasn't cheap - it worked out to be about AUS $100 per head (including a glass of wine) but excellent food. Highly recommend this restaurant and was glad to see so many local family groups there, rather than the place being filled with tourists
5
Red House is situated near Singapore river. Beautiful view, excellent chili crab and crayfish. About 150 S$ for two person(except alcohol). Small size is enough for two person. Service is quite good and fast. We are going to return here for sure!!
5
Each time that I go to Singapore I have to eat in this marvelous restaurant... A little bit expensive but does not matter I love it... Incredible food, very good service, a new way to discover the seafood..
4
Returned to Red House after a couple of years away. All the food is pretty good here and the Chilli crab was excellent. Considering the location, a good value restaurant and service is attentive.
5
Yum, yum ,yum -What more can I say -food here is absolutely delicious.
My partner and I has Chilli Crab and Mee Goreng.
The crab although pricey was possibly the best Ive had in Singapore as was tyhe Mee Goreng.
Definitely worth finding !!!
5
Went here on a business dinner and was not disappointed, scallop, clams, huge black pepper crabs, sweet dough, prawn, mee goreng. Fresh, authentic, large portions. Absolutely superb!
5
Great menu, taste of real Asian kitchen. Best sea food but also high quality meats. If you are coming with a group of friends take set menu. Couples will not be also disapointed coming here for special occasions

We had friends visiting us from Sydney and wanted to take them to an authentic Singaporean restaurant to sample the great seafood on offer. Having undertaken some serious online research, Red House Seafood looked like it ticked all the boxes.So Friday last we started off at the Supertree bar at Gardens by the Bay and then made our way up by taxi to Robertson Quay. The restaurant was full to overflowing when we arrived and despite having booked online the previous Sunday, there wasn't a table for us. My wife's persuasive approach bore fruit and within 20 minutes we were sitting at the first available table looking at the menu. We decided on the option for a banquet for a group of four. What was delivered was mouth watering, succulent seafood in a range of different sauces, all of which were delicious. To start with we enjoyed a scrumptious serve of Asparagus Spears sautÃ©ed in XO Sauce. This was followed by Steamed Scottish Razor Clams with Minced Garlic, BBQ King Prawns with Melted Butter, then Crabs in Red House Special Chilli Stew with Fried Mantou and finally (seafood wise), a lovely lobster noodle dish finished off with a mango sorbet/dessert. We each received a glass of red or white wine as part of the banquet which was a nice touch (we all selected white) and the waitress serving us did a great job timing the delivery of each dish as we finished the previous one. Another nice touch, we were provided little bread rolls to mop up what remainded of the Chilli Stew sauce which was absolutely beautiful.So despite the delay in being seated, we all enjoyed a wonderful meal in an authentic Singaporean restaurant, exactly what we had been hoping for. A tip for any future visits, plan to arrive around 7 pm or 8.30 pm, by 8.45 pm there were free tables and I'm sure we would have been seated. If you book online, give the restaurant a call a day or so before just to make sure they have the booking
5
Red House is an institution in Singapore, because it does best what is a worldwide renowned and a distinctly luxury local dish, the Singaporean Chilli Crab. We wanted to try it for real, and we were delighted with our experience here. The service is super efficient and sharp. Everything we wanted, delivered. The atmosphere gives all the charming old world Chinese-Singapore feel, especially with the quayside, relaxed pace setting. And the food, the food is cooked perfectly and tasted fresh. We had the barbecued fresh shrimp, the (huge) succulent chilli crab and garlic broccoli ... it was superb
3
High quality of the sea food at this restaurant. Excellent taste but very difficult to eat the shell fish as crab as the very expensive loobster. The shell was not crushed and there where only chopsticks to eat with. This made it more or less impossible to eat all the fish meat.It was also very messy due to lots of good sauce was pored over the shellfish.It was a very noisy restaurant nothing to enjoy when smallchatting.It's a mass restaurant where volyme counts of people
2
Although the restaurant came highly recommend, my partner and I were left a little disappointed. We had the $88 banquet hoping to experience a little bit of everything. The Razor clams and Asparagus where great but the Chilli Crab and Lobster tasted as if they were old or thawed. We had the Chilli Crab at Long Beach East Coast a few days ago and it was a 1000 times better. Just saying.
4
Came here last Friday after reading reviews on Singapore chilli crab, lots of favours and very fresh crab but be sure to check price and weight other seafood offers are of good standard.

Walked in the place was very busy and exciting, had a share plate plus some over priced crayfish (like anywhere in the world) service was good and not a bad dinner
4
If you d0nt mind paying for it this is one of the best at the quays. Tried it 20 years ago and still great.

The Red Dot bar & Seafood restaurant has very good seating arrangement on the quay side.We went during the St.Patrick's Day celebrations. We were told that they serve green coloured beer which we did order. It looked kind of cute, though it tasted just like a normal beer

First time in Singapore so had to try chili crab. This restaurant is right on the river in Robertson Quay. Good was very good. Chili crab sauce is pretty delicious, a little sweet with a kick. Very messy to eat though so be prepared with a bib and gloves. We also had tofu with spinach, cereal crusted shrimp, cod. All was tasty. Service was ok not great but to be expected In place that turns tables as fast as they do. Overall a great first food experience in Singapor

I have visited this restaurant every time I have been to Singapore, hell, I'd even fly from Australia to Singapore just to go to this restaurant!Why? Because the seafood combination curry is just that good. If it were my last day on earth and someone were to ask me what my last meal should be, I would pick that curry. I've eaten some of the other dishes, including the chilli crab, and they were also very good, but it is that curry that I dream of when I contemplate yet another trip to Singapore. So, stop reading these reviews and start planning how you can get yourself to this restaurant to eat this curry. It is THAT good

Like many others we had been told to try the chilli crab in Singapore and our son (a student at NSU) guided us to this restaurant.Helpful staff, not too busy (although it was late afternoon) and pleasant surroundings.There are three types of crab that they usually have on offer, Alaskan, Sri Lankan & Scottish (dependant on season). Some are larger than others, both in size and in weight so either do your research before hand as to what you want or discuss with the staff what suits. We, ironically, being three English folk, ended up eating a Scottish crab, in a restaurant in Singapore, poor blighter. We are not avid seafood eaters but found the crab and the chilli stew/sauce delicious, highly recommend a handful of the bread dumplings as well.Prepare to get very messy, as having to extract your own meaty morsels from the crustacean can be a battle.Give it a go, but do your homework first
4
We went to this restaurant with my cousins from England. The restaurant was very busy but we had no trouble getting a table. Seafood is not my favourite meal but everything I tried was very nice. My cousins ordered a few different dishes and we all shared. The deep fried sweet and sour fish was my favourite but I believe the garlic scallops were delicious. The cost of the meal was, to me, very overpriced.
5
Booked on line and got a response which was great.Been here before and the quality of the food takes some beating, a bit expensive mind but a very extensive Chinese menu which gives you three different sizes when you chose your dishes, S - for 1/2, M for 3/4, L for 5 plus. Service is very quick but they are not throwing it at you and if you need to order more you will not be kept long.Beer comes in bottles or jugs, shame they do not do Tiger on draft seeing as how it is brewed there.If two of you have an appetite and a thirst then 200 SD (about Â£100 quid) is what you are looking at, not cheap. But then again, order less expensive options.BEWARE - service charge is include

I read in Singapore you must try the famous Chili Crab and we choose the Redhouse Seafood(@ Prinsep str). In early February the 1 kg crab was 76 S$. Be sure to ask before order and ask for a specific size. The tea, wet napkins, nuts, everything is surcharged, don't be surprised! This is the custom here. If you don't need it, just say it and staff will take those away. Also, you're gonna need the napkins after the crab and those were only 0.60 S$ each.We ordered the Custard Prawns and the Chili Crab with those little fried buns. The prawns arrived soon and were really delicious! We had to wait a little bit for the main course as we were told. When arrived we were provided with the necessary tools to eat it. My experience is a little bit mixed. The meal itself is really fantastic, the sauce is absolutely tasty, the crab meat is soft and good. But to get out that little stuff is very tedious and you are charged for a whole crab but there is very little meat in reality. I wouldn't say don't try it, because it's fun and Singaporean but don't get too hyped about it (like me). It's a tasty but messy meal with less meat

Been there on the occasion of Lunar New Year. Was recommended the traddional dish of celebrating new year. It was fun!
The seafood was great, esp. the chilli crab.
Dishes of veggie were tasty as well.
3
Lovely food in a wonderful setting right next to the river. My husband and I went to eat there and ordered the crispy squid and sweet corn and crab soup. We ordered small portions of each but soup could have fed four or even six easily. We struggled and managed five bowls between us and there was still more! We then went for the duck, beef with ginger and spring onions and special rice but could not do this justice after the soup. Staff very friendly and helpful thoug
5
About once a year I feel the need for the famous Singapore Chilli Crab and there is no better place than Red House on Robertsons Quay.Whilst there are other places Red House is known for quality without the price tag of Clarke Quay. Forget the others and walk here... In fact walk up the river first and then get prepared for a lazy feast.Market rates will dictate price but a small 1kg crab was $72. Special fried rice $16
4
We had two small chili crabs and one lobster and two scallops. Every dish was amazing and especially chili crab and lobster were really tasty. Chili crab in here has a tomato sauce and if you can't eat spicy, plz don't worry. I can't eat spicy at all but I was able to enjoy the dish. Plus you should order flied bread. Strongly recommend to go

After consideration seeing good reviews online we choose the Red House Seefood restaurant for our lovely dinner. We asked our Marina Bay Sands concierge to reserve a table and arrived there on December evening looking forward delicious Seefood experience.Well, unfortunately we got a nasty surprise from the very beginning.The restaurant doesn't look nothing like on their website pictures, it feels more like a cheap Chinese street food bar in Chinatown with plastic chairs. The first thing which caught my eye in the menu was a Shark Fin soup. I couldn't believe how they can offer such a cruel dish. At that point we should have left but we were hungry enough so decided to stay.Staff struggles to communicate with some basic English. We ordered a glass of wine, a beer, crispy duck with pancakes for the start followed by stir fry Seefood noodles and Thai fish with egg fried rice. The waitress spent at least 5 minutes trying to explain that whole fish weights more than 1 kilo and will be expensive. Never mentioned about how hot the dish is. 10 minutes later the waiter arrive with: egg fried rice as a first course. For my remark, that we order duck as a starter he quite rude answered that in Singapore they serve food different way and we "Western people" should get used to it. 5 minutes later he brought all courses alltogether. Unfortunately the Thai style fish was so spicy that was uneatable. Although I love spicy food and never struggled with spices even in Thailand that fish was covered in mouth burning red sauce. We spoke to the manager, he apologised and took the fish back to the kitchen however still charged us for whole meal including service charge!!! 360 SGD for the lack of atmosphere, dreadful food and rude service!We left in disgust feeling totally cheated on.Meal: 0/10Atmosphere:1/10Service:0/10Price value:0/1

The food at the Red House is outstanding. Of particular note is the red chili crab. The breaded shrimp and whole fish is also excellent. The service is average and not all the food came out at once. I would certainly go back but this could be a five star review if the service was improved.
4
We were recommended this restaurant by the hotel as a true taste of Singapore and it did not disappoint. We had a table outside facing the quay and were served promptly, professionally and accurately. The Chilli Crab was excellent although, as usual, this is a messy dish and not to be attacked in your best outfits! But we were provided with bibs and they were necessary - or maybe that was just us.I would definitely recommend this restaurant to visitors to Singapore (there were a lot of locals eating there which is always a good sign
3
This seafood restaurant at Robertson Quay serves excellent dishes such as seafood platter (good choice to start as appetizers), Wasabi prawns, stir fried beef and belachan Kang Kong vegetables! However the crab dishes did not impress too much, though the black pepper version is better than the Chili crabs. Do choose also the Sri Lankan crabs over the British mud crabs, personally find it more tasty. The place is very crowded in the evenings with many tourists, reservations is definitely needed.
4
Had to take my good lady for crab while in town and Red House is always a solid choice, we went early arriving not long after the 3pm opening, service was very slow with staff seemingly focusing more on prep for the busy period later than the few early customers.food was good, the crab excellent
4
Recommended and booked by the Shangrila Hotel. The Sri Lankan Black Pepper crab was delicious, perhaps a little messy to eat. They do provide bibs though so you don't wreck your clothes. Very fresh ingredients. Good spot to be on Robertson a quay which is a hive of activity with the locals
4
It's hard to find a good Chinese in Australia, sooo, it seems we've had to come to Singapore to find one? Authentic, fresh ingredients, you'll eat till you're full!
On the river, and full of local Chinese! That's always a good sign.
4
The food is great if your looking for sea food and fish, look's like local place, prices are averaged, service is great, you can share the food by place it in the middle with turning table.
5
An excellent chilli seafood combo & an amazing crispy half duck with pancakes. Already planning to come again on our next visit to Singapore.
5
Wife and I visited the other night and were certainly not disappointed . Enjoyed the chefs special , squid 3 x ways . I enjoyed a king prawn sweet and sour and the wife had the Sri Lankan chilli crab . both dishes were d'lish !Prompt service and great food. You pay for good seafood, worth every cent 
4
Lovely, breezy atmosphere to dine at. Quality of the dishes was good enough that even though the gigantic fans did cool the food down quite quickly, we still enjoyed the flavour, freshness and cooking techniques. But we'd take a breezy dining atmosphere over dining in heat any time. Service was a little lacking during peak period, but once the servers were made aware that we had asked for our white rice twice already, we noticed a marked improvement in the level of attention the servers were giving us. Will return again.
4
We used this restaurant for our first night as we are new to the town. We had a set menu which, in itself, would have been OK. But the additions to the bill were a bit offensive. The staff were attentive and brought the dishes on the menu in quick succession; they also brought serviettes, rolls and jasmine tea without being requested. We accepted these as part of the good service but, of course, good service has to be paid for and these items were added to the bill. There was already a service charge on the bill so no tip was necessary. I have to say the food was nice, the service was excellent but I felt a bit cheated by the bottom line
4
Our first visit to Red house this year. We usually eat here when we have guests or family members visiting. We love the overall ambience as well as location. Love the fact that after dinner, we can stroll along the river walk or crossover the alkaff bridge. The food is quite good, amongst our orders (Chilli crab, fried mantou, sweet sour fish, sweet sour prawns, salted egg yolk prawns, fried chicken and samba kangkong), the salted egg yolk tasted rather bland... and the chicken was rather tough too. Other than that, the rest are good, and the sambal kangkong is fantastic! Portions are rather small, so please ask how many prawns in a small/medium portion. If you are booking from chope.com I do suggest buy their vouchers in advance!
1
Worst meal I've had in a long time. We really wanted to try the chilli crab, seeing as everyone goes on about it in Singapore. We paid a small fortune and hardly got any crab off the thing. We were clearly beginners, we had no help from staff, we even had to ask for a claw crusher thing and they which they'd automatically bought out for a Chinese couple next to us! Avoid! Overpriced and felt like a rip off. Much nicer places along the river
4
I've been to this restaurant several times. Every time I have visitors I take them to this restaurant. Food is outstanding. I usually order Chill Crab ask for the cheapest smallest one which is usually big enough to serve 4 people. The Chinese bread thing taste great as well, perfect with the chill crab. Oh and don't forget to order fried rice, again, great with the chill crab sauce.
4
The main restaurant on our i ternary visit our special Red House for Pepper CrabSo we booked with Sunny our old supervisor server an also waiter/ friend of 2 decades 2 large Crabs ! O wow when we first used to visit red house on east coast road it was $ 23 per kg! The 28 then 38 and now 68 but still we liked it Sunny was off on Christmas Day but Louis took care of us the pepper crabs as always were great the sea food roll good and the noodles and speciL fried bread nice too but the size of the bread was reduced to half!! Sunny this is not good get back to the normal sizeWe enjoyed our mealThank
5
Been here a couple of times traditional Singapore food , efficient , tasty and a institution that never disappoints
4
Great local flavours. Crowded restaurant and not a tourist trap like those you might find around Clark's Quay
4
This an extremely good restaurant for sea food,.It is more authentic in taste than the popular brands in Singapore. Great service, very helpful staff.... the experience was very memorable. Went twice there during our 5 day stay .. is walking distance from Roberston walk.Chill crab is not Chill hot.its tast
5
we Sat in the arcade seating, they offered great assistance in ordering the chili crab (we ordered mild chili) and Vietnamese fried prawns. It took a little time on a busy night. they offered wet napkins, and hot tea. the food was great. It was our first time to eat a single crab that weights around a kilo and half
4
The service was very good with the staff giving me good explanations, guidance and portion recommendations. Had the small portion of their house specialty Spicy Seafood Combination and recommend this for taste and content. Far exceeded the usual "find the seafood bits" that you get at most other places.If your a big eater you may need to consider a larger portion which is available
3
The red roof restaurants serve good seafood at many locations, and we have enjoyed many a good meal there. This time the service was uninterested and the food rather mediocre. That is also reflected in the fact that the restaurant seems to have had to shrink a bit in the last year.Robertson Quay needs a good seafood restaurant, so hopefully they shall make a good comeback
5
I must say that because it is very very awesome. the sauce sounds good and the see-crabs are very pleasant to taste. its taste is a bit sour of tomato and spicy of pepper flutes. Eat with fried dumplings soaking in the spicy sauce. i think i will never forget that taste and if i have a chance to come back, i will visit this place again. promise
4
Went to this restaurant to try the chilli crab - though it was good, it did not quite live up to my expectations. That said, the black pepper crab was divine! The service is basic and can take a while if you go there during the dinner rush hour (which was when we went there). Nevertheless, we sat outside and enjoyed the view
1
Horrible Service. Rushed and rude.Food overpriced and not that great. No napkins on tables.. but i guess this is the norm in Singapore. Waiters had no idea what was on the menu.Very disappointed... was recommended this place by friends. I will never listen to these friends again
3
I camehere with two others and we wanted to have local seafood dishes known to Singapore. We started off with the geo duck appetizer. Now I know the menu stated local market pricing, so my issue isn't the price, we ordered a half order to try for the very first time. And it cost about $108. It is 100% an acquired taste. Let's just say I wouldn't eat it again. The Chili crab is delicious. The sauce is unbelievably tasty. Would for sure recommend this dish. We also ordered seafood noodles which was also tasty. The thing I didn't like was the billing at the end. If kind of soured our mouths as we left. They charged us $1 for the pickled peanuts which they don't even ask if you want. None of us had any. They also charge you for wet naps. Which we did use. However,if presented the option. The washroom was right next to us. So while they have some delicious and expensive food. I feel like getting charged a few dollars here and there for things you don't ask for is ridiculous.
3
Had the lobster which was good, however my husbands food arrived well after my own food. The staff try hard, and will do anything to help, but the cost off the food is extortionate for the quality.
4
We visited this restaurant with some friends. Overall great experience, loved the insane plate of crab, the house specialty. Taste was very good, wine as well.
3
Food was good, tasty and fresh. Atmosphere definitely not romantic, bright neon light, noisy, lively. Ideal for group of friends.
Overall better than other crab places, maybe not just my cup of tea...
2
If you have never been charged for the napkin (wet nap) at any place in the world, then go here. What started out nice with a pot of tea, lotus seeds and the wet nap, I thought was a nice welcome, none of which I ordered. Surprise they will add on 6 S$ to your bill. There are no other napkin options like paper or cloth. When I complained, the answer was all Chinese restaurants do that. 1. I did not know it was Chinese and 2 I have been to many and never ever heard of such a thing. They did eventually take the charge off the bill which still came to 125 S$ for two. Expensive even by Singapore standards. Expect an average beer to cost 15 S$.Service was robotic. Skip it! Too many other nice places around the area
1
This place is a rip off! Service hopeless, food garbage, but the most outstanding thing of all is the cynical gouge by forcing customers to pay for towels and tea. No napkins on the table so you are forced to use the towels if you are having crab. Didn't ask for the tea but was charged anyway. This is the MOST outrageous theft I have ever experienced in all my travels around the world. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. They are thieves
3
The restaurant was nothing special. We really enjoyed the steamed green vegetables and the chilli mixture the crab was in was yummy. The crab we ate was not fresh and were told it comes from Scotland. While it tasted nice, it wasnt worth the SGP$85. I wont be rushing back
5
The food that was pre ordered by the hosts turned out to be excellent.Only snag is they are usually short of wait staff but still, cant complain.The seafood variety on order was pretty good and the dessert too.If not for the haze, would be better sitting outside facing the river
5
Flavour, atmosphere and fun. From the moment we sat down the staff were friendly, efficient and very helpful in recommendations. Food was fresh and some memorable dishes including the combination seafood and black pepper crab. If you are seated outside the view is relaxing and atmosphere is fun. highly recommended
5
This has become one of my fave places to eat with folks every time I visit Singapore. It's classic Singaporean. Chili crab. Family style. Open air seating. Easy walk from CBD.* Get both chili crab and pepper crab, with the bread for soaking up the sauce. NOM! Soooo good.* Get ready to get messy! They have bibs if you want. And several sinks in the back if you need to wash up between rounds. :)* Great for large groups. Several big round tables for 6-8 people, easily.* Open air restaurant with humongous ceiling fans to cool us down.* We enjoyed the 25 min stroll there, all along the river from the CBD. Lots of people watching and activity along the way.* Don't forget the Tiger beer
3
We were keen to have seafood with travelling out to the east coast, and be close to the city. We had the chili and pepper crabs, as well as the drunken prawns and crispy squid. Not the best food quality compared to the authentic seafood places. We have been here a few times before, and the food was not as good as last few times. This restaurant has very large tables, so good for large groups
5
Four of us ordered an appetiser, two crabs cooked in two methods, buns, fried hor-fun, vegetables. The kitchen accommodated our request for less salty & less oily. It was a hearty & memorable meal. Warm and sincere wait-staff, spacious environment.
5
I love this restaurant... The food is delicious and I love the crab
Each time that I go to Singapore I always go to Red House.
4
We were a group of 11, so we took the SGD 888++ menu for 10 persons plus some extras. With the beverages it came at SGD 1,500, pretty expensive even for Singapore, which seems to fight for the most expensive city in the world:). However, food was great, especially Chilli Crab and Razor Clams. Waiters barely speak any English, but can manage somehow. Restaurant packed with mostly Chinese originated guests (which is a good sign). Male toilet located pretty odd, you have to pass through some hall connected to kitchen. Not exactly a romantic or Michelin Star restaurant, but good for large groups, as we were and nice culinary experience. I am not sure what I will remember few years from now, it will be food or the price:)))
3
We also were recommended to go here by the concierge. Chilli crab was excellent but very expensive for what we got. We had the wasabi prawns, which were great. Be careful of tourist trap extra charges. Tea and hand wipes are brought to the table straight away, and then charged to your bill. Make sure you tell them that you don't want these extras. Check your bill too because it's easy to get overcharge
4
Visiting Singapore prior to 3 year expat assignment and decided to follow Anthony Bourdain's recommendation on Chili Crabs. Visited Red House with recommendation of our concierge. We selected the Chili crab with white pepper and a 3 item appetizer but Mr. Sonny wisely and professionally discussed that the options and we quickly and happily changed to the Chili Crab with red sauce and the Calamari appetizer. The squid was outstanding, the crab was very good but nothing to rave about. Service was very good, ambiance was welcoming. We were early diners and place was filling up by 7:30 when we left. A bit pricey with the single crab, the calamari, and one beer $165 Singapore (the pint of beer was $17.00). We will go back but will probably ask Sonny to recommend something other than the crab. Lots of the other choices looked wonderful
2
It's expensive by Aussie standards and looks just like a mass food outlet in a shopping mall. So there's nothing romantic about it. We had a table of 5... the meals came out ad hoc, one meal was totally forgotten and so was the large fried rice for the table. So we waited as meals went cold for one of us to get a meal & for the fried rice to arrive. In the end the food was lovely, service not so good, the bill expensive and atmosphere pretty ordinary. Hmmmm we'll try another seafood joint tomorrow or the next day.
5
I visited this resturant on my hosts recommendation while on my first and only vist to Singapore.The group I was traveling with was focused on the chili crab. I found the ambiance ok, nothing great. We had beer and crabs, I don’t recall if we ordered any other food. Service was good, but nothing outstanding. I believe we had a choice of crab type, but do not recall which type of crab was ordered.We ordered both chili & pepper crab. (mostly Chili crab)My friends had talked up the chili crab for days, so my expectation was very high.The chili crab was very, very good……….but I was REALLY taken by their Pepper crab. It was just the most Delicious thing I had ever eaten.If you are in Singapore and like crab, you just have to try this place………it was just great
4
Came here with family for a birthday celebration. Food is yummy and service staff are attentive. The chilli crab is not too bad. However if you do not like the sweet kind of chilli crab, then is may not be for you. The cord fish and the cantonese crispy chicken are not too bad. Will come back again
2
Had been to Soi 60 night before for amazing thai meal. Saw this place and thought would be good to have seafood so got the set menu. Chilli crab was ok, underwhelmed by other dishes. There was extra charges for the tea and towel brought out at start and u had to tell them if you didn't want it. Dishes brought out one after another before we had finished. Service was terrible and felt ripped off
3
Went there tonight for dinner. I ordered the lobster. It was meant to be 800grams. Was 88 dollars. Very small and I doubt it was 800 grams. However, it was well cooked and tasty. Good service. Very helpful team. I'd suggest you order something else. Food going to other tables looked good....
5
Went for dinner and had the yummiest food. Absolutely delicious and very attentive service. One of the best meals we had in Singapore.
4
Good seafood, had nice duck for starter, ensured we asked for it to come first. Had cod for main, and seafood rice, all very nice! Did have to ask a couple of times to get another beer! Service was a bit chaotic.
1
Was surprised to encounter such bad service in a very efficient country. Service is slow and customers have to rush to the dim sum cart to serve themselves before the food runs out
4
On viewing the photo menu we were a little nervous, but the food was superb, service a little slow. We did recommend and would go back again.
5
The Red House at the Quay is known for its crab. But if you want to try the best crispy cereal prawns in Singapore then this is for you! Chris the owner sources the best quality seafood for his dishes and it shows in the delicacy of this dish in particular. Also try the steamed Scottish bamboo clams with minced garlic.Grab a table outside, order a beer and and enjoy an excellent seafood meal
4
I'm a big fan of crab, so we try anywhere there's a suspicion of good crab. This was a good try.Setting is very tranquil along the quay and everybody's relaxing over their dinner.The main dish, the crab was very good. Pricey, but still very good
5
A open restaurant next to the water.Mixed people,locals and westerners. A really nice choice of see food.A lot of people eating so the food is quite fresh. The chilly crab here is really nice,for 2 person's a crab of 1,5 kg is enough,with a small starter.Just try
3
Brought my overseas friend to dinner at Red House last night. The chilli crab turned out to be quite disappointing. It wasn't Sri Lankan crab. The meat texture tasted like fish eggs and not much meat. Strongly recommend seaweed tofu with enoki mushroom and baby Kailan with garlic. These two dishes turned out to be a consolatio
4
I went with friends for dinner. Table was the on outside next river which is better that the ones inside as it s not busy. It was very relaxing atmosphere from table location and delicious seafood dinner with a glass of beer is just a good one to have at one evening in Singapore. I personally like Red House at Robertson Quay better than Jumbo at Clark Quay or Riverwalk because it's less busy and hurry in the restaurants. Food taste is great and service is good. However the price is high specially if you order what staffs recommend. They tend to push for expensive menu without telling you the price range. Their crab dishes are great. I tried different cooking styles and I recommend pepper crab. Enjoy
4
Nice restaurant along the river. First, they served tea and hand towel (I didnt know it came with a price until I saw the receipt, very minimal).I ordered for mixed seafood which was good actually, wasnt that spicy. It had shrimps, squid, fish and I thought it was scallops. The sauce was thick and really had a great taste to it. I also had their seafood fried rice and it was delicious too. For dessert I had mango pudding, they milk they served it with was tasty, really good. For take away i had egg tarts. The pastry as subtly flaky which made it really good. Overall it was a good experience.
5
I love this restaurant... The food is incredible and delicious...
Each time that I go to Singapore I go to eat there... I am counting the days to go again...
4
according to my host, this restaurant is the 3rd highest-rated crab-serving restaurant in Singapore (Jumbo restaurant and No Signboard being the others). while i myself did not eat the crab (i am not fond of fighting with the shell and claws and getting gravy all over my clothes, the duck and kangkong in sambal sauce were quite good. everyone else in the group, however, gave high praises to the chili crab and egg-rolled crab.
2
Usually when I see people complain about places being expensive on here I think, "They're probably just cheap..." I'm siding with these people this time around! Red House came highly recommended. But Red House recently shut down its original location and created two new locations. From what I see they lost the original charm. This feels like you're in a characterless urban mall that feels more America than Singapore. Our experience:As we were seated we were presented with some pickled beans and tea. "Nice gesture" I thought. Warning - they showed up on the check. The waitress was very anxious for us to order. We ordered spinach, custard lobster and their signature black pepper crab. Starters and mains all came at once and it quickly became difficult to navigate the meal. We are from Virginia and live in Maine so we're used to the trickiness of eating lobster and crab. But this was the messiest meal we've ever had. Be ready to ask for a lot more napkins & finger bowls! The crab was ok and the lobster was messy but pretty tasty. The tab came to $175. NOT WORTH IT! Have your hotel recommend a good local place and leave this place for those "...born every minute.
5
It's a group dinner we chose not too far from hotel therefore did not expect much for foods. But it ended up with a surprise that the food quality and services are both very good in Singapore standard. The chilly crab is very good and other foods' taste are not any worse. There're three locations of Red House in Singapore and we went to the Princep one, nicely situated with some other bars around it, in a old part of city I think. Not very cheap yet the prices of foods are fair with the quality. We then went another time again in a smaller group and again enjoyed it
4
We dined at the Robertson Quay location. The location is beautiful. The food was great (including the chili crab). Very good presentation. There were wait staff and bus people galore, always someone ready to help. There is even a "trough" hand washing station outside of the bathroom, if that is all you need! Delicious and recommended
2
Been there a couple of times as i live nearby, actually Red House was the restaurant in Singapore where I had my first taste of Chili Crab. And I remember the Chili crab being very tasty and good! However, that was not the same outlet as this one.Red House have a good variation of food items on the menu, mostly seafood but also other dishes such as a very good crispy duck. However, the quality of the food doesn't weigh up for the lack of service.The two last times i've been there this happened:1. I brought a guest with me and we were going to Red House for food, we ordered the food around 9pm and waited. After around 30-45 minutes we tried to get in touch with the waiters and the same waiter that took our order saw us and ran over to the pc inside and came out with the order note which stated that the order had been taken 2 minutes ago. So apparently he forgot to enter the order.We paid the beer and cancelled the food and left.2. We tried to get the attention of the staff standing next to our table who was more interested in talking to colleagues or looking into the restaurant. Got the order done after a while and got the food served and thats about it. They all disappeared and went inside to have food so I had one glass of wine in over one hour. There was no refill or anyone to tend to the table.I understand that they need food too, but as a note to the management at Red House "Maybe you should split up the food breaks so theres someone who can attend the customers??"Anyway, I like the food but not coming back cause the service is non existent. Lots of other great outlets down the river so don't waste your money here
1
Do not go to this place. We had the set menu 78 dollars per person. We also had one coconut juice and one coke and the bill came to 203 dollars. The crab was not fresh and the lobster noodle was disgusting. We couldn't eat all the food because it was bad quality. Trust me go somewhere else. Food is not fresh and quality is bad for its price! Definitely the worst restaurant we have been too. Jumbo was similar In price but tastes so much better

We dined at the Princep St branch, and found this to be average only.The seating and room are not welcoming or comfortable.The food was OK, but not noteworthy. For a seafood restaurant, I found it strange that they recommended a chicken dish. The food was tasty but poorly presented.Service was sparse and perfunctory (except Terry, who was very good).Value was OK, but not good for what we got.Not recommended
3
The location is nice - set by the river. But that's about what's good with this place.The quality of food is average. The menu selection is standard like with all Crab House restaurants - they don't offer any outstanding dish. We ate better dishes and excellent specials from Guan Kitchen on River Valley Road without having to pay so much like Red House charges. We spent almost $280++ for ordinary chilli crab, cereal prawns and stir fried vegies and 2 glasses of wine.Service is also inconsistent - some tables were served better, whilst others had to almost sing and dance to get attention.We have visited Red House before and this was our fourth - as we kept thinking it may be getting better - but no. So this was our last visit. Lesson learnt

Went to the restaurant at East Coast. The seafood is well-cooked and many of the famous dishes such as Chilli Crab (you can try other ways of cooking too such as black pepper crab etc), Lobster noodles are great. Go in the evening and enjoy the evening sea breeze. Have cold beers with your food. You will enjoy the experience
5
We loved all the food, especially the cereal prawns and soup. So accommodating for a group of five. Location on river is really nice, big fans and for some reason, less humidity than usual!
2
Everyone's food arrived at different time, mine never arrived despite asking 4 times. It was also expensive. The quality of the food was good.
5
Had authentic Japanese food with Beer on the house. Crab was amazing and you might find good vegetarian food aswell. Cost is a little high but worthwhile experience
4
location was excellent nearby river.
Taste of chillycrab and coconut shrimp was excellent!
Friced rice was also good.
Finally, price was reasonable not so expensive.
3
Our group had dinner in this spacious restaurant. We had the deep fried fritter , drunken prawns, sauteed grouper fillet , spinach tofu , sauteed green vegetables with garlic, and the specialty chili crab. Although we liked the food, particularly the crab, we noticed that each order took time to be served, it was like in a fine dining establishment but it was actually not, because of the way food was handled, with hygienic measures should be in question . For better ambiance make sure to reserve alfresco by the river
5
This is my favorite place in Singapore for Chilli Crabs. The restaurant is quite spacious and has a lovely open-air feel to...being right next to the waterfront adds to its charm. The service is quick and friendly, and the staff advises well on food and quantities. I also love their creamy lobster and kailan. Red House should definitely be on your must-visit list if you are in Singapore and you like seafood! The only slight down-side is that it is a little heavy on the pocket...but the food is well worth it
4
The redhouse is a quite large restaurant where one can sit inside or outside (recommended in Singapore). There are quite some tourists in this area but also a lot of local people eating here.We had the full set menu with the black pepper crab which was absolutely fabulou
4
We had a great time at the Red House last night. The staff were helpful and cheerful which always helps. Our waiter assisted with our order portion sizes etc....for example I did not know that there were three types of crab to choose from and I guess we would not know one from another! The Chilli Crab was the best we have tasted so far in Singapore with a sauce to die for. We also had some Mee Goreng (excellent) Bay Kai-Lag with garlic......so good. Not cheap but worth it.The only negative was the two iced lemon teas which like drinking 100% syrup so we changed those for a jug of Asahi beer
3
We really enjoyed our supper but quite shocked when we got the bill, for two of us came to 162 Singapore dollars. This is what we had:I soda 4.00, 1 lime juice 5.50, 1 tiger beer 13, 1 chilli crab (plenty for 2) 97.50, 4 mantou buns 3.60, 1 kang kong sambal 12, 2 rice 2. With service and tax came to 162 dollars. Service was good and staff friendly , but wished we'd known price first
5
Red House serves up fantastic local seafood dishes and a great offering of Chinese food in general. Notably, our favorite dish from this occasion was the steamed sea bass (you can choose other types of fish) in soy sauce. The fish was cooked just right, was very tasty, and was particularly good value
4
after get bored with jumbo and longbeach, we try this place after many recommendation from my Singapore friend.
and the chilli crab prove that recommendation, that's it. mission accomplish !!
5
Whenever I am in Singapore, I must come and eat in this lovely place. It's the best maker of the amazing chili crab. The chili prawns are also yummy and delicious. It's a very friendly and cozy place that suits all groups and occasions.
5
The chilly crab-eating it was crazy and the gravy was all over my shirt-but the taste was to die for!!!Had the full course dinner and it was par excellence
4
A very noisy restaurant that really isn't aimed at tourists. Superb food and large portions too. Big tables and lots of corporate dinners going on when we visited. A lovely dinner with lots of different dishes, this was my second visit.
4
I was taken to the Red House Seafood Restaurant by business colleagues. I was the first to arrive and my host is a regular with table already set up and his alcoholic drinks already on the table. Although in a busy area which is full of tourists and locals the atmosphere appears to be very social with a real mixture of families, business people and friends all enjoying an early Friday evening meal. My colleague ordered so we had prawns, fish and finally chilli crab. All were excellent and well presented. The service was very attentive, but this may well be because my host is such a regular patron. All in all I enjoyed the whole experience and upon my next visit to Singapore I would happily go back to the Red House, praise enough in a location where really good restaurants are, in my experience, rare
4
me and my family came to this restaurant but not so sure about this restaurant but since we want seafood then we tried.We ordered salted egg crab, steam garlic crab, black pepper crab and chill crab. The winner is Salted egg crab, oh my the crab meat is so juicy, succulent, the salted egg taste make the complexity taste that lingered on your taste bud.The black pepper crab also very good, but taste so strong, the steam garlic crab came after the black pepper its kinda disturbed our taste bud , after a very strong flavour of black pepper crab. The Steam almost no taste, The chill crab so delicious, I loved eating it with manta. the fish steam also tast
4
The Red House is situated near the river. A nice place for a good dinner,The card is great, the food is excellent. Staff is business oriented, but helpful.What is especially great is the typical local Chile Crab or Pepper Crab. As part of a complete meal this is great. The only disadvantage is that wine is included in the meal offer. This is not great and cannot be exchanged for a beer.So, again this is a kind of business orientation which is not always nice for its customers, In this case especially since alcoholic beverages in Singapore are heavily taxed (and as such very expensive
4
After a recommendation from a couple who live in Singapore we had the Chilli Alaskan Crab. We were told up front the cost. It was very pricey,$$$, but the crab was oh so good. Would highly recommend this restaurant for its Chilli Crab. It was the perfect way to end our Asian Odyssey. Service was good. We had no reservation, but only waited about 10 minutes for table
1
1.6 kilo of Alaskan King Crab for $316 which tasted great but arrived 50 minutes after ordering. Pickles never arrived, Tiger beer was flat and then a charge of $7.20 for tea and towels. Total bill S$476.70. Full disclosure was made on the cost of crab but slow service, poorly paced and the "little extras" hardly seem like good value in comparison to other global dining spots in the US and Europe. I doubt we will ever return and it's a neighborhood spot for us. 
4
I really wanted to taste the duck as I was told te cuisine was exceptional. And it was delicious. A peking duck with all the preparations that you expect. The service was ok, probably because it was late and they were tired. No problem, we enjoyed our meal
4
Party of 5 on business , round tables and low noise level mKe for suitable ambience.
Duck was exceptional and steamed green wrasse.
4
Had the Marble Goby fish. Even though it was steamed instead of fried (as I wanted), it tasted great. The service was quick and restaurant very lively in the evening.
This location is open from 3pm onwards only.
5
Top fresh products. Very attentive staff. An incredible location by the river. Probably the best chinese restaurant I have been to.

Singapore has two kind of places:Tourist traps and other. Robertson quay is not considered as tourist trap, although is more expensive than 'other places' (excluding Dempsey Hill). I don't find this place good value for money. Knowing Singapore well, I felt pity for the visitors sitting around me paying a lot more than what they would in the same outlet but elsewhere in town. I'm usually not taking my guests there...quality of food..I would say common. The overall dinning feels like first class food court...but not a riverside restaurant. I don't recommend this place
4
This is probably a 3.5 star restaurant but that’s not an available rating so I am giving Red House the benefit of the doubt. We ate here several nights ago and, while charged for the wet wipes, tea and small dish of fried something, we didn’t get the plastic bib (though at least one in our party would have been happy, in retrospect, to pay for one). The reviewers who complain about the costs are correct in that this is not a cheap place to eat. It’s riverside in Robertson Quay where nothing is really cheap (though see my review of Bar Bar Black Sheep). We had reservations for a Sunday evening but really didn’t need them as the place was less than half full. The Formula 1 race was that evening but I don’t think it had much effect on the patronage. We sat inside and while, like most places along the river from Boat Quay to Robertson Quay, it wasn’t air-conditioned that wasn’t a problem for us. You can see from the photo at the top of the TripAdvisor page that there are some giant ceiling fans and we were under the outer edge of one of those and got a nice breeze from it. Those fans are not located throughout, so I can’t speak for how it was elsewhere in the room. Service was attentive and excellent in all respects. We had two chili crabs, one lobster in Thai sauce, greens, stir-fried beef, a fried fish and a basket of small rolls. Given the amount of sauce on the crabs and lobster I’m not sure how anyone can form an opinion on the taste of the meat. I’d never had the Thai sauce before and it was excellent. I even used one of the rolls to dip in the sauce just to get more of it. The fish was in a sauce, too, but it wasn’t overpowering and the fish was well cooked. I had several pieces of the beef and all but one were exceedingly tender. There is nothing charming about the dining room. It is very bright and I’m sure it can get very noisy. There is a large sink near the restrooms on the back wall. I strongly suggest getting some paper towels from it before beginning your meal. The wet wipe you pay for is woefully insufficient.Thank you for reading. If you found this helpful I will appreciate a Yes vote below

One of the best meals I have ever eaten. It is a drive out of the city but well worth it. We try 3 kinds of crab.....all of them were simply amazing. Make sure that you go to the correct restaurant as many have stated there are lots of restaurants in the area. The tea and towel charges are truly ridiculous especially considering how expensive our bill was we had 5 people and order a ridiculous amount of food.....worth every dollar and every bit was delicious. We ate outside. The view of all of the ships in the bay is amazing. It is definitely casual and the decor is not fancy
4
Went there on 13 Sep 2014 as a group of 7. Had a great service, especially we want to thank Mr.Tan and his team who served our table that evening. We ordered chilli crab and pepper crab. Both were fantastic.Other side orders were also very good.Tip1:If ordering mantau/buns order early as it may take a while for them to come. We had to ask once before it was served. No complaints as they were hot and fresh.Tip2: If you are a small group try to book outside table next to river. But better to sit inside if larger group.Only complaint was the waitress taking our order was so tired and couldn't even have a smile on her face. This made us bit wary of service. But the waiters serving our table made up for it.All in all a great place to have famous crab dishes of Singapore. The price would be approx 50-60 per pax not including drinks. Bit pricey compared to other places in Singapore, you pay premium for the location

During our trip in Singapore all we wanted was to have chilli crab. We went with husbands boss and were not disappointed. We tried the squid combo, two out of three of them were OK. We then went on to duck pancakes, the duck came out as a half duck that you have to pull apart, this was cool, the pancakes were tiny picklets, not enough to eat with all of the duck! Then we got the chilli crab, it's not what I expected, it's a stew type dish with the crab in pieces but you have to crack most of it open, not too much crab meat but I guess we had to experience it. Don't wear anything fancy and be prepared to get very messy, even whilst wearing a bib
1
We were also given tea and beans/nuts we did not ask for!!! The crab was from Scotland!!!! It probably would have tasted better if I was there. The sauce was just a bottle of sweet chilli sauce, did not seem homemade a very disappointing experience. Wouldn't rush back!
4
Red House Restaurant's location along the Singapore River & its good ambience makes it a worthwhile visit . it is one of the peaceful locations to enjoy an evening outing .Variety of Seafood , cooked in traditional style & well presented is good for sea food lovers. Staff is helpful in selecting various types of food & prompt in serving. Though mainly Non Vegetarian , Red House caters to some Vegetarian dishes , particularly salads with variety of Soy Tofu and nicely sauntered vegetables . Freshly baked mini buns are delicious 
4
On a two-day stopover we were underwhelmed by the pricey, noisy, construction-bent Singapore. IN just a few months (last visit December 2013) Singapore has changed and not for the best. It was with relief then that we were treated to a well-cooked meal, plated professionally and with care on our last night when we expected just another ordinary to awful food experience costing the earth. The beef in black pepper sauce and chicken with mango, two dishes to share, were delicious. Our quibble is the charge for wet wipes and tea and the mandatory small dish of peanuts! All up this was $7.80 worth, an unnecessary cost
4
When you walk in this area, there are so many restaurants that unless.you have clear reference you may spend the night wondering where to stop, but the Red House catches immediately your attention: there are so many local people that it MUST BE good. It really was! We had crabe, lobster and a delicious steamed fish (I don't remember the name but it was big and it was lozenge-like) in a place certainly crowded but now we know the reason
2
The food is okay but be warned. Our bill: 2x corona $18, tiny bowl steamed rice $1.80, seafood combo $28. Fine with that - BUT tea, water, towel $3.60, pickle $3.00, didn't order didn't have then more rice which we didn't see. Bill came to $65.20! Ridiculous
1
I was at this restaurant quite recently with some friends. We had average food and typical poor Singapore service, a dishonest manager and a disingenuous owner, I just order a small chili crab and a few dishes after they sever us a small peanut but I never order we never eat it the staff didn't tell us it on charge !draft beer also not fresh and the food we waiting long long time ,I calling the staff half hour no respond was really bad experience
4
I like this place, although you can end up getting your food the wrong way round it is all very tasty, highly recommend the sweet and sour prawns, scallops and broccoli, seafood fried rice , the Hong Kong style sea bass and mmmmm the black pepper crab nom nom, all washed down with some warmish tiger beer but nice honest food.......love it
3
I went to this restaurant for the Singapore chili crab as it is listed in some sites as one among the five best places for crab in Singapore. A 1 kg Sri Lanka crab comes for 58 SGP$; with a pint of beer and a wet towel (yes, they charge for the towel as well!), 80 SGP$. That could be fine if the crab was fantastic, but while the animal was quite meaty, the taste was so-so, and also I quite disliked the sauce (I chose the chili stew): sweetish and not spicy at all. Also the service, while fast, leaves ample margin to improvement: I ordered a bowl of white rice and could not have it, even reminding the waiters twice
4
I have been to Red House thrice in one year and the consistency in flavor is mind blowing. The food by and large is excellent and extremely fast service. The ambiance and general appearance of the place is nothing to write home about...very plain and simple. Ideal if you wanna quick and tasty meal before you hit a bar on Robertson Quay. Recommended dishes are; seafood fried rice, mixed spice seafood, sesame chicken, kang kong and the crab and sweet corn soup. You don't necessarily need to book early as there is plenty of seating...quick turn around too. Be prepared to pay approximately 30 bucks per head.
4
Stayed at a hotel in Clarke Quay and was recommended this restaurant. We had chili crabs, seafood horfun, kangkong, tofu, and fried buns and came to 200over dollars for 7 of us. A bit expensive but everything was tasty and food was served in a timely manner. Overall, came out very satisfied
1
Absolutely so disappointed!Totally over rated, how you can be charged for napkins when you eat crab is just beyond me...not even a paper or fabric napkin on the table, but want to charge you for packaged wet towelettes.Average food and shocking service and so over priced
1
The service was terrible the waiters had attitude and were very rude. They charged us for tea which we did not ask for and were unaware of chargers, they claimed that if we didn't stop them from pouring it meant we wanted it. They also charged us for napkins, which is ridiculous as how can you eat chilli crab without needing to wipe or dry your hands! We ordered the duck pancakes in order to do so you have to buy a duck, chilli crab and rice. The rice came first after we clearly stated we wanted the duck first then to have a 10 minute break. The duck then came and after seconds the rice and crab along, they clearly do not understands the wants and needs of their customers which is appalling also considering we had to ask 2 times for the bottle of wine we ordered. After our entrÃ©e and mains they failed to pick up plates and clean our table. My family and I are serious foodies and have had plenty of experiences with Chinese, this restaurant is overpriced, the waiters have major attitude, i definitely would recommend looking elsewhere for Chinese in singapore
4
Though the service started off slow, the food was superb when it did come. Bamboo clams, Lobster (best ever), Crabs, Scallops, Fish .. all wonderful!
4
Excellence fresh seafood, however quite busy
Service is good
Location is riverside good
Would recommended for seafood lover
5
Always come here while I visit Singapore .Love the Chili Crab and the prawn....so good!.will comeback!
4
We visited their Prinsep branch. Enjoyed much the creamy custard prawns. Never really been a fan of chili crab and the creamy custard prawn made it even harder for me to enjoy it. ;)
4
Fantastic crab (ginger and spring onion) and a whole array of other dishes (soup, mixed veg rice, tofu, greens, razor shellfish, shrimps)
Shrimps were amazing, crab very yummy.
Dessert too (coconut ice-cream, mango pudding)
4
Good food, especially the Peking Duck. Definitely great experience having dinner at the Robertson Quay.
4
How can you visit Singapore and not try Chilli Crab? Red House is convenient and comfortable and the service was great.
We enjoyed the lay back atmosphere and the attentive but not intrusive service.
A good night out.
4
Had a dinner at Red house seafood to celebrate Father's Day. We used to go to jumbo for past 3-4 seafood dinner gatherings but decided to change to something different. Food quality - good , delicious. Ambience - reasonable. Service - ok no complaints. Price - expensive . I suppose this is the price you have to pay to eat delicious tasty chilli crab in singapore. Prob worth coming back if feel like splurging.
4
visited Biz trip for half day. in JUN 2014. Asked local food and my colleague advised me this restaurant. Food was good enough due to sauce, had to change napkins several time. but it was quite to stand for wonderful taste. and the Tiger beer. I'll never forget it
4
Red House is THE place to be for the Singaporean chili crab!The large selection of crabs is Also supported by an extensive sea food menu including plenty of squid dishes and excellent bamboo and razor clamsWhy not 5 stars? The place is quite simple and the service nothing specialPS - portions are hug
5
Chili crab of course, great sauce. Drunken prawns in a very tasty subtle broth. Nice evening watching the pedestrians stroll by along teh river. Not for a business dinner, but good for a local night out.
3
We figured that since it was our last night in Singapore we would try the name sake crustacean, we'd asked several places for the market price so we could better decide where we would dine on this dish.We chose Red House because though it was a little more expensive it was closer to the hotel and we couldn't be bothered going to far from the hotel.The flavour was nice the crab sweet and worth the price per kilo, BUT the service was less than we have received anywhere else and fell well short of our expectations, the tea, peanuts & 1 wet wipe you assume was part and parcel ended up as an extra charge and was a bit of a sneaky charge, the thing that p!$$3d me off the most was the rudeness of the staff towards my wife
5
It’s not complete to visit Singapore without eating its infamous CRAB. Yes, you have to get dirty and using your hand to eat this black pepper crab. I am a super messy eater (w/ my hands, mind you). So I was beyond happy when I knew they served this easy-to-handle crab. Some parts of the crab are already pre-cracked for your convenient. It was so finger licking tasty ;) One of the best meal I’ve ever had in Singapore
1
This restaurant was rated as one of the top 5 Singapore restaurants for chilli crab, which is evidently a must-try. The restaurant was crowded so it looked like it must be good. Well. We sat outside but had no view of the river-- so much for ambiance. Everything was so loud that we couldn't even talk to each other at the table. The service was terrible--we didn't get the beer we ordered until we asked several times and the waitress basically disappeared after taking our initial order. There is a division of labor that makes no sense and the beverage servers couldn't speak English. The chilli crab was OK but not worth the price (about $100 each) and why were we provided no forks to get the crabmeat out out of the shell or paper napkins to wipe up with after this messy dinner? We each had just one packaged wipe that we couldn't even open because our hands were so messy. We were charged a setup for the "tea/water/napkins" even though we didn't even order tea or these horrible cold bean things. The waitress removed all those bogus charges from the check, but it was still incredibly expensive and we couldn't get out of there fast enough. I'm usually pretty easy to please but this was one unpleasant evening
3
We were a grioup of 20 - 22 persons with advance reservation, arrived there, our tables were not ready, had to join tables to accommodate us, part of the group ended up on a remote table, then we had to squeez in to fit all togehter on the arranged tables. Food was good, service can be much better had to ask always for basics. The avg price we paid per person SGD 75 - 80 a little bit overpriced for the menu and service
3
We happened across this place accidentally. Since we both have a penchant for seafood and crabs we gave it a try. Well... The ingredients are there.. The quality of the seafood and crabs is very good, but the preparation is somewhat uninspired. The noise level, the service and the prices leave you with the feeling that you have stumbled across a tourist trap... Next time in Singapore we will try something else
1
went yesterday ordered chilli crab and a $20 bowel of rice there was extra charges for everything ( even the hand towels) extra service charges and taxes ontop of an already huge bill. would never recommend this place to anyone. service was far fom special also
1
We just had our dinner at Red House Seafood Restaurant @ Prinsep St (19/03/14) to celebrate our friend birthday tonight. The waiter was very familiar about the food and he recommended us marvelous dishes. The food was great but the service was very disappointing.Since this is our first time here, we asked a lot of questions to know about the food and need more time to decide our choices. This must be a rough night, because the waiter who served us was impatience. We noticed that on how he responded to our question harshly and seems belittle us when we said the order wrongly. He served the food hurriedly until some soup was spilled on the table.Earlier on, we asked him to keep the birthday cake first as a surprise for our friend. Then, after the dinner was almost finished, we requested him to serve us the birthday cake. And the worst part happened. I can understand that there were still some plates and food left and he intended to clean the table first. When my friend said that she's still eating, he said harshly that he needed to clean the table to serve the cake. well, he stopped after that and he returned to the kitchen and brought back the birthday cake, still in the box, and drop it on the table. Can you imagine how it feels to be treated that way? We were completely stunned and very disappointed. It supposed to be a HAPPY birthday surprised, but ended up seems like it's nothing. "People comes for the food, and returns because of the service"Definitely we will not consider back to this restaurant
3
Upselling:They try to nickle and dime you for every little extra thing without asking: tea, napkins, nuts. So if you don't want something, make certain you say so before they bring it (or right when they get to the table).The waitress recommended the Chili Crab using Alaskan King Crab as the most flavorful. The price wasn't too bad for Alaskan King; at 188 SGD per kilo* it's competitive with the market price in the US. The downside is that the minimum order - even for one person - is 1.5 kilos.Since I don't expect to return to Singapore anytime soon, I decided to go all out. (And just to break up the flavor, I had a couple of steamed buns and a small side of custard prawns.) Although the chili crab was very tasty, there can, indeed, be too much of a good thing. It would be better if they let solo diners order an appropriate amount for one person. *A note about TripAdvisor's cost rating: It was very expensive, but it was not formal or "special occasion" dining, so their criteria don't really fit this dining experience
4
We went there early on Sat afternoon as we're leaving on 8:00 pm flight. Not much restaurant has opened yet. We tour around few ones at that area and decided to pick the Red House, it's seems cheaper and it offers white pepper crab. We tried the white pepper crab, fried rice, deep fried squid and vegi, nice food, good service
4
Located right by the river in busy Robertson Quay area. Friendly service and lots of different kind of seafoods, from shark fin soup to all kinds of crabs/prawns/lobsters. Food was real tasty and fresh, so no complaints
4
Busy big restaurant full of locals, great seafood and buzzy atmosphere. Not cheap and a competitive market but still recommend. PS not the place for fancy clothes / fine dining
3
We went to this restaurant to try the iconic Singapore Chilli Mud Crab. On entry you are given a white plastic bib to preserve your clothes which is a great idea. You are also offered some tea, and nuts, and hand towels. All of which are later added to your bill. The food was good, but not special, the chilli mud crab was good but the entrees we ordered, spring rolls and noodles were nothing special at all. The dining room was very noisy. Overall we were a bit disappointed with the food and service and then disappointment turned into being annoyed at all the extras added to the bill. I think you can probably find much better food, service and value at plenty of other places in Singapore
4
This is not a fancy restaurant but this is signature Singapore! The chili crab is a mess to eat but is truly delicious. A must have! The kang kong vegetable preparation is wonderful. The egg yolk prawns are a classic. You can hardly miss in this restaurant with the wonderful, helpful waitstaff and fabulous food preparation
5
Ahh, I wish I was in Singapore right now. I am craving the chilli crab and the black pepper crab at this place. I was in Singapore in September and tried this place and found it to be the best chilli crab place in town. I went to Jumbo, No Signboard, Palm Beach and Red House while I was there and this was my favorite place out of all four of them. Highly recommended for a chilli crab aficionado
4
When in Singapore.. we wanted to try the chilli crab and Red House was recommended by our hotel (Raffles). The restaurant is on the river front and we were able to get a table outside which was a good start. We ordered both a lobster in cream (sorta like satay sauce) dish and then the famous chilli crab. Have to say the chilli crab was quite nice but the lobster was sensational (though the price at the end of the night was a bit of a shock...).Restaurant itself is not glam - you come for the food and location. Service was fine (but nothing out of the ordinary).Think I would do the longer drive out to Long Beach for the black pepper crab next time..
4
Make sure you read the menu correctly here, and know what you're getting, as ordering the wrong the of crab can add hundreds to your bill! The drunken prawns, and chilli crabs are obviously the highlight. The steamed buns go excellently with the chilli crab sauce
1
We each ordered the set menu at $68 per head which sounded lovely plus wine at $40, beer and G&T. What you got was ok but it turned out not enough to feed the stray cat that was wandering around. The crab was practically non existent. When we asked for the bill having sat for an hour waiting for the table to be cleared we were told we had not had our sweet. I agreed with them but said as we had waited for an hour to just knock it off the bill. The response from a range of waiters went from can't do that, we can knock off $6 from the $184 bill, to ultimately removing approx $24. We were still hungry so went to the local wine bar and ordered a cheese board which was much needed. There is plenty of choice so I'd suggest going elsewhere
5
When I asked my cousin who is a Singapore-based for good restaurant that offers best chili crab in town - this what he suggests. He booked for our dinner and YES it is one of the best. The food is so yummy and the place is good
4
All the locals told me I had to have chili crabs and this was the place to go. It's right on the river and busy,busy,busy. Luckily it's huge. Outdoor seating or indoor but no AC. While they have lots of choice I recommend starting with the razor clams and get those messy but tasty chili crabs. You do need to be ok with getting your hands dirty since the sauce is thick and sticky and you have to get the meat out of the shell
5
Red House offer a set menu which is great value. We had mudcrab, scallops and lobster including drinks for $80aud per head. The food was fantastic and I would definitely recommend it.
4
enormous crabs, very fresh/perfectly cooked steamed fish, sweet prawns..seafood fried rice had great "wok hei", and wasn't too oily..service was very obliging, particularly given how late it was
4
We tried the price fixe meal at $S 70/person. It was excellent quality food, but seemed overpriced in the end. There are other establishments serving same quality for less, in the area.
5
I have been there several times from 2003. It is one of my best food and Singapore experiences ever. It is the best place to go after 15 hours flight. Coming from Nordic winter with minus 20. You arrive in Singapore and you're friends are taking you to the East Coast Seafood Centre Red House. You are sitting outside with plus 28 (remind the cold at home!). You eat the heavenly tasting Asian food with could Tiger beer. Everyhing tastes so good. Their chilli crab is astonishing. You just forget all your troubles, long flight and you feel being in the heaven

Went there with a group, while on a business trip. The place is set up in a typical Chinese way, with large round tables on which a "lazy Susan" is used to shuttle dishes around the table to share. Had a large number of dishes, ordered by a local who knew what to get. Everything was delicious! Service was pretty slow and somewhat indifferent.The place is light with harsh fluorescent lighting, and is quite loud. Don't go here on for a romantic date dinner, or if you need to have a business meal with discussion over the meal. It's hard to hear each other across the large table
5
First of all, the service. Super friendly and they help you to make your choices. We had Chili crab and the waitress recommended to take only half a crab because otherwise it would be too much. We are glad we did, because it was delicious but expensive....!!!!. Over 350 Singapore Dollar. But ok, now we know what Alaskan Crab prices are. Lesson learned. Next time the Clam chowde
5
The restaurant is ok, location fine, beer is not bad, but all of that is put to one side when the pepper crab and chile crab arrive, heaven is awaiting you ! What more can be said. My friend captured it best "once you've finished licking your own fingers you want to start licking your neighbors fingers
5
This is the only place on the planet (I know of) that serves creamy custard prawns! Awesome!!!! By all means go the crab .... yes, but you have to have the creamy custard prawns. If you want an experience and something different go the prawns!! Ok, so the meal was not cheap but hey, you shouldn't be going there if you want cheap.....stick with the hawker markets. I'd come back for another meal.......(did I mention the creamy custard prawns?

Been to this restaurant for a few times, but this time, I felt some dissapointment. We tried the white pepper crab, but it was not great. It only had peppery taste and so plain taste. As my guests were so looking forward to it, this was dissapointment for them.I remember they served better food. The price is pretty high for what they serve. The standard may have dropped...Probably, I will not come back here
2
Let me start by saying that although the food was fine, and being on the riverside means paying more, I did not expect to pay for a NAPKIN! But there it was on the bill, alongside tea (which we DID NOT order) and $3 for pickles which again we did not order. There are many more places two minutes down the quay or better yet stroll to Chinatown for the real thing
3
Food was good. Service was not so good. Food was late and they forgot the rice, which was the most basic part of the order. Quite pricey too.
3
Paid a visit on a late Sunday morning.The entire place is pretty spacious. With a group of friends, makes the meal wonderful.Unlike a typical Chinese restaurant, where the usual noise from every table makes the environment rather restless.Had dim sum, which is quite good. Very good overall
2
Last nite we went to Red House at East Coast with a guest from Japan.Ordered 1 Male Chilly Crab and 1 Male Black Pepper Crab. Both crabs served were female.When questioned, their answer was mixed up la, the shells were Female but the parts were male. This show they are serving pre-chopped crab from the freezer not live crab.They charged me per whole crab by weight but it was not true.Even my guest said this restaurant cheat
4
Really impressed with the food here, not only a very good selection with photo menu but the quality of the food was very pleasing. We had quite a range of dishes so much so that doggy bags were called for. The only downside of this experience was that we were hurried to finish our meals and pay the bill due to the closing time of 10.30pm. I was not impressed with being presented with the bill whilst I was still eating. However, this is a busy place early evenings so probably a long night for the staff.Overall a very memorable dinner and will definately be going back soon
4
We were six persons and we had some vegetables, noodles, rice, a big chili crab (about 1kg) and grilled prawns. Including one jug of Tiger and two glasses of wine we spent about 270 SGD, that sounds quite reasonable to me. Suggestion: take at least two buns per person, as you will need them to enjoy the crab sauce.The food was very good, the service fast and efficient and the ambiance informal
4
We have been going to Red House since 1993, (also at east coast), and we think it is consistently the best black pepper crab in Singapore. We have never had a bad crab or experience there, we always take visitors and never disappointed. The salty fish fried rice always a favorite along with the cereal prawns and green veg
4
Typically, we bring our guests to Jumbo for the Singapore seafood experience. But it gets ridiculous if we couldn't get a table until 9pm even when making reservations one week out. If you are in a similar predicament, head for Red House seafood.IMHO, the food is just as good, as least as far as the main dishes are concerned. That would be the famous chilli and black pepper crabs. Another plus is the ambience. No hurried waitresses, loud crowds, etc. you get the picture
2
Restaurant was near my hotel in a nice quiet spot by the river. As a lone diner, I felt fine about being there on my own. These were the reasons I chose it.I sat outside and it was an age before anyone came for my order. The waitress couldn't speak any English so she did the next best thing, which was to leave me alone! I guess they wanted to make money on drinks so were not pleased when I asked for tea. I had a vegetarian meal which was good enough, nothing special. The service was slow, and rude and made me feel bad. I wouldn't go again,I have reviewed the prices as good, but bear in mind this is because I had a vegetarian dish and rice only, that with the tea, service charge and taxes cost $17.40
3
We decided on this place because my colleague wanted Chili Crab since it was his first visit to Singapore. We also did not want to stray far from our hotel. An internet search turned up this restaurant as the main option in Robertson Quay. The restaurant is well located overlooking the river and features open air dining. The dÃ©cor is fairly plain and favors the look of a seafarer's restaurant. We were seated promptly and our order was taken in a very timely manner. The server was very helpful in helping us sort through our choices. We decided on corn chowder as a starter and found it to be surprisingly very tasty (surprising because the specialty is seafood). For the mains, we had the chili crab, of course, as well as the spicy seafood mix. The latter was very good as it was spiced well enough to have a kick while still maintaining a full body of flavor. The chili crab was also quite good and the sweet and hot taste of the chili sauce was nicely balanced. The biggest negative was the prices as I would say they were a little expensive for the type of establishment it is (perhaps as opposed to what it thinks it is). With a minimal amount of drinks included, the bill for two was about $200 SGD, which is about $150 USD. While the food was good, it was not that good. Hence, the quality of the food was very good while the value for the price paid was marginal at best
4
We decided to order the seafood banquet for 2 so we could try several dishes and not pay too much for the crab which can be expensive as charged by the weight. We knew what we would be paying upfront. We enjoyed razor clams, lobster, lobster noodles, chilli crab, asparagus in XO sauce, dessert and a glass of wine. The outside seating tho still undercover, is more pleasant then the frenetic atmosphere and bright lights inside. While not cheap ($68++ SD pp) the banquet is reasonable value and quite an experience. Eating the crab was a messy business but worth it as it was delicious. Charging extra for tea and wet wipes is a bit much tho. One small towel is not enough to deal with the messy crab and sauce so take a pack of your own
1
I live in singapore. They tried to rip us off and charge $550 for one chilli crab thinking we were tourists. Beware.
1
Waitress over charged us for a crab. Over $500 for a crab. And didn't tell us beforehand. Shame as the rest of the food was ok. Don't recommend.
3
Went with a friend who lives here, but I would imagine I would be lost if I wandered in as a lone tourist. They served a mean chilli crab, and decent prawns, but again, all of the sides that were useful, like rice and buns, and gloves, crab crackers, and bibs, seemed to be something that saved the meal that wouldnt have been provided had someone who had been there before spoken up. And yes, it is expensive for singapore, but seems a bit strange to get totally ripped off like others mentioned (as not even the big chilli crab cost thaat much), and while service was ok, we were one of the few patrons still around near closing time. So, if you want to try the chilli crab and dont feel like venturing out of the center, ask for one medium crab, some bread and rice, and the crab gear, and you should do just fine
4
Rumored to have some of the best chili and pepper crab in town, we decided to give it a try. Locals recomend this place over Jumbo. -- chili crab is good. Ive had both Sir Lankan and the King crab, both very good. -- best thing on the menu and a favorite dish in the city? Order the Spicy Seafood Combination. Overall the food is very good, the location is nice at the quieter part of the riverfront, and a positive experience. Along the river, this is a much better option in food quality compared to any of the crab joints in neighboring Boat Quay.
2
We wanted Asian food in Singapore and this place looked appealing. The food was not tasty and did not share any Singapore flavors or inspiration. Several things appeared on the bill that were not obvious and when asked what these were; they said they were small side dishes put on the table with our order. We noted these dishes were still sitting there and had not been ordered and the waiter quickly revised the bill (minus $20). It seemed to be dishonest. How many people have just paid the bill. I tipped him for his assistance but he should not have. There are many restaurants in the area - keep walking
2
On one hand - probably one of the best places to embrace local culinary traditions. Great seafood (lobster tail salad was just amazing, scampi on grill good yet a bit overcooked). On the other - looks like cheap canteen, airconditioning virtually non-existent. Services clearly does not match the prices - waiters roaming around checking the order card on your table... Actually not much difference sitting "inside" or "outside" - the latter is just further from kitchen / closer to walking street. Selection of wines by glass is very very limited. And the place is PRICY - keep this in mind (>> USD100 for basic dinner)
2
Decided to go along the river for dinner tonight, as my husband had been recommended a chinese restaurant close to Boomerang. This was the only we found, so tried it out. First, got a table, they gave us the deepfried mushrum-snack. Then nothhing happened. After 15 minutes we had to ask a waiter to take our order - for both drinks and food. About 20 min later the first dish arrived, and as europeeans we are....we prefer to eat our food together with the rice, so asked for the rice we had ordered. It took 15 minutes from the first dish to the rice arrived. We had fried rice seafood deluxe - ok, but nothing special. Hot Pan Vension...well...the hot pan was cold when our rice arrived, taste ok - was more like ginger and spring onion. Black pepper beef - again - nothing wrong, only tasteless. Broccoli and scallop - ok, but not much broccoli comparing to the picture. Deepfried butered prawns - crispy and good, but again - very plain. The bill?? 168 SGD .. way too expensive compared to both sizes and taste. And yes, they charged for both the snack and the towels - 10 SGD
2
I saw cockroach on my table while I'm waiting for my food. I called the staff and told him about that, he went to see his supervisor without saying any words to us, and when the supervisor came and asked me what was wrong, I said I saw cockroach on my table and the cockroach still there. Then his answer surprised me and my friend! He said "why don't you move to another table?" without trying to dispel the cockroach. And another surprise was they move all the cutlery from our previous table to our new table! We thought they will gave us a new cutlery, but they don't. So disappointed!
2
Though service staff is fairly attentive, the food standards have dropped to the ground! Food is not fresh, probably frozen and heated in microwave ovens. Sad and distressing situation when remembering the glorious days of this restaurant at the corner of East Coast Road. Perhaps only suitable for short and long-term visitors are are deluded in believing that seafood is fresher and tastier along our east coast! Prices are shocking..
4
First of all, I have to say the setting was great. It was a nice blend of indoors and outdoors with a massive ceiling fan. This means no blasting air con whilst still being able to enjoy an outdoor breeze but not be sweating like a pig. Well thought out.Food was delicious and service was friendly. The main attraction is really the chilli crab and also the black pepper crab - very nicely done, tangy, delicious sauce. Side dishes were great of the noodles and the morning glory with shrimp paste. Bibs and plastic gloves were appreciated for the crab.Place is a bit pricey but I guess this is what you get for non hawker food yet still not fine dining. Service was good and would return again
4
What a nice place! despite being a seafood restaurant they catered for 3 vegetarians with ease & skill! Delicious!
2
Food here was excellent, service average. However during our meal a rather large cockroach ran out from behind a display unit and under our table. This doesn't mean the kitchen isn't clean but it certainly doesn't add to the enjoyment of the meal!
4
Ate here tonight. Great location along Robertson Quay. Ordered razor clams, grilled prawns, kong xing cai with sambal and the pepper crab......all were very tasty. Would go back for sure.
5
The spicy seafood combination is to die for. Share it with the black pepper crab and you will understand why I like this place most. Pair it with an ice cold tiger, just magic
5
We used to go out to the Eastcoast to visit the Red House, decided to try Robertson Quay for a change. The food was just as good (I did miss the beach though!) and the chilli crab was fantastic as usual. Wish I could eat there more often! :
3
Great pepper and chili crab. The Mangrove crab from Sri Lanka is excellent and 1-1.5kg more than enough. BUT really dreadful service. Also staff packing up tables on a friday night when you have not finished eating is quite off-putting!However the food is very good
3
This is my 2nd or 3rd time here, and my first review. Brought some American friends here and wanted them to taste the chili crabs but without having to travel to east coast. It's been a few years since my last visit and I realised their "indoor" seating is actually still open air i.e. no AC. It was a sweltering hot evening so I wished I had chosen another place already. We had the razor clams and tofu to start and they were average, these are not the restuarant's specialities anyway, though they say they are. We had the chilli crabs and they were ok. Well-cooked I suppose , with the gravy oozing out from every part of the crab. The buns are good with mopping up the gravy. For dessert we had the mangoes which were good. Curiously they didn't have as many local desserts as I thought. My friends enjoyed the house white though, which was a pleasant surprise. All in all, it was ok, would probably pick a place with AC next tim
4
Fantastic atmosphere, but get in early, service was fast and the place has a real buzz. A table of 5 people, one vegitarian who ate the set meal, 4 shared the Alaskan crab in chilli sauce. It was amazing. Best meal I have eaten in a long time. It is not cheap but a great experience and worth it

After a wonderful day sight-seeing in Singapore , having had a fabulous lunch in the food halls at Little India ( 8Sgd for 2 people and delicous) , we found that it was heading to 9pm and we really must have a meal somewhere before heading back , walking , to the Hotel Holiday Inn . So this looked so busy and popular , and a big advert outside offering their set courses meal and of course my husband wanted to try their chilli crab whilst in Singapore. So it said 2 set meals including 1 glass of wine each 68sgd per person , ok , it seemed a huge amount of money but then again there were several courses , so lets splash out. Firstly , whenever we sat down , outside , at Table 90 , ( still have my receipt ! ) , they bring you a pot of tea , very nice i thought , then a napkin , not realising you pay for all this at 3.60sgd. then they set down a little dish which to us in Spain is a little welcome tapa , on the house , oh no , this costs you another 3sgd and turns out , they are fermented peanuts and we dont eat peanuts. !!! Then your 1st course comes , Scottish clam s, very nice , then after that it all goes downhill. I cant believe this restaurant is rated so highly when the fish doesnt taste fresh . So my bill ended up after all that with a 10% svc chage + a further 7% Gst charge making my bill 167.80 . It was sickening paying over that kind of money for crap , when you can have the most wonderful meal all frshly cooked at Little India . We learned our lesson and would never spend this money again . Also , I should add , my husband was a diver and knows when fish & seafood are fresh . Our advice , " dont go here "

Established in 1976, this is a very well-known chain in Singapore – with a clientele both local and expat Red House has consistently great food.Grab a bib and dive into the Chilli Crab at Red House – it’s delightfully sweet while still leaving a tingle of chilli around your lips! Make sure you also get the steamed Pau (white buns) to mop up the delicious excess sauce. We came here in a group (to the Robertson Quay Branch) and sampled Deep Fried Mini Squid, Crispy Duck Szechuan Style, Sautéed Chinese Spinach in Minced Garlic as well as the famous Chilli Crab.The Mini Squid was not really to our liking, as it was more crunch than substance, but the rest of the dishes were outstanding.Service is a little stressed and slow when busy, which it seems to be every weekend – again, make sure you have a booking
4
Been here a few times most recently in Jan 2013. Compared to other joints in the East Coast Seafood Park, Red House has a 'slight' disadvantage in terms of location on not having a direct harbor view although its not a deciding factor for me, although some people prefer it. I find the tables a bit spaced from each other as compared to the other places so its a positive. Food is as always good. Chili Crab and Bamboo Clams are a must! I find the crispy chicken a bit average but other than that, excellent food
5
I've been here many times, most recently with a big group of friends. Food is consistent and good, and it's hard to go wrong on the menu. We did order "cereal prawns" this time, that was not as nice as we hoped, but otherwise everything very tasty and went over well with my friends, especially the ever-popular Singapore-style chilli crab and fried bread buns to dip in the sauce
4
Introduced to Red House by some family friends who live in Singapore we enjoyed our meal so much the first time that we had to go back again.A group of 25 diners arriving all atmonceis achallenge for most establishments but Red House simply grinned and got stuckinto making our night very enjoyable.Great service, plenty of laughs with the staff, and by the way some excellent food, made for a fun filled evening enjoyed by allReally happy to go back for a third time when we are nextin Singapor
4
We had a huge group of people from work for dinner. I think there were 8 or 9 course meal. Way too much, but all great nevertheless. The shrimp, prawn, crabs, everything was fresh and cooked to perfection. I just wished they brought the rice along with the seafood. I thought being in Asia, that's the culture. Instead they brought the vegetables separately, and the rice actually came after most of the food came out, so most people were full by then. The crabs are really to die for. Super delicious. If not too expensive, I will definitely return
4
I was taken there by work colleagues who ordered a banquet of 8 or 9 courses. All light small tastings of very delicious sea food. Great crab.As others have said it isn't cheap, and service wasn't up to American or Australian standards, but the food makes up for it. Especially if you aren't the person who is paying at the end of the day.
3
This is a good, if basic, Chinese eating house. Much better than the standard European version, but unsophisticated and noisy and BUSY. It is busy because the food is good. It is noisy because that is the way Chinese enjoy their meals out. It is open air and unsophisticated. It is crowded in the evening because the food is good. Even very good. Drink beer, not wine. Eat simple dishes. Avoid grilled fish - they over-cook it. Go for veg, fish in sauces and fried rice and you will love it
4
On a Saturday night in early November at about 10pm I wandered down to Robertson Quay and chose this restaurant with nice outdoor seating. Not many diners were left at that point and service was speedy. I opted for one of the fresh fish selections, all of which were priced per 100kg. It was a white fish about which I was unfamiliar, I had it steamed with a light soy sauce, rice, and very nice vegetables as a side dish. Though expensive at about USD80 for the fish, I had no complaints. The beer and wine selection were quite adequate. It if went again I would probably go for one of the crab specialities. I also probably would not choose a seat that was as close to the busy walkways
5
This restaurant is on Robertson's Quay in Singapore and serves very fresh ("live") seafood done in classic Singaporean style - pepper crab, chilli crab, steamed prawns, etc. Service is rapid. Food gets to your table within a few minutes of your order. Portions are large - so if you are not hungry, this is not the place to go.A delight for seafood lovers. For many years I was a fan of the "Long Beach" seafood restaurant on East Coast Parkway - but on this trip to Singapore it was evident that it has lost the plot. And my new favorite for seafood is now the Red House.Robertson Quay is a "food street" of sorts with a variety of restaurants and bars along the river. So after a nice meal at the Red House you can stroll across to a convenient patisserie for a dessert. Hard to beat the location and the food
4
Very good food, quality and big servings. Whenever in doubt, try the small size: nobody will be upset and then you'll be able to order something else afterwards! The place is clean and good looking, very big room inside, fans and mild air conditioning (i.e. not a fridge). I had crayfish onions/ginger and it was simply delicious. Only one disturbing detail: as it was raining heavily the restaurant was rather empty, from this you can understand why the staff was very present... but it was impossible to drink more than a sip of tea without someone refilling your cup. It wasn't late (8:00pm), we tried to chat for a few minutes after dinner, but after three times you're requested if you want something else or the bill, the most logical decision was to leave the place. Shame
5
Singapore is famous for its Seafood- and No one in the whole of Singapore can compare to Red house Pepper crab ( it is every diner who has experienced pepper crab in Singapore that raves about this resturant's pepper crab) not just MeHaving had lived in Singapore for many years we had tried every restaurant possible to taste the Pepper crab and Red house came up the BEST-The reason its so good because they use Black pepper opposed to the white pepper that has a peculiar smellSunny the manager personally makes dinning in the restaurant a pleasure - The gravy of the Black pepper crab is so delicious that one does not mind the mess created eating this delicacy with every finger of both the hands!!Get the small fried bread that go with the gravyThe other dishes we enjoy is the Sea food roll-The large succlent prawns that are panfriend and topped with a salad creme sauceWhatever you order its made well & deliciousThere are 2 outlets one the original one is at East Coast Parkway UDMC Seafood place and the other in town at Robertson Quay
5
Best seafood in Singapore. During my visit in early October I ate here 3 times. Try the razor clams and the peppered crab!
5
Although it looks quite daunting due to its size,we booked and had a great dinner and time.Specialises in seafood,signature dish is chilli or black pepper crab.We had the latter which was delicious.
3
The food is good. My tip would be to order the small sizes as portions are big. The service was mixed: many people served us the various dishes whenever they were ready in the kitchen. A little more attention from the staff & I would have given the restaurant 4 out of 5.
5
The food at Red House was superb. In particular the chilli crab and black pepper crab was out of this world. The staff were attentive and helpful and packed food that we had leftover. The beer jug was not good value for money, one small glass for three people only. All in all, a great food experience to delight the taste buds.
4
Good, very fresh seafood here in a large, indoor/outdoor restaurant with huge (Big A.. - that's the brand, it's not profanity) ceiling fan. Selection of live seafood - crab: Sri Lankan or Alaskan King Crab, prawn, scallops, lobster and fish. The food is well prepared in traditional Singaporean styles and the atmosphere convivial to a large group , informal lunch or dinner.The service? Well, it's not fine dining by any stretch....but that's not why you'd come here. Having said that.... at the prices they charge, you'd expect better service I would have thought.Good for fresh seafood
4
Great location with an evening seabreeze off the water - the menu is extensive - if you choose wisely the price can be ok. Our table of five (3 adults and 2 children) enjoyed our meal - the Geo-Duck Clam Sashime tasted fine either raw or added to soup.The Chilli Crab was enormous - a tasty dish!Well recommended
5
I'm very familiar with chilli crab and black pepper crab in Singapore and there are places where crabs are too small or the condiments are too strong and cover the real taste of the crab. This restaurants is fantastic, they have very big crabs (even more than 1.5Kg) and the spices are perfectly combined. Seafood rice is also very good and bamboo clams are fresh and tasty but way too expensive (12 Sgd each). Location is perfect and in the evening you can dine outside enjoying a gentle breeze from the sea
3
Food looked impressive but was just nice not amazing, open air platstic chair place but due to closeness to the sea it captures breezes.We basically ordered 3 dishes and were presented with a $166 bill on inspection we see the pre table set up of water, hand towels, small items eg peanuts, pickles were all chargeable items even if you do not use them so be aware of that and if not wanted get them removed before charged to your bill!We walked away feeling the long taxi trip to get there was not really worth it and local hawker places we could have had similar or better food
4
Good Singapore seafood. The chili crab was good -- not too sweet like many of the place. The pepper crab was decent although could be less oily. The appetizers were just OK though. Had the combination appetizer dish -- the duck dish was a bit bland
4
We had a wide variety of sea food here. The food was excellent and the location is good...you can sit comfortably in the open.I am told that restaurants here get very crowded during the weekend, so if you really want to enjoy the food visit during the week
4
Red House Seafood is my favorite of the Singapore outlets serving chili crab & pepper crab. The freshly prepared rolls are yummy.
5
We had a fantastic time here. One of the best is "seafood combination" but others like black pepper crab ... are great too. The place you can not miss even its a bit expensive. Love to come back whenever we are in singapore
5
Great food, location and atmosphere. Not much like a locals restaurant by the people in there but very good.
3
Very busy bustling restaurant by the river. The food was great when it arrived, mine came quickly beef with ginger and spring onions. My accomanying noodles came 10 minutes later, along with the same dish for my partner, who waited another 10 minutes for his crab. Nice food spoilt by lack of co ordination from the staff. I know this sort of service is normal in these kind of restaurants and it works fine when your in a group sharing food, not when its 2 of you. Not cheap either, but what is in singapore other than taxis
5
Went there with some friends. Nice view outside the restaurant. The food was very authentic Chinese and reasonably priced. We didn't have Chili crab although it's very famous in Singapore. Instead we had the crabs cooked with ginger and spring onion because I believe that you can really taste how fresh the crabs are this way
4
Red House Seafood Restaurant serves some of the best seafood I have had. Living in Hong Kong, they have excellent seafood, but Red House beats them all. The razor clams along with chili crab & pepper crab cannot be missed. The rolls that accompany the crab is great to sop up the extra chili crab sauce. The prawns were a disappointment but everything else was unbelievable
4
Truly wonderful, authentic Singapore Chinese food. Intense colours, beguiling flavours, mesmerising aromas. Expertly served by experienced, professional staff who know how to meet their guests needs. The chili and black pepper crab dishes were to die for, I haven't had seafood this good in a long time. Hint - don't come for the ambience or surroundings - come for the food and to mix with the many locals who come here. Don't come too late!
3
Good location in East Coast famous corner to be specialized in seafood and Singaporean cuisine .We order spicy squid,cod fish teriyaky style,baby kaylang with oyster sauce,1 rice and 1 noodles.Overall everythings has good flavour and everydishes is well executed but instead give us normal noodles the service staff served lobster noodles ,we receving and we never complain but in beginner ,the directour of the place the strong reccomand this lobster in salad,many times i need say to her no thank's ......200 sing dollar for eat in food court style restaurant is too much ..is good place ,historical cuisine but i feel is abused of guests specialy if guest never request some expensive dishes...last time there
4
Went here with 2 co-workers. We ordered the black pepper and the chili crab. I liked the chili crab better because it had a hint of sweetness. I found the black pepper crab too spicy for my taste. It's fun eating out of the crab claws. We tried a few of the desserts. The black rice pudding was my favorite. Make a note that even though it's messy to eat the crab, they charge you 1.50SGD for each plate of hot napkins/ towels
3
Since we had arrived that sane day and had a meal at Maxwell Hawker Centre we were late getting to East Coast Seafood Centre for dinner. So the crab had run out. We opted for the chef's recommendation of a set meal for about SGD 70++ which included succulent asparagus, delicious razor clams, not so exciting prawns, a reasonable lobster with noodles and a competent crayfish with chilly sauce.The meal included dessert and a glass of wine.I've eaten better seafood in Singapore paying less in more upmarket restaurants.I don't see myself going there anymore considering a close to SGD 200 bill + an additional SGD 40 for taxi from and to Orchard
4
While there are many seafood restaurants at East Coast Seafood centre, Red House is one of the best with several fresh seafood available there. Their Black pepper lobsters (S$138 for a kg) were the most delicious ones apart from BBQ prawns and large succulent scallops.
3
I would stay far away from this and other restaurants in the East Coast. They are highway robbers....the lot of them. Especially when it comes to pricing the crabs and fresh fish!
5
go and try that, you won´t regret. Having a chili crab with the little bread pieces. I think they call it buns. Anyway, nice experience. Ask for the prices as there is a very big difference between Alaskan or Sri Lankan crab.
5
I lived in Singapore 8 years ago and my favourite restaurant was Red House at east coast. They now (since 4 years) opened a second outlet at Robertson quay in the city centre. I went there to eat with my family and the food was super just as I remembered it to be. Sony the waiter from 8 years ago was also still going strong. We had:Chilli crabBaby squid Baby kailang (vegetables sautÃ©ed in garlic) Prawns in cerealsBuns (sweet to suck up the sauce from the crab) Fried rice with egg and spinachWine, beer and soft drinks for childrenFood has to be 5 out of five and the same goes for service. Discuss with the waiter what you want to eat and what kind of tastes you prefer. They can really help you to get the meal you like and in the right portions. Do not take a crab smaller than 1.5 KG because it is difficult to access all the good meat in smaller crabs. Preferably if you are 4 adults you should order two crabs of 2KG each, one black pepper and one chilli. If in Singapore do not miss this place
4
Very good, although getting very pricey (along with the rest of Singapore). Silly not to have the chilli crab when here. Pepper crab also good, but chilli crab better. Smokers outside can be a pain, as the smoke drifts into the main (openair) restaurant. Seating outside is nicest, but high chance you will be next to a table of puffing smokers, which spoils it somewhat

We love the Black Pepper crab at Red House. We were in Singapore for one night, we wanted crab, it was just as good as we remembered and worth every cent.Crab in Singapore has to be one of the most essential global travel experiences and Red House deliver a greet place to enjoy it.There may be better... and there are certainly cheaper crabs in Singapore, but we will come back to Red House

There are several Red House restaurants but we ate at the restaurant located in the East Coast Park. We were a fairly large party so we were split into 2 large round tables that the restaurant was happy to push close together. The food was off-the-charts EXCELLENT. We had Cereal Shrimp, Chili and Black Pepper Crabs, their special bread balls which are not to be missed. One dish completely surprised me. We ordered "crayfish" and were served something that looked, and more importantly, tasted like lobster tail. There is almost no way to avoid overeating as the food is clearly special and not something that most people will find in their neighborhoods back home. The setting is very casual but the food is anything but. Enjoy!

I had dinner at Red House Seafood (60 Robertson Quay) on 8 Dec 2011 with a group of 10 colleagues and it was fabulous! We had a huge round table over looking the water - Robertson Quay is a more quiet, residential style area - away from the maddening crowds of Clarke Quay and Boat Quay and I really enjoyed the peace and quiet there. Just note that that Robertson Quay does not have the same great city views etc that Clarke Quay and Boat Quay have - this may be a consideration etc - it over looks the water but a quiet stretch of the river.This is not a fancy or elegant restaurant - it reminds me of a huge upmarket cafeteria - but food was superb. We let one of the "locals" in our group order for us - I loved dipping the fried buns into the chilli sauce nearly as much as the crab itself! Likewise with the pepper crab. Make sure you order the fried or steamed buns with your crab! What a treat! The scallops and broccoli was great as was the duck dish. The deep fried prawns and calamari also excellent.I can definitely say this was my best meal of my 5 nights in Singapore - and it only took 15 mins to walk along the waterfront back to the Swissotel Merchant Court

Wine was advertised on the table at a cheaper price than on the menu - so obviously we requested that. The bill gave the price as on the menu. The staff were apologetic for the mistake but insisted we pay the higher price even though the error was clearly theirs.Very busy and over priced - you pay for the locatio

I was looking forward to stopping at this restaurant since I've been here now a few times and have ejoyed it in the past. We ordered the cereal prawns, butter prawns, bee hoon and duck. The crispy duck was great, if not slightly dry but crispy to the name and the noodles (bee hoon) were not that bad. They were advertised withseafood noodles, but not much seafood! I only saw 2 small shrimps and 2 pieces of calamari in it - dissapointing! The cereal prawns were small and dry (ordered 400gr look like 250gm) and the butter prawns were tastless and slightly cold. (We arrived late in the night and they were not so busy) You should also BE AWARE of the hidden charges - like the marinated peanuts and hot tea AND hand wipes that are automatically put on your table - they are NOT complimentary. Because of this, and the cost as well (the above food + drinks (2 x S$12 beer!) came to OVER S$150 I will not be returning or recommending this restaurant again

they seated us near a garbage trolley that we had to ask to remove. we asked about the portions size for the set menu and they assured they were normal portions, still we went away hungry. lobster noodles quality was the same as instant noodle.

Had a fantastic seafood meal at Robertson Quay. Still craving it. Want to go back to Singapore just for some more of that yummy Chilli Crab!

the restaurant is located in the riverside.. nice location to walk around in this area. the restaurant is fine, usually crowded .. the layout and interiors are good. service is good as in any other good hotel.serves Chinese menu. Food will be good, if you chose the right dish. being an Indian it was difficult for me to chose the food, but my colleagues in Singapore helped... we had some prawns and seafood fried rice .. it was nice ..Nothing great about this place ... same like any other decent restaurants in Singapore

We went here for dinner without booking and had to sit inside, but ceiling fans keep it cool. Seating outside more picturesque. Large to small servings cater for singles/cours to large family/friends groups. Our waiter recommended a scallop/ squid dish with Chilli and it was to die for. Our other dishes were also delicious. Reasonably priced for seafood freshly cooked. Highly recommended seafood restaurant at Robertson Quay branch

This restaurant used to be our favourite. It has been sometime since we last had seafood since not having enough numbers.We had a visiting from from Japan, and decided to host her seafood at Red House. We ordered : Drunken prawns (300 g), which came in measly sizes and we weren't even shown that it was live.We ordered 2 (1kg) Sri Lankan crabs in two different style (pepper and chill). Again, both crabs came is miserable size and were not fresh! The flesh of the crab was powderery. I would not go further except to say that we paid for our food which amount to S$205, and feeling very dissatisfied, we went to the No-Signboard next door to start over.Standard has dropped big time, which is now apparent with the empty tables which was previously filled with queues

This may have been a good place to eat in the past but not now. I had one beer, my wife a fruit juice - Crispy skin duck (which was a great dish), butter prawns that were bland and tasteless and 'special seafood fried rice' no seafood but traces of carrot visible - bland would be an overstatement - the bill $115 - they even charged for the towels - look elsewhere we are

The restaurant was not up front in its charges. They set down peanuts and serve you hot tea but don't tell you there is a cost for them. Also 12 Sing Dollars for a draft beer is highway robbery especially for local Tiger Beer. Go somewhere else for your Chili Crabs

I like the Red House Seafood place right on the river in Singapore. I came by on a Sunday night after having returned my rented bike next door. I felt Red House is a very inviting and including restaurant. Travelling by myself this time, I opted for the classic Singapore noodles and was amazed of how such a simple meal could taste like heaven. Compliments to the chef. I enjeyed the atmosphere of the place tremendously and its location next to the river is very beautiful. When I come back to Singapore with my fiance we are gonna have the chili crab at the Red House - it looked great. Thank you for a great meal at an affordable price

I ordered a 70 dollars red wine here. However, a waiter came to me to told me that the wine was 180 dollars. I felt very fishy when a waiter came back to me to ask "if this is the wine you ordered?". So I asked how much it is and the waiter replied it is 70 dollars. But another waiter came back to me that was really was 180 dollars. I have nevere been cheated with any other restaurant in Singapore but this one is really different when I first used this for the first place.So if you really want to not cheated it is safer to try Jumbo or Long beach where I have never been cheated after many uses. Never try to be cheated with Red House!!!

We had a splendid night out at the Red House. We had 4 dishes... Chili crab, seafood fried rice, tofu and brocolli and Sake Teriyaki Fish... the dishes were all fantastic and large! I'll defintely go back - and the service was good albeit our waiter wasn't up to telling us much details about each dish

Red House in Roberson Quay is our favorite place for local food! The pepper crab, chili crab & vegetables are consistantly wonderful. The service is always reliable!

realy nice seafood - restaurant ( ok, its like a kiosk ), for good price (you are in Singapore), but for this City its one of the best food. We had a nice varity of all kind of seafood , including the chilly crab, which is a must here. We had a lot of different kind of seafood and all of them was really excellent,the athmoshpere and the sourrounding is like on the karneval, open restaurant and you can either sit inside (rain protected) or outside

What more can I say - the title says it all. I have loved this restaurant since the first time I went there, which must have been around 1997. Went there probably 50 or more times until I left Singapore in 2002. Went there with family and friends many times. Other times, just ordered the chilli cran take-away and took it home.The chilli crab is supurb - you must order it with plenty of fried buns to soak up the sauce. Also amongst my favourites there are the steamed garlic prawns. Have had many other things there over the years - butter crab, black pepper crab, drunken prawns, fried baby squid, kangkong, baby kailan, bamboo shoots with some other type of seafood inside. The list is endless. My company took me here for my farewell dinner, and all of my colleagues who were either Singaporean or Malaysian also loved the food.Have been back many times while passing through Singapore on business or on holidays in the past 8 years. Old friends are often more than happy to take me there.So, this would be not only my favourite restaurant in Singapore, but favourite in the world!!!! And that's not exaggerating.The prices are now a bit steep - if you compare it to say the prices of a seafood restaurant in the void deck of a HDB block. But that is to be expceted, given the location. Last time I went there, in jan 2010, they offered I think a 20% discount, as we were there quite early (before 6pm I think). This may only apply on certain weeknights though.The views and sea breezes from this area (the entire seafood centre in fact) are quite good, especially at night

We ate at the Robertson Walk Red House Restaurant on our first night in Singapore and every other restaurant we went to after that was evaluated against the fantastic meal we had here. It was not cheap but it was worth it – still not expensive like Sydney Restaurants – after tax and the service charge it was $160 Singaporean dollars.We had BBQ’d squid, jelly cuttlefish, chilli crab (we could not eat it all and took it with us for dinner the next night), my son had half a duck plus 4 beers and 2 cokes. We would definitely go back. The Robertson Walk area is full of great restaurants -5 minutes walk from Clarke Quay.One thing to be aware of when you eat at a restaurant in Singapore is the dishes they give you as you sit down are not free, neither are tea or towels and they automatically add a 10% service charge. I will put up with that though for the great foo

This restaurant is not far from the airport. Better to catch a cab. You have to try the Chille Crab if your in Singapore and best place would be the red House. We loved it. For 2 adults it cost us with drinks SGD50.00. Worth it
