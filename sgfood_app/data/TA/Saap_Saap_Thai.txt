Visited the branch at Tampines hub and really enjoyed the garlic beef rice. The beef was juicy and tender while the glass noodle had just the right amount of spiciness. A delicious experience overall. üëç

I ordered the boat noodle deluxe. It was delicious with generous serving of beef slices, meat balls and tendon. The soup was robust! Good value at $9.90.

Halal Thai food that is quite affordable. Good variety, from drinks to dessert. Average $10 per pax. The tom yam and basil chicken are very spicy. Good to have Thai Green milk tea to cool you down.

It‚Äôs pretty decent if you want a quick Thai fix. Ambience is okay, except that the place can get a little cramp when there‚Äôs a crowd. Food preparation time took less than ten minutes and the food were quite fresh, except that the soup could be served a little hotter. And I think they‚Äôve pre-cooked some of the food so it‚Äôs jut like scoop-and-serve. The portion is also average, good for small eaters but if you‚Äôve got a big appetite then maybe say 3 dishes for 2 people? The deserts were average, and yet again, portion was small. Mango sticky rice was nothing to shout about and would be great if they had a wider variety. Overall, nothing too fantastic but a good place to gather some friends once in a while when local food gets boring.

The rice dish portions were very small and the beef was chewy and hard cartilage. The green chicken curry was tastless and very small portion for $8.50!! Looks like they just microwaved a lump of meat to defrost it and then threw in the gravy or stir-fried it. Tasteless, chewy and expensive food. Definitely not authentic Thai food !

Hits and misses. The boat noodles with Australian beef was generous and smooth, Tom yam had lotsa seafood like squid, prawns,crabstick, fish etc just a tad watery soup. Pad Thai was a definite disaster though, tasted like baby food and was all crumpy and tasteless. Milk tea was not ba

This Thai eatery will always be crowded during lunch and dinner time. You will have to queue up at the counter to order food first though. Varieties are a lot and it is halal so our Muslim friends can enjoy Thai food too. The price is a bit expensive for the small portion of food, the serving is quite fast. I have ordered the fried chicken rice, the chicken is crispy and fried with Thai herbs, delicious. I have ordered a Thai milk tea too, too bad the drinks are ready so they cannot adjust the sugar level for you. Highly recommended to try

One of the many Thai eateries in Singapore. Though self service, the counter staff were friendly and patience with the customer in ordering their food and even provided Recommendation. I had a fabulous lunch there. Food was yummy. The drink was sweet to overcome my level of spiciness. Partly cause I was greedy to add in too much chili flakes tat mades the soup based noodles spicy. Though spicy, it was delicious.Saw many were enjoying the mango glutinous rice
