Went here for lunch and it was absolutely lovely. The food was really nice and well as the drinks. Everything is quite reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly.
5
Try the lunch set that is very worthwhile. Twenty five a set that includes starter, main, dessert and a coffee
5
Nice ambience with good food and reasonably priced drinks. Wonderful place to unwind at the end of a Long day.
3
The ambiance was nice enough, but the food leaves much to be desired. Presentation and taste were very average.
5
Price is fairly high, but pizza is good! Love their truffle mushroom pizza, aromatic truffle with cheesey topping.
5
Special request out of the menu and the chef make it for us. Thumb up!!
Helpful staffs as well... =)

Lovely afternoon at the bistrobar. Laze your time away and dig into the yummy pasta. And leave very satisfied!
4
First time to this restaurant, and the ambiance is relatively pleasant. We took the indoor seats, however we think outdoor seats would not be a bad choice either. Our meals were served promptly, and service crew were very responsive.
3
Located in Rochester park, itâ€™s a pleasant quiet place to eat. The service is friendly. But the food is a disappointment: almost no dressing in the salad, and a very blend risotto with 3 mini slipper lobster. Not to mention that portions are very small (rice is not that expensive!!) and that I felt hungry after my lunch. Too bad as I had a better experience in that place 2 years ago..
3
This was a repeat visit where I ordered the exact same dishes. While it was not as good as the first time around, it was still very decent.Biggest niggle was that they served chips / fires which had obviously been cooked much earlier on and has the consistency of cardboard. If McD's can serve fresh fries for $5, I'm sure Da Paolo can serve fresh fries for $3
4
Love the set up and especially the alfresco area. Pizzas and pastas were all enjoyable!would definitely come back again
1
Just awful. Used to be good, then I guess they changed management. Bad food, worse service. Only good for the drinks deals... but there are other places for that, and where you don’t feel like you’re doing the owners a service by just turning up...
5
Excellent setting with sufficient ventilation. Food is excellent for both presentation and taste. Wine choices available were good, with a nice range in terms of pricing choices. Amazing service topped off a wonderful night.
5
Environment is great and staffs are friendly. The only downside is the toilet reeks of urine smell... Eeewwwwww... Truffle Fries is good but forget about the Buffalo Wings. Overall a very nice evening spent there.
5
romanti ambience.. very attentive staff.. awesome food.. great for group gathering and couples.. has one of the best pizza and squid ink pasta
5
Service is great, food is really good but don't bother to go for the desserts... super tiny portions and overly priced.
4
Quiet restaurant in Rochester with great pastas. Price might be a little steep, but made affordable with the entertainer app.
2
Came with my wife and 10 year old son. The envionment was lovely in the midst of trees. The pastas, one with crab and one with squid ink were pretty good. Pizza was good for a restaurant. But the lava cake was dry and chocolate without flavour. Worst lava cake j have ever had
3
Nice location and pleasant setting. Pleasant staff and service. Starters were very good, but let down by the main courses which had been sat waiting for us to finish our starters. Overall a good meal and a good choice for pre-theatre (Star) dinner and drinks. The place was full of ex-pats with the same intention and probably better than most on offer at BV food halls
5
Enjoyed lunch with friend. Quiet and rustic open air dining. Set lunch is about $25++, comes with soup or salad, main course, dessert and coffee or tea. Excellent environment to catch up with friends over lunch or just to have a break from a hectic day.
5
Prompt service. Nice alfresco dining space. Always excellent pizza and pasta. Comfort food. Great place to chit chat the night away!
5
We had dinner there. The atmosphere was very chill. Food and wine were very nice. And service was also very good.
3
Good ambience. But the pasta was slightly overcooked and the dessert was underwhelming. Compared to the Da Paolo Gastronomia, the food is a far cry. Furthermore, The Da Paolo BistroBar is more pricey than Gastronomia.
5
good service delicious food ，enjoy the good time with my wife.and chop make it easy to book the table
5
Yummy pasta! Love them to bites! Come here and u will have a fantastic time, so will your tummy! And your friends!
2
Supposed to be home made but actually is a frozen industrial dessert from the Picard French brant... not bad but...
3
I met a Friend for a late lunch here. The service was very good and attentive, the flavour of the food was tasty. I ordered the chicken which was $32++ and received a succulent 1/2 chicken however it only came with 7 small pieces of potatoes. Again these were well flavoured but I was still hungry after my meal which for the price I did not expect.
4
Went to this restaurant for lunch with colleagues and they created a table of 8 pax indoor for us. I've ordered Tagliatelle Al Granchio which is home made pasta with crabmeat and tomatoes and cream. Pasta has very nice texture but I find the sauce a little too creamy for my taste. The baby back rib was good and loved the garlic potatoes wedges. Good place for people to hang out for good meal and nice place to chill out
4
Never thought there's such a lovely restaurant just close to office of Metropolis! Cross the road, enter into this green area with a white house. Sunshine through the roof glass and the funs just brought a perfect lunch feel. I love the pasta with spicy tomato sauce... An enjoyable experience out of routine food choice in Buona Vista.
4
We held a dinner function for about 16 people at the restaurant. The ambiance was wonderful, with a colonial feel to the place. Both food and wine was great, and the service was impeccable too. The price was a bit on the high side, otherwise I would have given it a perfect rating
4
Went here with colleagues from work this week, atmosphere was great ,food was excellent, varying from sea bass, mushroom rosito, steak , staff were very attentive , will be back
5
Had the crab meat pasta and grilled chicken. Both dishes were great, portions were on the smaller side. Also had a Brownie with chocolate sauce which was awesome as well!
Service is also personal. Will revisit!
5
Good food and great service although we did not order plenty of dishes.. Look forward to my next visit..
5
This place never fails to live up to my expectations. The food is great as always, the ambience is perfect as always, and the food is just as pricey as always. ;)
I've always enjoyed coming here, and this visit was no different.
4
I had the slipper lobster spsgetti which was good while my guest had the set lunch which was good value.
5
I booked this restaurant at the last minute via Hungrygowhere & had indicated that it was my friend's birthday & ask for suggestions. No one replied me & i presumed nothing special been arranged. To my surprise, they gave a a tiramisu with a 'Happy Birthday' msg written & said that it was on the house. I really loved this place with the nice relaxing ambience & the food WERE superlicious ! The staffs there were smily and it really make our day after our tiring stressful week. Thumbs up to you all who served us as well as the other guests. Will definitely come back again.
4
We went there for the set lunch on a Wednesday. The service staff was attentive and they do check in with us from time to time. I would highly recommend the set lunches as they do come with good portions and varieties. The tiramisu definitely matched the ravings given by the service crew. Will definitely go back there
4
This restaurant has great ambiance - white low lit lights, candles, and sometimes on the weekends (when I've been) they have acoustic bands. They also have the best pizza I've had in Singapore in the two years I've been here! However, the server would only talk to my husband, and barely acknowledged my presence. It was kind of annoying. But I'll still be back, whether they want to talk to me or not :
4
We were much earlier than the resevered timing and had settled at the bar first. We were served complimentary beef sliders. Really juicy and tender! Dinner was pork ribs and burger which was another hit! Cocktail selection could be more varied though. Overall we had a great time 
4
The most spacious Da Paolo branch of the lot, I prefer its alfresco large setting here compared to its branch at Holland Village. More importantly is the service of the chefs - they cook from the heart! And it shows through their impeccable service and love for food. No words need to say more.
5
Nice food and lovely atmosphere! ;) will definitely visit again! Highly recommended, love the beer! :)
5
There was a clown at the place, which made it so wonderful and exciting. totally made our day! food was also great, but can get a little hot in afternoons
5
Fantastic food, as always, service not pushy, so no need to hurry. Good choice of drinks, pricing a bit on high side, though
3
Went for a business dinner with a pretty large group. Service was slow, with drinks taking more than 20 minutes to be delivered, even though the restaurant was only 1/3 full. It was a long wait to get more drinks later. Food was well cooked and presented but nothing to write home about. This is not the cheapest place so you would expect great food, drinks and service across the board, which was not the case. I will not avoid it for a business meal in the future, but I would not recommend it.
3
This place is a stone's throw away from Buona Vista MRT with plenty of parking around the area. They have free parking at their premises but the lots are limited.We arrived early and was shown our reserved seats. While waiting for 4 other friends to arrive, the staff attending to our table took our orders promptly and with a smile.The first thing we noticed was that the food prices are very steep. The only good deals were the Happy Hour for drinks (1 for 1) that lasted until 7:30pm, and there is an ongoing promotion of 15% off for HSBC credit cards.We were given the impression by one of the more experienced staff, probably the owner, that we could get one set of drinks out before 7:30pm and another set when we are done. However, another staff came along and said that both drinks must be out before 7:30pm, to our great dismay, and he promptly served both sets on the dot at 7:30pm. Two of our friends, however, managed to keep one set of drinks until after they had finished theirs as they were served by another staff.We ordered a spread of pasta, pizza and salad. While the food was above average, there were no dishes that would make us want to come back again for.The ambience felt peaceful (would have been quieter if not for a celebration going on at the next table), but do beware of mosquitoes should you choose to sit outdoors. We requested for a mosquito coil to be placed under our table, and the staff had to proclaim loudly that they would not be held responsible for any injuries should there be a fire from the coil.We would have expected consistent service given the steep prices, but as the night unfolds the staff serving us became inattentive to the point that my cup of water was topped up to only a fifth. The staff never returned after pouring all the water from his flask.There are other bistros and bars that offers better service at a more affordable price point. We would not return.

Da Paolo Bistro Bar located at 3 Rochester Park, Rochester Park, nestled in an old black & white house. Been familiar, and accustomed with their other excellent outlets, I must confess that this outlet lived up to their exceptional delicious food cuisine. The dÃ©cor in itself, is very pleasing & attractive, tables were situated with ample space, and the staff were attentive. All the food that we tried, especially the signature Crabmeat & homemade tagliatelle was to die for, portion size was spot on & the freshness & taste not far behind. For dessert we indulged with their famous signature tiramisu. The menu was great & it was hard to narrow down my selection. Staff were attentive & the food was delicious. Some of the tastiest Italian I've had & it didn't break the bank. Good service, lovely staff and nice ambience. Looks and feels a little like fine dining but the price is affordable. The food was awesome. Everything we tried was great. Will definitely come back again
4
I visited this place for dinner using the most valuable 50% off promotion via Eatigo app. We had Crabmeat pasta, which was delicious and my personal favourite, and tried Mac & Cheese Pizza (thin crust) with Burratina Cheese as appetizer. We topped if off with brownie for dessert, that had nutella sauce poured over it on a sizzling plate. The service crew was nice and polite in asking permission before he poured the sauce. This is a good moment for taking a video, but the lighting isn't too good. The price ranges from $20-40 on average for the mains. Dessert price ranged from $16-20.The bar has a nice ambience but i got bitten quite badly by the mosquitoes, because they have yet to burn the mosquito coils. Fortunately, they provide mosquito repellent on request, before it could get any worse for me

I visited this restaurant with a colleague whilst on a business trip to Singapore. We had not booked but shown to a table on the edge of the forest park the restaurant is located in. Service was excellent from the start , drinks ordered taken and Mimosa was excellent . Food all cooked in open plan kitchen and came fairly quickly after orderI had garlic chicken very good with chips vegetables all very good. Deserts were excellent very good cheesecake . Service good all evening . Very nice bar area if you just fancy a drink. Would for sure eat here again
4
Pretty decent food that was slightly pricey (probably due to the ambience with live band on a sat night). Wasn't overly crowded and i like how the space between tables were sufficiently spread out for privacy. Service can be a tad slow though given the number of waiters. But overall, Nice place for a date night!

Today we were quite disappointed with the rude attitude that the staff showed in the restaurant. The bar was packed so we sat on a table in the restaurant side. One of our friends was not feeling well and requested a drink that had whiskey, lime, ginger and HOT water. After a while we were rushed with the bill as they said the restaurant was closed. We were NOT asked for it nor if we wanted anything else as a last order at any point. We asked if we can have another round and they said that there was NO HOT WATER, as the kitchen was closed and the coffee machine was turned off. We asked if the could just get the hot water to which they refused arguing the same excuse. Just HOT WATER!! We were not asking for anything else. We didn't want to argue and ask for the bill which took ages to arrive as they didn't included something. We pay and right after they collected the money the turn the lights up in a clear and rude attitude of kicking us out of the place. We requested that while we were getting ready to leave but the manager and the waiter started arguing back to us when we were telling them the lousy attitude they were displaying. How could they!!Good thing is that just opposite by The hotel we went to sixty40 where we were treated nicely and courteously. Shame on Da Paolo!!If a nice place like this cannot hire the staff that has to be at the level this place is supposed to be, it isn't worth going back anytime soon! What a pity
4
If you are looking for a good business lunch look no further. a great menu and no fuss service will leave you time to get back to your office. The food is good as well. Enjoy.
3
Went as we live nearby. Nice atmosphere but the food was too salty for my taste :( also I felt the menu were more suitable for colder weather...
4
food was good.. wait staff are very attentive.. good for gathering and for couples.. would definitely go back again!
4
My partner and I love the ambiance. Not too crowded on a Thursday night and loving the food. Not too expensive from my point of view.
4
Not my first time here. Love the food and al fresco dining. Service is great as well! Will definitely be back
5
Another great group dinner. As always the food and service are very good. Great place for a group dinner or quiet romantic dinner. Nice bar area and the whole experience brings in the outdoors nicely.
4
Went there for Valentines' dinner. We love the pasta and the rastaurant atmosphere, cozy and chillax. Pizza is ok not the best though.
4
the setting sets this place apart. it is surrounded by trees which gives it a very nice ambience. the place is generally quiet and therefore very conducive for a business lunch. besides the restaurant, there is also a bar. will be nice to visit for evening drinks chill-out. Food is good and so is the service staff.
4
With outside seating and a party of eight we enjoyed a relaxed evening with Da Paolo's limited, but delicious menu. I ordered their salami and chilli pizza and was not disappointed. Everyone in the party left nothing on their plates as well. I was not, however, impressed with the Calamari appetizer. A few beers in bottle and tap available, and much more wine choices. Service was very attentive and answered all of our questions while reviewing their menu
4
This is a good getaway from the city, tranquil, good food and bar areas.The crab meat linguine is my favourite!Three items cost us SGD101. I would say this is quite a good deal for a lovely atmosphere. Service staff members were friendly and willing to show us aroun
5
Wonderful place and atmosphere, with great food too! The staff service were excellent as well. Cheers!
5
Great ambiance and atmosphere. Good for couple and groups. The environment was very cosy and comfortable. Service staff are friendly and efficient.
4
squid ink pasta is a must try! wait staff is very attentive.. ambiance is very romantic and excellent for couples..
4
Al fresco seating here's awesome as long as its not a blazing hot afternoon. Made better with 1 for 1 with the entertainer! Will definitely be coming back here soon
4
This restaurant has an attached garden bar, both are quiet and nice for a relaxed evening. Food is very good and service is usually very good also. Good for small groups.
4
Had dinner & drinks with a group of friends. Chill ambient and good food. Thought it was pack, somehow the open concept enabled the place to be not too noisy and we had a great time talking.Happy Hours on weekday 12 - 2.30pm, 5.30 - 7.30pm.
5
The food was good but the service are even better then the food and the monitor was a killer the service staff with the tattoos was so attentive to our needs and I don't even need to ask them what I need... I have a great time and I will come bac
3
Somehow went here as our fav Italian at Rochester was closed, it was a mistake. I opted for set lunch and Crab soup was ok but very bland. Pasta came Under-cooked and when we asked to get it properly done, they simply microwaved and sent back the plate. Portion size was small and Prive not worth. My colleague ordered ham with Fetta cheese and salad and he got a big tomato in his plate, being European he was quite disappointed, he complained to staff but no response . I asked for pepper a few times and staff forgot each time , food was pretty bland.Overall not worth, but yes Tiramasu cake was excellent
5
Food was above average; not the best you can get, but above average; the ambience and the attentiveness of the staff was good, as was their discreetness.The fact that we were there at 9pm may have helped, since we probably missed the larger dinner crowd and hence have a better staff-to-patron ratio
4
Atmosphere was great, especially outdoor. They had more outdoor seatings than indoor. If you need indoor seating, be sure to reserve in advance. It was a birthday dinner for me, and everything went pretty well. The servers were friendly and polite, and were quick to change one of the main course that we ordered when the wrong main arrive. The price of the mains were very affordable, however I do feel that the price of the starters could have been better. A plate of calamari was $24 for less than 20pcs. Didn't think that was worth the price though it was still quite delicious. Their mushroom and truffle pizza is still one of my favorite, together with their mushroom risotto!
5
Food was not bad, love the ambience. Used entertainer one for one for great deal on the main courses!
4
Had a nice and cosy post Christmas lunch with a friend. Service was good and they placed us in a quiet corner. Food was tasty.
5
Love the food! Ambience was great! Problem was the car park. Limited parking and the slope was extremely steep. So other than accessibility, we really love that place!
5
Good food, the grilled beef tenderloin was hotel standard worthy or even better! Outdoor dining can be a bit hot after walking over from bv mrt, so request for indoor seating if you mind the heat
4
Love this place! Amazing bar and atmosphere. We ordered some bar food as we had already made reservations for dinner elsewhere but the portions were quite large and very filling! Good cocktail list and the service is ever obliging.
4
Went there twice during the Christmas week. Was exceptionally value for money as we applied the Mastercard Buy 1 Get 1 Free promotion on their Pizzas and Pasta dishes. However, with just 3 drinks and 2 desserts (Tiramisu and molten lava cake) came up to over SGD60. A tad expensive.First time with my colleagues on 22 Dec, we were on a Christmas lunch celebration- we waited for min 40 minutes before they served us food. My colleague requested for some bread to fill our stomach as we were having a bottle of wine...Service staff were friendly and nice on both occasions. Not exceptional but definitely better than most places.The place is lovely. Away from the usual buzz.Pasta-Vongole was the best.The rest were a tad too salty- Lobster, crabment, eggplant pastas.Pizzas-All good! All guests were impressed Loved the parma ham and wild rocket pizza
2
Had been a Da Paolo since their very early days at Tanjong Pagar, and had patronized Da Paolo at Rochester many times before - but today's meal, a lunch send-off for a colleague, was one of the worse restaurant experience in a long while. Their $25 set lunch looked attractive enough for our party of 9 - head waiter said that he soup was a lobster bisque, with either rib-eye grilled or a crab meat pasta, and dessert with coffee/tea. I was skeptical that DP could serve a good rib-eye for a $25 set, so only my vegetarian colleague and I ordered something else but the others went for the beef. Then came back the head waiter that there wasn't any more bisque - we were seat before noon! - and potato soup was on offer - it came watery but ok if only we were all served at the same time - a few of us had to wait 5 min or more... then the mains came - it was tough, sinewy and 2 did not get served until we raised the issue - apparently their order was missed. Almost after we had all finished, their's came. It wasn't a particularly full today - besides us, maybe 6-7 more tables of 2-4 folks for a team of 4-5 wait-staff isn't overly demanding - bottleneck probably at the kitchen. Overall too cheap to be good - hope this is not Da Paolo going down-market and the quality with it
3
People appear to give very positive reviews for this place. Our experience was mixed. We went for lunch. We had a reservation for Indoor seating. On arrival 10 min early, we were told indoors was full. I said I had made an email reservation. Very quick reply back was that others reserved earlier. But I had telephoned to confirm, and no one told me that I couldn't get the indoor table. It's not so much that there was a mix up, but rather the glib reply! They had quite a crowd and we had to wait a very long time for our main courses....45 minutes perhaps? The waiter attending to us was cheerful although he could be better trained. Food was quite good. Soup was a little salty. Very good Tiramisu. But not sure if I'd return.
4
We were a party of 6 and everyOne enjoyed their food. I had the spaghetti agliolio with mushroom, very tasty; and loved the truffle mushroom pizza w mascarpone (am vegetarian so I asked for no mozzarella) it was delicious. For dessert the lava cake is a must for chocolate lovers, and the tiramisu is very good too. My boyfriend said his babyback ribs were excellent-tender, juicy and tasty.Service excellen
4
Just visited the restaurant with Friend from oversea . Impressive ambience only setback is outdoor! We are lucky it just after a rain fall hence is not too hot. Also as it's outdoor sitting hence you will breath in second hand cigarette smell at the same time! Food overall is quite good but slightly on the salty side
5
Decided to try out this place since having the Entertainer 1-for-1 promotion. Great services and ambient. It's is semi fine dining style. The food is nice. Perfect place for couple, family or event a group gathering
4
It is a nice al fresco dinning experience. Food is well prepared and pizzas are great. However I feel it is a bit expensive.
5
Visited the restaurant with my husband for the first time. Amazing food and staffs. Very friendly staffs. Jack recommended amzaing food and Bartender Boon recommended a nice cocktail. Pleasant welcome by the hostess team. I will come back again
4
Always a pleasant experience. They are really good with kids! The kids corner was a pleasant surprise this trip. The restaurant is very patient with kids.
4
Was nearby so dropped by to try this place on a Sunday. As expected there was no need to make a reservation but the place was pretty much full. Mainly family with kids and groups of friend having their weekend banter.Ambience. The place is well decorated, clean, cool with good greenery. In summary the place was really nice and definitely a somewhere to come on a lazy Sunday to have a good relaxing meal with friends and family.Foodwise.For starters, we had the calamari and tuna tartar. Both were pretty ok especially the tuna tatare. Main courses was the Braised Beef Cheek, Ribs and the still available Breakfast section - Eggs with Avocado and Kale. All were cooked well, nothing truly exception as dishes but tastey enough to recommend as dishes to try.Desserts. We had the Tiramisu and the Lava Cake. Both are central kitchen items and heated up here so not a place to travel great distances to just to eat this. Service. I can say they are amply staffed and the waiting crew was polite with exception of a glum faced server who brought the food ( maybe she was having a bad day... ha ha). This good service however we felt was being slowed down or being held up by the kitchen as food took sometime to come out and we experienced a "blip" on serving timing on the mains - one came when we had already almost finished the others . ... so there is room for improvement. Price. This is not the cheapest place around so be prepared to pay for the ambience, service and food.... For me 4 thumbs up out of 5 is well deserved !
4
Good cocktails- Plum and Gin ( locally delicious )Love the simplicity yet satisfying dishes going well with lovely Italian wines.I like chilling out with friends, bottle of wine, a couple of cocktails and bar bites like cheeses at the bar.The service crew has been extremely helpful and kind. Thank you for making our Tuesday night a lovely one
4
Having been at other branches of Da Paolo, we decided to go for some drinks at the Rochester park branch. The location is close to buona vista mrt, and located within the lush greenery of rochester park. They have two seperate place one for drinks and bar food and the other one foor food order. The ambience is rather chillax with some breeze if one is lucky. The drink menu is quite complete with various wine and beer selection. However if you sit in the bar area one can only order pizza. We tried the various pizza selections; including the four cheese, the ham and rockets, the salami and vegeterian pizza. The crust is well prepared and very fresh. The quality was fine and nothing to complain about but only the service. The service was good but unfortunately we were served not all the same time which made some friends to wait for the rest of the pizzas which ended up in some people eating the not so warm pizzas. If that could be improved it would be a great experience. Price wise on average one can expect to spend around 55$ with ab alcoholic drink and taxes. So if you are going for good food in good place you should definitely try this place
4
Never knew that there is Da Paolo at One Rochester.The place is quite huge. There is a bar with ranges of alcoholic drinks in one corner , beautiful big open kitchen and seating spaces.Love the ambiance at night, & the food is superb! So delicious.We ordered two types of pizza, crab pasta and grilled chicken.All are nice though the grilled chcken and pasta portion is a little bit small
3
We came all the way from orchard road at our normal stay at Shangri-La in cab and am afraid ,we were not that impressed !Singapore has so many good Eateries to go to and each and everyone ,very different .Out there is the competition but this one is not one that I will rushed back too soon.Having said that its ok but a bit of a ripped -off for value .We arrived n had our drinks in the bar area n then onto tables n we all had Spanish rack of ribs and one other had chicken.Good ok and I also ordered a lobster n avocado salad as starter! Only found about three tiny pieces of lobster n two pieces of avocado and$23 for that.It was covered with a lot of lettuce but no lobster to be found but only the three small bits!!The service was good n staff ,polite and when asked to question about lobster salad,he did so n we got it taken off our bill after!!!Result..!We ordered two of the red n two wine!Bill comes out to nearly $700 !!So ,not worth it as there are a lot that can compete better
3
Food is quite average to me, the portion is not big enough. I requested for indoor seat through chope but when I went there, the staff said didn't receive my reservation and was told indoor seats are full. During the lunch session, I don't see the indoor seats fully taken.
3
Requested for indoor seating but was given an outdoor. They didn't even call to inform. Music was too loud and it makes it hard to communicate. Food was On a high side and not really worth the value.
2
There was a children's party going on which we were not informed of so lots of very small kids running around. Very very noisy.
5
We had the 2nd floor to ourselves because everyone wanted the outdoor seats. Service was excellent. No complaints!
5
Had a great experience at the restaurant.
Staff were friendly and food was great!
Will definitely go back again!
5
Great place, wonderfull barman, great margharitas, great italian food ! Can smoke in the outside bar (of course not in restaurant).
5
We came here during our wedding anniversary
This gives us a relaxing, laid back atmosphere with good italian, country style. Highly recommended place to wind-down and cool in the area.
4
Been here 5 times and each time it didn't fail to please. Food is great and well presented. We had burger, pizzas and pastas. Creme Brulee and Lava Molten chocolate cake are our favourite desserts. Service is attentive. Lovely ambience sitting outdoors with lush greenery. On the pricey side though
4
Had the set lunch with a friend at Da Paolo Bistro Bar. We had four choices to select from, with choice of soup or salad, main course (chicken parmigiana, penne bolognese, grilled seabass or mushroom spaghetti aglio olio) and tiramisu for dessert. The food was well-prepared, but I didn't like the way that it was plated, with the appetiser and main course all on a single plate (with 4 sections for the soup, bread, oil & vinegar, main course)! It made the main course portion look small too. Hope the management can review this and go back to serving appetisers alone first, then main course after. The tiramisu was lovely; creamy and moist with nice flavours of coffee and mascarpone cheese.
5
Been here lots of times. Food always really good, but the fish and chips is legendary. Can't really taste the red bull in the batter, but then can't taste beer in beer batter either. The sea bass fish is cooked to perfection in light crispy batter accompanied with a slightly spicy mustard sauce. Cracking combination. Chips as they should be, almost like 3 way cooked chips, light and crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. Only problem was I run out of sauce right at the end! Can probably tell I really enjoyed my meal tonight, top ten chef! Thankyou
1
I got served cold chips with hot fish, I sent it back and 15 minutes later I got very hot chips and the old piece of fish I sent back placed on top. As you might guess the fish was stone cold, I called the waiter and he said to order something different because the kitchen can't coordinate two things to be hot at the same time. What a joke for $3
4
This is good restaurant where you can eat outside surrounded by trees. It is too bad that the prices are on the high side. If they lowered them a bit I would go more often.
5
We had a very enjoyable NYE family dinner. Sumptuous food, lovely service from very friendly waitress. Ambience was good and we were well taken cared by all the staff there! Will return again for more memorable experience.
4
What i can say is the food and place is good. The pizza especially crispy and the service is commendable.
5
Impeccable service, quality food at affordable prices. Was a cosy and enjoyable NYE lunch with the family.
3
Paid near $80 for two mains and did not feel that the food were value for money. Ambience was fine because the visit was made before nightfall.

I love the setting, the nice bar in surrounded by trees and a cosy atmosphere. The food is good and the burger is one of the best I've ever had!
Definitely one of the places to go if you are around Rochester.

Absolutely awful, horrible food, bisque was inedible, bolognese was tasteless. No redeeming qualities to this restaurant.

We ordered the braised beef cheek, pork ribs and the classic tiramisu. The beef cheek was tender and melts in your mouth but could do with a little more flavour. Personally I prefer wagyu beef cheeks as it has a more distinct, beef-ish flavour. Perhaps the beef cheeks could've had more seasoning to make up for the less prominent flavour. The ribs were tender and delicious and seasoned perfectly.The tiramisu here was the best I've tasted. The rich chocolate flakes in the usual plain mascarpone lifted the flavour entirely, coupled with the generously drenched ladyfingers did justice to the traditional tiramisu.Service was great too, I highly recommend this place:

As our work place has just moved out to One North, we decided to visit Rochester Park and settled on Da Paulo. We have dined at Da Paolo in Club Street and Rochester in the past and often have breakfast on a weekend at their deli on Bukit Timah.The best that can be said was that the food was fair but two average pizzas, two starters and two glasses of wine for $170 could not be classed as good value for money. There was a very lengthy delay between the serving of the first course and the second course.The main problem was the service. The young person who was our waiter was very pleasant but did not have a clue about the food or the art of serving/waiting. Not her fault - clearly she had not been trained properly eg small things like serving the soup without a soup spoon.We asked her about the size of the pizzas ie big enough to share? Her answer was no. Wrong - a good third of each of our pizzas was left over. We probably would have foregone the appetisers if we had known the pizzas were quite so large.The major service problem came at the end of the meal. We had to ask three times for the bill. When it was eventually presented we were informed that they were having problems with credit card transactions. Okay so we paid with cash. It took 15 minutes and many requests for us to get our change - leaving $30 as a tip was not in our minds

Da Paolo piqued my curiosity when there seemed to be so many people singing operas about how good its food was. My final conclusion: so so only lah.... Foie gra starter was good but really only a bit-sized portion. B4 anyone accuses me of being a greedy cheapskate over this expensive ingredient, let me clarify that I AM indeed comparing against others I've eaten. Too small.... but tastes good. Parma ham and rocket pizza was really a letdown. Soggy and the leaves really are limp. Ham was way way saltier than others I've eaten b4. But it was the soggy pizza crust that really got to me... Pasta was a washout.. Bland and soaked in oil, the accompaniment sauce didn't really add to dish. Tiramisu was touted in some reviews add the best in Singapore?! It wasn't bad but definitely not anywhere near being the best in Singapore. Al Fornos at East Coast does a much meaner tiramisu, Pepperoni at Frankel can easily best the alio olio and pizza. For the price, it's a nice ambience place for a night out but not the best value for money where quality of food is concerned.

Visit regularly on walks by botanical gardens. Good location and great for cakes or snacks. Next to Cold Storage to pick up some shopping.

Staffs are very attentive. The atmosphere was cozy and was not noisy. The foods are up to expectation and taste great.
1
Da Paolo has great pizza and pasta but this shot at doing something else is a complete failure.
Expensive wine list, poor service.
Only the location and restaurant itself are fine.
There plenty more options for italian in Singapore, pass this one,
5
Awesome food. Mushroom Risotto and Pizza Mascaporne were superb. Staff is helpful. Few veg options but good options.

Went a few times on a recent trip to Singapore. Always a great night, food is very good, service attentive and a great location that makes you feel away from the hustle and bustle.The combination of restaurant and bar area is nice and you can sit outdoors and enjoy the atmosphere
4
A pleasant terrace outside an old black and white building in Rochester Park with a modern interior. Split between a relaxed bar / lounge area and a restaurant, this particular branch of da Paolo has a good atmosphere, busy enough to be buzzing without being noisy.Visited with friends on a weekday evening without a reservation and the service staff were excellent. On arrival the hostess immediately mentioned that they were very busy and so the service might be slower than normal and asked if we were ok with that. She then found us a good table. They continued to be quite attentive throughout the evening, very friendly as well.For food the menu is tasty Italian bistro food. Good quality ingredients and simple but tasty dishes. Tuna tartare is particularly good, as are the pork ribs and fries. Good simple and reasonable wine menu by the glass or the bottle - nothing too fancy but well chosen for the food.An enjoyable evening, worth a repeat visit
3
Went there for weekday lunch and tried Set lunch menu. Fish set menu comes with either soup or salad, home made bread, (Tiny) piece of fish and dessert with Tea/Coffee.I was surprised how small the portion of pan fried fish was. We ordered Pizza Anchovies which was tasty and side bread with dip.Best part was desset which was Tiramisu cake, it was so moist, fresh and yummy that i ordered a second one.Service was prompt with smile
5
Back again to Da Paolo Bistro Bar and continues to impress. Outstanding service from arrival throughout all the dinner. Staff is very well trained and polite trying to always antecipate the needs and with good knowledge of the menu being able to describe all dishes and the technique used behind them. Food is amazing with pasta cooked to perfection , delicious pizza with very tasty crust and high quality of the toppings. Ambience is fantastic and we also had great live music....the guy had a really beautiful voice. All dishes were fantastic and we all had a very pleasant night. STRONGLY recommend!!!!

My Hubby and I have been patronizing Da Paolo Bistro Bar a few times in the last month. He is completely addicted to their Italian Salami & Fresh Chili Pizza (with Sardinian Tomato Sauce & Mozzarella) which I have to admit is always super delicious --- and I had tried a couple of their dishes but was not completely sold on any particular dish until I tasted their Grilled Australian Wagyu Rump with Rosemary Roasted Sweet Potatoes, Creamy Baby Spinach & Mushroom! The first time I had it, it was like I was in Carnivore Heaven! Saw all the cows doing the Happy Dance (okay, maybe it wasn't such a happy ending for the COWS, ha!) It was cooked Medium Rare to PERFECTION! The creamy baby spinach & mushroom were rich without being overwhelming. The meat was juicy and tasty reminded me of every single reason why I know I will never ever be a Vegetarian/Vegan! (Hmmm, I shouldn't say this too early, cause there is a reason they say "Never say never")Tonight we had yet another lovely dinner at Da Paolo Bistro Bar at Rochester Park. My hubby ordered his Italian Salami & Fresh Chili (he asked for extra chili for that extra "oommphh") and I ordered my lovely Australian Wagyu Rump. I ordered it Medium Rare but it came more as a Medium Well. When I asked them about it, they had a new steak done for me, no questions asked, was very very impressed! Thank you so very much! It's just that I had the same steak cooked to perfection the first time I had it, so having that same steak "overcooked" just a few days after was quite a disappointment (the pic shows the PERFECTLY cooked steak) I actually told my Hubby that it was THE Best Steak I had ever had in my life! Having said that, I would like to express my appreciation for Da Paolo Bistro Bar Staff for taking the steak back and have it re-done. Also, we would like to thank Sara and Kanchan for their impeccable service. We normally had Kanchan attending to us and he had always been really great! We met Sara today and we couldn't be happier. Thank you!Ambience-wise, Da Paolo Bistro Bar has the perfect ambience whether it's for the First Date or Lunch/Dinner with colleagues or simply a romantic night out with your spouse, great atmosphere! We love that they burn some mosquito coils around their outdoor areas, they really helped keep the mosquitos away and contributes to a much better dining environment.I didn't have the dessert tonight but I had their Valrhona 70% Dark Chocolate Lava Cake with Homemade Parma Ham Gelato and it was excellent! I was a bit sceptical about that Parma Ham Gelato as it seems like a very weird flavour to have in an ice cream but I guess I watched enough Food Network shows to know these "weird" flavours might pleasantly surprise you. It was creamy and "bacon-y" and delicious and it complements the dark chocolate lava cake perfectly. All in all, we are very pleased with Da Paolo Bistro Bar and we will definitely be back!

Being a long while since I step back into this lovely bistro. Food has never been the issue in this plc but somehow I'm just not the outdoor friendly person. The rashes n bites usually followed me out after my meal. Well, last night my husband and I were as usual searching for our last mins dinner plc after our very long day. Preparing to head home then remember no harm by turning in since is only 2mins from my place. As usual indoor seating was filled up, waiting staff offered us an alfresco sitting. Took my chances of being bitten and went for it.Ordered the beer and my usual crabmeat pasta while hubby preferred the 'man' stuff Beef Cheek. Both dishes were very well executed and we must be so hungry that when the waiting staff came back to check on us, she was so amazed to see 2 super clean empty plates . Can't leave this place without ordering this sinful dessert 'Salted egg yolk ice cream with deep fried man to and dice mango' and they even gave u a small amount of condemn milk to drizzle on it! Hmm bet this must have sounded weird to the foreigners but to us the local, this is simply heaven
4
Nice open bistro with a short but well prepared italian menu.
Really liked the pizzas and pastas. A wider selection of wine by the glass would be great.
4
The crabmeat tagliatelle is well done. however, the canjun sauce is a bit too salty to me. Tuna tartar is quite fresh. Prompt and friendly service as well.
4
Very nicely situated at rochester in an old black and white house. The restaurant has a different atmosphere than singapore's cbd restaurants. Great staff en good food.
4
Was invited for lunch today. There are both tables for Alfresco sitting outdoor which can be warm, and while indoor sitting under Aircon. We had a cosy table inside, and service was prompt and fast. The set lunch was good value, although under ala carte the burgers and pasta are pretty good. Had the squid ink pasta which was not too bad. Worth a return visit.
4
Went there for a second time with a group of work colleagues and customers. Pre-dinner drinks in the bar area was great with excellent service. The restaurant side of things was equally good and the menu interesting. The food was very good with a few in our group native Italians commenting favourably. Overall a lovely location and setting with good food and service. A little expensive but the quality was there
3
Been there twice: 1) drinks in a group was good, 2) Sunday lunch with my better half was a disappointment. Portions were seriously small (although advertised as substantial, probably a typo that should be substandard). We got extra protein on our plate with little ants crawling over the salad. Food was pretty uninspiring and not worth the inflated Rochester park pricing. Da Paolo can do better.
3
The big selling point is definitely the Alfresco setting in the lush green Rochester Black&White neighborhood. Food was good, had the tuna tartar for starters and beef cheeks for the main, both portions were on the small side. The tartar was lacking seasoning, especially something tangy. The beef cheeks were good with a nice gravy, the potato mash and brussel sprouts sides were minuscule though. Service was not as hard selling as some of the other reviews suggested, although they did comment to one member in our party that everyone has a starter but him. When it came to deserts our table did not want any, and there was no hard sale. Prices are on the high side considering portions and food quality, I guess the location and setting add considerably to the costs.
3
Was looking for a nice place for a business lunch and this was it. There was an air-con area and a non air-con area. The air con area can be a bit small so people can hear your conversations. We sat al fresco and that was nice with the fan blowing but I have also been there where it is too hot. Food was forgettable though. Didn't like the burratina - there was no kick because no sauce, stingy with only one piece of ham to balance the cheese and the large tomato was just not juicy enough and not the same as the small sweet cherry tomatoes. Complete disappointment. How can one mess up this dish? Also had the salad with slipper lobster. The small amount of lobster slipper lobster was mixed into the salad so no presence, avocado was slightly raw - again, nothing to remember. And of course they had to rush us with the bill etc even though we were in the midst of conversation
3
As other reviewers have said, the setting is fabulous, and the bar side of the operation is very good as well. It's just such a shame that the restaurant side is so hit and miss. The service switches between disinterested to over selling...the latter to the point where it becomes annoying and inappropriate. We had to ask if there were any specials (answer: T-Bone steak...no detail on how it was served, price or anything else) but once we finished making our order we had to endure a hard sell on starters, which is a bit weird at that point. Then, having asked for a wine list, we practically had to kidnap the waiter to order the wine, with the hard up-sell after we had ordered, rather than any attempt to suggest wines at the beginning. Then once the food came, which was very good, the snapper was served with only a teaspoon of couscous (possibly the cheapest foodstuff available), so we asked for more, and two spoons worth is served 10 mins later and $5 added to the bill. It all smacks of an operation which is dedicated to maximising its profit but hasn't figured out that if you want to do that you need to train your staff properly and think about the customer experience a little.Oh, and the bottle of fizzy water on each table is frankly a bit grubby. Appreciate it's an Italian but it's never good to mimic the behaviour of the tourist cafes in Venice

I have been to Da Paulo's a couple of times now and absolutely love it. The first time I came with work colleagues on a Thursday evening and we had 1 for 1 drinks at the bar in the gorgeous outdoor setting on the sofa area. We were given tasty complimentary sliders.Then we moved into the main restaurant (outside still although there is an inside option) and I ordered the wagu burger wrapped in Palma ham with brie and caramelised onions in olive bread with fries. It was sooooo good! So good in fact that I went back the following Saturday evening with family and had it again! And so did they and everyone loved it. My partner had the ribs which were delicious also. On the Saturday evening the drinks are not 1 for 1 but they do have a live singer and guitarist which is very special and adds to the ambience.I will definitely be returning and recommend this place to everyone
3
Excellent service and great food. Pricing can be better but overall a great experience. Good family place for dinner.
4
Went to a networking event on the 2nd floor. Perfect for ~20-30pax to stand around and chat. Food was good and hot. Staff were warm and friendly. Ambience was nice. Cannot say anything bad about this place. Only issue might be parking!
3
The Da Paolo outlet at The Sail is always a good choice for coffee during the week. This morning was no exception: morning meeting over a cappuccino. Also a decent selection of baguettes for lunch.
2
i am quite a regular diner here but unfortunately standards have been falling consistently.
In particular, the service staff are totally inexperienced and the expat restaurant manager has a totally "can't be bothered" attitude and actually looks bored throughout the time I was there.
4
Good restaurant with nice ambience. We sit outside for dinner and i had the wagyu rump. I ordered it medium and it came like i expected it to be. Meat quality was very good.
5
Our first time dining there, great food, great service and great ambience. We had tuna tartare, lobster salad, squid ink pasta, tenderloin steak which was their special menu last night. Get the bread too! We will surely return.
4
I had pasta, which was good, but for ~$30 I expect amazing (although in Singapore cheap/good pasta is hard to find). The atmosphere is one of the main reasons to go. Very sheek, but there are only fans, no aircon. The mixed drinks are amazing.
4
I had my birthday celebration here, the staffs are very warm. We ordered 1 starter-salad, 3 main course- 2 pasta and one fish, a tiramisu and a bottle of wine.The crab pasta is so yummy. wine also great. And my cousin love the tiramisu very much.After we finished starter and main course, the tiramisu served in surprise manner. The waiters bring the cake from ... behind and singing with birthday song. It really touching, unexpected will be in this way.After finished all our meal, we requested to sit outside. It is totally different ambience from inside. Outside is tend to be more relax and natural, suitable for chit chat and hang around

Where do I start?! Rochester area is a fantastic location, many wonderful restaurants here and the near isolation you feel from the hustle and bustle that is Singapore is great!Da Paolos has a lovely bar area on the right side as you enter and the restaurant on your left (outdoors and indoors and available in what seems a converted black & white) - real nice decor and atmosphere. We were a party of 15 and enjoyed a couple of drinks before we were seated. All well so far. But when we tried to order drinks at the table we were told that the 2 for 1 at bar no longer applied! Walk 10 meters to the bar, it's on again! Ridiculous rule, happy hour is happy hourwe had pre ordered food and while the waiting staff were confirming the order they started selling more appetisers... We politely declined but they kept selling. In the end one of our party caved in and we ended up ordering about 8 appetisers to get the waiters to leave us aloneBut oh no... off they go again and now try start up selling the main courses... borderline harassment at this stage... "add froi gras sir"... "lobster is good with that"... you get the pictureThe mountains of appetiser appeared and admittedly tasted fine. Good portions, well presented etc. We hadn't finished when one of the servers tried to clear my plate. I politely said no but he persisted 3 times trying to clear it! No is NO! Eventually he left me finish in peace - there were others still eating so it wasn't me holding up the showThe main courses came and everyone seemed happy. Again nicely cooked, nicely presented and tasted real good. No problems with the chef in this place!No one really wanted dessert but you can guess... The onslaught of selling everything to us... If individuals said no the waiters pushed for shared desserts and kept at the person who caved in at the appetiser onslaught until she said ok and lo and behold, we have a table of desserts.The bill to have the 3 courses will cost you about $85-95 per head. Not bad for the location, the lovely surroundings, very good food etc and I'd normally 4 star a place like this willingly - the staff are the problem... too pushy, annoyingly so and put a small damper on a nice meal... will go again but if the staff again re like that again will just walk out

Da Paolo's could be one of the gems of Singapore. Could be, but isn't.The setting amongst other black and whites on Rochester is really beautiful. You have a view of tress and lush greenery and if you didn't know it, wouldn't believe there were condo's and a main road just a hop and skip away.The bar side of Da Paolo's is fabulous. Good cocktail selection and comfortable lounges or bar seating.The manager did a great job of welcoming us and ensuring our party of 14 were looked after for pre dinner drinks.When we sat down things started to go a little pearshaped. The service was initially good , then things seemed to take an inordinate length of time to come out. When it did though the shared entrees were very good and worth waiting for. As were the mains. Everyone commented on how good their meals were, no gripes here. But again the service was slow with some people getting their meals some time after the first plates were put down.Then the most extrodinary thing happened. We were part way through main course and the waiter approached us and asked us to look at the dessert menu as we were told we had to order as the kitchen was closing at 11.30.This included ordering coffees. What is that about? Here were 14 people having a great time with the wine pouring freely and we were being asked to basically hurry up and finish our meals. To say it put a dampener on the night was an understatement. People who had earlier been lavishing praise on Da Paolos were now muttering about how bad the service was and they weren't coming back. Poor form I say.So, if you can put up with very ordinary service, for having a very good meal in a beaut setting then take the plunge and book
4
Very nice venue with great atmosphere.
Food was very tasty - though portions were on the small side.
Canapés were very good and plentiful
4
If you wanna treat yourself please go ahead and try Da Paolo croissants, coffe, scones: excellent breakfast and nice atmosphere at Katong 112. Very nice real italian drinks with San Pellegrino specialty orange drink and others, Nastro Azzurro beer and so on. The pre prepared food is overprized though: the lasagna, the pasta and the wines are almost outrageous.Anyway nice and enjoyabl
4
Pizza is really good here, bases are thin and crispy, cheeses are the real deal and topics are fresh and varied. On a par with pizza mozzarella, but significantly better priced. We live in Holland village and probably come here once or twice per month, and the food and service are always reliably good. Pastas are average, but the salads are very good (pizza and a salad to between two people works well). Happy hour before 730pm, with one for one on peroni draft and wines
4
Da Paolo is one of my favourite places to go for a relaxing evening after work or a weekend lunch due to its gorgeous setting in a black and white house in Rochester Park and the outdoor terrace provides a great seating area. The food is Italian comfort food for when you need a bit of spoiling, my all time favourite being the Pan-Seared US Scallops with White Wine Tagliolini with a good glass of white wine
5
The food was great, portion was a little small for the mains though. The tiramisu was terrific. The ambience for both indoors and alfresco was comfortable, nice, and had great lighting. The service staff were very alert and efficient. Even the washroom was well maintained, clean and felt like home. It was a great experience and I would definitely return/recommend the place :) 
2
Hidden amongst lush greenery a hidden collection of black and whites, a great place to go for a drink or brunch, we have been on several occasions always had great service and food....until we went for a drink tonight after a concert and we got served by the bald bar manager!!! He is certainly dead wood in this establishment and simply doesn't seem to really care about his patrons. He was rude, arrogant and defiantly needs to go for some refresher training...we nearly walked out and it wasn't busy. ..We didn't leave with the effort and great service we then received from the bar man Selva he saved the night and mixed a good drink....To the management why isn't Selva the Bar Manger! I will return only because of service we received from Selva...Thank yo
5
Very nice location in Rochester Park and quite a nice place. Nice and cozy place with good music.This place has really good food and very good service. They have incredible burgers, really good pizzas and desserts. This is probably one of the best restaurants that I went to in Singapore. Highly recommend this place
4
Very nice atmosphere set in a great and quiet location. If you want to enjoy an al fresco drink prior to your diner, it is the perfect place. The food is very good, ingredients are fresh and service is excellent. This venue suits family, friends or business diner which is quite rare in Singapore. If you have not been there, do go, if you have been you will certainly go back 
4
Very nice location, great Italian ingredients. If you like pasta and don't like cream, ask to cook it without it otherwise they soak the spaghetti into the cream (Asian style?). Selection of wine is poor but overall acceptable considering the place.Staff is excellent. DJ makes the difference. Great location for an aperitif too
5
My first review of Da Paolo did not do it justice - in particular the wonderful, friendly service. We were regulars when we lived across the street and were treated like friends. Also, the food is really good -- best arrabiata sauce I've tasted -- my fiance even asks for a side order when he gets the burger. We recently moved from the neighborhood after 4 years and we really miss hanging out at the bar in familiar surroundings. I daresay its unlikely we'll find a place where we feel as comfortable in our new neighborhood and its likely we'll return to Da Paolo soon even though its now a bit out of the way for us! We definitely recommend
4
Food is nice, mainly Italian fare. The big plus is the nice green surroundings. My personal favourite is the bar, nice comfy chairs, gives you a real "holiday feeling"
3
Great outdoor space in lush surroundings but the food was underwhelming and very overpriced for what it is. My husband and I had lunch at the restaurant. We ordered a Burratina with Parma ham which was disappointing. The tomato wasn't ripped, the burrata was more watery than buttery and the parma ham was tasteless. The Wagyu Rump which my husband had was decent. The Ossobuco risotto I had was just average. The meat was rather stringy and the risotto soggy. The Tiramisu which is supposedly their house special was uninspiring. We also had two coffees and a bottle of sparkling water and the bill came to a little over SG$170 which is rather pricey for food that lacks thought.
4
We live across the street from Da Paolo BistroBar and are regulars. While the food is pretty good, what we like in particular is the outdoor space that is covered, but you still feel like you are enjoying your surroundings - a plus in Singapore where it rains often. The bar is a regular hang out spot for us. I'd recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice low key ambience. Service is friendly
5
We booked this restaurant for a class parents social and it exceeded expectations. We were a large group of 30+ but the evening went wonderfully well despite our request that each couple prepay their own bill to avoid a big total at the end. We had reserved an area for drinks in the bar followed by dinner in the main restaurant. The reservations were easy without the need for form filling and deposits being paid. The staff were cooperative and attentive and no mistakes were made. The food came quickly and was delicious. The environment was very warm and yet classy. We all had a lovely evening and we will definitely be returning in the future
4
That is a great place to meet friends, you will be welcomed at the entrance, almost at you ride door, you will be taken to that great outdoor bar where the cocktail where very good considering that I've asked for something that was not on the menu. There was a life band playing, and then you will be moved to your table where the food and service where very impressive. Highly recommende

Nestled against the lower slope in the tree-lined Rochester enclave, da Paolo Bistro Bar is set in a re-furbished Colonial bungalow with indoor and outdoor sheltered seating, and an alfresco bar area. The laid-back ambience allows time for a leisurely lunch or a romantic dinner.The Italian menu has a modern touch with its fresh and creative offerings. Salads of baby spinach/ wild rocket and tomatoes tossed lightly with olive oil/ balsamic and topped with a selection of cheese/ grilled chicken and pine nuts/ prawn and mango are refreshing to taste. Pizza combinations of minced beef and bechamel, arugula and Parma ham, salmon and mushroom, avocado and chicken are surprising on the palate. Even the homemade egg-pasta tagliatelle with crabmeat in vodka cream and tagliolini with crayfish in white wine and herbs give different sensations.The personable service of the staff, recommending drinks, checking on our dinner and happy to take photos, makes the whole dining experience memorable despite a second glance at the somewhat steep bill
5
We took a party of 6 to diner. Food was very good. Service was perfect and the wine recommended was even better than the one I had previously ordered. After diner we sat in the lounge with it great tropical atmosphere were we could smoke a cigar with a great glass of rum.Overall a really good evening in a special place
4
This truly is a hidden gem in Singapore but I get the impression it is still finding out what sort of restaurant it really is. The first challenge is finding the place but once you do there is instant reward. Nestled on a hill amongst old colonial buildings I visited at night - amazing. I couldn't work out whether this was pizzeria or fine dining or whether that statement is a compliment or not. I suppose I've seen similar in Italy. Good sized entree, pizza and main menuI had the wagyu beef and it was spectacular. Washed down with a non offfensive but uninspiring Shiraz Cabernet from South Australia I had never heard of. And a tad expensive. Very small wine listOverall happy to recommend. Service good and the patronage indicates its we'll regarded
3
I had cauliflower pizza and lobster pasta. Good but not special. Altho i preferred the pizza to the pasta. The atmosphere was not pleasant as it was quite hot and sweaty. The music was quite loud and not the soothing, soft type. Service was not overwhelming neither was it sincere but not rude eithe
4
I have been to this restaurant and cafe several times and now decided to write. Being frequent patron of Da paolo, I always visit this outlet and Botanical garden. This restaurant serve great coffee and choice of croissants. Value meal starts at 6.80 per set. Have great muffins, scones and other choice of set breakfast to choose. Service has been better. Not previously..
4
Situated in Rochester Park adjoining my hotel. great lunch on the patio which is surrounded by trees and greenery. Tranquil atmosphere and really good food.
3
My Husband and I had dinner at Da Paolo. We ordered drinks but they came after we had the starter. And the waitress brought the wrong drink. Thenmain course came to fast, so our night out was done in 45 minutes. Food was good and tasty, so sad the staff is not well trained
4
Four of us had dinner here. We asked for the piped music to be turned down, and it was, promptly. Good food and wine. Young waitress was cheerful and enthusiastic, albeit a little flustered pouring the wine: dribbled some over table by each person. Not a stuffy place, good food, would happily go again
4
Bit surprised by some of the comments below. Whilst the service was not startling I think being upstairs meant we were out of the way a bit. The chef did come around a couple of times which was a nice touch. Wagyu burger was excellent and the crab tagliatelle was pretty good as well. Think I would prefer to be downstairs and. The bar area looked a great place to hang out. Will try it again....
4
Delicious, they melt in your mouth, and the garlic mayonnaise is special. A pity the French fries were soggy, because the ribs were lying on them for better loooks. May be need to serve them crispy on the side. Also the salads were good and the Tiramisu one of the better ones in Singapore. We felt the service was good, attentive, starting with a warm and pleasant welcome in arrival, all the way to the end. Will come back for more
4
The converted colonial house makes an interesting setting for a meal with its patios and plants. The food was tasty and well presented. I had the Wagyu beef rump and my colleague the spectacular-looking wagyu burger (Not unreasonably priced at S$52 & S$31 respectively). Overall a very pleasant experience
2
Knowing of Da Paolo for many years, we thought we would try the latest addition to the group, The setting is pretty in an old black and white house on the very peaceful and leafy Rochester Park.Parking was a problem and we ended up Valet parking 3 minutes walk away.The bar area had loud music playing which was not very relaxing at all, We asked to go to our table, but it was still very noisy, more like a nightclub than a restaurant.The seating and atmosphere of the restaurant is too casual, rough wooden tables and wobbly chairs and paper napkins.I had the beef carpaccio, which had been rolled around soft cheese, very average, not much taste.My husband had goats cheese salad which he said was just okay, he could much feta or any olives in it as stated on the menuBread was charged at 9 dollars, any one in Europe that is four pounds fiftyWine was 18 dollars a glass for very average wineDraught beer was 14 dollarsI had the seabass which was overcooked and had some mango sauce dumped on the top, and lay on a bed of tasteless polenta. My husband had yellow tail kingfish, which tasted like salmon, with some vegetablesall that cost 237 dollars 20 dollars was service charg
2
Food is good. Used to frequent the Holland Village outlet until the rude service totally put my friends and I off. Stayed away since but started to pop by the Da Paolo's Gastrobar in Katong for takeaways. Lo and behold, bad service seems to plague this setup. I suspect there is little or no training given to service staff. No 'Thanks Yous' or smiles from one customer to the next. Imagine, the cashier said, "Here, take your receipt' in a rude tone. It really is a pity the service is SO bad. The food quality is good. It is just such a put-off.

Having heard about the good reviews about the recent new menu, decided to head out for a try. For more details and photos, visit : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2012/12/da-paolo-bistro-bar.htmlthe Parma Ham & Packham Pear pizza, grilled barramundi with the lovely spicy avocado and mango salsa on top of fluffy couscous rice were outstanding but not the Iberico Pork Ribs with potato wedges and garlic alioli desserts like chocolate caramel bar and the salted caramel pannacotta are not to be missed but the chocolate souffle was slightly disappointing

Visited with work colleagues and a customer, and everyone was surprised by the quality and quantity of food. I can’t comment on the overall price as I just ordered a main for myself, and our host arranged the various appetizers, drinks and desserts and I didn’t see the final bill.I can say that everything I ate was delicious. It’s not easy to get a good salad in Singapore, and my salad was better than good… it was great. And the coffee at the end of the meal was first-rate.I’m hard to impress, but this was one place I’d like to return with my wife

visited the Club street outlet for a set lunch for a business meeting.
Food was as usually of a very high quality.
Pricing at S$ 29++ for a 3 course lunch is perfect.
Ambience is god for a business meeting
Will go there again soon.

The place is stunning in the middle of the gardens, you do not feel in Singapore. The food was good and the white wines were amazing!

After our great experience at the Da Paolo restaurant on club street we decided to visit the Rochester park venue.The venue is stunning, in a classic black and white villa in the middle of a park you really get a great country style feeling when entering the place. The service was friendly and quick and gave us a good place - we came around lunch time, reservation is a must. We ordered a simple starter - bruschetta and the tomatoes were fantastic. Simple and great, just how Italian food should be. As mains we had linguini with crab and a pizza with gorgonzola. Both home made - and you could tast it.As it was lunch we had non alcoholic home made ice teas - which were not to sweet and refreshing. As already mentioned before - the setting is unique, and in combination with the excellent food i can really recommend the place.As a nice grand final - the staff brought us complimentary tiramisu and candles when they found out its my wifes birthday

Just coming back from sadly rather disappointing dinner.We had quite high expectations as the location and the place itself were promising. The overall ambiance of the restaurant is quite nice and we thought it's our perfect choice for a special family gathering.We though wanted to first check the food and service and we are glad we did.For starter we had Burrata on Parma. The arrangement was already very lifeless and the taste, though the Burrata was yummy a bit overall bland. I think it's not enough to just cut a few slices of parma arrange them in a star and drop the Burrata in the center of the plate. Add a bit of pepper, maybe a bit of olive oil and salt and you start to get something. We are talking here about a solid 60 quit.Our mains, tagliatelle in crab sauce and beef tenderloin with polenta. *sigh*. The Tagliatelle was generic and the crab meat was completely blended in the sauce that you tasted some, but still overwhelmed by the tomato sauce. The beef was not really evenly tender cooked and the sauce lacked also some originality.I'm writing this also in comparison to another place we just tried the night before, where we got for the same value another class of food served.I think da paolo is not terrible, but it's surely generic and for that a bit overpriced. I'm sorry to say that, especially after we liked it as a venue the most. But the food just did fall behind our wishes

I have been there with my family and it has been a very nice experience. We took a mix of bruschettas (very good), some pasta (tasty and well done), pizza (good) and a plate of cheeses (it was ok). Wine was very good even if too expensive (as everywhere in Singapore). In total we have spent about $400 for 5 person, a bit too much in my opinion. Btw, as said, it has been a positive experience. If you are looking for traditional italian food, this is not the place. If instead you would like to try a contemporary italian restaurant, where new ingredients and new combinations are attempted, you will probably enjoy it

Like most of the other restaurants at Rochester Park once you get past the amazing setting and the cool vibe what you are left with is service that is lacking polish and food that is typically average especially given the price that is charged.A three-person party was turned away in front of us as they had no reservations .My partner and I were able to get some space in the bar area. We decided to share a pizza for entree and then move on to pasta for the main. The Mozzarella and Ham pizza was out very quickly - in less than ten minutes - and was okay. A little too oily and the base was a bit inconsistent with some bubbles in it. My spaghetti was under-done - not quite al dente and probably needed another minute or two. My partner's penne was well under-done and nowhere near al dente. Cooking pasta is pretty easy and you would expect that an Italian restaurant would nail it every time so it is disappointing when they get it wrong.As we were sitting in the bar area we were exposed to another party's cigarette and cigar smoke. We mentioned it on the way out and the response from the staff was poor. They looked stunned, embarrassed and like they didn't know what to do or say. There were empty tables in the restaurant part right throughout the time that we were there and they easily could have seated us away from the bar and the smoke.Another issue was the amount of time that it took the staff to return the change after we had paid the bill. It was well over ten minutes and on top of the poor food and smoke summed up the whole experience.The setting is fantastic and the restaurant looks great and it is a shame that the food and service lets it down.There are far better Italian restaurants all over Singapore with better food and service. I would advise readers to give this place a miss

A Sunday brunch doesn't get better than this. Good food, nice choices of wines to choose from, and one can go out to other cafes close by for a coffee. And there you have it, a Sunday well spent!Oh btw, around 50-70 SGD per head...Remember, Singapore is rather humid a place, so weather is all too important, since the best seatings at this place are outside

I went to this place with friends and just loved it. This place had some really nice food. Especially the Pizza and the Tiramisu which was to die for. The location of this place is also very nice so you can spend some time here selecting some nice restaurants before zeroing on this one

Da Paolo provides a stable source of decent quality food, but somehow never gives a "wow" experience. If you are close by and fancy Italian food of decent quality, go for it. Disappointment only for those who seek outstanding. Or, like speedy service, because that we didn't get, at all

If you are after good service, attentive waiters, decent food, clean glasses and affordable fare then this aint the place.The lobster risotto was hard and under-cooked, duck's liver pate was beautiful and tasted delicious however the 30 minute wait between courses was stretching it on a quite night, the bread on offer was burnt on the outside (someone had re-heated the bread to close to the grill - why someone would serve this up to guests is beyond me) and wine glasses presented were chilled but had someone else's lipstick still smattered on the lip of the glass. Waiter didnt even notice it.Two glasses of wine and a ravioli dish that was more like an appetizer and you have a bill for SGD130.Didnt fancy staying for dessert or limoncella.You can do better eating elsewhere
