A friend recommended this casual shop, and it did not disappoint. Ordered crab cooked two ways: soupy with noodles, and sitr-fried in black pepper. Usually, similar orders cost much more in other shops, so our bill (45sgd for three persons) was a pleasant surprise.

I have known Don since 2002 at China Square Central then under Don Pie. He started to expand his business to cooked food like laksa and mee hoon crab among others. Last week, we ordered mee hoon crab, chilli crab and mee hoon prawn and lala takeaway. The food is very well packed. The crab meat is tasty and we liked it very much.Their opening hours are from 12 noon to 8.30pm daily. You can also call to order for takeaway or sit in meals

My friends and I had the Crab Bee Hoon and Black Pepper Crab Bee Hoon. The soup base was lovely for the crab bee hoon and other than the crab, I love the taro in the soup as it absorbed all the flavours from the soup and crab. Also, there were a lot of flavours in the Black Pepper Crab. A must try

Fresh crab with an awesome chilli dip to boot. Herbal milky soup with thick bee hoon to fill up your belly! Prices depend on the size of the crab you get! They serve other varieties of cooking for the crab incl chilli (which im sure is awesome) For a no frills crab dining experience. Head to Don's Crab

It was not as creamy soup base as other competitor crab mee hoon, but it has more herbal (danggui) inside which makes their soup so tasty and unique. I love it! It is affordable too if you want your budget seafood meal. We only ordered one pot for 2, cos we might not able to finish them all. They have also laksa crab/prawn pot nowadays, and one other unique crab and prawn dishes in their menu. I will definitely go again

$60 for 3 persons?!? For crabs cooked in 2 different dishes in 2 contrasting ways? Fresh mud crabs (firm and sweet) bathed in herbal milky broth and vermicelli? Whoop whoop! (For the uninitiated, it's a herbal concoction of Chinese wine and Angelica root etc). Delish! We much preferred that to the dry fried preparation of the crab vermicelli... nonetheless, excellent value!! Just have to sweat it out in the humid coffee shop. Kudos, Don! Great cheap eat

Have had Don's crab for more than one occasion, mostly takeaways and havealways relished going back there again for the tasty soup and the succulentmud crab meat...I can attest to the fact that Don uses no msg and the herbs he uses is as good asit gets.Only downside unfortunately would be the size of the serving in relationfor the price we pay in comparison to the neighbouring stalls. Hence, Don is only reserved for special occasions for us

First time I tried Don's signature crab, it was located in China Square, Glad to have found it again after the relocation. We ordered the $30 portion of Claypot Beehoon for 2 to share. It was so heavenly and fulfilling we were quickly back for more the following week!For the 2nd time, we tried Black Pepper crabs with dry beehoon. We would be back soon to try their Chili crab with mantou!Quality crab at HDB heartland prices
