Nice food. But a little warm in the restaurant and not v good service due to shortage of waiters. Could be more attentive. Short of cutlery

Everything went smoothly and the staff were very forthcoming when entertaining to our requests. Had a pleasant experience, won't hesitate coming again:)

Food was average except the baked potato which was their trademark but that was quite average too . Nothing very much to be excited about

Went to Jack's for belated birthday lunch with family. The set lunches are good value for money. I like the rib eye steak and baked potato with everything on.

Pasta was too plain, soup is not very hot but grill chicken tastes not bad. Not crowed during lunch time, can try....

Jack's place is well known to all Singaporeans. They serve good value for set lunches, good steaks and seafood eg lobster etc. A safe bet for any foreign visitors.

Before the renovation in bukit panjang plaza, we used to frequent Jack Place quite often. However, after the renovation and Jack Place has shifted his physical location, we find that the place is more open and not as exclusive as it used to be. However, the more important point is that we found that the food did not taste as good as before the renovation though the dish that we ordered is similar. We are not sure if there is any change of the chef or mgt after the renovation, but it does seem different.

I like to go Jack Place for dinner. Why? because the service is very good.I like to eat set meal where you can choose your dessert and soup.I am slightly disappointed that JP stop offering US steak but only NZ steak.(there are currently two branches that offer US steaks- Great World City and the Grandstand.) I ordered soup , steak, and drink and desserts. When I finished my main course (steak), the wait staff automatically bring out dessert and coffee beverage. That's efficiency.The wait staff don't have to wait for me to say ''dessert pls''. Then he bring out.Other restaurants , not up to par. because they don't automatically bring out dessert, They will wait for people to say ''dessert pls''

Enjoyed the service there, the food there is not as good as 20 years before but it still cater to customer likeing(that is a good point there), but still can enjoy a good meal there. The envroment setting there is good, the deco was not bad(e.g. fellowing the theam of chirstmas when i visited this is not bad idea). Will revisit again

My wife and I sampled wonderful cuisine at the Anchorpoint edition of Jacks Place restaurant. I had the S$25 lobster and venison combo, my wife had S$22 NZ Steak and fish combo. Both these meals were outstanding!There was also a very friendly, helpful, sound advice from a lovely service lady.... She struggled with English pronunciation, but was persistent, and courteous.A lovely place, relaxed, easy going and the food was sensational

Located in central singapore at orchard rd, it is famous for its steak and set meal with reasonable good price. The atmosphere is serene and clean, Service are good and the meals are nice

Good value for anyone who wants a western style meal. Good money for value set lunches. Steaks are not bad.. good for the price that you are paying

Singapore is already so commercialized that we hardly taste service in most of the restaurants anymore. Had lunch with 3 grandsons and their parents at Jack's place (City Square) was really unexpected with the quality service their team had provided. We enjoyed the lunch with good suggestion and patiencely explained by a young lady. When we requested for extra plates and cutlery for our twins, it was attended immediately. Keep up the good service, Singapore Food outlets should learn from this team

This restaurant is located at Basement 1, #B1-25, Century Square, 2 Tampines Central 5, Singapore 529509.This rest. is always busy during peak hours, Sat., Sunday and Public Holidays. So try to avoid these timing.The salad that I had ordered was Chef Salad. It was very fresh; with lettuces, two cold meats, cheese slices, egg sices, cucumbers and tomatoes slices, topped up with olives. The dressing was thousand island; which taste good; not so salty. If you prefers to have it fresh, just leave out the dressings. It is evenly good and fresh.We also ordered Pro Tenderoin. They cooked it just good at medium, serving piping hot topped with vegetables of the day, sauce, and one whole potato.You could opt to opt the potato with sauce, spring onions and bacons pieces.To save cost, you could also top up with a small sum to get a drink and dessert after meal. the dessert is usually in the form of cake, apple pie from time to time.This rest. is quite spaceous with plenty of seats, but always taken up. the services is quite OK,but during peak hours, services will be slower.The pricing is quite on the reasonable side, if I compare them with others.But the coffee was not served very hot, therefore after awhile, the coffee becomes cold.This place serves fresh fruits juices too, which I am glad about it. If you are not too picky about food, this is a good place to dine in

Had lunch here and found it to be reasonable good. I had fish, while my colleagues had steak. I should have gotten the steak too probably as it seems to be a trademark here. Service was good and we were in a hurry, so we were thankful. I would eat here again, but not go out of my way to come back

Went to Jack's Place one weekend for the very first time at NEX Serangoon. The restaurant was busy and we had to wait a while before our orders were taken. We ordered 2 adult mains and 2 kids meals and feedback on the food as follows:Mexican Style Steak - this was supposedly their specials and on the first page of the menu. Beef was really tough and fatty and served on a hot plate with some pasta and fries. What a weird combo. Meat was already overcooked by the time it reached our table and I ordered my steak medium. I've never fancied steaks served in a hot plate. It's too chinese-styled and tends to overcook the meat. Remember having these in HK when I was there for work. Taste wise, I'd give it a 4/10. Jack's Special Steak - this was a lot more tender however the missus thought it was just alright and much preferred the steaks at Outback Steakhouse. Fish and chips - the fish served was what I know as basa fillets. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/van.general/CAdXXTSI0u8Spaghetti bolognaise - this was the worst dish of the lot. The sauce tasted awful and the beef used definitely wasn't fresh beef mince. There was a very strong gamey smell to it. It made me think of "pink slime", made famous by Jamie Oliver. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_slimeI wouldn't bring my kids back to this place or any of it's other outlets...just like how I wouldn't bring them to McDonalds

I have been going to Jacks since 1977 when the Killiney road restaurant was rated as the best steak house in Singapore.Recently went to Jacks at parkway parade, service lousy, served up with luke warm Oysters which should have been cold, obviously they defrosted frozen oysters with hot water..Complained to management and head office, and they simply don't care. That's the problem with Jacks today and sums up why the standards have fallen so abysmally low.I'll never go back there so long as JP Pepperdine are in control. Its cheap and nasty.Good luck JP Pepperdine

This place is not bad as a way to get out of the food courts and into the air con but the food is just so so. Service is typical Singaporean--- they try but just don't get it. The menu says that the steaks are grilled but...by that they mean flat griddle grilled. Mine certainly was not cooked on a grill.

We went there for lunch.this place is great place to have lunch expecially the set lunch was so nice.all should try it..

Good western food served. The waiting time is average, acceptable. Food is good! It is a bit expensive but considering the environment it is okay. Students have discount and there are more than 3 types of kids meal! Love it!

Well serviced and looked after little restaurant. Has the atmosphere of an italian restaurant. Had only a budget lunch time offer menu (3 courses). Was very good. Next time I will try the steaks. Was recommended by my hotel staff.

This was a popular dating restaurant during my teenager days studying in Singapore. I loved the baked potatoes and the food still tasted like the olden days. Of course the menu has been revamped but the ambience of the restaurant at Parkway Parade has remained the same

I went to Jack's Place for lunch with my friend. Ordered the daily lunch set. I had the Sirloin Steak with onions. Steak well seared and medium rare in the middle, which was to my liking, however the steak sauce is a little under seasoned. Dessert was mango pudding and it was fine. However pricing was great! Staff was polite and patient too. wonderful lunch spent at Jack's Place

This is definitely a family restaurant. We went to the Nex, Serangoon branch. I was a little disappointed with the service as there were about 3-4 groups queueing, and yet there were 4-5 uncleared empty tables. The manager rather spent his time organizing the queue than helping to clear the tables. There was no one clearing the tables despite the fact that at least 4 waiters were seen in the dining area.We waited for about 15 minutes in the queue. After seated and our orders taken, food arrived in about 15 mins.I don't think I will come back as there are many other restaurant which can offer the same quality food, same price, but better ambience and service

If you can't quite decide what to eat, this is the perfect restaurant for you. It serves everything from local to Western cuisines, fish to chicken and steaks. The food is probably a level better than that of a fast food restaurant but not any better. If you manage your expectations, you'll be fine eating at this restaurant
3
Best thing about this place was that it was quick, and not just in service but in how quickly the food was prepared and served (which may explain why it was only so-so in terms of quality, or perhaps it was worth what you paid for it, which wasn't all that much). So, go there to fill yourself up with some good comfort food. And don't expect much atmosphere

I had written about JP before & my latest mission was to try out the new outlet in nex. Although i tried to be hospitable & friendly toward the waiting staff, new recruits, managers & supervisors, the juniors appreciated such encouraging gestures but not from the seniors. Having patronising there for 12 times since its inception end of last year, i find the seniors just don't know how to build rapport with loyal clients or diners. To them, its just another number to add into their profit and loss. Unlike good retaurants who treasure their precious clientele, the retention is always higher than previous years. I feel JP has a yaya papaya attitude which i reckon must have flowed down from the management. Dining is notjust about fresh ingredients used, delicious food to impact memory, efficient services but also about making repeat customers feek they belong to the organisation. Unfortunately, through the years since 1990 till todate, this coldness from senior staff has grown stronger everytime I brought my family to dine there. The old guards seem to appreciate & protect rapport with customers through their warmth & genuine frienships, not these current generation of managers & supervisors except the team under Mr Toon's (@ AMK branch) leadership & mentorship. I reckon once my card expires, i would loathe to continue becoming a member but abort this 20 long years of supporting, advertising & promoting JP. Too bad, they just don't know how to treasure loyal & supportive clientele
