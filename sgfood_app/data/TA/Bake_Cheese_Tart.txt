Tried the cheese tarts once and decided to go back. The store is located in ION Orchard’s basement 4. The staff were friendly and service was fast.

Best cheese tart in the world! The cheese was the premium cheese and fresh. One tart cannot fulfil my stomach. Strongly recommend to all of you

One thing BAKE is known for only... Cheese Tarts! And YES, they are amazing. They are freshly baked and when you taste it, you will can never stop. The middle part is super creamy while the outside is crispy and so tasty. One thing not so good.... the price. Yes, they are pricey. So prepare to bring out your precious $19.50 bucks for half a dozen tarts to enjoy them.

I got a freshly baked tart and the filling was oozing hot with good and delicious cheese! It tasted so scrumptious that I immediately got a second tart. And upon bringing my box home, the texture of the tarts have become denser, most likely due to the air conditioning but they still tasted very good! And I must say I now prefer the denser consistency.The box comes with a card that details instructions on how to enjoy the tart.1) hot - with oozing filling2) chilled - the consistency becomes denser3) frozen - like ice cream (which I haven't tried out yet)Definitely the best cheese tart I have tasted

Tart crust is fragrant and cheese filling is rich and awesome. Not to be missed if you are nearby. They have another outlet at Nex mall at Serangoon mrt station.Lines are not as long as before making it easier to indulge in this yummy tarts. Store is located at basement 4 of Ion shopping mall. It's a takeaway counter.A little pricey for a small tart but definitely worth the price and calories :-

A must try in Singapore! I went in line and waited to try these cheese tart, and they were so good. The crust was so flaky and the cheese topping was so airy and cheesy. I am just so glad that the employees were very polite and honest on how to store them. We bought a dozen, I believe it was 6 for 19 sgd and were advised to refrigerate them or freeze them before travel.

When this place opened, they had long queues that stretched far into the atrium and kept you in line for up to 45 minutes. I don't think the tarts are worth such a wait but now that the craze has died down, it's worth a stop. They are expensive mouth-size tartlets but delicious and just the right texture. The competitor would be Pablo at Wisma Atria - for the same price, I feel Bake offers a slightly better product. Though I admit, Pablo has more variety and a sitting area

I love cheese so much and I always bought some when I visit baked tart. They always maintain the quality of the product and I am so lucky to be able to taste this tart. hahaHere is my vlog for more details: search by title : En channel:#12 SINGAPORe - PABLO - SEPHORA - SHOPPING - TOY SALE

Been wanting to try this cheese tart but been held back last year due to the long queues. This time round there is no queue at all, bought 6 pcs and it tasted so good. We went back and bought another 6 pcs, it was that good

Given the long lines and high prices, I gave Bake Cheese Tart many misses. It happened that on one occasion when I walked by it, there was no one in line! Curiosity got the most of me and I bought one cheese tart to try. One bite and I understood why there'd always been long lines despite the high price. You get what you pay for. WOW!!! I ended up buying 2 more. The taste is indescribably DELICIOUS!!

Something is missing.
The water ? The milk ?
They just don't taste the same as in Japan.
Skip. Must try in Japan... not here.
5
Had to queue as it was a public holiday but well worth the wait. Well baked crisp pastry and delicious light, smooth, baked cheese-cake style filling.

The cheese tart were superb, the pastry dough is crunchy and tasty. There's no queue anymore. We came back twice for this delicious and expensive cheese tart :)

I really like bake cheese tart in here, must try if go ro ion orchard, very delicious, i cAn eat 6 pieces, must try!

This outlet is located in the basement of ION. Each person is allowed to purchase max 12 tarts. Quite pricey but totally worth it.

The cheese tart here is a far cry from those you get in Japan.
The cheese taste is flat, unlike in Japan, they used good quality Japanese milk.

The tart is good and taste even better after put into the fridge, it can turn into like a cheese-ice-cream. But the que is quite long and the service speed is a little slow. I only tried once and never go back again.
起司蛋挞还算好吃，不过分甜腻，放入冰箱冷藏之后还更好吃，像是吃起司冰淇淋，但是每次去都有太多人排队，有些要排上一两个小时才能买到，也是觉得有所不值。不过我买的那一次人不是很多，尝试过后也没有再去买过了

We originally confused this with Hokkaido Baked Cheese Tart, which is by Secret Recipe from Malaysia. Bake is actually from Hokkaido. The queue can be long at times and the outlet sells a few thousands tarts a day. It is expensive at $3.50 per tart but fortunately it was a tasty treat. We enjoyed the mousse-like filling and cheese flavor wrapped around by crispy baked pastry. Best of all, each was freshly made

Didn't know why there was a mile long queue for this Japanese import and am I glad that my curiosity got the better of me. Wasn't impressed after the first bite and one turned to 2 and then 3 and voila I had to stop myself from eating all 6 :)The thought of the soft, creamy texture of the melting cheese is making me want to head back to Singapore / Tokyo as soon as I bloody can :
5
I'm Amazed with the softness of the cheese, first bite make me Can't say anything. Not to sweet, just proper taste although the queue length. Before i go back I bought another one to bring home. I keep on fridge also still good.For sure will be back and easy to find.

The best cheese tart so far that I have tried. Not too sweet and so rich! I have bought 1 pack- 6pcs at SGD20.
5
Theres really not much to say about Bake other than they have the BEST Cheese tarts I've had. And Ive tried a lot of cheese tarts.
5
The best cheese tarts! Was queue for less than 30mins to get it and we bought 24pcs as we have 2 person. I love all the 3 type of eating this cheese tart when freshly baked, in freezer and also when it get cold.

This takeaway shop is in the basement of Ion mall at Orchard. We were early so lucky to reach when there were no queues. They sell only cheese tarts and in one option only. The tart is perhaps the lightest and most fluffy we ever had without being too sweet. Even the base had the right crispness. I believe that the base of the tarts are flown in from Hokkaido every morning. If you're on Orchard in Singapore don't miss this

Latest in Singapore's food fads is Bake Cheese tart, it has not only inspired other bakeries to come up with similar looking product (emphasis on the word "looking") but also amasses crowds that make you wait anywhere from 15 mins to an hour to pick a few of these babies (there is a cap at 12 per person). They are double baked tarts (the crust is first baked once as a biscuit and then with the cheese filling all over again). Available at the hefty cost of 3.50$ per piece <I do think its over priced>, bake has tarts that have you coming for more (preferably at lull periods and smaller queues).I would state this though, the mini tarts at Pablo's is far more superior even with lesser number of cheeses in the filling, its crust, takes the cake! (pun intended

We happen to be there when it's lowest peak, after we joined the queue, it was very fast less than 15 minutes for us to get our hands on those amazing cheese tart. We just bought two to satisfy our cravings and for me to have a first mouthful of the amazing cheesy tart! If you have not tried it before, please do so and make sure don't crush the tart
5
We visited the Orchard outlet. To get our hand on the tart, we queued up for 30 minutes. However, the tart was worth our time. The tart was perfect.Furthermore, some other bakery shop selling their tart at the same price as Bake which I think is ridiculous. It makes the Bake looked a bargain.I heard the queue of Bake at Westgate are fairly short. You may try your luck there

The tart is just great - smooth cheese topping baked to perfection in a crisp flavourful crust. The service is poor. They're rushed and "doing you a favour"! The process is inefficient. Please bake more tarts to meet the demand or soon there will be no demand if you leave customers waiting even though they pay an exorbitant $3.50 per tart.

We went early to avoid the long queue and was successfully able to buy this delicious cheese tarts. The cheese tart was very great. From crust to the filling. It is not too sweet nor cheesy. It has that perfect mixture. One person can only order 12pcs max. Also, you can order by piece or by 6 pcs. They put the tarts in a box if you order 6pcs. Anything below 6 pcs would be in a paper bag. It was so good we are already planning to buy again soon
4
We went around 10.15am and there is already people in the line waiting to buy the tarts. I waited in the line for about 20 minutes for my chance to purchase the tarts and each person can only buy maximum 12 pieces of the tart. The cheese tart itself is nice but in my opinion i think it is a little pricey at 3.50 per piece
