I've tried eating waffles in lot of places but most of them flatten the waffles too much and dont make them crispy and fluffy.But Createaf waffles is class apart. They remind me of the Belgium waffles you get in London.Best part is that they make the waffles after you place the order so its freshly prepared and yummilicious!I've tried the following and all are yum yum:Plain waffles with maple syrupBanana chocolate with Vanilla bean ice creamBerries chocolate with Strawberry ice creamI've also had their Chai Latte and its so very flavourful.This cosy place is definitely a must visit for waffle lovers

4 of us came to use our Entertainer apps deal that Sunday evening. No other visitors except us in the Restaurant. Ordered our waffles, no complaint for the waffles and ice creams. I would give an 5 of 5 rates if it wouldn't be because they refused to give us small plates to share the waffles.My friend went to the counter and asked for plates, the staff said Don't have, my friend pointed to the stack of plates near her, and she replied, oh we Don't give. Sigh.Hope they can improve their service better next time

Recently went there. It has a great ambiance. The waffles are pretty good too! Had their ice mocha and it was up to my standard. It's good to go there to relax and chat with friends. Also, the place is quite easy to find. :) Recommend to try it out! :

It's a very casual ambiance at Createaf, you seat yourself and order and pay at the counter. The place is cheery and the service very friendly. We ordered the Vanilla Frappe, Plain Wafflle with Maple Syrup and Butter, Plain Waffle with Salted Caramel Sauce & Macademia Nut Ice Cream. The Frappe was creamy and yummy - not too sweet and just the right amount of caffeine. The waffles were light and fluffy and delicious. The caramel sauce could've had a teensy bit more salt, but the ice cream was terrific! They have both half and full portions, which is perfect if you want to taste multiple kinds. The waffles and coffee here is very satisfying, I'll definitely go back
