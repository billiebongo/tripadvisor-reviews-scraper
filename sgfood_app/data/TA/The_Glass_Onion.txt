The food is not bad and price is reasonable. The white/red wine for happy hour is only $9.00 and normal price is $11.50 which is still alright. Overall experience was good and will consider to come back here again.

We hit on this place after being very put off by the prices in some of the restaurants near to where we were staying. This was a TripAdvisor recommendation and all in all it was pretty accurate. While the restaurant lacked a bit of ambience, it was busy enough with diners. Not surprisingly, few were drinking alcohol, as we have found out since arriving, this costs a lot in Singapore. Still we had a couple of beers and some wine but the size of the wine was really disappointing. I realise that this is the norm here but frankly there is no justification for so little being served. On top of everything else there is a compulsory service charge, which in this case was fine because the staff were good. The Glass Onion gets the thumbs up from us, for the food anyway

Service by Edmund was friendly and he recommended a number of dishes, including the onion rings. These are sliced from a fresh onion and then deep fried and were delicious. The only drawback, if that can be said, is that the dish comes in one size and it can be a tad too much if you are a single diner.I also ordered the salted egg yolk chicken burger, which was pretty tasty too. The buns were just right, without being too soggy, and the salted egg was not too salty as well. The curry leaves and sliced chilli also bumped up the overall taste.The eatery is easily accessible via the Bencoolen MRT, and the Arts Museum is just across the road

Drove by The Glass Onion last week and made a mental note to check it out. It's in an odd spot, at Bencoolen Street (opposite 30 Bencoolen, a hotel). Parking is at the back lane, parallel to Prinsep Street btw. Nett nett, doesnt scream convenience if you are driving. Back to the review, the office bunch usually get stuck on where to lunch on a daily basis, The Glass Onion popped up as a suggestion (from i wonder who?) and off we went.We arrived at the tail end of the lunch crowd, around 115pm. Place was full save for one table. Modest set up not super fancy. At first glance of place and menu, you might think it's a better Hans.The owner (or owner's daughter) attended to us - she was warm and friendly and, I have to say, her recommendations were pretty spot on.We tried their home made onion rings (her recommendation) and mushroom-infused fries as starters. Onion rings - good, in fact, we wanted to order seconds. Mushroom fries - so so.Three of us had their pasta which was quite satisfying. We had the zesty crab angel hair pasta (recommended - medium spicy and good), tiger prawn aglio olio (colleague finished it and said it was okay) and chicken pesto (my colleague almost licked the plate dry). The other two had the salmon fillet (colleague also wiped her plate) and the seabass (got stuffed-face thumbs up).We didn't do desserts or coffee there and as we were wrapping up, the owner/owner's daughter chatted with us some more and told us that even though they are just 4 months old, they already have regulars and some fan favourites, which she had recommended to us. She invited us back and suggested that we try the seasoned fried squid and the ribeye next time. Mental note made. TripAdvisor doesn't have a 'Good' rating so I've gone with 'Very good'. It's not the 'Very Good' I gave 665 (see previous review) but Glass Onion deserves a 'Very Good' coz I feel we need to support locally owned entities which serve decent food at great value. 5 of us ate for $110 total, that's $22 each (saw a lunch promo but we usually don't bother with those). All of us agreed that there were enough positives for us to want to pop in again. Clearly, that's saying something abour the Glass Onion! :

This is a very nice small place. Phyllis, the young lady owner, is very professional and friendly. The menu is fine sorted, not too large, but there is something for everyone's taste and most importantly the cooking is excellent. I truly enjoyed. Fine furnishing and design, fine atmosphere to be there at any time of the day, if only for a good coffee. This is the place to recommend warmly.I will be definitely coming.Keep on the great work Phyllis

We had a dinner recently at this very pleasant little bistro that delivers as per its philosophy: good, simple and great tasting food. The Ikayaki squid was excellently prepared and cooked just perfectly, the onion rings were very tasty without being overly greasy and the rib-eye was top notch! Some friends had the Zesty Crab Angel Hair pasta and it was superb! They have a pretty good beer list ranging in price from $7-12 a bottle which makes this place very affordable (the wine list is likewise reasonably priced and in my personal view it might benefit from a review of selection - but it's a minor point).The value for money alone should make this hidden gem a go-to place in Bencoolen, but it's the quality and presentation of the food and the friendly staff that makes it stand out !

Quiet and quaint restaurant, perfect for intimate dates or a cozy family or friends gathering (even on a weekend)! Service was good and the food was not bad as well. Prices are comparable to more popular cafes or slightly cheaper. Plus point for all day happy hour for drinks!
