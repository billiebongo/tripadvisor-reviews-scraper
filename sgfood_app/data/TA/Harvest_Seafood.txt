Been here many times that I’ve lost count, food has been consistently good, and priced at a cheap price of $12 nett per pax, it’s really one of the best deals along this pricey CBD / tourist stretch

It may not be common in Asia, but if the menu offers an appetizer, I prefer to get this first and not at the same time as your main course. Especially not if it was asked like that.
anyway, the food was average.

pleasantly surprised with the affordable zhichar set lunches provided here, with good quality dishes. would hate to see this place get crazily crowded or raise its prices, but i got to give due credit where credits due. would come back again.

Went for lunch and food was fresh and service prompt. Food was cooked the way it should be.
We tried Seafood fried rice, Stingray and mushrooms broccoli dish.
Food was really fresh, prices on the higher side doe to its location.
Good choice.

We had a lovely view from our table by the river. But we paid for it! $0.30 for the wet napkin (which we didn't realise until the bill arrived) and $2 for a tiny bowl of peanuts (ditto). The food was not more than ordinary. $10 for 6 satay didn't sound like terrible value. But when they arrived only 2 small pieces of chicken on each stick. And they refused to supply tap water to drink. The service, particularly from the male waiter, was surly at best. Definitely a tourist trap. Perhaps in the middle of a row of tourist traps but that doesn't excuse it.

One of our favourite places for lunch around Boat Quay. Discover it by accident when a group of us need a place to eat n discuss our reunion plan. We always go for the set meal. At $12 net per person, you would get a soup, prawn and vegetables and another dish (there are more than 10 dishes to choose from). If you have more people, you can choose more dishes from the menu. The menu changes every week, although some of the more popular dishes would appear more regularly. We usually prefer to sit outside by the river. In general, the food is good, the staff are friendly and we have a great view of the river.

It probably is not that important where go you for a drink in Boat Quay, the most important thing is that you visit this pretty little part of a Singapore. The river has a fair amount of activity going on it and we decided to pick a location towards the centre of the Quay area because this is where water taxiâ€™s come and go from and you can see either end of the Quay with all the comings and goings of the people strolling about. Harvest Seafood offered reasonably priced drinks and we were lucky to see a couple of the classic spiced crab dishes coming out to diners from the kitchen. They seemed to enjoy them but as mentioned earlier, it is the location here that is the reason for the visit, but do stop somewhere for a drink

I like Harvest. Sea food at best beside the river. On average 4 person can cost about 200-300 bucks, which is pricey but not if u consider having dine out at boat quay.I specially love their big and white prawns (even though I am allergic to prawns) The only thing I would want improvement on is their service. That is something on which they must be attentive
5
At $12 nett for a soup and 3 mains with a bowl of rice, it really makes you wonder how this establishment survives. Well thankfully, it appears their real target is the dinner crowd, and attracting the lunch time working crowd to join their following with affordable meals is one way to go. 3rd time here, and definitely not the last

Eat elsewhere! The menu looked good with similar pricing near by. We sat down and ordered drinks with the (mostly uninterested) staff. $18 for a Singapore Sling that tasted like sugar water. No Happy Hour either.We ordered spring rolls, hot plate beef and fried rice. Food was okay but definitely nothing special. The bill came to $110 SGD for 1 entree, 1 main and two drinks. Also included was 60c for each wet towel and $2 for table peanuts, ridiculously over priced and left us feeling ripped off. Would not return

I celebrated my forever 28th birthday at the above with Super fresh seafood and also relatively fast service
4
The place doesn't look like much. But they do make the best pepper crabs I have ever had.
I have been there twice now. And if it was not for the ridicules high price. I would come more often.

Very surprised on reading the mixed reviews, but you can only take as you find and our evening meal was very nice. Having been down to the water front we were wondering along Boat Quay looking for somewhere to eat, numerous restaurants along its length, various cuisines, all touting for business, well it is a tourist area, and decided upon the Harvest.Although it is a Sea food restaurant, and obviously specialising in such, we're not really fishy people but plenty of alternatives of the menu.Really nice location, we had an outside table by the river, nice views of the river, and a pleasant place to have a meal and people watch.We ordered 3 meat dishes, special fried rice and a noodle dish, all of wish were very nice, the price seemed comparable with all the other restaurants in the vicinity.Though that said they did charge for what we thought were complimentary peanuts which were brought to the table whilst we looked over the menu.All in all though....a very nice meal, nice location and river views, perfect place for watching the world go past in an evening, would recommend......

Well not something amazing but still it was great. The tastes i tried were very nice and the service too. Obviously the area is set as for tourists so do not expect 5 star attitude and service along with product quality. But it was a nice choice.

Prepare to be ripped off.We liked the look of the satay sticks that looked very nice on the menu outside but don't expect to get anything like the picture, what we got was 2 tiny tough bits of meat on each stick, couple of rubbery slices of cucumber and lukewarm satay sauce. Of course the rice was extra so was handwipe that was sitting on your placemat when you sat down. And to add insult to injury, the little dish of dry peanuts they put on your table when you are reading the menu is added to the bill. So after paying $70 we went in search of some decent food

CROOKS!I must have been served the only crab known to man that was born and didnt develop a body....just legs...NEVER eat here!!These people think their customers are fools.Presented with a bill for "half crab" and a mediocre bottle of wine at Sing $470 I threatened to call the police.The bill was promptly reduced to S$400.But frankly is utterly outrageous for a meal of this quality in a retively expensive city as Singapore is(US$300). I have worked in over 60 countries over the last 30 years. This is as completely ripped off as I have ever been.I will be pursuing my case with the Sing Trading Authorities. This sort of extortion should only go on in books.Its not what the Authorities here would want Im sure.Its only a one star rating bacause a zero seems not to be possible...DISGUSTED...

Looking for the rights place to eat on the Boat Quay is not that easy. There are a lot of restaurants that are pushing cheap beer just to get you in. Not so with Harvest Seafood Restaurant. We got there early for dinner and found a table right at the bay-side, with a wonderful view out to the city. The staff are very nice and helpful, and even - when we came back 3 weeks later - helped me find my favorite dish again: spicy Singapore Laksa Soup! Yes, it is a little pricey, but if you manage to sit outside with the view, then it is definitely worth the money. The food is very good as proven by the fact that on our first visit, the outside terrace was filled with a British expat group celebrating a get-together

Our experience of Harvest Seafood was obviously better than quite a few reviewers. We walked the whole Boat Quay strip before settling on Harvest Seafood, partly because at the time they didn't have a spruiker trying to suck us in, partly because the menu looked like what we were after, and also because the riverside position was perfect. The menu does take a bit of scrutiny to understand, but essentially the big ticket items like crab and lobster are advertised by price per 100gram - so when we ordered our Chilli Crab we were given the option of 1.5kg or 1.8kg - we chose the 1.5kg to share, which was logically 15 times the $7 per 100gm that was advertised. The other dishes seemed to be priced quite 'normally' and we enjoyed a seafood Singapore noodles and some satay sticks, Tiger beer and Apple cider The Chilli crab was great, and I would happily recommend this restaurant just for that. The big plastic aprons that are offered are a must, but you are also well catered for with a moist towel and a finger dipping plate each. Some of the staff had no English, but anytime there was a communication difficulty it was referred to those that could help
5
We had a wonderful escape from the crowds and noise of Singapore sitting at a quay side table watching the lights reflected on the inky water and slowly eating our way through a delicious chilli mud crab each. We were thoughtfully wrapped in huge plastic aprons which kept the mess off our clothes, as eating crab chilli crab is a very messy business. We were able to choose the crabs that we wanted from the selection of live crabs and were told the price based on their size before they were taken off to be cooked. They were superb and we thoroughly enjoyed slowly savouring each morsel
3
I ordered what the menu said was $35 but what I got was $112 of Chili Crab. Very tasty, messy, but too expensive. Makes me think the $35 one was the size of the Crayfish.Be careful what you order here. They don't explain well and take advantage
2
we had evening meal, location good but pricy, the price list was misleading. I didn't like the way they disappeared with my card for 10 mins...... Boat Quay is a good area to eat, I would avoid this place
1
Food was very nice but prices deceptive and exceedingly expensive . Beware
They also put nuts and napkins on the table and add them to the bill
3
My opinion is similar to most others here. Average food and ridiculously overpriced. I was actually stunned when I saw the bill. And what was really cheeky is that they even charged is for a few peanuts they put on the table!
4
The place is like any other place on Boat quay and the people are very nice and helpful.
The food is ok and not too many vegetarian options but nice place to sit and enjoy the evening !
5
Here the Black pepper crab has been the best among other restaurants at the Boat Quay. Really the most delicious. And service has been without any concerns. I would come back here:)
5
Really delicious, service is perfect. I recommend this place definitely if you are interested to try a crab. It's worthwhile to go.

Served an outstanding crab this evening. Perfectly prepared, tender meat. Expensive dish but a great final dinner in Singapore. Wonderful view of the waterfront at night.

If you walk down Boat Quay, you'll encounter plenty of seafood restaurants promising good food at reasonable prices. That's not always true. The spot is popular with tourists so the restaurants here are essentially tourist traps. Harvest Seafood is actually quite pricey as the portions are small and the dishes are just good and not great. But it's inconsistent. Some dishes are good and some are just acceptable but not particularly outstanding. That would be okay if it wasn't so costly. What you get however is a nice view of the Singapore river.
2
Seafood restaurant near the river is very expensive. We try Srilanga Chilly crabs cost SGD 126 (1.8 kg), the taste was not nice as expect..its.really.sweet. We try a few things including Singapore noodles, garlic bamboo clam, Seafood salad and Calamari, everything tastes so so. The bills cost SGD270, comparing to taste..it is expensive

We passed this restaurant whilst walking along the river front to a bar we had spotted earlier, and it looked so good, we decided to eat here the next night. What tempted us? A great menu (mind you, most of the sea-food restaurants along the river front at Boat Quay have much the same menu), friendly and seemingly efficient staff, and reasonable (for Singapore!!) prices. So how was it? In a nutshell - the food was OK, but the service was dreadful. The waiter came to us the instant we sat down, with the wine list and asked us what wine we would like to choose, even before we opened it. A meagre selection of vastly overpriced wines - virtually all priced at Sg$ 80 a bottle with a few priced a little higher. I'll pay a lot more than this for a good wine, but on a value for money basis, we ordered beer!!The waiter took our order, and as soon as he took my wife's order for starters and main course, he walked away, and placed her order with the kitchen. I had to ask the waitress who brought our beer a few minutes later to send him back to take my order. He was very apologetic, but - how difficult is it to realise that only one of a couple has ordered?And you can guess what's going to happen next - the kitchen treated it as two separate orders, so my wife was finished her starter before mine arrived. My wife's main course arrived not long after I got my soup (hot and sour soup - delicious!) and then, when I still had more than half of my soup left, my main course arrived. The waitress who brought it just couldn't understand why I asked her to take it back, and not to serve my main course until sent it back, after I had finished my soup. But there's more, and it's not any better! My wife having ordered rice with her prawns, had to ask for the rice to be served, and despite her having had her prawns served long before I got my main course served to me (Black Pepper Crayfish) my rice arrived before hers. So both of us ended up eating food that had pretty much cooled off. I saw some others send dishes back for being served at the wrong time too, although I have to say that most tables seemed to get their orders served in a satisfactory way. The food Itself was OK - and perhaps it might have been great, or really great, had it all been served properly at the right time. It's not as if they are unused to serving Europeans as opposed to locals, as this very busy river front area of restaurants and bars services far more tourists than those from Singapore. The waiting staff on duty on the night clearly had no idea how to serve food - their idea seemed to be to collect one plate at a time from the kitchen, take it to the table, put it down and walk away and do something else. No concept of timing, or serving dishes together where appropriate, like vegetables with the main course. There are better places along the river front, which are less expensive, and which have waiting staff who actually understand how to serve food to customers. Such a pity, as I think the Chefs probably cook pretty good seafood, but it was certainly spoiled for us, by poor service. I won't be going back. Ever! HGM

Came here with a friend, good atmosphere over the weekend. Very busy. Good selection of beers and cocktails. Good prices, especially on the buckets.
5
Great food and great service. Had spicy or chili crab, fried fish, oysters, king prawns, and shark fin soup, but the champ was the steamed bamboo clams.
5
I've been to Singapore and eaten chili crab and pepper crab before but Harvest is the place I've always been looking for without knowing it! Fantastic! Incredible! Excellent service! I will eat at Harvest every time I come to Singapore from now on!

We had a farewell dinner here before leaving Singapore. We chose this place on the water where we could watch the boats. The atmosphere was great. The food, however, was quite expensive and the service was very slow. it took 45 minutes to get our food, which though good, was not worth the price! We ordered one chili crab and one bowl of pineapple fried rice to share and the bill was S$187. Because they charge by the weight of the crab, we were unaware of what the charge would be until we got the bill. It was quite a shock!
4
Slightly more pricey than the restaurants in land, but you are paying for the location here as it is situated on the boat quay. It was hot eating outside as there weren't any fans turned on therefore with a hot soup we soon felt ourselves melting. Never the less the food was great and the service was very good. Our meal and drinks totalled $329 which includes a napkin charge.
2
Average food and the service was not good. Felt we were being hustled and rushed into ordering and the food was average. My wife ordered sea bass but the pricing structure was not explained to us. In the UK a sea bass portion is fairly small. Instead we got a 1kg piece of fish which cost $100 and was not particularly well cooked or presented. When challenging this with the management they stated the waitress had informed us of the pricing (they had not) . Overall I would recommend you avoids this place

Ok, Clarke Quay is a tourist rip-off in general...We spent 30 SGD each on food you can get better at every Hawker for 5 SGD.Save that money and get a drink at MBS, Raffles, etc. instead.However, the view is nice if you have a table on the water

called in for a meal with friends whilst attending a conference in Singapore. After initially have a cold beer at Harrys Bar we walked along the street where we spoke to the sprinkler and looked at the menu which all appeared fine and reasonable priced,Enjoyed a nice table by the river and ordered our meals. Asked for a couple of starters being; calamari and spring rolls. Spring rolls okay but calamari was horrific. Beer arrived and was poured into warm glasses. Ordered; seafood noodles, beef in black bean, chicken and pork and eggplant clay pot. All dishes arrived at different times during our meal with the chicken arriving before the starters and noodles arriving after everyone had finished.DO NOT GO HERE- much better places to eat. Too expensive and only interested in ripping off tourist who think getting Singapore experience. Go to a hawker market for good food at reasonable prices- not here
4
I was there for dinner with some guests and their prices is on the high side for Chinese restaurant but still reasonable compared to their neighbors. Wine is $80 a bottle onwards, expensive for a non premium wine, Satay a dozen is at $16/18. If you must dine by the quay, this is one of the best place to be

We found this restaurant by accident & we were very happy we did. The Harvest Seafood CafÃ© is located at Boat Quay along the waterfront. The location is terrific if its a hot day as the breeze is very soothing & relaxing. A waterfront table is a must. We ordered the crab & it was absolutely delicious. It wasn't cheap but we found all restaurants expensive in Singapore. Overall : Excellent service, good food & nice tablecloths in a fabulous location
