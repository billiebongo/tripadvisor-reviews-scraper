We were in Singapore for vacation visiting Arab street area. We came upon Mik's inno outlet (cross road between pahang and Aiwal street) where we have our dinner. it is a family operated outlet. Food is fusion (western and asian) and with good choices. The prices is reasonable . i had chicken wings and my wife had cheese salmon, both are excellent choice
