I went there with wife and sister. They serve quality cakes and we just loved it. Prices are quite high but worth it.

Service here varies .. depends on crowd.
Cakes are average... ok only. Nothing special at all.
I have tasted much better in Singapore and overseas.

I've always been a fan of French-Japanese desserts so I just couldn't miss to try this restaurant in Singapore. Though their original (vanilla) flavour is their best seller, the chocolate mille crepe is a must try too.

I'm a regular at their Westgate branch, I love the fast and friendly service I get there.They usually have a 2 cake set promotion, so it's great to share that with a cake loving friend. I love trying out their seasonal cakes, sometimes it's a hit and miss.Would come back again

A place for tea with nice cake. After our lunch we were thinking of having something sweet and at the same time celebrate my dear friend birthday. May be the timing was 3plus in the afternoon there wasnâ€™t much crowd. Good time to sit down to relax and at the same time a cup of tea. I loved their cakes which is not so rich and staffs were friendly and they were kind to provide me with a candle on the cake too. I loved the environment very cosy.

Waited for the longest time for it and it's finally opened. The New outlet at South Beach.Very bright and pretty cramped space wise. Felt pressured to finish because it's really small and people are waiting for their turn. Great that the standard of the Mille Crepe is still good. If you are looking for a leisure afternoon to while away your time, thus is not the outlet to patronize

My family and i visited lady m at Orchard Central. Though the queue was long but moving fast. Well managed by the staff. I must say kudos to all the staff there. Managing difficult customers are not easy let alone short manning, from my perspective. To all Lady M staff, thank you very much for your hard work and thank you for the service

Chocolate Mille was rich yet not too sweet, cream was smooth yet not oily.One does not need to doubt on the texture and softness of the multi-layers of crepe.Match with Chamomile Tea to bring out the richness and smoothness.This makes a wonderful afternoon tea on a quiet weekday

Was so surprised to find this in Singapore -- I first was introduced to Lady M's strawberry mille cake in their location in New York City across Bryant Park. I loved it and have been wanting to revisit but never had an opportunity to go back. It's at a great location by the pier in Singapore and four of us share a slice which was perfect amount to cap off our dinner. We got the traditional one as they did not have the strawberry one in stock. Definitely check it out even if you aren't a dessert person, because it is very light and mildly sweet. Price is a bit high for desserts but worth at least a try once! You wont regret it

Came to Orchard Central outlet 4 times and had take-away 1 time. So I can say that my verdict is quite fair compared to the ones who just came one time. Here what I find MUST TRY : *Their Signature Mille Crepes, I could taste the slightly chewy texture of the crepe, the melting-delicately-inside-your-mouth cream, and the hint of caramel... Gorgeous!! *The cakes match perfectly with their English Breakfast Tea. *Mushroom Soup, I could taste its intensely flavoured, bursting with beautifully earthy flavour. Here what I find worth trying too, +The Lady's Benedict, which was actually an Eggs Benedict was quite decent, in fact it's better than some other eggs benedicts in cafes serving brunch in Singapore. +Chocolate Mille Crepes,It's pretty, it's fluffy, and it's quite good. Hubby liked it, said it's the BEST mille crepes so far. +Checkers and Strawberry Shortcake, were equally good. But don't try these, -Very Berry. -Banana Mille Feuille. -and the Coffee Their service, judged from my several visits, ranging from average to poor.

Got to try couple of their cakes and all of them were really good.. the best being their Mille Crepes and Japanese Shortcake...Will definitely visit this place if I happen to be in singapore
5
Arguably the best mille crepe cake I ever had in my life. here in this shop. There are a lot more for you to choose from here, but the mille crepe cake is a must-have. Seriously.

We went to the restaurant beside Merlion.
Tried their famous Green Tea cake, it's very good!
And the restaurant itself is nice also, only thing is the service is a bit slow.
5
Breathtaking view of the Merlion while you sit down and enjoy the best cake in town.
Great place to escape the heat while you bring your friends to visit the Merlion.

The first Lady M in HK went crazy when it opened in July. I couldn't bear the long line. So we just had to try it in Singapore. There was still a line, but a relatively shorter one. The cakes were absolutely delicious. Definitely worth a try. However, the service could be improved. The waiters/waitresses seemed understaffed and stressful, running around all the time and responding very slowly to us. One of them looked rather distracted with a really sad look on her face. I hope nothing bad was happening to her that day. When we asked for a second piece of cake after being surprised by the first one, she forgot to put it in the order. So we waited for a very long time until it was all sorted out

You wonder why people would bother to queue for this miserable cake when it's fails to live up to the hype. Except for the nice interior decor I do not find anything nice about the cakes there.You will be better off having cakes at any other coffee joints than at lady M. Once is enough.

Location: great next to the Merrion. Deco: very simplistic. Poor acoustics. Very difficult to talk to even the person opposite you as the whole place gets very loud. Coffee: bitter (espresso) = something is wrong. Either too quick brew or improper grinding. (latte milk froth was too watery.)Cake: (chocolate mousse with sponge). Ok, you can't really go wrong with a chocolate cake. It was ok. Price: it's Singapore. Nothing is cheap. We won't be back.

Saw tripadvisor sticker so decide to have cake here. Just in front of the merlion so the location was fabulous but I wish I've never step in and gave out my money.I spot their wifi so I asked for the password but they said they don''t have wifi service here. Ok...The services were bad But understandable since it's Singapore, that's what I thought until I paid my bills and have to wait for loooooong time to get my change and I saw the server mostly chatting or playing with their phone. Only got the cashier work after I stared at them for long time.It really left bad taste on my trip. I actually want to recommend it since it's near merlion and indoor but with no wifi and pricey menus, I think you better try out other cafe for your own good

This review is for the outlet at One Fullerton next to Merlion Park. But the cake came from the same brand and same kitchen ...I was attracted by the chic set up and walk in for a closer inspection of their cakes. Spotted my favourite cake, Mille Feuille aka Napoleon, and just couldn't resisted. I should have just walk out. This is the worst Mille Feuille I have ever had. The layers of pastries are wet. The suppose fresh cream looks heavy and it's starting to separate. I feedback to the waitress and get a shocking reply that maybe the cake should be store in the refrigerator. I wonder now where they store their cake? Regardless how others rave on about their signature cake here. I personally will not walk into a Lady M confection ever. Once is enough. I would like to confess that I finished it for two reasons. Firstly, it was passed my lunch time and I was really hungry. Secondly, it costed me $10.60 including service charge. *note: I carry the slice of cake to my table and I weren't serve water and given napkins like the others. Now I can only pray that I don't get a stomachache from it. Hahaha!

We went there just for a dessert after dinner and their signature crepe cake was delicious! There was a choice of green tea or their signature vanilla flavour - I went for their original vanilla flavour and was not disappointed at all. Apparently, the cake is made laying one crepe on top of another and it had a really interesting texture and taste. The ambience was also very nice and white - literally. But the cakes are not cheap, about S$8+ a slice. Would definitely come here again!

Very crowded. Limited menu. The mille crepe is not bad but a bit too creamy. Drinks are a letdown. Unique payment system through mobile.
4
Went there one afternoon after a long day running some errands.
I ordered their green tea layer cake and some checked-pattern cake.
The layer cake was perfect. As for the other cake, it was alright.
Will go back, to try other cakes.
5
known for their mille crepes in new york, this place really knows how to make & layer the crepes right. had the maccha mille crepes - not too sweet, soft spongy crepe & fluffy creme in between. it's worth the $9 tag.

Nice cakes but terrible cup of coffee (diluted and not hot!), ordinary atmosphere and poor service(waiters wore old sport shoes, can not describe cakes!, and the place run by young kids) . Well, we won't go back.
5
I have to say their cake and coffee are pricey but it's fantastic. The view and decor was nice and comfortable. It's away from all those noisy chinese tourists and can enjoyed a lovely cup of coffee / layered cakes
1
It's the place for you to chit-chat or make a selfie snap having a high tea but do not expect the taste of their dessert much, though the price is very high (S$9++) but the taste is less.

I had to fly all the way to Singapore to finally try this signature dessert in this very cute cafe and bakery. Very nice selection of cakes. One thing, you can order the cakes to take away but not the drinks.

Lady M Confections - another confectionary combining the tasteful techniques of creating French-Japanese blend desserts - is located at 6 Raffles Boulevard #02-103 Marina Square Shopping Centre, Singapore 039594 and the telephone number is 6822 2095. W henever I passed by, I was always intrigued by the snake-long queues, never understanding what the fuss was all about, but at the same time very curious to try whatever everyone was lining up to eat.So today I finally had the chance to step into this spacious, sparkling white cafe for tea with my buddy Sidney*. The place was lovely, like a snow palace and the gleaming tabletops were actually cold to the touch.So I ordered me a slice of Lady M Confections' famous Signature Mille Crepes cake - twenty pieces of paper-thin handmade crepes layered with ethereal light pastry cream and gently caramelized on top till a light golden brown. The texture was light and yet resplendent of the crepes' gently sweetness. The hints of golden brown caramel "skin" added a burnt-sugar kind of raw flavor to the dreamy taste of the crepes cake. This was an indescribable beauty, I could have eaten another slice.For more detailed information and photos, please visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/tea-time-at-lady-m-confections-marina.htm

Came here after lunch for some dessert and a coffee.The cakes are really good. I tried the Banana Mille Feuille, and though it was very creamy, it didn't feel too heavy. I enjoyed it.My friends tried the Tarte a la Mange, which they rated very good as well, and the Checkers which, unfortunately, looked better than it tasted.The coffee is really great. Rich in taste and aroma, worth every bit of the $5 I paid for it.I just really didn't like the layout of the place. It's too simplistic, so much that it borders on plain & tasteless. Boring tables and chairs are set out across an unimaginative white floor, walls are as naked as a newborn -- not even any adornments to coincide with the upcoming X'mas, and only a coffee bar and desserts counter borders 2 sides of the place. The experience here can be literally described as enjoying some great cakes and coffee in an abandoned warehouse.But just for its food, I'll still say it's worth patronizing. Good food in an "abandoned warehouse" can be perhaps, a novel idea anyway

Seeing the shop front, I was skeptical as you could neither tell what it's about or what it was serving...but the small crowd around the semi-hidden cake counter had me thinking.We ventured in and we were not disappointed.I'm a foodie and have had the best of cakes from Singapore to Bangkok, Sydney, Melbourne and most importantly, Japan.Lady M has the nicest Mille Crepe I have ever eaten. It's light and creamy at the same time.The Cheesecake has a dense and smooth texture that I really like. It's Rich! And that's the way I like my Cheesecake. There was an eclair, and I would avoid it. Checkers Cake was very nice too!The price was a bit high, but I think it's COMPELTELY WORTH IT!We're so lucky to have this in Singapore (the other 4 outlets are in the US - 3 in NY, 1 in LA
