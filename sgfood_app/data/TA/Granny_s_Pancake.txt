Loved the freshly made pancakes with generous filling. Usually I would love the peanut crumbs filling but when I had the grated coconut one, it was refreshing and tasty! They have 3 flavors: red bean, peanut & coconut. I loved all 3 flavors because they used good quality ingredients. They are great for breakfast and tea snacks.

I was at looking for breakfast and decided to get breakfast for my colleagues in office. I bought two boxes of the following:- Peanut: The pancake is slightly thick and the peanut filling falls out of the pancake when you lift it up. The peanut filling has peanuts, sesame seeds and sugar. Not bad.- Coconut: The same pancake mentioned earlier and orange coconut shavings. The coconut shavings is cooked with red jaggery sugar, which the coconut filling its orange color. I liked this more than the peanut offering from this stall. Try it!They have stalls at hawker centres across Singapore, including Toa Payoh and Ghim Moh, so you need not travel all the way to Ang Mo Kio to try.After I passed the pancake to my colleagues, they commented that they like what they ate. So no complaints from them!Recommended
