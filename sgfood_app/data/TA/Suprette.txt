The burger is delish! So is the breakfast...which are the only things I ate at Suprette! If you're staying at the hotel, make sure you don't miss breakfast.

Yum! Delicious breakfast, great burgers and very friendly staff who made us feel at home - this was the best part of staying at Kam Leng Hotel :)

Nice atmosphere, excellent chunky size burger, good service. If you want a nice sit-in experience this is a solid choice

I love their Suprette burger. It's the best I had ever eaten. Besides that, the place is tiny and cosy, but can be a little too noisy sometimes (depending on the clientele). Reservation is highly recommended on a weekend.

For the homesick Westerner who has had his/her fill of Chili crab, nasi lemak and other Singaporean delicacies, look no further than this little retro gem. Its specialities are burgers, which are a good-size portion with chips and different toppings (cheese, bacon, etc.) When we were there, it also did macaroni and cheese. It's a good place to take the kids or if you are chary of 'local food' before flying out, try one of its home comforts. It also has a good range of drink

People so amazed with Suprette seem to be mostly burgers lovers. We haven't tried their burgers but were forced to have breakfast here because we paid for the hotel with breakfast included. First, the breakfast selection is incredibly limited - don't wish for a breakfast buffet, there isn't any. Secondly, whatever you do choose, you have to pay extra for coffee or juice, and in terms of food, you can only choose from like 5 dishes only. They are all very heavy on meat so if you're a vegetarian like me, you'll be really struggling. And thirdly, when you do make up your mind, half the things on the menu are not even available!Staff is not polite at all, which is a surprise for Singapore where I generally found very friendly and nice customer service. Suprette is an exception.When we are in Singapore again, I'll definitely avoid both the Kam Leng hotel (where rooms are ridiculously tiny) and this adjacent 'restaurant'

Background- Small cafe situated in the nostalgic Kam Leng Hotel @ Jalan Besar. Not the easiest place to get to but nearest MRT would be Farrer Park on the North East Line and a 10 min slow walk. The place doubles up as a breakfast place for hotel guests. Food- The Suprette Burger during lunch is excellent with crisp, buttered buns and a juicy, flavourful patty. If you fancy more meat, try the Heart Attack Burger during dinner (which also includes a free flow of very good shoe string fries). Pricing- Not entirely cheap even during lunch as the basic burger alone is $20. Top up mushrooms ($3) and bacon ($3). But worth every penny

Went here for dinner 3 times with my cousin ! You have to try the slow roasted lamb shank . The have bottomless fries which pretty much means the fries don't run out ! Best burger I have eaten in my life and the staff are great .Try the local brewed beer :

This is our first visit to Suprette and we wanted to try the Suprette Burger. Unfortunately we found out it was not available after we sat down. So we tried the Chicken Pot Pie & BBQ Beef Sandwich instead. They were both very nice. The Chicken pot pie had a wonderful top crust covering the pan that held big chucks of chicken thigh meat and potato swimming in a cream sauce. If you like cream sauce, this is great. If not, the sauce will overwhelm you. The BBQ Beef Sandwich was filled with a generous amount of yummy pulled beef. As for the retro deco concept, we loved it and reminded us of our childhood days. Would definitely visit again - after confirming the availability of the Suprette Burger

Third visit to Suprette and I'm sorry to say that the initial hype surrounding this hotel lobby burger bar is is a dim and distant memory. The burgers are decent enough if that's your craving but the service is minimal to say the least. We were left with empty drinks, no mention of the free flow fries and no offer of dessert. Even trying to get the bill took 10 minutes. And there were only 2 other customers in the whole place! No one wants to feel so unimportant. So here goes for my first ever bad review. Sorry, Suprette, but this was the second time you've left me feeling ignored. Instead, head to the genuinely impressive Potato Head Folk on Keong Saik

A quiet place with a very interesting happy hour schedule (8am to 8 pm), nice chill- out environment and a tasty signature burger.
5
not only one of the best burgers I've ever had but also and amazing drinks selection. will have to come back for an evening with mates. amazing small distillery brands of whiskey, tequila, etc.

Voted one of the best bars / restaurants in a one of the coolest hotels in Singapore, good trendy crowd. the opening hours seemed a bit odd and random.

Nice burgers and polite service but definitely totally overpriced even for Singapore standards... Now burgers are 25++ SD what is excessive... Sorry guys for the bad review and hope u understand I did enjoy the dinner but cannot recommend the place with such prices!

We had a great low-dinner at Suprette on a Saturday night. Located on Jalan Besar, its in a cool, not yet gentrified, neighborhood located in the lobby of a hotel (which adds to the charm rather than detracting from it). My husband ordered he Suprette Burger, which was really tasty and definitely one of the best burgers we've tried in Singapore over the past 7 years. I had the veggie burger, which was tasty but had a mushy texture. Shoestring fries were perfect -- I love thin fries and these were crispy and yummy. Fries are free flow, although we were too full to take advantage of that or try dessert. Beer selection is good, and I liked the Suprette beer on tap a lot. Service was efficient and friendly, and we had a nice chat with the two women working after our dinner. We'll definitely be back

I had the opportunity to eat here due to free breakfast coupons provided by Kam Leng Hotel during my stay there. I had eaten breakfast on 3-4 occasions and found out the rye toast with scrambled eggs and red skin potatoes are done exceptionally well. Tea or coffee are something I have not much idea. Do visit in the evening as well as it has a dim light atmosphere to enjoy the evening with a beer or two. thanksAbhijee

I've had the burger twice on two separate occassions. It's good. Bun is buttered and toasted on both sides. Patty well rested.The Five Spice Chicken Wing (dinner menu only) was quite good.Had the Shakshuka (breakfast menu only) on the third visit. It was good for me, but then again I've never had it anywhere else.Apple Pie was good. Pecan Pie burnt. The day I had the Shakshuka, next table had burgers with burnt buns. So there can be misses. But the burger has so far not disappointed.This review covers three visits, one solo, two with friends. I had lunch, dinner and breakfast when it was still available at lunch. Mid 2014, Jan 2015, March 2015

A lil high priced yet great portion and fresh. One thing for hotel guests, get coupons from the front desk on selected menus, still great thou. We tried variety of menu here, all was great. Need to highlight to get your coffee hot as we didn't the first time we got. Overall was great

Situated in Kam Leng hotel circa 1927, this establishment mixes the old and the new pretty seamlessly. The hotel has been refurbished with modern lighting and a lift, but much of the old flagstones and smooth old concrete staircase remains. The diner's furniture and decor maintains the old world charm, and has a pretty progressive looking bar in the corner that serves its own house beer.We arrived for breakfast, and the food arrived in old metal plates a la the 60s. The food was as good as it looked - the western omelette was packed with flavour and the sliced bread that came along with it was dense and crusty, good eating even on its own. The french toast was thick and soft, and came with a very generous drizzling of raspberries and blackberries. The latte was great, though did not come with any foam art. We decided that was done on purpose as playing with the foam was more of a recent development and not in keeping with the theme of the diner. Prices were reasonable at sub-SGD15.The food quality and old world charm are good value...if you can get a seat

My friends (two guys) were a bit surprised when I (me a girl) asked them to join to the restaurant in a HOTEL... Then they liked the place, ordered the steak & eggs and love the portion ! I had the Suprette burger, the beef patty was nice and lots of crispy fries. We waited for more than 20-30 mins to receive our order ...

Tasteful, friendly, welcoming. Good service, BEAUTIFUL FOOD, we have had some of the best food we've ever tasted at Suprette and we have been to over 50 countries! Also, it is really reasonably priced. Make sure you check it out.

Mainly went there for breakfast and had to have the French Toast several times -yummo. Try the Shakshuka & the duck Hash filling but very tasty. the steak sandwich for lunch with an Asahi won me

Price was on the pricier side but the burger was juicy so it was all worth it. The chicken pot pie was very good too!

This small diner is in the same building as the Kam Leng Hotel. Apart from the great food here, your shutterbug tendencies will get the better of you as you snap away at the Nanyang style tiles on the floor.OK back to the food. Not cheap by SIngapore standards but indeed amazing quality. They serve them on chicken rice wrapping paper on top of enameled steel plates of old. I had the Suprette burger. You can request to skip the fries if you know it's impending size. The burger patty is done to a nice hint of pink . Not overdone which is what I like in a burger. Maintains the juiciness of the meat.The other item is the spinach with bacon oil and a poached egg. Guaranteed to melt any guilt from when it is presented. A huge bed of spinach comes with it and will satisfy any human herbivore.The chicken parmigiana is excellent as a no-brainer if you are undecided. Love how it tastes. Scrambled eggs are excellent and comes with a choice of slides.Will definitely come here again if I'm in the area.They close at 3:00 PM but will open later for evening

Firstly, the whole place is neat and tastefully decorated. It retains some of the old Singapore feeling.The service was nice, attentive and friendly.I was given sample of their own brewed beer. The taste was pretty good. Only problem was that the beer wasn't cold enough.I ordered a suprette burger set, the patty was pretty juicy, easy to chew. The beef was cooked to just nice. The serving was enough, felt pretty full.My buddy ordered chicken pot pie. Very nice crust and cheesy.Overall, i recommend this place for date and maybe friends gathering

It is a small restaurant / bar / cafe catering to breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks crowds, prising itself on being "compact" and serving comfort food. The service crew is very amicable and helpful, so we took up their recommendation of The Suprette Burger (SGD$20.00) - beef patty, gruyere cheese and fries.It was a huge burger, looking even more tantalizing next to the bed of golden crispy fries nestled next to it. Our efforts to ignore the bread were futile, because it was sweet (buttered), toasted crispy and came with lots of aromatic-tasting sesame seeds. The patty itself was great tasting especialy with the melted cheese upon it; and being succulent and juicy added points to it. Not bad, really, a rather pure taste although it doesnt has the charred / smokey flavor I prefer; and I am thankful its sweet flavor is not obliterated by heavy garnishings of garlic, pepper or onions.I had a Mocha (SGD$5.00) to go along with the meal. No sugar was needed - the thick layer of chocolate sauce at the bottom sweetened the bittersweet, nutty and slightly citrusy coffee and gave it the perfect touch already. I did not even regret that they did not have soy milk today ( my original request), since the original tasted great on its own.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/08/lunch-at-suprette-restaurant-bar-cafe.htm

My friend and I were craving something out of the normal hawker fare so we decided to check this place out. We were the only ones in the bar so we managed to have a decent conversation without the need to overpower ambient chatter or loud music. It was very cozy with attentive staff. The food was delicious! French fries was free flow but we couldn't finish the first serving we had. Overall, this place left a very good impression on u

We stayed at the hotel next door, so our breakfast was complementary from the hotel. However, it was really good. Especially the french toast with berries, one of the best breakfasts in Singapore. My bf got the fruit platter, it was really good as well, with a wide variety of tropical fruits and yoghurt. The first time we both got the american breakfast, with eggs and bacon and toast, but the bacon wasn't really what we were used to. Overall, a good experience, good service (when is not too crowded) and would recommend it :

Suprette is a small little American diner/bar within the budget Kam Leng hotel. It has limited seating but serves delicious brunch. There is a decent variety on the menu ranging from the usual suspects (e.g., the 'big breakfast' equivalent with potatoes, sausages, bacon, eggs, beans and mushrooms) to other delicious morsels like duck hash and apple and raisin pancakes with mascarpone cheese. The food is always well dressed and seasoned, and generously portioned – no matter if it in the form of the crunchy greasy goodness of bacon strips or the crisp garden greens providing a healthy balance to the dish, Despite the limited seating, we got a seat immediately for my party of 4 on a weekend morning. This joint seems to be still relatively unknown and business was slow (meaning seating was aplenty). Service is friendly and the pace is relaxed – so expect to have a slow brunch and wait a bit for your meal. I've heard good reviews about the lunch and dinner menus and will definitely be back for more after my positive brunch experience at Suprette

Yes it's not easy to get too, but if you love funky breakfasts, seek it out. My Shashouka was brilliant & gf's corn fritters with crispy bacon best I've has in sing. Coffee is good, but our short mac's bitter. Come here for breakfast, then go for a 4 minutes walk to Chye Seng Huar Hardware for Sing's best coffee
