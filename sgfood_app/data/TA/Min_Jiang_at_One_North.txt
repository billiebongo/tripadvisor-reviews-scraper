We had a wonderful experience with very delicious dinner asian seafood . The price were a bit overrated but the place is beautiful and staff very nice.

We joined some friends to celebrate a promotion. The food was very good, although having described how they would serve the duck they did not follow it (last course in lettuce leaves never appeared).Further on several occasions we were told something but received something else(how many scallops in this size of serving only to be given fewer). For the cost of this restaurant the service let’s it dow

Like always, the food at Min Jiang was great but the service was sad. When we made a reservation, we were not informed about the special menu. The food selection was limited and thus irritating because we had gone to eat old favourites. They did not even serve the condiments - peanuts that do usually do. Like always though, we enjoyed the wasabi prawns, fried rice, chilli chicken, black pepper tofu, hot and sour soup and the chilled mango pudding- which is my favourite. Highly recommend Min Jiang though I prefer the one at Goodwood park
4
Not remember that they actually charge for valet parking last time. Not expensive but don’t find it practical or necessary since we dine in. All staffs were friendly and attentive however me and my friends finds that the food standard has drop. For example the shark fish bone broth it used to be very thick last time but when we tried on recent visit, it was as watery as normalClear soup. Kind of disappointed. However the asparagus with scallops and mushroom dish very delicious as well as their signature Peking Duck. Cozy environment and most importantly excellent service.

came here for business lunch, i personally think that the skin of the peking duck they serve here is not crispy enough, probably due to a thick layer of fat under the skin, the fragrance is good. They also wrap the duck meat in to the pancakes they serve with the peking duck, which i think made the dish too heavy, the pancakes are rather thick too. The xiao loong bao we ordered came stuck together and the skin breaks when we try to separate them. Overall experience was okay but not as enjoyable as the last time i visited their other restaurant at goodwood park hotel

Arriving by taxi into the tropical garden setting we alighted just outside the colonial style bungalow that is Min Jiang. We were met at the door by the Maitre d who ushered us to our table on the patio. A gentle breeze was blowing on the warm and humid evening. The beautiful tropical gardens were lit and provided a pretty backdrop for our table.Now down to business. This restaurant is famous for Peking duck and although it may serve other excellent dishes it was the PD that we were after. Being only 2 people we opted for the half duck which was more than enough for us.Having ordered and being served our martini's the duck was perfectly timed as we finished our aperitifs.Expertly carved at the table the skin was crunchy and delicious. traditionally served with sugar on the side it formed a perfect combination to start our feast. Soon the duck was fully carved and expertly rolled in thin chines pancakes (crêpes) with cucumber, spring onion and other assorted delicacies. Simply the very best PD I've had outside of Peking itself. The duck is roasted in a wood oven and tender and delicious.Be sure to book as this a Chinese fine dining establishment and the PD is the star of the show, so when booking pre order the duck.You will not be disappointed
5
We often visit here as a family, or with friends every couple of months and the food selection and quality is exceptional, very good and very tasty. Highly recommended and in a nice setting, as sitting outside belies its actual location and feels discrete and private. When we are in Singapore for Christmas our tradition is to visit on Christmas Eve and have a family meal, which again this year was excellent - my only criticism is that you can often feel very rushed and you aren't given any time between courses. On the 24th Dec for example, we were in and out in just over an hour despite several courses and half a duck - the restaurant was not full so there wasn't any need to rush us through. If the pace could be slowed down and managed a little better this would be perfect
5
Attended my friend’s wedding dinner at this restaurant, though there’s only 15 tables, but ambience is cosy and intimate.In terms of food, it’s delicious and portion is just right. I had a good dinner that day.However, parking can be a problem, suggest to take taxi or private hire. Highly recommended to all. Thanks

This hidden gem in the park is one of my favorites from a recent business trip to Singapore. Historical building situated in a quiet corner of the park allows for alfresco dinning with the added bonus of optional table-side air con. Plenty of power lunches going on around us confirmed this was a place to be seen. The staff was warm and helpful when navigating the extensive menu. The tasting menu at lunch was delicious and provided a foray into their culinary masterpieces. I can't wait to return on my next trip.
5
This is a big on the higher end for Chinese restaurants (based on price) for Singapore, but after having dinner here last week, I am extremely satisfied with the overall experience.The half duck was a HUGE portion, very much justifying it's slightly higher price, and the taste was very exquisite and different from other ducks. The rest of the dishes were uniformly good and the service was excellent.Stand-outs (apart from the duck) was the pork short rib, the tea( order it, it's great fun visually!!!), and definitely the xia long bao. We (me, my wife and my friend) consider ourselves 'amateur experts' when it comes to dumplings and we actively hunt for good ones. We were blown away with this preparation - it was very juicy and so so meaty!!!Definitely will be back here
5
A very romantic place with lots of greenery. Their specialty is the Beijing duck, you have to order it in advance. The service is great. All the dishes we tried were very good.
4
Came to the restaurant tonight with family, 11 of us, many for the first time. Had a great time not only the food was great but we were very fortunate to be served Xiao Ping who were very attentive to us and helpful too, come as very sincere and always smiling really made us feel warm and happy.The starter and soup was excellent
5
Top recommendation from the hotel Concierge we fancied Peking duck he said this was the best in Singapore …. He was not wrong!Slightly off the beaten track in a leafy suburb well worth the 10min cab ride from Orchard Road. Wonderful setting in old colonial black & white building.Cooked to perfection in a Wood Fired oven then carved and served at the table the Duck was delicious and excellent value at $45 for Half Duck or $90 Whole Duck. Great service from friendly staff – Best meal we had in Singapore - Highly recommen
5
This is a well oiled operation from the welcome to ordering and service delivery. The confirmation call the day before also queried whether we'd like Peking Duck and naturally I said yes. Glad I did as they had a couple of variations on the theme. Their traditional pancake was well executed. But they also had a different flavour combo best explained by the restaurant I think, but delicious. Crispy skin was served with icing sugar dip, a taste delight. The options for the remaining duck meat included one with ginger, garlic and spring onions, lovely! The four of us also had dim sum and a braised beef and sweet and sour pork. All tasty. Constant pouring of tea accompanied the meal in this delightful black and white. A great experience, smooth and reliable.
5
A friend suggested we go and what a great tip! We pre-ordered a whole duck and what an experience. The chef cut the duck at the table and then we had the duck 4 different ways. Great history and learning experience of the background of Beijing duck. Wine pretty pricey but worth going with it for the overall experience. And the tea, try the tea, a great little surprise on the eyes!!
5
We have been there for a business dinner and enjoyed the best Pekin duck ever, really! The service was excellent and the atmosphere outdoors was magic despite the proximity of the road. Make sure you make a reservation as there a limited number of tables. One negative comment: parking is valet only... Why

We hosted our new year business luncheon at Min Jiang. This place has won many accolades & our expectations were high.Their chinese raw fish new year (lo hei) was just average at best.We ordered their most popular dish - Beijing duck, it was most disappointing. The crispy skin tasted like what you would get from a plastic takeaway box, it was not crackling crispy & a little hard to chew through. The duck meat was bland. The home made flour skin wrap had a rice paper texture & started to disintegrate when filled with the duck fillings. Overall, we would give it a below average rating.The group enjoyed the hong kong style steam soon hock & stirfry kailan with garlic. Overall rating is an average for food & service
5
Went to Min Jiang at one north for Valentine's day dinner with my fiancé. Good ambience, awesome food and attentive service crew. Recommended dishes: sharks fin soup, (I know this is not sharks friendly but it is REALLY GOOD) peking duck, and durian glutinous rice ball for dessert. We will definitely be back again
3
We had dinner here in Feb 2017. Food was reasonably good. Service leaves a lot to be desired. The restaurant does not have a proper reception upon entrance. As we walk to our table, there were a few empty tables with uncleared dirty dishes, half an hour later, those tables are still left uncleared. Interaction with service staff throughout was awkward. For example, staff does not say anything before removing finished dishes from our table, nor before removing teapots for refill. All these are small things, however the restaurant's price point places it in the "fine dining" category, with that in consideration, the service is not up to standard
5
This restaurant will be 10 years at this location. The first Min Jiang restaurant is still at the Goodwood Hotel in Orchard Road.. The difference between the two is that this is located in a two storey colonial black and white bungalow in Rochester Park. Access is via a narrow winding road and there is valet parking but most diners park in a public car park a short distance away. It is in a nice ambience setting, surrounded by verdant greenery and trees.Coming back after a long while, the food is still up to the mark specifically their famous smoked duck
3
Famous for Beijing Duck, service is ok for chinese restaurant but no cheap at all and surprised when I saw my bill !
5
This is our first visit to this place although we had visited the Min Jiang restaurant at Goodwood Park years ago. Had the famous Beijing Duck, liked the way it was presented with the original and Sichuan style wrap plus slices of duck as well. Also like the sauce that came with it, lightly salted and tasty. Especially love the shark fin soup that came with the set dinner that we had ordered. We were supposed to have bake fillet, but due to the break down of the oven, we had the steamed version which we find very nicely done too. Also love the durian Mochi dessert that was served
5
Living in London, I'm always disappointed by the plethora of greasy takeaways and horrible restaurants having no place calling themselves Chinese restaurants. I'm so glad I found Min Jiang in Singapore to take my distaste off London's nasty Chinese food charade (though coincidentally Min Jiang in London near Hyde Park is equally fabulous and about the only few Chinese restaurants in London I would frequent besides Hakkasan and Kai). We sampled a few dishes but the highlight of the evening was the durian puffs - those pungent fruit not for the faint-hearted. My husband bravely attacked it with relish, and then ate more than half of our shared portion! Those puffs are divine!! The pungency adds to the glorious flavour and texture...I'm salivating as I write this
5
I hosted my global leadership colleagues in Singapore recently for our bi-annual meeting. I needed a good restaurant near our office, and selected Min Jiang. I was not disappointed. Due to the number of persons, we selected a package meal that included lobster salad, their "legendary wood fired Beijing Duck werved with Homemade Crepes," steamed garoupa, Kurobuta pork, braised abalone, boneless chicken with ginger flower plum sauce and ended with mee pok noodles w/ shredded duck and chilled creas of fresh mango with sago and pomelo topped with ice cream.The service was very good. All the dishes were good, but the duck was special, indeed legendary. The wines we selected at reasonable price were also of fine quality.The dinner was a hit and my colleagues were very satisfied
5
Traditionnal and excellent duck in a nice, quiet and trendy restaurant. The menu is large, a large choice of chinese flavours but certainly don t skip the crispy duck. The duck is proposed in 2 service, exceptional. The service is good and friendly. Take care, i don t know the standart in singapore but it s expensive. Nice location
4
Min Jiang is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. I returned in July with some business friends.Although we had reserved a table indoor, it was not too warm that evening to sit outside. We ordered a Peking duck and some dishes to share (broccoli with mushroom, tofu with spinach, sliced beef). Overall the food were of a high quality and the serving was just right for the 3 of us.The waiting staff were attentive but not obtrusive.It was an enjoyable meal and I will be happy to return again
4
Some of our friends had recommended this restaurant to us. We had the most delightful dinner here. Wonderful menu. Every thing was freshly prepared, full of subtle fragrances and flavours. Their reputation for Beijing Duck is spot on. Just delicious! Excellent, professional staff. Wonderful location with a pleasing colonial ambience.We thought it to be just a best night out. Highly recommend this restaurant
5
This restaurant is located in a refurbished colonial house in Rochester Park. The outdoor dining is also very pleasant too as you feel that you are in a rainforest.They serve delicate ala carte Chinese food as they use high quality ingredients and the presentation of the food is excellent .I liked the Peking Duck as it was delicious. The duck skin was wrapped and prepared in two different kinds of sauce - 'traditional' sauce and 'Sichuan' sauce.The service was very good too
3
Unique appetizer dish that comes with Lobster, Scallop, Eel and Chicken Dice, home-made egg tofu with crab meat and mushroom in spinach sauce and durian mochi dessert were excellent. Joshua Ng and other crew members provided excellent service.However, the Peking Duck that night was unexpectedly average.Duck skin was not as crispy and the wrap was rather thick with flour taste
5
Very good quality food and exceptional service staff. Hubby and son loves duck but I actually don't eat duck due to a bad experience but I tried the duck and was pleasantly surprised it was not bad at all it was excellent.Thank you Min Jiang's staff for such a lovely and delicious Father's Day dinner
3
Food is average to good. Peking duck is average ... The duck skin has a nice smell and taste... The rest of the Peking duck are below average. Ambience is good. Service is great.
4
The best Peking Duck by miles! (Kilometres).
I recommend that you go in a table of 6 or better, that way you can order more the great dishes.
3
Recommended by a friend who frequents this place for business lunch. Tried the Peking duck - it's ok, no big deal to me. The other dishes is ok. Ambience is good. Cost $70 per pax. You try it and see if you like it.
5
Had dinner with a group of friends at Min Jiang. Service was efficient and unobtrusive. Food was excellent both in presentation and in taste. Couldn't have asked for anything better.
4
Is my favourite dish in the world, and Min-Jiang does a very good job of it. The first serving includes a fair slice of duck as opposed to other places which go the all skin route. The second serving was also very good, albeit small due to the amount of duck in the pancakes. The prawn in milk is also fantastic.
5
This is an old favourite of mine - which allows me a delicious treat every time I go to Singapore. A short walk from where I work brings me down North Buona Vista Road and a quick cut up through lush greenery to Min Jiang's Rochester Park restaurant. The restaurant is housed in a Colonial bungalow and its great to eat an early meal outside on the terrace - eating well cooked cantonese and sichuan specialities - and listening to the birds in the shrubbery. Exquisite starters, wonderful chicken dishes and the house speciality of Beijing Duck with eight different condiments. Every trip seems to provide better and better memories
5
It's really hard to fault this restaurant that I've been coming to for years. Their food is great - right up there with the best Chinese restaurants in Singapore, and the service is consistently excellent. I used to visit Min Jiang in Goodwood Park Hotel before they opened in Rochester Park - and it was always a treat to go there. Now that this restaurant is more local to me I frequent this one - and the ambience is entirely different - and better I feel.Peking Duck is their specialty but almost everything I've had there is top notchIf there is one criticism, I've noticed that they've cut back on the portions recently. For example, the mango pudding is much smaller than it used to be.It's not cheap but you get what you pay for
4
This is a great place to try a selection of chinese dishes. We had the xiaolongbao to start followed by the prawns in wasabi and crispy milk coating. The peking duck pancakes were delicious and we loved the duck with ginger stirfry as well - everything tasted very fresh. The food was good value but the alcohol (like much of it in Singapore) was very pricey
5
A nice place to taste great chinese food in Rochester Park in an old cottage converted into this restaurant.Excellent service and courtesy. Food is just great from the typical wood fired duck to fried prawns and scallops to fresh crab served in different tasty ways.
4
We ate here as a group and received a table on the second floor. It was very cozy and I was pleased that the air conditioning was working properly and air was moving well. Of course, in Singapore there is a risk of being vastly uncomfortable, especially on the second floor of an older structure. The courses came out consistently and each was very impressive. I was surprised a bit by the chicken dish, which was a bit chewy, but the rest was fantastic. The seafood was really great. The servers were attentive and kept our wine glasses filled. I would dine here again for sure
5
Well known for its Peking duck (which my group of 6 enjoyed), we also ordered melt-in-the-mouth wagyu beef cheeks and a a super-tender pork loin along with other dishes.
4
If you want to get a traditional Beijing duck, this is is a good choice. Also the desserts have been great. However, it is quite expensive (around 100 sing Dollar per person)
5
In one word: perfect. Food, service, all excellent. Don't miss the Beijing duck. It's really nice. Real Szechuan flavors.
My favourite Chinese restaurant in Singapore.
5
We had a great dinner including Peking Duck. Very good food and very nice and friendly service. We will go back here next time.
5
My husband and I visit often (maybe a little too often!) And absolutely love the food, ambience and the staff. Great good great service, what more do you need? Keep it up Min Jiang!
5
Invited here by a local couple and the food was wonderful. It was the end of the New Year so we were able to enjoy the traditional Yu Sheng dish, tossed and eaten for good wishes for the year ahead. Food expertly ordered by our friends including the famous Peking Duck and all delicious - a real treat to enjoy authentic Chinese cooking
5
Although this restaurant has indoor dining facilities I believe the outdoor section is much more pleasant and welcoming. We had excellent soup followed by a great prawn dish. The restaurant is rated in the top five Chinese restaurants for Singapore. I think the rating is well deserved and especially recommend the lightly smoked duck and other items that are put through the smoker.I recommend Min jiang and plan to return there for dinner
5
The food here was superlative.....our Concierge at the Shangi-La Hotel told us about this restaurant when my husband mentioned that he like Chinese food! My husband had Peking Duck, which they served beautifully at the table. I had sweet and sour chicken. Everything we ate was beyond anything we could find here in the US. Worth the trip togo to the restaurant
4
Visited for my boyfriend's birthday dinner, special recommendations are the Peking duck (everyone knows), chef goh's starter platter and lobster noodles! Do note that while the menu states the cost of some of the dishes by per-serving, you can choose to order one serving to share, in that way u will be able to enjoy more variety of dishes! One such example is the chef goh's platter ($25 per serving), they can cut everything into half. While the experience was lovely, I felt that the dessert should have been complimentary for birthdays (many mid/top restaurants do that), considering we ordered so much food it was a pity to see the dessert in the bill.
4
Had lunch with a couple of friends. The set meal was good value for money. Service was pleasant as was the ambi Nee. Parking is a little inconvenient. Plenty of corporate types at lunch. If you work around the area, good place for a business lunch
4
This is a good choice if entertaining corporate guest for lunch around Biopolis. Reservations for table is recommended and there are two tables upstairs if you prefer some privacy. The Beijing Duck is strongly recommended as well as its Sichuan hot and sour soup.
4
The food is very good...dumplings, rice and the Beijing duck. It's expensive, but it's a really good and quite place.
4
A modern Chinese restaurant famous for its Beijing Duck. Foods are superb, while I like the decor of renovated mansion surrounded with woods. Service is OK (I don't expect so much for service at Chinese restaurant...) . Not so pricy compare to other famous restaurants in Singapore. Worth visting
3
We visited Min Jiang several years ago whilst in Singapore and were excited to return on our recent trip. Unfortunately the food was not as good as I remembered, and no where near as good as Min Jiang, London (we are frequent diners there).Our 1/2 duck was bordering on cold and just didn't have a lot of flavour.Unfortunately I'll be looking for a new venue for Beijing Duck in future
4
Outside the normal city area, this is a good place for business lunch. In a colonial bungalow, it is nice. The old wooden floors and no private rooms does mean lunch cannot be too private though. There is Peking duck, dim sum and braised fish. Food is not bad.
3
Located in a two-storey old colonial house in the green surroundings of Rochester Park, this restaurant provides a nice and unique ambience for Chinese cuisine. Food is only average yet pricey so this is more popular for business meals and functions. It is also good for a leisurely afternoon high tea of dim sum if you want to get away from the city
2
I have had lunch here a couple of times and it was good, hence my selection for a corporate dinner. Sadly on this occasion, very disappointing. The Peking duck was good, but the rest of the courses were nothing to write home about. I was also a little shocked by the bill. Chinese tea for 16 people was s$128. A few not so great pickles on the table for which no one asked s$48. The soft drinks and beer also came s$496. I guess I will not be going there again, as I have no issue paying for great food and reasonable prices for tea, but really, not a great feeling, even a day later.
5
Took my two teenagers here to experience a real Peking duck, they had previously been skeptical but by the time the dinner was over, they were enchanted. They learned how to prepare the little pancakes from our waitress who was patient and genuinely eager to teach... and it made for a fabulous evening
4
We had a great food experience here, A multi corse buisness lunch which i am glad to say i did not have to pay for! There was a hot a sweet pickle delicacy on teh table while we waited for first course which was a delight.Whole Duck served two ways was great, chef sliced small slithers of skin off of the duck at the table which was eaten after dipping in a sweet powder (icing suger?) the Duck was then taken away and brought back ready wrapped, one traditional with Leek or spring onion and cucumber the second with radish, both delicious, ,al lother dishes we had wer eall great vegetables etc. cooked to perfection
5
No, not cheap at all. But this was some of most enjoyable Chinese food I have had in decades. It did have the feel of food cooked with the place in mind rather than the label. Scallops were perfect and so were the other dishes. I over-indulged on the wines, which was my problem. Clearly popular with locals who know. Attractive rooms, good setting.
3
We had a set menu, so the usual starter, soup, fish, chicken, veg, noodles, desert. The food was on the bland side but ok. Overall, nothing exceptional. Service was good.
5
I had dinner here yesterday .
Food was really good.
I had the pecking duck, spring rolls and dumplings.
I'm Italian I can recognize good food
I will certainly come back
Thank you
2
Very expensive restaurant and it does not comply with the food and service!
The only good thing about this restaurant is the Duck...
All the rest is very expensive and it does not worth it!
When i saw my bill i was shocked.
4
One of my favorites in Singapore. Consistently good food- everything cooked just right, especially the vegetables. The best hot n sour soup. Love the old house.
5
Love their Peking duck. Try to get a table outside to enjoy the garden view and airy-ness. The food never disappoint me. Been here many many times and still love it!
5
One of the best peking duck in Singapore. I went to Beijing shortly after the visit to this restaurant, and I must say the Peking duck here is comparable. A must-try!
4
The restaurant is an outpost of the Goodwood Park Hotel, tucked away in a colonial bungalow surrounded by lush tropical gardens. It's so tucked away it could easily be missed and even our cab driver had to be guided by our local friends with whom we were having lunch. Given Singapore's heat and humidity I hesitated over whether to eat outside, but the terrace proved to be large, very well shaded and pleasantly cool - eating there added to the ambience. The service was professional and attentive, but I'm never sure why fine dining service always tends to be lacking in warmth and smiling faces. Our local friends rated the food at about 7 out of 10, but my wife and I very much enjoyed it, especially the Beijing (aka Peking) duck. This is served in both the Beijing and Szechuan styles which makes for an interesting comparison. The wine list is extensive if pricey and the overall cost is what you should expect for
3
We had booked a table for dinner at 7.30. We were served water and then waited 40 minutes before a waiter responded to our call. As I had booked the Peking duck. we were expecting to have been served before this. The waiter expressed surprise that we only wanted the duck but by this time we just wanted to eat and get out of the place. The duck arrived another 30 minutes later. we paid and asked the head waiter to please call us a taxi. When I followed him up 10 minutes later he apologised and said he had been very busy. I pressed him and he made the call the cab arriving 5 minutes later.This was my wife's last night in Singapore and I had hoped to treat her to a nice experience,Tables with large groups were being served quickly and efficiently. I recommend go with a group and not as a couple
4
It was the second time we visited my husband and myself this restaurant, each time with an other couple of friends. Everything is excellent and the Pekin duck a must. But this last time my girlfriend and I had to visit the restrooms just before leaving. I went to the one near the entrance, she went to the one one floor up. And there.....disappointment for both of us. None of them were clean, both bit smelly and far from what you could expect from a restaurant this level. Hope the kitchen is kept cleaner.Still rate the restaurant very good for the food, would rate 'poor' for the restrooms
5
Visited this restaurant with my holiday chums, nephew and friend. He was our tour guide while in Singapore, and fab he was too. This restaurant was even more fab, food was fantastic and seemed to be totally unlike food in the UK. My nephew picked all the courses and never missed the spot with any dish. It was not until we were finished that we realised we did not have rice or noodles, and they were not missed. Just wish I had this restaurant as my local. We also had two bottles of wine and a very large gin each
5
this is one of our favorite places in Singapore.
outdoor seating, excellent food, friendly services.
outstanding Peking Duck ! A must . . .
4
...this seemed to me like a very good meal. Enjoyed the (lengthy, multiple course) set menu for a business lunch, starting with the excellent Peking Duck, and going through a variety of courses, including delicious sweet and sour soup, lemon fish, pork belly, and ending with durian mousse.The restaurant is within an old Colonial black & white house, and the staff are friendly and courteous. Parking is a little limited, but there is a valet service
4
We recently dined at Min Jiang and recommend it. It is located in a beautifully restored black and white colonial house with an Art Deco style Chinoiserie overlay. The restaurant looks like it could do with a bit of a cosmetic tidy up and is showing its age.The restaurant, located at Rochester Park amongst other similar colonial house, is, however, really quite evocative. We sat on the covered veranda overlooking the garden.The food and service were terrific. We really enjoyed the Beijing duck - but the piece de resistance was the pork â€“ simply amazing
5
I had lunch with my son and daughter in law in Min Jiang on 1 January 2015. We had half a Peking duck for which the restaurant is famous together with some tim sims. The duck pancakes were served in 2 ways - traditional and Szechuan style. Both styles were good. The tim sim pieces were of a higher quality than most in Singapore.The staff were very courteous and attentive. They even offer a spare chair for ladies' handbags. It was very relaxing to eat in a quiet and green environment
4
This restaurant is worth going to. We enjoyed the set meal - which was really more of a tasting menu - but felt the building is looking a little tired and in need of a lick of paint. At these prices (it is not a cheap venue) they can easily afford to invest in their building
4
Been here many times in the past and have had good meals here. Today had a large event for 70 people with tables outside under a canopy. It was quite nice with the rain and breeze. The multi-course meal started with the Peking duck which was ok. The sweet & sour soup, fish, vegetables , fried lemon chicken and red bean dessert were kind of blah. It's probably not fair to compare a mass production with an intimate meal, hence my rating took into account the many other meals I've had her
5
As a vegetarian a Chinese restaurant in Singapore that offers a decent vegetarian range is unusual and welcome. To have one with really good food for everyone including my carnivore friends and in such a relaxed and natural setting makes it a gem. The service is polite considerate and flexible. If you like Szechuan food, this is a must
5
This is one of the best kept secrets and hidden restaurants in Singapore. Known by the locals but relatively unknown by the tourists. Book well in advance and also order in advance your Peking Duck. They will serve both a spicy and non spicy version. You can have a table at the veranda or inside. The atmosphere is very relaxed and all the dishes served are outstanding. A great place.
4
The duck isn't what makes this place great - there's lots of good duck in Singapore. Whilst the duck is excellent it's the fact that this place is in a beautiful old Singapore 'Black and White' house with the 'jungle' part of the outdoor dining area that makes this dining experience truly one of my most favourite in Singapore.Make sure you order your duck in advance (24hrs if possible) but if you give them 3-4 hrs you'll likely be ok.Cab drivers will have trouble finding it so show them your iPhone map to help.Enjoy
4
If you don't know the place, no chance to enjoy a remarkable chinese cuisine. Lost in the back corridors of the lobby, the place has little charm, but a good cook that's for sure. Selection of fine -and thin skin- dim sun on a trolley like in HK, a truly delicious pepper beef, a tasty hot&sour stop, a superb very simple sesame chicken made us a very enjoyable brunch by the pool. Another lead: 2 services passed by and only asian customers...Stop by, you won't regret
3
This restaurants location is perfect and the view is perfect too however the food doesn't have any taste at all and its very surprising that it still manages to exists in London where theres a lot of competition but from what I see its subsidised by the hotel.I would not recommend Min Jiang
5
Seven of us enjoyed an absolute feast at this beautiful spot in Singapore. Every dish was of a really high quality in fact I think it is just about the best Chinese food i have had. There were too many great dishes to pick out one favourite but the lobster on the chefs selection, the bean curd/crab and the crispy eel stood out. Of course we also had the duck, ordered 24 hours in advance
5
Having lived in Rochester Park I have a particularly emotional relationship with the Black & White houses there, so perhaps I am biased; but this is a gorgeous location for an excellent restaurant. Min Jiang never disappoints, serving not only delicious Peking Duck but a wide range of traditional Chinese dishes. The crispy eel is a great hit with our children. The mapo tofu is excellent. Do remember to book as it can get full. I should add that none of the other restaurants in RP are as good, and their prices can be eye-watering. Along with Din Tai Fu, this is a consistent winner. Highly recommended
5
Don't go here and not have the duck!!! Absolutely delicious Peking Duck two ways. Then Duck Fried rice to finish. The Prawns were also first rate. My only complaint that for two people the duck was too much to be able to try other things, best to go with a group

My wife and I re-visited the Min Jiang at One North Restaurant in June 2014 to celebrate my birthday as well as to cure my longing for Peking Duck :))It was our third visit to Min Jiang, our previous visit being quite some time ago. We ordered a half Peking duck, fried mushroom, a prawn dish and fried rice with duck meat. The Peking duck dish has crispy skin and tender meat. Overall the food was of a high quality and we enjoyed all the dishes we'd ordered. Service was good and attentive.Car park in this area is quite restricted so we ended up parking at a serviced apartment block nearby

I know very little about authentic Chinese cuisines but the food at Mon Jiang was exquisite, a delightful combination of flavours, aroma, textures and balance. The Peking Duck rocked! Sitting out on the verandah of an old colonial bungalow, surrounded by thick greenery....almost forest-like with select trees picked out with lights in the dark provided for beautiful and almost surreal surroundings. Was it expensive? Yes. Would I recommend it? Absolutely. If you are not well versed on Chinese cuisines, may I suggest you throw yourself at the mercy of the waiters who are very knowledgeable and helpful. Happy times

We were a group of 5 at Minjiang this week for dinner. This was my second time at the One-North outlet. The Peking duck was very good but not the best I have had. The handmade tofu wtih mushrooms and crab meat was also very good. Service was good except that the waitress forgot our first order of the white asparagus with crab meat but it was no issue as they were mainly pretty attentive the whole evening. My only 'complaint' was that we were charged $10++ for a small bottle of still water. Compared to a high-end Italian restaurant that we recently visited that charged only $7.50++ for a 1l bottle of San Pellegrino, this seems way way overpriced

Set in a lovely place among trees, quiet and elegant, this restaurant offers a mouth watering sechuan food. Not too spicy, you can even ask the chef to be gentle with the chilies.The outdoor sitting is extremely pleasant and service very good. Perfect for family or a romantic tete a tete

We had a nice CNY dinner with friends here. I don't think the food was amazing, but the service was really friendly and helpful considering we're not too familiar with Chinese food or CNY traditions. Ambience was ok -- we were not able to get a table outside, but we were given a nice corner table. Years ago, I had a CNY dinner with a group outside and it was much better. Also, maybe 5 years prior we had dinner there when my brother and sister-in-law were visiting. If my memory serves me right, the Peking Duck was much better then. We lived nearby at the time of our last visit, but I'm not sure we'd make the trip out to return again

This is a really average restaurant. The place is nice because of the location inside de 'woods' in Rochester but that comes with the mosquito bites. There were Mosquitos even inside. The food was average for the price. There is much better duck in other restaurants in the city for a much more affordable price.
4
Dinner for six at 510 euro total... The duck was excellent, and so was just about everything we ordered. Also, try the dim sum, it's great!
5
Located in the lush Rochester park. Very nice Szechuan dishes. Our favourite is the Bejing Duck, you have to order one or two days in advance. Nice place!
4
Visited this restaurant in a small group.
Quiet atmosphere. Great service. Crispy Duck (with pancakes) was great. Also recommend the diced chicken with pepper
5
This restaurant was recommended from our friends living in Singapore. A delicious place with a lot of Chinese meals and perfect service. A good selection of wines. You have to try a selection of meals to taste the typical Chinese food.
5
Joined ten friends to celebrate 40th wedding anniversary. Great ambience, excellent service and wonderful food selection. The old colonial setting took us back to when we all lived in Singapore very nostalgic.
4
Was there for dinner with some colleagues. We had the Peking duck which was delicious. The best Peking duck I had ever tasted. The place is a bit secluded and not overly large. It was a cool evening and we sat outside. It was quiet enough for discussions and yet it had the Chinese restaurant feel. Perfect!
5
This is the best Pecking duck in two ways that I have ever had. The other dishes and food was also outstanding. The noodles were very tasty also, so was the crab and the almond milk desert. The locals I went with said that this restaurant has the best Pecking duck outside of China, so must be onto a great thing! The restaurant had many other positives. The colonial setting was charming. The service was very attentive and professional. The ambiance was nice as the restaurant was busy but now overcrowded. The tables were reasonably spread out so you could have a normal conversation without needing to speak louder than usual or attempt to hear the conversation. Also, because of the general restaurants in the area, it was reasonably easy to get a cab there and back without waiting for a long time. Very happy to have visited this restaurant and would love to eat there again! 
5
This is the newer location, amongst the black and white colonial houses in Rochester Park. A bit hard to find, but really nice setup and amongst some new and trendy restaurant bars in this area. We pre-ordered the duck... I rank this amongst the best I've had anywhere. The steamed sea bass in soy was also superb, as were the other dishes. Indoor and outdoor seating, superb service, a really great experience. I don't think you'll be disappointed in any way

We went for dinner to Min Jiang, having had a disappointing experience at another Chinese retaurant. We must say that it was very much worth the trip. The restaurant is situated not far from Orchard Road in the Goodwood Park Hotel. From the little we saw of the hotel there appears to be an older part and also a more modern part of the hotel.Our experience from the time of booking to leaving was very positive. The restaurant is a long, thin room and was very busy on the Monday evening we were there. We started with the Pekin Duck, which was beautiful. As a previous correspondent has suggested it melted in our mouths. We followed with a chicken and pine nut dish and a prawn dish with a garlic and chill sauce, together with rice. Everything was excellent. Staff were extremely pleasant and helped us to decide what to order.Good selection of wine. A very good evening and we would be very happy to visit again
4
They have a lunch promotion, $35 for 4 courses or $38 for 5 courses which is a good deal either way. It's "degustation" style and everyone gets their own classy servingWe started with a platter/trio of dimsum and it was good, especially the carrot cake and dumpling. Next was the chicken soup and it was a healthy broth. The perch was silky smooth like cod and tasted great. The crispy noodle was good, a little spicy. The dessert of pandan with ice cream was refreshing. All in all, good value for money, a decent lunch portion and rather tast
5
Invited by a local friend to dine here. My party were all vegetarian and this was by far the best non-indian meal we had in Singapore. The noodles were superb and the tofu dishes were just perfect.
4
Lovely atmosphere, felt like a family home. The food was nice and the service polite and helpful. Take the staff recommendations on food and portion sizes!
4
A wonderful restaurant in a small colonial building in a green environment. The cuisine is chinese and excellent from the service to the food. The wine selection also fine.
5
Went here on one of my company's lunches and it was fantastic. One of the best Peking Ducks that I have tried in Singapore. It's SGD98 for a whole duck and I must say it's really worth it. The skin just melts in your mouth. There are various wrapping methods and they will offer to wrap it for you. A must try wrapping is the garlic one. Absolutely killed it
4
We went with friends and really enjoyed the setting of this restaurant. It was nice to sit outside under big lush green trees and enjoy a delicious Chinese meal. The peeking duck was delicious as were the dumplings, fish and vegetable dishes. It's not inexpensive but had lovely ambience and food. Attentive service too. There's equally good food all over Singapore but this restaurant won't disappoint if you are looking for a lovely setting and an outdoor venue

Having had Peking Duck at one of the best duck restaurants in its namesake city, Min Jiang certainly rates as a peer.Based on a "request" from 2 friends returning to SG after having moved back to Australia after 5 years in SG, we gleefully went to Min Jiang expecting something special. We were not disappointed.Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor, I was somewhat concerned about the level of service. The fear was unfounded, with the service excellent.We had the obligatory "pancakes", followed by the remainder of 2 ducks, between 4 people which was somewhat overkill, as 1) San Choy Bow (in lettuce) and 2) Black Pepper duck. The SCB was up there on my all time favourites and will be ordered again when we return.The atmosphere at Min Jiang was great, with us taking outdoor seating as a 2nd choice, but only just.While it was not cheap at $90 a duck, the overall experience was one worth travelling for as a tourist.I would recommend booking and including a duck order at that time, just to avoid disappointment
5
Had excellent meal here with my daughter who is married to a Singaporean .Beautifully cooked food served at just the right pace duck was skilfully carved and made into rolls there was 12 of us and was plenty. Had several other courses each seeming to get better as went along. This was a pleasure that I will repeat. Not sure on price as did not pay but the food blew me away!! Apparently there is a branch in London think worth a try if anything near as good as this
4
Had a nice dinner here. We had a pre-ordered 10 course chinese dinner menu, but it was nicely done and presented. The duck was nice and the prawns with Wasabi sauce and deep fried in "crispy milk" was delicious. The other dishes were average. Dessert was a mango jelly with bits of pamelo and sago - unusual. Service was on the slow side considering that there was only 2 tables occupied. Not sure how much the damage was as someone else was paying, but it was an enjoyable meal
2
I really wanted to love this restaurant as I live nearby. My family and I were attracted by the lovely garden setting and vintage decor/historical building. However, while the food quality is adequate it is nothing special. Most dishes taste more Singaporean than chinese. The si chuan dishes are not spicy. The duck is good but not great--somehow lacking that authentic Pekin duck flavor. Any true Chinese restaurant will offer "cha xue" free or at a nominal charge. The high prices really do not reflect value for money. Sorry, this is just so so. And, $8 for a bottle of water? Please. There are many other restaurants in the area with better offerings. One highlight was our server, who was genuine and unpretentious. A young lady with a big smile

I like this location way better than Goodwood Park's. It's set amid lush greenery and it's alfresco seating resembles Chinese courtyards of a certain era. Food-wise, it's on a calorie-piling and cholesterol-threatening side. The gong bao chicken sauce couldn't have been thicker and the steam fish gravy couldn't have been saltier. But this is easily forgotten because the entire course starts off with a bang (3 prawns cooked in different styles) and ends with a greater bang (mango pomelo - best ever!).I don't really appreciate their valet parking. It's actually better to park at the multi-story carpark and take a nice stroll down to min jiang

Situated in a converted "black and white" colonial house.
Very nice dim sum at lunch but expensive for what it was.
5
This was a highlight of our trip. Everyone should eat there! The duck was amazing! It is a fair taxi ride out but worth it.

I dined here for a weekday business lunch, and was blown away by the quality of our dishes.Every single item was superb… the best Chinese food I’ve eaten during my two years in Singapore. One of my colleagues is a local foodie who had visited this restaurant previously, and he did all the ordering so that may have contributed to the excellent choices. And I didn’t see the final bill so can’t comment on the value-for-money.But my experience here was fantastic, and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for delicious Chinese food in a unique setting. For tourists staying around the CBD or Orchard area, be aware that this will require a 15-20min taxi, but Rochester Park is an interesting dining enclave anyway… so if make the drive to Min Jiang for dinner you could consider “making the most” of your trip by visiting one of the other restaurants or cafes for dessert or post-dinner drinks
3
Quiet, out of the way, a definite departure from the Singapore norm. The service was fair, the duck was good, but there isn't a cool place to retreat if the heat is getting to you. They have an oscillating fan that helps a little every 20 seconds. The sides were good. We had to go find our waiter to pay the bill. Singapore has too much to offer to go here
2
The restaurant was in one of the black and white bungalows at Rochester Park. Nice place, but spoilt with lots of flies flying around our table, onto our cutleries etc. The set dinner costs $98++ per person. But food and service were below par. Not value for money. Will not recommend this restaurant.
3
Most of the restaurants that were found at Rochester Park offers a very good and quiet environment for dining, away from the hustle and bustle of the cities. As Min Jiang is the only chinese restaurant available at Rochester Park, and my craving for chinese dishes, we went for a try. For environment wise, it's my ideal sort of dining environment. Relax, quiet and comfortable. While we were there during the weekdays, the restaurant was not packed and staff's service was good. We've ordered their signature dish - Peking Roasted Duck. Verdict - I've tried better roasted duck. I wasn't bad and it wasn't very good either, it was on the average scale. The skin was a bit oily and light for me. We've ordered other dishes which is worth the mention - mushroom beef roll and seafood tofu which was good.Overall, if you prefer a quiet dining environment, you may want to consider Min Jiang

New Year's Eve in Singapore was a delight in this lovely restaurant where staff where sowelcoming - we had prebooked their speciality of Beijing Duck and it was terrific. They did not gouge prices as sit was New Year's eve and we would to back again
4
I tried the Min Jiang restaurant with some Singapore resident friends, who spoke highly of the place. I confirm their judgment. Quality of food is outstanding. I don't know much about Chinese food, but this is certainly not the Chinese take-away sort of place. Nice dining room, silent atmosphere, spotless table napkins. The main feature of this restaurant is duck, cooked and served in every possible way. I just let myself be guided by my friends, and the waitress (who unfortunately spoke very little English, making communication a tad difficult). Regardless, the food was simply excellent.Wines are very expensive because of high Singapore liquor taxes, but I managed to get a very decent claret for $SIN85. Total bill came out very reasonable

Was dragged by colleagues to join their dinner at Min Jiang at One North - heard alot of good reviews and decided to taste it myself. We've pre-ordered half of roast duck and add on with cripsy honeyed eel / hot and sour soup(appetiser), chicken with dried chilli, dong po pork, claypot toufu, fried noodle with duck meat , xiao longbao etc.The food is of average quality - I've tasted better sichuan cuisine at a lower price. I do enjoyed the roast duck wrapped up with the new version condiments (Szechaun pickled vegetable etc) - thought it'll taste weird but I find it refreshing and less oily. The claypot toufu and fried noodle were equally good.Dong po pork is avearge (slightly tough), chicken with dried chilli - more sweet than spicy, hot and sour soup - rather tasteless. Xiao long bao - the gracy/soup is tasty but rather tasteless fillingThe dessert were good - esp the chrysanthemum jelly - fragrant and refreshing. Didn't really fancy the durian glutinous ball and red bean pancakeService was good though - always attentive.Frankly, if I craved for Sichuan / Chinese cuisine again - I'll go to silk road or Lao Beijin

Had an excellent meal here, suspect good that I was not paying! Work friends sitting on the terrace whilst tropical downpour going on was really special. Food was lovely, and the Peking Duck, for which I understand this restaurant is renowned was lovely. (although have to say being a heathen would probably prefer crispy duck). ended up full beyond full. As there were many courses, lobster, abalone and sea cucumber (not a fan of this no matter where I eat it), steamed pork rib (probably one I least liked), soup, Ribs and finally the most delicious Singapore noodles I've ever had (although no one in Singapore calls it that! Probably lottery win place, but give it a try if you have cash to flash
5
It's a nice calm restaurant with tasty food, good wine and great service. iw ould go there again.

Must try their famous Peking Duck!
This restaurant serve delicious Chinese food similar to the Ming Jiang located at Goodwood Park Hotel
3
I love the min jiang at the good wood park hotel. therefore was seriously disappointed by this restaurant. On arrival they told us that the duck was not available, the fried rice at a normal hawker place tastes better then here, overall the food quality was extremely dissapointin

We visited Min Jiang in May 2012 having previously been there 4-5 times.The atmosphere is very good given the location in an old English black-and-white heritage house in the Rochester Park Enclave. The food is good but for a Sichuan restaurant, the spice level come across as rather Westernized or at least toned down to suit Singaporean palates. In fact, we typically visit Min Jiang when we get a craving for “London style” Chinese food. The food at Min Jiang somehow resembles what you can get in a high-end London Chinese restaurant. The menu is quite a hybrid with Peking duck, Shanghai xiao long bao and Cantonese dim sum in addition to the Sichuan dishes.Overall a good choice for an upmarket Chinese dining experience in a colonial heritage house

We were there for a wedding dinner. Quite a cosy place for an oriental fusion setting. The food is really wonderful and not forgetting their famous Peking duck. The server taught us how to enjoy the crispy duck skin with icing sugar. We were quite skeptical about it at first but the taste turns out to be so well and I can't help to have another few more servings on that. The Peking duck came with 2 different fillings, the traditional one which is with the cucumber and the sze chuan one which is slightly spicy. I was surprise to see that they served (wrapped) their Peking Duck with the meat, as most of the restaurant serve just the skin. Simply delicious and filling.Overall, this is a cosy and nice restaurant for an out of the city feel
5
We were in Singapore on the busy Grand Prix weekend where our local expat friends advised us to steer clear of the restaurants & bars on the circuit. Min Jiang was the perfect choice for a swish dinner which is housed in an old black & white in a lovely part of town. Our Peking Duck had been pre-ordered and was DELICIOUS served in the three suggested ways by our attentive waiter. We left the choices of dishes up to one of the locals who chose exceptionally well. The setting was relaxed and enjoyable. The bill was hefty and comparable to any well regarded restaurant serving beautifully prepared food. Wine is expensive in Singapore which always bumps up the bill
3
The food here overall is very good. I went here to try the Peking duck but was not overly impressed by the flavour and consistency. The setting is ok if you sit our on the deck but for the price I am not sure I will vsit this place again
5
Based on the title, many will defintely ask where is the best and the answer is Paradise Pavillion at MBFC.However, the Peking duck here is commendable. They served the delicacy in 2 different styles, the original peking style and the Sze chuan style (Can understand since this is a Sze Chuan Restaurant). Like the Sze Chuan style as its more spicy and different. After all these years of the standard Peking duck, it is really nice to have something different. They serve their peking duck the Beijing method, skin with meat and using white flour skin. Most restaurants in Singapore use yellow skins, which is made using eggs and thats why the yellow colour. The white skin is plain.As for the rest of the dishes, most are served individual portioned. The spinach home-made tofu is very tasty and well done, the sauce taste great too. We had the baked Chilean Sea Bass and i would say it taste like cod fish. Its very well done and the meat is very juicy and tasty. The desserts are fine too.The restaurant is surrounded by greenery and therefore, has a very relex and casual feel when u sit outside the restaurant. However, the inside of the restaurant is crampy when all seats are filled up. The outside seats are more romantic and dim. However, one drawback is that you may not be able to see the dishes served clearly and fail to enjoy the food presentation. If you are sitted outside, you can see the corner where they roast their Peking duck

I was hosted upon a lunch by my Singaporean Colleagues at this restaurant. Although located slightly away from City's hustle & bustle, the Hotel seemed to be a favorite place for many food lovers. I liked the ambiance, the calmness & the decor of the place. We tried a 4 course lunch with lots of seafood, a Chinese Flower tea, some excellent Chinese Desserts & a signature Pork Chips dish. Overall, a nice experience. The taste of Chinese food was very different from what available in India. I felt it was more authentic

Sitting out on the terrace in the humid fragrant evening, you can here the grass grow. Wonderful atmosphere, good food, good service. Pricey, but worthwhile. Order ahead for the duck - it's worth it. A real Singapore experience.

Went to try the famous Peking suck cooked in the apple-wood oven, and it was worth the effort to go.

superb Peking Duck!

nice environment, good food :9

Nice environment and good food.

Love their peking duck and mee sua dish.

Good dim sum - very popular weekends.

yum yum smoked duck.. like the ambience tooo.. a pretty chinese restaurants..did i mention good soups??
5
It's my 3rd time here. We pre-ordered a Beijing duck which was great compared with other Beijing duck outside of Bejing. The portion of food here is big enough evenfor Small size. We six people had one duck and 5 dishes which was more than enough. The service was awesome

The crispy duck is a MUST!

the crispy duck is yummy

Finger licking good Beijing duck!

Interesting setting. Yum food. Piquant duck!!

not as good as the one at Goodwood
5
love the diced chicken with macademia buts and dried chilli...so good!
2
average restaurant...no terrific dishes

Oh, to spoil a good Peking duck with thick, doughy pancakes! The uncooked dough smell was so strong that even the sauce and spring onions couldn't mask it. Obviously, the pancakes were bought and not made there. Head over to Lei Garden for a much better Peking duck experience. The ee-fu noodles with dried scallops had the entire table giggling while searching in vain for shreds of scallop. The only dish I really enjoyed was the fried red-bean pancake with ice-cream. Overall, what can I say? Obviously the dishes are of a certain minimum standard, it being a "fine dining" chinese restaurant and all, but beyond that it was a big disappointment
4
the peking duck is eaten differently from usual chinese restaurants, try it
5
not bad but the one in Goodwood is better
4
peking duck and more!
4
Nice ambience, usually quiet and dim.
The food is prepared fresh and the service is attentive. $40 for a half duck that can feed two people.
4
pricey but service is good, uniquely prepared dishes
4
Yet another nice place to hold birthday parties...
3
Slightly over rated and over price! But ok lah!

Worth giving it a try!!
4
Good food, but still prefer the food in places like lei garden and some of the higher end crystal jade restaurants..

Good Chinese food
