Superb dining space and rooftop bar located on top of Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore. You also need to try Wolfgang Puck’s own Sauvignon Blanc wine as it is excellent and as good as any New Zealand Marlborough.
5
By far one of the best restaurants I have tried in Singapore so far. Prices are high but in my opinion, worth it. Staff is attentive. Good wine variety. Perfect especially for dinner in small group or family.
5
The meal was really filling, made very well and the service by the staff was splendid. The lunch menu wasn't overly expensive for the views and location.
5
If there is anything worth visiting in the Marina Bay Sands, it is Spago. Not as expensive as you would expect and the view makes us for more than you pay.

The only thing that let the day down was the staff not enforcing the dress code. Cut off shorts and a scruffy shirt are not suitable lunch attire in this lovely setting and according to the dress code are not permitted. So enforce it. Food was good, beautifully presented and cocktails excellent only the dress of some of the customers let the side down

There are a few reasons it’s not a 5 star review. In truth it’s 3 star but it would be unfair on the staff/kitchen who did perform. One of the most perplexing sights was that the front of house staff are expected to run after tourists that enter the restaurant area behind a rather non descript closed door. People will try their luck of course but I think it’s a bit silly they have to go chasing people and spend the next minute discussing it with a group of lads who knew full well that they shouldn’t go through there why they can’t just wander in. However there is no sign on the door to the restaurant area but it’s still obvious. Back to the matter at hand, the food on Valentine’s Day was a set menu that you were still able to order a la carte from. We enjoyed the burrata with prosciutto, artichoke, almond delight as a starter which was quite exquisite. Washed down with a single glass of Billecart-salmon Rose champagne (S$40++ per glass) just the right amount of bubbles. For mains we both enjoyed meaty dishes of veal chop and duck breast, however we were served the wrong doneness which was fairly quickly rectified with a thousand apologies and extra top up of champagne. We were seated in the terrace(?) area - read the outside corridor that people were walking back and forth along right next to our table when entering and exciting the restaurant area along with the table that took 5 minutes to fix due to the uneven floor. It was a case of a last minute booking being squeezed into the least favourable spot. For one starter, 2 mains and 2 glasses of champagne it came to around S$300. Otherwise S$199++ per person for a 3 course dinner without any drinks you are expected to cough up well over S$400 for a “romantic” dinner. Let’s just say it’s a good thing we didn’t go for the set menu nor on a first date as it was somewhat cringeworthy at some points aside from the fantastic food. Unfortunately it’s a package deal when you go out to a restaurant and you do expect an experience at MBS which was not delivered

Firstly this does have the best Dinner view in Singapore. The food is nearly on a par with the Cut, though still excellent. Great menus, to the extent if being rather spoilt for choice. Formal restaurant (with a dress code that does not seem to apply to everyone) Impeccable service. Certainly recommend, and look forward to returning in the next tri

Being a single traveller its not always easy to get a place in a good restaurant.Here I got on top an excellent table. immediately a waiter - a guy from Bulgaria- made me to feel comfortable. I asked him for his suggestion and the food -grilled salmon- was just fantastic. The service of all the waiters was very pleasant. They seem to care about me, what in such restaurants happens nearly never! After I have finshed this great dish the waiter -another nice guy who had served me my meal- suggested a souffle. Generally I dont like it so much, but he talked me in and what can I say? Coming back I would order it again!!!!Later on the restaurant manager, Aisha Khan, came to talk with me. She has her stuff perfectly under control and apart she has a great heard! She went with me on the terrace to let me see this spectacular view over Singapore from the 56th floor. Its unforgettable.it was a great evening. Even the chef said "hello' and I had the oportunity to tell him that the food was amazing!!!!
5
Stop the 56th floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel, this bar and Italian restaurant has the most breathtaking views of Singapore with the glittering city on one side and the soothing ocean expanse on the other ...The youthful and chic vibes of the place are definitely inviting and yet the food with its limited yet exquisitely crafted menu is a piece of art

Nowadays there are a multitude of opportunities in every city to go somewhere that serves great, if not fantastic food. So when deciding to go somewhere with such a globally renowned reputation, expectations are lifted and more prone to disappointment. I only mention this, as it is important that the staff that works the floor is very aware of this mindset.We dined on a Friday night and unfortunately there were only 3 other tables in the dining room. Of course when it is quiet like that, it even emphasizes the fine dining atmosphere even more, than if it would have been busy with a slight buzz to it.Because there weren't many patrons to look after, the staff was overly attentive, I mean we had 5 different staff introduce themselves to our table within the first 10 minutes of sitting down. To the point where we felt that it was difficult to have a conversation, as we were interrupted on a very regular basis.On the food side we all did enjoy our meals; good flavours, good presentation, good portions.But considering the overall experience, we'd really have to think when to return..
5
Every single time I visit a Wolfgage Puck restaurant, I fall in love all over again! This place has great meats and amazing wine lists. The service is excellent and I would recommend this place to anyone!
5
I have visited, Las Vegas and Beverly Hills, but this Spago in Tower 2 at Marina Bay Sands, is a WOW experience! The views are amazing!! This is definitely a GO to place, if you have dined at other Spagos, around the world.
5
The food was amazing and the service impeccable at Spagos. To top it off the view across the infinity pool on 57th floor across all of Singapore is incredible. Well worth a visit.
5
Excellent food and just nice size. For the price I would highly recommend this restaurant. Deco looks very high class and elegant, especially for business it would be very good choice! Food also tasty and it is highly competitive price compare to other downtown western restaurant. Dessert very good. Whole meal is not too little food but just nice amount and just nice taste on my palate

This was our first experience at a Spago restaurant, and did not disappoint.We arrived early so we could enjoy an aperitif at the adjacent bar and soak in the views and atmosphere atop this amazing structure, the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Once seated, a hostess will take you through to the restaurant table when ready, so we had time to relax and gaze.Within the restaurant, the tables are spaced fairly well apart, yet it is fairly intimate as it’s smallish, and divided into two sections.Reservations are staggered, so the kitchen staff can manage the demand effectively, and we didn’t have to wait long for any of our courses to arrive.Service is exceptional, as you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber, with staff being friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.Food is of the highest quality and cooked to perfection, and the portions are generous by today’s ‘fine dining’ standards. I would certainly recommend either of the mains we had, the black cod or the duck; both were succulent and tender, with an interesting mix of flavourings.And of course the views from this restaurant on the 57th floor are breathtaking, although potentially superfluous given the culinary experience. Nonetheless, to step outside and gaze out to the distance vista is a feast for the eyes, especially having just indulged the stomach !As expected, the experience is VERY pricey, but definitely worth doing ..

Went here with my Mother-in-law on her first visit to Singapore. She is not easily impressed so I thought this would be the perfect place to bring her, and boy did it work! We loved the food we ordered. the service was impeccable. the staff were so attentive and that cheesy potato (forgot what it's called) is soooooo yummy. Everything we ordered were tasty and wine list was excellent. Worth the price we paid for. Place, Staff, and Food were superb. 5 stars

First time in Singapore and we were on a Celebrity cruise ship at the Marina Bay Area. After a day of touring, we wanted to be sure and head to the Marina Bay Tours and we love dining, so thought we'd make Spago's our evening "shore tour" of our own. When we arrived at the tours by taxi, it has just started sprinkling. We headed in, and knew Spago's was in Tower 2, so found the elevators for it next to a small menu stand. You need to know that this elevator does not go all the way up, take it to floor 55 and then when you exit elevator turn to the left and walk straight ahead and transfer to another elevator that will take you to the Spago's level. (This was a bit unclear on the ground floor but we figure it out!) When we arrived at the top, it was POURING so everyone from the pool area, which is worth seeing too, had come in under the overhang. I had to fight a bit to get up to the hostess stand, but thankfully we had made reservations on Open Table in advance or we might have had a tough time getting in on a Saturday night even though it was quite early (6 p.m.) We were seated immediately and the whole evening was like a fairy tale, the room was beautiful! The service was tremendous and they even offered to take our photo for us, which I appreciate! From start to finish, everything was PERFECT! Do not miss the signature tuna cone appetizer! We both had to get the black cod, even though we try to do different things, because it just sounded amazing. My apple salad was a work of art and it was also delicious. I cannot say enough about our perfect evening in Singapore! Luckily rain cleared and we had an amazing view after dinner

Wanted to go to this restaurant for some time. It was a wonderful experience with great food and excellent service but felt a little disappointed. Cannot fault it but I suppose the super high expectations were difficult to deliver. Enjoyed it but we are unlikely to go back. Pretty expensive..

I appreciate that if you’re eating in a restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands then security can/should be an issue. I guess anyone can jump on the elevator to the 57th floor but you won’t get much further than that. We were asked for booking confirmation etc and then admitted to the exclusive pool/bar area. Once our table was ready we were again asked for booking confirmation. I have to say that I was disappointed by the entrance door/gate to Spago. Considering the environment I would have thought that perhaps a wrought iron gate with personalised lettering would have been more appropriate rather than a blue painted wooden gate that one would associate more when entering a garden. There were also a couple of teething problems once in the restaurant. No one wants to sit by the door, so why offer the table? There should be a unspoken rule about this! There were other tables free and they weren’t occupied during the time that we spent in the restaurant.Our table reservation was later in the evening and unfortunately our first choice of lamb was sold out. The bread and butter lacked butter and although we requested more butter it arrived too late.However, our choices of chicken and duck were delicious. Both were very tasty and the chicken was melt in the mouth. We also had a side portion of Brussel sprouts that were just divine. The wine was on the pricey side hence we only had a glass each. The bill came to 250 SGD plus service charge (inc two drinks at the bar). Like I said; expensive, but worth it

My Birthday at Spago, (Marina Bay Sands), Singapore was the best experience. Reynan the Sommelier and Ian the Captain of the Dining Room made the lunch extra special. Their knowledge, attention to details and the exceptional service that they provided made the lunch extra special. The entire staff went out of their way to make sure that I had the best experience. The food was soooooo delicious and the presentation was aah-amazing. The candle in my dessert, the signed birthday card from Spago, and the amazing view added that special touch. The General Manager, Tomas Stoila took time to visit each table to acknowledge the diners and even wished me happy birthday. The entire lunch experience and the customer service was top notch, I highly recommend this award winning restaurant.✨
5
Its a great place for fine dining and the food is simply amazing. The selection isn't much but every plate tasted great. The Stirloin Steak and the grilled Chicken would be my recommendations. A must visit every time you visit Singapore!!
4
A perfectly pleasant restaurant which manages to make little of its 57th floor location. Entry through an anonymous garden gate....Good efficient and friendly service. Tuna cones pleasant but the cones over sweet. Veal chop a very generous portion, well cooked but otherwise fairly plain. Caramel soufflé pleasant. Wine list OK if careful!
2
The signature restaurant at MBS is fully booked several days in advance and clearly can deliver a great experience - but not for us.The dining room was less than full so the kitchen was not overstressed. We ordered a main course only, duck for my wife and prime rib for me. Her duck and veg was excellent and hot whereas my steak was lukewarm and the broccoli hot.I rejected the meal as too cold and was surprised when the waiter said he would 'reheat' the steak in the kitchen- and left the broccoli on the table to congeal and go cold! When the meat was returned about 8 minutes later it was no hotter, the broccoli was stone cold and my wife had finished her meal.The manager came over and apologised and offered to get something else or do something else to "make up for it". I will never understand why restaurants think that a couple would be happy to eat their meals at different times, one sitting watching the other eat, when we book for two, sit together, drink together and order together.Moreover, if one segment of the meal is cold, over or undercooked, or otherwise wrong take the WHOLE thing back and start again! At least that way there is a chance we can eat some of the meal together - but to leave the veg on the table whilst trying (and failing!) to "reheat" a prime ribeye is amateur hour to say the least.A complete failure but my wife's duck was very tender and beautifully cooked and presented so they clearly have the ability but dropped the ball in this case
4
Enjoyed a lovely dinner at Spago. Started with a few cocktails - rough love was good!! Good selection of spirits and wine. For dinner we started with the tuna cones, hamachi and the apple salad. The cones and the apple salad were excellent. In the mains the truffle pasta was the real highlight, the black cod was good but not outstanding. The caramel soufflé was excellent- light and fluffy. Great view from the restaurant and service was great.
5
My boyfriend chose this restaurant for his birthday during our stay at marina bay sands. The decor is simple but elegant, very spacious and not many tables which makes it more private and personal. There was so much on the menu we wanted to try that we ended up ordering the scallop mains as a starter along with the tuna followed by the steak and cod for mains. They offer fresh made bread which was incredible and cheese during course intervals. Our waiter ANKUR was an absolute delight, incredibly helpful and pleasant, we spoke to him a lot and found out he studies in Leeds! We enjoyed the experience so much that we cancelled reservations for our last night to go back and do it all again and of course requested to be seated in Ankur’s section. We ordered pretty much the same but added the gnocchi which I the definition of the phrase ‘melt in your mouth’. The second time around we also met Michael Pekarsky the assistant general manager, he did a great job recommending us a wine and he was very conversational with not just us but all diners. It’s staff like this that make our experience in a restaurant unforgettable. I can’t wait to go back and do it all again hopefully soon!! Thank you guys for such a special TWO evenings!

Chef Wolfgang Puck has built quite the culinary empire. Like Alexander, he does not just conquer but also absorbs some of the best ideas from other cultures. Spago’s, a branch of the famous Hollywood location that hosts one of the best post Academy Award dinners every year, does not disappoint. We had a starter and a main each but had wine left over from the bar yesterday. Bill therefore excluding wine was just over $200 which is not bad considering the view, ambiance, and quality. And if you are worried about being hungry, don’t be. The portion sizes are not bad considering this caters to the haute cuisine crowd which tends to lean toward low carbs and reduced calories.We had a seasonal chestnut and mascarpone agnolotti which was absolutely sublime and as a starter was quite large. There was also a veal tartare which was light and tender but a bit flavourless I thought.Our mains consisted of the veal chop which seemed a touch on the dry side to me although my partner thought it was fine, and the miso cod melts in your mouth. A side order of Brussels sprouts was tender and buttery. Unfortunately they had just run out of aged steak so we missed that option. Our waiter was quite knowledgeable as one would expect, and service was generally good, at least until the end when they forgot to bring our last bottle of water and after dinner teas and coffees took 15 minutes to arrive despite the restaurant being 2/3rds empty at that point.A point to note... dressing up seems to matter in terms of table choice. We saw more casually dressed folks pushed to the back and away from the city view windows which is also where people walking along the pool would look in. So it is possible to not see much of the city. Also, clientele the night we were there were a bit mixed and some tables frankly detracted from the ambiance.But overall a good experience and probably good for business as well as couples
5
We really enjoyed the food and friendly service at Spago. Our Apple, Pear and Cucumber miso salad starter was beautiful and delicious. Our mains were great too, duck, black cod and scallops. Sorbets and salted Carmel soufflé to finish it off. Service was attentive and friendly, and after dinner they took us around back to see the super trees lit up at Garden by the Bay and told us about Singapore. The view from the 57th floor is perfect, and it was easy to make a reservation using Open Table.
5
We were warmly welcomed at the reception, and ushered to the bar to wait while our table was being prepared as we had arrived early. The bar is open-air but sheltered, strategically placed behind the MBS roof top pool to allow patrons to enjoy the view. There was an extensive drinks list, paired with the comfortable ambiance, great for any party. The main dining room was spacious and provided good private space for diners; lights were warm and overall decor and ambiance was comfortable and relaxing as well. Special mention to Ankur, our table waitstaff/host who was instrumental in making sure our night was fuss free and that we were well taken care of. From the careful and personal recommendations of the menu, to planning and spacing the dishes, the service was top-notch. A birthday surprise awaited us at the end of the meal for my fiancée, besides some complimentary sides that were served for our enjoyment. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, each other’s company in this wonderful ambiance, and almost forgot to take these few pictures to remember the night. One of our top few dining experiences by far
5
Had a birthday celebration here. The restaurant is located on the 57 floor of MBS and has an exclusive area just for the dining guest. the view is of course exquisite. Ordered the Kaya Toast to start, which was Foie Gras with Kaya (a Singapore type Jam). The combination was out of this world. It was the best Foie Gras I've ever eaten! Next was the chirashi, which was flown fresh from Japan. It was really fresh. For mains, we had the steak and veal, as recommended by the waiter, and lobster and grits. The meats were nice, but could have been better. The lobster and grits were really tasty and were actually better than the mains. Overall a very good dining experience, with first class waiters and an amazing ambiance - level 57 of MBS, what more can you ask for
5
We recently had dinner here - and I must say that it's a lovely restaurant that's worth every dollar. The staff were accommodating - allowing us to increase our booking of 5 to 6 just before we headed over. We really loved the ambience - and the food was delicious. We had the kaya toast and oysters as starters, my mom had the 'angry' lobster while we also ordered the cod fish and prime steak for 2. The food was top notch. We also had red and white wine recommended by the Spago team - and we loved every drop.We felt comfortable with the lovely team who were friendly and kind, making great recommendations for us along the way. We'll definitely be back :)The Spago burger that's served by the pool was amazing as well - we had that for lunch the next day
5
This restaurant definitely lives up to its expectations. As it should be, this restaurant serves you the finest food you could get in Singapore. Definitely one of the best and must try in Singapore.

If your looking for a restaurant that cares very very deeply about the food, the atmosphere and the love and work it takes to make your evening an experience then Greg Bess, Mike P and thier teams know what needs to be done.We have enjoyed many an evening with these folks and the incredible creations they bring to life. Greg is a master in the kitchen and brings your sense to life in such a way that you rethink what food is and literally beg for more. It's perfection. Mike P brings his style that creates a wonderful atmosphere and a caring genuine touch to really drive home the dinning experience. Incredible food, hands down the best taster menu I've ever had (those that know me I've had a few ;) ). Mostly though it's the people, Greg and team are wonderful! We have had many many nights with many of our friends and everyone agrees hands down; we can't readily think of another restaurant in all our collective travels that meets the standards this team sets. It's really a place that stands out very strong in the world stage. Thank you Greg, Mike and team... We are forever in your debt
5
Tonight was one of our most amazing evenings ever had across the world. The attention to detail, to us and to what we were looking for was spectacular. A very very special thanks to Ian Valoutine, who took such good care of us. Your sense of humor made us feel right at home. Thank you Spago for sending us off “with love

We had a lovely lunch at Spago back in October. To be honest, it exceeded my expectation as I went thinking it would be just another forgettable restaurant. There were some areas that could be improved but it was overall a very satisfying afternoon.We did not have a great start - getting onto the wrong lift and after some exploration finally made it there but was 'welcomed' by a snooty hostess. Luckily things took on a better turn after that. Another hostess who led us to the dining room did an excellent job introducing the place and even showed us the bar and lounge area after the meal. Would love to thank her on TA but her name escapes me.The three-course lunch priced at S$45++ was good. Laksa Spring Roll was crispy and went down well. The tuna tartare cones were alright but my companion loved them. However, I remember seeing it served on a stand of three cones. For lunch it came as two with a hole in the middle and you just get the feeling they were cutting cost and the presentation therefore gave a stingy impression.Main of Iberico pork was tender and fragrant although the sauces were too salty. I had a bite of my companion's Angus burger and was really glad I ordered the pork.Dessert of Pistachio Panna Cotta was the delight of the day. Not only did it taste good, the texture was carefully layered without going over. The orange gelee gave a refreshing taste, while pistachio brittle lent just a nice touch of crunch, and finally the creamy panna cotta round off with such a lovely feel. Unfortunately, an order of a fruit mocktail was way too sweet.Service in the restaurant was very good and the place was elegant and quiet. The view did not wow me too much since there was a walkway between the restaurant and the view but this didn't really bother me too much.I will visit this restaurant again with no hesitation

Took my daughter and a couple of her friends here for a birthday treat.Good food and great service.Appetizer portions are on the light side for the price, but that is now often accepted/excepted in the better restaurants.Enjoyed the cote du bouef.Bring your wallet
5
We ate here on the last night of our honeymoon and were very impressed. The service we received was great from start to finish. We decided to share the cote de boeuf and it was amazing, justifying the hefty price tag. We were shown the cut of meat by the waiter before being cut and served to us at the table. The aligot potatoes that accompanied the steak were also really tasty. We also had the soufflé for desert which again was great, the apple ice cream being particularly tasty. Overall a great restaurant with a great view. Probably more expensive than it should be, but I guess it occupies the premium spot at the top of MBS so can't complain too much
5
Dined here for a family meal. All was fantastic (including the view!). The foie gras, Laska and soufflé were all fantastic and I would highly recommend! All staff were fantastic, and went above and beyond in recommendations, making off menu cocktails and showing us the city views. Would highly recommend!
5
for an anniversary celebration, we enjoyed a very efficient and friendly service from all the staff ; we were 8 , and the variety of food selected , from the tuna or fried oysters to scallops up to sirloin and various meats was very well appreciated by everyone , Presentation and cooking were at top. Don't miss the tuna as an entrée with a beautifull "bateau" wooden support . This restaurant is on top of the Marina Bay resort and its magnificent view over the Bay and is also among my top favorites restaurants over the world quality, cost & service wise .
4
On top of a hotel which does not count with an overwelming service, there is Spago located on the very top. OK. Not cheap at all. But, menues are not the standard ones and for food lovers a nice journey into Asian Fusion Cuisine. We had red snapper, Risotto, Pasta with Pumpkin filling and Mussles. Delicious. Good Service and tableware. Both fitting into that level of Restaurant
5
There are very few places around the world where you can give 5* to all aspects of your visit but the Spago restaurant at Marina Bay Sands is definitely one. We visited with friends and we all had the lunchtime set menu which was reasonably priced and absolutely delicious. Service was extremely good and Tomas, the restaurant manager, did an excellent job of taking care of us. Of course the views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands are amazing but it’s obvious that the restaurant itself strives hard to make the dining experience just as good - and succeeds! Superb.....
5
Beautiful food and cocktails and view from the Marina Bay Sands.
If you're ever in Singapore this is the best tourist thing to do!
Watch the sunset over Singapore.

Visited for my fiancé’s birthday meal in September. The tomahawk steak he ordered was well cooked and very much enjoyed. However, if you are not in the mood for steak the menu is fairly limited. Also quite strange paired sides with the steak - a gooey cheesy mash potato thing that was an odd experience and not exactly one we would like to repeat. However the ambiance of the restaurant is good with polite and attentive staff. I would recommend but perhaps check the menu beforehand to ensure your tastes are catered to.
5
From the minute we arrived I could not fault Spago. It wasn’t overly busy. Service was efficient, friendly and unpretentious.Servings were more than generous. The Waygu gnocchi was outstanding. The salted caramel soufflé was to die for, even the coffee was one of best I have ever had, anywhere. Whole experience was relaxing and unrushed.Definitely 10/10 and definitely would recommend. I will go back again next time I am in SG
5
Blown away by the quality. It was a complete surprise. Views are spectacular, especially if you can enjoy a drink in the bar before dinner. We had multiple starters (tuna cones, fois gras, pasta dish), all of which were top knotch and then followed it with the lamb dish. Everyone at our meal was impressed and the wine list was perfectly paired for the courses. Cheers
3
I booked this as a treat for our honeymoon and asked for a special table etc. When we go there it was nowhere near what we expected.The table was by the door. There was no excitement or special treatment of a honeymoon. The views aren't great at one side (where we were sat) as you are looking out to the swimming pool over anything else. The menu was not explained, the food was very simple and not of the quality that we expected. It was nice but "normal" nice.We had 2 courses, a coffee and a bottle of wine for the equivalent of £250gbp which for what you got was ridiculous.It is nice to tick off and say we gave it a try but it definitely had nicer meals on the harbour etc
5
The views are spectacular at Spago' overlooking the city lit up in lights outlining the various shapes and angles of modern buildings. Spago and The Cut, owned by the famous international chef, Wolfgang Puck, are in an extraordinary modern mall with shops of the highest quality global designers so one immediately expects that these two restaurants/bar will be upscale and very pricey. On exiting the elevator, I was not disappointed, there are dimmed lights, intimate dining rooms, modern music large windows to view the vibrant city. Spago does not lack customers because it can be difficult getting reservations at this popular dining/bar establishments. While Spago is very expensive, a customer will not be disappointed with the selections of appetizers, food and drinks. Staff is friendly and attentive to customers. In all, if budget permits, Istrongly recommend Spago and The Cut if you are in Singapore and you will not be disappointed.
3
I want to leave a glowing review of this establishment. The view from the top floor of the Sands Marina Bay is amazing. The menu is very appealing, and the presentation spot on. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. All that being said, it is so cold in the dining room that I honestly cannot remember what my dinner actually tasted like, which is a shame when you drop $400 on a meal. The staff was kind enough to bring us a shawl, but they did mention all of their supply were in use, which means they KNOW it is uncomfortably cold.
2
I was disappointed with the taste of the food, the presentation was superb but most of it tasted pre=cooked and/or cook chill particularly the fish, I would not go back there.
5
Had cocktails overlooking the infinity pool with views over Singapore followed by a great meal at Spargo.
Expensive -but you know that when you book.
Nearly Michelin star food in a great setting.
5
Special thanks to attentive waiter Valentine. He has made our night a special one. Food was great. They were able to cater for my vegetarian diet. Classic and modern ambience, romantic at night. Has the best view in Singapore looking over Gardens by the Bay on one side and the inifinity pool/city view on the other side.
5
We enjoy great food and excellent service by Mr. Ryan and his colleagues. The Restaurant was busy but staffs was super with their prompt service. Thanks Mr. Ryan and his wonderful colleagues and not forgetting Mr. Zu Yao for a wonderful evening. Excellent job Chefs. My second visit here thanks.
5
Yes, it's pricey but you get what you pay for.Happy hour in the lounge bar is from 7-9 where you can get 50% off selected cocktails.The service here is faultless, everyone there will help you with recommendations on drinks, questions with the menu, getting you the best seat possible etc.The food is exceptional, on our visit we had the duck and chicken breast and a side of fingerling potatoes "patatas bravas" - all come highly recommended. Although once we'd had a few cocktails and a main with sides we did miss out on the wonderful looking deserts!The venue - with its view - is amazing for a special occasion, you must go!
5
If you want to go somewhere special Singapore, you could treat yourself by eating at this restaurant. The prices are comparable with 5 star restaurants in Australia. We started with drinks at the bar on the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands. The views are magnificent and a great place to unwind and see the sunset.We celebrated 2 birthdays so the staff gave each of the birthday people cards signed by the staff. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. Dessert was personalised for the 2 special people with birthday wishes written in chocolate. It was a memorable night for all of us. We are planning another visit when we visit Singapore again next year

This is a nice way to start the day. That view is something you can never get bored of. Service is good but not great.Pros- Views, views, views- Casual, open air, resort feel is relaxing.- Food on the buffet is generally goodCons- Expensive $50+ pp- Buffet variety is poor- Long waits I would definitely go again but more for ambience and view than buffet quality or value
5
To start off, what turned out to be the best ever evening birthday celebration in Singapore, we had drinks @ bar on the 57th floor of Sparrow @ the Sand Marina Bay. The bar is located adjacent to the restaurant. On one side of the bar you get a view of the infinity pool which hangs out over the city and on the other is a night time view of the city which provides a wonderful backdrop to drinks and good conversation with family prior to dinner. Good booze , excellent service and a visit from the manager. A charming young lady who welcomes us and express b-day congratulations. Quickly follow-up by complimentary shots for the b-day boy! She knows her audience and undoubtedly we will be returning to this special place when the occasion arises. Outstanding service! Sorry I can't remember her name, but will not forget how she handled the occasion

Had planned to go for a special lunch with my family. Initial communications was quick, but became slower and slower after; didn't hear anything for a few days and was flying in from Amsterdam and thought everything was arranged: then received an email around 2:00 AM upon arrival in Singapore from the reservationists that a security deposit would be required to be able to sustain the requests we had made (that essentially meant asking for them to serve some pre-picked food from the menu). Was told this was only feasible through a secured PDF form - again this was received less than 10 hours before the actual lunch, sent a reply upon receivement that this wasn't do-able because of the late requirement and the fact I didn't bring my laptop on the trip; received a reply that this was company policy and there was no leeway. Told them to cancel - then received an email that after a long discussion with management we could still come without the deposit but the bad taste and pretentiousness of the staff had already settled unfortunately.Policy before guest service is never a good idea especially when being part of a 5-star hotel and having one Michelin star; these appalling procedures hurt business and service standards more than anything else.I am sure the food is good and all but if one is given this kind of attitudes when actually just trying to make life easier for everyone it leaves unfortunately a lot to be desired.....I hope this case ends up in a management and service training somewhere as it should. Perhaps try again in a couple of years but we would rather spend our money in a place with true hospitality

A special dinner to welcome family to Singapore for the F1 Grand Prix. Superb views over the Marina Bay Sands on one side and from the restaurant terrace over Gardens by the Bay to the coast on the other side. Meticulous service, gorgeous presentation of food and absolutely delicious food! $531 for dinner for three with cocktails and wine
5
There is currently a lunchtime special at SGD49 which 3 courses, 3-dish choice on starter and main.
Fantastic value and food excellent presentation second to none!
Pre booking essential
Fantastic views of Singapore as on 56th floor and surrounded by viewing areas WHOW
5
Everything from the drinks to the service is exemplar. The assistant GM politely asked if I would be so kind to move over a seat at the bar to make room for a party of 3, something I was more than happy to do...then he bought me a drink to say thanks. Service is sometimes a lost art in the eponymous industry...but it's been found at Spago
5
We visited Spago couple of times for drinks and each times, The choice of wines is excellent and the views are just brilliant at night. Definitely recommend it. The venue is pricy but you don't go here on a budget. You are going for the Views

We ate in the main restaurant here. The place itself is a nicely appointed room but sadly is enclosed so although it is situated on the Skypark of MBS you would not know it as there are no views at all. You really could be anywhere. Staff are very good indeed and the service was faultless. Food was the biggest problem. We eat at lots of Michelin starred places but we did not feel that the food here came anything close to what we are used to although prices are somewhat higher. The problems start with the menu which is so pretentiously worded that it is very difficult to work out what the various dishes on offer might be. Why not just tell us instead of Few. Words order. In. Any.Choose. Get the idea? It shouldn't be the Times cryptic crossword to work out what a dish might be.So not a bad meal but nowhere near what we hoped for
5
We had a light dinner in the bar & lounge area of Spago while staying at Marina Bay Sands. The staff were really friendly and the food came out pretty promptly. The food was amazing - we got multiple dishes to share and they were all amazing - particularly the pork belly! Great atmosphere and location
5
Obviously you din't go here on a backpacker budget, but at $400 odd SGD for 2 with (modest) french chablis and a pre drink, I thought smazing value. You are on top of MBS so I don't need to talk about the views. But food (including duck breast sns snapper laksa) was sublime snd the server so relaxed, friendly and attentive (but never overly so), even though we were no-ones compared to the VIPs who presumably frequent the place.I have been treated as second class in a few world class restaurants; including one of Ramsays (who is now off my list firever and wherever) not here. Wolfgang has it right. Check the prices and your budget, but if you can stretch, it is a must IMHO

We stayed at Marina bay sands and they booked a table for us two-three days prior and the hotel informed us the only available time slot was 9 pm. however we were ready and showed up at 8.15 pm and requested if we can get a table they informed us the table was not ready even though we could see there were lot of empty tables inside. We were seated at the lounge which was very nice and had great views with very expensive drink prices. Even at 9 they didn't come to tell us the table was ready we had to go and tell them it's 9 to let us in. Once inside the service was good and food tasted really good as well
5
We had drinks at the Spago Lounge & Bar while staying at the Marina Bay Sands! Thankfully we accidentally ended up here during happy hour which greatly helped offset the price of drinks. Some of the best cocktails we've had--but at a price. View was lovely, drinks were lovely, we enjoyed a lobster roll which was quite small but tasty
5
This is a Singapore must do for sure! If you're not staying at the hotel this is an opportunity for you get a sneak peak of the beautiful pool area (from the restaurant) as well as an amazing view of Singapore. Initially the service was slow but once we had service is was fantastic with staff being both pleasant and attentive (we had no language barrier with staff as other posters have commented). In fact, we had read the recent review commenting on the language challenges they faced and it almost made us not go there as we have celiac disease and really do need to make sure that we can communicate with servers, I am so glad that I didn't let that sway me because we would have lost out on a great meal and experience. My kids loved how the server included them when asking if the adults wanted coffee the server made a bid deal about ordering hot chocolate for the kids. The food was good but for us the view is what made the experience
5
It is an amazing place with a great view of the city and a good ambience! You can come here with colleagues or with friends- just sit back, relax, enjoy some tangy cocktails and nice food! This rooftop is always there in the top of my list and I frequent the place often..the staff is very polite and attentive here. A special thanks to JR and Bohdana for their service with a big smile
5
Had previously heard about this restaurant and finally got to visit. The food was excellent and we had fantastic service
4
Spago is always a treat no matter which location as their staff is always friendly and helpful and food is usually very good.
1
Have dined here many times while staying at MBS, find the management to be hit and miss. Appalling service and poor management again today. Expect much better treatment of hotel guests.
4
An absolute extravaganza of exquisite food coupled with sublime views of Singapore. The food was spectacular and everything was perfect however the waiter's communication skills left a little to be desired. A shame, as we were celebrating a very special double birthday and would have expected that a restaurant of this calibre to have had a more hospitable ambassador to represent it. The lounge bartender's outstanding professionalism however, quickly banished all unpleasant memories of the waiter at the restaurant
5
I first reviewed this place on its opening night and unfortunately only just had the opportunity to return. But return I did and it didnt fail me. Fantastic view, fantastic service and great food. Its not cheap, no its not. But it is amazing and sometimes you have to pay for that
5
An awesome experience of business lunch by a pool which is one if it's kind. Great service by the staff and chef was fantastic. Even he created some if the dishes to keep our taste buds happy. Unbelieve range of wine and we had the opportunity if tasting four different types. A bid expensive but worth the experience
5
We had an absolutely unforgettable night, from arrival our server was so helpful with suggestions on what to order. Entree , main and deserts worth every cent. My now fiancÃ© proposed and we were given free champagne and the kitchen wrote congratulations on our plates, we were congratulated by multiple staff which made it all the more special. We would love to return ! Maybe our honeymoon:
5
This place is a must if visiting Singapore would be the highlight of our stay.We booked online a month before our lunch visit but the restaurant wasnt full so maybe we did not need to book so far in advance.They do an express lunch menu for $45.00 three courses was just delightful The Wolfgang Puck Pinot Noir at $120.00 a bottle was out there price wise but a delightful drop and offset by the very reasonable priced lunch menu we were a little early so we taking to the bar for a pre dinner drink and the view from the pool and beyond is amazing with a beer in one hand next time in Singapore a first stop for a meal
4
Was here for drinks on a Friday afternoon and it was quite crowded. The view from the restaurant was amazing! You could see the city landscape, gardens by the bay, the sea and the infinity pool! Good place to bring your overseas guests! Of cos, the price is on the higher en
5
Phenomenal meal!! Definitely my favorite restaurant I've eaten at in nearly 3 years in Singapore. The food is amazing. We had the beet salad, honey glazed black cod, tuna tartare and the caramel souffle, all of which were delicious and unique. The honey glaze on the black cod was sooooo gooooood!!On top of that, the service was the best. Michael and his team were so attentive and explained every little detail of the menu. They took the time to visit, but service was very efficient and professional. They also know their food and understand both gluten-free and vegetarian concerns very well.Oh, and view at night is beautiful. It all made for a perfect evening
5
Had breakfast here every morning during our stay at Marina Bay Sands. Variety was great, the service was on par and the food quality was not a disappointment. Husband and teenage boys still talk about the "streaky pork bacon" that they fell in love with.
5
The attraction here is the 57-floor view of Singapore but the food also is good. We shared a prawn salad and a huge basket of french fries, which was enough for two.
5
We dined in the sky on the 57 floor at Spago. The Chardonnay wine by Wolfgang Puck was very good at $120 Singapore dollars per bottle. Started with the grilled Spanish octopus which was enough just to share. Three of us tried the veal ragu penne pasta, razor clams and lamb chops. All were excellent we had empty plates all the way around. Afterwards you can look over the pool into the evening sky. You can't enter the pool area but you cab see the infinity pool and have great views
5
My husband and I went to the top of the Marina Sands complex and found we were able to have a drink at Spago. Our hostess Michelle was wonderfully welcoming and after she found out we were celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary with a holiday in Singapore she brought us a complememtary dessert which just made our night. Wonderful setting, staff and service. Many thanks

We enjoyed a very interesting and delicious dinner one evening at the Spago Terrace Lounge on level 57 at the MBS Hotel. You have to be a guest at the hotel to use this restaurant and go through electronic gates with your key card. Spago also has a fine dining restaurant but this is the more casual of the two eateries.The seating is largely lounge type seating with low tables, the lighting is very dim – so much so that we needed to peer intently at the menu just a couple of inches from our noses. The waiters actually shine small torches when they discuss menu items with you.My dining companion ordered and enjoyed the Japanese Fried Chicken “Karaage” which at $18 was very reasonably priced. I requested the Spicy Scallop & Tempura Asparagus Sushi Rolls which were delicious although at $34 not cheap. Servings sizes were on the small side but the food was beautifully presented and tasted great. We followed this up with one of the best desserts ever - Mochi Waffle Ice Cream Sandwich which was two wedges of a delicious waffle sandwiching coconut ice cream accompanied by a separate small bowl of passionfruit sauce. The service was excellent. Our waiter was very friendly, helpful and attentive with a good sense of humour. It’s advertised as an “al fresco” terrace restaurant, but don’t worry you’ve got a very good, solid roof over your heads, so plenty of weather protection, should you need it. The views on both sides of the restaurant are superb, one side with the cityscape looking out over the infinity pool and the other over the bay. Can definitely recommend
5
First the restaurant is well located, the staff is amazing, food was average , but my taste is special, I like lots flavored and spices. But if your taste is not for hot and spicy you will enjoy. The pasta was perfect cook , and desert didn't look the most cute , but the taste was delicious
5
All the food and drinks were amazing, we had excellent service and what a spectacular view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Highly recommend the restaurant it is a Wolf Gang Puck restaurant so it never seizes to amaze the quality, food and service. You will not be disappointed
5
WOW!! What a marvellous way to end our Singapore holiday. Yes, we may have had a little trouble getting to the 57 floor, but that shouldn't take away any credit from warm and inviting staff and the amazing and talented chefs. Our server was helpful and made great suggestions from the menu and the amount we should order. As a family of 3, we started with the larger portion of the veal ragu pasta (had a little spice and was the perfect start) which came out already shared onto 3 plates. For mains we shared the snapper laksa and veal steak with a side of broccoli and potatoes. Seriously don't have the words!As for dessert, we'll see the pictures. You would come here along just for these!!Thank you to all staff for a memorable evening!
5
We went to Spago for drinks and were not disappointed. The bar offers a broad selection of drinks in reasonable prices and the staff is very kind and attentive. The restaurant and bar is located on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands and thus provide awesome views of the cityscape. You can see both the marina and gardens by the bay. Near the restaurant is the hotel pool with even better views of the city, though you have to be a hotel guest to be able to use it.
5
Had the chance to visite Singapore first time and my feet just took me straightaway to that amazing restaurant called spago by wolfgang puck we sit in the lounge in the afternoon and you can check in but never check out.Amazing first impression by sunny she was looking after us very polite and professional with skills of suggestion, we also would like to thank the chef that you can taste inspiration and passion in her food.Best part of the night when we started with cocktails one makes you forget the other one and just makes you want to try more and more the star of the night was Lucas Floor manager that check on us just on the right time and being brilliant with his knowledge made us have an amazing selection of cocktails tailored to our preference.Well done spago team for making our experience remarkable, we will recommend your place and we will back..
5
We were lucky enough to get a table here and the food was excellent. The chef had a delightful way of building on tradition and making it his own. Try the Soufflé Dessert it is amazing.
4
The food was lovely. Light and filling lunch menu which we thoroughly enjoyed. The staff were very attentive and helpful. Highly recommended
4
Dining room is considerably empty compared to the outside bar which makes the atmosphere rather dull. Food was all delicious, nothing super creative but all excecuted perfectly. Black cod and agnolotti pasta were our table's favorites. True to American style, portions are huge, sharing main and dessert is recommended
5
Everything is wonderful about Spago's in Singapore! The service is great, the food just perfect, and take advantage of the sommelier when selecting wines. Now enjoy a great evening.Started with AP Agnolotti and Kaya Toast. The Kaya Toast is Seared Foie Gras with Pandan-Coconut Jam, Foie Gras-Espresso Mousse and Toasted Brioche it was absolutely wonderful - the flavors worked together perfectly. The AP Agnolotti could be described as mini cheese raviolis but so much much better when done at Spagos. Melted in your mouth - could have just ordered more of these!Next came Crispy Sea Bass and Duck Breast. The Crispy Sea Bass was some of the best fish ever tasted so juicy and well cooked. The Duck Breast was absolutely great - so tender and juicy - these entrees were perfect.Ended the meal with a soufflé which was a great way to finish the evening. To top it all off the food, pre-dinner drinks, 2-1/2 bottles of wine, service charge and tip less then $500 ! A great deal!!Oh - did I mention the view! One side of windows looks towards the Marine Sands Infinity pool but a clear view which is perfect because you don't need to see that from the restaurant. The other side (Southern) looks down over the Gardens by the Bay, the Harbour and out to the ocean which is great. Ask for a table along this side
5
Spago LA is one of my favorite restaurants...and Spago Singapore didn't disappoint! Located on top of the Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant and view are simply amazing.The food and service in the restaurant was awesome as always but the best part at this location is the outdoor bar. We had drinks and appetizers every day while staying at the hotel. The appetizers (spicy tuna cones, smoked salmon, spicy tuna rolls) were delicious! Shout out to Carmichael the bartender for taking great care of us.My only complaint was a food allergy issue. I'm allergic to cucumbers and olives and I encountered both, despite neither being listed in the offending appetizers. Carmichael handled it wonderfully and took care of the olive incident. The manager was less than accommodating with the cucumber incident, essentially blaming me for not know cucumber was in a spicy tuna roll that didn't list cucumber (although the roll above it listed cucumber as an ingredient!). Either way, not enough to ruin our time there, but do beware of food allergies and let the staff know
4
Went here on my birthday while visiting classmates in Singapore. Excellent location and view of the city. Service was very attentive with a great sommelier. Food was good, in particular the soufflé for dessert. Only thing stopping me from giving a 5 is the food didn't justify the price. Still worth a try though
5
Service, food, and ambiance all amazing.Such a beautiful restaurant and they staff managed to squeeze us in without a booking. The dishes were amazing and very large portions, if I were to go again I would opt to share an entree and main (as this is an option) as we were far too full to try desert and the food was too good to leave any behind! This is a pricey choice and should be a special occasion but it is well worth a splurge!
5
Spago at Marina Bay Sands. I came for a flying visit to Singapore to see a mate who lives here now, everyone I spoke to before I left said I had to visit this place, they weren't wrong. Such an unbelievable spot for drinks or dinner. We had cocktails that are brilliantly named and expertly made. There's a pool on the top so you can chill by that in the day. The views can not be described in words and my photos don't do them justice. Just get up there, see for yourself, you won't be disappointed.
5
This is a wonderful restaurant with great service and fabulous food. From their signature dish of Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones, Hand Cut Agnolotti , followed by the Grilled French Sea Bass and Duck, the meal was outstanding. I had dessert which was the Salted Caramel Soufflé which I loved. It made our celebration so special. Thank you to Tomas and the other staff. We also took photos from the balcony overlooking the Giant Trees which gave us an incredible view from the 57th Floor of Marina Bay Sands. A culinary delight is behind the blue door
5
Celebrated our anniversary and husband's birthday dinner here, after reading the reviews.We were impressed by the quality of the food and the attentive service from the staff. There wasn't a tasting menu on the day we were there. But the staff had recommended the Burrata with parma and corn, tagliatelle with black truffles, NY sirloin steak and duck breast. We decided to share a caramel souffle for dessert.All our choices turned out right. The appetisers were fresh (corn was very sweet, the aroma from the black truffles was overpowering) and the taste was nowhere near the usual burrata and spaghetti dishes. Beef was tender and without any layers of fats and tendon that one would always get with sirloin cuts. The beef was sliced when served. Ditto for the duck which was very tender and had minimal chewy tendons in the breast. The caramel souffle dessert had a uniquely crispy (from the caramel bits) yet fluffy bite and the fuji apple sorbet on the side was sweet, refreshing and aromatic.We had a great time with the food and nice ambience, and enjoyed the service of the attentive staff who even decorated the dessert and presented us with greeting cards to celebrate the occasion with us
5
Went here to celebrate our anniversary. Food was excellent, the service outstanding and the views were breathtaking. One of our favourite nights anywhere. Not cheap but great value for money. Save up and go.
5
If you get a chance to experience this, then take what will be a special opportunity. The views from 57th floor are amazing from a big open bar playing great music. The service was very haphazard and lacking at times despite the number staff to guests ratio. The cocktails were first class once we were able to order and once they arrived. As a non guest, take MRT to Bayfront, walk to Tower 2, take lift to 55, switch lifts to floor 57.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful
5
Couldn't fault anything, great service, delicious food (all of it) and amazing views. Staff were friendly, without being pushy.. not the pretentious atmosphere you might expect from fine dining at the top of Marina Bay Sands. Staff were happy for us to order some of the shoestring fries that we spied in the bar next door prior to our mea
5
Amazing view. We were placed in the centre of the lounge, and asked about relocating to a side table with a view, and the staff were very accommodating and whisked us over within 5 mins. Ask about the cocktail specials if you're there in the evening - we got $13 cocktails which is pretty amazing in Singapore with that view! Well worth it. Be aware there isn't air con, just fans - for the menfolk shorts and shirts seem fine.
5
There is not a single negative comment I would ever make about Spago. The location on top of Marina Bay Sands is perfect with stunning views of Singapore. Service is spotless, even though they are extremely busy. They constantly check on the diners if their meals are up to their liking. Food is just exquisite. From caviar through sea bream and rabbit of course all the way to the soufflé the dinner was just perfect. Paired with the best beverages possible. From the general manager all the way to the runners and of course the kitchen, thank you for making our experience so special
4
We came here for our anniversary, as we are big fans of Cut but wanted to try something different from wolfgang puk's stable. Spago is a good upper middle restaurant for those who like wholesome western food. Service is excellent, and the views from the top of the casino are great. The food is what you would expect for this price bracket, good but not knock yourself out awesome. Fairly standard fare, and not too many interesting twists or surprises. The wine is pricey and can be a surprise at the end of the night. A good business lunch or date venue, and the bar next door looks nice and has a decent vibe
5
We were in Singapore visiting family and our son and his good lady took us here as special treat to celebrate a recent big birthday and wedding anniversary The meal we had was awesome exquisitely presented by a first class team of servers Apart from the superb starters and main courses a special mention has to be made about the absolutely gorgeous salted chocolate soufflé followed by the equally impressive expresso martini cocktails All in all a superb night out with views from the 57th floor that are not what I have experienced in my 70 years Big thanks to all the staff not forgetting of course my much loved so
5
Having been to Wolfgang Puck's Chinois on Main and Spago in California, I was eager to try the restaurant. The location at the top of Marina Towers was spectacular as was the service, food, and the staff's attention to detail.A true Wolfgang Puck delightful experience!!!
5
I have been meaning to write a review for Spago but have been procrastinating. Better late than never. This is our favorite place in Singapore to chill. The cocktails are the best in town and so consistent every time we visit. The service is impeccable. Staff is super friendly and efficient. We tried the snacks for the first time last evening and it was super delicious! Couldn't find fault with anything! Just love this place for the lovely ambiance and the amazing views. The music isn't too loud and allows you to have conversations with your group/partner. A must visit place
1
The view from the top is awesome---- and there it ends. We were not staying here, thank goodness, but impression was it resembled a conference centre on entering! The pool on the top floor was FULL of children up to closing time of 11pm.Food in Spago was very good though ambience and view were pretty non existent.For me I would defo not even contemplate staying here!
4
Its a pricey restuarant but with great quality food. Service was awesome as they are personalized and attentive. Will be back for special occasion again. 👍
5
We dined here with our 4 friends whilst staying at Marina Bay Sands. Spago was always on my list of places to dine when we were here and I am so glad that we did it. All 6 of us had the most amazing night. Between the phenomenal food and service, you couldn't ask for a better night. We have dined at a lot of restaurants but Spago surpassed almost every one of them. If you are staying at Marina Bay or even in Singapore do yourself a favour and dine here, you wont regret it
4
I had the lunch special here (appetizer, entree, and dessert) for a fixed price that was not that much more than I would have spent to go up on the Observation Deck of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. The restaurant is located on the top floor and had nice views upon entrance of the Infinity Pool and I was able to sneak out to the balcony to take some pictures of the Gardens by the Bay which is adjacent to the hotel. Service was good but it took a very long time for my entree--apparently the chef overcooked the initial dish so they had to remake it. The restaurant made it right though when they offered me my choice of dessert from the regular menu (not the choice that came with the prix fix lunch special) and that truly was an incredible dessert!!!! Both the appetizer (tuna tartare in cones) and main dish (burger and fries) were excellent too but the dessert was the winner. I would visit this restaurant again if in Singapore for the food and views and it seemed to be an excellent place for a special occasion
5
We dined at Spago by Wolfgang Puck on 57th floor during our recent stay at the MBS hotel. The whole experience was excellent. The food was first class and Mark, our waiter, was very helpful. It was busy on the evening we dined so reservations would be a good idea. There is also a more informal dining area in Spago with bar and soft sitting areas and that was always busy and popular during our stay
5
I had dinner on the Terrace this week with two friends. It was my first time at Spago and I have to say it beats many of the other rooftop lounge-dining places in Marina Bay by a long shot. It is a really beautiful place that has been well thought out for style, comfort and elegance. The seating, cushions, magical bar, airy space, mood lighting and exceptional views all make for a wonderful ambiance. This stands in contrast to some other places in Marina Bay that just feel crowded and noisey. The staff were all terrific and incredibly efficient - in fact, unbelieveably so. The small bite menu was very good with some dishes better than others, as you would expect. We stopped for a drink at the bar to end the night and sat up on the stools to be surrounded by a galaxy of lights from the Singapore skyline. The bar staff are totally fabulous, hospitable and good humoured which really says something given the fact that they are on the go all of the time. There is no doubt about it that it was a pricey night but to a large extent we were in control of the bill with the food we ordered, the wine, beer and cocktails. Overall a great experienc

My daughter's choice for lunch before her graduation was Spago's. She simply adores the food, in particular the Pan Seared Pork Dumplings and the Hand Cut Agnolotti with celery root black truffle mousse, truffle butter mascarpone and parmesan. I like the view and the feel of the restaurant. It feels like you're doing the fine dining culture of Singapore justice when you dine at the top of the Marina Bay Sands overlooking the city's skyline. And this time, in particular, I loved the service. Our waiter, Ian did a spectacular job. And considering my daughter just wrote a book for her senior project called "How to Bring Fine Dining Home," we're pretty aware of the rules and regulations of how a fine dining establishment should behave and bravo Ian, you passed with flying colors. He was particularly helpful in assisting me with choices that would keep me on my low-carb diet. The kitchen prepared a special delicious salad for me and I had a perfectly cooked steak. And to celebrate her graduation, the entire staff signed a card and a lovely dessert was delivered. It was a grand lunch fit for a special occasion. But I will go again and try their 3 course express menu for $45 or another special they have posted on their website. Check out the Sundowner special: Watch the sun set from the top of the Marina Bay Sands,with cocktails and wine from $10 and Signature Bites from $12? It can't get better than that

I went last Saturday for lunch, great atmosphere, fabulous view of Singapore and especially the gardens by the bay. Love watching the infinity pool! It looked as though swimmers would fall over but fortunately -mono way. Breakfast was good and restaurant was full of Singaporean atmosphere. It was great to be on the ground later and see where I had bee
5
We booked Spago as a treat during our stay in Singapore and it gave us a good excuse to get to the top of the stunning Marina Bay Sands Hotel. My friend and I had the set lunch menu which was great value for money. With a choice of three dishes for starter and main course, each dish was presented beautifully and tasted delicious. There was one dessert on offer but it was the perfect end to the meal. It was my birthday and the staff had put a candle on the dessert and gave me a card signed by all the staff which was a nice touch. The service was efficient but friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed. We had a view over the sea. Our visit did give us the opportunity to have a look at the famous infinity pool although you can't take a dip unless you stay at the hotel, unfortunately. Well worth a visit
5
Celebrated my birthday here and was very impressed with the food. We started with a few drinks in the bar area which has amazing views, we were very impressed with the cost of the drinks, not as expensive as we had assumed and will certainly look to visit again. Story was similar in the restaurant, drinks menu was very reasonable. We had wonderful service from our waiter who was most knowledgeable and helpful with our decision making (we all struggled to choose as all the dishes sounded so appealing!) and we were all very impressed with the dishes. Food was expensive however worthwhile for a celebration or treat
5
We arrived, with a reservation for the lounge specifically at 6:30 as part of a graduation celebration. Hostess team was friendly and we were seated in the lounge though in a marring of the experience were seated in the middle instead of closer to either side so with a better view when there were other tables also reserved but empty, this slight snub was the only down note on a lovely evening. The staff were polite and professional, the drinks are pricey, but being above the 50th floor, you gotta pay for the view, and a very impressive view it is. The food offerings are well executed and offer nice twists on American and Asian fare. The layout is nice and airy, open to breezes on both sides and pretty as the sun goes down. The place fills up and you want a reservation or you will be sitting at the crowded bar. The vibe is a mixture of pool and club, think Vegas, and certainly not for every one, but even in a town full of great restaurants like S'pore, it's worth the visit
5
Food and service almost perfect compared to other fine dining restaurants in Marina Bay Sands. So I ended up visiting for lunch 2 days in a row. And to top it off, the view of the city was breathtaking!
5
Great food, amazing views, impeccable service. It is a bit on the pricey side, but for the quality and location definitely worth it!
5
We never had a bad meal in Singapore, all the choices and dishes were excellent, and we ate a variety of dishes that we do not get at home, but all meals were expensive.
5
Go for the business lunch, it is a great bargain.
The location is stunning, on the top of the Marina Bay Sands.
The restaurant is very stylish and the food was absolutely amazing. Great service in a relaxed atmosphere. Highly recommended!
5
Incredible view and surprisingly very affordable drinks. Great choice of cocktails with awesome ambiance. A must visit place in Singapore.
5
The view of the straits of Singapore and the surrounding area is incredible. The drinks are expensive (expected) but really good - I had the gin and bear it which was excellent. The infinity pool is very cool and the views are spectacular.
5
Dined in the restaurant at Spago while staying at MBS as an early celebration of our 40th Wedding Anniversary and we are so glad we did. It was a dining experience we will never forget. We arrived early and were taken to the bar lounge to enjoy a drink. When our table was ready one of the stunning hostesses came and took us into the restaurant. We were seated at a table on the window looking over the Infinity pool and the Singapore skyline. Our waitress was amazing, and I am so sorry that I can't remember her name, she helped us choose what to eat and here recommendations were spot on. And the wine we chose was also very enjoyable. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very relaxing and subtle. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. We felt that the value for money for a 5 star dining experience was well worth what we paid.Would not hesitate to dine here again if we are ever in Singapore

Visited here in March for our Wedding Anniversary and really loved this place. A big thank you to Carmichael and Feleciano for making our couple of visits there memorable. They even gave us dessert on the house with Happy Anniversary! The food is good and the view is amazing being on the 43rd floor with an amazing infinity pool going right the way along. It's the middlle of three towers and from the bottom looks like a big ship. The atmosphere was the best here and we visited many restaurants on our stay in Singapore. Highly recommend this place ohh and they have half price cocktails every afternoon! Thanks guys for a truly amazing experience.

Went to Spago for lunch, opted for the prix fixe menu. The appetizers and entree (grilled angus beef burger) were OK, but the dessert of Pistachio Panna Cotta, was absolutely heavenly. While the prix fixe meal was very reasonably priced, we managed to rack up a pretty hefty bill by ordering wine and two rounds of coffee. Overall, the very pleasant, unhurried lunch was worth it. We had a good table, a fantastic view of the bay, and a wait staff that was very friendly
5
I always deemed Spago as an overrated and overpriced restaurant but my meal totally changed my perception. My friends threw a surprise birthday dinner for me and it was truly the most special meal I have had in the city. Everything, from the service, atmosphere, view, food and ambience was beyond perfect. I think it's more of an experience than a meal, though it is on the pricey side. Being a group of complete foodies we ended up trying a lot of things. Highly recommend the steak, burrata with pear, arrabiata and the sweet selection. The wine list is extensive too. The salted caramel souffle was divine to say the least. The view was also a steal. Highly recommend Spago for a super meal and a unique experience
4
Was a good meal but nothing special that you would expect for this price range. The service was average for quality of restaurant and the food was not up to the standard you would hope for in this price range but still good.
1
Awful service, Awful food and dirty plates and glasses.
10 minutes to bring a bottle of water and 20 Minutes to bring 2 cocktails when the restaurant is not even full.
5
presentation 10/10 taste 10/10 ambiance 10/10 Staff 10/10 all in all a truly amazing culinary experience. well worth the expense.

At the top floor of the Marina Bays Sands the location of this restaurant is in itself awesome. Fortunately there is more that the location and the view, for lunch the food was excellent and the service was friendly although not very fast. This is a place to visit and enjoy while visiting Singapore. Highly recommended
5
This was our 5th visit to Spagos - the service is friendly and efficient - the location and views on level 57 of Marina Bay Sands are awesome and the food is delicious and beautifully presented every time - consistency is their thing!!Can highly recommend the Executive Lunch, and the new additions such as the Chicken Salad and the Bolognaise are delicious. The Laksa Spring rolls for entree a must !!We believe this to be the best lunch in Singapore - after lunch we always go to their open bar next door to enjoy the view and delicious cocktails
3
This place is nothing special. The ambiance is a turnoff, the staff is detached and tries their best to be as American as possible, even though they are locals. And that turns me off completely. The food is nothing too exciting either. Oh an no specially nice views. Safve some money and go somewhere else.
2
I have no idea why this is so highly rated. It is expensive for what you get - the mains are so small that you'll mistake them for a tasting menu. Some of the starters are like an amuse bouche. You're paying for the location and view. We each had three course and left hungry then got more food elsewhere!If this was in London, it would not do well against similar priced restaurants that provide better quality food
5
Came for dinner with my mom and had the most amazing meal. We shared the apple and cucumber salad which was so fresh and tangy. I had the monkfish with lobster and my mother had the organic pan roasted chicken with the most unbelievable jus which I drank from the spoon! Excellent service, gorgeous setting. Great menu, excellent wine selection. Must be prepared to pa
5
We had the fixed price lunch menu which was really good value at 45sgd for 3 courses. The service and food were incredible. We spent the whole day in the area and so I think we were a bit underdressed as I couldn't wear a posh outfit to wander around in all day (we were staying in the Clarke quay area which is quite far) so try and dress nice to come here as it is a bit posh. If you're not staying at the hotel this is a great way to see the views for free
5
Our 2nd Wolfgang Puck restaurant in 2 nights. Spago was a true delight. A lovely menu. We had the most delicious cucumber and apple salad. Oh my word out of this world. Served with warm bread. I had the chicken. Just unreal. My daughter had the monk fish. Ended off with fresh mint tea. Great meal. So worth every penn
5
Some of the best food i've had. Interesting, well designed food, well plated, but wonderfully tasty which is most important. Good wine list and for the quality quite reasonable..service excellent too..
5
During my stay at the hotel I was visiting the bar regularly. The staff was really friendly and very helpful! They made me feel really welcomed! Definitely want to go back again!
4
Italian food revisited by the chef . Graphic, nice and good. On the top of marina bay sand view on the city and the swimming pool.
5
On TOP of MBS , fantastic view from the top floor , excellent food , wine and service , really to be recommended for high end business lunch / dinner or a very special date with your wife
5
We went there for dinner while on a 4 day trip in Singapore.Found the restaurant while looking for the ones located on the roof of Marina Bay Sands.First of all the location is just awesome. Placed on top of Skypark at Marina Bay Sands you can enjoy the maginificiant view around you. Really extraordinary. During our stay there were thunderstorms all around Singapore. That made it even more special.For the dinner we had a salad as an entree followed by a lobster risotto. Main course was the US rib eye beef still on the bone but perfectly cooked. Really an experience.The restaurant itself has a really American touch what you can feel in terms of service speed. They were really fast bringing all courses one after the other. :-)Along with the dessert (wonderful soufflee) this was an amazing experience.The staff was on top and very attentive.We can recommend the restaurant to eveyone
4
The view is amazing! The food was also extremely good with excellent presentation! The service was good but not necessarily exceedingly good. We don't mind paying the price for good food and wine. I would say that the wine in this establishment is overpriced. You can plan to people dinner about a wine $500
4
Great place to celebrate a special event with good view. Go to see the sunset and make sure you request for a table next to the windows. Food was great however more on the expensive side. Note the price on the menu does not include the 7% gst and 10% service cost
5
What a view! And what a bar!We were recommended to visit Spago by a friend who lives in Singapore, and we had such a great evening! Situated on the top floor (Level 57) of Marina Bay Sands Hotel (Tower 2) it has fabulous views of all of Singapore. We were lucky enough to get a seat upon arrival but I would recommend booking at busy times like sunset. There are 2 areas – the fine dining Michelin Starred restaurant by Wolfgang Puck, and the more relaxed lounge area. We opted for the lounge area. No this does not give you access to the infamous infinity pool (only hotel guests have access to this), but the lounge is situated literally overlooking it, so it’s like you could be in there!The staff were particularly accommodating and helpful when discussing the menu, and also our plans while staying in Singapore.The food served here is finger food, but it’s a very very nice selection. Between 2 of us we ordered 7 dishes including sushi, spring rolls, mini burger sliders and lobster roll. All of the dishes were delicious! We had mocktails that were specially made for us as there are only 3 on the menu. We had one with rose flavor which was amazing.Do realize its NOT CHEAP up there – we spent s$ 300 with no alcohol, but to be fair you are up on a stunning hotel rooftop, with amazing views, in the middle of Singapore, the service is great, and the food is brilliant. So even though it’s a lot of money I think its worth it and value for money as well. Would love to visit there again.. hopefully next time as a guest of the hotel
5
Great food with the best view in town! We had an excellent dinner in Raffles the night before so this had a lot to live up to and it didn't disappoint, partly in that it's so different. It's contemporary and cool, not traditional and steeped in history. Up on the 57th floor you're greeted with the sight of the hotel infinity pool before being led into the chic, modern dining room. The food is really good and doesn't come across as too pretentious as can happen. It was delicious, well cooked food, served by attentive staff. The Red Snapper Laksa was particularly good. I could have eaten it twice over! After, we had a drink outside on the sofa overlooking the infinity pool and the view beyond. Then we swapped to the balcony on the other side where we could admire the view of the Gardens by the Bay. Spago is cool and calm amid the chaos and bustle of Marina Bay Sands and it's Skypark.
5
This is a really nice bar in singapore. The atmosphere and decor are fantastic, not to mention the view of the CBD one side, and the sea on the other. The sundowner drinks menu which is Mon - Thurs 4pm-7pm i believe is actually very reasonable considering where you are, though if you want to eat dinner there brace yourself for a very punchy menu. Sometimes service is slightly slow, but the friendliness of the staff make up for it
5
A great place to start the day by the pool overlooking the city eating amazing food. You can't beat the views or the variety. Service is great too.
5
Cant go wrong with this spot! Always great service and food and the view doesn't hurt! Must do in Singapore!
5
Expensive but very good restaurant right in the heart of Marina Bay Sands. The menu is really amazing. The dinner was really perfect, food was really good, fresh and tasty. The chefs creations was really extraordinary.
5
Great food, with beautiful presentations and extremely attentive and discrete waiters.
I had dinner outside, enjoying the marvellous view on Marina Bay.
Very expensive, but no regrets: it was definitely worth it.
3
It was not my fav so far but still will recommend it to others since my friends like it here.
Good service
5
Having dined here before it was definitely on the list of places to visit while in Singapore. Non guests of the Marina Bay Sands are welcome here and the view from the top is just spectacular. Prices are a little expensive but worthwhile for the experience. Beers go for about $12, cocktails around $20 and entree size meals in the $12-18 range. The staff were very friendly and helpful and I will always return here for the experience
2
It's still the case that this place has a great view, but in all honesty, the food is mediocre and the service is terrible. Unless the view is all that matters, grab a drink at the Flight Bar instead and save your stomach for a Hawker stall
5
Perched 57 stories above ground, you are part of the clouds! What a glorious setting for this restaurant with fabulous views.This is enhanced by your dining experience.. sparkling glasses, crisp linen and shining cutlery set off with mini arrangements of orchids.One can dine here for S$45 per person for the set menu, wherein you get a choice of starters and mains, with a fixed dessert.We ordered one set menu and some items ( Mediterranean prawns, sorbet dessert) from the ala carte menu. Every dish was superb in presentation and taste. An extensive wine list was also available.The service hovered between courteous and formal to happy and cheerful, depending upon who was around you at a given time.The ambiance was enlivened by a group of ladies out to lunch, who apparently had a fair amount of libations!Still, a lovely place to visit for the views and the food...... heartily recommended
5
I was visiting singapore and wanted to have a memorable dining experience, decided to book a table at Spago. It is an expensive affair but the food was simply unbelievable. We ordered the pan roasted chicken, the lamb chops and the short ribs. The lamb chops and the ribs are the best I've eaten so far. Great ambience as well
5
One of the best restaurant in Singapore which served the Californian Asian Crossover Cuisine by the renowned celebrity chef, Wolfgang Puck. You should be here at least once in a lifetime. It only costs you $45 to enjoy a fabulous 3 courses lunch menu in the celebrity chef restaurant with the stunning infinity pool and skyline view. Chicken 'Laksa' Spring Rolls is the MUST TRY We had additional 2 plates a-la-carte of it. We really enjoy the atmosphere in the dining room with the cozy music. All the staff is very friendly and attentive. One of the best place to date with love in town. We will definitely go for dinner date in near future
5
It was my last meal before flying out of Singapore and it was a very memorable one!
The dining room looks great, Janet Lee looked after us very well and the food prepared by Greg Bess was out of this world!
5
Food and service was excellent, and the views were spectacular - would be a great spot for visitors to Singapore. Will happily come back again.
5
Had breakfast here while staying at the Marina Bay Sands. Must say I was quite impressed- comprehensive spread, excellent service and great tasting food. The waiters even went out of their way to make my toddler a fresh stack of blue berry pancakes. The views are sensational to you look out into their infinity pool and beyond on 57th floor.
5
Everything about my visit was exceptional. Attention to details, superb service, amazing food, fantastic ambiance, top location. The 3 course set lunch menu was fairly priced at$45 and the portion sizes and flavours were really good. Simply a 5-star afternoon even though it was raining heavily and we could not enjoy the amazing view, the experience at the restaurant was more than enough to make me forget about the weather.
5
After being in Singapore for a couple of days we decided this was a must visit. We had a fabulous lunch at Spago the restaurant /bar in the middle tower on the 57th floor, probably one of the best burgers I've had! We were expecting it to be really expensive but was pleasantly surprised. The view over the infinity pool and beyond was spectacular. Staff were really friendly and the place had a lovely atmosphere. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Singapor
4
We had a really nice time up here and our first night in Singapore. The food was nice and drinks great too, we loved the views from up there. Thought it was a bit overpriced but expected it to be. We didn't think the staff were particularly friendly - probably as we are not the right age group!! Still enjoyed it and would recommend it
5
We had dinner at the Spago Terrace for my birthday and it was a truly special event. It was our last night in Singapore and we had our 3 yr old in tow so could not eat in the dining room. My husband had planned it as a surprise and it is a stunning setting. The food was outstanding but what made our evening really special was the arrival of host Glynn. Her personal service was so amazing, she knew the menu inside out and suggested the perfect cocktails based on our taste. To top it off, at the end of the meal a special birthday 'cake' complete with candles and a birthday greeting for me.The setting was beautiful, the food was superb, but it was the personal care and attention that made the evening truly memorable. Very impressive
5
Absolutely wonderful meal in a beautiful restaurant with stunning views from the 57th floor - what more could you want? The menu was so interesting that I could eat new dishes every day for a week. Started with exquisite veal tartare followed by the freshest sashimi. The service was outstanding from knowledgeable staff who clearly love their work. Dessert was a vacherin with vanilla and calamansi and blueberries/meringue. Every dish was beautifully presented and worth every penny. An absolute must-go in Singapore and was, without doubt, the best meal I have had for a very long time.
5
It was a surprise dinner from my husband. I immediately loved the location, view and warm welcoming staff which made me feel very special! The staff was very friendly and accommodative throughout our night. We had very unique local dish called Laksa, nicely balanced and full of flavors, we like it a lot. I want to say big thank you to a pastry chef for my birthday cake, was absolutely outstanding and to the whole team for the birthday wish! Looking forward to my next visit

I took some guests to Spago last week for lunch. The overall dining experience was good. The appetisers and deserts were memorably excellent. The main courses, were good. Inside the restaurant the service was outstanding. Each staff member was most pleasant and attentive. The disappointment was the three servers, outside of the restaurant who's role it was to confirm the reservation and show the guests to the gate which opens into the restaurant. My friends came before us, and were made to feel very unwelcome. My own experience was similar. Their attitude of the 3 "concierge" servers was in stark contrast to those outside the restaurant. With so many good dining choices in Singapore , I dont think I would hurry back, I want my guests to feel like a welcome and not have to apologise to the,
5
From the entrance to leaving it was an unbelievable experience well worth the cost ,wine was expensive but you don't have to drink !!
5
Lovely location with excellent view.. drinks were good and had a good ambience.. music not too loud and non smoking areas are plenty..
4
The food and cocktails are quite good though severely overpriced. However, the combination of the food and view there is definitely worth the money.
5
Went to the bar rather than the restaurant. Was a full moon night and the view is amazing. You see both out into the bay and the city. The cocktails could be better and the bar food surprisingly is Sushi but was good.
5
We selected the fixed three course menu and pleasantly surprised at the size of servings and the presentation. Excellent flavour for both of us and both of us could not eat the full entree.(Sad to leave some behind.)Staff extremely attentive and friendly. The big bonus was view over bay and city. Highly recommended for value for money
5
I would start this review by agreeing with the last commentator that the staff are far too quick to clear plates while others are still eating . This makes for rushed and uncomfortable atmosphere and a rather fast meal ! Nevertheless we found the food so delicious we'd let it go and still give 5 stars. The fish was wonderful and we sat watching the restaurant staff work so we could see how painstaking was the attention to detail . I recommend the fish Laksa, and the burrata to start was also delicious . Some of the best food in Singapore , a great view and friendly staff - bar that one caveat 
5
We travel frequently and are lucky enough to enjoy dining out in top end restaurants often. Having sampled most of what Singapore has to offer we were looking for something special for our wedding anniversary - the dining room at Spago delivered in every regard. The venue has been nicely designed (note the Terrace/Lounge is very different to the formal dining area) and the menu is a good blend of Spago's Californian roots with an Asian influence. Everything we ate was fantastically well cooked but the stand out point was the staff and service: - A genuinely well-educated sommelier, who was able to recommend a perfect wine based on our discussion. - Attentive and friendly waiting team, who rustled me up the 'secret' off-menu Tuna Cones. - Amazing Executive Chef who is across every meal that goes into the restaurant but also took the time to give us a guided tour of the whole venue including the kitchen. An anniversary we will never forget. Thank you Joshua and teamBen and Trish
5
Great service, delicious beautifully presented food.Went to the more casual bar area with my daughter but so noisy couldn't hear ourselves talk so asked if we could dine in the restaurant. We were offered a seat inside or outside overlooking the infinity pool and beyond to the stunning view of Singapore and the light show. We chose outside. would 100% recommend this experience
3
Of course the restaurant should have it all. Views, location and good names , great menu, backing it all up. Unfortunately in this sort of ambiance it should be truly spotless. Here is our experience:1- Ordered white wine. (Bottle was not cold enough)2- Clearing plates while others at the table were not even finished3- presenting bills without asking if anyone wanted tea or coffee.Probably a lot of 'walk ins' and one time visitors in this restaurant, so its easily forgotten and forgiven by most of the clientele. But for a business dinner (of 4) in terms of service simply not qualifying as 'fine dining'. We had only lunch here. Maybe dinners are a different experience here
5
On the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel so a great view to start. We enjoyed the traditional Spago starters, the beet and goat cheese tower and tuna cones. Great as we expected. I had the oxtail Bolognese, my wife the truffled chicken. Neither of us made a dent in these generous portions. Very good matre d. Enjoyed the restaurant so much
5
From the second we walked in they made us feel special.
Attentive but not pushy
Great recommendations re cocktails
Small but terrific lunch menu (set meal- we didn't have amazing value)
excellent wine list
Would recommend to anyone.
5
Had a very nice dinner with hubby in Feb 17
We shared a entree and dessert and I still couldn't even eat all my main meal
Good size meals and they were all delicious
5
we opted for a 3 course lunch set menu and couldn't have been happier with the meal, attentive service and beautiful warm ambience. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore.
5
We are frequent visitors to the bar and have eaten there quite often; however, we were a bit apprehensive about the fine dinning as we were afraid of being disappointed. Well talk about judging without knowing... we finally said let's do it and it was worth every second of it. Catalin was our waiter and what a professional, friendly and engaging gentleman. He described every single thing, explaining what it was about, without embellishments. Once we conveyed our order, he was very enthusiastic about choices and with good reason. Oh boy was he right!!! We loved what we ordered, we enjoyed that everything had a taste on itself without over powering ingredients competing with each other. The wine was great, the service was exceptional and now Spagos fine dinning is stuck with us because we are coming back!!!

Little birthday lunch with a friend - ABSOLUTE BARGAIN set lunch at $45! First here but definitely not my last!Service - What you would expect, prompt, professional etc, nothing remarkable to stand out against other nice places but my friend had told them it was my bday and they served by dessert with a chocolate happy birthday message on the plate. Nice touch. Food - Tuna tartare with Japanese flavours - Excellent!! As was the chicken laksa spring roll - Happily eat those again! Korean salmon for the main and that was gorgeous and beautifully presented, little cubes of pickled radish that were pink so must have been pickled in a bit of beetroot juice. Little slices of pickled cucumber, some spinach, some seaweed rice, korean chilli sauce. So yummy, big flavours, fresh, crunchy, sour, spicy, and salmon - Result! I wasn't keen on the Iberico pork.. bit boring, with pureed parsnip and pumpkin and I just didn't find it special, the kind of food I cook at home on a Sunday.. also maybe a bit salty.. But, the passionfruit coconut mousse, meringue thing - Redemption!!Tips - Views are amaze from the bar, great location for sundowners. Do check the price list tho, I found out the Aperol Spritz I happily enjoyed several of on my last visit are $40 a pop..oops.. Also directions, MBS, tower 2, you need the right hand lifts which have a sign inside for Spago Level 57, if you don't see the sign you're in the wrong lift!Hmm, bit of feedback on the girls that initially greet you, they need some training. When I arrived I gave the name of my friend for the table booked in the dining room. Typical dozy service you cannot escape in SG, she asks how many people the table is for, I said probably 2, she said it was booked for 2 but my friend is here and said we might be 3.. (At this point I'm rolling my eyes wondering why I am being told this?!), then she looks at the girl next to her and repeats, detailing her confusion... The other girl is on my wavelength, shrugs her shoulders and says it doesn't matter (spot on!) and to show me to my table.. (thank you!) Why I wasn't just taken to the table and why it was so confusing if we were a 2 or 3 I cannot understand.. The table they seated my friend at was a booth for 4!!
5
We dropped in after a fairly long flight and this place is simply stunning. Whoever thought to stick a big boat on top of a few skyscrapers was a genius......I think his name is Moshe. Staff were brilliant and that view over the pool is simply ridiculous
5
Wow! The best chicken I've eaten. Our waited (Das or Des I think) was so professional and helpful. He was great at explaining the different meals to us and had such a kind and lovely nature. It's staff like this who really make your experience worth while. The food was delicious as were the drinks! Would recommend coming here.

Spago is situated on the 57th Floor of the Marina Bay Sands Tower 2 - yes right at the top!It is Wolgang Puck's Michelin Star flagship restaurant.We booked our table before leaving the UK to ensure that we were not disappointed.On entering the Marina Bay Sands building you take the elevator to the 54th floor then from there take another to the 57th floor, where you will feel as if you are on top of the world.On leaving the elevator we were greeted at the reception podium before being shown to our open air table adjacent to the amazing infinity pool.It was a beautiful sunny, hot day with views that were simply breathtaking. You can see for miles from here.On one side you look out over the hotels infinity pool that's only accessible to residents (next time!) to countryside far beyond the city and on the other over the incredible Gardens By The Bay and far away.There are no time pressures and the restaurant very relaxed so walking around enjoying in the view and taking photographs is the norm. There is a well appointed bar in the centre of the restaurant.The staff are extremely efficient and very attentive at all times.The food was outstanding and well presented.Smart casual dress is ok.Having viewed a documentary about the building of the Marina Bay Sands this was an experience not to be missed and one that we will always remember - it was unique.We will return if visiting Singapore again. Next time it would be great to visit after dark
2
The food was full of flavor, the setting and view lovely for fine dining, but the wait staff are in need of customer service skill training and having basic knowledge of the menu wouldn't go amiss.As customary we were asked if there were any foods we could not eat. I advised vinegar which is usually noted with no fuss. On this occasion the waiter demanded to know why, I responded that I'm allergic to it and then he set about pressing me about whether it was all and any kind of vinegar as he reeled off a list of them. My friend eventually said "How about just not adding vinegar to her food at all, thanks". We were quite taken aback by how rude the guy was in this situation - his tone was completely inappropriate.The tea menu was taken off us without staff taking our order. We asked another member of the wait staff to come over and ordered the tea. He said that he would get the menu but we advised him what we ordered was actually on the menu we had already looked at and could he just bring it for us. He looked so clueless and had absolutely no idea what we were talking about we had to get the attention of a waitress and ask her for assistance. Fortunately she was able to take the order.It's a shame that the service wasn't competent and warm because I really did think that the set lunch was good value but there are just so many other fine dining options which aren't such a mission to reach and with at least adequate service with a smile, that I would never bother to return here
5
My wife and I went on a pre-Valentines Day Dinner Date at Spago, located at the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. We found the ambiance very relaxing. The staff were friendly and helpful, often making suggestions, which we graciously accepted since it was our first time. And of course, the food was great. Each item we ordered was delicious. The Fingerling Potatoes, Weiser Farmâ€™s Baby Beet Salad, Pan Roasted Organic Chicken, Crispy Scale Black Sea Bass were all good. And their interpretation of the Kaya Toast is a must-try. It was a bit pricey, as was expected, but the experience over all was great
5
Not many restaurants have a combination of an excellent view, unique menu with very tasty food and first class service. This restaurant is unique. You will remember your visit here long after you have forgotten so many other restaurants.
5
Very good service, especially Valentine! And for sure unforgettable flavours and creations! Thx for a wonderful evening :)
5
Great view, great food, great wine (try the Californian Chardonnay by Wolfgang Puck), great music, great staff
5
Six of us from three different countries enjoyed amazing dishes, a wonderful view and great service. We will be back!
5
Excellent experience at Spago. Very attentive staff without being overbearing. Food quality was very good with generous portion size. Staff had acted on the message at booking that this was an anniversary dinner and made it very special for us - a nice touch!
5
I was recommended to this restaurant by a friend of my daughters who lives in Singapore as a place to eat for a special occasion. It was really lovely night, the food was fantastic, the staff were great and the views of Singapore were amazing (on top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel). Definitely recommended for a special occasion
5
We went to Spago to celebrate a birthday. Whilst i had high expectations, the service we experienced from booking all the way to the end of the meal was outstanding. Everyone was attentive, friendly and professional. The sommelier did a great job of helping us with a wine which we thoroughly enjoyed. We were impressed by the attention to detail and presentation of the mains and starters. However, the desserts stole the show.We are looking forward to our next visit
5
We made a reservation and went up here for lunch. The views were amazing. The meal was beyond amazing. The service was great and very friendly. Would highly recommend this restaurant. I am gluten and dairy free and they accommodated my restrictions, no problem, the gluten free bread was amazing
5
My friend and I dined at Spago this Friday and we had a fabulous evening. The food was spectacular, all three courses that we had were impeccably prepared and tasted wonderful. I the veal and it was unbelievably tender and perfectly cooked, and accompanied beautifully by raisins and pine nuts, and a luscious rutabaga puree. The agnolotti with green pea and mascarpone mousse that I had as a starter, and the passionfruit chocolate dessert were gorgeous as well, and my friend enjoyed her meal equally as much. The portions were very large as well, certainly not typical fine dining sized! I also indulged in the bread service and tried all four options on offer, which were soft and warm and very high quality, my favourite being the cranberry walnut bread. The service was also exceptional, we had tickets to Chicago and the staff made sure to expedite our food and helped us to finish in time to get to our show. They were knowledgeable about the menu and genuinely friendly, anticipating our needs before we even asked for something. It was without a doubt some of the best service either of us have experienced in Singapore. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the view over Singapore from the top of MBS is gorgeous. A truly fantastic experience
5
We visited with friends and this bar has a great atmosphere especially with the infinity pool all round the outside with hotel guests swimming and having fun. The cocktails were amazing all day apparently the drinks our friends had were very cool. Loved this bar......a real experience although did spent far too much money!!!
5
Knowledgable and helpful service. Trust them when they recommend best meal and service we have had on a long time
5
The unbelievable view, awesome food, a most pleasant and efficient staff and a very pleasant atmosphere. And, in addition, reasonable prices. What more could one want? Definitely worth a visit.
5
Beautifully designed, awesome bar staff and Josh as always runs a slick and yummy kitchen.
Love the slight colonial feel to the flooring/decor with the futuristic back drop of Singapores Central Business district...
4
The bread is a bit hard. But overall my friend and I enjoyed the lunch. The place was nice. Staff were nice too. Is a 5 star standard. Leaving a good impression for my China friend.
5
Definitely worth it! The food is absolutely amazing! Will definitely go back! The view is just he bonus!
4
If you are looking for somewhere for a special occasion and for an exceptional evening look no further than Spago. The food was just delicious, with a great wine list to accompany the taste. the service from beginning to end was perfect, just the right amount of attention that you new they were there but only when they were needed. great experience don't miss out.

Great service, great food though it's a little pricey. There again, everywhere else in Singapore especially in such location is expensive too. So, no surprises. Ambience is pretty good too, I must say. Overall experience is still good and worth it if you want to go to a nice restaurant to impress whoever you want to impress! :

This is the perfect combo food, service and ambience. They offered 3 course set menu for $45.- and it was worth! It wasn't busy on Sat lunch I guessed CNY, no one went out! Food was interesting and yummy. Service was attentive, friendly and good attitude. It could be a bit tricky to get up there lev 57 so please allow some time. Laksa spring roll was so delicious as well as my snapper, fresh fish and yummy Asian green. Dessert was also gorgeous. The portion size was pretty generous, we were very full when we left. My partner ordered Beef burger which was great but he would like a bit more of chutney or pickles to make the whole burger experience. Wine was quite expensive, to the lighter side and not too many choices to choose from by the glass
5
We booked online for our Golden wedding anniversary dinner and as soon as we arrived where made to feel special we ordered pre dinner drinks and the waiter returned with them and also gave us an anniversary card signed by all the staff the food was delicious and shared desserts where served at the table on plates that the pastry chef had written Happy 50th Anniversary in chocolate as a surprise for my wife which I had arranged on line A special night and one to remembe

My husband and I were originally going to stay at the MBS but I realised after much research that we really only wanted to see the famous, rooftop pool without the need to swim in it. Then I found Spago's along with a direct view of the rooftop pool and being a fan of their other restaurants I made a reservation in a blink. I asked for a table in the Terrace Lounge with a view of the pool which did not disappoint. The staff were exceptionally attentive and the food was fantastic. We loved the tuna cones and salmon salad and my husband loved the burger.Somehow the staff got wind that it was my birthday and surprised me with their signature ice-cream Kulfi pops. It was such an unexpected, kind gesture and it truly was a highlight of our trip to Singapore. Thank you all so much for the great memories..... life is short, and with so many places to eat we were so glad that we found this one as we travel the world

Service attentive.
Food lovely.
Very expensive food and drinks.
Salted caramel soufflé was lovely.
Fillet Mignon starter very good.
Ambience was nice, good selection of music playing throughout the evening.
5
Love everything about this place. My favourite spot in the world. Exquisite, elegant and service is awesome.
5
The best breakfast I have ever had! Excellent salmon, pancakes and raspberry jam! The service was very good and the view was breath-taking.
5
We first ate at Spago on Friday night, 1/20/17. We had such an amazing dinner that we decided to return for the Chef's tasting on Sunday. It was an experience that we will never forget. Chef Greg Bass was so creative with his textures and flavors and each course had such a wonderful presentation. Catalin (sp?), our server, was top notch and a consummate professional. Our sommelier suggested an excellent bottle of barolo wine that carried us through the 10 courses. In addition to the culinary extravaganza, the location on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel could not be any better. The view was breathtaking. If you find yourself in Singapore, Spago is a must see
5
This restaurant is amazing! Everything from the service, food, location and the ambience. The sliders and burger were amazing. The quality of food can be tasted in every bite. The manager came by to check on us as well. Oviolius was our server. He was amazing he constantly checked on us to make sure we were ok. He explained the menus and portions. The ambience was amazing. Great skyline pictures on one side and the other side great pictures of the harbour and the grove trees. Great at sunset for pictures. Would highly recommend!! Been to a Spago in Maui and service was similar - excellent and high quality
5
We had the pleasure of having the 3 course set menu lunch. The flavours, presentation and taste of the meals was fantastic. The service as would expect was first class. The views from up there at the 57 floor are simply stunning. The quality of food, service, that view, made for great value. I will be back next time in Singapore
5
We had a fantastic experience at Spago restaurant. One of the best meals ever had and that is a lot to be said. Our server Catalin was amazing, his service was perfect. I had the veal tartare to start with and mokfish as main that was to die for.so beautiful and tasty. Both were professionally done and melting in the mouth. I really can't say enough about what a mind blowing experience this was
5
We were staying at the Sands, sitting by the pool and saw Chef Wolfgang Puck walk by! So we knew that Spago would have the A team cooking. WOW did they ever! The truffle chicken was fantastic and the service was top notch. My glass was never empty and I left with a full belly.
5
I booked lunch for my parents for their 39th wedding anniversary. They were delighted with the food, decor and service. The card signed my the team and the surprise dessert at the end truly made the experience unique!I could pay on their behalf with my credit card without being physically there.The overall experience were amazing! Thank you
5
Had dinner there last night and were impressed with their food, wine and service. Everything was delicious, beautifully presented and cooked to perfection - thank you chef Joshua. The wines were great, having one of the best and most extensive wine lists in Singapore. The service was also impeccable - thank you Cătălin. Last but not least I had the most amazing gluten free bread- moist light fluffy and super tasty. Can't wait to be back there again. Stellar experience.
4
Simply amazing food and service
Everything was absolutely delicious.
The staff were also very attentive to minor details
Would definitely eat here again
5
Fantastic evening, food was excellent and the service outstanding, many thanks to Catalin who made the evening so pleasurable!
5
We came up for lunch and came back for dinner. This was one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. It's very cool fine dining with the outstanding food and service delivered with a great soundtrack - not to mention the views.... Greg Bess and his team really looked after us superbly. We can't wait to go back when we are next in Singapore
4
Really wanted to see the infinity pool I wish we could swim in it! Went for drinks anyway. Snuck in some pictures. Considering we were able to take pictures and have drinks I think it was a little bit more worth it to go here than just the observation deck.
5
We only came up for drinks, and first of all, the ambiance sitting at the bar seems to trump dining at a table. It was beautiful with the view of the pool and sitting up a little higher helped us feel the breeze better. We had the best bartender Hermes and he made us a few cocktails each, 3 of which weren't even really on the menu, he just made them to suit what we were after and they were DELICIOUS. We chatted with him a lot and it felt like we had our own private bartender. I noticed all the other bartenders were equally friendly and willing to go above and beyond. The customer service is what really impressed us because there were some guys next to us and somehow they starting throwing water and it got all over our table area and phones. We didn't make a fuss but the head bartender (I assume) was very quick to come over and apologised insisting they will take care of us. I was expecting some kind of 20% discount or a free round of drinks or something basic like that but when we got up to leave and asked for the bill they said it was on the house! We were blown away. We didn't expect it at all and it really solidified the genuine feeling we got from the staff all night. Can't say much about the food since we didn't eat.
4
Eating here was a great experience. We were sitting outside overlooking the pool with a view of the Skyline. The service was friendly and very knowledgable about the items on the menu. We were all very happy with our choices. The style can best be described by western food with international influences. I would certainly eat here again when in town
4
We went here for my birthday, which was recognized very nicely. The food was wonderful. The wine collection is extensive and very expensive. The only small thing was the seating. We were seated next to the kitchen and I expected to have had a nicer table since we had reserved in advance and it was a special occasion. All in all, it was a lovely and memorable evening and we would definitely recommend it to others
4
This place has incredible views but I would consider it grossly over priced. I guess you are paying for the view but they should really have better service and deliver what was ordered. I had the burger which would have been great if they would have listened and not put mustard on it. A Saporro beer for $15 including service just seems a bit steep even for this sort of tourist destination
4
I like this place. The vibe and service are great. Food is better than good. As picky as I am, I cannot find a fault with this place. Everything is executed to a high level. The only complaint is that I was "relegated" to the bar and lounge section and they won't seat me at the restaurant section because I have a 7 year old child. This child policy is a bit of a double edged sword.
5
To quote the title of Master Chef Wolfgang Puck's book, "Live Love Eat", I came here for lunch and fell in love with the view. Seated at the al fresco terrace lounge, overlooking the loveliest infinity pool. It is a cloudy day. The mile long pool is borderless, and the pool waterline merges with the city skyline, into a haze of blues and greys. Had chicken laksa spring roll (definitely a Puck's fusion creation), tagliatelle with Maine lobster and a glass of red. It is good to have lived
4
Dropped in for a drink with friends and the entire city is overwhelming at the 57th floor. Great hospitality and fun service.
5
Went for drinks and dinner on 57th floor. Outstanding view, food, and service. I have always liked Wolfgang Puck, but this is special.

I am a really open minded person, who runs in Germany a large hotel Company and many restaurants; so I got from a friend of mine the recommendation to dine with my board members there. Unfortunately that was not possible, because the front door girl separates people by their appearance and wanted that I have to change my open shoes. Well I was not willing to go the complete way back to my hotel room, additional every Girl and many guys wore open shoes like my CCO, who was able to enter. Wake up Spago, we live in an open world, which should treat People by their inside and not by their outside. I have a tolerant and open minded philosphy, this restaurant definetely not and that I will communicate my guests in Germany. It is really pitty that Wolfgang Puck is a German. Bad image for our country
5
Lovely view from the top of Singapore's most popular landmark. The weekday set lunch is a superb deal. Hot breads are always welcomed, and a good start to the meal. The Chicken Laksa Spring Roll is a must have! Each roll is stuffed with dry Laksa and deep fried to crisp. Service is excellent and warm. We celebrated my friend's birthday there and with advance notice, they put together a heartwarming greeting card filled with warm wishes signed off by the staff. They also decorated the dessert plate with a birthday message. When the restaurant manager did his rounds and saw the dessert plate, he also greeted my friend with birthday wishes which made her feel special.Dress code applies here and a little pricey but the experience will be worth it

My husband and I had lunch here on Boxing Day 2016. Several hours later, I had violent food poisoning. My previous review was removed. This is what happened, I dined here, and several hours later I had the worst food poisoning of my life so I put 2 and 2 together. Hopefully this review is not removed
2
The overall atmosphere is fantastic especially you are sitting at 57th floor with such a scenic view. Unfortunately i have to be honest, the recommended food were nlt impressive at all started with appetizer (very normal), main course (taste weird, it is oily, sweet, salty and buttery) and dessert (too salty). I have high expectations from Wolfgang Puck as i had been to other branch outside singapore and the food was good. May

Wow! This is is definitely a perfect place to have lunch there. But let's go point by point. This restaurant has perfectly trained absolutely professional staff - everything is working like one organism, your desire to ask for something will be noticed immediately! Due to the wonderful taste of every dish this lunch set costs every single cent you spend on it. Tasty bread, uniquely amazing starters, good meat and fish as mains and dessert... Made of I don't know, it is so good that now it is the first in my list of all the deserts in all the countries I have been to!This lunch fits for couples and for formal dinner with important customer or partner.Is it worth visiting and paying 55 SGD per person? Oh yes!

I spent the morning at the Gardens by the Bay and was tired, hungry and extremely hot by the time I made it to the Marina Sands Hotel. In order to get to Spago, you take the elevator to floor 55 and then transfer to the elevator that goes to level 57. It is stunning up there. The views of the harbor with the large boats in the distance are absolutely beautiful . The views on the other side of the rooftop look over the infinity pool towards the city and they are just as breathtaking. Sometimes restaurants with great views lack good food, but this one was surprisingly good. We had the prix fixed menu for $45 a person and it was truly delicious. I ordered the dumplings, but the calamari spring roll my host ordered was even better. I also ate the salmon salad and it was delicious. There were lots of flavors and vegetables and it was extremely satisfying and light--perfect for lunch. The dessert, a coconut trifle was truly masterful!! The only negative was that you couldn't see the view once you were inside the restaurant otherwise it was a wonderful place to relax , unwind and enjoy a beautiful lunch. My dining companion complained that the wine list was overpriced, but that seems to be a common complaint with most restaurants in Singapore. If your taste buds need a rest from Singapore/Chinese fare, this is a beautiful little retreat

My wife and I happened to be in Singapore over our anniversary and I could not have picked a better spot to celebrate it. Before you even sit down you'll have been treated to an incredible view of Singapore on top of this impressive building: the Marina and Skyscrapers blaring at you on the right, and the Bay Gardens in full view to your left. The restaurant is modern but cosy, atmosphere is classy and the service is excellent. It's not pretentious at all which was a huge plus, and the team made us feel welcome and at home with their sincerity and warmness, as well as being attentive (we even got a signed letter from each one of them, for the occasion). The food was one of the best meals I have ever had and I'm not even a fine dining guru or anything like that. Anyone can appreciate that this food was prepared by a master! I had the chef's take on the traditional Kaya Toast, and then a hearty portion of red snapper done Thai style. Portions are a good size too so you are full when you leave. The wine list has plenty of options from all over the world at varying prices.So, it's a bit pricey (I'm converting from South African Rand at 10:1 so you can imagine), but you are not exactly eating at a roadside vendor. You are getting an amazing experience and that includes the people, the setting and just taking in the WHOLE of Singapore painting your horizon while you enjoy a fantastic meal. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a memorable and outstanding evening. I really can't say enough about what a mind-blowing experience this was

We had a wonderful birthday celebration this past weekend at Spago. The food and drinks were delicious. We especially enjoyed the tuna cone appetizer, pasta dishes and speciality drinks. The atmosphere is lovely and it's a beautiful restaurant for entertaining. However, the price point is quite high and we felt the service and food, did not quite measure up to a truly fine dining experience. We would be more likely to come again at lunchtime when the prices are more reasonable for similar menu items. Frankly, most restaurants in Singapore have average to poor wait service and Spago is actually better than most. Though still not up to the standards of other major cities in the world. Anyway, it's a lovely restaurant and a great place to celebrate a special occasion especially on a corporate account
5
we had heard a lot about this place and trust me, it was worth every penny spent! the food and the ambiance were just unforgettable! we were a group of 4 on business and could not come out raving about the place!
4
Nice place for lunch. Good service. Loooooooong wine list (bring your $$ though). Food was nice. We enjoyed a lazy lunch and afternoon here. Look at the harbour rather than the pool...
5
This is a first rate restaurant up on the deck of Marina Bay Sands.
The food is imaginative, delicious and beautifully served.
4
Visited the restaurant for coffee so can't say much about the food. We mainly visited to enjoy the magnificent view over Singapore marina area and the hotel's impressive infinity pool. Service was a bit slow, the atmosphere overall was very enjoyable and to be honest the view just predominates over anything else... Definitely worth a visit
5
We had dinner here on our 2nd night in Singapore. Amazing food & wine & THE VIEW!! We were lucky to dine outside and had the best view in the house. If you are seated in the lounge area you order from a different menu so keep that in mind. Service was impeccable and food was amazing
4
Immaculate service and stunning views ensured our evening would be a wonderful experience. The entrees, a beetroot salad and apple and pear salad, were creatively plated and faultlessly executed. Our fillet of beef for two was as ordered, medium rare, but it was a little tough and perhaps lacking in seasoning. Australian export beef is in my opinion, a better quality.The three cheese mash was under seasoned also and the ratio of cheese to mash needed adjustment. The desserts were a highlight. A light as a feather caramel soufflÃ©, and a rich cheese selection, particularly sumptuous washed rinds finished our meal on a high note. Expert wine pairings. A must do in Singapore if you seriously love your food, but be prepared to pay top dollar
4
Went there last night with hubby and the kids. The ambience of the restaurant and the views of the pool and city skyline were amazing. The food I cannot fault...it was good. One small negative...one of the main waitresses (not the one assigned to us) was a bit pushy in trying to hurry us up to choose what we wanted to eat. We told her that we were deciding out of two dishes and that we would let her know...but she insisted on staying put and help us decide. Hubby then had to politely say that we would call her when we were ready to order. We placed our order with our waitress...but this other lady came back again to ask if we had made up our minds. Bit annoying 
4
Really great restaurant, amazing food and amazing service, staff is very knowledge and recommends great food options with a great hospitality..Do not expect much of a view once you are in the restaurant, but it s okay since you are there to enjoy the food anyway and it deserves all the compliments especially big fan of the staff.Only trouble is the 2 reservation ladies at the entrance. First when we are making reservations personally, they asked interesting questions. Then, they called the room 15 minutes before the reservation to guarantee the reservation, which is fine. But when we arrive, they have question marks, saying they cannot find the reservation and asking us if we are sure we want to eat and not stay at the bar. At this kind of a high-class fine-dining restaurant, you do not want to have this kind of conversation. So, once you pass the confused reservation ladies and are in the restaurant, you can enjoy the amazing food.
5
I'm not talking about the top of the building here, straight to the top of the list of places I have been to. It is a long list, but this just leapfrogged everything!For most people, me included, this is the type of place you might go to once a year. But the list of positives are all up there. The quality of the food, the quality of the service, then there is the view. It isn't cheap, it is just great.Go there, you will not be disappointed
3
On top of Marina Bay Sands it offers a spectacular view on the bay and the city.The menu is limited but offered good food , with a well no surprise-mastered cooking.No pre warning given on the time required for dessert cooking.Although a nice experience it turned out to be a long two lunch exercise for a very good but unsophisticated meal
5
While on our honeymoon we went to spago for our first night in Singapore. The customer service was excellent, staff had a great knowledge of the food and wine. Would recommend to anyone looking for an outstanding meal with a view!
5
Excellent food matched by the excellent & personal service provided by very knowledgeable and attentive staff
The views of the Bay and surrounding landscape are legendary that helped to make our fabulous evening at the Spago very memorable.
4
Nice food with excellent service of personal touch. Has good view overseeing the marina bay sands, nice place to visit.
5
The food is great, staff is friendly & they made nice Happy Bday wordings on the dessert we ordered.
5
This is my second time at Spago, and the food has consistently delivered in term of quality and presentation. I have tried almost all of the rooftop restaurants at MBS, and while they are generally good, Spago offers the most satisfying experience. I think it is because not only the food is great, the view is fantastic too -- it has view of the iconic infinity pool of MBS on one side, and the Gardens by the Bay landscape on the other. Oh, and the interior is very chic as well. My relatives who came along with us were so satisfied with the photo-taking opportunities inside and outside of teh restaurant!The food is excellent. We went for the Tasting Menu and we would like to highlight how good the Sea Bass, Pork Chop and Chocolate-Banana dessert are! The price may seem expensive, but it is still relatively lower than some of its brunch comparables in town.I think I have to single out Janet, the main server at our table, who brought her infectious joy and definitely made the lunch an even better experience. I also would like to commend Valentine and Michael for co-hosting us with smiles throughout the lunch.I definitely will bring friends along more often
3
Thanks to the location sitting atop Marina Bay Sands behind the Infinity Pool, the lounge oversees some amazing views of the city and the Gardens by the Bay, the highlight of the place starts here and ends here. The service is rather poor with servers acting a bit snobbish. The food is average as best in the lounge at least. I can't comment about the restaurant as I could only get a reservation for the lounge that day. The drinks also were not too great in the lounge. So, my suggestion would be to come here for the views, or rather visit Ce La Vie which has better views
5
We went there twice in the last two weeks. First for my wife´s birthday and a week later again. The Food ist outstanding and the service extremely friendly and knowledgable. The view from the two tables in front and outside of the restaurant offers a fantastic view over the infinity pool (only drawback the bathers at all hours) on the Singapore Skyline. The food is California cuisine in the best European way. Definitely try the roasted baby beet salad and the tuna hamachi tiradito - absolutely fabulous. On my wife´s birthday the staff surprised us after already quite stunning deserts with their signature Salted Caramel Souffle - stunning. Not cheap but for a great dinner with excellent service and an impressive view adaquately priced. 
4
the servers were very polite and friendly to us. they explained the menu very well. we were given a round table for 12 people which was very convenient. for their price i expected their food to be extraordinary, but it turns out to be just okay. the caramel souffle is worth the try though!
2
My boyfriend and I went here for a celebratory dinner. At first the hostess refused to seat us at a nice table and after a lot of unnecessary back and forth allowed us to sit at a decent one. Our food was subpar for the price we paid. It's very much so a tourist attraction
5
We visited Spago for my sons birthday. We chose the 5 course tasting menu with matching wines. The food and wine were the best we have ever experienced. The service by the staff especially Ancur was exceptional.My son received a birthday card which was signed by all the staff as well as a dessert that had been personalised.Thank you Spago!
4
Wild location on roof top by pool but dining room a bit too sterile. They put on a show and they care a lot. You get what you pay for. Table were all very happy with food. Soufflé caramel was amazing - yum!
5
The degustation menu was amazing however the Barman Evo, was the highlight of the night! $185AUD pp, but was worth it.
3
After our bad experience with the hotel we wanted to get some energy with food. On the hotel rooftop is restaurant Spago. Food was nice and so were the waiters. This restaurant is also one of the hotel breakfast in-house rooms.
4
The food and service are representative of Spago LA. The location is not convenient.
The chef is quite creative in combining west and east cuisine.
5
Food was delicious and well presented. Staff was warm helpful and warm. The wine service form a long decanter was an amazing experience. We had odd requests if splitting the bills that was handled well by the team . Must visit when you are at SIngapor
5
The cocktail drinks were the best I've tasted ever. The fragrant, aroma and scents of their drinks carefully and exquisitely prepared - consistently & excellently mixed that taste balances and complements ingredients smoothly... was one great experience that will be compelling why I'd go back to SG. This is a must visit in my list again next time I visit to SG
4
I ordered the steak sharing between two. Phenomenally cooked and came with a stringy stretchy cheese mash which was very novel and tasty. The sauce was also pronominal. We sat on the terrace which was nice and cool and relaxed.Definitely recommend this restaurant for the steak
5
Booked this for my wife's birthday and it did not disappoint. We started in the outside bar/lounge for cocktails and then went inside for dinner. The restaurant has a great buzz about it, very personable and attentive staff, and a good menu. As a vegetarian you'd might want to see more options but meat and seafood fans will be pleased.I would't say this is innovative or fine dining but just really good cooking of some classics. (roast chicken, veal chop, steaks, fish, etc). The mains are quite big portions so we skipped dessert and just had a cheese board to finish it off. All in all, it was a great night and would highly recommend. I'm looking forward to come back for more cocktails at the lounge as well and try their menu there
5
If you find Cut a little noisy and would like a quieter relaxing atas place to spend with a loved one, this is it. Food was superb especially their truffle pasta and risotto were cooked to an extremely high standard. Best the gf and I ever tasted so far. Great dessert customization for her Birthday too
3
My wife and I went to Spago for a drink after the skypark.It is one of a few bars /restaurants within the 'Marina Bay Sands' and certainly one with very stylish surroundings and a desirable view over the waterfront promenade.As can be expected, the prices are quite steep, serving as a reflection of the surroundings and the view. However, during happy hour the house cocktail was reasonable value and went down well.The main issue with Spago was the failure of quality service. Having to wait a very long time for orders to be taken and a lack of attentive staff overshadowed the experience.Consider another of the 'Marina Bay Sands' bars for an aerial drink
4
Great food. fantastic view. :
Service was amazing
Downside: we were sitting next to infinity pool was was a put off
4
There are two parts to Spago; the main restaurant and the bar. We only went to the bar. The view was magnificent and we enjoyed a couple of beverages here and a burger which was good.
4
This restaurant places an heavy emphasis on the services, which strengthen the intangible aspect of dining experience!
3
its ok considering it supposed to be of great finese i was very dissapointed to recive my mains of fish luke warm so was that of my dining companion.the staff was very polite and attentive and offered to replace the meals so that made up for it and at the end of the night even though we did not replace our meals we did get our desserts on the house so cant fault the customer service at all. but i was not impreseed with any of the food if im totally honest sorry oh except the cranberry bread a french butter, that was delicious.
5
Wonderful dining experience @ Spago!Food is exquisite especially the wagyu beef and pretty Pastry Chef Ai Li's dessert is awesome too! Dining experience is made even more epic with amazing warm, hospitable service from Reynan Naong & team who took such great care of us! THANK YOU ! They impress us with good recommendation for champagne, wine & food knowledge. SPAGO is a must try beautiful restaurant & lounge in the sky with spectacular stunning view !
2
Been to the Spago in LA for the past 20+ years and have always enjoyed it. HOWEVER, this latest spawn is a far cry from the original. Uppity attitudes and mediocre food. It's one of those additional renditions that should never have happened. The A/C in this restaurant is also barely functional. Constantly perspiring during the meal. Can't say I'll be back
5
We came here for the lunch. The set lunch is value for money. The place is great and the views are gorgeous. I chose to have birthday celebration here for my friend after many happy moments at Cut, MBS, but we wanna celebrate lunch so we chose Spago as they also offer lunch.The food is good, the portion is generous. I particularly like the breads and the desserts. What really impressed me is their service! Besides lighting up a candle on my birthday Friend's dessert, they also made a special custom made birthday card (with my friend's name imprinted on the card!) with handwritten messages. This really knocked my socks off and I was so proud and happy to haven chosen Spago for my friend's birthday lunch.I am planning more trips over to spago.. I am sure about that
5
For such a great restaurant, the $45 limited three course lunch option was incredible value.The venue, service and food were exceptional and CK deserves a special mention.Will tell our friends.The Marina Bay Sands is a landmark in Singapore and to dine on the top floor next to the infinity pool was unforgettable. Mike smit
4
The food is good here , dined at the relaxed bar and lounge. However as is a common thread, the service leaves a lot to be desired. There seemed to be a lot of staff but most of them were more concerned about how they looked than serving the customers.What level of restaurant does not offer water when you sit down!
5
Had a wonderful dinner, started off with friendly hostess, an aperitif at the bar and escorted to the table once it was ready. We opted for the 6-course menu with wine pairings. I forgot the server's name but he was outstanding with a balance of humor and professionalism. The sommelier made excellent pairings and was open for feedback when I told him I found one of the wines too acidic. The food, wine, ambiance, memorable evening
5
What a wonderful restaurant. Both the food and staff were excellent.
Complex flavors that looked so beautiful on a plate. Staff were attentive without being the normal Michelin "stuffiness"
And of course the view to die for!!
Thank you Spago for a wonderful experience.
4
Lunch was nice, food fresh and plentiful. Nice outlook but service is a little slow particularly for drinks. Otherwise no complaints.
5
Service staff is friendly, food is excellent. Great place to bring anyone to have a relaxing and good meal. Definitely one of the best restaurant in Singapore. Sure to return soon.
5
After riding the lifts 57 floors above Singapore the anticipation was very high. And wow, Spago delivered big time. From pre dinner drinks in the bar, to the exquisite service, food and atmosphere of the restaurant, this place ticks all of the boxes. Plenty of great menu choices, but you must finish with the Salted Caramel SoufflÃ©. One of the best desserts ever. This is a very special occasion restaurant, memorable for all the right reasons. Expensive, yes, but the best always costs more. We loved it
5
My Boss and I dined here on our last evening in Singapore after 8 nights and we were not disappointed. The setting the food the service was top notch. I had the duck it was exquisite and we tried some really nice cocktails.Dessert was also great! will definitely go bac
3
Got the impression it may believe its own hype. It was probably one of the most expensive meals I have ever had, and certainly wouldn't be remembered as such. They actually kept us waiting far too long for our table and therefore didn't get off to the best start.I had risotto as main which wasn't very nice. It was an average risotto which wasn't expecting for the price. Couple of steals were ordered and wouldn't have Been as good as the steakhouse.Thing is, it's on the 57th floor rooftop of one of the most expensive hotels in Singapore so expect what you get on that. They were asked to split the bill at the end between a few cards, said they couldn't as it was obviously an inconvenience but then ended up doing it, basically sums it up
5
My wife and I celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary with dinner at Spago on the roof of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. We arrived early and enjoyed a pre-dinner drink at the bar, which was lively and to be recommended. You can also eat at the bar if you are looking for a less formal dining experience.We were then escorted to our table in the main restaurant. The waiters were very friendly and attentive, especially Ivo from Portugal, who provided us with great food and wine tips from his home city of Porto where we plan to visit.The food and wine was also excellent, although the chef's degustation menu was not available that night which was a minor disappointment. There was a large group of people celebrating a friend's birthday at the next table, and they were a little loud. The management were quite observant and politely offered to move us to another table if we wished, but in fact we were happy to stay and enjoy the party atmosphere. But it was nice that they noticed and were keen that our romantic dinner was not spoiled.All in all a wonderful evening, and an excellent location at one of Singapore's iconic venues

We have been coming to Spago's bar since almost the time they opened and have always loved it. We are lucky to be able to visit at least once a week and usually have the same cocktail (not a fan of cocktails but the one we have has converted us). But apart from the drinks or the view or anything else, it is the fact that the whole staff makes us feel welcome, they are incredibly friendly without being fake. They always say that a team can only work if they have a great person behind it and that must be Shah Bahari, she is kind and friendly and warm not only to the clients but also in her demeanour to the staff. Thanks all of you for making our visits so enjoyabl

I love classic cocktails - and among them the Negroni is my favourite. Made in the most classic way, using Carpanno Antica and poured over one block of ice, the edge of the glass first perfumed with the orange peel in the glass.And then yes, you can also enjoy the view - stunning

Hubby brought me here for our 3rd Anniversary. We arrived a little earlier and was taken to the bar to wait while they prepare our table. Gin was nice and bartender and staff were all friendly and nice. We were then seated in the restaurant and the waiter offered some nice advises and choice of food. We had appetizer, fish, veal and some sides dishes. Glad to say that all the food we had ordered were FANTASTIC. The staff put in effort in presenting us with a card that was signed by most of the staff in the restaurant. It was a really pleasant surprise. Although the food is a little pricey, we really didn't mind as all the dishes presented were deliciously and service was great! The ambience was nice and quiet. We really love everything there. The night ended perfectly and we would definitely be back again in near future
5
Classy, sophisticated and elegant. Food is here is superb though pricey (paying for quality is something you won't regret. We came here last May for my daughter's 18th birthday. It was indeed a one-of-a-kind experience for us. The view is amazing. Their cocktails are great.
5
Excellent breakfast buffet and outstanding service. The cappuccino was out of this world ( my wife says). Ask for Lucas the floor manager to take care of you.
5
By far our favorite buffet breakfast for the 7 days we stayed at MBS. Quality sensational selection of food. Excellent management with top notch service. Such friendly, welcoming staff. We've tried the other two options (Adrift & Rise), wished we haven't wasted our time! Spago is the only place to have buffet breakfast in SINGAPORE

Chose Spago as the destination of choice for my mum's birthday because the first experience back in January with my cousins was unforgettable. We got served by Janet this time and she has done a fantastic job explaining every single dish on the menu. She even made recommendations for us as we were spoilt for choices.The best part of this restaurant is that you get a fusion of western and chinese kind of menu. Mainly they mixed Singapore flavours into it. I liked the Laksa Popiah as one of the better dish. Salmon we ordered was slightly overcooked as i prefer it to be pink in the middle, since it was overcooked, it becomes dry and flaky and hard to eat. Seasoning was on point though. Ambience is top notch as you get to have a full view of the sea, marina barrage and gardens by the bay. Do note that they charge for still and sparking water. Ask for ice water if you do not want to be charged and extra few dollars
5
I'm just completely blown away by the experience at Spago's last night. The whole team was at the peak of their performance and the Tasting Menu was one of the best I've ever had. Particularly the combination of flavors with the starter salad: Granny Smith with Japanese cucumbers, paired with yuzu king crabs and Asian pears and with a dressing of shiro-miso and a little Dijon moustard. I mean, c'mon guys, how did you invent this devine combination?!!

The restaurant was located at level 57 of Marina Bay Sands. One had to take the lift at Tower 2 to level 55 before changing another lift to level 57. The restaurant overlooked the swimming with a nice view of the city. I was showed to a table indoor by the window, but the view was blocked by the green. I was having the 3-course restaurant week lunch ($40++). I was served an assorted of bread rolls consisted of mini-sized French baguette and Rustic Italian Ciabatta Bread Roll, stuffed with dried fruits, served with salted and unsalted butter on a marble slab. Both rolls were crusty and soft inside. I personally preferred the ciabatta roll with the salted butter which enhanced the sweetness of the dried fruit's taste.Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones (ala carte $36++/ 3pieces)Chili Aioli, Soy, Wasabi, Shaved Bonito, Scallions, MasagoThe raw tuna was refreshing, combined with the crunchy and slighty spicy cone. However I felt the wasabi taste came across a tab too strong.Soft French Omelet (ala carte $28++)Field Mushrooms, Gruyere Cheese, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Arugula SaladCut opened, the inside of the omelet was filled with melted cheese and soften shiitake mushroom slices. The baby potato's taste was greatly enhanced by the shaved cheese on top.Coconut-Passion Fruit TrifleCoconut Mousse, Almond-Nutmeg Meringue, Passion Fruit CreamIt looked simple, but the taste and texture was a combination of crispy crunchy rice crisp, sour raspberries, rich creamy coconut mousse and creamy almond cream.Finished the meal with a pot of White Tea ($10++), which was light and refreshing. It was served with some biscuits.Overall the food was great. Service was great too with the staffs checking on the food from time to time. The only con was the noisy table of Indonesians sitting next to me, making a headache growing inside me
5
We arrived at Spago, excited and with much anticipation. We were not disappointed. From the view the moment you exit the lift, to the less stimulating but equally soothing view of the sea from our table. Service couldn't be better. We were greeted by most of the staff, and Valentino in particular was cheerful and diligent, attentively catering to our every need.The food was also of a very high quality. The dumplings looked like the usual fare you would get from a hawker stall, but the quality of ingredients was evident and it was delicious. The tuna cone was also really tasty with a nice kick of heat. We had the burgers and they did not disappoint - juicy and succulent. My companion felt that the red onions may have been too strong, but this was not an issue for me. The dessert of coconut parfait with passionfruit was a nice refreshing end to a wonderful meal. Well done, Spago!
5
I came here for a business dinner with my company. It was one of the most memorable dining experiences in Singapore. The location.. , it is on top of MBS so the view is incredible, but one thing that is kinda disappointing is that it faces the pool so you see all types of people in swimwear ... not too pleasant. The food is very tasty and presented well, the service is great and attentive, clean and the decor is hip.The price is on the high end so Im lucky I was able to come with the company
5
I and my wife spent a quiet dinner at Spago. We tried the 5 course tasting menu at the restaurant. Every detail was looked after and the wait staff was quite attentive to our needs. The chef even changed one of the dish given our dietary requirement. Really enjoyed the food and the view. Highly recommended
4
From start to finish, they had great smiling service. We came early for drink (their cocktails are really yummy) and had a night half hour. Service was timed well and on the dot for our dinner reservation, they came to check if we wanted to head to dinner or continue at the bar for cocktails. We set off for dinner with our drinks in hand (given it's all Spago of course they didn't mind if we brought our drinks in). Wait staff were attentive and not stuffy. So I thought it was a nice mix of a bit of family restaurant blended in your fine dining experience. The food was wonderful. I had the kaya toast foie gras - a bit of local taste fused into the menu. And the menu is quite a good selection. It was yummy, and tasted a little bit of peking duck and the toast part was good inclusion of a different texture. I had the sirloin as well later for my main and that was a little well done even though I asked for medium minus so a little more to the rare side. I find American restaurants tend to mean medium is actually medium well. In contrast to European restaurants where medium often is medium rare. Dessert was lovely. The soufflÃ© is heavenly! Oh and note they have complimentary parking even if you valet park. Valid for 6 hours! That was nice!
4
Decently priced cocktails & food with an awesome view of Singapore's business district!
Try their creative mixes of cocktails (had the hibiki mix & old fashion), food wise their chicken bites & laksa spring rolls were great!
5
Great place with great restaurant and good food, good wine list. I recommend and I'll return as soon as possible.

Spago is a place of perfectionism in food, wine and service. Yet here in this beacon of California Cuisine, there is a relaxed and casual approach that let's you simply have fun and enjoy your visit. The superb kitchen is innovative and flexible with mix and match, gluten free and a change of sauce effortlessly accommodated. The fairly priced international wine list has carefully curated strengths especially in California, France and Australia. The highly trained staff are welcoming and informative without being too close. Spago consist of two distinct parts-an air-conditioned restaurant and a large outdoor lounge and bar working seamlessly together and sharing one of the greatest views in Singapore from the 57th floor of Tower 2 at Marina Bay Sands. Let the perfectionists look after you and kick back and have a ball

Promises are too high. early booking went wrong, bad table for two at the entrance. If there would not be the manager Laura, we would have gone. She tried hard to make up for it and she did! Even the meat was not good, we had to chew like there is no tomorrow. Therefor too expensive. Laura made us stay. You could see there was paying a lot of attention to "VIPs"
4
It was lovely to sit at the bar away from the infinity pool at MBS. The pool is super with an amazing view of the Singapore skyline but at 6pm, it was a zoo...totally crowded. Spago's provided a lovely venue to still enjoy the view. The cocktails were delicious although a little pricey (S$26++) but presented beautifully, ice cold and tasted wonderful. It is worth to mention that they come with one larger marvellous rectangular ice cube :
4
We had the tuna tartare cones, laksa spring rolls, squid ink tagliatelle and iberico pork chop. Everything was executed well except the spring rolls which in my opinion was nothing special, especially at this price point. I guess you pay for the service, view and prestige of dining in Spago.
5
Very accommodating service as I wanted to try Spago while in transit in Singapore for 4.5 hours. While it was a risk to rush the experience, it all panned out really well in the end. Excellent and delicious food with great creativity in a timely manner Perfect
4
A great way to see the spectacular view from the top of The Marina Bay Sands and have a nice lunch at the same time. We ate in the outdoor terrace and it was a little blowy when we went, but the view was still great across the Singapore skyline and the swimming pool. We have eaten in Wolfgang Puck restaurants before and again it was very good. My hamburger was delicious with a mountain of fries. Not cheap, but nothing in Singapore is
4
Went here after watching Wicked Musical at the theater. Great location and view, except that the access was not as easy as we would like as you are sharing the elevators with people going up to the pool. Staffs were attentive and polite and food was okay. I am sure they can make improvements on the menu. Would visit again if they updated the menu.
5
It's our first visit to Spago for a birthday celebration. A great dining experience with magnificent garden view from level 57. Despite the place was busy, the staff were approachable and friendly. It was also a great surprise when they arranged dessert with personalized message and drinks for the birthday celebration. Appreciate the kind thoughts and efforts by the Spago team for making it a memorable dinner for us! Definitely a place that I would like to visit again
4
Adult only dining in a fantastic location. Amazing views. Service is very good and food did not disappoint. It is expensive however.
3
Beautiful place. Food was tasty albeit a bit over rated. Tasting menu required for all in the party which wasn't convenient as not all having same appetite size. I'd appreciate if can order ala carte while my teenage son gladly selects the 5 course meal. Service staff were all very attentive & knowledgeable. Citibank 10% promo was not honored for tasting menu. Overall, average experience
5
From the greeting at the desk, throughout the meal and even our post dinner nightcap the service was exceptional.The food was very impressive. I had the snapper laksa and my Wife had the seafood risotto. Both were fantastic.The desserts were also of the highest standards.I was also able to have a very good quality bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc for $100 which in Singapore restaurants is very reasonable.I was very impressed and would return to dine there
5
I had the beet salad that was to die for. so beautiful and tasty. I had the monkfish as my entree which was covered in foam, which sort of through me off for a moment but it was ultimately delicious. Prices are not cheap so be prepared to pay for this edible work of art
5
We had a fantastic experience at MBS Spago restaurant in September 2016. One of the best meals ever and that is a lot to be said. Also the wine was great and service excellent. I had foie gras to start with and lamb chops as main course. Both were professionally done and melting in the mouth. What a restaurant
5
We have been to Spago Lounge many times since it opened, and absolutely love it. The cocktails are delicious as are the "bar snacks", I think we have tried almost everything on the menu and the tuna tartar, sliders and dumplings are our favourites. It's pricey but worth it, and the views are gorgeous. No better place to watch the sunset while sipping a Peace on Earth. Great vibe. Service has improved over the months although it still needs work. We have had dinner in the restaurant as well which was very good and for us the Lounge is a much better option.
3
Our visit to the restaurant was disappointing. The restaurant is located on the top floor of the Hotel Marina Sand, so you pass the infinity swimming pool, and get the view of Singapore from the top. The restaurant itself also had a great ambience. But the service lacked quality, and most of the courses were very disappointing. I would not go back there in a hurry
2
We went here with high expectations because we all love our food, but it was honestly awful..there was nothing that any of the 4 of us ordered that we could say we enjoyed or would recommend. The waitstaff are so busy there's no personal service whatsoever, our waitress was friendly enough but to be honest we just felt sorry for her. We decided not to try the desserts because we couldn't wait to get out of there! Very very expensive and all your paying for is the name, we came out and went and got a burger and fries from a lovely little restaurant because we was all so hungry! My stomach churns every time I think about the food especially the chicken it hadn't been gutted properly and there was red stringy veins through it!! I think we've all been traumatised for life
5
We had the 7 course tasting menu with matched wines. Wonderful experience from beginning to end. Attentive service with great explanations of the food and wines. Met every expectation and exceeded some. Recently a lovely Happy Anniversary card signed by the entire staff a nice, unexpected touch. Special place and recommended
4
First time visiting for drinks and snacks, this place is a must for the decor and lounge seating and the spectacular view of the Singapore skyline (57th floor). The cocktail lost is very Wolfgang Puck and all the drinks fantastic. The food was mixed - spring rolls and hamachi good, sushi and fries have had better.The service was friendly but incredibly slow and inattentive. Our drinks took 30 mins plus to arrive and required a bit of follow up. Felt I was always flagging down a waitress rather than being attended to.This place is expensive ie over SGD 400 for five cocktails and about 5 dishes off the snack menu, but worth every dollar for the view and atmosphere.Move over Ce La Vi..
4
Very high standards , the kitchen does deliver good tasty meals although the only down fall was the floor of the ladies bathroom was wet and dirty obviously from the pool. For such an upmarket place have the toilets checked regularly .
3
Very disappointing with the main course organic chicken, the meat was very tough... Head Chef should always check on the food before it is serve out to the customer.
4
Good burger and lots of fries with an extensive drink menu
Great for the youth for it turns into a night club
Went for the amazing views
Bit pricey but well worth it
5
We went there with some friends living in Singapore...it is the best place to see the panoramic views of the city...plus the drinks were really good.
Go there if you wan to see the city all lighted up in front of you!
4
We went up to the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands to Spago . Undoubtedly the view from the top is unmatched of the city skyline. We had a reservation and was seated on a nice table. We ordered for a gin tonic and one beer. Both the drinks were served promptly. I requested the gin tonic with lot more ice,however the server just turned away without listening to the complete instruction . I walked up to the bar and spoke to him about it. He was apologetic about it.Overall we had a good experience . We did not eat anything as we had dinner earlier at Bread Street Kitchen .If you are in Singapore and want to have a good night out then this place is definitely recommended
5
Me and friend decided to choose this newly opened place for the celebration of 51st anniversary of Singapore and it was a perfect choice. The place is located on 57th floor of the world known Marina Bay Sands and previously it was a closed club for premium hotel guests of the hotel. I would say that the views are one of the best things about SPAGO as from one side you have a stunning view on the Infinity swimming pool of Marina Bay Sands and on the other is amazing view on Gardens By the Bay. Depending on your preferences you can choose restaurant or bar side of SPAGO. Food is really good, service was excellent even the place was packed. I would definitely recommend this place for visiting
4
I went to the outdoor bar/deck section for lunch with friends on a Monday lunch time, also took my 1 month old and a big pram. Staff were really friendly and helpful regarding the pram. We had the lunch menu, which is pretty good value. The food was delicious. Staff were very attentive but in the non invasive way. I saw the actual restaurant on the way to the restrooms and it looks superb. I hope to go back for dinner soon.
4
A highlight of our trip to Singapore, dinner at Spago was simply amazing.Great service, with attention to details like nowhere else, and sublime food and wine pairings. After dinner we had a whisky flight done by a very knowledgeable Adrian, and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The only criticism of Spago is the lack of South African wines, however the ones recommended by the staff based on what we were eating were spot on! The portion sizes were a bit bigger than we expected, and since we are not big eaters, we didn't have space for the delicious desserts :-( Not a cheap evening, but well worth it for a special occasion
5
Went there on my birthday, even got a personalised dessert with a candle. (Not actually requested, staffs initiative). Service was great, could be bit faster but it was a busy night. The food was incredible. That combined with the company made it a birthday to remember
5
If you visit Singapore go here but to the Lounge & Bar part not the restaurant.Brilliant views, lovely cocktails and delicious snacks..seems the place to be so book ahead..The tuna corners (like a canopy) are one of the tastiest things I've ever put in my mouth so try them and the short rib 'steamed buns'It is very expensive though but worth every Singapore Dollar!! Yum Yum Yum!
5
this is my favorite restaurant at MBS. maybe it's a bit pricy but you know what you get what you pay for. absolutely delicious and you can enjoy the view especially in the night !!!
5
The view was stunning on both side of this restaurant and the food really was delightful with big serving. The waiters are very courteous and attentive. We enjoyed every minute of our lunch here.
4
The ambience of this place is just great. The food in general are also very good. Service is fine. Recommended !
3
Right facing the infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands and offering both fresh air and decent views, the place can be fun who don't mind paying big dollars for just about average cocktails!!
5
I was at Spago on the sky deck of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel for an anniversary celebration and made a reservation. The servers went all out to impress and really made it a memorable celebration. Food was excellent as well. We had veal and lobster, both of which were fantastic! Compliments to the chef
5
Visited on the evening of the Singapore GP - food was exceptional - partook in five course degustation - hard to choose our favourite dish - perhaps cucumber and green apple salad but what was also a highlight was the attention from the waitstaff and sommelier great service + sublime food = exceptional experience can't wait to return
3
Absolutely an incredible view of Singapore looking over the infinity edge pool but that's the best part of this experience. Drinks are expensive as you would expect and food was only average. Your not really going here to eat so just have a drink and enjoy the view
5
We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves with the excellent service at lunch yesterday for my boyfriend's 29th birthday. Love the birthday card from the team and the chocolate greetings on the dessert plate. We enjoyed our starters of a tuna tartare cone and the laksa spring roll. Would love to return
5
We went up to the roof bar of the Marina Bay Sands hotel / casino / shopping centre and went into this cocktail bar. The best thing was the amazing views of downtown Singapore. The atmosphere was excellent, food was great with prices that you'd expect. Great plac
4
Food here is as expected from the namesake - there is both the main restaurant and the bar which you can order food from too. I personally prefer to have a few drinks at the bar and order a few table dishes to share. This is a happening place in the evening and a good place to start the evening out
5
A spectacular location, exceptional service (even received a personalised anniversary card from the staff), delicious food, amazing menu, (too hard to choose) and the presentation beautiful. A must for anyone in. Singapore.
5
Had the 8 course tasting menu. Every single dish was superb! The service was amazing. Catalin, especially, was knowledgable and attentive. The entire experiece was special, especially for our birthday celebration.
5
Outstanding food, great atmosphere and exceptional service. This is our Second time visiting and will be back again..
5
The ambience of the surrounding is very relax and comfortable. We enjoy the food very much and the Laska spring roll leave the strongest impression for us and the steam Norwegian Salmon. We are definitely going back again.
5
Supposed to meet with my friends at Celavi (bar from Tower 3), but they were already sitting at Spago. went there and oh boy, it did not disappoint a single bit!!! The place is great, the atmosphere is amazing, the crowd is eye-pleasing. A definitely must-go for tourists on Friday or Saturday evening. i believe their food is good too, haven't had a chance to try. But it's a nice place to hang out. And the view is MUCH better than in Celavi
5
Every single time I go I love it. It's the best bar in Singapore. Views to die for backed up with service and quality. So I don't mind paying a little more. I mean this is really a MILLION DOLLAR VIEW! From the Cashier Chene, to the Manager Mike and all the floor staff its always full of energy and a great buzz. This is the single best place to bring any out of town visitor for a drink and delicious snack at the bar in Singapore
5
Probably one of the best restaurants in Marina Bay Sands (MBS). Excellent service, inventive and tasty food, lovely wine selection and great location. They even exchanged my vague “free MBS champagne” for the champagne I chose rather than the house one I was supposed to have. They could have spoilt the night but they choose the higher ground (the voucher creative/T&C’s were not clear) which showed they valued my service. I would be delighted to return as the food was exotic and delicious
5
Seriously classy, yet accessible. This is a restaurant you'd like to be at when you arrive in heaven. Best if you visit on a cool evening, since you won't want a thunderstorm to spoil your almost perfect view of the city and the bay.The servers are so attentive and you feel like a very important person, as they aim to make you feel like one (so that perhaps you can visit again).The food is great. Clean and fresh. Not gimmicky (since they are on the top of the hotel and I'm sure many would just try to get in for a coffee just to adore the view).The food is serious. Seriously stylish and plated with the greatest sense of artistic.You must eat here, at least once. Before you go to heaven
5
It was superb! Brought my boss to celebrate his birthday here yesterday. They gave him a card with wishes signed by each of the wonderful staff @Spago..Food was great! I loved the gnocchi surprisingly and it was 100x better than anywhere I have eaten.The dessert (chocolate and frozen banana) was excellent!Thank you for making the celebration extra special!Keep up with the great service!Vivie
5
Wow, well where to begin with this place. Located at the very top of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, this place has some serious aesthetic factors going for it! Beautifully designed, overlooking the infinity pool and with panoramic views of the city looking quite like a circuit board at night. We had some fantastic cocktails and enjoyed a selection of ‘tapas’ like dishes from their evening menu especially the laksa rolls! Yum! It is expensive even for a place like Singapore BUT it really is worth every dollar spent because you get the fantastic view, great service (we had a round of cocktails on the house too!) and especially good food. The best we had whilst in Singapore
5
Fabulous food, the Fois gras is to die for !!
Lovely evening with my gorgeous friends. Great venue, wonderful food and superb serviced
4
Excellent Italian waiter! His suggestions were spot on. Birthday card for my wife signed by all the staff was great and unexpected touch as well as the desert. Best meal in Singapore so far.
5
Amazing view. Super friendly crew. Delicious food and fancy cocktails!
I can highly recommend to go there.
4
Nothing about MBS dining will be that disappointing. They have acquired the best Michelin-starred chefs and establishments. Although Spago isn't one of them unlike DB Bistro, it's famed restaurant likened that in LAX earned its fair share of localised cuisine to local taste buds. Fancy a local 'kaya toast' served in a fine dining plate, all deconstructed! Very interesting dining concept and food. Service is typical of a fine dining restaurant, nothing utterly impressive. For the view, we were given a 'window' seat but were fully blocked by planters outside. Not impressed
5
The Restaurant is located in the second tower of the Marina Sands bay, Very nice selection of drinks and fine food , They have a few table at the outside terrace .. Take a drink at the terrace toward the end of the day 10:30 and you will be able to view the infinite pool and the city .
5
A friend was in town last night and suggested Spago. We don't normally eat in "Celebrity Chef" restaurants as we find them good, but generally overpriced. While Spago can be expensive, especially with some of their better wines included, it was very worth it and we will definitely be back. We shared three starters, the tuna cones, veal tarter and octopus. All three were so different and so excellent and unique. I then had the halibut laksa which was laksa, but so much more. I love laksa and the way it was done with a small amount of broth, noodles and delicious fish was a first and I will have to try again. We all enjoyed the meal and the quality of the food, preparation, taste and service all mean we will be back! Can't wait
5
it would be easy for Spago to serve mediocre food as the location is just unique and makes it worth a visit but the food is one of the best I have eaten in a long time. Food quality and originality are of very high standards: laksa rolls, tuna tartar cones, salmon salad. The staff is diligent , the food is served at the right pace and the surroundings are unique.If I had to suggest one improvement, the menu could provide a bit more choices
5
My wife and I celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary there and the staff at Spago did not disappoint. We were welcomed with a personalised congratulations card signed by the staff on the night and the service from there was impeccable. So was the food! My foie gras to start and quail for main were exceptional (particularly the foie gras) and my wife's gnocchi and chicken were also stunning. Peach mielle feuille for two to finish and we were stuffed with glorious food! Preferred it to L'Atelier de JoÃ«l Robuchon where we had lunched earlier in the day.
4
Service was excellent especially from Mr Catalin. Food presentation was great and prices are great especially for a fine restaurant. My wife and I were treated well as were celebrating wedding anniversary. The only issue was that I was told that long pants and collar shirt are a must but there were some guests in bermudas and t-shirt. Why the double standard
3
We had diner last July and the view was just astonishing. Unfortunately, our meals were note as good as expected (considering the place et the price!).We had gnocchis that were overcooked as well as salmon ... Definitely, cooks need to follow a new trading for italian best cooking.The wine was really expensive compared to similar places in Singapore
5
Went there to celebrate my 29th birthday and it was truly a memorable experience! The service was impeccable and the food was AMAZING. Would definitely go back there for seconds (and thirds!)
5
Love the service, the food was good, the price is on the high side but it was reasonable for the location itself
3
One of my favourite restaurant but the logistics of going up is very unpleasant taking the same lift with hotel guests who are still wet from the pool or wearing slippers and towels when the restaurant guests are nicely dressed.
5
We only went to the bar for cocktails and Azrol was so friendly and his advise on the cocktails was like telling a story of how the cocktails will taste, great time was had, thank you
5
Foods were excellent and service was excellent. All the foods were impressive. We went there for foie gras but the dish was serve only for dinner. A meal here doesn't come cheap but it"s worth every dollar.
4
Located on top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Fabulous views in all directions. Dined on terrace adjacent bar. Casual and comfortable. Slow service. Good food, but not good enough for the price point, and not quite up to famous Mr. Puck's reputation. Can get a better burger and fries in the US at a far cheaper price.
5
We decided to visit this amazing restaurant for our 10 year wedding anniversary and it was a delightful choice. My husband had the lobster and it was just outstanding. I had crab risotto which was also cooked perfectly . It was a fine dining experience but not stuffy!! We were there to have fun and celebrate and I think they picked up on our vibe and were relaxed and fun to be around ... Views are incredible as the sun sets and then a cocktail next door in Spago roof top bar was a nice way to finish off. Will certainly visit again next time we are in Singapore . Highly recommend . Fancy without the smancy!!
1
We went here couple times during our stay because it is at the top of the Marina Sands hotel and it seemed cool, however the service is just terrible. Yes they are at the top of an amazing hotel but that doesn't automatically means that guest should put up with horrendous service and pay for it. Eat from the pool menu or go downstairs to the many other good choices....We went there for lunch and the waitress was rude, messed up the order so bad to the point that we only had drinks and an appetizer. We wanted no more pain during our beautiful vacation to Singapore, so we canceled the rest of the order. Then, we wanted a romantic dinner and thought that maybe lunch was just one bad experience, but nope... For dinner, it was early in the night and saw lots of drunk biligirent guest upon arrival, again the waitress was rude, messed up the order and again food wasn't delivered on time... I guess they want you to drink up and starve so that by the time you get the food, you might enjoy the food... It is super pricey for what the menu offers.... We ended up going up to the front to try to pay because nobody came and checked on us for about 35 minutes... Even after they found out we were leaving disappointed, they did NOTHING to remedy the problem and were happy to charge the cc....This is not the first time that Spago has been a terrible restaurant experience for us... Spago in Beverly Hills, Spago Maui, Spago Vegas has ALWAYS been the same bad restaurant experience. Either couples lunch or dinner or large groups experiences have been mediocre, frustrating, understated and a waste of time. We are done with Spago Wolfang Puck forever

On the way to the famous infinity pool for an early morning swim on top of the hotel we passed the desk for Spagos ( they were open for breakfast) and spontaneously booked for dinner.Dressed for dinner we ventured forth for dinner at the top of the town.Words fail me Service impeccable View of Singapore spectacular. Food fantastic. Entree of choice were hand made brandy snaps formed into cones containing fish and wonderful seasoned meat.Steak tartare was on offer and was delicious. Roast duck was succulent and cooked to perfection crispy on the outside pink on the inside.Angry lobster screamed try me and did not disappoint. Spicy whole maine lobster was presented in the shell and the waiter requested permission to prepare the lobster and expertly removed the tender meat from the shell. The performance enchancing the occassion.Finish with two cheeses choosen from an impressive cheese board they we tasty and quality.Just to be different souffle was the dessert I chose. Our waiter advised that the chef had rejected the souffle that had been prepared and would make a new souffle and this would take about 20 minutes. No problem on holiday glass of wine in hand and a million dollar view the time flew by. Mentioned to the waiter the everything had been terrific and could he pass my compliments the chef I was surprised were the chef came to table we were ableto thank her personally for making the night a success. The night was not cheap but was worth every cent and is plsce revisit.

The infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands Hotel may only be used by hotel guests, but you can enjoy a drink right next door at Spago, overlooking the pool and the city’s skyline. The open bar reminds one very much of a terrace at a cozy cottage. It is open to all sides and equipped with comfortable sofas and flat tables. However, you don’t necessarily have to watch the mermaids splashing around as from the other side of terrace you have a fantastic view over the Marina Bay. Those who wish, may also have a little chitchat at the bar.When we went, we only tried the cocktails, which were truly delicious. We did take a glance at the food menu and it all sounds great. Next time we go, we will definitely have a bite
5
Impeccable service and food where portions for the lunch set was filling.
The view of the Singapore skyline was a plus too.
5
Very nice restaurant,good cuisine, amazing service. The restaurant is located on the 57th floor, so you have a view over the Marina Bay Sands pool and the Marina Bay.

My husband and I just ate at Spago a couple of nights ago and Wow! The food was and service were both incredible! We love to visit Michelin star restaurants when traveling and Spago truly lived up to its 2 stars! We did the chef tasting menu with wine pairings and every dish was exciting and incredibly delicious! I loved that the dishes had very classic elements but with a local twist. We will absolutely without a doubt will be back the next time we are in Singapore!
5
I think you have to be a guest in marina bay sands to eat here, but it is so good! Their seating, drinks, and food is so delicious!!! Trust everyone when they tell you how good the salmon tartare is!! And try the peace on earth drink! What I would do for one now! So good

I wrote a review in January, I had a great experience at Spago and I really like sitting in the outside bar area. Fast forward 7 months and things have changed a bit. Dont get me wrong, Spago continues to have great food and I dont mind making my way through the minefield on the ground level of MBS--passing all the tourists in beach wear and robes from the pool to get to the restaurant. There were two things that have changed. First of all the prices have gone up. Its understandable you open with reasonable prices then put everything up when you get the clientele. I still don't mind paying because the food is always good. But the one thing that really annoys me now is the service. It has changed a lot from my first visit. The service is now what I call 'at will' service, which means they will come when you call them. There are a lot of people around and someone is always close by. But why do you need to call someone for drinks? Or a beer glass when the beer comes with no glass for your lady? Or when you want to order something? On my first visit it was much more proactive, there was always a smile and a question 'can I get you anything?' but not this time. And the final straw was when I paid with my AMEX credit card, a thick accent from abroad comes running back with my card and says quote unquote 'your card no good, you have another one?' I told them to try again, and there was no problem but by then the damage had been done. Maybe after a few months of letting the steam subside I may return

I took my wife for an amazing birthday dinner celebration. It was just the two of us on a long overdue date night away from the kids and it was well worth the money we spent.We decided to have the chef's selection of with wine pairing... it was wonderful and so was the service!Not Cheep ! but it was a great night and we will be back!

We were staying in tower 2 of the Marina Bay Sands and decided for a casual dinner with a friend. We paid SD$733 for 3 mains, 3 starters, 2 desserts, a bottle of rosÃ© (an ordinary Cotes d'Aix at $105), 2 beers, 2 juices and a glass of Prosecco. The food is a creative combination of very tasteful flavours, the service is very good and the atmosphere in the restaurant is a bit quiet. The bar area is definitely more entertaining than the restaurant. We had a lovely evening but 2 of us left a little hungry even though we'd had 3 courses

Spago is Wolfgang Puck's second venture in Singapore (after the Steakhouse called CUT that is also located at Marina Bay Sands). Just like CUT, the early days of its operations are very promising. The Spago brand is supposed to be the flagship of Puck's impressive restaurant empire with the "mothership" being based in Beverly Hills.The location is certainly hard to beat although your journey to Spago will be via multiple lifts at MBS, forcing you to change along your way up. The reward upon arrival is a great view and a cozy but fresh ambiance that fits very well to the Californian culinary theme. The venue: Tables are spaced appropriately, however, a word of caution - if you are seated near the entrance you will experience Singapore's humid climate every time somebody opens the main door. The Food: Spago's friendly and competent service team will swing instantly into action upon being seated and food as well as beverage menus are a delight. The Californian cuisine receives some "Singapore twists" recommendations include "kaya toast" as well as "Laksa". The kaya toast option is a great starter but one can also indulge in fresh tuna tartar or grilled octopus salad. For mains, a nice selection of seafood dishes and meats are available. Our table opted heavily towards seafood and the cod options did not disappoint. The veal chop was another fantastic choice but we sadly missed out on the lamb (only so many dishes one can sample...). The sides are truly remarkable and you'll rediscover your love for vegetables again! But leave enough space for dessert.The Caramel sea salt souffle was the favorite of the table but the frozen nougat also disappeared seemingly fast. The Beverages: Spago has some stunning wines available including hard to get labels and those will complement your dinner experience perfectly. The Service: The service crew looking after us performed very well. Constant refill of beverages, well timed delivery of meals and clearing of plates, combined with a relaxed approach and humor made the evening very enjoyable.The Music: The only serious negative was the the volume level of the background music that was "not so background". Three times we asked to lower it and succeeded finally and were able to have a proper conversation without raising our voices.Summary: Spago is well worth a visit - as a matter of fact it may be one of top venues in Singapore at this point and time. One can only hope that the team stays as motivated as they were during our visit and that the quality remains on the same high level as experienced

I have celebrated my birthday in this restaurant. Staff was very friendly and prepared the special gift for me - letter signed by the whole restaurant's team. During the dinner everything was of the highest quality: food, wine selection and service. Particularly, I have tried the best burrata in my life. Restaurant's location on the top of Sands hotel is also great, but actually the view from the tables is not impressive. However, it is still a fantastic place to have a dinner
4
The view and food quality dictate the price and it is worth it. Not often I will say it is worth paying $15 for a beer and $30 for a sandwich, but with the flavors and awesome view it is worth it. The service was ok too, however the servers seemed to only care about my partner and basically ignored me when ordering. Interesting
4
I organized a team lunch there yesterday and my team had a really great time. Food is yummylicious and everyone feel relaxed in the setting. Food portion is generous and definitely worthwhile! We are grateful to CK's hospitality and his team's attention. Good job guys!
5
at the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel (57th Floor), renowned chef Wolfgang Puck...food and service excellent and views...great would come back
5
Great location, view and ambience
Good wine selection and menu.
Slow braised beef rib is a must try entre.
Reasonably priced for a special dinner occasion.
Excellent service!
5
Ate here for a business meal and the service was beyond anything I've experienced before. They were accommodating, friendly and were happy to assist in every way possible. I was so satisfied with the service I came back for a week later.
5
A fantastic way to spend our last night at Marina Bay Sands. Food was outstanding and wait staff exceptional (without being intrusive). Thanks for a great night.
5
staying at Marina Bay Sands, the mega hotel, we rocked up for a quick drink & bar snacks for dinner with the family.Our hostess was just fantastic, drinks & food were all great. The kids loved the hamburgers, they were bloody good! Prices ok for where you are.the whole experience was just brilliant. go with an open mind, connect with the staff, they work hard & enjo
5
The setting was beautiful - on the top of Marina Bay Sands Hotel 57th floor. The view through the glass on either side of the restaurant was breathtaking at sunset. The food was excellent. We loved the "kaya toast" - seared foie gras with pandan coconut jam & toasted brioche. The Chirashi Sushi starter was a meal in itself - like a palette of artistically placed sashimi with drops of yuzu gelee. Next was the Hand cut Agnolotti filled with mascarpone and sweet pea - such a delicate flavour. We shared the USDA Prime Cote de Boeuf for 2 and it was perfect! Service was excellent. Definitely the place to go for that special occasion

Spago at Marina Bay Sands has a lot going for it: a killer view from 57 storeys up, a delicious menu & friendly professional service. I was seated at the bar as I was told the restaurant was full. My peeve was that there were empty tables at which I could have been seated. Also the hostesses tend to seat too many parties side by side at the bar so much that it felt constraining & cramped. This hiccup aside, I had a good meal during my visit to Spago. For starters I had their signature tuna tartare cones which were just the right amount of sweet & salty. Bread service was lovely too with an assortment of house baked breads & two kinds of butter. I selected the New York sirloin & asked for it to be done medium rare. Although the steak had a nice char on it, it was cooked a bit too long & thus came out medium well. There was a nice accompanying side of potato gratin as well as a lovely thick gravy, full of sticky beefy flavours to pour over the dish. Chargrilled brussels sprouts were a nice accompaniment. Dessert was a delicious chocolate earl grey mousse. Cooking was skillful & all in all, the experience was pleasurable. At SGD 300, this would have to be reserved for those special occasions.

Firstly, Spago offers a great view from the top of MBS. You get to see Garden by The Bay n out to the sea or the skyline of Sibgapore n watch the sunset. Or, u can watch the pool goers dip in the pool just in front of the restaurant! I tried small bites when I went there. Love the fried chicken cubes, King Crab sushi n Laksa popiah roll! Tried a couple of cocktails as well. I'm a huge Mojito fan. Haven't really found a decent Mojito in Sg yet. Mojito at Spago is pretty alright. There is a cocktail with peach tea n Vodka. Shiok! This will be the place to go if u feel u need a quick paradise getaway.

The lunch menu here starts from 55 or 95 bucks and the choices are great. there are a few dishes with require supplements. however, the top ups are well worth the money. in particular, the salmon with rice was a very nice dish. and from the bottom of my heart, the view of singapore from the 59th floor was amazing.i think this is a good restaurant for a romantic lunch. The only problem is that dinner is much too over priced and the service can be a little stuffy
5
Loved this restaurant; great food and exceptional service in a top location. Highly recommend you give it a try.
5
Go to Tower 2 at MBS Hotel. Then change at level 55 to go to level 57 where Spago is. If you haven't come here to see the night view, you have not seen Singapore ! Waiters are very friendly. Chilling out with ice cold beer and fresh air blowing in your face overlooking the island city is simply out of this world ! If you are on budget, just order one glass of beer.I tried the california roll and it was good. Serves fusion food. Great for group of 4-5, not too big a group
5
Loved it absolutely! The impeccable service throughout dinner was very much appreciated!On top of that, the location was lovely on level 57 of Marina Bay Sands!Portions are large, do take the suggestion of the servers if they indicate that you should share an appetiser (which I didn't heed, thinking I can do one portion by myself)Served by Captain Catalin, he was a funny dude and provided very prompt and appropriate service.Manager CK was super sweet to take note that we recently got married and even wrote us a nice greeting card
3
If you are from a meat continent then no need to visit. Be careful of a young French wine so-called sommelier who will come to your table with the he prime objective to upsell and rip you off.Food is OK. But for this price you can get it in a million other places
3
Food was really at best average. The hamachi salad was good but very expensive for very few slices. Roasted chicken was gigantic - more than a ladies portion. Miso cod - normal taste and big portions. Appetizers were expensive for what we got. Would not come here again.
5
The restaurant is a true fine dining experience . The moment you walk in you will really understand that everything will be perfect . Classy expensive but everydollar is worth it . The staff the chef everyone work to be the best and to impress !!! The place is not a tourist trap is a place for people love food and wines . The menu ' is very creative and you will not disappointed . Next time I will try the gourmet dinner menu ' .

Converted from the previous Club house, nice view of the pool outdoor (people in bathrope walking pass spoilt it abit). Lovely warm ambience, good service, food was good but not excellent. The duck and pasta was great, burata salad was pretty and the salmon was over cook (eventhough we were recommended this dish).Supposedly better than CUT, but it wasnt. If we were dining at MBS, i would not be in a hurry to come back again. Worth a try though.
4
Top of the world, literally. Great views from this rooftop bar - the sea on one side and Singapore on the other side. Drinks are not cheap but you pay for the view. Also viewing the people in the pool taking selfies is lots of fun
3
Been twice for lunch since it opened and I was initially so impressed by the view and bright, airy ambiance that I may have been biased in favor of the food. Admittedly, the food isn't bad, it is competently executed, but lacks character. Perhaps their effort is reserved for dinner, but I am unable to judge that. Their lunch, however, gave the impression of a chain restaurant with good quality control. My more recent meal was less colored by the atmosphere, partially because the restaurant is much more crowded than it had been when it first opened and they now, for some reason, have decided to ruin the mood with overly loud pop music. The service is good and as I said, the view itself makes the restaurant worth the lunch--I am skeptical that it is worth the dinner
5
My friends and I had a great time in Spago. The staff provided us with wonderful service.We also had a great selection of food that exceeded our expectations. My favorite was the Kaya toast and spicy tuna cones! I'm glad that they were able to prepare 'mimosa' for my cocktail even if it's not listed in their menu and it tasted good as well not to mention its sleek and sexy glass.I'll definitely recommend Spago to my other friends for their future dining experience
4
Its the place to party in Marina Bay Sands. Right by the infinity pool, this Restaurant offers amazing cocktails. You can view both the Marina Pier, Gardens by the Bay and Merlion from here.
5
My wife and I had an excellent experience at Spago! The location offers a great view of the city, the staff was was very helpful, and the food was beyond amazing! We will be returning soon.
5
Memorable experience. Really tasty food served in very generous portion. Looking forward to be back there again.
5
Loved this place great food great cocktails great location great scenery. Everything is fantastic.
Great staff whose recommendations are brilliant.
Only negative check your bills we had an overcharge of a few items.
Highly recommend the lychee cocktail yum!!!!
4
It is a lovely place to have an evening drink with the view of infinity pool. There is no menu for mocktails but you can ask the friendly staff to suggest you good mocktails.Drinks are as expected are in the price range of medium to high but it is worth the experience
5
As part of our staycation plan, we decided to have dinner at Spago. We had read so much about it and were very eager to try it.We were not disappointed! Service was amazing, staff were very attentive and very quick to respond to our requests. Ambiance of Spago was nice, gentle warm lights, candles and great music, it gave off excellent vibes. The quality of the food was well worth the price and it was really fresh. We really loved it and will be back again
5
Fantastic experience time and again. We stumbled upon Spago one Saturday afternoon whilst looking for a nice place to have a coffee and watch the sunset. It was a serendipitous encounter and we have been frequenting the establishment ever since. Admittedly drinks aren't cheap particularly cocktails, but I'd say they are worth every penny. Bottle service makes more sense here. The view is stunning as you can see both sides of MBS and the service is the best I've experienced in Singapore. Everyone is very helpful and kind particularly the bar staff and cocktail artists, they put a lot of care and effort into making intricate and delicious cocktails that delight and surprise.Highly recommend it for groups or a romantic date
4
Just finished lunch here, had their business lunch and 4 course lunch. Overall friendly and great service! Seeing that we are sharing our lunch, they offered us the options to share our 1st and 2nd course. Main are pretty huge in portion. View is spectacular especially when we are dining on the TOP. Wines prices are friendly and well curated List.
5
This was a great dining experience! I was lucky to come with someone who is a regular so maybe that was part of the fantastic service we experienced, but I have a feeling it is great no matter who you come with. I had the new rabbit dish as my main and it was absolutely perfect. The wine list is incredible and the view is stunning. Not for those afraid of heights but definitely worth conquering your fear for this meal
4
Stopped in after hearing all about the amazing views from the top of the Marina Bay Sands and were not disappointed. Not only is the view absolutely stunning (city views framed by a glorious infinity pool, a Birdseye of Gardens at the Bay, and the waterway), but the bar itself is exquisite. The service was lacking and our cocktail waitress took a long time to get to us for initial orders and then even longer for a second round. With cocktails over $20 each, I expect that the bar is well staffed and I'm not waiting around. Drinks were good, but not great and not expertly prepared. My mom enjoyed one of the signature cocktails and it was great, but other drinks we ordered were too strong or not flavored quite right. Worth the experience though a million times over.
5
A World Class experience - absolutely nothing to fault, food quality, friendly and knowledgeable service team - our dining companion commented the best meal he had had in 26 years in Singapore so happy to defer to that !
4
dined with friends at spago one evening. everything was absolutely delicious and service was stellar. we chose salads to start and fish as our main courses. beautiful presentation, perfectly prepared and falvourful.
totally enjoyable evening

Person1: 我點了一份牛小排，份量很夠很好吃。我們的服務人員是Catalin，非常親切隨時都有注意到我們的需求，餐廳的環境舒適，推薦給所有的人。
Person2: I ordered the 'Honey Miso Broiled Black Cod' and it was scrumptious, but the dressing was a bit over the top. I must give our server, Catalin, a shout out. He was attentive.

Went to Spago in the afternoon for a few casual drink's.. Wasn't really hungry.Once at the 57th floor, elevator doors opened.. Bada Bing Bada boom.. 5 or possibly 6 stunning hostess's where busy chatting. Felt like spring break.. kinda overwhelming. Moving on..I wasn't greeted to start with, asked for a table at the bar and was escorted to my seating choice. Bar Staff, especially one, i believe he was from Penang, Malaysia. This gentleman was brilliant at his job, very polite, started a conversation with me since i was alone, overall he stood out the most with improving my experience. Its been about an hour, i am ordering a few more drinks and taking in the scenery which is spectacular. I have stayed at various 5 and 7 Star hotels around the world as my job requires travelling not mention working at several Top end Restaurants and Hotels in Toronto. I put on my academic hat and noticed the following: Cling wrap still attached to where the wine glasses are kept, A bartender who cut mini ice blocks, dropped one block in the sink and then put it into a drink he was preparing for a customer (Lucky not mine), Uncleared glasses (Used), Tables left uncleared (Staff walking past it and not clearing),Arrogant staff except for a select 3, You have to ask if you want something although the restaurant has an abundance of staff compared to seating capacity (Quite genius if you look at it from a marketing prospective), Slow service. Time for the bill, Drinks are pretty reasonable for the caliber of venue (Have spent more at less established venues). Overall, Spago (Lounge) has a classy ambiance but lacks professionalism due to staff.. The hostess's (except for 2 hostess's) had a valley kinda persona and lack courtesy (Don't smile or acknowledge patrons). In my opinion which is based on professional experiences (Ritz-Carlton, The Plaza (NYC) Burj Al Arab etc), The Staff in general need further training when it comes to PR and restaurant operations (Attention to Detail). In all, its worth the visit.
4
Great ambience with good music and fantastic views. Have not been to Gardens by the Bay so it was an additional treat to get the birds eye view from Spago. Had a nice long lunch with a friend despite the heat as the lounge doesn't have air-conditioning, we enjoyed ourselves. We cooled off with some proseco and of course the yummy fare. Had the tuna tartare - their specialty. Two orders of that! It was spicy, fresh, good seasoning on the tuna and the black sesame cones were sweet. Great flavours and texture. Also tried the Pork Belly Sandwich which was really good too. The surprising crunch from pork belly and sticky sweet sauce with avocado and cilantro was superb
5
Most fine dining establishments in Singapore suffer from 2 problems - food that is beautiful but not tasty, and service that doesn't meet the mark. In that respect, Spago really stands out with food that is beautifully presented and very tasty. Service is accommodating, thoughtful and classy. We were 10 people having dinner, Spago did well to accommodate our dietary requirements (we had 1 muslim guest) and offered recommendations and was willing to switch one of the entrees with a vegetarian option. They made recommendations for our order to ensure we didn't over order and enjoyed a good selection of entrees, mains and desserts. This to me is a mark of great service and something many fine dining establishments in Singapore should learn from. Some highlights that we really enjoyed - the veal ragout and foie gras kaya toast were delicious. grilled lamb chops (very fresh and not gamey), steak and cod were all very tasty. Dessert's must orders would be the famous salted caramel souffle and the chocolate espresso semifreddo (this made all of our eyes light up). An unforgettable meal and experience enhanced by a beautiful ambience and thoughtful team. :
5
If you're visiting Singapore, make sure Spago's on your list of places to stop. The view over the infinity pool looking out over the city is amazing. We had fantastic service and were looked after by the manager. Be prepared to pay a little more than average for food and drink, but the service and views are definitely worth it. We spent an entire Sunday afternoon lounging in the shade, admiring the views. I would definitely recommend sticking around for a glass of bubbles on sunset. :
5
Spago is a great place for chilled out sundowners! Beautifully decorated it has a stunning view of the cityscape as well as the sea. The cocktails, while on the pricey side are really yummy. If you want to be cost effective getting a bottle is a better option especially if you are in a bigger group. The food is wonderful. I would recommend the sliders and the spring rolls. The service has always been attentive and friendly. The staff really do go out of their way to make sure you have a great experience. I highly recommend it for celebrations or if you want to get a great view of the Singapore skyline
5
Spago on top of Marina Bay Sands is a wonderful experience and not to be missed when you are in Singapore. The Black Cod miso was deliciously served with a bundle of noodles flavoured with orange and coriander noodles. Friendly and professional staff made the evening unforgettable. Thank you
5
I was here for dinner and the food was absolutely stunning. I ordered the tuna tartare starter and not only was it beautifully presented it was delicious. The sea bass in laksa sauce was out of this world. The wine list is fab, service attentive, view stunning. All in all, a must visi
5
The staff are brilliant, the food amazing, the veal tartar was incredible.
such a great meal.
Only thing is toward the end of the night, the staff kind of forgot about us as the only people outside...
5
Went to Spago on 19/05/2016 for my birthday.A big shoutout to Captain Catalin, who made our night special! He provides great recommendations on the food, and the food were very nice! His service was fantastic too, taking care of us & very humorous.Must try - duck breast, tuna tartare cones, kaya toast, hamachi & warm octopus salad. Their dessert is not so fantastic, a little too sweet for me. Especially the caramel.
5
Have now celebrated two birthdays at Spago and will return. The fish items, the Pan Seared Red Snapper Laksa and Honey Miso Broiled Black Cod were standouts. Also not to be missed, is their signature dish, the Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones - a taste sensation.Loved the atmosphere - well spaced large tables, bright and breezy interior and well trained and friendly staff. Great cocktails at the bar and well worth a visit prior to dinner
4
Such a great lounge, such a beautiful chilled out and high end vibe, and so much better than it's neighbour Ce La Vie. Shame only about the service, which is quite sad. It was impossible to get a waiter to look at us even to get a glass of water. Eventually we had to get up and ask at the bar ourselves
5
I don’t write many reviews, in fact this is my second ever… but I just wanted to take the time to do so as Michael and his team did an exceptional job at turning around what was an unfortunate booking error.We had a reservation for 2:30 on Mother’s Day so we arrived looking forward to a long leisurely afternoon dining experience. Unfortunately there had been an error and we were informed that the restaurant was closing and we would therefore not be able to have lunch (although we had the option of dining in the more relaxed area outside – but this doesn’t have aircon and is not what we had in mind in any case). Unfortunately the front desk (not sure if this is part of Spargo or a shared service with the hotel) were rather inflexible and the attitude was unfortunately that this was our fault.At any rate, a small amount of escalation later to the right level of management not only we were given a number of complementary dishes / drinks (all of which are covered here in other reviews and are indeed delicious) but we were also allowed into the (now closed) restaurant to continue our meal. I must say the complementary dishes & drinks were much appreciated – who doesn’t like that – but what most impressed me was the level of service that Michael and the team gave to us during the whole experience. I can safely say that this is cemented in my memory as one of the best, if not the best dining experience I have had in Singapore. Thanks to Spago – we will be back... and your restaurant is also now number 1 on my client entertainment list

We had a late dinner without advance reservation but managed to get a table - luckily! The restaurant was a nice surprise as we didn't had read anything about this restaurant beforehand. The food was tasty and I ate the best chocolate dessert ever!!! It was perfect with chocolate, coffee, hints of salt etc. And that is a lot to say as I have eaten quite many chocolate desserts during my life :
5
what a great place for a restaurant. stayed in the tower 3 and went there for breakfast. What an amazing place with lovely service and great food
5
Good food, friendly service, nice ambience with a great view of Singapore. Dessert was excellent. Rather pricey but that's the cost of living in this city.
5
This would have to be one of the top 5 restaurants in Singapore. The food is absolutely divine with great flavours. Western food with a slight local influence. Expensive but worth the money
5
An attractive new enterant into the bar/lounge scene in Singapore. Scores with its amazing location , perched on top of Marina Bay Sands. The views are tuning day or night. My preference would be to begin with sun down cocktails and party into he night.... As the sun sets. Great choice of cocktails and eats. The spicy tuna in waffle cones is interesting as are the beef sliders. It's a lovely area that looks into the famous infinity pool . One only wishes we did not have to stare at the never ending stream of hotel guests in their bathrobes and slippers while we corn our party best!!
5
Enjoying Singapore in a posh way.
A good place to chill with good friends, good atmosphere. Impeccable.
5
One of the best views of Singapore.
Staff is incredibly on the ball.
Head Bartender is superb.
Some great cocktails are made in this venue.
Food is top end.
A def must visit while in Singapore.

One of THE new places to eat in Singapore. Casual elegant with impeccable service and light modern cuisine. Both fish dishes we ordered were perfectly cooked. The tuna appetizer was the tastiest dish. Excellent wine list. Caramel soufflé is the must dessert choice. Book well ahead as its popula

Two nights ago, my wife and I celebrated her birthday at Marina Bay Sands Spago restaurant. We were welcomed warmly and with entering the restaurant we left Singapore and arrived in another world. We chose the tasting menu and enjoyed a relaxed, almost three hour long journey with different tastes of food and wine. Chef Greg presented most of the courses in person and explained many intersting things to us. We loved the food, and in addition, the very kind presentation.Host and Sommelier Michael selected the wine pairing with european wines, but, as I asked for (we are coming from Germany), he was happy to present a californian selection, which I really enjoyed! Michael and Greg, accompanied by a dedicated team, made this evening a very special one for my wife and me. They did an outstanding job, and walked „the special mile“ many timest hat night.We spent a wonderful night at Spagos and will be happy to visit again during our next stay in Singapore
5
Second time at Spago and this time was even better than the first. Despite the fact that we had only been able to book a table for 6pm and our guests were very late, our server reassured us that there was no need to rush and made everyone very relaxed. Service was exceptional throughout the evening, with both the Chef and one of the managing partners coming to the table to speak with us. This level of service is one of the things that separates Spago from a lot of other restaurants in Singapore. The other thing is the food, crab risotto was the best risotto that I have ever had which I have seen echoed in a few other reviews. All the other dishes were equally superb. Combined with a great wine and cocktail list, plus the amazing setting, all in all a superb evening. Definitely one of my top restaurants in Singapore, and one I will return to in the near future
4
A laid back country feel on the top of the marina bay sands. Food was decent, we had the club sandwich, burger, tuna tartar and the tagliatelle. All expertly put together, nothing too fancy or innovative. The hostess seemed a bit uncomfortable in her platform stilettos which we felt was a bit of a strange look for the place. Otherwise service is very good and we recommend the cocktails.

With some of the best views in Singapore and a lovely outside bar (including a smoking section) this has to be one of the places to enjoy dinner in this cosmopolitan city.Ok, its not cheap with mains coming in at around $100 Singapore, but the food quality was exceptional and everything we had tasted fresh and really good.Standout food included the Spago Tuna cones, a veal tartare, the angry lobster and the veal chops.Oddities included a discussion about the lamb, which came from Colorado and not New Zealand, and the waiter making a mistake about which of the 5 starters we ordered was the one to share. Our waiter also left before we did, shift ended?, which was rather odd.After our lovely dinner we moved outside and had a nightcap, and although we were the last guests we were left in peace with no hurry to leave.We would certaining return for a future visit.Well done Mr Puck

Although pricy this restaurant was definitely worth it. Our waiter was nothing but friendly and was incredibly prompt when we needed anything and kept the wine glasses topped up sufficiently. I had the duck as a main course which was cooked to perfection. Then on the waiters recommendations we shared the salted caramel creme brûlée and it didn't disappoint. It was delicious! If you want a treat I would definitely recommend Spago.

Food American fusion restaurant. Liked the western food but not the Japanese fusion. Menu had sashimi from tokyo's tsujiki market but I don't like it when Asian food is fusion-ed.But the western items like the veal and steak and risotto were delicious.Ambience Nice and cost despite being a fancy place Beautiful views of the city Location Generally I don't like going to marina bay sands because it's such a big complex and to get from the carpark to restaurant is such a hassle.

During our 4 night stay in Singapore at MBS, we ate a Spago which is a colonial contrast to the shiny modernism of the rest of the hotel. Located on the 57th floor and accessed by reservation only it has a very special feel. The food and service was Michelin star quality, in fact the service out shone many of the Michelin star restaurants that I have visited. I accidentally spilt sauce on my dress and within seconds the waiters had noticed and brought a bowl of soda water and a cloth to wipe it clean without any prompting. Special mention to Arash and Yamin who delivered exceptional service and advice throughout our meal. They were friendly, chatty but not too intrusive and very professional...they could teach some of the high end restaurants a thing or two about great servic

A great place for a lovely evening, on the level of the infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands, Offering some of the best views in town.
5
Whilst we didn't pay to go up to the skypark $23, we had full buffet breakfast at spago at the top of the second tower at $44. Great deal!! Plus the views. Great selection of food which was really fresh You can also go up to the top of tower 1 for free as there is a small viewing area for a happy snap.
5
Appetizers were good - Tuna tartare cones were phenomenal, pity they were really small. The agnolotti was really well done. The 'kaya toast' was definitely unique, interesting flavour combination.Mains - Loup de mer was easily the best dish of the night, the fish was cooked perfectly. Duck breast was also enjoyable, but veal chops, which was the most expensive dish, also turned out to be the most disappointing, as the meat was overcooked.Desserts - salted caramel souffle was delicious, paired nicely with the apple sorbet. Chocolate semifreddo was well-liked by everyone.Service was good. Server's recommendations were all very good aside from the veal. Ambience was nice, but couldn't really enjoy the view from where we were seated
5
Spago was some of the best food I have had since moving to Singapore. It has city vistas on one side of the restaurant and sea views on the other. Spago's has great cocktails, but the food blew us away. It was great. So many times we have gone to "good" restaurants only to be let down with a large bill at the end...but Spago was excellent! And try the Salted Caramel souffle for dessert. I'm not a dessert person, but even I couldn't get enough
5
Dinner for 2 in March - excellent service, atmosphere and food. A few items were brought out within minutes of ordering, suggesting they were pre-made, which is not ideal but otherwise everything was perfect. Highly recommend.
5
Went along with friends for a special birthday dinner. They had preordered a smaller menu - always wise with 10 to choose - have to say we were really impressed, every course was delicious! Some unusual combinations - Foie Gras with Kaya Toast? Scallops with tiny edible flowers? It was a real adventure in food and amazing flavours served beautifully. Add in cool music (retro playlist that we loved!) and attentive, professional service from knowledgeable staff add in drinks beforehand with stunning views and it all made for a perfect evening - can't wait for the next special occassion to return - definitely an excellent choice for a memorable evening
5
Executive summaryPros - Fantastic location providing best view of Singapore, decent service, sufficient range of drinks, proximity to the infinity pool, well priced for an iconic bar.Cons - Can be crowdedOverall a great experience. Weather was perfect the day we went, so that helped.Top tip - Get a table facing infinity pool for best vie
5
Went here for lunch with my wife, late March, and the food and service was great. We ordered the set lunch and was mostly surprised by the size of the dishes (huge) as we did expect the food to be as good as it was. We left completely stuffed which is not common when you order a set lunch. The only drawback is the price of the wines by the glass as they are quite steep for the type of wine you are served. My Wife had also mentioned that it was my birthday and upon realising that I did not eat a dessert (had changed to cheese without any problems) I was offered a complimentary espresso martini instead which I felt was a nice touch and showed the attentiveness of the great people serving us.Will definitely be back again soo
4
I had dinner at Spago with a group of friends: we first had drinks at the lounge and then dinner inside. The food was delicious, the portions abundant, the wine very good and the service staff extremely competent and friendly. Last but not least: the view from the top of the Marina Bay Sands is always great!
5
On my recent trip to Singapore,I was staying at the Marina Bay Sands and someone suggested to try out this restaurant on the rooftop. I must admit,it was something really special. I've dined at some of the finest restaurants in my travels over the years,and this is certainly up there with the very best. I especially enjoyed my morning breakfasts there on a daily basis. The breakfast staff are nothing short of amazing. They are super professional,and their attentiveness to your needs is quiet remarkable. Special thanks must go to Agata,Paul, & Raj who are all members of the breakfast team, for being so professional,punctual and attentive. Honestly,I would not hesitate for one minute to recommend this place to any who enjoy the finer things in life
5
Went for a birthday dinner more or less straight off the plane from Uk. The view is absolutely breathtaking - as was the food and the service.
3
My galfrd chose this restaurant to celebrate her birthday lunch. Prior when making reservation (both online and when called for confirmation) had already requested for a birthday special dessert or cake for her which most restaurants do have.Food is average. After our meal, went to remind them of my request and the servic crew looked blur. I would have expected the request to be keyed into the system or something like that. After waiting a while, while the birthday gal went to the ladies, I asked another server and he was mentioning that if we ordered their dessert platter or dont know what. In the end i just repeated and said I had already requested for birthday dessert platter. Shortly was served but without her personalised name which means my prior request was ignored.Disappointing service and was also charged $24++ for some dessert sorbet as the birthday platter. There was even a floss (string) which one of other girlfriend pulled out from the bread that was served before our food.Will not go back for sure

Spago near the pool at the Sands Bay Marina was unfortunately a very predictable restaurant. The restaurant could pretty much serve anything and people would show up because of the extraordinary location at the top of the hotel looking over the very famous infinity pool on one side and the Gardens by the Bay on the other side. The menu had tuna tartare, sliders, steak, mashed potatoes, sushi, sashimi. Everything was good only not very unique in my opinion (except for the mashed potatoes with some kind of cheese that were absolutely inedible). A lot of finger food given the loungy atmosphere of the restaurant. As would be expected for such a popular place, the restaurant is a bit of a scene. Go for the location, have a drink at the bar, stay for dinner if it suits you fancy but remember you are there for location, location, location and if you are looking for a great meal in a city with so much great food, I would opt for another location
4
My husband and I made reservations 2 days before our lunch to ensure that we would get a table. Fast forward to the day of our lunch and we were greeted by not so friendly staff upon arrival. I'm not too sure if it was because of the heat or because we were 10 mins late. In any case, it took them a little more than 5 mins before we were shown to our table. I'd like to add that it seemed like they didn't have my reservation as the two ladies looked equally puzzled when my husband gave them his name.The service in the fine dining area was a world of difference. Friendly, observant, attentive staff who were not intrusive at all. Special thanks to Catalin who recommended us a menu which suited us perfectly and made our lunch so much more enjoyable with space to treat ourselves to a huge serving of soufflé
2
The bar lounge is OK, drinks were nice and service was very quick and capable. But the restaurant was very poor. Cold and arrogant staff, slow and resentful service and then food that is well below both the standard of the brand and the price point. The view is also unattractive - the casino pool or container shipping on the other side? Cannot recommend anyone to visit. It's just just well below a decent standard
4
A fabulous burger with an extraordinary view. Ordered a burger for lunch at spa go bar on the rooftop bar at a marina bay sands. The burger arrived as ordered - meat cooked medium- with a generous serving of decadent fries. Excellent Attentive service with a panoramic view of Singapore marin
2
Great location although no view at the restaurant. Insanely cold from the AC...and even though we covered up we still could not enjoy our night and had to rush through dinner in 30 minutes because of the too cold temperature. The waitor even though he was polite you could tell it was fake which did not show well for such a place. However no recommendations made from him. Food was tasty but definitely not worth the prices. I understand that prices are high because of location, taxation and rent at the hotel but cannot be almost 3 times more expensive than Spago in Beverly Hills with a similar situation. No comparison with atmosphere, staff and quality of food with the one in Beverly Hills. Much below expectations, unfortunately. Better to have a drink at the lounge with a nice crowd than dinner with no value for money.
5
As we had hoped for, Spago was perfect. The food, views and service were all outstanding. While it can be said the view from the actual restaurant is somewhat obscured, it is still great. And you can always step over to the lounge for better views. We have 5 different meals at our table and all were outstanding. The black cod and the veal chops were outstanding. But save room for the large desserts - we had the semi freddo and a soufflé - both outstanding and enough for all 5 of us to share
1
Reached here by 6pm. Sit inside by 6.10pm, ordered by 6.20pm. Finished meal by 7pm. All I can say is WOW. The hostess was friendly, staffs were attentive -at first. As when he took the order, he asked: do you want us to serve it slowly or do you have plans to go after this? Answer was: slow would be great, we have no plan.But, the food came extremely fast which made us think that we were being rushed and push to leave as soon as we finish our meal.I ordered squid ink pasta. As I wanted to let my friend to taste it, the server divided it into two plates. However, he held the spoon and fork unprofessionally which caused the pasta dropped *luckily in the serving plates*, with stain on my table and my white tops + skirt. WOW again. Applause to you. He just said sorry but never come back to clean the mess.What i expected from fine dining restaurant is:1. Service.2. Food.Most important is the service. I felt so lucky not to choose Spago on celebrating my birthday as I think it will ruin my day. DEFINITELY WILL NOT COME BACK N WONT RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO GO HERE. WASTING MONEY FOR A TERRIBLE SERVICE AND YOU NEED TO PAY FOR SERVICE CHARGE. Who will pay for my laundry then
5
We rounded our holiday off with dinner at Spago. Spectacular setting on the 57th floor of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. It's expensive but was definitely worth it over $500 for 2. We didn't have a starter but the bread they served is homemade and delicious. For main I opted for the snapper accompanied with a beautiful red Thai curry sauce and beautifully presented and very tasty. This was accompanied with roast and pureed cauliflower which is a fantastic and very tasty way to cook cauliflower. My husband had the veal and equally delicious. For dessert I chose the salted caramel soufflé it was amazing but massive! Wasn't expecting it to be that big but God it was delicious ! And highly recommended. My husband had a chocolate dessert but secretly I think he had dessert envy! It was a great way to end a fabulous 3 week holiday.
4
Located at 57th floor with city & garden veiw, Outdoor feeling, nice dishes, freindly services, becide MBS pool.
I sujest you to go this restaurant at night because the temperature is lower and garden veiw is dreami
5
Such a view in such a nice place with really nice team ! Btwn two fltghts, during transfer, we had the opportunity to have three crazy hours in Sopago terrace !!! DO IT !!!
3
Setting is nice obviously, but the wind was just a mood killer. Food was nice, cocktails were good and service was great. Will I return? Nah. Had the food been as good as the service we'd definitely return but it fell just a bit short.
5
Dined with my husband on the 22nd March 2016. We wanted to have good food at a prestigious place so we ended up here. The food: Very fresh and we could tell that they were made with meticulous detail and love. We ordered quite a few things i.e. Squid Ink Tagliatelle Pasta, Pan Seared Red Snapper ‘Laksa’, Roasted Brussels Sprouts and 2 more items which I didn't remember what they were as it was my husband's choice. All of what we ordered were delicious and we had a wonderful dinner in the restaurant. Finished off dinner with the Earl Grey Tea Mousse with a teapot of Sencha. The staff were very attentive and service oriented. Pricewise : Pricey but overall worth every SGD spent! Will come back soon

I have visited this restaurant twice now and on both occasions I was impressed and enjoyed the meal and experience. The restaurant is up on the 57th Floor of MBS so you're there in a jiffy given how fast the lift is. Staff then show you to your table in what is a surprisingly large restaurant with one USP being that you walk past people swimming in the hotel's Infinity pool. Once you're seated in the restaurant you realize how clever the construct and décor are: you don't really see the hotel residents any more. Instead you have a tranquil view of Singapore on both sides and at the other you have a view of palm trees. The restaurant is light and airy - overall a very Californian feel. Chic but relaxing.I was quite impressed by the food as well. I had a set lunch one day and was gobsmacked by the portions. The pasta as a starter is more than enough for one and the chicken that I ordered comprised four generous pieces. There was no way that I could finish it and the staff weren't at all sniffy as they offered me to put the leftovers in the doggie bag - an offer I happily took up. By the way, they added that plenty of people get through not only a two-course meal but a four-course meal. In any case, $55 for a two-course meal of this quality was reasonable I felt.If I have any criticism, I think the front staff who guide you to your table could be a little friendlier. On both instances that I visited they were icy cold. Perhaps it's a language issue - but that's in stark contrast to the staff inside the restaurant who could not be more friendly and obliging
4
Went there for a business lunch Amazing views. We ordered a selection of starters including the tuna cones, spicy hamachi and the potstickers. The tuna cones were excellent and highly recommended. The potstickers were doughy and would not order. The main courses were taking time so they offered us ravioli in butter sauce, which was rich and delicious. The main courses were also good - the cod was excellent. Food, location and service attitude was excellent. However they really need to improve their speed of delivery especially on a weekday lunch.
3
The drinks are overpriced and the souffle was tasteless. The drinks were tasty but the souffle was overpriced. See the trend?Spago is your typical overpriced singaporean establishment which has amazing views, a tremendous ambiance, but falls short in the food and the drinks category. I would go back for a fun night about town but i would go with a date as the male clientele there can be pretty raunchy
5
Spago was the venue we selected to celebrate our 17th anniversary and were totally impressed. Few would be surprised at the amazing view from teh 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands, and if you are familiar with the name and all that stands behind it you would no doubt also agree that fine dining barely describes it accurately. The service, from setting the reservations, to welcoming us on arrival to every server, hostess, waiter you name it that was involved was in fact impeccable. My compliments to all who made it such a memorable evening and highly recommend it as a venue of choice
5
Have been to Spago's quite a few times for both dinner and drinks and it has never disappointed. The lounge has proven to be "the" in place for a cocktail and before dinner or heading out elsewhere. Fantastic ambiance and filled with the beautiful people in town. Great view but may sting the wallet a little. The restaurant is absolutely amazing with one of the best service I have ever had. The food is excellent as expected and fomenting not to be missed is the lobster. They also have a fantastic selection of whiskey's and wine. Don't miss the deserts! Only let down is that the toilet is on another floor....but other than that, it ranks as one of the top on my list to host a business dinner or for that special anniversary with your love one
2
I had the displeasure of going to spago for dinner tonight the furniture blocked the stunning view. Seems like no thought was given to encorporating the view while desigining the restaurant. I ordered the sirloin steak rare. What I was served looked like a fillet steak sliced in 7 slices. Neither was the fat layer there nor the flavour of a sirloin. I questioned it but the manager insisted it was a sirloin with all the fat trimmed" who does that" overall a mediocre experience. The meat was on the chewy side and the potatoe gratin was dry. I should have taken a picture. Definately will not come back
4
I went here with a few friends for dinner. The food was delicious, i definitely recommend the veal. The view is breath taking. But be prepared for a sizable bill!!
5
I was dubious, mostly because I often find brands from celebrity chefs to be formulaic and devoid of personality however unlike many of his contemporary Wolfgang Puck has captured the feel of LA in this window on the wild restaurant at the top of the marina bay sands. Our evening was chic and the menu expected well. We weren't expecting to have enjoyed it as much as we did so hats off to the chefs keeping the brand to its loft heights. Our food was sublime. Beetroot starter was exceptional. The right balance of sweet and sour, seasoned well and delicious, creamy feta to balance out the sweetness. Risotto was just al dente enough and packed with flavour. Black cod miso was exceptional with sweet from the honey and spice from chillies. Could have taken more heat though for me. Our waiter was a colourful chap who was as enthused to be at Spago as we were and filled us in on a lot of the history of the hotel and the Spago brand. Worth a trip to this restaurant as the view and the food combine to make it a true destination worthy venue.
2
First, the view is blocked by furniture, service counters, etc, and the seats are mostly in the centre...do even if on the 57th floor, it is definitely not the best view in town.Second, the food. Quite average by Puck standards, if you ask me. Spending a couple of thousand bucks you would expect to have something really awesome to remember the menu by. But this is not in that league. If you want to spend this kind of money and not disappoint a date or a colleague, take them to Cut or Morton's without risking things here. Spago is definitely not quite there yet !Will not recommend a second visit 
4
I was invited for lunch at Spago.I really appreciated the service's quality from the moment we arrived. The atmosphere was pretty cosy.The waiters were professional but very friendly too.We had some really good food & the wine was simply delicious! It's too bad we didn't have a better view but no big deal after all.I would DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant
4
Enjoyed a business dinner for five. Arrived without a reservation but managed to seat us within 30 minutes, it was Sunday evening and would not expect to be able to do that on a Friday or Saturday.Menu is not extensive which is a good sign as that is typical of high end restaurants, quality makes up for quantity.Highly recommend the sushi appetizer, more than enough to share, other guests chose the foie gras also said to be outstanding.Our main dishes included the grilled black bass, cod and prime steak all of which we enjoyed.Wine list is extensive, from S$100.00 per bottle to a staggering 11'500.00.With the Sommeliers assistance we found the perfect wine combination at reasonable prices.All in all a good evening and we will definitely be returning
5
We took the opportunity to head to the top of MBS and combine it with an evening cocktail or three! We really enjoyed the service, the view and the beautiful drinks. The ambience is good and the amount of actual drink in the cocktails (rather than ice) was pleasantly surprising. We were not able to leave the bar area and explore the whole deck, though we were able to take photos of the famous pool and the Gardens by the Bay at dusk.Well worth a visit and for the three of us, we spent around AUD100 for a nice snack and about 6 drinks. Great value for the overall experience
5
The restaurant serves good food and a fine choice of wine . Service was good though not perfect. We were 4 diners. Two had fish one had lamb and one had beef. all dished and side were well prepared and well presented. This is a good, not great, restaurant. We enjoyed the meal and recommend it as such
4
Food was great. Had the cod which I really enjoyed. Ok for business and special occasions but a little expensive for regular dining in my view. The salmon my client had looked great as well. Excellent views and the staff were attentive and helpful. not an easy place to find though as you have to change lifts and know which direction to go
2
The bar and lounge is busy. They do not seem to have a proper system for table management and the hostess brought us about for 5mins through the whole restaurant before finding an unoccupied table.The drinks aren't strong, they look beautiful but are generally a little diluted. Drinks with egg whites tend to be rather eggy and seem to have egg thrown in to their just to get a small head of foam.We had sliders and a soufflé, the soufflé was airy and light, but lacked the complexity that the chocolate soufflé at their sister restaurant had (cut by Wolfgang)Service was rushed and a lol haphazard, food and drink were generally below average, but the Setting is wonderful 
5
This review is based on the Spago Lounge, not restaurant. Spago is one of my new favorite destinations for a nice cocktail and some snacks. Located on the rooftop of MBS is also a plus. The spicy tuna tartare and pork wontons are fantastic. The service at Spago, as with most places in MBS, is top notch. The atmosphere is not stuffy as one might expect, but is really relaxed. They did a great job creating the environment to be relaxing. Coupled with a great cocktail menu and snacks, it is a great place to go for a relaxed evening or before dinner drinks
4
few beers and a couple of burgers were S$160+, but the view and location make it worth it. The views at sunset are terrific, and you can sit 'out side', which for a northern European in winter that is pretty good
5
Went there for breakfast and just fall in love with the place! So lovely, the vibe, the ambience. Staffs were very attentive and friendly. Awesome interior work too! My fav dining place in Singapore by far!
4
Lo stesso at the 57th Floor offer a stunning view.
Food was very fresh, the salads stunning.
Service definitely very good, and professional, actually one of the best of Singapore.
Highly recommended.
5
The restaurant is at the top of the Marina Bay Sands and well worth the visit. We had a view of the city and the harbor and the food was excellent. Our waiters were attentive and gracious and although it is a little pricey, it is worth it
4
We managed to get an outside table at sunset without a booking! Internally they were fully booked. The food is absolutely superb and the views are exactly what you would expect from the 57th floor.However the service leaves a lot to be desired. Although polite, friendly and courteous, it was inattentive. Nobody came to ask our how food was and we had to wait, and wait, and wait for the bill to arrive.Finally, we had to ask someone to come to take our money. Not exactly what you would expect from a five star restaurant but I would still recommend the experience!
2
The hostess greeter was fine, and took the time to show us round so we could select where to sit.Which we did for 20 minutes, and no server bother coming over. When I approached the bar, the barman was very unfriendly and left it to a female server to give us menus. Distinct impression from this guy he was far too self-important to serve us.Having given us menus another 10 minutes elapsed with no one attending to us. Despite serving the table right next to us. So we left and went to Cé La Vi in Tower 3 instead - where we had a great tim
4
A great evening. I had veal ragout gnocchi as appetizer (32++) and USDA Prime black angus as a main (92++). My wife had the seafood risotto as appetizer (42++) and as main the laksa fish (one of the cheapest mains at 58++). Everything we ate was good to very good. The wines were a little bit of a disappointment (SitziusKabinettG riesling and Koonunga shiraz) but that is not a big issue of course. You can also have a set menu at 225++ and another 150++ if you want wines to go with that. So definitely not cheap at all. The ambiance is great but if you look out the window you see all the hotel guests in bathing suits and the like jumping in and out of the infinity pool which is just in front of the restaurant. That makes the view obviously very nice on top of MBS. The main negative point here is for sure the staff: in such a place with such a reputation and history, half of the staff are dragging their feet and making noises while doing that, quite typical in Singapore but not what you would expect in this kind of upmarket place. Some of the staff were also not very friendly, short and a bit rude in talking to you and one was maybe an intern or so (but without the intern badge you ususally see in these cases) because she was really not ready to talk to guests but still she did, having no idea of the menu and speaking with an enormously Singaporean accent not trying to make herself understood to us. Still all of this is minor as we were impressed with the quality of the food and the serving as well. That's why we decided to give 4/5 points. But still they should take note and do something about some of the people that work there.
5
This is a brilliant bar, on the 57th floor, with both sides open so you get a nice breeze which avoids you getting to hot.The bar staff is a great team, and we had a young lady making some cracking non alcoholic drinks for my wife while I went for some great wines.very good bar location, but again, the bar staff made each of our visits fun and rememorable
5
I think the lounge of the Spago on the 57th floor of tower 2 of the spectacular Marina Bay Sands is one of the most incredible places I've been too. After a lovely but rather overpriced and average dinner at the restaurant, we followed the wise advice of the manager, the lovely Laura and took out drinks to the lounge and bar area. If we knew better, we would have had finger food there. The atmosphere, design, music and most importantly the view are amazing. Great for chilling after hours especially on a school night when it's not crowded. One of my top 3 places
5
Everything we ate was exceptional. All the starters were delicious, and we loved the local influences (such as "Kaya" toast). The wine list is good and not too expensive compared to some other restaurants, although the food itself is pretty pricey. Definitely one for a special occasion, but worth it. Particularly recommend the Tuna Tartare cones, laksa, Kaya toast and sea food linguine
5
An amazing location from the top of the Marina Bay Sands. The food was top class fine cuisine and absolutely exquisite. The staff were perfect too. A fabulous evening.
5
Had one of the most enjoyable and delicious dinners. However, to me, there are too many ingredients in some of the dishes. But then, diners had a choice of which particular taste they want to experience. Maybe a good approach to food presentation.The service was excellent. The staff were knowledgeable and helpful. The worst experience was the way up to the restaurant where you meet all sorts of people in bathrobes and fluffy bedroom slippers. What a lousy entrance and exit to a wonderful experience in the restaurant
5
We had a wonderful evening with friends at the Spago. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious: tuna tartare cones, burrata, white truffle risotto, squid Ink tagliatelle pasta, honey miso broiled black cod and all the desserts. They also had a nice choice of wines. The service was very good. The location is beautiful and the view amazing
4
Been here couple of times and the food is good. Pasta dishes are really good and the main courses are big portions. Location of the restaurant is amazing as it is next to the infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands which overlooks the entire CBD area of Singapore. However service was severely poor during the second visit. My dad asked for a double whisky but the waiter only gave him a single shot. Then the waiter on our table for some reason, maybe he was in a bad mood, couldn't smile or greet us nicely when we sat down. Also he was pouring drinks like we were in a cheap bar cos he was spilling water as he was pouring into the glass. And he kept telling us to move cos he wanted to go around the table, instead of him moving to avoid telling us to move. Overall a good experience but i think Wolfgang himself needs to visit the location and whip the staff into providing better service to customers
4
A trip up to Marina Bay sands is mandatory for any traveller however be prepared to pay for it. I sat at the bar and had a lovely time with the bar tenders. They were great and very helpful. I did by an entry level champagne which started at $188. This was a bit of a shock but I guess to be expected when you have such a fantastic view. I recommend going here on a date with your significant other and sip champagne whilst gazing out at Singapore
4
Here for just one night, I came up for a lite snack and a drink or two. Sitting at the bar, the staff was very friendly and kept to all my wishes. I had the spicy tuna roll, and it was very good. Also, one Long Island ice tea, followed by a stoly martini. Nice atmosphere, good service. Thank you.
5
Came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. Nicely designed and airy looking. It was however almost empty which was strangeFor lunch, they have a 3 and 4 course and we opted for the latter. First course was a fusion laksa flavored spring roll with chili paid. I neither tasted the laksa nor the chili padi. 2nd course was a better agnolotti. My main of lobster Cobb was interesting - laid out flat on a plate and beautifully arranged in rows by ingredients . Dessert of citrus was very pretty with mandarin oranges that went through liquid nitrogen There's no amuse bouche nor petit fours, maybe they have it for dinner
4
It is a very breezy and cozy place despite the lack of space to walk. The spicy tuna and scallop roll sushi is really delicious! There are pool view seats and sea view seats as well. Look for Nayda, she is a very polite and friendly waitress all the way from Russia 
5
Firstly, start with the tuna tartare cones. And don't share them, you'll want more than one (or two). Prices are as expected at an MBS celebrity restaurant, but you don't need to go for the most expensive steak for an experience. The $86++ black Angus sirloin was delectable, and pair with the child fingerling potatoes for a complete meal. Finish it off with the salted caramel apple soufflÃ© and you won't care when you see the bill.

My husband & I recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at Spago situated by the infinity pool at the Marina Bay Sands in Singapore. We couldn't ask for a better location overlooking Singapore by night. The menu was quite extensive and we chose the baked salmon with vegetables. It was superbly cooked and quite satisfying. Our waiter was very attentive and our every request was met with a smile. Management surprised us with a complementary dessert and champagne for our anniversary. We were most appreciative and highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to celebrate an important event with style

High above on 57th floor at MBS the service is truly outstanding and the cuisines esp fish n charming birthday dessert make Spago memorable. Salt can be slightly reduced for the rice mushroom dish.

Just dropped in for drinks rather than dinner, would recommend here over Ce Le Vi, which is also on the top floor of Marina Bay Sands. Drinks not cheap but you're paying for the view. Bar staff were excellent. Thanks guys.

Like all expats in Singapore you eventually end up on the top floor of the Marina Bay Sands. In this case, I was invited by colleagues to enjoy the view - which is spectacular, but the food and the extensive bar menu will bring me back

Need to queue for breakfest, although empty tables are available w/o beong reserved. Coffe came late amd bit cold. They sittede with other guest to share the little table, and though we came in separately the bill was served for two.Breakfest buffet is ok but not amazing for the price tag of 50 SGD.However if you want to hv some food with a great city view it is worth it

We were there in Singapore for just 5 hours as transit to Bali and without giving the second thought, we went to Marina bay Sands roof top. We never heard about this restaurant before but after visiting there, i can never forget that experience at the top. Sitting besides the infinity pool with the full light show going on at the top was totally mesmerizing. The restaurant also serves some unique drinks which just acts as icing over the cake.

I would strongly suggest you keep your jackets with you at this restaurant. When asked if they had a cloak room the waiter said yes they do and they would hang mine and my colleague's jacket.When we asked for our jackets at the end of the evening the hostess rummaged in a drawer under a lap top to produce my colleague's jacket. Needless to say the jacket was crumpled and creased. Don't say you can hang a jacket and then stuff it in a drawer. Just let the patron know you can't hang it. Apart from the surly blonde waiter the food was good. The potato purée was delicious, as was the salted caramel soufflé.

Love it here. Spago opened up very recently atop Marina Bay Sands, overlooking the sweet infinity pool. This is Wolfgang Puck's marquee restaurant brand and I am beyond excited they opened it at this location in Singapore. I've been to the ones in LA (My mother's favorite), Las Vegas and Hawaii in the past and always very much enjoyed their great service and impeccable food. In addition to those three, they also have restaurants in Colorado and Istanbul which all have unique ingredients that make each Spago restaurant very different from each other. Spago Singapore is also innovative in its own way and you will see this immediately when receiving the menu to find "Kaya Toast", Pan Seared Alaska Halibut "Laksa", and Steamed Salmon "Hong Kong Style" on their menu.I've been to this restaurant once and their lounge on numerous occasions for date nights and friends gatherings and this place really can't be beat for a late night open-air lounge feel. After a few drinks, I had a momentary setback to thinking I was in LA or Miami.But let's start with restaurant side:You walk into a door that reminded me of The French Laundry in Napa and feel completely away from the MBS setting. Total class all around from the moment you sit down and are offered water. The food and service are outstanding. Spago calls itself a Californian cuisine restaurant (which I've always felt means the kind of food you would eat while kicking back and drinking wine) and we actually had a waiter from California serve our table which was pretty cool.My girlfriend and I ordered the following:1) Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones - This is Spago's staple starter across all of his restaurants. Every part of it is fresh, even the cones are handmade in the Spago kitchen. SO GOOD!2) Hand Cut Agnolotti with White Truffle - So good we got two orders of it. Fresh agnolotti pasta with a generous portion of white truffle. SO GOOD!3) I ordered the Grilled Sonoma Lamb Chops - These were incredible and perfect for the Insignia wine that we ordered. :)4) My girlfriend ordered the Honey Miso Broiled Japanese Black Cod which she loved as well.We unfortunately were too full for dessert but will opt for it next time around.I would highly recommend doing a dinner here for whatever occasion, solid food that you can expect great quality from.For the lounge:I've been here many times now and love every bit of it. This is the first lounge in Singapore that I feel operates the way a lounge should - great wine and drinks, great bar snacks/food, great music, great service in a very comfortable and airy environment. It is run very efficiently and they hire good people to take great care of you. Come here for even one beer and you'll see that you can just let your hair down and enjoy yourself, something I find a rarity in with Singapore drinking culture. It truly feels like they brought in an LA or Miami type classy casual spot into Singapore and totally nailed it.They have the Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones here so make sure to get those while sipping one of their delicious cocktails. The sliders and langoustine are very good. The California Roll uses real crab and is very delicious despite a more expensive price tag. And for the sweet tooths out there, they serve a really good Halo Halo dessert.THEY ARE OPEN LATE AFTER MIDNIGHT TOO!Totally check this place out. Very highly recommend for a solid date night cocktail or a casual hangout with friends.Also, one of the previous TA members wrote a great review but mentioned that you can get better food for the price at a place like Osteria Mozza inside Marina Bay Sands. Please be aware that everything is subjective and Osteria Mozza is strictly Italian cuisine while Spago is a blend of all different types of nationalities with a "Californian" feel. Comparing the two is like comparing two separate cuisines. If you are in the mood for your more traditional Italian pasta or Italian prepared meat courses, then that's what Osteria Mozza is for. But if I were given the choice of the two restaurants for the price and experience, it would be a no-brainer and I would choose Spago everytime

It does not matter whether you are a guest of the hotel, if you are around Marina Sands bay in Singapore and you want to have a drink, this bar is exactly where you need. The view is awesome and the staff is great. Food is not expansive at all. I had a couple of beers before leaving this magnificent terrace at the 57th floor. Open after 12am, it requires dress code after 6pm. It is a good spot to take some amazing shots as you can't access the swimming pool if you are not a guest of the hotel

The service just doesn't get any better than this. I was blown away with the quality of every single person who I interacted with there. I wasn't so impressed with the view given that it's right next to the pool and people were incessantly going back and forth noisily in towels, taking selfies and obstructing an otherwise descent view of the fabulous skyline. This seriously diminished the romantic possibilities of the restaurant's interior charm. The restaurant's booths looked cozy however we were seated next to another couple at a stand-alone table, quite closely, even though the place was empty at 6 pm. I'd give the view 3 out of 5 stars. The food was mostly better than average but the prices were pretty darn high. The sole was pretty good and the veal gnocchi was good enough. Hats off to the staff however for a tremendous effort.

I was here for dinner with my partner and to celebrate his birthday, though we didn't inform the restaurant. We have been to a few Wolfgang Puck restaurants in US before. Other then famous among Hollywood celebrities, he is not really that famous - for his food. And it was no exception this time round.The restaurant is at 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands. One have to take the Tower 2 elevators to 55th floor and change to another one to get to it. A little inconvenient to get to. Good thing they also have a reception on 1st floor to advise guest how to get to it.Restaurant setting is pleasant, kind of European style and not too cramp. we were seated at the side that facing Gardens by The Bay, though view is kind of obstructed by planters outside the restaurant.For my friend birthday celebration, we ordered 2 Glass of French 2010 Chateau Thebaud White recommended by our waiter. We are not wine specialist but we thought it was fine. Our waiter didn't introduce himself though.We shared 4 dishes:- Burrata & Marinated Brussels S$29. It was nice but serving size is wanting.- 'Fruitti de Mare' Maine Lobster Risotto. S$72(Entree size). Nice but no exceptional.- Pan Seared Red Snapper 'Laksa' S$58. More like fried Snapper with nice crispy skin, and they got the right 'Laksa' taste! It was nice!- Dutch Milk-Fed Veal Chop S$88. Cooked medium as order. Good.2 Side Dishes. Both S$18. Serving size are good for sharing.- Dahl Cauliflower. OK.- Fingerling Potatos 'Patatas Bravas'. OK too. We think our waiter forgot our order, waited for quite sometime. We saw him entered it to the computer after we reminded him. Minus point here.S$400 plus, including our White Wine.For a fine dining restaurant, I consider Spago average (I am being nice!). Food not great, service mediocre. Our waiter missed one of our order, and we were basically neglected when a guests of a big table arrived. It also took quite sometime before we get our bill!After we clear our bill, my friend took a picture of their logo just outside the restaurant. One of their receptionist who happened to walk pass, asked us "Can I help YOU!" in a bit of a hostile tone, as if we are some gate crushers! I am quite sure we were dress to the occasion. So I told her my friend just want a picture with their famous logo, and we just finish our dinner at their restaurant. She realised her mistake, broke into Singlish "Sori, Sori, Sori!", and scoot off quickly. Well, I'm sorry too! It would have been nicer if she apologise and offer to show us around, like their lounge!I would not recommend this restaurant. For the kind of price, I am sure you could find better restaurant, even in Marina Bay Sands itself, like Osteria Mozza by Mario Batali

Pleasantly surprised. Great food but service could be better. Smallish portions but sufficient. I would have preferred if the staff had been more attentive.
5
We ate here whilst staying in the hotel and found everything just perfect from the food and staff to the view, it's prices are comparable to a good restaurant aunt in London but in our view worth it
5
If you need just food.. you could go everywhere. Perfect service, even the kitchen was ready to close, they presented us a perfect Entrecôte with a outstanding Aligot, even better than i get it in Paris before. Service was top, friendly..have visited Spago one time in Beverly Hills...so I thought, that there is big name, and if they are able to keep the promise for outstanding delicious menus. They could, even in the bistro.. well done.. coming back soon

I stay away from the MBS (Marina Bay Sands) complex becuase most of the restaurants are grossly overpiced and you leave feeling financially raped. But I was recently at Spago for dinner and I thought the value for money proposition was good. We sat at the bar area outside and they made the dining room menu available, which we wanted. Great ambiance, great food and the one thing that really stood out was the service, they try hard and they deliver. My waitress who ended up being one of the managers gave me her card at the end of dinner with her mobile, said next time I needed a table to phone her direct. Nice touch. If you want a nice dinner for either business or pleasure, you cant go wrong here
5
Attentive but not intrusive service, nice surroundings, meals served promptly.Quality meals, high end prices.High on the 57th floor there were good views of the harbour as well as the city skyline.We stayed for New Year's Eve fireworks - it was wonderful..The reception staff were so friendly
5
What a top spot with unbelievable views of Singapore It's on the 57th Floor and there's no charge for going there and the drinks are not too overpriced Compare to The Shard in London where it costs £25+ just to go up the liftDon't miss thi

Lovely hour spent for lunch at the top of the Marina Bay Sands. We both chose the burger with fries, washed down with glass of wine for her and a beer for me. Given the view on offer, the refined but relaxed atmosphere and the quality food provided, the pice of 130 Singapore dollars was money well spent. Would definitely recommend

As much as you would expect a great experience in such a growing restaurant. However, the first impression, wasn't just as pleasant. It was a bumpy ride, I would say! You have to check-in at hotel lobby and then head on to the restaurant. It may sound like a lot of hassle. The moment you arrive upstairs, the welcoming that I received downstairs just tickled away. I went up to the hostess stand, in which I was supposed to be welcomed at, however, the tall lady who was chatting in Russian to her colleagues treated me as if i was invisible! I was waiting for about 5 to 7 minutes, which is unacceptable. I was then accompanied to a table by one of the ladies in black. The ambiance in the dining room was unexceptionally good! Something that you should expect from a restaurant of this calibre. Food, wine, and what not in the restaurant was great! It is just sad that the way I was ignored is the first look of the restaurant that i had to receive! It would have been a 5-star experience if the welcoming could be as satisfying as the rest of what the restaurant could produce
5
This is the most fantastic place to eat, I cannot rate it highly enough. The service, food and location were just wonderful. Restaurants in lovely locations can be let down by service or food, this was not the case, staff were welcoming friendly and provided and excellent service and the food divine. I will certainly be making another visit
5
We decided to have a New Years day lunch at Spago. Whilst the menu initially looked short compared to the dinner menu, what we did finish up choosing was exceptional.The place has a great feel & the service was very good. The terrace bar looks great for drinks & food, but its dinner in the restaurant for me next time
4
Top notch service and great food. The food no one should miss is definitely the Spicy Tuna Taratare in Miso Cone: Absolut delight.
That said, please make sure you leave some space for the star: the gianduja chocolate dessert. It is a must.
5
We dined at Spago on Christmas Eve and it was our best venue choice. The service at the lounge bar and the restaurant was first rate and Michael, the F&B manager, made very good choice of wines which really complemented the occasion. Good venue, good company, good food, good wines and good service. Brilliant, Spago
5
I visit a lot of restaurants all over the world and even own a couple myself. I would say I eat out on average 3-4 nights a week. I have to say this is by far the best restaurant I've been to. The service, food, decor and view were top drawer. The starters we had though small in portion size were mouth watering. For the main meal we both chose the steak and it was cooked perfectly and was a large portion size. The vegetables were cooked well and the sauce was very well made. The wine selection was big enough to accommodate everyone.The deserts were stunning.However, The best part was the service. Being in the industry it's really challenging to get the right staff and they make all the difference. I understand this venue has only been open for a short while and so to get the team together they have is nothing short of incredible. Every one of them were excellent.Due to this and the quality of the food I must say that this is the best dining experience I've had. Well done guys the hard work has paid off. Brilliant. Maybe a touch pricey, but to get this type of standard it's worth paying for.

I'm so pleased that Spago has opened at next to the rooftop pool area of MBS. It's a much better use of space than what was there previously. We went with our kids to the bar lounge area. Love the ambience and comfy sofa chairs. The menu had enough variety and the service (altho patchy) was pleasant.We enjoyed the laksa spring rolls, the pork dumplings were not bad and the Korean pork BLT was something different.Cocktails were yummy and would love to have evening drinks here w friends sometime.
2
tried to make a booking at Spago to celebrate sent email to see availabilty. Received no reply which was a shame as we had enjoyed dinner at CE LA VI and thought we would try another restaurant Spagos loss would never try to book there agai

The other celebrity chef restaurants located on the bottom floors of the Marina Bay Sands are equally expensive, but without the view! We chose to dine outside and enjoyed people-watching all of the infinity pool goers take selfies. The view is absolutely breath-taking at night. The food was fantastic and we did not think that the portions were too small. One appetizer and one entree per person were more than enough for us. They also serve fresh bread and butter. I recommend the mushroom risotto- it was so creamy and loaded with fresh mushrooms, and not too salty. My husband enjoyed burrata appetizer immensely. We both ordered fish- red snapper for him and sea bass for myself. Both were cooked perfectly and were not dry. If you're considering a fine dining experience in Singapore, look no further. Just say "YES" to the new Spago! Excellent food, service, and food combine to create a fantastic experience.

Location is outstanding and feels very special.....although I was a bit envious of the hotel guests swimming in the pool outside!! Starters were excellent.....we had tuna tartare and foie gras. Mains were good solid meals but nothing really exceptional taste wise. We had steak for 2, chicken and salmon. The cauliflower and carrot sides however were unusually spicy and really delicious!! The Mille feuille desert was nice but also not outstanding.....I think Mary Berry would have said it was a little overdone!! The soufflé however looked amazing.....but we were so full we couldn't eat another thing!Wines by the glass were not a great choice but I don't like French wine.....as I informed the French Sommelier....oops!! The wine list is extensive and could be rather expensive if you wanted something very special. All in all I did think it was good value for money but maybe the exchange rate was working in our favour. £100 a head was pretty good for 3 courses in such an epic venue.Definitely worth a visit.
4
The place is beautiful and overlooks the Marina Bay in Singapore. The food taste - ok. I was not really blown by it. The portions are so small as well for the price. It is a good place to meet people and to socialize. If you are hungry, I would suggest going to another place instead
4
The menu is excellent - not too huge, but with excellent diversity. We (5 adults) selected 3 different dishes among our 5 starters. My wife's sashimi sashimi was a standout for flavour and presentation. My burrito was also superb. The squid ink tagliatelle had really intense flavour, but it was a very substantial starter.On to the mains - again, we selected 3 different dishes, and again my wife chose the winner. Her miso cod was a marvellous blend of flavours, all working together. I had the veal chop. It was excellent, but rather one-dimensional in flavour compared to the cod. Also, it was adorned with swipes of a demi-glace/balsamic reduction which for me did little to enhance the dish. My son's quail were delicious.And yes, do save room for the dessert! My son and I each had the salted caramel souffle. It was a marvel of lightness and flavour, consistent from top to bottom (as souffles should be, but often are not). The apple sorbet on the side provided an intense and palate-cleansing contrast. The other 3 had the mille-feuille - a dish for 2, but so generous that it satisfied 3. It too was excellent.The wine list is expensive by international standards (a Singapore phenomenon), but really good - excellent variety, covering all price points (by Singapore standards).Unfortunately, the service was patchy - overly attentive at times ("How is your dessert?" 2 seconds after it was put before you), and inattentive at others.We twice had to ask for wine glasses to be topped up - not acceptable in a top class restaurant, where the wine is not left on the table. No doubt that will improve.It was an expensive night out, but the food and wine justified the cost. And remember, leave room for dessert
5
We came here two times the same week for end of year celebrations. Once with a group. After we came back only 2 of us. With the group we had to wait for the lift but it worth to be patient. The service was pro. Food was very tasty. Good value for price. Just the wines were a bit too pricey. Should definetely try.
5
Enjoyed trying a couple of different plates which we shared and the view is just amazing overlooking the infinity pool and city skyline

Excellent food quality and remarkable service by Mr. Albert. He went beyond expectations. We'll be back. Thank you all

We ate in the Spago restaurant on Christmas eve. It's been open three months now and everything seems to be working pretty well. Our waiter was both expert and proud in describing each course starting with the signature tuna tartare cones as amuse bouche. The menu is largely Pacific rim, Californian & Japanese with some Mediterranean thrown in for good measure.We couldn't fault any of the dishes, which included starters of burrata & brussels sprouts, veal tartare and 'Kaya Toast' - basically fois gras given the Singaporean treatment with some pandan pineapple jam.The main courses were very much on the large side as were the accompaniments. None of us felt short changed with the Greek style lamb chops and New York sirloin steak. All very well presented and very well cooked. Two of us had enough room to share a delightful caramel souffle before we decided enough is enough.Two down sides; rather measly wine by the glass pourings given the S$25 - S$38 cost and intrusive 70's rock music that didn't seem to suit the colonial style decor and ambiance. Overall, the staff are trying hard to make Spago Singapore success and in general they are succeeding
4
We had drinks at the bar two nights running during our stay at Marina Bay Sands and would be happy to go again. Friendly team, good cocktails. Bar area is large, don't expect a great city view. No nuts/crisps/similar with the drinks, which is surprising given the cost of the drinks and the upscale nature of the venue
1
This was our second experience of the Spago bar. The first fantastic, although it took 30 mins to get a drink. This time however we were appalled in the first 10 minutes of arriving. Let's just say the matradee called me a liar, the bars staff was utterly rude to one of my guests shouting at her that she had ordered a drink upon which she explained she hadn't ordered a drink all evening or spoken to any of the staff. After dropping over $3000 on an evening I can say I won't be retuning. Such such a shame as the bar is stunning but I have never ever had such rude slow and abusive service
5
Me and my husband went to the lounge/bar at Spago just to take a drink and then continue somewhere else. But after the first drink and snack we were hooked ;-) The drinks was so good and the finger food was amazing. We ended up drinking a lot of drinks and ate almost all the dishes from their menu and we had the best time. Super great service and a nice ambiance. The prices is a little bit high but it is worth every penny. We didn't try the restaurant. Thank you Spago for the experience, we will come bac

Had high expectation for this restaurant after reading all the positive reviews. The ambience is nice- the music and the lighting's all good. It's generally good when it comes to service and food, too. Staff are friendly but not too attentive. We ordered a salad to start, squid ink pasta and mushroom risotto as our mains with a bottle of wine and two desserts to finish our dinner with. So far so good till when we called for our bill. The price of risotto is SGD 35 and the pasta was 48, but when we saw the bill, it became 70 and 72. Only when we checked with the staff, we were informed the entree portion was 35 and 48, however, we ordered the dishes as our mains, thus the price was doubled. We were not very happy, as they only had one dinner menu- there's no different categories stating Starters- Mains- Desserts. There's also no stated prices telling us main portion is charged differently from the starter's portion. Yes the restaurant manager came to us and explained a little, but it all didn't seem sincerely at all. In the end, she reduced the risotto's price back to the entree portion price which is 35. The food was nice with he price of 35 and 48, but definitely not worth 70, even it's supposed to be main course portion, it was not that big,either. All in all, ok restaurant, but make sure you check the price clearly before ordering.

went to the spago lounge for drinks (visit on tuesday if you want happy hour specials) their drinks are delicious, had a rum punch and had some smal bites (Quite pricey) in fact, for literaly hors'doeurve bites. But you are I guess paying for the view, if you're not staying at MBS, then this is your best bet to see Singapore skyline will enjoying the infinity pool view. I would reccomendtrying their chicken karage, its deliciious

Perched on Floor 57 of Marina Bay Sands, Spago is often considered a must visit among well heeled tourists in Singapore. Hotel inmates in wet towels & gym outfits flitting in and out the elevator, somehow didn't gel with what you'd expect en route to arguably one of the classiest restaurants in town. The infinity pool and the well lit Singapore skyline greet you as you set foot on the summit. The interiors of Spago was like what you'd expect from any high end bar - nothing extraordinary, except for the view of Singapore from different angles. Service came with a smile. We had just drinks here as we felt the food was overpriced. The cocktails we ordered : Warm and Fussy, Rough Love, Grin and Bear it - were all very nice. A place to visit in Singapore just for sheer experience
5
We went to Spago for a special family lunch and the experience was incredible. It is hard to think of anything that could have been done better. The food was wonderful, the service was warm and attentive, and the venue was beautiful. Highly recommended for a special occasion (or any meal). We will definitely be back
4
Cocktails were awesome with light canapes & bites. It's a good place to chilled out. Be prepared to pay premium prices for drinks!
5
We had drinks and tapas style small dishes in the lounge area, the food is outstanding, I particularly enjoyed the steak tartar - delicious! The location is outstanding with amazing views and an alfresco "LA" design feel.
5
I believe when we went to Spago's it had only been open a few weeks. The views are fantastic and the Cocktails made with diligence and flare! The vibe was fun and funky and staff seemed to love their working environment. Day time its lovely but night time is the time to go. You can even catch glimpse of the laser show.My only reservation was a staff member added their own $20 tip to my bill after I had finalized it...just a bit sneaky

My husband and I rarely go out to fancy restaurants in Singapore. We usually find them overpriced and over-fussy. But it was our anniversary and I wanted something special. I had to convince my husband to go to Spago at MBS and he was so glad I did. We had a great night out. First we had a drink in the bar which is really nice. There's an interesting bar menu too. Then we were taken to the dining room where we had a lovely dinner with excellent service. The acoustics and lighting in the restaurant are fantastic. For food -- our starters were awesome. We had roasted brussel sprouts with burrata cheese and fried parma ham and then we had the kaya toast foie gras which was incredible. For mains we had the lamb chops and the snapper laksa. For dessert we had a salted caramel souffle. We loved the food. Yes, the pool is outside the restaurant and people are swimming but I liked the contrast of the serene restaurant, the jaw dropping views and the people jumping in the pool. It was cool and different. The menu is inspired and full of surprises. And my husband was so thrilled with the music -- Led Zeppelin, Tom Petty, Dire Straits, Lenny Kravitz (not too loud at all)...stuff you never hear in SG. My husband ended up ordering an expensive glass of scotch to extend the dinner. I'm not sure who is behind the music at this restaurant, but well done

This is a review of the restaurant side of Spago Singapore... I will also offer some comments on the lounge at the end.Overall, a fairly mixed view - the food was actually good, the dessert very good and the wine list is both expensive and expansive - although no sommelier in sight, at least none came to speak to us. However the dining room lacks any sort of atmosphere.Starting with the food, the most startling aspect was the size of the menu which is minuscule - a single page of around 8 options for starters and about the same for mains (from memory) and with, to my taste, quite a limited selection. Whilst the manager was quick to point out the menu changes on a regular basis this doesn't quite make for a frequent destination - just too few options.The one stand-out was the dessert selection by pastry chef Michael Hadobas, which offered some very interesting dishes, including a terrific Citrus Pavlova. The Souffle is also very good.Service was OK - not incredibly warm but not bad. Very little to remember about it which is maybe not a great outcome.For the dining environment however, this is a pretty terrible design job.As already pointed out, view outside is great until you realize that the walkway in front of the restaurant is also the main access to the pool and you're treated to a constant barrage of hotel guests taking a dip, with a rather varied selection of fitness levels and swimwear designs. Makes you think twice at taking a dessert that's for sure.Secondly, the dining room itself is too narrow and badly designed - it is split between a first small section opening onto a small show kitchen and another larger section with a bar. The middle part hosts a series of wine cellars. Problem is that staff are constantly reaching in those fridges for wine - which creates a very bright light every time the doors are opened. Completely breaks the ambiance especially for dinners sat looking directly at the fridges.So overall, good place to try but in its current it cannot really warrant another visit, which seems a bit of a pity for a first foray of Spago in Asia. Seems like a fairly shy and tame effort rather than a real all-out and ambitious venture.The bar/lounge area is far better suited to the location - same swimmers in sight but frankly less of an issue there - lots of seating options, excellent staff and overall a very laid back but refined atmosphere - this really seems to work. We didn't stay very long but will return as this looks like a great spot for entertaining friends or clients

We arrived having eaten in the LA version of Spago several times. Got our free glass of champagne with our rewards card.Service was lacking, from the start, it reflects very badly on MBS standards, we had to pour our own wine for the rest of the evening.No free nibbles.We spent $350 on 2 starters, 2 mains and a bottle of wine. Food was ok, but nothing spectacular.No digestives offered.Had to ask for the bill twice.Not impressed.Marina Bay Sands scam
4
Getting to the restaurant is a little winding if you go to the wrong tower of MBS like we did. We had to wait for the restaurant staff to escort us to the restaurant via the very crowded infinity pool. This little inconvenience did not spoil our overall dining experience. The ambience was that of a cosy, romantic venue for special occasions. Service was good, staff was around when you needed them. Food was good. The Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut Laksa was mind blowing. Save some space for their Salted Caramel Souffle which was a generous portion and definitely to share. Soft and fluffy and not cloyingly sweet the soufflÃ© was a perfect dessert to end a very good meal

It all sounds so good on paper. Luxury restaurant located on the top floor of a casino where one of the most iconic swimming pools and city views exists... But alas they leave out the reality that your view is spoilt by the masses of overweight tourists in various cringe worthy swimsuits frolicking in the pools surrounding this fine restaurant. And when I say masses I mean MASSES. It's a mess out there.Luckily for Spago, the dining room is well insulated from the chaos ensuing outside. You just need to cover your eyes and ears for the short walk from the lifts to the dining room doors.Once through them you're treated to one of Singapore's better dining rooms. The design is luxurious but yet holds an air of casualness about it that makes you feel comfortable even if you haven't turned up in a dinner jacket.But let's get to the main event shall we? The cooking isn't up to the same standards as Wolfgang Puck's other outpost here; CUT. Don't be mistaken, it's very good, just isn't on the level CUT is, but don't let this deter you from giving the place a try, it is still very good cooking.The menu appears to be Californian in style, where the chef has taken inspiration from some local Singaporean dishes and imbued them with his western flair. And to a good extent he's really done a good job of it.I'l tried the "Kaya Toast", which had seared foie gras on a crispy tuile, coconut jam and foie gras mousse. It was really very good and stayed true to its roots and gave me hints of the Kaya toast us locals have for breakfast regularly.The Holland Veal Fillet Mignon Tartare had two bone marrows but was unimpressive. It looked pretty but had too much cream cheese. The Big Eye Tuna Tartare cones were very yummy. The tuna was very fresh and seasoned so nicely, and the cone was just the perfect level of thickness and crispness. You must order it.I had the Honey Miso Broiled Japanese Black Cod, which was a bit in the sweet side but I like it that way. It came gorgeously plated like everything else and tasted even better.One friend tried the Pan Roasted Organic Chicken "Pastrami" which was "superb". Juicy, tasty, and perfectly tender. I avoided it because I always want something more special than chicken breast but my goodness this was good!Another friend tried the veal chop which was well cooked but nothing mind blowing. You can see all the dishes in the images attached with this review.The highlight of the night was surprisingly one of the sides; the roasted Brussels Sprouts, shiro miso, yuzu citrus. This one was mind blowing. It is a MUST order. I've never had such good Brussels Sprouts in my life. If my mother fed me these as a child I may have turned vegetarian.All in all a very good night out but be prepared to pay a pretty penny and to avert your eyes at the unimpressive entrance and pool frolickers

I picked this for a business lunch. Its on sky 57 at MBS bit of a journey to get to with two elevators. However the view fit and and staff make the venue a lovely one. Service is polished. The menu is billed as "californian" and whilst i could see some notes of that I did not get the mix. The menu for lunch is very short which in of its self not always bad but my guest and I did struggle to find anything stand out.However I would have to say we both agreed the food was disappointing and extremely expensive. The prawn salad starter was quite nice but the mains failed. My Weiner Schnitzel was quite terrible it came out all puffed up and ballon like. When you put the fork it it just crumbles in an odd way. The veal was not tender and under seasoned. One astute waiter saw me struggling and tried to point out it that the "chef does it that way". However we later saw another tables same dish go back. Its a bit like the old club sandwhich conundrum - leave it alone the original was fine! My guest had the lobster roll which looked good but quite small.The wine list is extremely expensive by the glass - all hovering around the 28$ which when you add service and tax is well above 30 - crazy. The bottled water was 12$ plus taxes. There was only one USA wine by the glass which was odd when the menu is "californian".At the end i had to take a call an odered another wine which the waiter said was complimentary - nice touch.All up it could be amazing but I think the menu needs an overhaul and some more affordable wine options especially at lunch as it was not that busy

We attended this restaurant on a Friday evening as a last minute booking and their staff went out of their way to squeeze us in, it was appreciated.The dining experience at the restaurant is very elegant and high quality. The background music was great as it created a very chilled relaxed atmosphere. It was nice to meet Exec Chef Greg, his passion for food is very evident.Very enjoyable, would do it again
