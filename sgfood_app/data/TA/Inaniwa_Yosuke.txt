Loved their cold udon and also the hot version. Go for both the sesame n soya version for the cold udon. I personally prefer the soya version. Kids below 4 gets free udon!
5
Really good food for the price ! Friendly service. Beef udon was delicious and ikura don super good ! Would definitely come back üòä.
4
the 1 for 1 lunch set was pretty value for money, which serves a portion of soba noodles, and some chirashidon - soba was quite decent, though was a little disappointed by the chirashi
4
Best udon ever! Must try if you haven't. I'm not a fan of udon but this is a different type. Very nice and yummy. Been there twice and still satisfied with the quality.
4
If you like thin soba, this is it. Served hot or cold. The tempura is also very good. The wait is a bit long .
3
Price was ok as there was a 1 for 1 promo. The cold udon was much better than the hot. The fried chicken was not bad. Price is steep without promotion.
5
Absolutely perfect for a casual lunch where you go deep on the joys of udon, a great place and can totally recommend !
5
Frankly I am not an udon fan but having tried Inaniwa Yosuke, I am sold. Its udon is thin unlike the typical thick udon. The soup is not salty nced. order the one for one promotion, it is worth it.
4
Small but appropriate japanese restaurant in the japan food town at Wisma Atria. Food was fine but price is a little bit on the high side, even with their weekly promotions.
5
Udon and tempura is really good! Ordered the 1 for 1 lunch set promotion, and it's really value for money. Service was great too!
4
this is my 4th visit here. came back because the previous 3 times the food was amazing. however this time was slightly disappointed in their prawn tempura which i felt was not up to their usual standard
5
The beef udon is a must eat. Udon was thin and smooth. Broth was clear and just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness. Perfect!!
4
First time for me trying cold udon with Goma sauce. Pleasantly surprised by the thin and smooth udon and goes very well with the goma dressing. Delicate taste and delightful. The tempura was just nicely cooked
4
Lunch menu is quite valuable, the cold udon was very nice with al dente texture. The service was excellent.
3
Udon was indeed authentic and great, as promised but extremely overpriced as well. Add-ons such as condiments and beverages were priced way too high too.
5
Ramen had really nice texture
Warm ramen had very light broth
Tempura not bad
Atmosphere was awesome
Staff was friendly and attentive
2
Came to try this restaurant after reviews on TripAdvisor but sad to say it did not live up to my expectation. Whilst service was good, the Yakiniku Udon in soup was too salty, making it impossible to drink. The beef had a strong smell which was not good. Left disappointed
5
A surprise visit to this restaurant that served quality udon at affordable price. The kake udon is so silky smooth with satisfying broth! The curry udon was equally tasty n good. We enjoyed drinking the Highball whisky. A must visit restaurant in orchard Rd. I felt like I‚Äôm in Japan again.
5
Service was really good, especially by the Japanese lady. Inaniwa udon is a rare find in Japanese restaurants in Singapore, so I was really glad to come across this place. The cold udon has a really nice chewy texture, even more value for money if you go for the weekday lunch sets! (Also noticed that the place was frequented by many Japanese - a testament of authenticity?)
4
Inaniwa Yosuke is the place that brings the focus on its main ingredient - Udon, which is often casted as a supporting role in other dishes. Udon is the hero.My wife and I came for dinner and we enjoyed the simple and traditional way of experiencing this delicacy in cold and dipped with soy sauce, bringing out the texture and earthliness of the udon. It's beautiful.Decoration was simple but appropriate. Service was responsive and friendly but we can see improvements in turns of coordination and quicker time to clean the table before the next patron.Overall it was an enjoyable dining experience
4
If you like expertly made cold Udon served in a quasi-Japanese setting, this is the place to go in Singapore. Their other dishes are traditional and tasty izakaya fare with no real standouts. The staff is courteous without faking it too much.
5
Been here a few times. The food here is great. Please keep up the good work and dont let the standard drop. Kids under 4 get free udon. Service is ok but slightly disorganised. Training is needed.
5
Nice both cold and hot udon prepared in perfection . We always came back for more. Good service and convenient location.
3
Udon is good, as is the tamagoyaki with mentaiko. Tempura was mediocre. Like many other places in Singapore, overall this place is overpriced and poor value for money.
4
A nice and quiet place to have a meal and catch up with friends.
Great service
Recommend for small groups or couples
4
Not a fan of udon but this udon is tasty. Love the broth. Light and tasty. The service is impeccable.
5
abit pricey but i've eaten there 4 times already and i love their tempura and cold soba. their weekday lunch sets are value for money
5
Great service from friendly server who is very attentive. Also, wonderful cold soba and tempura! Will be back again.
5
We ordered both the hot and the cold udons and enjoyed both - the hot version had a light, yet tasty broth, whereas we ordered the cold udon with both sauces. Both sauces were delicious in their own way. The set was also pretty tasty - the tempura wasn‚Äôt particular memorable but definitely above average, and also came with potato salad, chicken karaage, sashimi and more. Will return again!
4
First ate at their branch at Haneda airport and it was so good we bought back a box along with their excellent shoyu dipping sauce . So was really happy to learn they opened an outlet in Japan town, Wisma. This is my 3rd visit and I envisage there will be more repeated visits as my son like their seiro udon while I like the tempura set. Udon is silky smooth and the cold shoyu dipping sauce is just the right mixture of umami and saltiness . Only item that disappoints is the salmon sashimi but to be fair it is not a speciality of this restaurant
4
The cold udon is very refreshing. Only managed to try it with the soy sauce. Will try with the sesame sauce next time.
4
Very nice texture. Love the cold udon, i ordered a 2nd portion! Slurps! The hot udon soup is also very tasty.
Tried the yuzu tori tendon too, i think its a little blend for my liking thou. But 2 thumbs up for the cold udon.
4
Had the chilled udon with 2 sauces. The udon texture was very good. Do not expect the usual thick strand of noodle, this udon is almost like thin kwayteow. Overall, good ambience
4
This is so far our favourite udon place in Singapore! Great ambience and friendly service staff. Great food!
4
Small cosy japanese restaurant right in Wisma, Orchard. Location was good. Food was ok. Got to try their udon!
4
Good location in orchard. Friendly staff.
Great udon for good value. Especially like the cold udon. Will visit again!
4
Very nice smooth thin udon. Different from the conventional udon i have tried previously. Definitely a must try esp now that they have a special promotion for a set of cold & hot udon till 24 Sep 17.
5
The taste of the udon is excellent and wonderfully. üòã
My boy loves it so much, he finished it all by himself!
4
The kakiage udon set lunch is value for money! At the price of $13.80, it comes with a kakiage rice + udon (we chose hot udon).Udon is thin, chewy and easy on the stomach. Loving how the kakiage goes so well with the Japanese rice. Will definitely re visit this restaurant again!
3
Apart from the price not too bad. We all had noodles with tempura. The noodles were good but very average tempura. Mushy shrimp, slice of sweet potato or similar, lotus root. Worst was the price. At the listed price of $18.50 it was expensive but then with 10% service charge which was a big surprise and GST the bill for lunch was $70.00. Not worth more than $50.00. Service and ambience good
5
Inaniwa Yosuke is a wonderful escape and delight for the taste buds. Their noodles are have a lovely chewy texture. The tempura is must with the fresh ingredients and crispy batter üç§and fragrant dipping sauce. Highly recommended üåü
4
Simple but authentic, delicious udon and the dessert was not just pretty but just nice on the palate, ie. not too sweet. Friendly, attentive staff. Felt like I was in Japan. Reasonably priced with ongoing promotions.
5
One of the nicest udon restaurants I've tried in Singapore. I really like the smoothness and texture of the noodles. I had the curry udon which I find very savoury and tasty. The atmosphere is nice and cosy. Service is great!
5
Really delicious soba. Good service by Japanese staff. A wonderful lunch. Feel just like in Japan. Oishi !
5
Awesome food! Definitely worth a visit. Cold udon and tempura is the way to go! The kimchi was also the best I've had.
5
Delicious udon yummy yummy
service is excellent fast and friendly
will definitely come and visit again
5
Fantastic cold udon with chewy texture :)
Love the ambiance and the staff are friendly and helpful , will visit again !
4
The in house speciality Inaniwa udon was well cooked. The prawn and vegetable tempura are fresh and done well. Ambience are simple but cosy. The staff are well trained and served us well.
4
Amazing udon, love the texture of the noodles. Service is friendly and good. Would definitely come back again!
4
Weekday lunch was not crowded at all, I had the counter all to myself. Had the cold udon, salmon & ikura on sushi rice set ($16.80++) plus onsen egg, tofu skin and chicken karage. The udon and sushi rice were great and the rest also good. You can top up the udon with additional half or full portions for $4 and $8 respectively. Relaxing ambience.
4
The service was prompt and attentive from the moment we sat down. The inaniwa udon was springy and delicious with the sesame dressing. Also, the tempura was light and crisp, and not doughy like at Tendon Itsuki or Tamoya.
4
The udon here is thin and the soya dipping sauce has shiso leaves!!!!! Food service was fast as well and the atmosphere is very pleasant ~
5
First time trying this place. Expecting the Udon to be those fat and thick type. It came out to be nicely flat and slim. Love the 'bouncy' texture!
5
The udon serve is truly authentic, best udon ever eaten in Singapore. The service staff available were also attentive to our requests.
5
Food taste truly authentic.. The udon freshness is bar none. The chef's effort in making the food can be felt.
Please keep up the great work! üëç
5
First visit to this place after reading all the rave reviews.
Fantastic udon with light tasty soup
Gyudon was a major surprise. Fantastic as well.
Put it on your list if you are nearby.
5
The texture of the udon is chewy and flavourful, while the other food items are fresh and delicious. It's an enjoyable experience dining here with the soothing atmosphere. Staff are friendly and easy to communicate with.
5
Great food , especially the udon , so chewy . Reasonable price , fast service , will definitely come back again .
5
The taste is extraordinary, especially the cold udon and the texture. We come here regularly and quality is always consistent.
5
This is by far the best udon I've tried in Singapore & I've been to the Owariya restaurant in Kyoto for their udon. The Inaniwa Udon requires excellent culinary skills to bring out its best flavor & texture & the chef in this restaurant managed to achieve that. Definitely a must-try!!
5
Loved the simplicity of the dishes and the udon was amazing! Would be better for the lunch crowd as the dinner was quite pricey.
5
Best meal I have ever had. The service was superb and they really bothered to explain what is on the menu to you. The ambience is also really soothing. Perfect for a quiet family meal
5
Ordered Seiro Udon (Cold) with Shoyu and Goma Sauce...so yummy! üòã
The staff are very friendly and pleasant.
Highly recommended for those who love Japanese food like me.
Will definitely come back and bring my family here! Cheers! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòäüëçüèº
5
Went for the lunch special and ordered hot and cold soba sets. The soba texture is very smooth and tasty. Value for money as well.
Been here few times and will come again
4
Great food. Service by Mami was excellent! Look for her! Love the udon. Soup base clear and tasty. Lunch sets are value for money.
5
The cold udon was the best. It had good selection of Japanese drinks too, like hakaisan sake, suntory highball, and kirin beer. We really felt like being in Japan instead of Singapore.
4
Inaniwa udon is more delicate than the sanuki style. Try the warm version. The excellent dashi stock is light and comforting.
5
Lunch set was worth it with nice udon soup base. Udon was very springy. Will definitely return to try cold udon.
4
Great service and good tasty udon. Had the tempura cold udon set pretty decent. Recommended ok cold udon.
4
I am glad that I tried this among other restaurants at Japanese Food town in Wisma. The udon I ordered was the sukiyaki beef soup . The noodles and soup were very fresh .The other item I ordered was the Bara kakiage which would be even nicer if there was sake or beer. I will visit again.
5
Udon had delicious texture and we ordered the two sauce set with tempura set. Service staff were attentive and pleasant environment. Very cosy to visit during weekdays. We will be back!
3
I had the hot beef udon. The broth is sweet and delicious. The udon is thin and easy to eat. Great service, friendly staff.
5
Great udon! I had the curry udon during lunch and it was delicious. Really chill and nice ambience too
4
Nice Udon, very good service, and nice atmosphere. It's not crowded during lunch and it is a good place for a quiet lunch
4
Stopped by for a quick lunch. First time I have ever seen thin udon, but the texture was really great. I tried the udon chilled, which made it feel a lot like soba, but it's delicious overall.
3
The tempura was not bad and the udon were good, though at close to $100 for 2 (set with "discount"), it is fairly lumpy. Thus just order a la carte.
Staff polite and venue is pretty.
5
My favourite place for meet up and dine with friends.
Must try salmon sashimi, prawn tempura and of course in house specialty Inaniwa udon. Try Seiro Udon if you're here for the first time.
3
We had beef udon with shrimp tempura. On the pricey side but if you like udon, it is a good option to try. And there is a promotion going for 2nd set, u get $10 discount.
2
I was very thrilled to have found this restaurant because their udon is really smooth and refreshing. However I was very disappointed upon receiving my bill. I felt that their $10 off pair set is very misleading. My dining partner also had the impression that we were only supposed to pay the price of the a la carte main dish and it should include the side dish and drink. Our lunch bill came up to $40 per pax because they charged us the a la carte price for every item. Why do you call it a set when you're charging a la carte prices? I feel that this form of advertising is out to cheat people's money. Even the Japanese waitress admitted that their promo was misleading and that she'd feedback to her management. I looked at past reviews and others have also posted negative feedback on this promo. I hope the management can either make this promo clearer or just remove it totally to avoid unhappy customers. I really liked the udon the restaurant makes, but sadly my dining partner will not be visiting it again as we feel cheated
5
I ordered the hot beef soup udon and it was really satisfying. The meat is tender and the soup is not very salty. The service is great, like the ambience of the restaurant. Highly recommended for lunch. Food comes fast and an add on - their green tea is good
5
Great service with nice udon; authentic feel to the restaurant too. The lunch menu is also of pretty good value
5
Came here for the Udon and ordered beef udon, Salmon Sashimi, Mental Dashimaki, and Yuzu-Tori Tendon. Very cosy and Japanese style. Services are Japanese standard high, too. Worth a chilling dinner.
4
Our family enjoy the udon both not and cold very much, just right texture. Restaurant has a relaxing and nice ambient. The service is good too. If the menu can have more item or change periodically, that will be even better. Will definitely revisit again.
5
We enjoyed our lunch here. We had seafood salad, udon, beef rice etc. All of them are very tasty. I would recommend.
5
Ambience and service is good. The Udon is soft, very smooth and tasty. It melts in your mouth. First time in Inaniwa Yosuke brought by my friend Patrick. Will come back again.
5
Brought by my good friend Teresa for lunch. One of the best inaniwa udon I have tasted. I ordered inaniwa set. Good ambience and very good service.
5
I have lunch with a group of friends at this cosy and friendly restaurant.
I ordered Tempura Udon. The udon was
Smooth and silky. The soup was appetizing too. It is also located at Wisma Atria where you can shop at the same time.
5
Best inaniwa udon in Singapore. Very smooth and the soup is tasty. High quality good ambience and good service.
5
The cold Udon is so succulent and smooth
I love the crispy tempura and every mouthful is mouth-watering. I enjoy their friendly service and the green tea is yummy too.;))
4
After eating some not so tasty udon, I have sworn off these form of Japanese noodles for years. Until my discovery of this restaurant which serves the renowned Inaniwa udon. I can finally enjoy udon! And compared to some of the other eateries in the Japan Food Town, which I find of dubious standards and highly overpriced, the food here is extremely value for money and not expensive at all. They are serving udon and rice sets so you can enjoy the best of both carbs. And the Japanese speaking kitchen and service staff enhance the whole dining experience. But you'll have to be sitting at the counter to enjoy that
5
Ordered the tempura and udon (hot and cold) and it was simply yummy!! Enjoyed every bit of this meal and will definitely be back again üòÅüëçüèºüëçüèº
5
The udon is as smooth as silk and the soup is delicious. The vegetables are fresh. The prawn is crispy. I enjoy this place with my family. The waiter, Hou, is very helpful and kind. I love her serviceüòç
5
Good soba, love it cold as well as hot. Is my third time having lunch at this restaurant . Good service
5
The hot udon with bonito soup is damn good. The texture of the cold udon with sesame sauce is also delicious. Service is awesome, staff is extremely friendly. Had a wonderful experience.
5
Had the tendon for lunch. Fresh ingredients, authentic tasting. Would come back. The lunch menu is great value and good for personal or business meals
5
Skinny udon that's so smooth and chewy. Love the cold dip noodles. Best in Singapore that I've tasted.
4
The cold udon with the special source is yummy!üòã Value for money especially the set lunch menus. Relax & quiet environment. The waitresses are very friendly & helpful. Will definitely come back for it. üëç
4
Udon texture is good. Reasonably priced set meals. Worth a visit. Service is good, friendly and prompt.
5
nice udon with a great soup base. the tempura was also good with a light batter.another item was the dashi tamago....nice
5
It's a quaint little outlet with much to offer, don't come in here expecting the conventional udon, but their own special version which has a much smoother texture than what we're most familiar with. The dipping sauce for the cold udon was soaked right up by the noodle, and the hot udon's soup was light and sweet.
2
Overpriced food for quite common variety. The service is ok. But the food could really be better....
4
Excellent place with very tasty udon. The whole place feels like im in japan again.
Very friendly and helpful staffs too.
5
The quality of udon served is fantastic and authentic with texture similar to the one in Japan, which is quite hard to find in Singapore. The lunch set menu is definitely worth the money!
4
I like the service staff .the food here is always serve hot and the waiting time is short.if you invite friends for lunch ,no regret recommended this restaurant
5
Excellent udon quality....
Quiet and pleasent atmosphere served by highest level of staff service..
Will definitely return and make it as a regular choice for the family for udon!!
5
The udon is nice and yummy! Service is good too! Children under 4 gets free udon. Beef udon is nice and recommended!
4
This is our fist visit here. The cold udon is delicious üòã. We will visit again and I will recommend this place to my friends and family.
5
I like the udon here because the udon is thin, flat, shining & smooth. I think I will come here often for the udon. The service staff are polite too.
5
Nice, causal and cosy dining environment for friends and family. Udon is highly recommended. Lastly, friendly and prompt services. Whole experience feel like you are having your meal in Japan.
5
This restaurant prides itself in it's soba and I can understand why. I had the hot and cold soba set, it came with a hot ume taste broth with a cold choice of soba with nice sesame or traditional dip. They are however, not the traditional thick kind of soba but more like a ramen in terms of thickness.The sashimi was good and the tempura prawns were perfectly done, crispy, fresh and no oily after taste.Ambience was of a typical Japanese restaurant, woody and intimate.Service is efficient and warm.Good for sake as well
5
A great place to bring the family for an authentic Udon experience. Believe the Udon is hand made and texturally is superior to the frozen variety . Certainly recommend if you have Udon on your mind !
5
Super well made Udon and the Slow Cooked Beef for the Mini Don was super soft and delicious!! Highly recommend!!
5
Best idol that I have tried. Highly recommended. Will definitely visit again with. Y family. Good accessible location within one of Singapore's famous street, orchard road.
5
They had great set lunches! Affordable and filling.
Service was really good and we will definitely come back again!
5
Udon was fantastic and authentic. Great atmosphere, great service and friendly staff! Look forward to coming back again!
5
The ladies set was delicious, and very good. The beef udon set was also exceptional. We will definitely be back!
5
This isn't my first time at the restaurant. The quality of food is always good and the service excellent.
5
Not many Japanese restaurants in Singapore offer chilled udon, much less one of quality rivaling what you can get in Japan. I was so blown away by the Tororo chilled udon during my first visit that I went back for a second time a week later (and ate the same dish).Food: The chilled udon glistens appealingly, and is chewy but so smooth that it simply glides down your throat. Flavours are delicate and upon adding the condiments, you will taste fleeting hints of each - I especially like the yuzu(?). Also, the wasabi is not the usual wasabi paste you get in most restaurants - it's the real deal here, and tastes so good I can eat it on its own.Service: Service was efficient during my first visit during weekend lunch (3 sets of customers including myself), but when I came back for weekend dinner (restaurant was filled) the second time, service level dropped quite a bit, in terms of difficulty in catching the busy staff's attention and wait time for food. Essentially, we spent more time waiting than anything else.Overall, I am impressed with the quality of food, but would probably avoid going during peak periods
5
Had a hot udon with beef kakuni don set and it was fantastic! The hot dashi broth was flavourful and when mixed with the condiments (ginger, shiso, and spring onions) leaves a lingering taste after every spoonful of noodles and soup. The beef kakuni was soft and had the right amount of fat as well! Service wise, you will feel like you're in Japan with their attention to details and standards. Thumbs up
5
Lovely restaurant located at level 4 of Wisma Atria. The japanese lady who served us was polite and friendly - a gem in the service industry.I enjoyed the Ten-Don set which comprises yummy udon (you can choose to have it cold/hot), a bowl of fresh tempura with rice and refreshing pudding.Thumbs up
5
Delicious food! Lunch set was very value for money. Everything we ordered was yummy and the four of us ordered three different items :)
5
Damn good udon! Warm udon, cold udon, curry udon are all yummy.. Plus we love their appetizers.. Enough said, just eat! Oh, and leave some space for desserts too üòÅ
5
Delicious. I like the set much. It includes noodles, appetizers and dessert. I think it's a nice place too. Suitable for friends' gathering. The location is also convenient, at Orchard CBD. U can also dp some shoppings after lunch.
4
Generally pretty good sides but really amazing udon. Prices are a little too steep though. Good service!
5
Wonderful food and service! The lunch set was affordable and very filling! Will definitely come back!!
5
Udon is really good and soft! Really lives up to expectations. Service staff was also very attentive! Definitely recommend this for udon lovers.
5
Inaniwa Yosuke restn serves authentic udon, which is of thin and very smooth texture. We ordered the Ajikurabke set which comprises of hot and cold udon, prawn katsu n a bowl of tomato curry udon. Its our 2nd time patronising this restn and we have not been disappointed by the yummy food, good service n good ambience
5
My sis and I had one of the best inaniwa udon here. Reminds us of the good delicious udon we had in Japan! Inaniwa udon is a rare find in Singapore restaurants and it is really really good Here! The soup base was light yet flavourful, the grated yam dip with the slippery thin udon really gave it extra oomph. The Salmon Oyako is highly recommended Too! Lastly, excellent service from the staff. Will come back for more! :)
5
Came here twice, once with my best friend and the second time with my husband. We ordered Seiro Udon (I ate this! ), Umbe Oboro, Dashimaki Tamago () and Dashimaki Mentai (). The food here never disappoints. The udon has a spring to it and the shoyu and goma sauces compliment the udon so well. The dashimaki tamago is my favourite too~ Love the subtle dashi flavour~
3
Had the cold udon with assorted tempura as extra. The udon was chewy (QQ) which is how udon should be. There were 2 sauces to go with the udon, the normal soy sauce and the shop's sesame sauce. I had to pay a little extra for both sauces. My preference was the sesame sauce. The assorted tempura was just normal.
