This place was buzzing with customers on their laptops and doing little else. we ordered coffee and a pastry but the coffee was not hot, pity. Could not be bother to take it back inside and queue for another.

Just over the road from the Park Hotel in a shopping mall. Great coffee even if a little pricey. Has a few outside seats and more inside in the air con. Good service from the staff.

Tucked away in the U E shopping mall, at Clemenceau Ave, this functional, but worthwhile coffee shop does not disappoint.
Very good coffee, excellent ice tea and very enjoyable cakes.

We discovered this coffee bar just around the corner from out hotel ‚Äì convenient for a simple breakfast.Speciality coffees and unusual breakfast options, made this an interesting experience.My wife and I both chose a guacamole and poached egg open sandwich and it was slightly disconcerting to find that the poached egg was barely cooked ‚Äì maybe normal here in Singapore, but not for us. The sandwich was very tasty, but another time we would ask for the egg to be cooked much longer.Total cost for 2 coffees and 2 hot sandwiches was SIN$31.5
