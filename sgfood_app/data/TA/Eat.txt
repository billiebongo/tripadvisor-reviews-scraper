This is a cheep and reasonable quality place to brag I bit to eat.
I had the homemade shrimp dumplings. Very tasty.
On the day I visited the staff were issued new aprons!

This little noodle shop serves local style noodles and drinks at relatively cheap prices compared to the Food Courts within the shopping mall. The taste is average but value for money. Okay for a quick bite if you are not too particular about the taste.
