Had a department event here, and ordered the beef pasta, which was pretty decent. We sat in a private area on the 2nd Level shophouse, well decorated to the Christmas theme.
4
We stopped here for a drink and had a seat overlooking the water which was lovely. Service was prompt and they had free wifi, although I don't quiet understand why the waitress had to enter the code into my phone for me.
5
I had four evenings here, it was one of the most genuine dining experiences I've ever had in Singapore with prompt friendly and honest service and a delightful outlook. I met lots of interesting people and the beer is good. The food , well it doesn't pretend to be any more than a pub, you get pub grub and it's not bad at al
4
Visited the Penny Black 3 times whilst on holiday. Happy hour and for food several times.The food was really good, burgers were done to our asking too.Typical pub feel, screens to watch the sports if you wish...though due to time difference some were on late.Outside they have seating next to the quay, Singapore river. The views at night of the quay and buildings lit up are fabulous
3
As a pub this place seems pretty fun but my review is of the flood. Besides the location and the ex-pat menu there is not much good to say. The service was so so and the food was mehâ€”
5
So far I've had two lovely meals this week with a few more to go. The service has been very prompt and friendly and the beer great. A superb location and simply where everyone ends up with some great ex pat atmosphere but not too noisy. Met folk I'd not bumped into since 1979 which shows the whole world revolves around this place, clean, tastey and hits the spot, so glad I came
1
when we entered bar waiter gave us menu, but never came back to get our order. at the end one of us needed to go inside the bar and place our order. so finally we get our order on the table. my wine glass got lipstick stained!and i asked for a new glass, and the waiter gave me a plastic cup instead and asked if i am ok with it? basically, i am from service line as well.. i understand from a guest point of view. but the service here need to be improve.
3
It's about as close to a British pub as you'll find in Singapore, and you can get a good pint of Guinness there too. We sat outside beside the river, which was a very pleasant way to just sit and watch the world go by. You'll often need to reserve a table if you want to get the best tables right on the Riverfront though, unless you're not eating at popular times. The food was very good and well cooked. We opted for the set menu at $25 for two courses, and ate the Thai beef and grilled snapper. If you eat off the regular menu Andrew order befor 18:30 you get a 20% discount. This doesn't apply to the set 2-3 course menu though
4
Had lunch here. Good service and wholesome food in a lovely setting on the riverbank. Needed to be reasonably quick and they were
4
Penny Black is an infamous drinking hole by the water - so it's usually loud, fun and bubbly with beers from around the world. if that's your thing, this is your place. However, I recently had a lovely Sunday brunch by myself after the lunch time. It was so peaceful and quiet, and the service quite friendly, too. The food exceeds expectation. I had a stylish salad of some interesting mix and a thick soup - all quite tasty, definitely many notches above standard bar food. Of course, you can't beat the view - stunning to look at the sites and there's interesting people watching, too. A fun place which suits many moods
5
Great little pub with outside seating on the river. I love to sit in the outside area next to the river and relax. Always my first place to start my walk down Boat Quay to Clark Quay.
4
The pub offers the expected British theme with a reasonable choice of beers. On a warm evening its offers a lovely place to simply sit on the riverside and enjoy a decent pint along with the excellent mini fish and chips
3
The mini pizza is about 15cm in diameter, so fits the description of MINI. Service was slow, even though the place wasn't crowded. On the plus it was easy to get a waterfront seat. When you go inside, they are running air so it's about 5-10C cooler and may suit some folk
4
This pub chose itself as it probably was the only one in Singapore to be showing our Premier League match live!. It became apparent why, when we turned up in the evening, as it had morphed into the official fan club pub for our opponents! Not sure how a London pub became a base for Newcastle? Turned out one of our hotel managers was a Newcastle supporter! Good atmosphere. Worth checking out as a central base for watching footie without any hassle.Anyway, also went there earlier in the day, nice covered seating outside on the water, great views of the Quay, Raffles statue etc..Very pleasant servers both visits, nice people all round
4
At the end of Boat Quay with seating by the river or insideGood to watch all sports. Visited Sunday for lunch. Number of people in watching the F1Good atmosphere, service and foo
5
I always enjoy lunch and a cold beer or two at Penny Black on Clarke Quay. Reasonably priced (for Singapore) and good choice and quality of food. Very relaxing after strolling along the river or around Marina Bay
5
This corner restaurant by the river boasts a good view of the river (if seated outdoors), has decent food, but was most impressed by the good service of the bubbly waitress there. First time there with my girlfriend to grab a quick meal after work, but certainly not the last; will come back again
4
Located right by the river, this is a great place to catch up with friends or watch the world go by. Good for a beer, a gin and tonic, finger foods or a full meal.
4
I was heading to Harry's to watch the Sunday afternoon nrl game only to find the Harry's no longer has live football. So called in next door to find an truly excellent British pub. Expensive drinks ( but that's any where in the tourist spots of Singapore) it's reasonable during happy hour and they service all the pub classic meals. Well worth a visit
4
Decent choice of (pricey) beer, and whilst the food isnt great it is better than Harry's (next door). The pizzas they bring in from outside but are pretty good. Staff are friendly and reasonably efficient. Nice to sit outside on the riverfront and watch the world go by. They show most major sporting events with commentary on.
5
Great atmosphere. Reasonably priced drinks. Friendly staff. Great sport coverage. Really good to start a Saturday night off at.
5
This is a British- styled pub in the Clarke Quay complex. We visited here during a massive rain storm. Greeted by friendly, attentive staff and great atmosphere. Well appointed decor...and it's the Newcastle UFC fan spot in Singapore! Great ale served at the right temperature. I enjoyed a pint of Speckled Hen...not my normal beer but very good. Certainly worth popping in if you're visiting Clarke Quay
4
Not my first visit to this pub but we dived in because of the rain. Excellent food and drinks and the staff are very friendly. It was not a problem to sit inside even though we had our 3 year old daughter with us. I can recommend the lamb chops!
4
After a day of being a tourist in the heat the cold one under shade at the Penny Black in boat quay was perfect. Friendly and helpful staff and a good selection of drinks. The food selection looked good although we didn't go there to eat.
4
This is the first bar/pub to find as you enter Boat Quay from the finanicla district side. As such it gets a lot of "city types" both local and expat and there are times it wil lbe busy soon after trading. However, its still a reasonable pub in a prime location with outdoor seating on the river. Being the first one it has the advantage of a bit more breeze, it can get hotter as you move into the Quay. Good drinking hole and home to the Newcastle supporters of Singapore (not many of them local, obviously). Good for sport and starting the night
5
Excellent English pub in Boat Quay. Has a good mixed crowd of locals, expats and tourists. Fantastic place to watch sport, particularly rugby. Has quite a regular crowd and staff service is friendly. Food menu is British pub food. The riverside is great for tourists to relax and sit by the river. Nice for people watching and watching the world go by
3
Good for watching rugby union. outside has no sound. Sound was on inside. Menu typically British. small serves. service ok
4
We stopped at The Penny Black for lunch. It has outside seating so you can sit right next to the river and watch the world go by. We opted for a drink and a light lunch and it was served quickly and the food was good pub food. There are lots of restaurants along this part of the river bank so you will have plenty of choice but we would have no hesitation about going back to this place
3
We visited here on a Friday evening from the office. It was busy at that time but it took ages to get served. Was also difficult to find anyone when we wanted another round. And when we did they took ages and got the order wrong. Range of drinks was good. Probably a lot better when it's not so busy
3
Called in for a bite to eat, a few beers, and as it turned out, to watch my football team getting humiliated on the large screen.Service was good, as the waitress was very attentive, food was good ( Fish & Chips for me, Lamb Chops for my wife), Tiger Beer was chilled and tasty (though expensive at S$13 a pint), and the atmosphere was OK (until Rangers got humped), so all in all it wasn't a bad experience but I always felt like a tourist in an area that's very popular with tourists, hence the average tag.There was nothing to criticise but there was nothing to suggest, this is the bar I've been looking for. If however, you're the type of person that likes travelling half way round the world to eat British pub food in an English themed pub, then this might just be the place for you. Enjoy
4
Good pub grub at reasonable prices. Good selection of beers and well made cocktails, Nice atmosphere and a great place to catch up on sport on the TV
4
Walking to the museum suddenly came across a London pub lol so had to try their beer, it is done exactly like a London boozer so very comfortable not sure about prices I haven't paid yet ???
3
Getting more runned down since last time we were there. And service is slower too.. But ok to have a beer and watch some sports
4
Had Fish n Chips for lunch with a lemon lime bitters and a pint of Guinness on St.Patrick's Day. Great location, food, drinks and service. Very relaxing. Was a busy day, so staff was a bit lost. Only one little issue. One of the staff members dropped a fork on the very dirty floor, picked it up quickly, gave it a quick brush and put it back in the tray for setting up tables. Oops
3
It's a beautiful place to enjoy your beer in the evening with lovely breeze and good view. The place is usually booked so better to make pre-arrangements or arrive early. Food is good and especially the spicy chicken wings are good snacks but the service is extremely slow. In fact after waiting for 30 min for our snacks when we checked again they said it will take another 15-20 min so we had to cancel our second order. Price is average but you can enjoy happy hours till 8.
3
It looks a bit run down inside. They do play the english football games but they don't have many televisions. It's not really a comfortable place to hang out
4
Like any regular visitor to Singapore I am familiar with the Penny Black as a reliable venue for food, drink and people watching. On this occasion I attended a 60th birthday party in the upstairs function room.The upstairs is just as authentically decorated as downstairs. It was a great party made even better by well served food and drink. The staff were just fantastic, particularly as most of the guests were aging oil field trash and well lubricated
4
While enjoying my cold beer sitting near the river at Boat Quay decided to have a meal. Wasn't disappointed had the Chicken Parmigiana which came with wedges and salad and tasted really good. Great place to relax and enjoy a cold beverage and if in the mood a feed. Will be going back
3
We stopped here for a quick drink and bar snacks as we walked around Singapore. Service was a bit slow but the bar snacks were fine. We had wings and fish fingers which helped assage hunger without being too large. Not fine dining but a nicy buzzy place to stop
4
Good location on the river and a good atmosphere, being fairly busy. Was expensive for a beer however
4
Great people ! everyone there was drinking at least one drought at one time ;) I saw a lot of corporate employees letting them free with good beer and good music ! fantastic mood ! Very crowded, like everyone near that gulf came there. Enjoy
4
We met our friends here for lunch. I ordered a traditional bacon butty and a lime cordial soda. The lime soda was really great as it wasn't sweet it was pure lime. When the bacon butty came I was amazed as it was HUGE! I added a bit of ketchup and it was one of the best bacon butty's I've ever had. Proper crispy bacon and beautiful bread. The salad and quesadillas ordered by the others were also declared lovely. A real plus is the view, it's by the river where a breeze and lots of activity keep you entertained. I would recommend this place to have a nice quick lunch
3
Nice setting, short walk from MTR. I was looking forward to English Roast Beef complete with Yorkshire Pudding only to be told on a Monday it was unavailable, and neither was the Beef and Guiness Pie. I opted for the Cornish Pasty, but my word the pastry was rock hard! My companion had the cottage pie and he found that most enjoyable. Of course the big attraction was a pint of Kilkenny, and most enjoyable.too
4
A fantastic British pub on the water front. Good service, excellent views and a wide range of authentic drinks. Not my usual style to hunt a British pub when away, but it's well worth a stop.
4
This was my local for 5 years, and I return to Singapore and Penny Black at least twice a year to enjoy a cold beer and a great view on the river bank and to catch up with old friends from all over the world. Many of the staff have been there for sometime and you are treated like family on returning. The food is good pub grub and there is always sports on the TV's. The quality of service fluctuates occasionally. Handy to Raffles Place MRT, taxis at the rear or a short walk from Clarke Quay
4
We dropped into this Pub a few times whilst in Singapore as it was a great place to relax after a lot of walking and to have a pint and watch the world go by. Burgers are quite good and we thought the service was great. I had a glass with lipstick marks on it which I'd only noticed after I'd poured beer into it. The waitress kindly got me a fresh glass along with a new bottle of Tiger - apologising profusely at the same time. Excellent service I thought. Decor is very authentic British pub style - worth a visit
4
For the days when you want a good beer and something different to Stir fries, the Penny Black won't disappoint. We tried the Fish and chips (Atlantic cod) which was served with mushy peas and tartare sauce. The batter was crisp and delicious, the portion just large enough to eat in the hot and humid conditions the monsoon brings to Singapore in December. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The pub is located just on Boat Quay, the first of many other eateries dwarfed by the surrounding skyscrapers
4
A very enjoyable and good quality Christmas lunch at the Penny Black. Good service, attentive management and good food.Most pleasant afternoon
4
We ate here a few times and each time the food was lovelyPerfect for a drink and snack overlooking the riverPrices are reasonable too :)Would recommend if you want British Food
5
This is by far the closest thing to a British style pub I have found anywhere in South East Asia! The pub itself is styled to look and feel exactly like a British pub and it does! The staff are very friendly, welcoming and so helpful. The food tastes amazing and there is a great selection of local and imported beverages available. The only downside is the price however. The price is very similar to central London pub prices. However, although it is expensive, it is by far one of the nicest and pleasant meals/experiences I have had in Asia. I would highly recommend everyone try this place, just make sure you have enough money first!
4
The Penny Black is somewhere we have always avoided as we have an aversion to mock British pubs...I am afraid you can never replicate the real thing. We did succumb at last, mainly due to the refurbishments on Boat Quay, and we quite happy with the place (as long as you don't think of it as a British Pub)! We were there on a Sunday lunch time and clearly there are lot of locals as there was a fair amount of banter between them and staff. The 'pub' is definitely a hang out for ex-pat Brits and Aussies. Service was good and the Penny Black proved a good spot to sit for a while..
4
This pub has a great view over the river and city beyond. A really good place to have a beer and something to eat.We just had some snacks - chips and spicy chicken wings which were both tasty and the portion size was good
4
Called in for a few wines last night (at $128 for 2 bots chardonnay...not cheap)Thought would try them today for happy hour... $62 for bot chardonnay...not happy and neither were the staff..customer service training neede
4
Great place for a beer or several, gold snack foods and options to sit inside air con or outdoors with views of river and city. On a no traffic road so great friendly people atmospsher
5
Met some friends here for a chat. However, a rugby match was going on, so the conversation was a bit strained. With all the action going on the multiple screens the service as still prompt and friendly
3
When the sports not on, it's a nice place to meet with friends. But once the sports on, it's so loud it's impossible to have a conversation. The drinks are good (though expensive) and the food has gone downhill since they outsourced it
5
I sat here with a few friends on a Saturday afternoon after lunch, to down a few Guinness by the tap. It was pretty nice. There's seating inside as well as outside (which is the smoking area). The alcohol rates are comparable with almost all places around this place. The place has a very British pub feel to it. The collection of beers is pretty nice. They have free wi-fi. Also, it is a short walk away from the business area of One Raffles Place
3
The "Englishness" of this "English" pub in Singapore will certainly seem rather quaint to anyone who has ever lived in England. For starters, most pubs in England don't sell litre jugs of cheap Asian lager in the place of a good pint of hand-pumped ale, though I suppose in Singapore we have to make do.Decoration wise, the floor and furniture area feels very much like a Wetherspoons, but in terms of everything else it seems as if they had simply taken a mishmash of any English stereotypes and fused them together in a hilariously bad impressium that does not work at all as decoration. There is a Royal Mail postbox situated randomly in the middle of the floor, and photos of London buses and Trafalgar Square look very out of place alongside football and rugby league charts.Given the area of the city it is in, however, prices could be a lot worse. And on happy hour after a long hot walk around the Marina area, a litre jug of Tiger was definitely welcome to cool down in a moderately welcoming setting. I wouldn't recommend it per se, but you could do a lot worse
4
Visited this pub on Boat Quay ad enjoyed a snack and a beer.Option of inside our outside dining - opted for the potato skins which I thoroughly enjoyed. Chose to sit indoors as it was much cooler in the hot sun of a Singapore afternoon. The view of the river is more spectacular from the outside I guess though - especially for tourists. Would recommend this pub - quite authentic with good service and ambiance
3
Visited to watch football on Saturday afternoon, small crowd but waited 22 mins for my beer. It didn't improve. The pub itself is looking the worst for wear and must be due a refit.
4
We ordered the fish and chips which was really good. Set lunches are quite value for money too. Really nice decor and English pub feel!
5
Having lived in Singapore for more than 6 years & a Brit I found this local watering hole not only authentic but friendly & hospitable.Great location & pretty good & (for Singapore) reasonably priced tasty grub - well worth a visit. Awesome views overlooking the river close to the MRT
3
I was recommend to this place by a colleague. It is a typical English style hotel that caters for tourists. Now you would have read other reviews that said the drinks are expensive, but you need to know this is Singapore and Alcohol is expensive this is middle range pricing. The decor is fine the service is a little pushy with regards to "do you want another drink??" When you haven't even finished your drink. What would work better is if they had staff assigned to certain tables so you would not have 3 waitresses asking you if you want a drink. Really feels they are on commission. (Felt a little like a bar in Phuket pushing you to spend, but the prices do not warrant this service) nice location by the Singapore river and renovations happening to make the river view amazing!
3
Caught up for a few beers with some mates.... Was supposed to be happy hours but they only took off 2$ from the price during happy hours..which was disappointing..the staff are a bit clueless if you ask them to recommend you some snacks..not sure I'd go back there.
3
id been here before many times since i was living in singapore and thought id take a rip down memorie lane, sunday lunch was on my mind.beef was decent enough, no roast spuds,paah how could they,a fancy pants display of veg,and a gravy that tated a little tomatoey,very odd. and $9 a pint of sprite,the service was good but impersonel its was very quite in there and it seemed to have lost its edge a bi
3
Spot the Brits at this British themed local but expensive.1 Malibu & coke & 1 Speckled Hen S$271 Merlot (glass) S$15!!! But nice atmosphere & outlook of river
2
Rubbish unfriendly staff, slow service, bad food... why would you even bother!20mins to get a bill is ridiculous. Watch out for the waiter with the mohawk - totally miserable
5
You want British food & drink then come here on an evening, enjoy the Singapore sky line together with the beautiful illuminated bride and picturesque reflective illumination from the water. Great pub great ambience.
4
I was invited to join some locally based colleagues at the Penny Black pub one Friday after work recently. It was easy to find on the Boat Quay with great views over the river and the Singaporean night skyline. We sat outside which was OK even though the weather was typically hot and sticky and not really that comfortable in my opinion. However as I arrived late & my hosts were already installed I joined in and tried to keep cool by supping on the little bottles of Tiger beer which kept coming all evening. For food most of the menu seemed the type you would find in any self respecting pub in England. We chose a range of finger food like chicken wings and tangy nachos to munch on first before ordering our main course. I went for the fish & chips which were delicious. The pure white, fleshy fish was delicious. The tiny pot of hard, mushy peas could have been saved but that's only a minor point.Towards the end of the evening I moved on to a nice pint of Speckled Hen. This really is a place in a lovely setting for all those homesick expats and tourist
4
Riverside location is fantastic, with views across the river and Singapore skyline, service was friendly and given the location (and it's Singapore) the drinks are reasonably priced.
4
My wife and I stopped here for a beer or two most nights on a recent trip. The Guinness is very cold and perfectly poured as is the Tiger Beer.On our last night in Singapore we had the Fish and Chips. This was without doubt the best fried fish we have eaten in years, anywhere in the world but the chips were hidden under it, the tartare sauce tasted home-made but the Penny Black think that a thimble full of mushy peas constitutes a portion
3
Met friends here for a drink and ended up having a meal. Drinks were OK, if a little steep in price. Don't go for the food. Disappointing - not tasty at all
4
I passed this restaurant multiple times during my stay in Singapore. It was always packed with people. Finally I stopped to get dinner. The food is a bit spendy, but it was well made and tasted great. Even with a full place the staff was always available for whatever I needed
3
We went to this place last night for dinner. I wish I read the reviews below. Omg.. I ordered Fish and Chips which fish wasn't fresh and insipid. The fries that came with it was soggy and warm. Other two of group order 2 basket of chicken wings which both sent back coz it was super black and smelt burnt. They told the waitress that the bar shouldn't serve this kind of food to customers. Other ordered was potatoes wedges and chicken breast with cheese which were good. The service was decent. If I was there alone and only ordered Fish and Chips >>>> Definitely **2 stars
3
I only come here for a beer, and only during happy hour. The water front is nice, has a nice little patio on the water, and i like having an old speckled hen on tap, a nice place to relax at boat quay
3
We stopped here for a bite to eat and a drink to escape the heat and humidity. I chose here as I used to drink in a pub called The Penny Black in London when I lived there. The pub itself was nice and it wasn't very crowded when we were there but we found it to be very expensive, even for Singapore. We had Tiger beers, which were $13 each, and the girls had coke from the pump which were a staggering $5.50 each. The food was very average too
1
Despite its name as an English pub, the Fish & Chips served was the worst I've ever taken. At almost $18 a plate , the potato fries which were warm and not hot, did not have the slightest hint of salty flavoring. The Fish was equally bland and tasteless with the dough chaffing up more than the fish meat itself. A colleague who took the ham sandwich lunch of the day complained about the food as being forgettable. Maybe this place is good as a watering hole for people to unwind after a hard days work but to have your pint with a meal, you're better off elsewhere !!
4
I was looking for a place to kick back and have a nice Guiness on tap that was along the Singapore Riverwalk. This place fills up after work with folks from the local banks and professional offices. Good service and good beer. The food looked OK, but based on the locals its the place to meet friends and have a brew after work. It was kind of loud, but good fun watching the rugby on TV and working up an appetite for supper
3
Stopped by for a quick lunch over the weekend food was nothing to write home about nor was the price of the beer, second time I've been here in a year on my Singapore visits, Staff were friendly and polite, The bar does look good for watching sports on the TV and would be great for an afternoon or evening of beer, fun with mate
5
Visited here over the Chinese new year and so was very busy.Nevertheless the service was very good. Good selection of food to choice from. The meal was very enjoyable, had the beef whilst others had lamb chops, The only complaint I had was the fact that it was not very hot and I personally do like my food to arrive hot, however given they were so busy I expect it was standing for a little while. Deserts were good too, had the chocolate desert and this was great although with so much chocolate was hard to finish.I would definately return to this restaurant. They have outside eating and drinking, mostly I think people drink outside as it is at Boat Quay. Plenty of atmosphere,
3
as the name suggests, it is the Singaporean version of a British pub. There are quite a few beers to choose from, the food is good pub style. Spicy chicken wings are great.
3
Sat next to the river so scenery was nice. Ordered tika masala and the roast beef. Both were adequate but would not order again. Probably a good place to sit back and chill with a beverage or 2
3
Great place for a beer/glass of wine with friends, business associates. Nothing special in either the wines, service of food but pleasant enough. They are famously known in Singapore for being the pub that shows Newcastle United games
4
There is nothing like a great pub for those lazy afternoons, the beers are cold and there is a wide range, the service is excellent and quick even in the pouring rain. If you are looking for a beer on the way in or on the way out this is the pub for you. Enjoy
3
I came here to meet a friend from Bali. Found a table outside quite close to the river. We ordered drinks straight away, however the drinks took around 15-20mins to come. The bar inside wasn't very busy, so don't understand why it took so long.Great location though
3
The place is nice. In fact I've used to go there even in the early 90s.Today, however, their selection of ales is non-existent, which is normally a hallmark of an English Pub.To the very least, any of the Fullers, Shepheard Neame, Boddington or Theakstones should be represented
4
Called here a few times for drinks and once for food . It does get very busy on a lunch time with office workers but the service was good ..The good thing was the price displayed was the price paid no added tax or service charge.The food was enjoyable and reasonably priced .Only downside was the toilets they were clean but they did stink 
3
Its not a bad Pub, its lively, food is ok, service is ok, but that's it really. Toilets are shocking. I suggest go next door to Harry's much better form all aspects
4
Good small selection of beers on tap and pub grub. Gets busy in the evenings with the Raffles Place folks and beyond. Prices are pretty standard, food quality is generally reliable and good.
5
Location is great, service is wonderful! I really like the traditional woody feel of the decor and their enthusiasm for sports (especially football).To the manager, I would recommend a few changes to make the experience much more perfect. I recommend changing the black tables and chairs on the deck as tables are sticky. I recommend having more events such as comedy clubs are bands. I recommend investing in better quality napkins and a greater selection of whiskeys. Finally, consider opening the upstairs section permanently as it creates much more pleasurable ambience. Consider some table cloths
4
Great place for a drink on Boat Quay, not too expensive on happy hour , tiger , Kilkenny , speckled hen. Pleasant service , bar snacks available till late,
4
Nice English themed pub on the quayside with good views on the river. Drinks are average costs and the food is good. Service is good and you get a mixture of English, Ozzy and Irish visitors.
5
Â£7.50 for a pint of Tiger (where it is made) as opposed to Â£4.20 in Hertfordshire! Still cheaper than Oslo though and cheaper than many places in Singapore. Nice pub. Much quicker to go to the bar and get served than wait to be served at your table. Very nice location
3
This is basically a traditional English Pub â€“ in fact it is a traditional Victorian English pub (which makes me wander if it was around in the colonial days â€“ I can't say really, and there wasn't anything that said otherwise). This was quite a nice place, though certainly not my favourite place (I've never been a fan of English pubs outside of England). Still, it was quite a nice place to sit in the evening, especially outside by the river bank watching the boats make their way up and down the waterway. If there is once thing that does set this place out and it is certainly its location. Hey, if you like English football you can even catch a game here
4
Reasonable food and drinks at reasonable prices (compared to other establishments in Singapore). The location is great at Boat Quay where you can sit and watch either the river boats or people watch. very relaxing spot and well worth a visit
2
Came here for a late drink to cool down and enjoy the end of the eve. We ordered some snacks which were not terribly nice - specifically the white bait - perhaps that ws lost in translation. There was a great selection of beer for Singapore but it was quite expensively priced. The location was outstanding offering a great view of the boat quay. All in all i just didn't feel like this place offered good value for mone
3
We went here for a drink one evening on the recommendation of a friend from home who described it as "peaceful and relaxing". He must go in the middle of the night when everyone else has gone to bed because we went on a weekday night and it was heaving!We weren't keen to eat here because it really is like being back in Britain and that just wasn't what we were after on this occasion - good old British favourites on the menu like bangers and mash, fish and chips etc. There seem to be quite a large expat contingent in the night we were there too so many people obviously do enjoy the ambiance.We did have a couple of drinks, my husband had a Tiger Beer and I had a Mai Tai cocktail but we thought it was quite expensive. We left after that- the one thing you're not short of on the Quays is somewhere to eat and drink! 
4
I recently spent six weeks in Singapore on a business trip and was delighted to come across this restaurant and to discover that it serves a traditional Sunday Roast, which is also available throughout the week. However, on Sundays there is the choice of a special two or three course menu. The food is very good, though the drinks are pricey, even at happy hour prices. The service is excellent and the venue offers a certain home-from-home feeling for ex-pats in Singapore with excellent views across Boat Quay

had dinner and drinks here during a 2d1n staycation at grand park city hall hotel. i thought $12 for chilli crab dip + wedges was just expensive bar food, but it ended up being a pretty large serving that my partner and i was too full to finish.the live band dedicated a song to us and also performed a request from us. the atmosphere was lively, staff were polite. music was pretty loud however, made conversations a little hard indoors.spent $90 for some alright fish and chips, great chilli crab dip + wedges (+ leftovers), nice glass of red wine, weak pina colada, yummy white russian and jamesons on too many rock

Owned by the same company that operates Muddy Murphy's, the Penny Black is a nice English style pub on Boat Quay.It is clean, the staff are efficient and there is a good selection of well kept draught beers.If you are in the area, pop in for a crisp pint
4
I do not believe that in a city of such great and varied food we ate at a English pub type restaurant but at the time that is what we felt like. And it was actually quite good. I had a hamburger and my wife had a mango salad. And the beer was cold which in Singapore is very important. Good service and overlooking the Singapore river at boat quay the atmosphere is nice
4
happening place...great place to hangout... good service manned by pinoys...was surprised that it was run like a food stall : pay immediately after you get the food and drinks...prices bit steep but hey, what did you expect...burger was okay not too fussy...our event was on the second floor which was drabby and dark...but it's always the company that saved the day or evening in this case...will retur

Anyone who regularly visits Singapore will know the Penny Black, its been there for as long as Singapore has. It really has the best English Pub atmosphere and beer. My colleague and I decided to have a chat over a few cold beers and the beer of choice was Old Speckled Hen. Perfect.Over the years I have eaten at the Penny Black more times than I care to remember and have never had any complaints about the food. Its always served fresh and hot. Even in the busiest times of the year and the day the service is great and the food and beers arrive very quickly.sit inside on a hot day, outside the rest of the time and watch the world go by

British themed pub in a great location, right on the water. Not the cheapest or best for food but if you can put up with that its really not bad. We went there a few time during our visit and were with locals who loved the place. Service is however very variable and we pretty much served ourselves one evening as the staff couldn't be bothered.Worth a visit, if you get the right night/staff its a great place to party
1
Location: Great, might be a good spot to have a beer afterwork.Service: chaotic.. when they bring you the food they place the bill the next second, asking you to pay straight instead of enjoying your meal.. Prices for drinks heavy. Glas of Coke Light 7dollars nett. all prices are quoted nett, which I like actually.Food: Burger didn't look good, salat was ok, roastbeef dissappointed. pub food for around 15dollars, ok price.Place needs some organized service..several guests had to ask again for their orders.
5
We enjoyed this eatery so much that we ate there three of our four nights in Singapore. The food and decor were British and provided good value for money. Prices were nett, so we knew exactly what to expect. Service was friendly and relaxed. The food was hearty. The variety enabled one of our party to eat gluten-free meals and still have variety. The proximity to the Singapore river and the other foodstalls added to the atmosphere, which was oriental in spite of the British influence. We chose to eat indoors, but could have easily eaten outside with a view of the river
4
We arrived at Boat Quay looking for another eating place , we asked direction from a staff member at Penny Black and he said it was around the back ,wanting to eat near the water we asked for a table , what a delight ,great staff great spot and particularly great food . We both had the tenderloin steak ,it was beautiful and cooked to perfection . We would highly recommend Penny Black 
5
Great place on Boat Quay for hanging out with a beer and watching the world go by. Constantly busy and the staff are efficiently running around with food and drink orders. The Guinness is great and I can thoroughly recommend the steak and fried egg sandwich followed the warm chocolate pudding. I got looked after really well. The staff are really polite and they even pop round to tell you that happy hour is finishing soon so that you can get another round in before the price increase. It's a great slice of London in Singapore. Enjoy
5
Had a meal and drink there while on holiday we had the roast dinner beef and mashed pots and Yorkshire pudding we both loved it meal was excellent and price $18 was good for area,would highly recommend if in Singapore our seat was on water , which was nice to see the boats go by all alight for the night ,waiters were a little slow but we could see they were busy so that's fine,would come again
2
We recently visited this place for lunch.Its a nice setting by the river and is the first pub/resturant in the huge street of 50 or so bars/resturants in boat quay.The design is a British pub style with outdoor seating by the river.The menu also follows the same theme with all the British favourites.It wasnt busy the day we ate the service was ok but the food wasnt good at all...in fact my fish and chips was very poor indeed. frozen fish and dry chips yuk!!Drinks were quite expensive for a pub also.We got the feeling that this was a British style pub run by locals NOT ex pats
4
Nice looking pub right on the river, was rammed when I got there (outside) but I had been taking in the sight so just rest stop and a beer inside was enough. Obviously loads of expats but that's the point right, i.e. traditional.
5
We visited this pub as an old favourite of my wife. The beer was good and we enjoyed a quiet half hour of people watching and nattering. The location is great and the booze list extensive.
3
Stopped in here for drinks by the water. Great location and choice of drinks. Very pricey to say the least so we only had one.
4
This place was my localI loved it here and would bring visitors, guests and friends here all the timeI'm a big fan of Guinness and its hard to find a place that pours it well on this island - so the Penny Black is a treatHowever, when I used to come here, the staff were primarily Filipino and so were smiling, friendly, attentive and extremely hard working - oh how the service has changed since they had to hire more localsThe night we were there - it was quiet as it was already almost 10pm....but you had one barman half asleep with his head down on the bar and the one 'serving' waiter was more interested in smoking a cigarette than serving tablesAnother group beside us told us his service was awful all nightIt's a massive shame as like I said I love this placeIt's why i still give it a high rating, because of the memoriesI just hope the management reads this review and takes note - don't let it slide

I have been a fan of penny black for years and have come often for a meals and drinks. I came with relatives from UK who were visiting. .. not impressed.It has perhaps been a few months since my last visit but this time was a sunday .. allbeit before xmas .. but .. that should not be an excuse.Had a cider which tasted watered down.  The menu is very limited now at lunch at least and the standard of food dropped significantly. My gammon was paper thin pork drowned in cold apple sauce but the meat was cold anyway so didnt affect the temp.With regret until the menu and or chef is changed the slide in quality i fear will continue. This will be a shame .. great location, historically was fabulous but sadly disappointing.Staff were attentive and pleasant but obviously disinterested
5
It was a romantic night with my boyfriend.I'm currently in europe and trying burgers here and there, but the burger in the Penny black bits elsewhere! Can't forget the burger there!!I don't remember the exact name of the burger cuz it was almost 6 month ago.I came to leave comments because it was so much impressive one.I would visit you again when I come to Singapore!
1
Another fellow review remarked that "Penny Black is basically an ex-pat pub..." However I did not realise it to mean that people of colour are unwelcome. All 3 waiters who served us made it clear that we were not welcome there (I'm Singaporean of ethnic Indian Origin) ... So if you want some place that practices racism, that's the right place to go
4
Penny Black is basically an ex-pat pub on Boat Quay in Singapore. The food is pretty basic but it is a great place to go to watch sports with like-minded individuals and to have a chat over a beer or a few glasses of wine
4
I went with new friends to Penny Black. I can say it was a perfect night out. The place was full of activities and people chattering around you. In this case, it make the place feel so alive. The draughts were awesome and we all agreed that we love the smell of the woody thing that you definetly find in a English bar.. Well done..
4
We popped in here for lunch and were impressed by its location ( overlooking the singapore river ) at the end of the boat quay. The menu is impressive with lots of traditional english favourites, we had the full english and the octoberfest pork knuckle which were both excellent. Well worth a visit..
4
A wide selection of British pub food served alongside the Singapore river. A bit pricey, but all restaurants on Boat quay are, and in fact Penny Black compares favourably with it's neighbours.
Fish and chips, beef and ale pie, roast beef - all available.
5
Like home from home,good traditional English pub , good service good food ( had the seafood selection ) at very reasonable prices with nice view of the river while eating.
3
Nice place to sit down after work with friends..lots of choice for drinks better to order from bottle than a menu ;)
4
Great location, service can be a little hit and miss.Great terrace by the water and massive pub inside.Food is OK... Keep it simple here, though the "bacon butty" (even though it's not a butty its a roll) is a great hangover sponge.Regular spot for me to meet people before heading out
4
Sister pub to Muddy Murphy's, it shares the same menu, but not as good in my opinion. Perfect location for our gate to F1 or to the rest of Boat Quay, or a short walk to Clarke. If you want a little bit of home, and want to escape the heat and bustle this is not a bad spot. Lots of other traditional local restaurants close by if you just want to pop into the pub for a drink. In pub terms it's pretty good, service good, food is good, stay away from the Sunday Lunch it's terrible, but everything else is ok
4
If you're like this reviewer, you'll flee the pub's steamy riverside terrace for the air conditioning inside. The beer's cold and unlike a real pub you get service at your table. Only odd thing was that my ham, cheese and tomato toasted sandwich had the melted cheese on the outside, making it a bit unwieldy. But a good place to flee the heat
3
Weekend roast is served on Saturday and Sunday. 2 courses $20. Roast beef is good, served with burnt Yorkshire. Mashed potatoes?! Never have Sunday roast served with mash.Chef special roast is fish. Very nicely grilled. Shame flooded with cheese gravy all over it. Do ask separate gravy. Chocolates cake is tasty.We have been told they served the best English breakfast here, after this meal, don't think will try English breakfast at all
3
Location is great,The lady serving yesterday was slow, rude and when she did come over she said yes please and when I gave her my order for drinks turned to another customer, asked what he wanted ignored me then served him and then proceeded to finally get my drinks, had to wait 15 minutes to be served by her even though it wasn't that busy.The waiting staff were excellent the food portions weren't the largest I have ever seen or the quality wasn't the greatest either but that may have been the dishes we ordered, the plus side being they don't add a service charge which is rare and reasonably priced compared to a lot of places in Singapore.Ok for a drink if you don't get the same member of bar staff but certainly won't eat there again
3
Went here to watch a football game. The view is very nice as it sits next to the river and you have a beautiful picturesque scene of The Fullerton Hotel. Ordered the Beef Burger - just about average but filled the stomach which is what I really wanted
2
We've just had lunch here at this pub, the location is lovely al fresco riverside with a fresh warm breeze but that's where it stops. I had the chicken mango salad, tough rubbery chicken, salad was a combo of mixed limp over dressed lettuce not crunchy at all, the mango was good. My husband had the burger with chips, not too bad but cold arriving. The salt didn't work, slow wait for the mustard and absolutely no service in spite of the place being emptish....The positives are that the views are nice along the riverside, you can watch the boats and enjoy the breeze on a hot sunny Singaporean day. Don't bother coming here though, go next door! The meals look much better
5
I had the cottage pie just because I wanted to see how it would taste in Asia.
It was incredible just as good or better than what I have had in the UK.
Great potatoes and flavored meat.
Just be careful beers are expensive!!!
3
A family with 2 'tweens on a Sunday for early evening meal. Service could use improvement. Water was never refilled; waiter never came back to check on us after dropping off our orders. I guess if you are not a group out for beer drinking you are not going to get 2nd check. Place was not crowded. Heard that on weekdays, happy hour is busy. Meal size was not a pub offering for the price; quality of product is nothing to rave about. Lovely view. Been there, done that..
2
I went there cos of the nice location at the river for lunch on a Sunday. The staff is not very friendly and seemed not well trained. I choosed from the menu of the day a salmon with mashed potatos.The dish looked and tasted like it was prepared some hours before and just heated in the microwave oven. The fish was dry and not fresh. The beer was some of the most expensive ones I drunk in my life
4
Just popped in here for a drink and a bite to eat before departing Singapore. Can't honestly remember what I ate or drank because it was over 2 weeks ago. The menu was varied.It is in a nice setting in Boat Quay. It is nice and relaxing watching what is going on on the river as you sip your drink.The only concern was the time they took to return with my credit card but up till now there have been no unauthorised deductions
4
I went to Boat Quay a few days before Christmas. I found Penny Black and went in for some ale. I had some Old Speckled Hen which was very nice. I was early so it wasn't too crowded but the ambiance is very nice, lovely traditional setting and decor.This is a great place to have a couple of drinks and then go on for dinner or maybe a drink or two elsewhere to end the evening
3
We go to PB fairly regularly at lunchtimes. We go because of the location, the ambience and it's actually got decent tap beer which is not always that common in Singapore. However.......One of the most annoying things is that the place is never set up outside when you arrive and there is always half an hour of scraping chairs and arranging tables which droves you potty along with the endless vehicle deliveries.Please could you do this instead in the mornings!
2
I ate here as I wanted some place chilled after a two day trip to Singapore before getting on a 14 hr flight.Location fantastic beer cold and it was happy hour. It was too humid to eat the majority of their menu so had what is usually a croque monsieur and was cold with the saltiest fries I have ever had~and I use to work at a golden arch in high school. But the service ia terrible. I would have sent the food back if anyone had come back my way. Paying was a nightmare they faked my PIN number on my card so it was refused. I had to call the bank use another card while finding out it was their fault. So no tip except AVOI
4
I took my wife and young daughter for a Monday lunch time. I had a great "toad in the hole" (although the toads weren't in the pudding...I thought that was the point?) while my wife managed to demolish another pork knuckle and the daughter had "the best fish and chips ever!" Service was prompt, the Kilkennies was great and the cider very refreshing. A bit dark and gloomy but outside dining is available. A very enjoyable lunch
4
Been twice, and both times had a good pint of Kilkenny and a Guiness (far better than the dire offerings down the road at Charlies, stick to bottles if you go there). First time in Penny Black I had a Parmo..... a famous dish if you are from, or have ever spent time in Teesside UK. Gotta say my mate does a better one, but hey not bad considering this is the other side of the world. In a group of 9 we all ordered food albeit at differing times, one of the guys sat and waited and waited for a Tandoori Chicken dish that never arrived, eventually told it was no longer available..... poor service there, even worse for Dave as he was starving, or so he claimed (he has plenty padding so no harm done). A week later my wife and I returned with other friends and had the Sunday roast on a Saturday evening...... very good indeed, but only 1 yorkshire pud :( EVERY Sunday roast comes with at least 2 (My mam used to have loads on the go :) ). Anyway, we again had a good evening, Footy was on the TV's, atmosphere was good in the place, loud n slightly rowdy...... We finished off another good evening. Penny Black all in all I reckon one of the good chain operated bars, go there if this is your sort of thing..... but ask for 2 Yorkshires ;
5
Came here for the sunday roast at lunch time and wasnt dissapointed ! I had raost beef and hubby had the lamb both were delicious ! Only thing we can say it would have been nice to have proper roast potatoes but otherwise we really enjoyed it ! Would recommend for sure
4
Great selection of beer - you can't go wrong with Kilkenny on tap. Food wasn't too bad. Great ambiance if you're into pubs and pub grub. Outdoor seating also available
5
A real traditional replica of an English Pub. The food is excellent and the Sunday roast is a must. Alfresco dining by the river makes it a lovely spot for a pint.
3
I had a Cornish pasty and found it to be very wet and more like a pie and the menu was lacking in good British desserts. The service was ok but a bit slow. The nice thing was being by the water and the prices were reasonable for Singapor
2
Wanted to enjoy a typical Sunday lunch in a pub with my family. Ordered fish n chips. Hubby & i sent both back as it was tasteless & the fish was wet & soggy like it had been defrosted. Batter was nice. Stingy on the chips & mushy peas. I ordered the chicken masala, I sent it back, the sauce had a film on it (been sitting under the lights too long?),& lukewarm. Hubby ordered the beef & ale pie. Looked great, I tried it. Beef had loads of fat on it, spat it into serviette & it was less than lukewarm. My kids had bacon sarnies, swimming in fat, dry hard bread. Generous on the chips. I quit there, eating my lunch elsewhere this afternoon. Hubby ordered rhubarb & crumble, looked good, was lukewarm & flavourless. Kids ordered chocolate pudding with ice-cream; presentation was great, way too runny. Was like choc liquid you pour over ice-cream. No word of apology by waitress's. I asked to speak to the manager who apologised saying she'd have a word with the chef (Chinese Singaporean). I'm hungry & it's now 4.15pm. Need to eat
4
The menu had all the pub classics you would come to expect, and from what we ordered it seems like its pretty well executed. Prices are typical for Singapore (which means high of course). The ambiance wasn't exceptionally "pubby" but we sat outside, so that's to be expected. I left feeling content and I would go back
3
What can I say, after looking at the reviews for this I was so looking forward to visiting somewhere that was home from home. The pub interior/ exterior was great and it was like being back in a pub in the uk. The most disappointing part was the highly priced food. We ordered a steak/chips, gammon, nachos, steak n ale pie and 6 drinks came to $151.00. The weight of the steak was not as described, just plonked on the plate with chips.The gammon was thinly cut and tasted of apple juice, with a tablespoon of mash,The meat pie, the sauce tasted very strange I couldn't put my finger on it. The crust of the pie was very undercooked, I counted 3 tiny pieces of meat, 3 pieces of celery and carrots just top with gravy. This had a spoon of mash and a tiny sauce pot of beans.My child left his dinner of nachos, this is meant to be chilli as we all know,but in this instance was mince beef with a curry flavour sprinkled with cheese not covering the nacho's. this was extremely spicy. I had to purchase another meal elsewhere for him after we left.On observation the english locals don't seem eat there, some snacked on wedges which to me tells a story. I'd recommend this place to have a drink which is Ã¢â€šÂ¬12 a pop, but certainly not for eating, you will be very disappointed.
4
Well what a surpirse this was, a "pub" in Singapore that is the hang out for all geordies living on the island, good location, drinks as ever in Singapore where not cheap so visit at happy hour, gets a bit busy with the city crowd at times but dont let this put you off.
3
This place is just like the majority of restaurants and bars around Boat Quay (see my review). It's very average. Service is not good nor not bad, the menu is mediocre, the food is edible but does not invite you to come back. Luckily prices are also average so you don't pay too much and can leave the place with a very full belly (including a pint of beer) and still have some money in your pocket. I paid SGD 71.- for a full English breakfast (for lunch!), roast beef with mash, 3 soft drinks, 2 coffee and a pint of Guiness. And including a 10-dollar dessert! The interior is OK, although the toilets are pretty bad. Outside though, you can sit in an excellent spot at the water with a great view over the old colonial waterfront. I can imagine that on a night out with drinkers from the UK, you'll have a great time here
4
Right on Boat Quay, the Penny Black looks just like the older-style pubs in England. Lots of varnished wood, and embossed wallpaper that nobody's used in their house since probably before I was born (and that's a while ago!). It looks very authentic, just like my local place in Norwich many years ago.Came here for something traditionally British (I'm from the UK but live in Japan) and wasn't disappointed. There is a small bar menu (which was the first thing I saw inside and was slightly disappointed), but when I saw the larger food menu it was a relief. All of the usual staples like cottage pie, fish and chips, nachos etc. are on the menu. In the end I had toad-in-the hole which was excellent, although it was difficult to choose between it and the Eggs Benedict (not a UK speciality but a personal favourite).It's not so cheap, but I went on a Sunday evening and pints of Tiger were $12 as it was Happy Hour. Food is generally in the S$15-18 range for main courses.There's a taxi rank if you exit to the right and go back to the main road, and it wasn't difficult to find a taxi even after a few pints. Good view of the Fullerton Hotel from out front, too, and lots of restaurants on the same street if you only want a beer. TV had soccer on, but wasn't too loud
1
After taking a few work colleagues we settled to what hoped to be a present evening of food and light refreshments. How wrong could I have been, the service is worse than the normal Singapore standard. The food arrived with no knives / forks etc... had to ask, taking 10 minutes , then another 10 minutes for salt / Pepper and sauce. The food was cold and very over cooked. After leaving I had the pleasure of food poisoning and spent the night vomiting with severe Diarrhoeal - requiring my to go to the hospital to receive plasma - I feel so sick.This place have returned the worst experience with a nasty after affect..
4
Good venue for a few beers, watch out for the expats! great pub food selection and good place to chill out after work. if it is full pop[ next door to Harrys....same same but different!
4
I keep going back there because the atmosphere is good, it's less 'bling' than most along the quay, the price is fair considering its Singapore & the table service is ok too.
In summary, I'd say its a good meeting place, casual & relaxed.
5
This place is a real taste of England - the interior is frumpy in a cozy pub-like way and the menu is pure English comfort food. Good beer selection and some of the best fish and chips in Singapore.
3
The location is probably one of the better things the Penny Black has going for itself. Right at the start (or end?) of Boat Quay, it's a great location to sit outside on a lazy afternoon with a pint. I wish they had a larger beer selection but overall it's a good place. I also had a salad there, which was good. Haven't tried any other food but from what I could tell the other patrons were eating a variety of the foods. A couple patrons were just there for the drinks. I went in December, in the mid-afternoon
3
I have seen other reviews and all commented on how pricey this place is...well D'uh...it is on Boat Quay.Nevertheless, I have been dying for a nice pint of ale ever since leaving London and from what I have seen having walked up and down Boat Quay as well as other pubs/bars around Orchard and Marina Bay (will have to see if there is anything on Dempsey Village next), this is the only one that serves ales.For readers who are not familiar with a good ol's english pub, no self respecting english pub can call itself a pub if it doesnt serve ale. Well at the least, the Penny Black does, albeit only the Old Speckled Hen. It certainly isnt London Pride but its still a decent pint. Please note this is Singapore so the price of a pint during happy hour was about S$12.5 or GBP7. I did not hang around to check what regular prices are and I rather not know.Food: We had a basket sharer - mini fish and chips, lots of chips, onion rings, sausages, chicken wings...decent amount for 2 to share for S$35. Service: Staff do not know what a true english pub is meant to be like.At least they warn us when happy hour is ending.Environment: Not quite pub like atmosphere but not because there were no yobs or chavs around. Just rather quiet and it was Friday evening.I would go back only because I still cant find ales anywhere else
1
Popped in here for a coke whilst wandering around Boat quay. Got presented the bill and was truly astonished at the price. $7.50 for a coke - is this place for real. I had no other option, but to pay; but I certainly won't be going back. Other than the price, the place looked ok
4
Had a quick beer at the Penny Black last week and really liked the vibe of the place. Felt a lot like the pubs I hung out at in Surry when I visited last year. Nice friendly bar staff and a great location down by the river
4
The Penny Black pub in Singapore is a pleasant British-style hostelry at Boat Quay. Its terrace overlooks the sedately flowing waters of the Singapore River. The pub has a view of Sir Frances Raffles who first laid foot on the opposite bank of the Singapore River, on what was then the island of Singapura or Lion Island.The pub itself is reminiscent of British pubs long gone. An oak bar with hand-pulled beer pumps delivering a range of beers familiar from blighty; John Smithâ€™s, Boddingtonsâ€™s, Guinness. Kronenborg and the like.Sunday lunches at the Penny Black are a real taste of home with a buffet fare of roast beef, pork and lamb with all the extras; crispy yet fluffy roast potatoes and parsnips, sprouts, carrots, boiled and roast potatoes covered with a stream of dark brown meaty gravy. Follow the main with an apple crumble and custard. Food just like mother used to make.The pub is directly opposite the erstwhile Singapore GPO, this Palladian style building, which opened in 1926 is now a five star luxury hotel: The Fullerton
4
We stopped in this restaurant for lunch and throughloy enjoyed the food, but were a bit taken aback by the prices. An ice tea is $7.50 and just a soda water will run you $4.50. I got two sides-- the buttered corn and carrots and cheesy potatoes with onions. Both were delicious but expensive. My boyfriend got a ham cheese which was a generous portion and served with french fries. There's something for everybody on the menu, but unless you order sides and no drinks--be prepared for a large bill
3
Ate there Sunday lunchtime as had walked past it previously and knew it did pub food. Had awful hangover and desperately wanted a bacon sandwich and lo and behold I was able to get one! Huge sandwich, good bread and stuff full of bacon and good chips with it. Service quick, although as it was public holiday there were only couple of people sitting outside - there is a deck on the river to sit at if you don't want to sit inside - but it was fine. Says what it is on the box. Would go again for pub food
