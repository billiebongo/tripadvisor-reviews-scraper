We noticed that this restaurant was full of people who appeared to be locals so we thought we'd get a good dinner here. We ordered a variety of entrees but none of the dishes were noteworthy. Very average tasting food.

We went with friends on a weekday evening. Sadly the restaurant was not very busy but I am told that lunchtimes are a different propostion. The staff were very friendly and welcoming and we were able to select a suitable table. Our hosts would have preferred a round table but I imagine they take up more space and for the lunch serving the maximum amount of customers need to be fitted in. The food was very good and tasty. Nothing extraordinary or memorable but certainly nothing to complain about. It seems the shopping centre where the restaurant is based might be having some renovations. When it is all complete I would expect the restaurant to be much busier. If the renovations include more eating places they may have to up their game a little to attract the customers. If you are in the vicinity try it but don't bother making special journey!!!!

Came here on a weekend for sure dim sum lunch. Unlike weekdays, weekend is packed with people. What I love:- wide variety of dim sum as well as cantonese food. Dim sum only for lunch though. A few creative dim sum to contend with.- Great dining ambience. Fancy yet comfortable. Large dining area. Just right beside the roof garden. - good for family and even business lunch- not too packed unlike most Chinese restaurants. Very decent distance between tables. Wheelchair friendly too. Lift to carpark just right beside.Food: 8/10 (good variety and quality)Ambience: 8/10 Service: 7/10 (weekend crowd)Value: 7/10 (30% discount on dim sum for now

Didn't go there with much expectation judging by the barren lunch crowd. The appearance had betrayed us. We had soup and peking duck and I'm deeply impressed with everything on our table. The duck's skin was roasted very crispy and its meat was tender, which was a revered combination not easy to find. The soup was well brewed with authentic ingredients, without relying on strong seasonings. I can see that the menu contains many other worthy dishes which I hope to return amd try.

The term "A La Carte Buffet" may be oxymoronic, but it describes the concept accurately--once you know how it's done. Essentially, this is an all-you-can-eat restaurant, but instead of getting pre-cooked dishes from a buffet table, you order your food from a buffet menu. You can order as many dishes and as many times (with a few exceptions) as your stomach allows. Your table must have a minimum of 3 people to do the buffet.If you think the dishes on the menu are the cheap stuff that nobody wants, think again. The "Premium Items", which each person can only order one time, give you a choice between Mini Buddha Jump Over the Wall (a rick stock of a soup with abalone--yes, abalone) and Minced Garlic Boston Lobster. Even though I love garlic and lobster, I couldn't 't resist trying a dish with a jumping mini Buddha in its name. And jump it did--from the bowl to my belly.The "Superior Items" is served once for the entire table. You have a choice between Singapore Chili Crab and White Pepper Crab. We chose the Singapore Chili Crab. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough crabs for the ten of us; we almost couldn't finish it all there were so many crabs for everyone. That chili sauce--it was delicious! If it weren't embarrassing, we would drink the sauce by the spoonful and lick the platter clean. The rest of the items in the menu can be ordered as many times as you wish. They come in either small (for 3 people) or medium portion. I didn't ask how many people the medium portion could serve since I wanted to try as many dishes as possible. In addition to the Premium and Superior items, for Round 1 we ordered about 15 small dishes for our table of 10 people: duck, sea cucumber, prawns, wagyu beef--you get the idea. They were all delicious. There were other items in the menu that we wanted, but we thought we'd leave it for Round 2. Nobody had enough space in their belly after round 1.At $42 ($22 for children), this is one of the best value I have gotten in Singapore. And somebody had to pry me loose from my chair

As recommended by LadyIronChef, we went to their Marina Square outlet for A La Carte buffet dinner. We ordered a variety of entrees and side dishes, most of them just average taste only, some of the them are salty, and the food served was cold.. We would not recommend to friends

Even if you are not staying in the Marina Bay area, this restaurant is a must. The buffet is not the usual pick from a number of heated trays, instead you are given a clip board with an extensive list of dishes (both small and large) which you choose and can have as many as you can eat. It is an a la carte buffet with a catch, there are 2 dishes that you have to have - half a lobster and chilli crab, apart from that the choices are yours. It is the best value meal I have come across, it paid for itself with the lobster and chilli crab alone. Service is friendly and the food is fresh and tasty. Don't leave Singapore without trying. I know I will be back to the Dragon Bowl on my next visit to Singapore

Nice restaurant in one of the big malls close to Pan Pacific Marina Bay. Good decor. Attentive service. Extensive menu. Pork belly chef's way was great. I had the "small" serve- it was massive. My husband is vegetarian. Good choices for vegetarians on the menu. He had the " medium" size serve and it was so large it was almost embarrassing when it was brought out. Medium range prices- certainly not "cheap", but the food was yummy

Had dim sum Lunch on a Sunday at the Marina Square outlet. It wasn't crowded, service was good and prices reasonable considering the location. Had 9 dishes for $68, and only liked 4 dishes - the deep fried silver bait, glutinous rice with chicken, char siew bun and pan fried bean curd skin.

Around 5 minute-walk from MRT Lavendor station, we can take good chinese foods
at reasonable expenses. Shop is clean and service is excellrnt.
It is worth visiting this restaurant.

Disappointing dining experience at its Aperia outlet which serves mediocre food unbefitting of the restaurant prices charged.

I visited this new place at Marina Square and was very impressed by their variety of tim sum.
Nice ambience and tasty dim sum. Plus live chinese music.
Very good service.
Will be back for more!

Low grade Chinese tea was serve with dim sum.
Can't comment much on food as the pot of tea had spoiled the whole meal

Have never visited this place.
Service was good but most importantly food was very yummy authentic Cantonese cuisine.
Will come by again in the day to try their dim sum with family.

This place is run by the ex-chefs of Shangri -la hotel. It's not very well known but the food is truly decent and reasonably priced. They have dim sum on Sunday at aperia mall. Highly recommend the Peking duck set which comes with wrap , a soup , duck and a noodle/rice with duck meat. Extremely value for money !!!

Dragon Bowl serves very nice Shark's Double Boiled Soup with Chicken, Stir Fried Veggies, Meat, Tofu, Noodles & Beef Fried Rice etc. We visited their Kallang's outlet thrice and Greenwich's outlet once, both gave great customer service. The food tasted great. Price wise is restaurant's standards. Would recommend their food to anyone who hasn't been there yet

This is our first visit to a This restaurant at Marina Square. The atmosphere seems posh with nice lightings, classy chairs and dinning setting.Ordering of food is done via iPad and the staff will come over to render help with ordering and recommendations on their specialities.1) Steam Soon Hock Fish - steam to perfection with soy sauce, fish is very fresh. Son love the taste of the sauce so much that he ate 3 bowls of rice. 2) Kurobuta pork chop - This dish is rather sweet as it's coated with honey, meat is very tender and juicy. 3) soup of the day - spare ribs with corn and carrot. The spare ribs are boiled till very soft and the soup taste sweet. A very tasty soup to soothe your soul.4) deep fried prawn in pumpkin sauce - when the dish came, I thought it's deep fried prawn with salted egg yolk (look like it). The prawn was big and with the sweetness of the pumpkin, I really enjoyed this dish!5) Braised Seasonal Vegetables with Sliced Bai Ling Mushroom & Shredded Conpoy - so so onlyNext, we shall try their day time Tim sum. ;

We went for the weekday set for 4 at $68++ that came with a soup, seafood ( a steamed fish in our case) soy chicken and jellyfish and a choice of 3 dishes (from a list of 8). The beef with spring onion was wonderful! Highly recommended

This is a review of the restaurant's outlet at Marina Square. I chanced upon this Cantonese restaurant while looking for a place to have dinner. Tucked at a corner, the restaurant was relatively empty with only a few occupied tables despite it being a public holiday. However, we did like the fact that it was quiet. As we were told that the chef had originally worked at Shangri la Hotel, we had quite a high expectation of the food quality.Thankfully, it did not disappoint. I ordered stir-fried Asparagus with XO sauce $12 (small), Braised Sliced Cod Fish with toufu $22 (small), Stir-Fried Tenderloin Beef $24 and Braised E-Fu noodle (Small) for my family of three. Total bill came up to S$98 including three bowls of plain rice, warm water, tissue, and an iced mocha. The Cod Fish and Tenderloin Beef are chef recommendations and were indeed lip-smacking good.Service was prompt and friendly, especially by the restaurant captain, Ms Duan Li. Another equally friendly and helpful male waiter even served us complimentary individual bowls of soup-of-the-day when I attempted to order a pot after my first order was processed. This was certainly a pleasant surprise.The restaurant also serves dim sum before 5pm. Would likely go back again to try that

One of my friends and her family took us to Dragon Bowl for dinner. The food was alright and the staff was really friendly. I liked the desert best.

Visited this restaurant @ 1.30pm on a Sunday and was asked to wait for our table for 4. Kids were hungry, and I noticed 6 empty tables in the restaurant albeit to cater to larger parties (6 ppl). After waiting for about 10 minutes, I approached the Maitre D' one more time and he said it would be another 20 minutes. I told him there were 6 empty tables in the restaurant and he tells me that they are for larger parties and hope that I understand this is just business.. So what about the business he just lost?? Management, get a grip.. Teach your staff some service and manners.. WILL NEVER VISIT AGAIN!

I was in Singapore on Business and stumbled upon the Dragon Bowl Restaurant when I was looking for a place to have lunch. It is in the Marina Square Mall tucked off in a corner so a bit hard to find but it is worth looking for. The dim sum was very good and the service was fast and excellent. And the provided a complementary soup
3
Service is a little slow. The staff need to be more attentive. Our drinks came after our food was served :/ Selection of food is ok. Was a little annoyed that they weren't serving any of the dim sum range as we would not have seated in the restaurant. Food was ok but slightly over priced for what we ordered. It's not a restaurant I would go back to. The food court above looked so much better and cheaper
5
Seems a bit whiny this, but out with business colleagues in Singapore some of the restaurants are not that "authentic" TBH. This was different though, one of our group knew this place for being busy so booked a table for 8 in advance, we were seated and served starters very soon so no problems with time. Interestingly and refreshingly, the restaurant has 3 or 4 chefs in a small kitchen behind glass, this was good as 99% of the food seemed freshly prepared, we had chicken, vegetable and duck dishes to share, someone asked for a fish dish too, this was freshly prepared and cooked. Great tasting food on our table, friendly staff also

I have eaten at many HK restuarants - overseas and local but the food taste quality and authenticity for Dragon Bowl is surprisingly superb. Service is good and they have a tablet for you to place your orders. Do not get distracted by it. MUST try are teh Peking Duck and Claypot dishes.

We made the mistake of going during Chinese New Year, which saw a strict and very limited menu, serving mass produced tasteless meals, designed to cater for groups.This continually disappoints searching for somewhere for dinner via internet menus, only to make a booking, arrive and then be advised the dishes you have been salivating - are not available.This was our second visit, the first one was average to good but we gave the benefit of a second visit thinking we had selected poorly on the first.This is an expensive cafe type eatery.When I expressed disappointment about not having a choice for the dish selection, my wife and I both felt we were treated rudely
2
We went to the marina square outlet since it is new. I have not tried Dragon Bowl and thought would be good to do so. Ambience is fair and cosy but quite Chinese setting. The food served is average but the waiting time is terrible. I will not return as there is no reason to do so

The place at Marina Square, just below the Food Court was neat and very clean. Though the restaurant was packed, we were greeted with very friendly service and broad smiles. The staff were very accommodative and went out of their way to get us the three child seats. The food was very good - the Peking Duck was succulent and the meat cooked with the Ee Fu Noodle was one of the better ones we had tasted. The SharksFin was average, but the herbal prawn, abalone with mushroom and broccoli was excellent. The steamed pomfret (Teochew style), though a tinge overcooked, was still great too, despite it being a Cantonese Restaurant. The fried rice was excellent, fragrant, and not oily. the roast chicken however, was just so-so. Overall a very satisfying meal
5
Excellent food. The sharkfin with abalone and mushroom and crab fried rice at $30 is a real bargain. The char siew at $16 is soft and tasty. The deep fried beancurd with crab at $14 is actually not the chef recommendation for tofu dish but it is really great to go with rice. The lady recommended some charcoal tofu...but I still think find the crab tofu look more appealing to me. The crab cooked in lobster soup at $78 have thick nice soup. Excellent service and very attentive staff. A happy anniversary for papa and mama
