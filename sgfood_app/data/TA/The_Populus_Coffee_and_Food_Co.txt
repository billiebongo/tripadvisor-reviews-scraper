These style of coffee shops appearing all over Singapore. Reminds me of Melbourne. Not a bad place for a coffee, and some decent breakfast offerings as well. Nice coffee as well.
5
The food here is great as usual. My 3rd time visiting. Brought my gf to this cafe and she likes the food very much. Thumbs up
5
Nice ambience and yummy food.. Don't forget to make reservation first especially during weekend.. :)
5
The place was cosy with nice deco. We had the big brekkie and buckwheat pancake with the teas in pot. Will want to visit again when we have our next brunch.
4
Went on a weekday and it was fairly quiet. Service was prompt! Generous portions and tasty food - had the beef ragu parpadelle.
3
I was there on a Tuesday afternoon and the place was noisy and packed! Better make reservation in advance if you ever plan to be there. We tried the popular Heirloom Rendang Beef Donburi but was disappointed with it. Coffee on the other hand was good. We did not manage to try their desserts but they sure look good. Maybe this is a place for desserts/drinks. They could do better with the mains. I personally feel that the pricing is expensive and does not justify the quality of food. Service was commendable. Staffs were friendly
5
Populus has a knack of serving consistently delicious food and this visit did not disappoint.I came in a group of 3 and 2 of us ordered the Teriyaki Salmon donburi while the 3rd person ordered a big breakfast - we enjoyed our food thoroughly and it was also very filling.I had the teriyaki salmon and luckily, it was not soaked in sauce and but was complemented by some finely cut spring onion and what seemed like pickled vegetables. The balance was just right and was very easy to eat.Though we didn't get to try the big breakfast, our friend can testify for the quality as well as the quantity - she could not finish her meal and would happily return to try other food

I went there for a coffee. I ordered the Expresso with Ice Cream. It is very rich and strong without a tinge is sour. I do not like coffee with a tinge of sour. The ice cream adds a delicious to the strong expresso . I love it !!! I did not order any food but I saw on the menu that there is a good variety of dishes, serving mainly cafe food . The prices are about $20+- . I observed from the other tables that the serving is small. It has an industrial minimalist deco. I do like the LED lights from the ceiling . It adds a rather cozy ambience to it. Symmetry Cafe a better furnishing and ambience. It was not difficult to find a carpark lot along the streets. I will go back for their coffee if I am in that area.

We visited for Sunday brunch, the cafe does not take reservations 1-2 hrs in advance so if you’re a large party plan to book soonerLuckily we didn’t have to wait long, the cafe is a bit cramped for space, the ambience is relaxed and casualWe ordered -Populus Scramble (3.5/5) - overall was tasty & above average - the eggs were not very hot though & the croissant was avgAvocado Green Super Bowl - was ok (3/5)Buckwheat Pancakes- they have a stated wait time of 20mins, but it was well worth the wait. Super fluffy, warm, not overly sweet - amongst the best Pancakes we’ve had (photo attached) - would strongly recommend trying them out (4.5/5
4
Tried the strawberry sundae with waffle - the decorative meringue has a floral taste to it which is rather unique and took me and my friends by surprise. White brew coffee was aromatic, populus scramble tasted better with a dash of black pepper. However, the croissant was surprisingly crispy and flaky! The furnishing of the cafe was also nicely done up and had a modern feel to it. All in all was a pleasant experience except that some staff could be more friendly. The male staff did not even thank us for our visit when he handled our payment - lacked good service.
4
One of my fav places for brunch, though I thought their beef pappardelle used to be nicer and flavorsome. When I had it, it was a little too wet and pasta was a little over. Nonetheless, the other food items and coffee were great.
3
The decor was great, the food was better. But they pack people in like sardines! You can probably only fit half the people but the tiny tables are stuck so close together you can barely breathe!
5
Liked the menu because it’s quite a varied menu for brunch. Different from all the normal stuff. Service takes quite long though so please be prepared to have a leisurely affair
4
Good place, decent price but gets very crowded during the holidays that it makes it hard to have a conversation because it gets loud inside.
Compensated by their spectacular service and food.
5
It is the new year and outside queue was as expected to be long. Food is still good! Will revisit again soon.
4
The lemon tart was very zesty and refreshing. Coffee was decent. Soba was decent too. Rose Tea presentation was very interesting in pot. Pricey though.
5
Last minute decided to find a place to enjoy western brunch and nice coffee with my wife. The reservation was simple and we were brought to our seats upon arrival. Tried their fried chicken with pancake and it was nice. Coffee tasted nice and full of character

Went for brunch today (2 Jan). The restaurant was half full, so not too busy. First impression was positive, cool concept and interesting menu. I ordered the all day big brekky as it has many of the ingredients I like in my b’fast. Shortly after starting to eat I realized something was missing.. looked at the menu again and saw that i was in fact wrong... it wasn’t something.. it was half of it!! 4 out of 8 of the components described in the menu were not on my plate and one that was on the plate was not supposed to be there! But this is not what irked me, everyone can make mistakes (the kitchen staff were prob still hungover from new year celebrations). The manner in which the restaurant dealt with the mistake was awful. The waitress explained that unfortunately the restaurant was out of some ingredients.. they didn’t have potato rosties and mushrooms. And they would send the smoked salmon and sausage separately. So after I was almost done with my eggs I received a cold roll of smoked salmon and a sausage. The manager sent a message with the poor waitress that he would give a staggering 10% discount to make up for the mistake.. to which I replied that I did not expect to pay for the dish. Bill comes and sure enough I was charged for the dish and given a 10% discount just on the price of the dish they messed up (not on the whole bill). I would have expected the waitress to tell me the ingredients were not available before taking my order. I would have expected them to take the plate away and either replace it with what I ordered or offer something else! Failing these I would expect not to be charged for something I didn’t order. It’s quite silly that management believe that compensating $2.5 for serving half an English breakfast to a customer who is willing to spend $25 for full English breakfast would make him feel like a satisfied customer..amateurs.

went There for brunch and had made reservation prior visit. Staffs are not attentive, need a few times to get their attention to have my table. Food is not bad but not as great as expected, seatings are too close to each other, no way a bigger size person can squeeze through unless the person occupying the other table stand up. Saw a skinny young gal squeezing out with difficulty. Services of the gals there are great, but the boys really need improvement . No smile and no response.requested for water, he just looked st us and walked away to bring it without any acknowledgement. Kept walking past us to signal us to leave (I felt so) and when we settle the bills, no word and no smile. With the average food and the services there, I’ll not visit again
3
I went with 3 other friends for brunch on Boxing Day and was looking forward to a nice time. The food we ordered was okay but it was the service that was underwhelming. One particular male staff was always grouchy and didn’t show interest in serving us. It is small detail and gesture like this that makes an potentially good experience become average. I will think twice about returning.
3
Food was good but the place is too squeezy. Place is quite small to move around and tables are close to each other.
Price wise is quite reasonable
4
Food was great with polite and responsive staff. However due to the festive season, service took some time.
4
My first time at populus, nice ambient and staff were really polite. The white coffee is really nice! Shld give it a try (:
4
Nice ambience but rather pricy! Also would like vegan/vegetarian options with the baked eggs - maybe with chick peas?
4
Love the food. The food from its grains, pasta to truffle fries all did not disappoint me! Would love to visit again.
5
Went to Populus for brunch on a public holiday. The place was crowded so do make reservations before heading down. Both the Populus Scramble and the Wagyu Beef Grain Bowl were great.
4
We had pulled pork grain bowl, grass fed beef burger and the cafeâ€™s recommended breakfast scrambled eggs.Very yummy! Cafe was well-lit, simple and pleasant decoration. Servers were attentive in the midst of the lunch crowd chaos. They serve water, but best to ask for an entire jug if you drink a lot so as not to trouble them! The scrambled eggs breakfast was delicious and very generous portions. Food is on the pricey side but hey, good quality food in a convenient location. Wish they had a choice for people on low carb diet for better sports performance (I ask for a big side of salad instead fries, and to have lettuce instead of the burger buns). Thanks for the wonderful lunch meal guys!
4
Not many restaurants/cafe are open for reservations on the Friday before Xmas and they were the exception. We got a place for 6. The cod with cold soba,is a definitely must order and the beef rice bowl is pretty good. Seafood linguine is a tad bland. The portion for the chicken with pancake could be for sharing for 2 ladies as it was really big. Our sides of fried chicken chunks is great. For dessert the strawberry one is better than the Black Forest, do remember to order with waffle! Would come back for a special occasion lunch.
4
Nice place to chill out on a weekend. Food portions are quite reasonable and are good to share so you can try out the various dishes. Would recommend the Buckwheat Pancakes (not too sweet, syrup is served on the side so you can control the amount of syrup on your pancakes), Populus All Day Brekky (good for sharing), The Populus Scramble (although will appreciate if the croissant was more flaky)
5
I first visited the cafe back in June 2017 based on a recommendation of a colleague who had a positive dining experience. I visited the place with my partner for brunch and were impressed with the laid-back, urban-cafe ambiance and their attentive service. I was in Tanjong Pagar area for business last week and decided to take a break at the cafe with a slice of cake. They had two cakes on display that day: Chocolate Cheesecake and Key Lime Pie, and based on the recommendation of the waiter, I opted for the Chocolate Cheesecake.Service was prompt and the waiter insisted that I simply choose a table and make myself comfortable. The slice of cake came very quickly and I quickly dug in. As I was savouring my first bite, I noticed two white spots on the cake but did not bother too much till I inspected it further. I initially thought it was just water droplets, but soon began to wonder if they were mould as there were little 'fur' on the white spots. I brought this to the attention of the staff who quickly apologised and offered to replace my cake.She quickly changed it with a slice of Key Lime Pie (which I was grateful for as I would not have wanted to eat another slice of the Chocolate Cheesecake anyway). She also took the opportunity to explain that the replacement cake was going to taste different from my first choice and to expect it to be a bit sour but refreshing. I actually loved the Key Lime Pie and finished it to the last bite. It was indeed sour but by just the right amount! I paid for the bill and the team apologised again and offered me a 10% discount as a service recovery. Mishaps like these are bound to happen in any dining establishments but what sets this experience apart was that the service staff were quick with their reaction, apologetic, took ownership of the situation and offered a service recovery. It's so hard these days to come across such service, and for their effort, I am rating them 5/5.I will be coming back again for that Key Lime Pie! :
4
Love the ambience, food and coffee here. It'll be good if service staffs can be more attentive to the customers.
4
Have been here several times for my favourite dish, the pulled pork grain bowl. Makes healthy eating enjoyable as I prefer my vegetables served warm, grilled with added flavours. The baked eggs with lamb and buckwheat pancakes (must share) were good too. Worth trying!
5
Very nice ambience for relaxing & chiling on a weekend. Wide variety of food selection. Coffee is great & dessert is awesome too!
4
The food was good in general and they have kept their standards over the years. Truffle fries are a must try
5
Came here for a lunch farewell near our office and the food was amazing. We had the donburi bowl and it was amazing. The serving might look small but it’s really filling. The place is extremely cold though so maybe bring a jacket.
5
Been to Populus many times for brunch and brought many friends there. Everyone loves the food there. Portion and quality of food is consistent. No complains. Always leaving the restaurant with a happy stomach =)
3
Have been invited to this cafe to celebrate my girl friend birthday, friends have mention that the food is good with excellent review. The place is cozy and nice decor, however one of the staff is not very friendly. We have ordered a signature pork chop, seafood linguine and truffles fries, the serving is a bit slow though. When the food arrived, the portion is not that much though, taste wise is just average. One of the friend has ordered the pan cake, she couldn't finish it. Overall not a very satisfactory meal
4
We enjoyed ourselves in this cafe. The place was lovely and the food was great. Coffee was ok somehow, maybe I had higher expectation in this regard. Service was fab except for one less friendly guy whom we encountered towards the end of our visit. He didn't have a great day maybe. Otherwise, all great!
4
We went there for brunch with 3 friends. The decor is beautiful : marbles, woods, etc. The food was very good. I had the avocado green platter which was delicious and healthy - will try to redo at home ! The only bemol is that all eggs white were slightly undercooked. The bill came at 115$ for 4 pax including 3 coffees. My only disappointment is that we got sat at coffee tables upstairs which is not very comfortable to eat - they should let you know upon booking.
5
the food was great and the portion is nice. The managed to serve the food when we requested the food to be served as fast as possible because we were hungry even for the food that needs 20 mins wait. Great service as well. The coffee is great as well. the Chocolate Valrhona is superb according to my friend.
5
Overall was good. It was my 2nd visit there. Pretty full house even on a weekday lunch. Food was tasty!
4
Always go for vege bowl (broccoli)
and sweet potato fries as guilty treats. The fries is good for two/three.
3
Food was excellent but need to improve in service. I don't feel a welcome feeling when i stepped into the resturant as the crew wasn't smiling and greeted us at all.
4
The food and coffee are nice and delicious... Staff are friendly!But with Aircon seat are limited...
3
This is a popular spot that I've been eyeing to dine at for months and finally made it for Friday lunch. Loved the coffee which was the smoothest I've had and with a unique taste.
4
This place definitely has a nice ambience. The waiters were prompt in taking orders and attended to us very quickly. The food was decent but was slightly on the higher end of price.
4
Restaurant had a warmth and earthy vibes! Liked it when they dim the lights (which I think they did at some point!). Everything else was great but slightly cramp! (Y)
5
Went for brunch. Although the restaurant was crowded, the service staff attended to us very promotely. The food was great, so are the service and ambience. Ordered the bounty of the sea grain bowl which was really good. Same for the buf breakfast and vanilla white coffe
3
The second time when we there last Saturday was awful.. I made reservation and they put us at the upstairs newly renovated room.. the chemical smell is not good.. soon as I get in I started have tears after 10mins I was almost pass out.. what can I say really disappointed
5
Cafe is slightly small, causing echo throughout if crowded. A little bit noisy but food was not disappointing. It was great! I loved their savoury pancakes and generous pieces of fried chicken. The burger portion was ok but the taste was very fresh. We enjoyed our meal and would come back to try other dishes on a quiet day
4
It has one of the best brunch food ever! The scrambled eggs with the crossaints are amazing and so are the desserts! :) The pasta however was a letdown, and is extremely pricey for such a small quantity..
1
Staffs were polite and food quality was good. Will definitely be back again!
The only negative point is that the reservation is only held for 5-10mins although it was mentioned via Chope that it will be 15mins.
4
The food was amazing. Service was a little slow but that's standard in Singapore. I would recommend the brioche french toast. Their coffee was great too!
5
The rendang beef was awesome.. a must to try when going there to eat as it soft and the spiciness is just nice.
3
I went there without reservation as this is my first visit on a Saturday noon. Got my queue number n after 15 min, me and my friend got a table (even though there were a few guests in front of us). We just ordered what is recommended by the waitress (good service). The All Day Big Brekky was delicious. As for the Buckwheat Pancake, I find it too thick for my taste. Seafood Linguine is nice but not out of this world. Coffee was good. Price is above average. Overall, a nice place to chill out if you are not in a rush
5
Went for lunch and ordered a (limited edition) Beef Rendang donburi and Teriyaki Salmon Donburi and to put it simply, we were not disappointed.Both came with rice and were so full of flavour and had generous sides and we didn't need to order more drinks/dishes to fill us up more!As always, the service is quick and friendly so no complaints on that front either.Would happily return as their menu just has so much to offer - if you're full, consider a cup coffee/tea/smoothie instead
5
I visited Populus to grab lunch with one of my friends and I have to say it was one of the BEST meals I've had in a long time. I ordered the Avocado SUPERFOOD Green Platter and a Long Black and my friend ordered the Buckwheat Pancakes and the White Cold Brew Coffee. My Avocado dish was hearty and satisfying and my coffee was fragrant and not too strong. My friend's coffee was sweet (naturally, with no added sugar) and came in a cute bottle and her pancakes were sublime. I mean, honestly, she let me taste them and they were literally one of the best things I've eaten in a while. We were both full but still had a Key Lime pie slice to share to finish the meal. It was sharp and delicious. LOVE this place, love how attentive and knowledgeable the wait staff are and love how unique and well thought out the food is. Pro tip - avoid the grain bowls. They might be known for it but their other food is SO MUCH BETTER.

This place has a bunch of terms and conditions for reservations, so my advice to you: please call the resto after you made an online reservation. We made reservation at 11am, but some of us (out of 7) were late then here comes the unwritten t&c mentioned by the greeter guy (which keep on changing every time):11.00: all guests should be here then we can show your table - to be fair with others (hello.. what's the point of making reservation?!)11:10: if half of your group arrived, we can sit you at your table. The logic mentioned by the staff is: if the other walk-in group coming, it would not be fair for them if they give the table for us and only few of us sits there. Excuse me, we made a reservation!!Then we spoke again to him, and asked him if this rule written somewhere in the online reservation - to be fair for us too. He said he will check and went in to get the t&c, but eventually he can't show it to us. He said it's a common understanding (???). How do we know?? This is not the first time we made a reservation in any resto in SG and no such rule! The common unspoken rule is: if guests don't show in 15 minutes, table will be given up.Then after that, he said that we will be asked to go at 12.30 as they can only keep a table for 1.5 hour. We asked again where is this mentioned? He said it's in the menu. Then again, we asked him the menu to show it to us. He could not find it then he said that the staff will mention this to us when we order the food. What the...???!!!!!!All of us eventually arrived at 11.25, and they showed us the table: Downstair. One secluded room. He call it VIP room. With printer, stack of boxes and some messy cables. I guess it's a VVVVIP room.Thank you populus! Top notch
4
We tried the buckwheat pancakes and 'heirloom rendang' donburi. I personally prefer the latter. It was really good for a person like me who seldom takes beef/ mutton due to the strong smell of the meat. However, the beef rendang is a must-try at Populus! Populus offer different menu on weekday and weekdays. Will definitely go back to try the weekdays menu
5
The light filled interior and its interesting mix of materials make a wonderful place for catching up with friends. And the food does not disappoint! The variety interests and satisfies everyone. Portions are amazingly large (it makes it worth the price you pay). Most of all I love love love the huge green bush of Superfood Green Platter - seriously the deepest shade of green I could only ever dream of If I ever crave greens, n o t h i n g is gonna beat this. Coffee is also great, exclusively 2degNorth beans. I've tried the Gibraltar a couple times and its been super satisfying. Not to mention a rare find among cafes, so I'm v happy (
4
Enjoyed my experience at Populous Cafe, the food didn't disappoint me yet again! ◡̈ but probably could consider removing the skin of the fried chicken (the one with pancake) as it was rather burnt and oily.
4
We went in the afternoon so we got the lunch menu. The food was pretty good and the price was reasonable for lunch. I strongly recommend the traffle Wagyu beef bowl. It was very tasty.
5
Place to recharge with good cuppa and food. I love the simple veggie bowl (tho abit oily) and salmon. Would love to go back again.
5
Excellent quality and tasty food. Great for brunch, lunch or dinner.
Recommend beef cheek, Ragu pasta, Rendang, but most of the menu is surprising elaboration of fusion food with various influences from asian and european gastronomy. Worth well the visit!
4
The food here looks too good. Everything that was brought out from the kitchen were the prettiest ones ever. The food was tasty too but I felt it was overpriced. The dark choc ice cream was awesome!
5
A really popular cafe. Their truffle fries are so excellently done. I really love their pancake chicken and their coffee. A really popular cafe so please make reservation before heading down.
5
Had nitro cold brew, fried chicken pancake and bacon with croissant over the weekend. It was yummy and fabulous environment! Thank u!
3
The food and drinks served here are always very good. One thing that disappointed us was that the table was not ready at the time reserved (1pm) and we had to wait for more than 15 minutes to be seated. What's even worse, they gave the first available table to other guests who didn't seem to have a reservation. Then what's the point of making a reservation in the first place
3
I made the reservation via chope and i was glad to have the inner corner seat. Reason being the cafe is way too small and cramp. They arranged the tables very closed to each other(most of the time without asking if the other people are fine with that) and it prompts to danger when people moving around the place with bag etc. You might hit others. Great that my seat has not much space but because we were corner so we got more space than others.Food wise - taste not bad. I will said the scrambled egg is really good. One of the best i had
1
We went there 30mins early with chope reservation and told the staff that let us know when there is seats for us.. we will be waiting outside. But after 30mins of waiting, other people (about 3 different groups of people)whom Q later than us, were able to enter. When we went in to remind the staff again after 30mins, the staff replied that they were still arranging seats for the 2 of us. Then when we finally entered the cafe, the staff just let us sit there without any menu. We need to ask the menu, n only 1 was give to us. Shortly after 5 mins, the other couple beside us were quickly handed with 2 menus! Why? Just because one of them was caucasian? Really disappointed with the service we got!
5
Food and coffee was awesome. Many choices of food from a full course to healthy grain bowls. Staffs were very friendly and attentive too.
5
booked an appointment of 5pm. order the signature buckwheat pan cake. nice but overprice
the pulled pork grain was yummy. As it was a Sunday early evening, there is not too crowded
5
The food here never disappoints! Love the Fried Chicken pancake and their grain bowls, absolutely delicious!
3
Food was not bad but service can be improved. We waited for approx. 20min even though we alr made a reservation.
5
Enjoyed my visit very much, the Heirloom rendang donburi & Tuscan lamb baked eggs were delicious. Had a really good cuppa joe as well. Love the ambiance of the cafe. Service crew were extremely friendly.
3
Food is meh, disappointed. But waffles are good. Will come back for waffles but give the food a miss.
4
Had the buckwheat pancakes:) fluffy and well done indeed! The waiter very nicely recommended that we share the pancake, though I felt that half a pancake for a person might have been a tad little 😅
4
Have always loved food at Populus. It's one of the best cafes (in terms of food) around SG in my opinion. Service is great, as usual too. However, this time was my first time visiting on a weekend and will probably be my last. Will stick to visiting on weekdays. The cafe is generally quite small and it gets quite uncomfortable when it's so crowded and tables are really close to each other. I can hear the entire conversation of the people sitting next to me. Will definitely visit again, just on a weekday instead of weekend!
1
My friend and I reserved a table and waited for a while before being seated. I had looked over the menu beforehand and was delighted to see that they had many salads and options that seemed GF. When we were seated I asked the waiter to point out some items that could be gluten free. He immediately said NOTHING IS GF. I asked if he knew what gluten was and if items like the steak and salads could be prepared without gluten. He said NO. I proceeded to head out when I overheard him asking another staff member about gluten. It's incredibly frustrating. Rather than accommodating and inquiring with the chef, we were just told NO. No empathy or desire to serve customers who had reserved and waited to come eat at their restaurant. It's one thing not to know, but another not to even bother trying to help. Just awful. P.s. I'm not someone who chooses not to eat gluten, I have an anaphylactic allergy to eat. I'm not trying to be difficult, but it's always a pleasure dealing with restaurants who understand this and don't shovel customers out the door!
5
When I travel I often look for off the beaten path places for great food and drink. Populus was a Trip Advisor recommendation and a great one. We went there for the extensive coffee selection as well as a really eclectic food selection. I had the soft scrambled eggs with thick British bacon. My traveling companion had the Avocado Super Food Green Plater and raved about how good it was. Exodic regional coffees. I had the Gibralter latte and the White Coffee (comes in a rootbeer like bottle) Both very very good
4
Price is on the high side, but they do serve a big portion which you can share with friends / family. We ordered granola, chicken rice bowl, big breakfast, and a lime pie. All of them tasted very good.
5
This was my third time back again. Recommended a friend to try and she simply loved it! Their Grain Bowls are highly recommended!
5
Veggie bowl, basically is a bowl of sautéed broccoli, which is filling enough for one. Chicken stew, as usual, was good!
3
Interesting food but price is on the high side. Quantity is generous and water is served. Gd to indicate caroark
4
Nice find along Neil Road. Staff were friendly and attentive. Food was really good and filling even though the portion seemed small. Will definitely visit again soon!
3
This place is crowded! Once you get in though it's ok. Had the Wagyu grain bowl and the rendang don Ito. The latter was actually quite good, beef was well marinated and tender
5
We went for brunch (well, lunch really) as a party of 4 on a busy Saturday. There was a great buzz, an appealing scent of truffle oil and the staff were very attentive (and accommodating, first seating us downstairs on our own, then shifting us up into the main, ground-level section with a better vibe)... Everyone's meal was stellar, I couldn't fault my Wagyu Beef Grain Bowl. Bedded on quinoa, it would be easier for me to explain what WASN'T in it - the complex variety of flavours worked extremely well, including the lightly toasted baby corn. My flat white was also one of the better ones I've encountered in SG... It's a 'yes' from me
3
Wasn't too impressed by the food but I do love the desserts though. The chicken waffle is a little bland and soggy. We were seated in the room in the basement so service was slow, and it was difficult to get someone's attention. Might go back to give it another chance
4
Luckily we booked and secured a table in advance, it seem to be extremely popular and crowded over the weekend. My partner loves their coffee and breakfast as for me I think it is normal... not too big of a surprise.Will I return again? Maybe not as I do not like to brunch in overcrowded place on weekend
4
Place is quite packed when we arrived.. when we left, people were queuing to get in. We just had coffee which was very good. Plenty of dishes as well - items for breakfast as well as lunch / dinner.Would have liked to see acai bowl and some more variety of cakes as well
4
food and service was good (portions were decent and not too ex) but it was a bit noisy probably because it was full at lunch hour.
5
Can't find similar taste of food elsewhere except at this cafe. Food was great and portion is filling! Good for sharing.
4
Populus has been a go to place for coffee and good lunchie. Try the wagyu beef or pulled pork grain bowl
5
Has become one of my regular to have my grain bowl. Not a fan of grain /rice but it was so delicious.
4
My go-to when it comes to casual business catch ups and a no-brainer for brunch on the weekends.
Their cold drip coffee and white cold brew are quite something too.
Remember to make reservations before heading there as they are almost always packed!
5
The food and service are good as usual :)
Came back for another round of brunch during the weekend, and it was crowded as usual.
4
Ate their spring onion pancake and beef rendang don. Both were ok but portion for rendang was kinda small.
5
Have fun celebrating friends bday, cosy and personal basement which is great for quiet choice. Food was served fast as well
4
Reservations was done easily via The Chope app. My friends and I were pretty pleased with the menu offerings, a pretty decent range from the healthy to the not so healthy. Food was served promptly and we enjoyed our meals. While the service staff seemed overwhelmed at times, they were generally friendly and polite. Ambience was great too and they came around to warn people that they were dimming the lights too by a certain time. That was a good call on their part since the dimming was rather abrupt. All in, a really decent place to hang out and catch up with friends.
4
Teriyaki Salmon Donburi ($19+)Yummy fork-tender salmon with a good amount of sauce. Rice was cooked well, too.Pulled Pork Grain Bowl ($19.50+)You might think grain bowls don't fill you up but this was SOLID! The pulled pork was on the dry side, but everything else was delicious & roasted to good texture & flavour. Accepts credit cards (min $50 spend)  Air-conditioned seats Accepts reservations - I used Chope GST only; no service charg
4
One of the cafe in town area with good food... there is 1.5 hour dining time limit on weekends though.
4
Not bad place, delicious grain bowl (just a little more expensive than usual) but pancakes can be better.
4
The food was nice and the service was good, although the place was quite small but overall we were glad to be here for our brunch.
4
Very packed restaurant and they even tell you that u only have a 90min seating time for a meal as they have other reservations to follow up
4
Super love the food and drinks here although the surrounding was quite noisy. Loved the ambience and the yummy sweet potato fries and waffles!
4
Went there to celebrate my friend's birthday and the waiter was very attentive to my earlier request by presenting the pie with candle right after our main. Big breakkie was average but spring pancake with fried chicken tasted good. Overall, thumbs up for their service.
4
I was walking by and stopped for a quick espresso... it was simply wonderful! I will come back again
4
Have not stopped thinking about the Pull Pork Grain Bowl I had during my first trip there. Had their Signature Fried Chicken Donburi this time and it was as good. Will be back again for their Seafood Linguine!
4
The lighting of the cafe is just nice. The design of the cafe is spacious. The menu has variety of food just that the title of the items are not specific & menu needs more creativity & pictures :) The food is nice just that the truffle fries are served in a wrong bowl so when eating the fries, truffles dropped outside the bowl... the wagyu Beef is tender but lack of buttery fresh taste ... The salmon portion is just nice... the chocolate sundae is not nice... Overcome it's good for hanging out & the cafe is clean & neat. The mushrooms in the wagyu Beef rice bowl does not suit the dish... it is better to pair with a poached egg...
4
Recalled my last experience when populus just opened, the lady did not want to entertain me but told me off not to order and on my own risk because I'm allergy to soy, nuts and sesame. This time round was very different, the staff is competent enough and willing to double check with the kitchen. I appreciate a lot. I definitely will be back if the service maintained.Side note: my client loves the cod & leek a lot. The sweet potato fries was good too. However with the size of the cafe is not very suitable for business unless is non peak.
4
food was still great but the wagyu beef was slightly harder and drier than usual. duxton vice and caldera coffee beans awesome.
5
A wide selection of food from pancakes, mains, grain bowls & salads to choose from. Wholesome food done well left a great impression and the plates empty. Would be visiting again!
4
Lovely scrambled egg on croissant breakfast. Tasty freshly squeezed orange juice and a very nice latte.
4
i've been here many times. The food is consistently good. I recommend the truffle fries, chicken grain bowl, pancake and fried chicken!
5
The food was good, and the service was good. Space a little cramp though! Got the Wagyu beef don and it was healthy yet flavourful
4
The greatest plus point would be the ambience. I had the fried chicken spring onion pancake. It tasted fusion. Chicken was good but spring onion pancake was not to my liking. I really like the ambience and friendly staff.
4
No complaints - great food and ambience, perfect for a chill cafe date with friends. Always crowded so making a reservation in advance is recommended!
4
Loved the clean and modern interior of the place. The food was great as well! A recommended place for friends/family gatherings or a brunch date! Plus you can book a table! Major plus point!
3
The service at Populus is brisk when it's to the point of being impersonal and peremptory. As a solo diner, I was placed at one table by a member of the wait staff, then asked to move to a smaller table to make way for a larger group. You queue up to order your food but at least the queue moves. After tiring of waiting for about 20 minutes, I started to read. I did not realise my food had finally arrived, it was just left there by someone without a word. Did someone not want to interrupt my reading? Maybe, but a cheerful "Sorry to keep you waiting" or "Here you go!" would have been welcome
4
For a light yet appetizing meal. The dish was thoughtfully presented with all the ingredients visible all at once. Not only is it attractive looking, its taste is equally tantalizing. The dressing sauce is light and refreshing, the ingredients all healthy and welk balanced. The serving portion is just right for one person. Love the wholesome meal comprising quinoa, pearl barley, sesame seed, red cabbage, grilled cherry tomatoes and butter squash, zucchini, sauteed mixed mushrooms and juicy wagyu. A very satisfying meal indee
4
Always crowded during weekends. Love their foods, and thanks to the crew who helped us by adding a seat last minute.
4
Wide variety of food choices. Price is a little on the high side but still worth. Love the ice mocha & ambience too!
4
Good place for brunch. Food was tastier than next door famous The Lokal, but the seating is very limited.
3
Place is cozy. However, food is so so and overpriced. Ordered one pasta, one small bites, one sundae and no drink and cost me over $50 which is quite high. And there is a minimum of $50 spend for card payment.
5
Great whole-hearty breakfast platter and grain&rice bowls! Friendly service team too! Will definitely be back here again.
4
Nice food. Not as crowded on a Sunday at 4pm. Buckwheat pancake tasted like banana cake though. Found the waffle w ice cream slightly overpriced
3
As my friend and I were trying to find a new brunch spot for our usual weekend cafe hunt in Singapore, we spotted The Populous on Chope and decided to give it a try having read a number of reviews online. Have to say the food were definitely not disappointing, in fact they turned out better than I expected. However, the price is pretty steep, as we were ordering at the counter and paying for our bill it is observed that average cost for 2 people (many patronized in pair) is between 60 and 80. (Very crowded, a line was formed in front of the cashier so we get to know the person's order before us)Last reminder, strongly recommend everyone to visit during off peak hours/weekdays. The place is not exactly as spacious as I thought from the photos I saw online. During weekend it can be really crowded and hard to move in between the tables and chairs
3
While the steal my friend ordered was pretty average, I had the Rendang beef rice bowl which the rendang sauce together with the vegetables sides totally thrown me off. I would definitely recommend ordering that rendang beef bowl. Would love to try their dessert which looked great the next time.
3
Was excited to try the Populus Scramble - this huge croissant with scrambled eggs and bacon on top. Unfortunately, high expectations resulted in great disappointment. The eggs were overcooked, and it had a weird taste to it. Croissant was not crispy - in fact, it was tough to cut into smaller pieces. Disappointment. Better stick to the donburi bowls
4
Went to Populus on Saturday (11th March) for an 11am brunch and was not disappointed.Between 3 of us, we ordered an Avocado Superfood Green Platter, Tuscan Lamb Harissa Baked Eggs and a Roast Chicken Grain bowl.The food took 10-15 minutes to come, which wasn't too long and the service was great. The place is so popular that we had to give up the table at 1pm, which we were happy to do.Pros:- Conveniently located near Outram Park MRT- Friendly service, food served within a reasonable time- Fresh, great tasting food, vegetarian and vegan options available- Solid, free wifi- Water is not ice cold, but room temp- Available on DeliverooCons:- For parents, can be a bit cramped, depending where you sit, but to their credit, they provided high chairs for babies/toddlers- Limited time seating however we were told in advance so not a major gripe- Must order at the counter- To use a credit card, you must order at least $50 worth of food and drinkThe pros definitely outweigh the cons and I would happily go back, it's a place I would take friends from out of town for a meal as well - best to book in advance for larger groups too
4
Everything was good about Populus Coffee (food, ambience and location). The only disappointment was it's mediocre customer service. :(
3
We ordered a total of 8 dishes and the waygu beef bowl was good but the truffle fries was abit too oily.
4
The ambience and layout was so comforting, it's like you'd be able to eat in peace. Pity it's self-order! Didn't try the mains, but prices are on the higher end especially for the soft serve i ordered. Will reconsider returning.
4
Nice food. But its abit squeeze for the seating. Will be going back there to dine in the next time..
5
Populus is still one of my best brunch place in Singapore.
Love the ambient, the food (which are generally deliciously).
4
Lovely place for brunch! There is enough choice on the menu, the coffee is good, the service is friendly and the place has a nice buzz to it.
5
Food at Populus are better then most cafes and you can be assured of a wholesome and satisfying meal. The dessert portion is huge so unless you have an extremely sweet tooth, it's recommended that the dessert is for sharing.
5
I love everything in this cafe. Do not miss their grain bowl and hot chocolate! I am a frequent supporter and definitely come back again!
4
Excellent scrambled eggs on croissant. The addition of little details like dill and chili brings the eggs to another level. Recommended to make a reservation, as the place can get really crowded.
4
The staff were accommodating, and made arrangements so that an additional friend of ours could sit with us. Quality of food was good. Seafood linguine had a decent portion of scallops and crab meat. The beef ragu pappardelle was generous in portion, and above average in taste. Overall, great chill vibes and yummy food
4
We like the strong presence of their cuppocino, food was all photo friendly but damage was on the high side.
4
nice cafe with good and healthy food.. suitable for quick lunch. crowd gathers around noon time.....
4
We were quite early for our reservation and they manage to get us seats. Food was good. Will try the coffee and desserts the next time. Coffee smells great!
3
Nice food, lots of different things on the menu, great healthy selection, and usually plenty of people in the place.
5
Excellent place for a gathering with friends!
Everything was great, from food ro atmosphere. Highly recommended.
4
Loved the blond wood paneling and use of dark brick. Created a cozier feel compared to the usual cement/warehouse genre of coffee joints. Tables a tad too close to each other though. Plus point is being able to reserve through Chope do a Saturday 3pm. There was a long line waiting otherwise 
2
Disappointing service and disappointing food today at Populus.My daughter recommended we have light Sunday lunch here after walking this morning in the Botanic Gardens.It's a restaurant in Neil Street where a number of new eateries have started up recently'.Well we didn't have a reservation but no worries we waited about 10 mins and we're asked to sit down.We have to fight our way to our table as everyone is crammed back to back.I bump into three or four people getting to our chair which is really embarrassing and completely avoidable. Then we sit down only to be told we have to go to the counter and order and pay for or meals in advance. So I get up bump into 3 or 4 people again and make the order. As the restaurant is full with more than 50 people and only one guy is taking the orders I am required to wait another 10 mins prior to placing my order.I asked for a simple burgher well done and a meal for my daughter. Well my daughters meal comes out almost immediately and my meal a full 15 minutes after hers. By the time my comes she is almost finished as I asked to eat whilst it was still hot.Then you can imagine my disappointment when the burgher arrives it is not well done but medium ( see photo). I was thinking of telling the waiter to ask for it to be cooked, however given I didn't want to bump into everyone again, so I didn't bother.I thought about not writing a review and just forget it as I won't go My suggestion is the restaurant needs to spread out a bit and pass menus to people like us that waited outside so that as soon as u come inside u can pay straight away or pay while waiting,,,,Anyone I won't be going back

Fourth time here, a few hit and misses but I'm always looking forward to coming back here for my favourite dishes. Very much in love with their french rose buds tea too! Here are some I've tried:Truffle Wagyu Beef Donburi - My favourite out all the dishes I've tried, in fact I find myself craving for this every now and then. Very tasteful and everything blend well together. But sadly they only have this on weekdays.Buckwheat Pancakes - I wasn't that keen on this because I'm not a thick pancakes person (like the pancakes from Paddy Hills was too dry and thick), but this was surprisingly good and moist! A good mixture of sweet and sour (love the addition of the passionfruit curd!). Wagyu Beef Grain Bowl - This is definitely something to consider if you are looking for something healthy with protein. The Populus Scramble - YES to the scrambled eggs. I've tried better ones (Pacamara!) but this was pretty good too. Spring Pancake & Fried Chicken - I guess this is one of their signatures but it was a miss for me. Wasn't a fan of the spring onion pancake and the ranch dressing was too thick for my liking. Rendang Donburi - Again, signature dish but I'm not a rending person so I didn't enjoy this. Love the japanese rice but there wasn't a lot of meat. Pricey but there's no service charge. Ambience is great for a date or catching up with friends. Photogenic for instagram. Very friendly staff. Overall, a must visit
4
I've only tried the wagyu and pulled pork grain bowl but it's soooo AWESOME. It's delicious, great taste but at the same time you will feel healthy and clean after having it. I brought my mum there and she absolutely loved it. I have yet to try the other dishes, but looking forward to it. Staff are friendly and prompt as well. Great place to for healthy meal, catch up and coffee whether with friends or family.
4
My friend ordered the beef bulgogi with quinoa while I had the Populus scramble. Ingredients in both dishes were fresh and the addition of feta cheese to the scrambled eggs was a touch. Both portions were generous. The service here is excellent even though there is no additional service charge.
4
Nice cafe. Small place but cosy. The coffee is good and the food as well. Unexpectedly very crowded on Sun brunch time, is good to make reservation to avoid disappointment.
5
Came here twice for lunch, and food is awesome. Ordered the Avocado sandwich toast and lamb kinda stew dish. Would definitely return again!
3
We ordered the coffee and cold chocolate which were normal. The chicken waffle was soggy. Our seafood pasta was very very bland.
Not sure why this place is popular. Our bill came down to 67 sgd which was overpriced for our food + its quality.
4
Love the food here, especially the rice bowls. Good quality ingredients were used. And the atmosphere is great here.
3
Although I enjoyed the service and the food at Populus, I thought the portions was a bit small, and the price a bit expensive. Two of us had to order 3 mains before we felt full.
2
Sundae and waffle cost $20 - not worth it considering it was just ok in terms of taste. Scramble and croissant were alright but not worth $18.50 either. Thankfully there was no service charge but service standards were pretty poor...
4
Service at The Populus is always warm and attentive. Perhaps that's the reason why it's swarmed on rainy days. But I'm running out of things to eat here. Wish the donburis were more substantial.
4
Loved the game waffles and ice cream! Ice cream wasn't too sweet and very refreshing. The waffles were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.
5
food was great!! but kind of pressured to eat fast, when the first thing waiter told me when I sat down was that I have 1.5hr . had the fried chicken pancake (didn't really like the corn pancake though), and the populous scramble (v v yummy scrambled eggs!). the place was packed on sat early afternoon. be sure to reserve before heading dow
2
We said - can we please order some toast with Vegemite? Staff member - Sorry,no Vegemite after 11am. We said - So not even for a screaming toddler? Staff member - No, sorryWe said - So what happens to your Vegemite after 11am, does it disappear?Staff member said - I don't know...Very weird policies, and staff members with no concept of customer service. Coffee was ok but nothing to write home about. Should have just gone to Common Man Coffee Roasters instead. Wasted money on 2 taxi rides to get to this place.
5
Good vibe for casual brunch on the weekend. Big portions meant for sharing. Service was nothing to talk home about
5
Populus' coffee is what that keeps me returning, and their food needs no further compliments because they will speak for themselves when you try them. Small cosy place, great for a weekend brunch
4
Great cafe food but slightly pricey. Very crowded even on a weekday; best to make a reservation in advance.
5
Not your average fusion cafes..the breakfast croissant is really yummy, good coffee, great pasta. Quick service and short waiting time for food. Long wait for a table though cos it is so popular.
4
The service from the waitor is good . Food wise , the quality is good and fresh .. however , the cooking style is not up to my liking
4
A bit of a wait for food, but good food and good coffee. Tried the white brew for the first time, not too bad!
4
Went there for brunch on Saturday. Good thing that we made reservation in advance. The area is not very big but it gives you a cozy feeling.The team members were friendly and full of smiles.Food - We ordered Truffle Fries with Parmesan Cheese, two thumbs-up! The Populus Scramble which surprises us with the serving portion. Can be sharing portion for 2pax, it's delicious. You can select extra items to add-on, of course with additional cost. Butter Rum Banana French Toast is delicious too.And lastly, the Buckwheat Pancakes, it's not soft nor fluffy. In baking term we would like to say it's very dense and heavy. I will not suggest that you eat this alone. The pancake is too heavy for 1 pax
5
The service was good. The waiting time for food was appropriate and the quality of food was beyond expected. I had the seafood linguini and the seafood was so fresh. For desserts, I had the black forest sundae with buttermilk waffles and the sundae ice cream was unlike any I've tried! So wonderful
3
We ordered a seafood pasta and a salmon soba. The food tasted awesome and so were the coffee. We were there during christmas eve afternoon and was welcomed with a good ambience. The only disappointment was the chocolate ice cream which was not as great as expected
4
This place was packed when I visited and happy to say, my chai latte and burger was great, along with the waffles and ice-cream I had later. Can't remember the one I had but it was a limited edition flavour of ice-cream. My friend's coffee was good too. Definitely gets a little noisy when the place is full, so possibly not for long intimate catch-up sessions, but a nice place to zip to for coffee, nosh and dessert :
5
Great coffee and international breakfast ... suitable for all occasions. Would recommend for anyone to try.
4
Had a Christmas Eve with the boyfriend here, prices are slightly on the steeper side but definitely worth a visit as the food and service are both great ☺️
4
Food is really quality. Portion don't look big but 4 of us(ladies) very filling with 3 mains. I love the 'Spring pancake and fried chicken', and 'wagyu beef grains bowl'. My friends love the 'Avocado Superfoods Green Platter', I am not a fan of broccoli.
3
we tried their fried chicken on pancake, the overall taste was ok but abit dry.. their fried sweet potato is quite nice, got buttery flavor and some spices.. the iced mork chocolate was thick n flavourful..
4
Lovely place with good selections of food. It makes us want to try everything! We had the Wagyu Grain Bowl $24, Cod with Soba and Beef Redang Bowl. Everything is 👍🏻.
4
Bad part is that the place is rather small and crowded, so noise is all around. Gotta talk at top volume to be heard across the table.
3
Had the fried chicken with pancakes; chicken tender/juicy. Ask for it to be cooked well or you will get pink chicken; apparently undercooked chicken is a local thing.Tasted good but too greasy. Pancake lacked flavor as it was just soaked in chicken grease.The sweet potato fries were well fried and crispy.The buckwheat pancake was good too worth getting.If you come to this place make sure you order the good stuff as not everything on menu is great. The buckwheat pancake, fries, and avocado super food are all good. The fried chicken and chicken bowl was meh
4
This was a really nice place for brunch! I had the avocado superfood, which was absolutely delicious. The sourdough bread was amazing. The buckwheat pancakes were good but dry. The iced chocolate drink was really good. The fried chicken was tender but oily, not their best.
3
Food was a little on the pricey side. I came with my baby but service staff placed us at an awkward position where waiters come and go constantly. Kicked my baby's chair couple of times but appeared unapologetic at all. We moved to another spot ourselves
4
The staffs serve attentively. Ordered a wagyu beef grain bowl and it tastes so nice, except that the beef was quite difficult for bite, maybe because it's half cooked. Very full because there's grain. Wanted to try the one with lobster but changed my decision because of its price. :
5
Love the whole set-up and the food!! It was very tasty, yet healthy. Especially the grain bowls! Great environment to just hang out!
5
perfect place to go for brunch and lunch on a weekday! the donburi was on a discount and absolutely value for money! grain bowls are extremely healthy!!
5
Cod fish is over cook (soba salab)
Value is a bit pricey
Atmosphere is awesome
Coffee was great
Overall its great.
4
Love the grain bowls here. The flavours of the various ingredients add up to an appetising meal. And the service staff are attentive, friendly and accommodating.
4
The pulled pork and wagyu grain bowls were excellent!!!! Each part of the bowl had a unique taste to it. The buckwheat pancakes were definitely instagram worthy and they were definitely fluffy, but a tad to thick for my liking
4
Nice setting for a meal.and would recommend the truffle fries and ice-cream waffle. The truffle fries with parmesan cheese were great, and the waffles were crispy on the side. And the lemon ice-cream was very nice.
5
We enjoyed our brunch. The food was delicious and the service was great! Coffee was very good. Loved the bright airy feel to the restaurant!
5
Despite the steep prices for the grain bowls and seafood pasta, the ingredients were fresh and delicious.
4
We had difficulties to decide where to go for brunch that Sunday in Chinatown area. Finally we settled on this place and glad that we did. There was a queue at the other place nearby, The Lokal. We were lucky when we only had to wait 5 min to get a table for two here. One thing to note, the system is mixed of self-service and served by waiters: orders have to be placed at the casheer even when you've secured your table; tap water is self service. Anyways, the food is good and in good portion size, service is quick and efficient. The place is a bit crampy but I think this is rather common in Singapore
4
The decor is industrial yet chic. A lot of wood, some marble and some metal. The design is consistent and harmonious.It is wise to book as i notice a steady stream of patrons soon after opening with a queue. Especially if you have more than two persons.The coffee is great. About a quarter of the shop space is taken up by the counter so you can see the coffee making. Kitchen seems to be in the basement.The food is decent. The scrambled egg on toasted croissant was nice. The bacons had a fair bit of meat, and was not fried crispy. Different way of eating.The buckwheat pancake took a while and was quite heavy. Not too buttery.We could not eat desserts after that. Will return
5
The food was splendid, we ordered 5 mains and they were great! The service was remarkable, staff were really attentive.
4
Great alternative to your usual brunch fare. I had the beef donbori, while my friend had the beef grain bowl. Both delicious!
4
Service good. FOod good. Atmosphere is good. Better to make reservation! Can be crowded during lunch.
3
Without the VISA promotion of $10 discount, the price is overrated. Can get better elsewhere.
You could hardly taste the truffle flavor, and the beef isn't tender enough.
5
Came here for lunch during a weekday. Heard great reviews about the coffee served at Populus and I was not disappointed. We ordered flat white and magic, so aromatic I would come again!
3
Nice place just a bit crowded ..
1) food is good I tried the scrambled eggs and beef and the pancake is to die for ...
2) COFFee is specialitycoffee and it's good too.
3) Nice service and atmosphere ..recommend to visit
4
If you are looking for a place for breakfast this is the place to be. Great big portions delicious food. Great simple service leaves you to enjoy your meal and the venue. Spend some time and enjoy. We will be back. Enjoy.
5
I do NOT say this lightly. The beef rendang at Populous surprised me too. Incredibly tender beef that I was cutting with a spoon, quality Japanese rice, and the best part is generous portions of achar and pickles!!! They're onto something. I know it's packed with Millennials looking to Instagram their scrambled eggs on toasted croissant (which was also great) but think outside the box, and you'll find deliciousness!!! Ps not family friendly, will only go back without my 2 kids
4
The place: nice small coffee shop tucked away, It was not extremely busy on a Sunday morning around 9:30 am.The food: we had the Populus scramble, the Avocado superfood and the buckwheat pancake.All three were good, I would recommend the Buckwheat pancake, it came in a skillet, was thick with crunchy edges. Perfectly done in my opinion.Value: average +. The food is very good it is expensive
5
I went to Populus for brunch after making a reservation on Chope. Our table was ready right away and we had two hours for brunch as the next reservation was at 1pm (ours was at 11am). We ordered the rendang donburi and lamb dishes with the Colombian and Ethiopian drip coffees. The food was prepared quickly and was delicious. Both dishes were flavorful and hearty. While the portion sizes are not huge, they are definitely filling. I would definitely return, but with a reservation as the queue seemed quite long. You order/pay at the counter so there is no service charge, which is a great positive.
4
I have visited populus cafe for quite a few times, with different groups of friends who were satisfied with my recommendation of this cafe! The food there never fails me, esp. their rice bowls!
4
although there was a slight wait, it was worth it afterall. the food was pretty amazing - the croissant and eggs were tasty and thoughtfully prepared. enjoyed my session, would come back to try other stuffs on their menu!
3
The shop was nicely decorated but food was on the expensive side and we waited for about 25-30mins for our food. Coffee was good though.
5
Came here with a group of 14 people for brunch. Place was filled. Food was very interesting and well presented. Taste was great! Just a bit cramp. Their signature croissant with scrambled eggs and bacon was really nice. We had quite a number of items for sharing and were happy with them all
5
It's a cozy little cafe and there were hardly any seats when we went, but fortunately I made a reservation on chope. Shared the spring pancake & fried chicken, as well as the truffle fries with my friend. The spring pancake & fried chicken portion was a little too much for the 2 of us, but it was still good overall, not too oil. The truffle fries were crispy, topped with a heavy truffle flavor. Wanted to try the popular banana rum French toast but it was sold out :( I will be back to try that out the next time
4
We made a reservation at 6pm on a Friday but we were 20 mins late as we were caught in a jam we manage to arrive with the place still filling up and we manage to get seated by the pleasant staff. We had the Beef Ragu and the Cod Soba they we done pretty well and it tasted great, the price however was a typical cafe price so no surprise there. The place looked rather pretty and the decor was simple and neat however the lights were rather hash and i was hard not to get caught in its gaze which temporarily affected our vision
4
Weekend brunch with girlfriends. We booked for a group of 11, they gave us the "private room" in the basement which is really an office with tables and chairs, cramped space but better than dining area with tables so close to each other. Food was amazing though, great coffees, smoothies and solid brunch food. Grain bowls, pancakes, waffles all were very goo
2
This was my 3rd time back to Populus, the first 2 times being a major disappointment due to horrid service. This time round, once again, the kitchen messed up our orders, serving the dessert before the mains. This was despite me having expressly informed the cashier. To make things worse, another table that came later had their mains served to them first. Populus really, really needs to work on pacing their kitchen orders and to serve orders up in an orderly manner. It's unfortunate that on all 3 occasions of my visits, Populus' dreadful service quality was sub-par. The food quality and plating helped to salvage a 2-star rating. I probably won't head back
3
Spend a lazy Sunday afternoon with 7 friends and enjoyed this place. The staff were friendly and accommodating even though my friends came at different times; they sprang into action once a nearby table became available and joined the tables for us to make it more comfortable. Food was great and the coffee (recommend the magic) was fantastic. The space is a little squeezy though and moving in and out of your seats maybe a problem without getting your neighbors to let you through. Only deficiency was they forgot about one order item and had to be reminded. That was when things were slowing down so not sure what the reason was. Recommend the superfood platter and waffles too.
4
I've been wanting to visit this cafe for a while, as it opened to much fanfare. Few cafes in Singapore are thoughtful with their food, and place more focus on their coffee and dessert. Populous is one of the few that bothers with quality of produce and the small touches of seasoning, and it shows. The coffee is better than average. However, service was a little dodgy. When we asked for an extra loaf of bread to go with our harissa baked eggs, our server gave us a perplexed look and paused... we added quickly that we were willing to top up for it, but he still seemed confused. It took us a while to make sure that he understood our request.. a small blip in service but it was truly baffling. Otherwise, the staff members were all very warm and welcoming
5
Excellent food, healthy and tasty options, priced reasonably, good service. Was great for a weekend brunch. It fills up fast to reserve in advance
5
The food servicing in this small restaurant is very unique. It's a fusion of French and South east Asia taste.
4
Ordered the beef burger (with shoestring fries) while my friend ordered the salmon donburi. A bit on the pricey side but overall still acceptable. Tried their iced caffe mocha since I heard good things about their coffee but perhaps the iced version was meh.
4
Popped in here after lunch today for a coffee. The cappuccino was great: nice little design, right temperature and plenty of good coffee taste. I was surprised to see how busy this place was at lunchtime considering the location. Worth a visit though.
3
Fresh healthy ingredients served in a very modern and casual environment. Not the cheapest place but very good eating and drinks.
5
My hanging out place, love the wagyu truffles donburi to the max!😍 Best place to catch up with friends to go with good foods. Reservation recommended, as most of time are packed!
3
An expensive coffee shop which is quite contrived and generally unfriendly to customers. They have about seven managers and no decision makers.While the fit out is nice I find it cold and unwelcoming. Plenty of people parked for hours on end enjoying the wifi.Both drinks and food menu are prohibitively expensive to make it a regular event. An ok Plan B if The Lokal a few doors down is full or closed
4
Managed to get a booking at the venue 3 days earlier. When I reached the place, ambience feels quite homely. Ordered wagyu beef grain bowl and friend ordered cod fish soba. Both tasted delicious. We both ordered ice mocha and it was quite "thick" and not diluted. Overall good experience, will go back and try other items on the menu next time.
2
Food and coffee is not bad but this place is not the best option if you're looking to just chill over brunch on the weekends (which if you ask me, is the whole point of weekends). For one, you can't make a reservation between the hour of 11 and 2, and once you're there, they start chasing you out after 1.5 hours to make way for the crowd. Uncomfortable but ok, fine. I guess space in Singapore is very limited. But what I don't get and don't agree with is that they charge you an additional $2 to pack your food if you can't finish it. The reason given to us by the wait staff was: "Oh we want to discourage food wastage, so this is meant to be a deterrent for people and a reminder not to waste food." Huh?? The reason why I want to pack is precisely because I can't finish and don't want the food to go to waste. This ridiculous policy in fact deters me from packing and thus guaranteeing that whatever I cannot finish will definitely be wasted! Unless the intention is to force people to finish their meals no matter what even if they are full, which is equally illogical. I wouldn't go back to a place that runs its business in a way I don't agree with, nor would I recommend it to my friends.

We had The Populus scramble, beef ragu pappardelle and pulled pork grain bowl. The dishes were beautifully presented and portions generous. The pulled pork was a tad too dry for my liking (this could just be personal preference), but otherwise the scramble was delicious and the beef ragu absolutely spot on in terms of flavour and texture.Will definitely be back to try other items on the (pretty extensive) menu

2nd time here. Food, coffee, ambience great. Not your typical brunch menu.
Reservations highly recommended. Will be back
5
Had the fried chicken with spring pancake and the slow cooked beef cheeks and they were both really good! Their dessert looked fantastic as well and we can't wait to drop by again.
4
Delicious choices for brunch or lunch, so I'll have to return to try out other things on the menu and for dinner some time! Always good to find European food at a reasonable price in Singapore.
4
The food taste good with adequate portion. Environment is good but space is limited. Price is acceptable and coffee can be improved.
5
Awesome food and beverages selection. Thousands of ingredients in a dish, creative, detailed, flavourful and not boring, makes the money worthy. Spacious and cozy. Hoping for more friendliness and attentiveness from the staff.
5
Enjoyed all the dishes. Great fusion of cuisines. Enjoyed the coffee as well. Definitely a place to go to again. Staff are very helpful.

We ordered the Populus all day breakfast. But the ham was cold. We have already reserved in advance, our 2 seated table was so close to the 4 seated table next to us that we can hear all their conversation. Half way eating, the 4 seated table next door left, we were then asked to move to another seat as there is another reservation for 6 seats. Very poor service and the food and value is overrated. The restaurant is trying to maximise profit at the expense of customer experience. The seating arrangement should be reloooked into as the proximity is just too close to the next table
5
Came on a Saturday around noon time and cafe was already packed along with a queue in line. Appreciated that they have the queuing system that gives out queue numbers.. It was a perfect cafe to enjoy a slow brunch and we absolutely enjoyed the food! (Not so much for the drinks)Love the croissant with egg and bacon, as well as its truffle fries. The chicken with pancake was pretty decent, while the buckwheat pancake was a little too filling (even for five persons share). Overall, it was a great dining experience. Will be back again
4
The cafe is brightly lit with warm lights that gives it a cosy feel. I wanted to try their heirloom rendang but was available only after 6pm. So we've ordered the roasted chicken grain bowl, seafood linguine, and a strawberry and elderflower sundae with buttermilk waffle. We love how the food were presented and they taste awesome! Will definitely be one of my favorite cafe from now on
5
Heard about Populas for the last 9 months and wanted to try their coffee and food since. Was invited by my business associate and was 8 of us. Manage to order plenty of food and drink to try out. My favorite is the Pappardelle beef stew and the batter chicken on top of the pancake.
4
Enjoy the dishes served here as it is pretty unique in taste . Buckwheat pancake is interesting and the seafood linguine served is amazing with the succulent scallops , crab meat and lobster tail.
5
Had a quick meetup with girlfriend over lunch and coffee. Simple furbished with pretty good coffee. Girlfriend likes the ricebowls over there. Her 2nd visit in fact. Will be back again near future.
4
Book in advance to avoid disappointment as the venue is small. Its signature dishes are totally awesome!
4
The cafe have nice ambience and staffs are very friendly and approachable. However, the food is not up to expectation.
4
Nice and comfortable cafe setting with friendly staff. Chocolate-full experience with Mork Cold Chocolate and Dark Chocolate Sundae with Waffles!
5
I loved the coffee and food here - very nice, relaxed vibe. Always busy but not too much, never too loud - just a friendly, buzzy feeling about it. We went back a few times for breakfast only - food was super yummy!!!!

We were there on a rainy Sunday, lunch time. Place was packed (tho it is a very small shoplot, narrow and long) and there was a queue outside. We waited about half an hour so it wasn't too bad. I noticed that quite a few of the diners tho finished with their meals, had no consideration of the fact that the cafe was so packed and popular, with people waiting outside, with small kids, and it was raining.... I know they have the right to stay and enjoy the company of friends and family, but c'mon, let's show some consideration for the hungry diners and little ones. I think it would be difficult for the wait staff to hurry the customers so the customers should practice some thoughtfulness themselves. Wait staff were attentive and frantically busy, but you could tell they were trying to accommodate the customers wherever possible. Kudos to them.The food was good, and arrived quite promptly. One orders at the counter and pays first. We had the Kale salad on a large slice of artisan bread slathered with avocado - yummy! The roasted cod on soba was refreshing and light, great choice! The beef cheeks were very tender and generous portion. Drinks of coffee, hot choc and detox juice were all good. We finished everything! Too full to try their key lime pie. I would recommend this place, but maybe not on a weekend? Not sure if weekdays it would be that busy. Definitely a place where the urban young like to gather and lovely if it has a much bigger area - the noise can get a bit too loud
4
Had initially wanted to try their wagyu beef don but upon ordering, was told that it was sold out on the afternoon I went. Hence, i went for the cod fish with soba noodles and was recommended a rose bud tea which was light and refreshing. The soba noodles had a sourish taste and definitely whet my appetite. Would definitely order this again. However, portions were a little small for the price tag. The iced latte was definitely one of the best we've tried so far in Singapore. Thumbs up for that
4
A rare cafe that serve both coffee and tea. The coffee was good, and saw people enjoying tea in elegant pots too. to our surprise, they serve great food. we particularly like their signature scramble egg served on croissant and rice bowls too! its good to find this great cafe with healthy food choice such as rice bowl and salad bowl
3
Lunch with former colleague. Had Lobster Linguini which looked excellent from neighbors table (very close seating). Okies, but not great. Tea in mug that were cracked did not taste good. Loud and noisy.So, if you want to feel like you are "hip", then you could go there, but I remain unconvinced regarding their cooking abilities.First time I was there they served sandwich which was large, but meat contained cartilage
5
All was good. Food was very tasty. Service crew were very polite. Ambience was very cosy and peaceful.
4
First time at the cafe. Thumbs up for the food. Super delicious. A pity that it closes too early on a public holiday. Definitely should make reservation or you'll have to wait.
5
Reservations are highly recommended as it was very crowded when we arrived! The food was great but on the pricey side for a cafe! Nevertheless, will definitely be back!
4
We liked the pulled pork grain bowl for the meal time and the monolith for our flat whites. All in all a great meal. Conversations were all shared with the narrow space in between tables. Service was good but very slow.
5
Really good service. Only drawback is queueing to order at the cashier, pretty slow. Crowded and small spaces. Unique menu, different from other brunch places. Great coffee. Pricey though.
4
Hippy cafe, try one of the their signature breakfast. The cafe latte was good and the staff is friendly and helpful. Even Friday morning was crowded..,
3
I love my ice dark chocolate buy i dont think i will come back again..why? 1. Long queue 2. The place is very small and crowded 3. The food was good (70/100) 4. The waiter is friendly but the service is quite disappointed. They put the food and drinks in hurry without telling the names. You cant enjoy the place too long and chit chat coz they will ask u politely to leave. They run out of table! Please reconsider to have birthday party or reunion with friends in this place. Absolutely not worth for the money.
2
Ok, breakfast should not be that hard to get right.Populous seems famous for its scrambled eggs on crossiant. So why is the bacon undercooked/almost raw the coffee tepid at best and the croissant stale.The service is attentive but slow. The customer goes to the counter to order which means there are too many customers moving around a tight space when there is plenty of staff to take the order
4
Came here for late lunch (weekend menu) and this place was place, great coffee and the baristas whom took my order recommend me a blend for my espresso which was strong and creamy. Had the Wagyu beef cheek grain bowl and pulled pork grain bowl which comes with brown rice and quinoa respectively for those looking for healthy meal (they do have normal diet option). Food are favoursome and good balance which reminds me of Indonesian style cooking influence with organic ingredients.
5
Came here for a late lunch on Saturday and the place was filled with (young) people. Ordered wagyu beef grain bowl and my friend had the pull pork grain bowl. We were both very satisfied with our grain bowls and went ahead to order the buckwheat pancake. Oh my - this is a must try! It was so so good, hot from the oven! However, they forgot to serve our caffe latte.
4
Ambience at 6pm is just nice. Not so crowded. Food is decent. Ordered beef cheek and roast chicken grain rice.
1
The foods taste so so but expensive..the dark chocolate sundae is sucks..weird mixture taste...very disappointed and I won't come back..
4
Friendly greeted by the staff when I stepped in. They have a wide range of coffee. If you're a coffee lover, go try their special brew. Seafood linguine with lobster tail is a must try!
4
The food is good and awesome. That will be one of the cafes that i will go when I am in Singapore. Try their coffee too.
4
The food was great. The restaurant was very cozy too.The service staff is very attentive when we entered. We made reservations ahead of time and our table was ready for us even when we reached 10 mins earlier.
4
Modern cafe with friendly service.Food and coffee are both good, and with its convenient location to my work, i've added it to one of my to-visit cafes.Been there twice and tried the grain bowl on both occasion (wagyu beef and pulled pork)- although I was slightly disappointed with the wagyu beef, I enjoyed the rest of the grain bowl.Hope to be back again soon to try the desserts
4
The "Heirloom Rendang" was delightfully refreshing, with the pickles & achar. And true to the "Limited Edition" signage in the menu, there were limited stock when we ordered for lunch. "The Populus Scramble" felt more like an omelette though. The ambience was great, with the warm lighting, but we got a table under the aircon, which was quite a bummer in the rainy weather. However, the staff make up for it with their smiles & good service. Reserve before you go to avoid disappointment, as it can get really crowded
4
The food is kinda ex for the quantity. Nonetheless the mains are pretty tasty. I had the rendang bowl and beef pappardelle. Rendang not the usual familiar taste, tad too coconutty for me. Beef pappardelle is very yummy. The highlight for me was the soft serve. The sticky date pudding was slightly overcooked. The Base of the pudding was burnt and charred and too hard to chew even.
4
My 1st visit to this cafe today! Come with a reservation if you don't want to wait.The food was good! Had truffle fries, beef ragu pappardelle and rendang donburi. The food came in whichever order the food was prepared 1st (our fries came last).Drinks were a bit exp though. I ordered a pot of french rose buds and the pot was pretty small for the price
5
This place is currently my most favourite cafe in SG except for just one thing, the price. Although the price is alittle on the high side, i feel that all the other factors make up for it. I loved the service, the ambience, the quality ingredients they use and the professionalism of the crew. I paid $18 for a croissant and scrambled eggs, imo, its abit too pricey. If the price point was overall lower, it would be the PERFECT cafe in Singapore
5
The place serves up delicious and very well-plated dishes. Be sure to try their seafood linguine and waffles with decadent dark choc soft serve (good for 4).
4
Food was amazing but unfortunately the donburi rice bowl was sold out so we didn't get to try that. Their avocado superfood meal was awesome and surprisingly filling! I'd definitely want to visit again soon :)
4
The only thing they failed to impress me was that my reservation at 2:30pm was delayed and they didn't reserved the seats which I would have expected. I was 15 mins early as well. Other than that, it was fantastic and memorable.
4
Food is good! But, service wasn't attentive. Truffles fries was burnt and the kitchen allowed service person to serve it to our table. Left a remark, but doubt the waiter inform kitchen.
1
Food was mediocre - I had their beef ragu, not salty enough and no tomato taste. Nice café but they ruined it by cramping the tables. You can barely get to your table without asking everyone to stand up and let you in. Feels like a school canteen and definitely not worth the prices they are charging. Only saving grace is coffee is good and the staff are friendly but seriously, they should do with less tables and improve on the foo
1
Ordered 2 mains and only 1 arrived. Had to wait for 45mins from ordering to get the other main - the Wagyu Donburi. The problem was we had to check with the waiter to understand what the delay was before he mentioned that they had run out of rice! And we did not feel any sincere apologies from the waiter on the delay. When the food arrived, the grains used as a substitute for the rice was warm, but the wagyu beef was cold, and the onsen egg was a mess (i.e. broken). Does not look anything like a $19 bowl AT ALL. Sorry, but the lack of apologies and poor recovery from a lousy customer experience is turning me off. Will not recommend to friends
4
The food was top quality - I had a seafood pasta which really tastes of the freshness of the produce. My table also ordered the pappardelle which was good, and the pulled pork grain bowl. The grilled broccoli was a tad over salted but tasty.Deco was eclectic and service was prompt and helpful.Seating is a bit tight but we did bring along a baby. Would go back again though it is bit high in terms of expense
5
Hip cafe. Grain bowls and donburi were fantastic. Seafood linguine's lobster bisque sauce tasted synthetic. Didn't think much of the sticky date pudding... Much too sweet. Buckwheat pancakes also looked better than they tasted. A little tight fisted with the maple syrup. But the coffee, oh the coffee... In a class of its own! Had to have 2 cups! V crowded fr 12nn on, reservations a must
5
Big yummilicious menu from brunch, burger, pasta and delish waffle w/ soft serves Coffee was good but too small to really enjoy it However, we tried walk in the Saturday before. Sent my daughter first while I parked, somehow she was only told to wait outside without putting our details on waitlist. So, after about half hour waited starvingly, I went in to check and had to be put on waitlist all over again!
3
We waited for awhile despite having a reservation, same for many of the other customers. Long wait, place too cramped, they provide baby chairs, but obviously there isn't space or a place safe to place the baby. Food was good though, but experience was not good. Also quite pricey for a 1.5 hour experience like that
4
The food is not bad although the dark chocolate sundae is a little over the top.
My friend noted that the patrons seem young and hip, so its probably a hippie place with decent food options.
4
very lively cafe, the food is great, creative. Super donburi and we also like the Indian style sandwich. The staff is fast and smiley.
5
The Populus cafe ambiance was great, the decor is quite modern. The dishes were quite fusion to me. The service was good but if they could take order from the table rather than ordering yourself will be even better. The food were really tasty and rich. For first visit, I would recommend to order a few sides and share so that you can get to try more dishes. The price were around the same as the cafe around this area. This cafe is usually very packed during lunch time, is best to make reservation before heading down to avoid disappointment
3
There's no doubt the food here is good and attention to detail with presentation makes the dishes visually appealing. My issue is that you can't make any amendments to the menu, so as a vegetarian you pretty much have one or two choices of savoury food, otherwise you have to have something Super sweet like pancakes, French toast, waffles, etc. The food I've had is always nice and place has a great vibe, but it's not cheap. I would choose the Lokal which is next door over Populus any day
3
Worth visiting Populus Coffee and Food Co for a quick and healthy lunch - I'd recommend their roast chicken grain bowl. The service was a bit slow - we reserved a table in advance but nothing was actually kept aside for us when we showed up. This was after reconfirming our booking a few times that morning. After waiting for a while we had to ask the waiter for some menus and water for the table. Not a great start to the meal. However, the food is lovely and the elder flower soda was nice, so worth a visit. Quantity was just right, though someone with a bigger appetite might need a second dish
4
Populous is a bit confused wish it was slightly better as its right next door to our office and would like to go more often but I normally leave frustrated, have flat out stood and walked out before, here's why.When you enter you are treated and taken to a table and handed a large wooden menu.You then need to go and que up to make your order where unless it's over 50 dollars needs to be cash.This annoys me and puts me off the place.Food is expensive but it's damn good, the pork belly sandwich is my favourite and the coconut smoothie is amazing the bowels are also good.Little details let it down, coffee is good though takes an unacceptable long time to arrive normally after the food, they provide bottles of water but not cold ones.Seems to be let down by little details. With the excellent lokal 2 doors down and the level of quality of cafes in Singapore and in duxton in particular these guys need to work harder to get it right
5
We had a late brunch/early lunch on a Monday. The locale is delightful, the coffee is top-notch, the food is beautifully presented, tasty). When we arrived 11:55AM the place was half full, but by 12:30PM it was full.THEY DO TAKE CREDIT CARDS (but not American Express)Like everything in Singapore it is expensive (pancakes with fruit US$15, cappuccinos are US$4.20), but also like everything in Singapore it is top quality
3
We visited on a Sunday afternoon. We tried to make reservations the night before but they were full. On arrival, the place was packed. We were told to wait 15-30 minutes but thankfully there was a counter seat which we were happy to have, so no waiting. We had the Populus scrambled eggs, pulled pork bowl, piccolo and flat white which came up to about 50 bucks. I really enjoyed the mains as they were plated well, and very tasty. The scrambled eggs came piled on a croissant which was light and moist. I especially enjoyed the pulled pork which consisted of quinoa, barley, generous amounts of pork and a good variety of vegetables though I wished there were more greens.The coffee was mediocre. It wasn't bad but it was more acidic than we prefer so we'd hop over to Nylon for coffee instead.The service was inconsistent. On one hand, the staff were friendly. On the other, they didn't seem to anticipate customers' needs. Case in point, a waiter came by with a set of fork and knife, and fork and spoon. He asked who was having the bowl. When I said we were sharing, he just left the cutlery and left. I would have expected him to return with another set of knife and spoon but he didn't and I had to request for it when the food was served.I'd return for the pulled pork bowl
1
Came in to get two coffees to go at 5pm. And we waited 15 minutes for our coffees while just standing there. Well, it had better be a good cup of coffee. It wasn't. Trust us, we've been here for the food as well. Takes an equally long time to come, and nothing great. This review was typed while waiting for two cups of unimpressive coffee
5
There are plenty of new cafes here in singapore that actually give you good coffee now. Populus roasts their own coffee (number 5) and their house blend Monolith and others are actually quite good. Their staff are good at making the coffee too. Quite slow at it though. The food is overpriced but damn good. Simple but they use fresh and good quality ingredients. Their menu good do with a few meat-free options though, but otherwise is pretty good. They do a range of filter coffees and espresso blends also (when in stock) and syphon etc etc. Their stuff are pretty well trained and the service is generally quite good (rare here in singapore)
