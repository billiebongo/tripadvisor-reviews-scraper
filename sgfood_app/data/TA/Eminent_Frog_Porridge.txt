Though a bit pricy at $8.50 a froggie, it is one of the best i have eaten so far. In fact it is better than the popular Geylang Lor 9 Frog Porridge. Ordered their spring onion frog in claypot. Will definately return here for moreeeee

The whole reason why we were in Singapore was because of my constant craving for frog porridge since May. Seven months later, we made it to one of the most famous restaurants - Eminent Frog Porridge ! We thought their special home-made chill sauce would be super spicy and savoury so we ordered one pot to share but in hindsight should have settled for the spring onion instead. This sauce was not really spicy and too tomatoey for our liking, not the thick dark sauce that I was craving for. Frog legs were very plump and juicy though, it was the bf's first time trying frog and now he's hooked . We also loved the porridge, it was smooth but we still could feel rice grains against our tongues. Would definitely come back for the green onion sauce next time, this time was not satisfied enough

Supper at my favourite claypot frog porridge in Singapore. Ordered both the dried chilli (宫保) and white pepper versions and they were excellent. Mixing with the gooey fragrant porridge is how I like it and is an uniquely Singaporean taste.I am seeing a lot more Japanese and Chinese tourist recently

Every other month, i will crave for frog porridge. There's a few different stores that sell but i only fancy Eminent Frog Porride located at Geylang Lorong 19. My favourite flavour is the white pepper. But tonight i have craving for more spicy flavour, hence ordered the Gong Bao. 2 frogs and gets 1 free. Their other dishes are good as well! Tonight dinner for 2 only costed $26 which we had 3 frog legs in Gong Bao flavour, a sambal kang kong and a small pot of porridge

Parking is an issue so do come early or for late night supper. Waitress here are mostly from China, Msian and Vietnam. Waitress are abit impatient though. Drinks and food are paid separately. They have a few pricing. 2 frogs for $13. If you want their "promotion" buy 2 get 1 free then it's $16. Basically you are paying for the "free" frog.

During this entire trip in Singapore, we went on a food crawl binge and tried as much as we can. However, tummy can only hold so much.So this Eminent Frog Porridge as the name implies specialized in anything Frog.Indeed they were fresh and tender. We only tried the ones in the porridge, but the one that was cooked in soy sauce and garlic in a clay pot looked really good as well. Oh well, next time....Everything we had were yummy, will be back.

Went there at 7pm, almost full packed by hungry people. Just sit on the available seat even though the table hadn't been cleared yet :) soon the waiter came to clean the table and giving me the menu. Opted for frog with spring onions, a classic. They offered buying 2 frogs for 3, but I was not very hungry, so I went with that single frog and smallest portion of porridge available. Fast service, pots of dishes arrived shortly still bubbling hot. Turned out the porridge and the frog gravy alone were very tasty, not to mention that single large, succulent frog. Deep regrets having had to leave the porridge half finished, but at least I did the frog dish proper justice. Will visit again sometime

Famous among the locals and perfect for late night supper, the frog leg porridge is served piping hot in Claypots. A variety of frog leg Flavours are available, and reasonably priced. 3 of us spend $26.50 on 3+1 (order 3, free 1) frog leg porridge, 2 cokes and 1 lime juice. Less than $10 for supper, good deal.Do order more if you have a huge appetite, the 2 Tiny legs of the frogs are more edible than its bodies. For those who are new to this, it tastes similar to chicken.

Geylang is full of good restaurants. One of these is Eminent frog porridge restaurant.Like a name says place specialities are frog porridges. If you like frogs you must try Eminents menu. Food was very good and service was nice and quick. They doesn't sell any alcohol

We had walked a long way to this location and we had to waited about 15-20 minutes to eat frog porrigde. But the frog porrigde very delicious and the waiter friendly as well. I think if you come to Singapore you should try here very good frog

Was approached by stall assistant and recommended their signature frog legs.They have the buy 2 get one free frog porridge. Food wasn't salty and tasted good. Do also try their beef hor fun which is just as good

I always come back here to eat porridge and chilli grab. Food is good, staff always fast and can speak many languages Eng, Chi, Viet,.. Price is reasonable. But not very clean due to many guests in and out.

A special delicacy for guys especially those who have weak legs. You'l never know how it works in you unless you really try it.

Great great food if you don't mind something a bit expensive, very very slow. If you are starving then probably not the best place but if you can wait and pay a bit great food here

The frog meat is very tender and tasty, porridge is very smooth. Must try the spicy ones. Tried others but none can be compared to this, not even near. Recommended. Staff service can be better though. Other dishes also very nice.

Better go on an empty stomach, because when you leave this place, you will be BURSTING with food. The frog porridge is simply divine. It is pity I have a "small" stomach or else I would want to try and devour more dishes.A good place, but go early (like 5pm) for dinner, or else you will be waiting quite long time for your food to come. The queue is madness

Geylang may be red light district, but it has 30's architecture, THE atmosphere & frogs are local speciality. This was our first night in Singapore & we were too tired to venture far.Eminent Frog had all signs of good food - type of street eatery, full, delicious smell & food looking good.So we got brilliant spicy frog with white pepper & garlic -spicy sauce, succulent frog, should have taken porridge with, but my wife prefers rice. Simply brilliant. Take 3 pay for 2.We also took medium prawns in sweet-nutty satay. The sauce was delicious. Prawns a bit overcooked & rather difficult to eat as in shells - no napkins to clean fingers. But the taste overall very good.Fast service, you pay on serving so no time wasted.I hope rest of my stay in Sing will be as good ;

This is a review I should've done long time back. But the memory is still vivid: it was 6:30 pm my flight landed in Singapore, checked into the hotel on Orchard BLVD, then I got to this place at 8:30 pm -- really couldn't wait after seeing so many reviews whilst planning my trip. Wow, it did not fail me, fresh and tasty frog with perfectly cooked porridge. Got both spring onion and the chili frog and tried to mix them together for a new flavour. I was sweating like in shower but just can't stop! Like their veggie as well.Well, mouth-watering again when writing this review. Can't wait to go back

This is the place that I always visit when I go to Singapore.The restaurant is in Singapore Red District. Don't expect fine dinning experience. They even don't have air conditioning. It's only simple table, chair, and GOOD FOOD, accompanied by live atmosphere in Geylang.Despite the place, the food is GREAT !!! The porridge is hot, soft and not too watery, and the frog meat is well marinated and juicy. I always order Frog with dried chili (kung bao). They served the porridge and the frog separated.Please take MRT, align at Aljunied MRT (exit A), and walk around 10 minutes to the restaurant (lorong 17). Use Goggle Map if you need it
