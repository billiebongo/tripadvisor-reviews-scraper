affordable and extremely nice and moist muffins! chocolate & blueberry muffins are my favourite! been eating this since it opened for probably 10 years and still the best muffin around!

Freshly baked muffins that are so absolutely delicious that you cannot help but want to finish them while they are still hot! There is another branch in the Thomsom area.

Cheap for just a little over Singapore dollar a muffin. I like the chocolate chip and banana walnut. But the muffins tend to taste alike after a while.

My friend told me those were the best muffins so I got to try them.Loved the muffins with the dried fruits, but the double chocolate muffin somewhat disappointed me.Therefore only 4 stars.Would still recommend this shop,but not the double chocolate muffin ;

I would like to have these daily for breakfast please. Watch me, just WATCH ME get fat. I loved these so much that before we left, I went to buy more for the fambam for the next day's breakfast. Assorted Muffins are priced at $1.30 onwards, which I find insanely reasonable because these are very sizeable muffins, & they are not only delicious but also fluffy & moist. This should be the standards for muffins everywhere! I'm not going to talk about the individual muffins we ate (Chocolate Chip which we got to bring home, Banana Walnut, Orange Peel, Blueberry) because this really depends on your personal preference of what flavours you enjoy. I liked them all! Look out for the little sheet of paper (i.e. their menu) on the left side of the stall to check out what they have available & their respective prices ☺ Not pictured: Pandan Chiffon Cake which was WHOA moist & decadent. Not too sweet either. My mum & sis enjoyed the Banana Chiffon Cake I bought home for them, too. I guess everyone is a fan, now.Ps: Chocolat 'N' Spice actually has 3 outlets in total - Shunfu Mart (#02-12/13), Telok Blangah (Blk 78B St 12, #01-27) & Tanjong Pagar Plaza (#01-18). I've been to the first 2 ☺

Never noticed this little hidden- gem even- though passing by that area frequently, until I read about it online. It is a small shop with 4-5 staffs, selling freshly- baked muffins. Most of all, it is cheap, big and delicious. There are more than 10 variety of muffins and there are 2 other branches in Shunfu and Telok Blangah

Honestly, I’m not a big muffin fan. I don’t hate muffins, but I don’t love them either.These coffee walnut, mocha and chocolate chip muffins at Chocolat N’Spice are rich and tender, high-rising, and deep coffee and chocolate colour respectively. Bursting with flavours with a light, airy and cakey crumb, these really are amazing.Very enjoyable with just the right amount of sweetness without being overbearing. Again, great size and not at all dry!As it turns out, I do enjoy muffins. Fresh Chocolat N’Spice Muffins. This is the true truth as I say it as it is

I patronise the one at Shunfu Mart. Not a sweet tooth but it's ok for me. Long queue on weekends1

Smells fantastic, you can even keep it for a week or so (in the fridge), just pop them into the microwave for a few secs and wa-la, taste freshly baked. MUST TRY: Double Choc, Cheese,Banana Walnut
