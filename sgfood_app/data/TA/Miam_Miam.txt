Nice atmosphere to hangout with friends after a day of work. Interesting experience trying out the onsen egg and mushroom soup. Pasta serving is decent too.
5
Service staff were very friendly and patient with the customers, and most importantly, food was great! Definitely a place to visit:)
5
The food and dessert here are good! Staff was friendly and responds well to our requests. Will come back here again!
3
The service and ambience is quite nice and cozy. Food choice is not bad but taste was average, not fantastic, but worth a try.
5
Good staff patient in explaining. Food was nice too served fast. Staff also told us about current promotions which was good.
4
Pros :
+ Excellent taste
+ Bundled with drinks and salad/soup is good value
+ My partner absolutely loves the chocolate souffle
Cons :
- Dessert is rather overpriced.
- French Toast is ok, but egg and milk taste could be stronger.

My first Miam Miam dining experience with my wife. Both of us ordered spaghetti, the food was just meeting the average standard. Can get better one elsewhere.
4
Excellent food. But the wait for the food was pretty long which can be improved. Buzzer on the table to call for service was good.
3
Miso salad was goodPasta was average. My friend had carbonara while I had crab aglio olio which was one of their signature dishes. Both were a bit dry and bland The soufflÃ© chocolate pancake was good. Very rich but not too sweet. Banana caramel pancake was average. The pancake had an artificial banana flavour. Service wise was good. Waitresses were very attentive.
4
They called me in advance to confirm my booking which is good. Had a long table set up for around 20pax which is nice and allow us all to sit together and chit chat. However, the food took 20-30min to serve after ordering. I guess it is because of lunch hour rush with almost full house of guests. Nonetheless, the quality of the food is still awesome.
4
i was greeted with a warm smile, treated with respect and sincerity by all the employees of the restaurant
4
Had a fuss free reservations and no issues in the booking.
But I bought a $50 voucher frrom Chope. But I have not receive any notifications and how to redeem? Why is this so?
4
Visited with two friends for lunch and I got the Crab Mentaiko Pasta and Vanilla Soufflé.
Food was really great and pasta was well cooked and so was the Soufflé.
The service staff were really efficient and well mannered too.
3
Pleasant place with efficient and friendly service. However, it would be appreciated that the menu gets more regular revamps so that we, as regulars, can be more excited about the food.
4
The miam miam spaghetti is their recommended pasta on the menu - a butter/shoyu based dish. quite an interesting try but there are better pastas out there
4
Had a surprise lunch birthday party for 10 at the restaurant. Staff were helpful with coordination. Food was delicious, interesting pasta choices. The deserts were superb, both souffle and pancakes were delicious.
5
The rice is a bit oily but overall, the rice and pasta and desserts were great!! A little note: The desserts required about 25 minutes of preparation, as told, so the staff advised to start preparing. Although the desserts came about the stated time, we were not 'ready' as we just finished the mains. If you don't mind wait, you should ask them to prepare at least half way into your mains
5
My girlfriends and I visited Miam Miam to throw a baby shower for one of them. We were given a nice cozy booth for ourselves and the waiters were very attentive to all our needs. The lobster bisque pasta was to live for and the desserts were amazing as well.
4
Went with my colleague and we ordered the lunch set. Should have checked with the staff on the terms and conditions of using the chope vouchers... They were not applicable for set lunches. However, the food was, as always, good. My colleague said she will go back again and try the lobster pasta! We had chicken teriyaki and miamiam signature pasta. With the set came tomato soup which was nice too! A bit on the salty side but still delicious. The early grey tea was quite horrid. Regretted topping up $2 for it. Haha.
3
Had tried spaghetti (but was too stiff). The baked rice was fulfilling. The souffle is good but I was more satisfied with the pancake that has an ice cream with bananas and blueberries. The ambience at the Westgate outlet is the best as compared to Bugus and Tampines One
4
Squid ink rice tasted soooo good! However,the hand drip coffee tasted acidic which was not to my liking and the mushroom soup was bland and diluted on that day. The service was good that could be compensate for the expensive dinner
3
Restaurant atmosphere is alright. But the food is not particularly enticing and the price is be rather high. But they do have a lot of promotions.
3
Food standard seems to have dropped since their first debut. The french toast didnt have that wow factor anymore. Nevertheless great service and nice ambience made it a gd experience
5
I was taking the outside seat of the restaurant. Nice soothing music and I like to see the children's rain passing by. Was a relaxing experience.
5
Friends meet up and environment was good for catching up. Food met a decent standard and staff were all friendly.
4
As this is near where I stay in the west, it is my go-to restaurant to unwind or meet friends. Wish they could revamp their menu items more regularly though. But I could always count on the service staff for efficient and friendly service.
5
Come here if you like nice food, and more importantly prompt service from crew. No fuss experience! The atmosphere is great too.
5
so far good， nice enviroment ，and friends staff ，food nice overall good ，worth to eat ，and will go again
5
standard of food remain the same as i have been dining at miam miam for more than 2 years now, they never fail to disappoint me
4
Ordered the mentaiko crab squid ink pasta and pork donburi and both dishes were great!! The pork was extremely well marinated. For dessert, we had souffle pancake (original) and it was one of the best I've ever tasted!!! Ambience and service was great too. Just that it was an open-kitchen concept and we smelled quite bad after the meal. Overall everything was good and will definitely come back especially for the souffle pancake!!!!!!
4
The food was good. The atmosphere was good. Good for chatting with friends. Recommended for casual dining.
4
Miam Miam is a very cozy atmosphere for friends n even couples. Love the fusion main dishes n the pastries like soufflés. Service is very good n staff are very helpful n friendly. Will definitely go back again !
5
the service staffs were very attentive, and the food portion was rather big. however the pasta was abit blend. fantastic dessert! overall, it was a good experience.

Had an enjoyable meal at Miam Miam with friends! I have ordered the seafood cream pasta and the gravy is so delicious!
4
i was greeted with a warm friendly smile and was treated with fast efficient customer service by the staff.

Restaurant has a nice ambience especially for a gathering with friends. Food was appealing and nice. Overall pleasant experience.
4
Love to have my dinner at miam miam. Contented by their great food and the staffs are very friendly too.
4
Did not managed to try the dessert. Ordered Souffle De Nuage. For me their Souffle tastes better than Hoshino's (my preference).
Would definitely go again to try out their desserts
3
French/Italian/Japanese fusion food? Spaghetti range and souffle inspired desserts and main dishes. Had the souffle curry rice; poor value.. Only meat is a nondescript sausage and curry mixed rice in a souffle concoction. The seabass donburi my partner ordered has a bigger piece of meat but portion is on the smallish side.
4
Had dinner with friends on 26 Apr 2017..We were early and so we got the seats quickly. The restaurant filled up quite quickly by 8pm and it's 3/4 full which I considered as good during a weekday. Had the clams as starter before and we ordered the main pasta meal ~ Arrabbiata and Mentaiko King Crab (2). Yummy! The Creme Brulee is heavenly though! In comparison, chocolate soffule pales in comparison but we would rank it nice & worthy to try. For all that we paid, it's a very good meal. The service is good too although it takes around 3 rings of the table bell before the server would come to refill the water. Overall very good experience at this branch. Thanks!
3
Had dinner at this outlet for a family get-together. Food portions average and prices slightly high end. Food taste quite average - will not return as I prefer to try other options in Westgate Mall.
3
When dinner with friends and it was pretty decent there. Environment was nice. Service was ok but abit slow.
5
Loved the fish rice bowl thingy. Very well executed. Their desserts were super yummy as well. Also quite liked their decor
3
Good overall. Give the squid ink rice. It's quite special. It seems under staffed though. The waitresses are trying hard but clearly struggling to cope with the crowd
5
First time visiting Miam Miam. Love it. Food was nice. I love their food n service. will visit again soon
4
Nice food, ambience is chic and good service. The hot matcha green tea and the squid Ink dish is highly recommended. Will be back.
5
When the honey pour over on one of the friend from overseas, immediately the service staff brought over a stack of napkins without our request... Thanks Miam Miam for the great services!!! Tumbs UP...:)

Came here despite the long queue.Impromptu surprise dining. Been here several times to eat, the restaurant serves French and Japanese fusion food. food is always served warm and filled my belly happy. Prompt service, friendly staff and clean cosy feel environment. Liked their tomato soufflÃ© and curry souffle. The pancakes though are not as delicious compared to the ones at Hoshino Coffee.
4
Enjoyed the visit very much. Service was friendly and prompt and patient (we had a good table for 4/5 people, took some 30 minutes to settle down and finally place our orders, but everything was well). Mains were alright in taste and large in portions but can't say the same for the soups - blend and under-portioned.
4
Went on the 13 feb 17 with 3 collgues. Restaurant is clean and good. Pregnant Waitress was friendly and lead us to our table. Food has many varieties. Order 3 type of main course. Food portion was adequate . Drink was good. Service overall was good from the other staff. Average cost per person is $30.
