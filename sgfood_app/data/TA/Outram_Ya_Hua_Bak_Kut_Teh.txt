Have been many times. Authentic still.
S$40 for two. 2 bowls of BKT ribs. Tofu. Rice. Tea. Kidney/liver. Good peppery soup. Quality a little deteriorated compared to before. Meat was not so super great. But overall still good rating.

Came here for lunch and love the clear soup here. The pork ribs are also nicely cooked. There are ample seats here as well.

Famous Singapore style Bak Kut Teh with pepper based soup. A local gem, where people gather for breakfast and lunch. Selection of pork meats including meat from loin, rib, back bone and others. specialties also include pig tail, porcine liver and kidney.The soup was aromatic and one can finish few bowls of rice eating with it

Tourists arent goin to go here. It's too legit. But if you are local, or looking for tje real at any hour, go down by the port. 9 sisters can't be wrong.Tea lovers, you got the choice to BYO or have boss lady sort out the leaves for you. Pull up a gas stove and catch a rolling boil. Order bah kuh teh. Teh = Tea. TIL

The Store opens till very late, so it is an excellent place for supper. Open and spacious seating area. Relatively easy parking, so driving would not be an issue. The soup is peppery, so it's not for those who aren't good with pepper. Unlimited soup, which is definitely a plus. Excellent and fast service. There are staff practically stationed just to help top up your bowl with extra pipping hot soup. They have a fish slice option for those who don't feel like having pork. I would personally recommend the $10 bowl to be the most value for money. The side dishes for this place aren't particularly exceptional. Place isn't considered that cheap either, but is reasonably priced.

Been here for countless times whenever I was in Singapore. Seriously though the bak kut teh/ rou gu cha (however you named it) here have been, is and probably will still be my all time favourite bak kut teh place ON EARTH. the bak kut teh here is one that's made with white pepper so it gave off a really clear colour and a very distinct peppery scent (which i love!) you can have bottomless refill of the soup too! I think my personal record was having my bak kut teh refilled 8 times. you will not be disappointed. well assured

Happen to stumble on this shop during my weekend cycling trip.Restaurant location is not quite accessible to MRT train stations and its at the PSA harbour area. The shop front is quite unassuming. The stall takes half of the coffee shop and the other half has other foods served like Zi Char. The BKT is quite delicious. Food quality is good. The staff is very attentive and helpful.Had mee suah, pigs stomach, BKT and other side dishes. Prices are reasonable.Cleanliness is not that great. As long as you can overlook this, you won't be affected after tasting the food.Happy eating

I know there's this whole debate on which bah kut teh is better - the Klang version (MY) or the Singapore version. Being a visitor to both countries several times each year and coming from a country with quite a healthy love for pork (PH), I think I can comment on this to some extent.I like the Klang version for lunches - it's not soupy and not a broth per se, it's more of a stew or a braised pot than anything, and makes me think of Chinese-style adobo in the Philippines (heavy soy tint in the sauce but herby/sweet umami unlike local Philippine adobos that just use salt, pepper, garlic and bay leaf and have a salt/sweet umami). This makes this great for on the go packed lunches, topped on rice.The Singapore version is a rib in a white pepper broth, almost clear, but with globules of fat and garlic floating all around. Paired with some boiled peanuts, some youtiao, and a bowl of rice. I've ried Founder's (which i like), the one in Old Tiong Bahru (which to me lacks the peppery punch of Founder's), and this one, Outram Park Ya Hua Rou Gu Cha (not bad at all). This is perfect for late night meals, or on a rainy afternoon or evening.So depending on your craving or the weather or the time, you can choose between the two.I like the one here in Outram Park Ya Hua because: 1) service is SNAPPY (as in); staff are extremely helpful and keep on coming back to refill your bowl with the broth (or as it actually is - pork rib tea); 2) the broth is flavorful enough (not as peppery as Founder's, but when paired with the peanuts and some hoisin sauce, come together nicely); and 3) I know they are open to as late as 2 am, which makes it a perfect place to dine in after a heavy round of drinks and you need some nice hot broth to take away the buzz. I give Founder's the top rank because their rib is fork-tender. Outram Park's was not as tender as Founder's and made me feed a bit of the cro-magnon inside of me.It's cheap, and really bang for buck. I was so full, I had to walk from their store in Keppel Rd. to my hotel on Havelock Rd. just to take off the bloated feeling. All at 2 am.All in all, I'd do this again. In fact, since discovering this, I go here everytime I visit Singapore. Till my next visit

Last Christmas holiday, I had a fantastic trip with my friends Izzie go Singapore. Singapore’s food culture consists of Chinese, Indian, Malaysian and Indonesian influences. Both of us liked eating very much. Thanks to Internet, we found an abundance of restaurant suggestions and tips from Singaporeans and even non-Singaporeans. The most recommendation was Bak Kut Teh (肉骨茶). Outram Park Yahua Rou Gu Cha is the best choice. The restaurant is open air, on the patio of a complex, and we spent some time to find it. I ordered a bowl of the lean ribs bak kut the, the taste is pretty good. I think the tasty was a little like mom-cooked. And the price is cheap

This is a longtime haunt for Singapore Breakfast. Their Pork Rib Soup is super tasty and the tea and fix ins reminds me of the old time Singapore of Colonial. All this for under $15/person. You will go back for more. Reminder that there is little air-conditioning so sit near the fans…good luck and enjoy

Good Chinese Pork Ribs Soup aka Bak Kut Teh. Ribs are cooked just right and the unlimited soup is superb.
However, it is also relatively expensive.
Side dishes not just average.

Soup is good. Quality maintained over the last few years. The braised beancurd and beancurd skin is good. Lunch or dinner, they never fail to satisfy our cravings for a good hot bowl of ba kut teh.

Their bak kut teh has very nice peppery soup and it's full of flavor. I also always order their kidney and liver soup which great too. Their braised beans are warm and delicious. Great service as well!

The bak kut teh soup is heavily loaded with pepper. There is choice of rib or slice pork soup. Always seen this place mostly crowded on weekdays lunch and went in on Sunday early evening last week. Was not crowded bit more people streaming in later even on Sunday nigh

Travel guidebooks usually recommend this eatery for one of the must-try food in Singapore - Bak Kut Teh. I had tried this eatery twice before and observed a drop in quality and service this time.I ordered bak kut teh and pork tripe soup this time. To my understanding, soup would be refilled for once if pork ribs/tripe remain in bowls. However, the staff hasn't provided refill ours this time while there were no many customers. This disappointed me much. I won't give it another shot next time I visit Singapore.There are many other options in the city which has better services and environment for enjoying the meal

I came here many years ago and remembered that the pork ribs here were truly amazing! (And the floor is very slippery...oily)Recently, I got to eat there again and was so looking forward to it...but was a little disappointed.Don't get me wrong the food is still good, but I think I can also get the same elsewhere. Pork on ribs was tender, soup is flavorful, but somehow it didn't impress me as much as when I last visited. They still refill the soup for FOC, but most BKT places you go to do that as wellBeware that if you do not want the bowl of fried doughstick and wet towels they slap on your table when you take your seat, you have to tell them immediately and remember who removed them. I had a little trouble trying to identify who removed the wet towel and the server didn't quite believe that I didn't hide the towel in my bag...I don't think they charge a lot for that (20 cents?) but still, I didn't take them as I prefer my own)They open till very late and I think are closed on Mondays.The prices are rather steep for a meal at a coffeesho

I always frequent the sibling owned Rou Gu Cha which is pretty near to this stall here and the usual stall I visted, was probably the best. Now, so why do I eat here? I wanted to give it a try and see how it fare against my best BKT place.First of all, how tasty the food is all boils down to the soup and the pork bone. When the soup was first brought to me and my friend, it taste pretty good, not too peppery, no pork smell, and garlic wasn't over powering the soup. However, the taste of the soup surprise us every time our soup was refilled! We had two refills and all three time, the soup taste totally different, it is as though they have multiple pots of soup and refill the soup based on how many time you had asked for it.The salted vegetable wasn't as nice as the one near havelock road, it taste a little too salty and wasn't as tasty.Otherwise, everything were great
4
I should begin by saying that I frequent the place because it's near my workplace. However, cleanliness needs improvement. I saw huge rat running across the place. Soup is peppery and pork ribs are soft and succulent.Should try the peanuts and salted veggie as well

A local took me here. And according to him, this is one of the two best Bak-tuk-teh in Singapore! Be ready to choose from a long list of side dishes and all the tea that they offer (As you choose, you will have to fill in a form and give it back to the waiter. If you go with a local who know Mandarin, he will make it faster and easier). But if you are a new-comer like me, choose ribs and soup first, then some plain rice, salted peas, fried-breadsticks, and finally order some salted vegetable because this food will be very high-cholesterol-ist ;). The soup was amazing and peppery and what's good about this eateria is that they offer free soup as you eat. So off we go, hungry boys! :DMy recommendation to eat this when it occasionally get cold in Singapore (which happens very rarely). Be ready to walk for a kilometer if you get off the Outram Park station. But the walk paid off

Pork Bone Soup in its literal translation. This is the locals' favourite and it is different from the Malaysian version. We're not going to discuss who started it, it's a neverending discussion. The Singaporean version is peppery and clearer than its counterpart across the Causeway. This area is also not that convenient if you don't drive. The nearest MRT station is about 1km away. Make sure to order tea and some side dishes as it is a high cholesterol food
