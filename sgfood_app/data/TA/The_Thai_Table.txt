I had a Thai green curry with plain rice, and have to admit that its one of the best green curries I have ever had outside of Thailand - especially considering the price. This will be my go-to-place for Thai food in the area.

We have patronised this restaurant many years ago. The foods then are delicious. As we are near to the restaurant and wanted something to spice up our dinner, we dine at the Thai Table.We ordered the following dishes:1) Tom yum seafood soup2) Pineapple rice3) Spicy Kang Kong4) Thai fish cake5) BBQ Chicken6) Claypot toufu with broccoli I must comment that the tom yum soup was delicious, follow up Kang Kong and BBQ Chicken.The pineapple rice come with sufficient cashew nuts, pork floss and 2 prawns. Dismayed, I believe the pineapple rice was precook as it's barely lukewarm. The fish cake are dried and tasteless, this is one of the worst fish cake I had tasted.Lastly, the Claypot toufu with broccoli. Ordered this dish specially for our little girl, she ate the broccoli. She spat out the toufu at first bite, we wondered if she was playing with her food. We tried the toufu and it's sour! Dismayed with the quality of food, we will never eat at this restaurant.

We had a really tasty green and red curry. Very Flavourful curries with lots of little eggplants , chillies and surprises hiding amongst the generous e chicken pieces. Very tasty and reasonably priced. The best Thai I have had in Singapore.We will be stopping by again before long

We were here for dinner on a Sunday night. Walk in and did not make any reservations even though the restaurant was quite crowded. Ordered the Olive Rice, Chicken Omelette, Green Pork Curry and a Kailan.The chicken omelette and Kailan came first. Texture of the omelette was excellent with the correct fluffiness but did not taste any chicken bits if they were there. The Kailan was ok. But we waited a long time for the olive rice. It should have been there together with the other dishes. The Olive rice was wonderful though. The curry arrived shortly but we were told that they ran out of green curry and they took it for granted that we would have the red curry. They should have at least asked. Nevertheless, the overall taste of the food was good even though the service leaves much to be desired. The 2 waiters tried and put in the effort but they were clearly under staff

Tried out The Thai Table and I am not disappointed. Am very pleased with the service and also the recommendations.The food is good and portion reasonable for Thai portion. It's also authentic yet can suit the local pallet.The place is cozy with warm light and nicely decorated. The price is also very reasonable for the quality of food and service.Highly recommended and do give it a try
