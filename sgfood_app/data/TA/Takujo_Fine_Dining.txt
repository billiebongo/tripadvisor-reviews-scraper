They have exotic sashimi and the food are fantastic. The price is on the expensive side and the customer service is up to expectation. Atmosphere is average consider the price that we are paying.

Must try their 3-box bento! i had their Gindara Mentaiyaki Bento. the Cod fliet was deliciously served with nice Niigata rice. ambience is great for a nice gathering or business lunch!

My third visit and the Foods quality remain good. The beef steak is my favourite especially when it’s medium rare.
5
Good food. My family enjoyed it. Although we took a bit of time to locate, the waiters did a good job looking after almost aspect. The food is well done. Price is as expected.

Tried the Gindara and beef yakiniku lunch bento sets, quality ingredients with very good Japanese rice too. Comes with miso soup and chawamushi as well. Service was attentive and staff are friendly. If you have membership for Emporium Shokuhin, you get rebates of 5% too by dining here

I have patronised several food outlets in Emporium Shokuhin, but it was the first time I visited Takujo Fine Dining. I did not have much to expect as the other outlets which I have visited were catered mainly for mass market with mediocre quality. To my surprise, this Japan restaurant was quite upmarket with quality food and reasonable pricing. Service was attentive and good.

First and foremost, I would like to say that it can be observed that the staff try very hard to serve us to the best of their ability but their lack of knowledge is not something that can be ignored.At the onset, we stood at the reception, constantly looking into the restaurant for nearly 10 minutes before we were attended to. The first employee was unable to understand that we have come for the Omakase menu and had to ask his colleague.The ambience was pretty good but air-conditioning was not strong enough to be comfortable throughout our meal. We also noticed that the whole restaurant was understaffed and was fully staffed by a Filipino team to which I would have no problem with if they could understand what normally goes on in a Japanese restaurant and anticipate the requests that its customers would make.The waiter attending to us keep pushing alcohol to us and even after multiple declines, he still continued. Although he was never rude to us, we found it a little annoying

Was quiet when I got there but filled up fairly quickly. Had the “Decadent” bowl which was very good. Service was fast and efficient at the beginning but slowed a little when the place filled up. Good venue for a business lunch if in the area

We dined here after reading the menu posted at the entrance of the restaurants. There were many enticing options, including an attractive seasonal menu. After we were seated, however, we found that almost everything we wanted to try was not available. It was frustrating -- to say the least -- for the server to have to say over and over: no, you can't have that, no, that's no longer on the menu, no that's not available anymore. Etc etc etc. The food we did end up eating was quite good, but we were still highly disappointed. So here's our rating: for the food we did have: 8. For the restaurant management: minus 10. Keep your menu up to date!! That should be a basic task of any halfway competent restaurant manager.

Visited here for lunch with my dad on a Sunday. Restaurant is relatively quiet and despite the posh interior you can dress pretty casually. There was a 1 for 1 sashimi platter promo which we took advantage of. Paid $78 for lobster sashimi and tempura with another platter of sashimi with 5 different types of fish (2 slices each).There are a variety of set lunches to choose from ranging from about $30-$45 which was very reasonable given the ingredients and serving size. The beef is excellent but I had it with a brown gravy which was too overpowering for my personal taste. Would still recommend trying the other sets
4
Ordered the A5 beef, the quantity is perfect for the price paid. Staff are attentive and it’s a highly recommended place for business meeting.
4
the lunch set is value for money. i find the beef too fatty, the sashimi is good and the overall experience is great!
5
Food is really great and fresh. It's beyond expectation and love to come back again in near future. Thank you.
4
Authentic Japanese food at great prices. Often very quiet as not many folks know about this place. Have a broad selection. Good value high quality sushi, Japanese steak, fresh oysters and even home made ice cream
5
Tucked away nicely in a corner of Emporium Shokuhin, Takujo is a great place to enjoy good food ad excellent service. The lunch sets are very worth it given the quality of the ingredients. Sashimi was fresh and absolutely delightful.
4
I love the seafood pasta, tiramisu and the crispy pizza . Service was great except the environment was a little noisy.
5
Food was great, staff was attentive! Also, I had made a comment in chope that it was my husband's birthday and they surprised us with a small cake! The staff also sang happy birthday. Great restaurant.

Given that I ordered the set dinner whereby each course was specified in sequence, I had expected the next dish to be served when I was done with my current dish. However, this was not the case and I felt as if I was being rushed to finish my meal. Otherwise, the ambience was good. Portion of the food was good as well.
3
Modern Japanese restaurant. Does not have he quaint charm of a traditional Japanese eatery. Omakase dishes were served in rapid succession, and the thrill of watching the chef at work and anticipating the next dish wasn't there. However, the grilled tuna cheek was spectacular. The best I've tried in Singapore.
4
Their service staffs were nice and prompt, Nelson was great as well putting efforts to make sure dishes are explained on it's origin when served and ensuring used plates are cleared. Food was good overall and some dishes are really worth trying such as sea bream slices and sashimi kaisen tartar
4
Service is good here. My kids love th beef dishes . The inaniwa udon is super smooth and the broth is delicious.
4
The restaurant is tastefully furnished in soothing dark colours and tables are sufficiently spaced out so there is privacy for diners. The sushi and sashimi is fresh and the quality is very good. Service is also attentive.
5
Food was good - like the tempura and crab meat inariwa udon.
Set lunch is alo value for money!
Service staff is also polite as attentive.
5
Not much on the menu as it was a fine dining place. Used their signature card and had their sashimi. Very fresh sashimi!
4
We booked because of the 1 for 1 sashimi offer. Has a great meal with sharing plates of sashimi and wagyu steak (level 5). And a bottle of house saki. Loved it

食材新鲜，器具讲究，营养搭配合理。
非常精致。
会为了那块鳕鱼和米饭，再去一次。
用餐环境清雅，安静。
唯一小遗憾是，价格小贵。
A real FINE dining experience, including the environment, the presentation and the food.

This is a nice quiet place for business lunch that do not want too much distractions. The food is authentic and delicious. But not cheap. A simple set lunch will set you back S$40 per person. But the service is excellent and the ambience is good

Takujo is tucked in the corner within Emporium Shokuhin. Boasting a mainly traditional Japanese menu it tries to set itself apart from the other more casual outfits within the Emporium. The service staff were attentive making the dining experience pleasant. The wagyu beef shabu shabu and the lobster sukiyaki were both deliciously satisfying. The sashimi platter was generous in portion and fresh. Given the image Takujo is trying to set for itself, the price point is also expectedly higher but not exorbitant. Overall a pleasant experience

We visited for dinner and chose the 8 course menu. Food was delicious, no doubt. The restaurant positions itself as fine dining but lacks in atmosphere and service. No lack in friendliness of staff but e.g. food was put on the table in a rather routine manner, without explanation or comment given. Also, the loudspeaker announcements made in the mall -think of "Could the driver of vehicle number ABC please approach the service desk..."; "Dear customers..."- are transmitted to the restaurant which ruins the atmosphere.All in all, too expensive for what it is and not quite the fine dining experience we had hoped for
3
Our group sampled a wide palette of dishes from the menu. The food was nice enough, but not fantastic. Service was generally good, but one of the guests had to wait 15 minutes for her dish, while everyone else had been served at the same time.
4
Good service and nice surrounds, this is part of a big complex called Emporium Shokuhin with an amazing array of food outlets and great supermarket with live seafood. Takujo is at the high end of the spectrum and serves excellent seafood flown fresh from Japan. Best days are likely Tuesday dinner and weekends when supplies come in. Boutique Japanese beef also on offer. Herbert will look after you like family. The respect for produce and doing as little as possible is evident

We had a weekday lunch and had the set lunches (tempura set, unagi set). The sashimi was delightfully fresh, the tempura was coated with a nice light batter and crisp to the tongue. Not many places have fresh prawns but we were glad to find out that Takujo is one of them. The unagi was really good and savoury. Loved the Japanese rice as well - good enough to eat it on its own, as it should be.The decor is tastefully done, low-key and classy. Liked the fact that it was also quiet, though perhaps that's because it was a weekday.The service was prompt, friendly and non-intrusive. The staff were accommodating and responsive, and made us feel very welcome. We are already planning our next trip...very soon

An awesome place for group lunches! This place serves authentic Japanese set lunches at very good price. I had the Kaisen Don Set, which comes with Selection of the dayâ€™s freshest sashimi in a sushi rice bowl, appetisers and inaniwa udon.The sashimi selections were really fresh and the appetisers were unique. Given the quality and portion of the food, as well as the ambience and service of the restaurant, the set cost me $28, which is very value-for-money.My other colleagues ordered the A5 Miyazaki Steak set and the live lobster sashimi and tempura set. All was good. Will definitely go back again
4
Priced at S$30 for the Kaisen Don lunch set that came with udon and 2 appetizers, Delicious it was and I enjoyed the meal. While the rice bowl may seem rather small, the amount of rice was just right. While it says fine dining, the sets are priced rather affordably. Will go back for the dinner omakase

I have lunch and dinner at Takujo recently. Food is fresh but the pleasant aftertaste that lingers in the mouth is missing. As a fine dining restaurant, the ambience is lacking. Service staff is polite but not very attentive and experienced. For dinner, we ordered a set which could have been a mistake. A little heavy for a Japanese dinner. The food was not served course by course. Have a feeling that the kitchen staff were trying to rush the customers through the meal. However I would like to mention that the lunch sets are very good and reasonably priced

A group of us booked a dinner with menu curated by the chef. 1. Japanese greens served chilled in bonito clear soup2. Day's freshest sashimi featuring Otoro, Chutoro, flamed Kinmedai with red vinegar jelly, Kampachi and Hotate.3. Crispy Crab Croquettes4. Flamed A5 Miyazaki Beef carpaccio5. 6 hour Braised Bluefin Tuna Head served with greens & Niigata rice 6. Genmaicha ice creamAll good! #2 was especially memorable for me because it was my time tasting vinegar jelly with sashimi. Vinegar jelly adds the omph and accentuates the flavour of the fish.#4 was my second favourite. Nicely raw. #5 was "wow" of the night. Fish with eyes as big as a sauce plate and flesh so smooth they easily glide into your throat. #6 sweet endings. I have no idea how they managed to csramelise one side of the cube of this brown rice ice-cream and it was so good

Emporium Shokuhin is a happening place now for Japanese food lovers. Dinner at Takujo was delicious, we had Sashimi set as well as Chutoro, wagyu & grilled tuna cheek. Sake selection is very good too ! Service was freindly & good despite a full capacity crowd of Friday evening. Continued shopping at Gourmet Grocer for more goodies. Glad to discover a place to have good food & gourmet shopping

Takujo@ Emporium ShokuhinLive lobster sashimi & tempura set- lobster served 2 ways - lobster with sashimi with Ikura in a light sauce; lobster tempura and vegetable kakiage, served with Niigata rice, appetiser and miso soup - like everything except the miso soup and it's only because generally I don't like miso soup. Lobster claw was cooked just right; not overcooked. Sashimi & tempura set - 3 types ofsashimi (including otoro), tempura 2 prawns and 3 vegetables, served with Niigata rice, appetiser and miso soup - fresh sashimi.Both small portions but for the price I'm not complaining. You can always add more food if a basic set not enough.Overall a pretty good meal

We enjoyed refreshing and creative seafood with the Omakase Set 2 and Ehime Sake Pairing Set meal orders tonight. The genmai tea ice cream ends the meal well.Their service was prompt with endearing smiles, we are happy we patronised.We will return for special occasions

Had my lunch at Takujo today with some of my colleagues. They have this wonderful set lunch that is really awesome. We ordered 4 sets and everything was awesome, especially the tendon set and the sukiyaki don set. Tendon comes with prawns, fish and vegetables in tempura and some sauce drizzled over it. The combination was marvellous. The Sukiyaki comes with Wagyu and their own sauce as well. the set comes with appetiser and miso soup. We also order a hamachi cheek which is grilled. The fish was grilled to perfection, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The food, combined with the great ambience and service was a great experience. i will definitely go back again
