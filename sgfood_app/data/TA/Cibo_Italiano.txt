You feel like you are in Italy eating this pizza. One of the best tomato sauces I've tried . Excellent burrata cheese. Not to be missed !

Cibo is a perfect place for casual dining. I have been there many times and am always very impressed with their friendly and attentive staff. The food is very consistent and their linguine vongole remains my favourite. Their yummy nutella tart completed my meal satisfactorily.

Would come again with friends and family. Love that it is walkable from our new place. Good discovery.

Still the best value and best margherita pizzas in town! Our family go to for authentic honest pizzas

I had 4 cheese pizza and it is delicious! There are a few other yummy options and we are spoilt for choices. Mussels in wine sauce is slightly on the salty side, but nevertheless, mussels are fresh and presentation is neat.Service is fast and efficient. I will definitely be back! Parking attendants are friendly, but the whole concept of mechanical parking is a slow painfulprocess, One has to wait for the machine to retrive the car, in future, I would rather park at Valley Point and walk over

I have ordered Cibo’s food with food delivery service since 2016. It was the 1st time to dine in Cibo with my wife and daughter. Even though Cibo is located at arcade in small condo with small size, its opened door bar types table setting always attracted me to visit here. Even though we sat inside, we could have outdoor feeling thanks to opened door. Food was even nicer than delivery for sure. While I liked high bar type chair and table, it wasn’t comfortable for my 3 years old daughter even thought they provided baby high chair. It was only missing part. Food, italian white wine and Italian craft beer were all excellent. We will try their lunch set soon during weekday as my office is located nearby Cibo.

Small and wonderful - I hesitate to write this review as I am afraid the next time we go there, there will be long lines waiting to get a table. We went there mainly because it has Italian groceries and I wanted porcini mushrooms, but we ended up with a great pizza, the best outside of, or maybe including, Naples. Our waiter, Sahari (sp?) was knowledgable regarding the mushrooms and of course, the menu, plus was personable and attentive, helping me pick out crema di porcini for my own cooking. But now I want to go back to try the rest of the menu, and we must hurry back as this small jewel will no doubt change from being a neighborhood hangout to a well known dining attraction.

I hate it when places like these have the cheek to levy a service charge. Piss poor service to Singaporeans but obviously more favourable to caucasians. What a joke.The food? Don't even bother. They entice you with lower prices but the pasta reeks of being frozen and reheated and the pizza was nothing to shout about.Best decision I made was to skip desserts. Give this place a miss
5
When we arrived, the place was already packed. Luckily, we made a reservation prior to coming. The staff was happy to direct us to our table. The high chairs weren’t comfortable but we didn’t mind at all as we were there to have good food and drinks while enjoying a good conversation. We ordered pizza, beer and gintonic. The pizza was really delicious. The staff was very attentive. The whole place made you feel warm. I would definitely come back and hopefully they will change the chairs to a more comfortable ones

This is just across the road from the Fraser suites and have to say my husband and I enjoy it. There is inside and outdoor seating. It's family friendly. And you can take your pet along to,lie at your table outside ..... the staff are warm and friendly. I love lasagne but very critical if it's not right. I have to admit it was delicious and tasty and very filling. Looking forward to going back again in march. grazzie Melli......

Average italian fare.
The appetisers can look for appetising, could have more rocket leaves . Dull looking.
Main course is average.
5
We like to go to Cibo just for a casual local dinner, I like the outdoor seating, friendly service and the food is always delicious.

Great pizzas, just renovated and now larger and more comfortable space. Friendly staff, makes you feel at home

This was a really nice Italian joint on river valley! Disappointed with freshness of Burata on pizza at dinner yesterday! Please don't loose your freshness

A favourite place to eat in Singapore. Outstanding food and drink, tremendous service and great vibe. Couldn't ask for more!

As keen as the waiter is to introduce us to all their promos, we find that the food quality is just not there. It might be their grandma's secret recipe but I just find the pizza sauce very blend. It tasted like they have just chucked a can of tomato puree straight on with much seasoning or creatively. It was awfully bland and little too acidic because there's nothing to balance it off. It was such a waste as the base of the pizza wasn't too bad considering this is Singpaore. The tartufo ravioli did have the pungent truffle smell but there's no trace of truffle and the pasta was also quite soggy with the overloading amount of sauce. Maybe they're just cheating with truffle oil. Not that great of an experience but I hope they can improve as the team seems to be welcoming and the location is not bad.Coffee was decent.
5
the restaurant service is really good friendly. we're 3 girls one men, he asked how many girls will be coming and put extra 2 chairs so we can put our bag and stuff before we asking ! and keep serve our wine and everyone is smiling while they are working. For Food Pizza is really good, thin and chewy and crust and fresh ingredients. Pasta also really nice. also the Dessert ! i definitely go back :)

The service was not great at the beginning. The servers did not give us menu nor serve us wine glasses (as we byo our wines) or water, we had to all for all the above.They have a 1-1 wine policy (meaning no corkage charge if u order another from them). The service only got better when we order our 2nd bottle of wine from them. Had some smile from the servers.Food was ok. Some hits & misses.....

We love this place and go there quite often Their mushroom ravioli and their burrata pizza are amazing. The house wine is excellent and at a reasonable price, considering prices Italian restaurants in Singapore. They also sell other provisions in the store imported directly from Italy. It is not super expensive and is of very high quality. I highly recommend this place for a casual night out

...I had in Singapore so far. It is not a restaurant, but a very uncomftable stool sitting overcrowded place. We ordered Pizza, Ravioli and Lasange. First they brought the wrong wine. Then the pizza, which was actually tasteless - it supposed to be a capriciosa (!). After my wife nearly finished we were still waiting for ours for about 25 minutes. Ravioli were too salty and the lasagne a slimy peace of flour. After finishing they just took one of our tables so I was sitting in the air. Finally, generously, there came a tasteless tiny cup of Tiramisu, with 3 spoons.I was wondering how this "restaurant" can even get one star
5
The set lunch here was delicious, especially the truffle ravioli. It was also a decent price ($15) for what is included: main course, drink & dessert. The service was great & the waiter was very accommodating, and it was a lovely lunch! Highly recommended
5
Great place at River Valley for drinks and italian food. Ambient atmosphere. The pizza we had was fantastic. Will visit again!
5
Best pizzas in town! I never ever order margherita pizzas ever but this most simple pizza here is the bomb!
5
Good food, nice menu but a bit pricey especially given no proper seating. Their bread, pizza and pasta are very good
5
The food is authentic and delicious, but the staff are the best. Alan is a real gem. My Favourite restaurant in Singapore!

Went on a rainy night and sat at the balcony seats. Very good diverse menu with an excellent choice of Italian favorites., Pizza oven broken on the night we were there. Check first if you want Pizza.

This is a casual bar with food. It's not a proper sit down restaurant. But that doesn't take away from the fact that the pizza is delicious! We didn't order any pasta but the dishes being served to other tables looked good. The wine selection and pricing is good too.
4
The restaurant was small but that's what made it a great experience. The service was personal and the food was delicious. We especially liked the ravioli argosta & granchio; the sauce was light but full flavored and you can taste the lobster and crab filling. The spinaci (battered-dipped spinach) was unique and I recommend you try that instead of the fires.

We visited 29thJan and we had bad experience. We ordered 2dishes of pasta. We thought their pasta was made from rubber. We were surprised that and we went to kitchen in the restaurant. We were surprised again because there were only one woman in the kitchen and she didn't use pan. She didnt cooking. Just heat up ready made dishes.

First visit: came in at 8 pm last Sat w/out reservation after a downpour. Place was almost full but was seated at last table on sidewalk, where about half the place's seating capacity was located. Despite the obvious bustle, was able to get advice to order. Menu was fairly limited but there was enough choice. We had a Rucola n Parma ham pizza and a Crab/lobster ravioli, 2 glasses of chianti n, shared a tiramisu. Pizza was very tasty and w a fairly thin base that was crispy. Topping was reasonable in qty and of good quality but just a little short of mozzarella. Looked too big for 2 to finish but we cleaned it up. Ravioli was good too. The Sicilian Datterino tomato sauce was very good and the filling was properly, quite delicately tasting of crab and lobster, but there were small bits of shell_not enough to complain about but enough to evidence use of real "meat." Qty was entre size more than main. Wine was a fair pour and of good quality for the price (Sgd 10.90 ea), which is also the price for Pinot Grigio and Montepulciano. Tiramisu was better than average. Judging by what others had, there were better choices we could have made, eg clams/clam pasta, slices of ham. The delicatessen antipasti offerings looked very good too. A neighbour at the next table had a plain tomato paste/pesto pasta and her son a lasagna. Both were happy. Our meal came up to Sgd 83/- not expensive considering the quality of ingredients and cooking. More than half the customers were Euro expat types and appeared to b repeat customers. A fair amount of takeaways for their pizzas. The place sells Italian grocery goods, eg, Pestos, Olive oil, wine, cheeses and hams. There are frozen/chilled foods you can take home and cook up yrself. I shld have tried their chocolate fondant.. looked good. All in all, a good find confirming other reviews and worth returning to for other dishes. Won't/can't rave more about it bcos there is another place like it but bigger and just as good, and the taste there is more robust, at HillV2.

Our family regularly goes to cibo italiano when we get a little homesick. The dishes are authentic Italian, the deli stocks genuine Italian foods and drinks and the atmosphere takes me back to my local osteria in Italy. Bravi ragazzi, keep it up.

Cibo is one of our Favourite Italian locals. The Staff were excellent and went out of their way to make our visit enjoyable. My boys and I had an excellent time. Thank you Cibo :-)

We feel happy that the place is just downstairs and we have frequently visited it. Good place for friends and couples. Very good pizza and staff are friendly and helpful. We like the spicy olive oil

This is a tiny street side cafe on River Valley Road with good Italian food, coffee and a choice of wines. Seating is limited. Good for a coffe break if you live close by.
4
Cibo Italiano is a very big surprise, itâ€™s a small family like trattoria along River Valley that has limited seating, which means that you need to arrive early before the regulars make their way, but the true highlight of the night was definitely the food. The crowning glory was the pasta dishes we ordered and the Cibo pizza served true to its authentic Italian style. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect Italian night. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon
5
By now, we tried almost every dish on the menu, and everything is great, be it pasta, pizza or dessert. The Osso Buco with Risotto Milanese was real good. A real nice and good place that unfortunately has a space issue. But still - our new regular Italian for casual and daily consumption. As wine is not so great (storage issue), we bring our own at a very fair corkage. Service great. Lovely place

We came for lunch and ordered the spaghetti bolognese and a spaghetti carbonara. Also a portion of truffle fries. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant which was chilled and nice and it came at a reasonable price range. The food is average at best but we didn't try other better known dishes like the pizzas and cheeses. Recommend to come for a chilled meal.
5
This is a combined Deli and Eatery, a good range of Italian Produce. Ideal for Al Fresco dining. The Host Simone is charming and friendly always remembering his guests and addressing them by Name. The Pizza and breads are cooked to perfection by Chef Angelina, she always has a smile and is happy to customize your Pizza.In addition to Pizza they have daily specials and a small a La Carte menu of delicious Italian favorites.Reasonably Prices Italian Beers and House wines.Highly Recommend this as an example of authentic Italian food

The food is great and my children love it. However this last weekend we went there (admittedly without a reservation) and the Asian guy there was rude and dismissive. No apology, no smile, no alternative time options. Just "we don't have place" and there were 3 tables empty with "reserved" place cards. I am sure they were booked out but surely a smile would ensure we would be back!All other times we have been there the owners have been great and the staff have been very helpful and smiling.we were a bit disappointed and left a bit cross at the staff's attitude
3
We went for lunch, and it turned out to be a very satisfying lunch. It is a small place, but we chose it as it was just a walking distance from where we were staying. We enjoyed our meal, and the service was very warm and excellent
5
wonderful experience both in food and service. Very Friendly and nice place.
absolutely i return back there.
4
Good food, good wine if you are looking for a little Italian this is the place to go. Small little restaurant on River valley Road. The food is awesome, well prepared, the service is good. Great place for a quick bite during the week. Enjoy.
5
Great Service, atmosphere and location.
Clean, Bright and Awesome Food!
Authentic Truffle Cheese! :D

Can get busy so do book. Fabulous local simple Italian dishes, real pizza, magic cold cuts n cheese at sensible prices. Great old fashioned family feel. Now hopefully regular sanctuary 😅

Cosy and casual with hearty Italian food! That about sums it up. Everyone feels comfortable here, sitting on high stools in an open small cafe. The service staff are friendly and casual. Other customers are dressed in shorts; one walks by with his dog to order a lasagne for pick up in 17 min time. The food is very good - Pasta is al dente with lots of olive oil on everything.
5
We came here for lunch and it was wonderful. - Burrata cheese sitting on top of a fresh rocket leaves bed. So fresh, soft, cheesy and yummy- Parma ham pizza + mozzarella artichoke pizza: Oh so fresh and yummy. very good quality parma ham - Lobster ravioli: beautifully done!The ambiance is comfy and cosy. It's unpretentious, honest, simple but delicious food. It's one of those neighborhood place where you know you can get a great meal from you favorite chef anytime! Highly recommended! I'd like to go back and try all items on the menu

Once again, I'm asking Trip Advisor for a "Good" rating. Saying Cibo Italiano is "average" is not being entirely fair, but calling it "very good" is a little over the top. You ask why? The atmosphere is really nice, good quality neighbourhood Italian, the pizzas were good, the more basic pasta was great, but some of the filled homemade (?) pasta fell terribly flat. The starters and snacks were simple and satisfying. So where was the big problem?I'll tell you: The wine selection. Though we were more than willing to fork out more for a decent bottle, there simply was nothing to choose apart from hard to swallow (and admittedly cheap) - dare I say it? - rubbish plonk. On the positive side, if you are one of those Trippers who like a good deal (i.e. cheapskate), you'll faint with pleasure. Five people, two white, one red, enough food for all and we didn't pass the S$500 mark.

the atmosphere is nice within the restaurant but i got take away twice from there because of the kids, i dint want these to spoil it. their pastas were so good i tried the seafood with cream sauce(customized) and the ravioli. were so good. margarita kids pizza was ok, but not as good as the level of their pastas
5
Didnt expect an Italian bistro to become part of my comfort food (I'm a Singaporean Chinese and we tend to crave local food). The owners knows their stuff well and prices has also kept me going back there. The relaxed atmosphere (getting a little crowded these days) makes the usual fine dining italian more worth while. Skip the deep fried stuff and go for the Burrata Cheese. Pizzas are freshly made and omg better than your NYC pizzas.

Cibo opened a few months ago. I would characterise it as a great local restaurant - excellent pasta (porcini ravioli) and pizzas, very reasonably priced food and drinks, friendly owners and team. Great for meals or a drink in the evening or a take away coffee. It is quite small so a reservation would be helpful. If you don't walk here you would need to park in the Valley Point shopping centre and cross the road.
