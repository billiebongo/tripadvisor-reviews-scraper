Staff was really attentive and personable, we celebrate a birthday and they made sure to recognise us by our name. Food was great too!

Dined on Chinese New Year Eve and was pleasantly surprised with their CNY specials. The server was professional to recommend their western Lou Hei which was refreshing and delish. Service is good and environment is homey.

Nice first time experience with this restaurant. Like the concept and ambience. Food was great with plenty of different pastas, pizzas and salads to choose from. Innovative smoothies and juice mixes with a difference. Will definitely be back next time we are in Singapore
5
Fantastic food with good customer service, the staff are friendly and we are so comfortable with the whole dining experience, we enjoyed our food whenever we dine there,is our favourite place to dine ! Must pay a visit
4
great restaurant, great ambience, great service and great food. will be back to this restaurant again, for sure.

We tried the prosciutto pizza and superfood salad and both were delicious. The lemonades were a good choice as well. The pana cotta was the best choice ever! The prices are quite high but worth it.The atmosphere in the restaurant is charming.We had to ask the waiters for the wifi code a few times but other than that it was a great experience.Would definitely recommend

Ate at Jaimie’s on Orchard Road in Singapore on a Sunday evening with our two young boys. Service was excellent, and the food was delicious. Really good (and healthy) options for the kids. The oxtail lasagne was a standout. Only criticism, it is a little pricey. $40 for a burger....
3
Did my birthday lunch yesterday with my families. We ordered Angus Sirloin steak, squid ink pasta, magherita pizza and a molten cake. The food was great. But while leaving the restaurant, I saw a self service station where you can serve yourself some bread while waiting for your food but we have not been brief or told. Also, during the reservation,we have highlighted it’s a birthday lunch. But nothing has done to make you feel you are welcome to celebrate in this restaurant. I wanted to rate 4 for the food but 3 for the service.

We had been to Jamie's Italian Forum on a couple of occasions on our last visit to Singapore and decided to dine here again as it wasn't too far from our hotel. It's certainly in a very good location on Orchard Rd - only a few minutes from the MRT at Ion Orchard and close to all the shops. It does get very busy so better to book in advance which can be done online if you like to plan ahead. There's a really good atmosphere in the restaurant...its noisy, vibrant and exciting. There is a very good choice of food and wine and the staff are friendly and efficient. The Lasagne with a rocket salad was very good with good portion sizes but the burger was a little disappointing in that the actual burger was incredibly dry and just fell apart. Wine is available by the glass if you can't manage a bottle! We paid just under a 100 SGD for two.Would we visit again when in Singapore...probably
2
Visited Jamie’s at VivoCity when it first open years back and wasn’t impressed with the food. However, a friend visited the restaurant at Forum and recommended to give it another try. Service was fast and waiters were attentive but the food was lousy. We had an aglio olio pasta, pizza, sweet potato fries and deep fried squid - nothing strikes as good. For the price you pay, I think I can get better Italian food elsewhere.
5
Good food, nice decor, good ambience, great service... most importantly, the portions are great, so we'll be back! (just a note to take care of that exhaust cos certain parts of the restaurant smells)
4
Staff were welcoming and accommodating. The burrata fell short of our expectations but the pizza was really good!
5
Good service, delicious food, make a booking to avoid disappointment. Will recommend friends to try.

Late lunch to fuel up after a busy day .
Quickly seated and served by friendly staff
Meal was a chicken salad - good portion and very tasty
All round good dining experience in a well set out restaurant
5
went for dinner with my friend to celebrate his birthday. the manager immediately realized i had a cake and offered to put it in the fridge. when the cake was brought out it was laid beautifully on the wooden board and had the birthday greeting written out with chocolate sauce. the food was good too, we had a risotto and a pizza. but i’ll give the extra points for the lovely evening to the service - throughout the evening the staff was very attentive and very friendly

Since we were staying just a stone’s throw from Orchard Road, we got to eat at several eateries on Orchard Road during our week-long stay in Singapore. Jamie’s was the first of them: we came here on our second night in the city. As in all the Jamie’s outlets I’ve been to, here too the ambience is warm and friendly, with wooden walls, pictures of ingredients, an array of Jamie Oliver’s cookbooks, and quirky bits of décor—on a glass window pane near us was etched a delightful and very Italian motor scooter. Our toddler was asked if she wanted a high chair, and was given it, followed by a little set of crayons and a picture to colour. There’s a kids menu as well (which, seeing Jamie’s involvement with the campaign for children’s nutrition, features healthy alternatives to several of the more popular dishes that most children seem to like). Our toddler wasn’t interested in the kids menu, so we ordered from the main menu, to share: a chicken liver pate crostini as a starter, followed by—as the mains—a wild mushroom risotto and an Italian style fish and chips. These cost us a total of S$73.85, inclusive of all taxes and service charges. The chicken liver pate crostini was a rustic form of pate on melba toast: toasted sliced bread, chicken liver pate, strips of crisp fried pancetta, a generous garnish of grated Parmesan, and a couple of leaves of fried sage. Very good.The mushroom risotto came with an assortment of mushrooms and herbs and was delicious, packed full of flavour and with the rice cooked just right, creamy yet with that little bit of bite at the centre. I loved this.… And I loved the fish and chips. Being Italian style, the chips were polenta chips, crispy on the outside and soft inside. The dip, instead of being tartare sauce, was a lovely mayonnaise with chopped dill, some chilli, and other stuff—I couldn’t tell what exactly, but it was subtle and excellent. The fish was fresh, and perfectly cooked, and the little accompaniment of mushy peas was nice
2
Jamie's Italian is a kind of Italian restaurant that offers poor price value in terms of food quality vs. price level. The food was below mediocre while the price level was very high even for Singapore. The staff was polite and helpful, but the overpowering smell of garlic was the final nail. Not recommended
3
We had lunch in this restaurantWe ordered pizza parma, creamy mushroom soup, apple juice and just water...The water did not arrived till we received the dishes and asked once againThe soup was good but the pizza missed mozarella cheese, the arugola leaves were not fresh and the taste was strange...We expected much more..
4
I am a big fan of Jamie Oliver, and had very high hopes for this place. I was always experimenting at home with his recipes and looked forward to dine with professionals who possibly cooked with this amazing chef. I ordered the starters and Bolognise and my date ordered the steak. The steak was pricey and the overall presentation was good. Taste wise, it was nothing to scream about. My pasta was very presentable, very insta worthy. However, the taste was not as expected. The Bologise at PS cafe is much better
3
You know what you are getting with Jamie's and this deliver. The food was tasty but service was poor. My main course arrived before I had had my starter !Went to pay by card and the machine could not get a signal! Luckerly I had cash on me to bay the bill.Would not rush bac
4
I always enjoy the food, service and ambience here. Serving staff are usually friendly and food is delicious!
4
Their service & food is good!! The waiters were very attentive as well. We have enjoyed ourselves!!!
4
Booked at Jamie's for a surprise anniversary dinner for the missus (who is a big fan of Jamie's) and was not disappointed. Booked it way in advance via their website, and the process was hassle-free and very user friendly. We found it to be very well located in the heart of the busy Orchard Road - easily accessible either via cab or even via the MRT. We were welcomed with friendly smiles by the host, and were efficiently seated to our booked table. It was a busy night, but the service was still fast and attentive. We both ordered Pasta (Jamie's specialties) and were very satisfied. Pricing for the food menu was also not too bad and still affordable. The main thing - the missus was very happy with the whole experience
4
Was hesitant to book Jamie at first after the somewhat disappointing and not so value-for-money food I had at the Vivo branch previously. Still chose to dine here as client wanted this vicinity.Surprised to find that food was interesting and tasty and set dinner made it more worthwhile
1
At 10. Much better places close by. Needs better supervision. Trading on its name. We had a pizza and drinks
4
We ate at Jamie's Italian for dinner. The meal was up to the usual tasty standard we have come to expect from Jamie's Italian. What made the evening most enjoyable and set it apart from any other meal in any other restaurant, was the service of our waitress, Brenda. Brenda was attentive to everything from the moment we walked into the restaurant. She was friendly, had a smile on her face throughout, and couldn't do enough for us. We would definitely return just for her wonderful service
3
The Italian nachos had no cheese in them! Pizza was ok and service was fine. Nothing memorable though. I wouldn’t go back if I lived here
3
Well, if you sponsor a restaurant with your name your should make sure the quality of food and the culinary experience matches your popularity.... This restaurant is a very average restaurant, closer to a fast food chain than a classy place. Very disappointed
4
Fortunately we made a reservation during the day as it was very busy during the dinner sitting. We enjoyed a delicious steak meal at this restaurant. It was beautifully cooked and nicely presented. We also had a side salad with it, and shared a chocolate dessert. The staff were attentive and ensured that you were well looked after. There are a variety of meals on the menu. The food itself was delicious but very overpriced
1
Visited jamie's yesterday with my daughter. decided to give it another try after the last mediocre experience I had there whereby despite them having several of the pasta dishes on as starter portions when I asked for a carbonara i was told that this was not done in a starter portion so chef says cannot. Despite me explaining at the time it was for my 8 year old daughter waiter again says Chef says cannot like its impossible for a trained chef to make a dish with a smaller amount of the same ingredients. Ridiculous...Anyway, I tried again last night ordered a steak for my now 10 year old daughter plain with fries. and me a pizza (Menu is pretty uninspiring) waiter came back 5 minutes later and said Chef said cannot as all steaks are marinated except for the ones that they had put on a special which was $59 ++ so for a 10 year old girl i'm not sure. Anyway my daughter ordered the burger from the childrens menu which was as dry and tasteless then any piece of meat id tasted, you have to feel sorry for the poor cow as effectively it had been killed twice!!!!I ordered the pizza which was bang average at best tasteless bitter tomoato sauce and a flavourless taste throughout. I ordered a side of spicey Gennaro inspired fries, Gennaro if youre reading this tell jamie to take your name off these its embarrassing to be associated with soggy cold flavourless chips.Normally its three strikes and your out but with jamie's its 2 strikes and never again. I ate at Gino DACampo's restuarnt in November my god talk about chalk and cheese
4
Nice place, the food was good, very simple.. not as expected celebrity Chef restaurant.. over all was good
1
Came in for a quick meal going against my usual better judgement on taking tripadvisor reviews into consideration. Went for the squid and shrimp tagliatelle. The squid was heavily dead fat fried and not that notable for a $20 appetiser. The tagliatelle was poor; undercooked pasta and tiny shrimp. Go elsewhere! Jamie, this is in your name
3
We chose Jamie's for dinner in spite of the not so many good reviews I read. It was crowded when we reached but we did get a table easily. The staff was at their courteous best and the food was good in parts and it did let us down in some parts. We ordered for the 'world's best olives' that is served with an olive/tomato tapenade and crispy bread thats supposed to be crispy. We were served bread that was miles away from crispy. The burrata was very good and the tomato crostini was also quite okay. The penne arrabiatta was okay too, nothing great there but the tagliatalle Bolognese was very good. The raspberry rippled pavlova was also just okay....we've had better meringue. So there you have it......, the 'okays' outnumbering the 'goods'
3
After some shopping my child decided he wants right there pizza. In Forum there is also a "California pizza" restaurant that we visited but please avoid it as it not worth value and service for money. So we decided to go in same shopping center to Jamie's. And we got in (I had lots and lots of shopping bags) and they took a look at me and decided to give us a very tiny table(even if the whole place was more than 60% empty) so I had to squeeze in a very limited and uncomfortable place with my Son and lots of bags that I put on the floor. If you dress posh they will give you a nice table. If you dress "meh.." You ll have less chances. Especially if you are with a child. The food is good; definitely better than California pizza that is in the same shopping center. The portions are small; probably because they use better ingredients. For instance a normal7 yrs old will finish a whole adult pizza minus 2 slices. The service is quite good; they will explain to you all dishes very properly. The food comes in proper time. They do not have too many vegetarian options and no vegan It's a good place to eat there are a lots of tourists coming from the hotels around I could say they could be more hospitable as this this a very proper brand and not some random chain restaurant. And as a matter of fact Jamie comes across a very hospitable relaxed and joyful kind of person when we watch him on tv. The wine list more or less ok.
4
I went there with my hobby, and he asked for a cold water while I asked for a warm one. Later on, the waitresses kept refill our water with separate trips! Very thoughtful! Although the Parma Pizza is too salty for me, I will still go there again!
4
I booked a table for 2 for dinner and my friend was already seated and I was late but when i walked in, I was asked if I was needed to sit a child at my table, which surprised me and was ushered to an empty table even though my friend was already seated at another. Later when I was seated, I noticed the Festive menu wasn't on the table, and when I asked for that menu, I was given both the lunch and dinner menu, when lunch was already over.Other than that I was happy with the food - the meats were juicy and tender, I even had pasta and wine that was included as part of the Festive set menu which made it really enjoyable
2
Food is overpriced and sub-standard. Famous Prawn Linguine comes with pathetic frozen prawns. Burger is better version of Big Mac, while its fries is worse version of Mc-fries. Super Food salad is just like very "home cook" mixed by myself after shopping its ingredients from FairPrice. Lastly, their Panna Cotta is just like those serving on the plane. By the way, we finished our meal with the kitchen smell all over our clothes
3
I have always enjoyed the food at Jamie's at the Forum but it was not the same this time. The pork chop and lobster linguine (from the specials) were good but the kids' pizza was not. It was dry and the sauce was too acidic. The tiramisu misses the mark. As has been pointed out, this restaurant can set you back a bit for a casual restaurant
3
We had a early evening meal and loved the service and atmosphere. Had fairly high expectations and found the food fell sgort of what we expected from Jamie's. We are not fussy or snobbish but the food quality and presentation could have been better and sharper. Definately worth a visit but just keep an eye on the quality of the food
1
I first would like to say that the service was actually very good and everyone was cheerful and nice. They were also very careful in helping my father find dishes that did not contain garlic (he is allergic). Unfortunately, the food was quite the opposite of the service. The pizzas and pastas were honestly far from anything edible. As Italians living abroad we have learnt not to be picky with our food when we are in other countries. However, from a restaurant that sells itself as serving good Italian food (and owned by a famous chef), one would expect that it truly represents Italian cuisine abroad. The tomato spaghetti and the spaghetti alla Norma were both so over cooked that they would break into smaller pieces as you tried to pick them up with the fork. The sauce was acidic and made it impossible to finish the dish. Does he realise what would happen if he tried to sell a dish like that for 30$ in Italy? The two pizzas were extra dry and the tomato sauce was filled with so much garlic that you could only taste that. The Parma ham on the Parma Pizza had been cooked in the oven with the pizza, making it rather a Parma-cooked ham than a Parma one (when Parma ham is cooked, it becomes dry, salty and very chewy). Surely, a true Italian restaurant would know that you only place the Parma ham on top of the pizza once it has come out of the oven, to preserve its tenderness and delicious taste.It is a shame that Italian cuisine can be so badly represented by such a well-known chef. Jamie’s “Italian” exploits the fame of a world-admired cuisine that he clearly does not understand and miserably represents.

Friendly welcoming genuine service, happy faces , help with menu
Great food and wine , wine selection was perfect
Meal selection was simple and elegant
4
Excellent service at Jamie's Italian, the food was really good! Although for South African travellers it was quite an expensive meal!
3
Very good service crew over at the Forum outlet. Freshly made pasta, but portion was a little too small.
4
I’ve been to both branches a few times and the one at Forum is by far the better one to dine in. Excellent service and delicious food.
4
Great place to chill with friends. Tables were nicely spaced and you can have a private conversation without speaking too loudly.
4
Delicious and reasonably priced. The service is also usually good even when there’s a crowd. Would definitely come back.
5
The food especially the steak that was out from the usual menu was one I haven’t tasted before. Juicy and delectable. The birthday greeting was even a plus.
3
Dined with Husband and 3 teenage sons, one of whom is Coeliac and must have gluten free food, which we were having trouble finding. Coeliac son really enjoyed his gluten free pasta and the rest of us could all find meals that we wanted to order. A bit pricey, but I suppose you expect that with the Orchard Road location. The Christmas light display outside was a bonus! I told the waitress that we would have still water meaning tap water, but she brought us a bottle of still water and charged us $16 so that was disappointing
3
The service is ok. Got a table at the counter as it was full restaurant when I arrived. The pizza is large, 6 big slices in one order. I ordered the Funghi pizza with mushrooms $24.95++. The pizza dough is abit mochi like. The dough I felt lacking in some salt. The pizza could feel abit greasy to me. But it was ok having a salad on the side. The side order of rocket salad $8.95++ was actually very salty. I think it was topped with sea salt and cracker black pepper. Even though I mixed it, I could still crunch many bits of sea salt so the salad was very salty to me. On the whole, not exactly a cheap meal for one. But portions are large(for pizza). I had to take away 4 slices. The Taste is just ok. There’s plenty of pizza restaurants anyway. Tried Jamie Oliver’s in UK too. Also so-so but rather pricey. Nothing wow even in sg. First time trying their branch here. Would I be back? Maybe to try the set lunch. Curious.
4
Third visit here and i would say it surpassed my expectations. We held our simple christmas dinner meet up at the forum oulet. Staff member serving us was friendly and gave good suggestions. The atmopshere was great. Place was decorated to feel festive. Tuffle tagliatalle was delicious
4
Lunch was very good, but the meals were only warm. Could be warmer for a Lunch. Overall service and restaurant style are nice.
4
I have been there many time. Always the same good food, especially the starters. Service is warm and efficient
4
always enjoy to dine it at this restaurant. we like the pizza and also the steak. really love the dessert also..
4
Jamie's Italian is always great, and this time was no different - a quick lunch between appointments.
Service was quick and friendly. Would definitely recommend the Traffle Ravioli and the Bresaola Pizza. Delicious.
2
What a disappointment. Ordered the vegeburger. Cost almost $30.00!! The vege patty fell apart and half of it ended up on the floor. Had no taste. Was probably worth about $5.00. Can buy better at local fish/chips shops for $8. Staff don't seem to understand concept of 'dairy-free' i.e. no yoghurt !! Also, there is no point asking customer if they enjoyed their meal, if you don't know how to react/follow-up on adverse comments. Also, would be handy if they posted their opening hours up on the windows/door
3
Food standard has dropped. The flavours were less rich. A little disappointing considering the high price. We had great service tho!
4
I would consider the food here to be fusion Italian. We had some salad, soup, pizza and pasta, which were delicious. However, the taste was different from traditional Italian. The traditional ingredients were being replaced with healthier ones. As a result, the taste of the food was 'cleaner' and not oily.Overall, the ambient was very relaxing and the service was good too
3
Came here for something different but minimal menu and quite expensiveFood was ok but not overwhelmin
4
Lots of choice on the menu and friendly and helpful service. The food was pretty good, great tastes and reasonable sized portions. We ordered steaks but they should have told us there were no sides. We ordered sides when the steaks arrived and they brought them out very fast which was good. Deserts not so exciting and restricted choice
3
Food wasn't great, my burger was soggy and mushy which was disappointing. Staff were mostly ok but I expected bette
4
Service staff were attentive and they had wonderful memory skills when taking orders. Changes to the orders were taken with a smile and we were served in a pleasant manner.
4
Had the funghi misti and spiced fries. They were delicious. Price was also reasonable. Would come back again!
4
Staff here are professional and welcoming and the food is fantastic! Best to reserve a table in advance as it can get quite crowded even on weeknights!
5
Staff was friendly & attentive. They accommodated our food requirements and even saw us to the door when we left. Our family had a good time there. Find it a little pricy but food is delicious.
4
The good: This was my 3rd visit to Jamie's Italian (the first 2 had been at a different location) and in terms of the quality of the food, was the best experience. The food had lots of flavour and the portions were quite large; which is why it was a good idea to share the dishes. The crust on the pizza (Pimped Margherita) was wonderful, the salad (Classic super food salad) was amazing and the dessert (molten chocolate praline pudding) was just perfect. The bad: Though we got cozy corner booth, the noise level was a little high. We had been looking forward to trying the panna cotta, but they use gelatin derived from pork to make it which was very disappointing. We are thankful they informed us about it when placing the order. The drinks, especially the berry blast, were too sweet. We tried something from each section of the menu. The overall meal came to a little less than SGD 60 per person, w/o alcohol. You get better seats if you make a reservation.
3
I doubt that Jamie himself has been here and I wonder what he would have thought about the dinner being served. The menu is creative and fun but unfortunately the flavors and the umpf is missing. The service is top notch, the place has a great lively atmosphere.
2
Pretty pricey . Service good but food doesn't impress. Quite disappointing given the price of the meal. Believe I can find better value elsewher
3
Visited the place twice, ones for a business lunch and today for private lunch. Went because it was close to the hotel and with the stifling heat did not want to wonder far from the hotel. The decode is nicely done with an open kitchen and Jamie’s face all over which is fine. The service is a bit slow even when the place was not full as it was today around 12:00. The food is bland, I noticed that clients were adding salt to the food in four tables around me. The basic products are fresh which is a plus but the down fall is the lack of taste and the lack of basic spices. I had asked the hostess if Jamie ever came to visit the place and she checked and came back with the information, “ he was never ever here”. I guess for Jamie it is a money machine as most of the customers are tourists that will never be back. It is a shame as the place has potentials.
4
We had a Saturday lunch at Jamie's in Orchard as a family. There is a limited number of choices. The pizzas was ok- nothing spectacular. The salads were great. We loved the salad dressing. The children's lollipop chicken and the spaghetti was a hit with the children. They did not like the salad dressing and did not eat it as it tasted like plain yoghurt. Overall it was a nice family lunch but nothing exiting. It is a bit expensive for a whole family
2
We had to wait for 20 odd minutes in-spite of the reservation made. The food quality is deteriorating over the many months we have been going to this joint. Dont plan to return any time soon!!
4
Been there with a friend for a 3-course dinner. Liked the pasta very much. The burger was a bit dry. The cheesecake was amazing.
5
We were a big group of 7 adults and 5 young kids for dinner. Our kids love their kids menu and the food were very suitable for them! It didn't taste very salty nor heavily seasoned. Excellent place to go if you have kids! We love the service staff there especially this young lady called Brenda. She was very patient and attentive throughout the dinner. We have kids and thus it was rather chaotic but she was always with smile and ready to assist us whenever she came over. In singapore it is hard to find such lovely service staff. We were often met with frowns at other restaurants when we have so many kids with us. Keep up the good service! Also special mentions to Honey, another lady who came by to check on us and even crack jokes with us to make our night an enjoyable one! We didn't get the name of another guy who helped us with the seating arrangement as we had to move the chairs more than once, he was with smiles and very patient! We will definitely be back again as we love the service there
1
Seated at a table and waited, and waited ... eventually went and hunted down the Manager to ask if it was self service. Then when we did get service it was simply bad at every turn... and finally my risotto was undercooked. Won’t ever be back
4
There is nothing special about the food however the services was fantastic! I’m surprised by the effort they put in to impress the birthday girl especially the board that the cake was served on was very well designed. It was totally a awesome experience! Well done and keep up the good work.
3
A large group of us had dinner at this place. The place is popular and busy but somehow it felt like it lost the special touch you would expect in a Jamie Oliver restaurant. The salmon was good and the ceazer salad was avarage. Service was ok but not great.
5
The service staffs were very nice although we were a bit late due to traffic jam, they quickly guide us to the seats, and with the help of the server to guide us what's the best to order, we quickly had the meals with healthy fresh drinks they have. The decoration and environment in the restaurant is very nice, felt like home with kitchen stuffs, books and warm color lights. The staff also helps us to take picture, they are easy to approach. :) Like it, will definitely recommend this restaurant! Jamie's Italian :
4
Went to Jamie’s Italian to celebrate birthday. Food was pleasant & the service staff were very attentive & even placed our cake on a wood slab with the words “Happy Birthday” written on it! Plus, they also gave us another slice of brownie (on top of the cake we brought!)
4
I had the 3 course set dinner. Comes with appetizer main and dessert at $39.90 fot dinner. Its actually a gd price for a proper meal. I enjoyed the nachos v much- totally diff from what i was expecting:) i will definitely go back to jamie's again!
2
Went to the restaurant on a Saturday evening and was surprised at the restaurant being half full. It no longer had the buzz before. We found out why - service was slow despite a half full restaurant. Pasta came over cooked. Have to keep asking for Water before we eventually got it. Why can’t they just leave a bottle of tap water on each table like they do in Australia or Europe?This place will close down soon if they don’t get their act together. That will be a pity as it’s one of the very few places in Singapore where I can get gluten free pasta.
1
Severely overpriced and undersized...no value whatsoever- never again. Why is the meat plank for 2 enough for one only- each of us got 1 slice of 4 types of meats and a bocconcini ball each. Coleslaw inedible. What a joke for $34 I can feed 6 with a platter of this style and better! And what's with the tomato tins used to serve it on... Maybe in a country town in Italy but not in a well-known chef's restaurant. I sure Italians would scoff and laugh at these meals- nothing Italian about it apart from the name on the sign. Harsh.....but completely honest. Overpriced beer and the crazy service charge & GST. Would never recommend to anyone. Our meal for 3 ended up costing $250 and ended up snacking at home afterwards as wasn't enough. I only hope Jamie knows how his restaurants are run....if he does....he should be ashamed to call himself an Italian chef
5
I’m Glad we had our dinner date here on a Monday. Food was surprisingly good and the price was very reasonable. The staff were friendly and accommodating. They also have kitchen stuff for sale. Will definitely come back!
4
It’s pricey but service is good and the food tasty. Though it can get quite crowded on weekends so best to reserve in advance!
5
I was somewhat skeptic especially reading the not so good reviews but Jamie's at the Forum was surprisingly good.I loved the salads, crunchy pizza with delicious porcini mushrooms.Free range chicken was also excellent.I will definitely visit this restaurant whenever I am in Singapore
3
Came here on Friday evening and it was really busy. I like the country theme deco, but they crammed too many tables in. So the space in between tables are really tight.We had the Seasonal Vegetables displayed in a plank supported by 2 can of Tomatoes. It tasted ok, but the $32 price tag is a bit pricey.Also ordered the fungi & Tomato Mozzarella pizza. Pizzas were thick on the edges but thin in the middle. Fungi pizza was really good as the mushrooms were sautéed before adding on pizza. Tomato Mozzarella was too salty. Pizzas size was big, 2 pizzas was good for 4 pax sharing for average appetites.The side dishes, funky chips was average, and really small serving. Crispy Mushroom Fritti was surprisingly good. We had 4 juices plus all the food mentioned above, and it came out to S$160, rather pricy.
4
Most disappointing thing was they had run out of the blackboard specials but we’re still advertising it. And it looked good so while I couldn’t have the seafood risotto, the pren linguine was excellent. Relaxed environment although tables very close together so you can hear everyone’s conversation
5
Overall, a nice experience.Stopped by on a Friday night, without a reservation, and told the wait would be 30 minutes for a seat, and even longer for the food since, according to the staff, the kitchen was backed up. So I came by the next night, notably earlier, and had a seat no problem. So that's my first tip: either make a reservation of come early.I ordered a simple margherita pizza, but was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful it was. It was the epitome of fresh flavors carrying the day.The price is admittedly a little pricey. However, by comparison, when I couldn't dine at Jamie's the first time, I walked 5 minutes down the street to a competitor, and ordered the same thing (a margherita pizza). That pizza was a few dollars cheaper, but it wasn't nearly as good as Jamie's. So in retrospect, I didn't mind paying a bit extra because the quality was worth it
5
Came here twice because of excellent food, service and value.Both times we had the 2 course set menu for lunch which is such a great deal for Singapore at $24.90 for either entrée and main or main and dessert. (Australians who are complaining this place is expensive obviously don't go to any restaurants in their home country!)The kids meals are delicious with a shaker salad which my daughter devoured and a drink for $12.Truffle pasta, margherita pizza, spaghetti, Italian steak, Gennaro chicken club sandwich, brownie and tiramisu are all amazing.Loved it all

From the outside I was expecting maybe a very flash restaurant. However it was more than that. Just awesome food at a reasonable price. A place for the whole family to dine. I had the special Crab Spaghetti, it was absolutely divine. Waiters were friendly and very helpful. Bring your family here for an inexpensive awesome relaxed feed. Happy Days

At here recently and as you would expect it was a good solid meal in a great venue with fantastic staff. Given the name associated with it the pasta was fresh, tasty and plentiful. Pork and Beef ragu was my choice and it was great. The garlic bread was light and tasty and my friends all commented how good their meal was. The price was to be expected for a Jamie's as you do pay more for the brand but having said that it was good, fresh and full of flavour.Very busy so make sure you get there early, expect to wait or book.

The calamari smelt so fishy it was inedible - scared we would get sickTasteless salad- no dressing - just a pile of greens thrown on a platepizzas with almost no topping - dry - but very expensivecarafe of wine with no taste and cost $59!!I know Singapore is expensive but this meal cost $220+ and it was the worst meal imaginable. We ate more cheaply at the Shangri-la Italian restaurant and as far as food quality goes, the Shangri-la left Jamie's for DEA
4
Service was friendly and efficient and the meal was healthy, all in all an enjoyable meal with colleagues after a long day of work.
5
Lovely here they can cater of gluten free and vegetarian,staff very helpful and friendly and the food is great
4
The food was very good and the restaurant was fully booked. But the waiter was running around in the restaurant. It would have been better if she just walked around, so we didn’t have the feeling that she was completely stressed.
5
amazing place,staff very helpful and friendly,they could cater for me as well,as a am gluten free and a veggy,myhusband loved his burger,and i had a superfood salad,i think best to book as it gets very busy in the evening,great i want to go there again

$200 Aus for 4 pizzas 2 small!!! Pots of chips and 4 soft drinks. Do yourself a favour and head to any food court and get a fantastic meal at a 1/4 of the price (with a beer

The table was too small for our plates. The main came 5 minutes after appetizers(we're not hungry cows!). The recommended special pasta of the day tasted horrid(especially the dry squid), I couldn't finished it. My mom loves her special of the day, cod fish(cleaned plate). Note to self, order cod fish next time. We all love our desserts; the pavlova, panna cotta and the tiramisu(even though it came in a weird small slice).
1
Called in without a reservation at 5.30pm on a Saturday. Place was empty with only two tables by the window taken. The host tried to jam us in between them, totally amateurish. I asked our server (who was lovely) if we could sit somewhere else and when she asked the host he was completely rude and just blanked the idea. We voted with our feet and went to Bread Street Kitchen and it was fantastic- great food and fabulous service.Sorry Jamie, you have some staff training issues to address before I will be back
3
I had a high expectation for this restaurant, having eaten at Tony Roma's, TGI Fridays and the likes, I was quite disappointed with the quality of the food they serve. the steak and pasta were so-so, the kid's menu was also not appealing except for the salad. but the waiters did a very good job, I might not remember the food I ate that night, but the service rendered to me and my family was something memorable, they really know how to make our time there enjoyabl
2
Food was just ok and the service was sadly bad for Singapore. I would have preferred to paid for an overpriced burger and my hotel than go back
5
Well stroll down Orchard Rd ,we walk in to be seated quickly it was busy lot birthday family's total mixed crowd you can have a 3 course for about ;$38 but can't remember I had crab and was it good I will even say amazing for me , main course Linguine and you couldn't put any more prawns in well you could I love them cooked to perfection so. Sum it up great menus good value for Singapore , sweet not my thing my son had some kind of chocolate fudge cake & ice cream had little taste it was good but sweets not my deal . Would I go back well no option the Boss said we're going to night so that says it all .
4
This is the place you hit when you need a simple food with a good taste. Nice Italian food without any hidden tastes. Simple & to the point!
4
I enjoy coming here for dinner. The food is reasonably priced, tastes great and great service. Would come back!
3
We were there for lunch and had a good meal but we saw a huge rat climbing through the walls beside our table. That issue needs to be addressed as soon as possible. The waitress serving us saw it as well and I I asked her to immediately inform the manager.
5
I love Jamie's Italian at the Forum. This is something of an annual affair for my husband and I to celebrate our anniversary because we know the people at Jamie's Italian Forum never fails to deliver the best food paired with the best service.
4
Jamie's Italian has several restaurants in Singapore. We went at Forum shopping center Orchard road area. This restaurant has cozy place. Servers are professional and warm welcome to customers. Some wines to be served for food matching. If you're looking for nice Italian's food, go to this place
5
If you are looking for a wholesome and nutritious meal I can recommend the superfood salad. It is large, delicious and healthy. The prosciutto, pear and rocket salad is not as healthy but delicious. My new favorite is the lemon, mint and lychee slushy!!The pasta and mains are also delicious. The ambience is cosy and comfortable and the staff are super friendly and helpful.
2
Brought my business partner there for a dinner. It was disappointing. The quality of the food was bad. Standard dropped too much!
4
good food, as always...great service also...the pasta and pizza are really good. Should try the desserts also
2
The quality of the food is a real disappointment. The pasta was under cooked and the sauces- Ive had better from a can. The prices are too expensive for what it is. There are many italian restaurants to choice from. Give this place a miss
4
We went there for my belated birthday dinner and they were able to squeeze us in without a booking. They asked we leave by 7pm (we arrived at 5:30pm), but they didn't force us out or anything (we left at 7:15pm). The service was great and they had some great specials. We had the scallops to share and I had the spare rib. It was delicious. I want to try some pasta and pizza if I return
4
We visited both branches and found this much more Italian lively. We found the service here more attentive and even noticed staff checking on orders before despatching out of kitchen.
3
Food quality so so, I had spaghetti vongole and the clams are so tiny I see shells only. My family enjoyed their food though.
5
This place is very friendly, the service is excellent and food very good. So convenient, located at 5 mn walking from my place, I like to join with friends or coming with my wife
3
Although food is not bad but considering the price . I can get better Italian food for the price and we are talking about full restaurants standards
4
We were really looking forward to eating at this restaurant and had it on our itinerary as a must-do. It did not disappoint. We ate here for dinner and had their garlic bread, moza sticks and pumpkin soup for starters. I had seafood marinara for my entree and my hubby had their steak and fries. Had molten lava cake and tiramisu for dessert. While we've had better (and perhaps, more authentic?) Italian food in another restaurant while we were in SG, it was nice to experience eating at a celebrity chef's restaurant and the taste and quality of the food were definitely more than above average
4
Dined at Jamies as part of our Holiday experience. Service was good, atmosphere was inviting, the kids menus were awesome and the food was good. Meals were a reasonable size and came out quickly. My only complaint was the pricing which seemed fairly steep in comparison to other Italian restaurants I had dined at in Singapore. Obviously the name and position come at a cost, which I was happy to pay for the experience.
5
Was amazed by the customer service as well as the food quality.Will definitely visit again.Prefers this outlet to the one at Vivocity
3
First time in a Jamies. Food and service was good but overall I was not very impressed. May be my expectations were too high. Its just another average Italian Restaurant
3
I stumbled upon the restaurant while taking a walk through Orchard Road. I ordered the Tomato Crostini as an appetiser. It was quite nice and flavourful and found the combination of tomatoes, basil and ricotta very appetising. I also ordered the Italian steak & fries which seemed to miss something. The steak did not do it for me and lacked in flavour. The service was very good and the waiter was very kind and listening to all my suggestions
4
We go to Jamie's Italian mainly for the excellent kids offering. The staff are friendly, they immediately help with baby chairs, crayons, and, importantly, lots of smiles and patience for your little ones. But what we like the most is that, unlike other restaurants, this place has great healthy choice of foods for the kids menu ( we are sick and tired of always being offered chicken nuggets and fries in other places). Here you get chicken lollipops, fish in a bag, pasta with home made sauce and home made meatballs, a garden in a box, an organic glass of milk etc. Also you can choose between a small kids menu and a bigger kids menu (how smart is that to prevent waste in food and money?). For adults, we love the pizza but also the fish and pasta dishes. Prices are ok-ish (e.g. biz adult pizza for 26-28 SGD) , a bit on the high side but the super friendly environment and the yummy kids food justify it. Just make sure you check the price before you order the special of the day, sometimes the specials of the day are double the price of the normal menu items
4
I find Jamies to be consistanty good food for a good price. Staff are always friendly and make you welcome. All up you should visit if you like good food.
4
The pasta and salad were both delicious. Admired the fast and good service as well. 😊 We ordered the lunch set and it was a good deal. We will definitely come back.
4
We enjoyed our Sunday lunch here and great that they include a salad with the kids meal. The kids spaghetti was a bit soggy, but the adult entrees were delicious. Will definitely come back to try some other items on the menu.
3
I had a quick dinner here and went with a crab and avocado app, pasta and prawn main course, and tiramisu dessert. The starter was good, well flavored on a crusty bread slice. The main course could have been better with larger prawns. Aside from that it was tasty. Dessert I didn't like. I did take it to go so maybe that effected the taste, but it was just too squishy and tasted a little off. I've had much better meals in SG, but I've had some worse too.
5
Very good pasta (and I mean the pasta itself). You can taste the difference. You can definitely see the Jamie Oliver influence on the dishes (crostini for example) and that's interesting for those who grew up watching his shows and have his books. Service was very good. It's a bit on the expensive side though. Finish the meal with a Limoncello (often complimentary in Italian restaurants in Europe) and you'll be hit by 11$ for a small shot. Ok it's Orchard Road/Singapore but still..
4
We have been here twice since arriving in Singapore, once for dinner and once for lunch. For lunch 2 courses for $25, for dinner 3 courses for $40. Given the prices I was expecting small serves but all were great sizes and we left full. Drinks also good wit 5 beers for $50. The food has been hearty Italian fare. Service generally good, staff happy to help with smiles on their faces. The restaurant is rustic looking but part of a shopping centre overlooking Orchard Rd-so given that the ambience is ok. Enjoyed very muc
1
I have now tried Jamie's Italian in Singapore for the last time... I kept on trying thinking they were now open for over a year and the kinks have been worked out. My Wife and I went early around 6 PM. Place was empty... we sat unattended for 10 minutes before we left. We walked across the street to PS Cafe. We were not disappointed... dont go to Jamie's ... GO TO PS CAFE FOR GREAT SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD
4
We have started to make this our "go to" Restaurant when we are in Singapore but are too busy to have a longer more leisurely lunch.Ambiance very good for lunchtime - staff are very friendly and willing to help you if you would like changes to standard meal sets - food great and quick to arrive - value meals which are good for business and casual meet uo
4
Excellent with young children. Had lots of high chairs. Pencils etc and a cool jamies kitchen 3d viewer to keep the 3 year old happy. Food was very nice and reasonably priced for an expensive city.Good service
5
Calamari was amazing, tasty and crunchy, was generous with the portion as well.We had pizza and the carbonara which made us really full by the end
3
Service was below average, as waitress are more focus on cleaning the table than attending to customers. We had the Ribeye Steak & Italian Steak, the sides (grilled portobello mushroom & balsamic onions) was good, well seasoned, but the steaks didn't wowed us, taste was blend in comparison to the sides. Good thing was the head chef came to ask for feedback after the meal
3
Third time at Jamie Olivers restaurant. Very average food for expensive prices. I would recommend it once but not twice.
4
made a last minute morning booking with chope and the restaurant came back with a confirmation and table request needs within 3 hrs plus. They managed to give me the specific table requested for , staff service was excellent and very attentive . Food overall was good and tasty.their daily special recommendation is not bad as wel
4
Quick, authentic Italian food. The staff really look after the children. Good location on Orchard road.
4
Jamie's Italian Forum is a good place for families to eat at for easy dining. A small but varied menu, with some veggie options
5
We recently visited during our vacation. Our daughter has Coeliac Disease and requires gluten free meals. The staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. The entire experience was so good that we returned on two further occasions and took our friends along too and once again received the same level of service and good food, despite the restaurant being full. On advising that we were celebrating two birthdays, the staff organised a special dessert platter and sang Happy Birthday. Really memorable evening in Singapore
5
I went this restaurant last week with my family for my mother's birthday celebration. The staff named Shze Lin present very good services and very friendly to us. We tasted the food she recommend, the food was very delicious. I'm felt thankful to Shze Lin and this restaurant to let us have a good birthday celebration
5
With friend go this restaurant to celebrate my birthday, nice food, nice place and good service for a waiters, her name is Shze Lin, she is friendly. We will come again
4
Had a truffle pizza and the Jamie Italian Burger. Both were good. Nice and quiet place to have an enjoyable dinner
4
Food was as expected for Jamie's Italian. Staff was attentive enough. The set dinner menu includes dome of their best sellers which is good value for money. They offer light and standard portion for small and average eaters which is good practical option for their customers. Great for family gatherings.
5
The staff were great overall, very pasisonate. Came on Fathers day, they had a special sharing menu. Food was delicious and plentiful for 4 ppl. Would recommend

Looking for kids friendly dining destination for a group of 18 pax is definitely not an easy task. If you do have this dilemma, you definitely must consider Jamie's Italian at Forum. In case you have been living under a rock or somewhere in the jungle of Borneo, Jamie Oliver might sound alien to you. In summary, he is a British Celebrity Chef, author of numerous cook books, plus TV shows, activist who loved Italian Food. Jamie's restaurants always focused on natural and healthy ingredients, with simple cooking method. Jamie's Italian at Forum is the second franchise in Singapore. While waiting for the everyone to arrive, LD and I ordered Salumi Crostini ($15). Salumi means different type of salami / Italian cured meat. Crispy bread with buffalo ricotta, crispy salumi and drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Crispy, creamy, sweet, with subtle acidity just make a perfect entrée. A good start to tease the palate. If you are an olive fan, you might want to try their World's Best Olive ($8.50). Consist of large green olives, with black olives and sun-dried tomatoes tapenade & crispy music bread. I am definitely not a fan of black olive, but I discover green olive is easy to like. Crunchy, refreshing with a touch of delicate sourness almost like a gherkin. Since we have a big group, we ordered plenty. Prosciutto & Pear Salad ($25.50). A simple combination of prosciutto and pear, with pecorino, rocket salad, balsamic and toasted pine nuts. It is definitely refreshing, I personally like the combo of salty prosciutto with natural sweetness of the pear. The pecorino, rocket and balsamic just enhanced the flavour in the dish further while the pine nuts give the dish its crunchy texture. Gennaro's Italian Sausage Pizza ($27.50). Bianco base (white pizza) with fennel sausage, balsamic onions, black olives and rosemary. Interesting white base pizza, with unique flavour arising from sweet balsamic onions and black olives. The dough is crisp and chewy, like a sour dough. However, I feel it lacked some creaminess from the cheese component. Ravioli Con Carne ($26.50). Beef ragu-stuffed pasta with sage brown butter, crispy pancetta, lemon & parmesan. It is a good dish, with al-dente pasta sheets filled with ragu beef. The sage brown butter gave the dish a rich flavour however, it is missing the OMPH factors. It can do with more sprinkle of salt. 280g Rib-eye Steak ($46) served with grilled portobello mushrooms, gremolata, funky chips and balsamic onions. We asked them to cook to medium rare, however we still find the steak slightly chewy, lacked richness and marbling of ribeye steak. Surprisingly, the grilled portobello was the best ingredients to the dish. Definitely, has lots of room for improvement. Lamb Rack ($88). Lamb rack coated with herby breadcrumb served with roasted mixed root vegetables and a yummy red wine sauce. Easily the best dish of the night. Cooked to medium rare, the meat just melts in your mouth. Absent of gamy flavour, the lamb is just to die for. It is not in the main menu, so you must keep a look out on the special board. A must order dish here. Service is friendly, accommodating and professional. The décor of the restaurant is modern, casual with a combination of open concept. The set-up and service are definitely geared towards child-friendly environment, where you and your family can dine freely. The semi open concepts will allow you to see the chefs preparing your food, maybe pique the interest of the young ones in cooking. Please note that due to Jamie's focus on healthy eating, you might find the kids meal a bit bland. Feel free to add more seasoning to your child likings (cheese, salt or pepper). Overall, An evening in Jamie is definitely an interesting experience. It was packed during the dinner service. The food is simple yet delicious, but don't expect a high-end Italian restaurant version. We'll definitely return for the lamb rack. Cheers!

we like to go to the Jamie's Italian at Forum...good service, we dont have to wait for the long for the food to come, even though the restaurant is full. Good service from the staff also. Good dessert
5
Wonderful food, lovely and fresh.Everything we ate was just so delicious!The cocktails and mocktail were refreshing, good number of choices
4
We always Jamie's food and ambience.Seating can be quite tight and noise level is high at the forum location.Felt cramped with our party of six. Wanted to leave as soon as the meal was over on this visit .i would request for a bigger table next time. Prawns in the linguini seems to be shrinking . But taste is all there. The fried calamari is a favourite of ours ! There's a lovely kale beetroot salad with quinoa that is hearty and simply delicious . We tried the pizza this time and was not disappointed . Jamie's risotto has also not disappointed us yet. Happy hour was also available for their wines . Servers were too busy ..Needed to remind them to fill our waters. Never checked on us during the mealGet 10% off buy pre ordering Chope vouchers. I think it's worthwhile . .
5
We have been to this place few times, every time we visit Singapore. Loved the new Shrimp pasta. Kids meals are plentiful. Our waitress, Joy was very attentive. On the list of the next visit
4
Absolutely very nice restoran and nice atmosphere The waiters are very nice and welcome, the taste also very italian taste and the location is near by the shopping mall in Orchard, Recommended for place to with with your someone specials, friends or even with Famil
4
Nice time as usual, very busy with family and noisy as well, but happy people it is always important. New lunch menu is good deal I think. The rest is overpriced as usual in SG.The waiters are a bit dreaming, you have to repeat around two to three times what you want;. otherwise nice location
1
Very disappointing experienceMy pasta was over cooked and the sauce tasted as if it had come out of a tin. Wife orders salmon and which was ok but only enough for two mouthfuls. She asked for certain ingredients to be left out but this was ignored. Orders the olives titled "the best olives in the world" but nothing could be further from the truthWe were both starving so decided forget the calories and order desert. Ordered the cheesecake but that tasted like a supermarket quality and a low end one at that. We also order a chocolate pudding which was cold but not bad tasting although rather small. The salted caramel ice cream that accompanied it was dreadful. Paid up quickly and ran. Jamie, how could you put your name to this shambles. Avoid like the plague!
5
We had our meal on Monday night. It was fully packed. Took advantage of the three course meal for 40.
4
Family loved the food as if was fresh. We tried the Margherita pizza, pork chop, mushroom risotto, truffle ravioli which was a new item in the menu. Parents could barely finish their mains! Would highly recommend the mushroom risotto, flavourful yet not overpowering
5
Nice friendly staff and thoughtful services. Always wanted to try Italian food and found this place. A great place for value for money pasta!
3
We were very excited to try this restaurant as we are a fan of Jamie.Hiccups with not so energetic team came to greet us and misunderstood us as guests with reservation-we didnt.We were seated at the far end corner of the restaurant which was not a big issue except for the inattentive service.There was a girl who looked like a newbie, unsure of things but pleasant to the customer.The seemed to be seniors did not have much interaction though their not busy.We cant even get their attention.My girlfriend enjoyed the wild mushroom risotto and i must say its cooked to perfection.The most disappointing part was the special prawn linguine pasta.The prawn was not deveined, which is acceptable, but its chewy as gum.When I asked the trainee, if their prawns were fresh she said she will check it with the chef. After a minute or two, came back and said they only use fresh items.I am Skeptical. Hope JAmie can take a look at thi
4
From the moment you enter it smells like homemade food. We've ordered a bunch of appetizers and a Parma ham pizza. It just tasted like home, like Europe. Absolutely lovely. Service was questionable and the tables are definitely way too close to each other. But it doesn't affect the overall experience. Recommend it
4
The food was so-so. Ambience super casual and the price was upper mid range. Taste-wise it did not commensurate with the Jamie Oliver reputation and good name. We have tried the Italian located in Oxford, UK before and that was better to this one in Forum, Singapore
2
Ate here on a Saturday night, so as a solo diner you are shoved at the bar/bench eating over looking the kitchen, on very uncomfortable stools - looking at a stack of plates.I have had a good meal here on a previous visit so thought I would go again, but was really disappointed.Garlic bread came in a bun style which I did not appreciate, and spaghetti was extremely sweet. $50 dinner was not worth the $ and I will not return.Service great, but they are just turning tables as quickly as possible at this restaurant to service the queue out the door.Plenty of much better places to eat in Singapore/Orchard Rd so give this one a mis
5
I enjoyed the pizza and pasta. It was delicious and the service was quick. Flavour was tasty and good portions for 2
2
I love Jamie Oliver, as a human being and as a chef. Unfortunately as with all businesses, no one does it like the boss! On my own so grabbed a beer, the tiniest crab and avocado bruschetta (which was terrific but tiny) and his "gourmet" hamburger. It was a hamburger somewhat above Macca's but only in the OK category. Finished off with one glass of Sav Blanc and bingo $95 bucks!! Now I know Singapore real estate is expensive but the fact that there were only 10-15 people in there at prime time on a Friday night whilst the street outside was pumping, probably tells the story. I would avoid
4
Love their ambience and the food portion is generous.Their service is not as good as what we expected thou. Most of the server never smile and looks like they are having a bad day.Thank goodness the food is delicious
2
I needed a quick dinner. Went in late about 8:30. Place was not busy but the service was terrible. The food was fine but had to ask for my dessert to go because it took so long for them to get it to me
1
Service was rushed. We had to ask for cutlery. Mains arrived on table before we had finished entree. Same cutlery for entree and main course. Water arrived after we had finished both courses and very expensive. 2 drinks and 2 courses for two almost $150. Couldn't wait to get out
2
I love to eat pizza but the pizza parma that was served was below any expectation from this place. Hardly any cheese on it, only some Parmesan cheese, no mozzarella!, comes with just a few very tiny thin slices of ham, topped with some rocket salad. A true disappointment as I really love eating proper Italian pizzas. Considering the price point as well - overpriced! The pasta that we have ordered was decent. Cannot recommend this place for pizzas. Saver was the good service. We will not be back
3
Although I recognize that SG is a country that loves its food savoury, the following dishes had a little too much salt in it, namely the Steak and Fries, as well as the Spicy Fries.However the Truffle Tagliatelle as well as the Salted Caramel Ice cream from the Chocolate Lava dessert was spot on
4
Our staples from here are the pizzas, pork chop and from the kids' menu, the baked pasta. We especially love the pizzas, any type of pizza! This place is crowded during the weekends so make a reservation! Booths are cramped and can be uncomfortable for taller people.
1
Very disappointed by my families last vistit at Jamie's. We have been go to this branch since it opened(having previously enjoyed ones in the UK) and this had to be the very worst service and meal we have ever had, anywhere in SG. We ordered the weekly special (roast lamb) and it was overcooked and cheewy, my children could not chew the gristle and had to spit pieces out. The portion was advertised as for sharing and was very small. The waiter also forgot the order so we waited 45 mins for the lamb. The overall service was very substandard and very stressful with our 2 young children. My family left hungry and very annoyed.They did refund us the lamb course but charged us for everything else. I don't think we will ever be going back. Shame

Located opposite Orchard Hotel, this Italian restaurant offers excellent Italian Cuisine including thin crust pizzas and Italian Pasta. I am having dinner tonight at this place. Being Sunday evening the place is quiet crowded. I managed to get a pkace at the high bar stool type seating meant for solo male eaters obviously. I started with a mocktail of lemon, orange juice, ginger ale and sugar syrup with crushed ice and fresh mint leaf. It was cool and refreshing. The starter was crab meat risotto ball deep fried served with mint and green beans sauce. Balls were crunchy and tasty. In the main course I went with New Zealand Lamb Chop grilled served with pickled vegetable and brown sauce. Lamb was very well cooked, juicy and succulent. Overall experience was good. But waiting time for food was little longer. But the waitress was very caring and apologetic for the long wait. You should try if you love Italian food and who on earth does not.   
1
I ate here a year ago and thought it was ok. Nothing noteworthy but nothing to complain about either. Visited it again last week (for convenience sake) and man was the food appalling. Ordered the Italian steak and fries: a dry, powdery and pretty tough slice of beef was served up. Spaghetti bolognese was average at best. I can bet that the western food court stall could compete with it. At s$40 bucks a dish, Jamie is really takin the piss out. Anyway, give this place a miss if you're in the neighborhood. Uma Uma Ramen next door is a fabulous option for a third of the price
5
Wow amazing food coupled with the friendly and attentive service I would come here every time I was in Singapore (infact the lady sitting next to us does). Highly recommend the Crab Arancini balls, packed full of flavour; and a pizza, second best pizza we have ever had, ever. The spaghetti bolognase was very tasty also. Note that they do two for one happy hour drinks till seven.
5
Went for lunch today and ordered the chicken pizza and it was absolutely delicious! Crust was crispy and seasoning was just on the spot! Funky chips are really tasty too with it's fresh herbs and fresh garlic seasoning (kids loved it!). Aside from the food, staff was very attentive, friendly and helpful. Kids were also given colouring activity to keep them busy. Although the Kids didn't like anything in the Kids menu but they sure liked the funky chips!Ambience is nice and quirky too
5
We were very touched by the effort the restaurant has taken to make it personalised and memorable for us. We would like to thank the staff- Dave for making our anniversary beautiful for us with the complimentary desert. We really enjoyed the food and the ambience. Thank you very much.
4
Food as always, fresh and excellent. However, inexperience waiter hampered our experience. He didn't recommend the roast of the day, eventhough we have made our selection of meat items from menu. What a shame. Hopefully Jamie's can improve on the training of waiters.
4
Place is always very busy. Nice location and vibe. Staff is nice and attentive. Food is good but do not choose this place for an 'Italian' experience.
5
The three course dinner specials not only give a true feel for Italian food, they are also a value for the dollar. The pizza and pasta were perfectly cooked. the appetizers were excellent, the desserts were very tasty.
4
We went on a week day for lunch with 2 kids (4 and 7) and everyone enjoyed ourselves. Friendly staff that were knowledgeable and able to recommend suitable dishes (including off-menu items).
4
Place was packed at 7 pm so that should be a good sign. Staff was quick, attentive and friendly and food was delicious. It's not a cheap place gor what they serve - I guess the name has its price, but the wines are ridiculously overpriced and yet still they run out of few wines in the middle of dinner service.
1
Been here several times, food is good, service passable. Unfortunately tonight was just not to be. Found a piece of metal in my ravioli. Slight cut in the mouth l. Imagine if it was a child having the ravioli. It would have caused some serious damage. Quality control just went out the window. Place was crowded, still not an excuse to be slip shod in the kitchen. Paying top dollars inJamie Oliver, I would seriously have expected top notch hygiene and kitchen management. Time for some deep review of kitchen staff.
3
Ambience is nice and comfortable. Service is good and staffs are cheerful. Just a small comment that the staffs are at time talking a little bit too loud among themselves. Food wise is a little lacking though. Felt that the club chicken sandwich was a little bit on the wet side. The taste of the meat is good though. Also found the Tiramisu is a little bit soggy and appeared to be left sitting there for a while. But overall, it is still a nice experience.
4
Nie environment and good services. The pasta that I'd ordered is undercooked but overall the taste is nice. Highly recommended!
5
I've to Jamie's a few times already and I enjoy it every time. The choice is good, the quality is good, the presentation and quantity is great. Waiters are prompt and polite, and deliver it quick. And I love the ambience there.
1
It is a bad reflection on Jamie Oliver, it's supposed to be an Italian restaurant but the staff have no clue about the concept of Italian. Served pasta dishes after mains, quality of the food also very average. A disappointing dinner for mothers da
4
Went here for a quick bite to eat, food was good and staff very friendly and helpful! The only feedback I have is the external toilets we're a bit of a pain and it would be better if the restaurant had their own toilets.
3
A family environment, tasty food and attentive staff. However the sitting is a little cramp for my liking.

The time till we finally got seated since we step in was 7 minutes as the restraunt was busy but the overall experience was great.

Scusa ma,this Jamie's restaurant is Italian only by the name,is not a question of price or food qualities,no Italian feeling at all,for instance I'm always order the most simple think,and I wait and see,but here nothing to see,no sign of Italian feeling .I get my margarita pizza,just a bit Better than la pizza come à la casa frozen from Dr .OetkerNo spicy olive oil ,no saucer with olive oil and balsamic ,no pizza bread,no bruschetta.Juste a big bill in the end.So Jamie if you put your name ( and I tell you I love Your kitchens shows) make sure they followed your advice
2
For a restaurant that takes the name of a renown chef and charges an absorbent price I expected more. There are a lot of places in Singapore with better service and better food. I recommend to give this place a miss
4
Food was mostly nice. Drink was a bit dissapointing. Service is Singapore standard.. okay for the first visit. But won't come back for the second tim
5
Great Italian food. Different than what you get in the US. My husband had the Prawn Linguini and it was wonderful I had a pasta Bolognese and loved it. They put a lot more sauce on the pasta than what many places in the US do. The US could take some lessons
3
Food taste, presentation and quality were good but kinda dampened with the service that evening. Honestly, I think the caucasians were kinda getting more attention than the locals

My wife and I are big fans of Jamie Oliver's style and simple but tasty recipes. We have all of his recipe books. We are both foodies and excellent cooks. We were looking forward to and booked a table at the Italian Forum for our sons first holy communion celebration last night, only to be sorely disappointed. The decor is nice and has promise of a relaxed 'home cooked' meal. The service was friendly, but only from the lead waitress. The others were blank and robotic. We ordered a 'meat plank', 2 x pizzas and a cabonara. The meat plank was nothing special. Nothing on it was home made. No in-house cured meat, jams etc. All from a packet. I ordered it for the promise of items like chilli jam mentioned on the menu, to receive only the smallest dollop of store brought sweet chilli sauce on some cheese. The pizzas were the biggest disappointment. Both were cold and certainly not freshly cooked. They tasted pre-made, with whatever the chosen topping thrown on last minute before they went out. My 9yo son is massive pizza fan and usually devours a full size pizza on his own. He ate only one slice and left the rest. We had to buy him McDs on the way home. To finish, we asked the restaurant for a special desert to celebrate our occasion. After several reminders, they continually forgot. This was 6pm in the evening, the restaurant was just opened. There was no excuse. We will certainly not go back
4
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Jamie's, the food was very good. I had the Salmon, which was excellent. The best part was the service, our server was attentive, knowledgable and efficient.
4
i like the food and the service at Jamie's .. fresh pasta and the pizza is great...the service is good also.
5
Great food. Good service. Will be back again some time. Having value dinner is a good addition! Go before 7pm for happy hour
3
Basically appetiser and main course is not tasty. Even the pizza very sub-standard. The staff are friendly.
4
Pretty good. Service was excellent. Fairly fast paced and noisy so if you are looking for a nice quiet place, this ain't it. I think that this restaurant reaches it's market with generous portions and good quality food but to be honest, it is not a great fit for me.. I don't want to take anything away from these guys with that said.. I think that it hits the mark for most.
3
First, this is by far the best restaurant we found for kids in SingaporeWaiters are super friendlyThe kids menu is very good, with LOTS of choices, some of them healthyThe kids loved itOverall service was OK, but quite slowThe menu is pretty extensiveI have 2 main complaints - prices are super steep, for relatively small quantities. For instance the salami sharing platter (for 2) has only 4 or 5 slices for each person - really small esp for close to 40 SGD ! - my burger was really disappointing - super dry So good for kids - otherwise stick with Italian chefs, not Brits..
3
Overall, I am happy with my service. I thought one area of improvement would be to serve tap water or iced water while customers are waiting for their orders, regardless if they have ordered any beverages. Always good to let the customer feel refreshed and recharged in the restaurant setting.
4
It was my first visit to the forum outlet - and it's worth a review. The food was good. There seemed to be emphasis on being different from traditional run of the mill Italian food that one ends up getting. There was a good balance of cheesy, fried and greens/ healthy options and there was choice for vegetarians which was pleasant experience One of us had some allergies and that was catered to as well The pricing remains high end for a casual diner - and that would limit visits - but apart from that an overall good experience
4
I came with a few work colleagues on a Thursday evening. One of the earlier reviews mentioned there are numerous vegetarian options which was quite important as one of my colleagues is vegetarian. A few of us ordered the set dinner at $39.90/ head which was really good value. For appetisers, we shared the crispy squid, bruschetta, Italian Nachos and a Funghi pizza. I thought that (contrary to many) the Italian nachos were not that special. The other items however - were outstanding especially the pizza - fantastic taste.For the mains, many of us went for the highly rated prawn linguine which did not disappoint. It was really flavourful. My vegetarian colleague had the super food salad which he thought was really good too. The only disappointment was the salmon. The person who ordered it was enjoying it until he found a rubber band in his mouth. That was the only disappointment that evening otherwise this rating would be 5 stars.The desserts (cheese cake, panna cotta and tiramisu) were all great. Service was warm and efficient. Aside for the rubber band blip, we all had a great evening
5
The menu is amazing, staff are always kind and helpful. The pasta is always a good choice. Great menu of drinks. The waiting area is nice and cosy - never had to wait more than 10-15mins for a table even on busy weekends. Definitely recommended for a fool proof dinner
3
Food: Pasta was decent, pizza was lukewarmService: Warm yet slowPrice: inflatedAmbience: distracting staff congregating and speaking to each othe
4
The panna cotta is my favourite dish and the pastas are great. The bruschetta is also very good. I prefer the Jamie's in Vivo City personally.
4
We had linguine, prosciutto pizza and marinated steak, which are all tasty. Our son had the mini burgers which could use more seasoning, but still okay. My favourite is the Italian nachos, which was quite unexpected, but was a great appetiser.
4
I have eaten at Jamie's many times and love the food there. It was first time for a friend (who's vegetarian). She was delighted to see so many options and enjoyed her meal.
5
We've been to Vivo before this first visit to Forum. Friendly and lively atmosphere, all the food dishes good especially the meat board.. the burger is enormous...
4
Visited for a quick bite as you can always be sure that the food is prepared the same way every time.
As usual, great food and atmosphere. Pricing is on the high side but that is to be expected.
3
Right smack in Orchard, convenient and great spot just when you need a pasta fix! Make sure you book ahead as this place packs up! Just wished the pasta was slightly bigger as a main!
5
Food was great. It came fast, and was delicious. Staffs were helpful and attentive. Good experience. Thank you!

Two standouts. The flavor intensity of the food and the gracious, engaging and attentive service. A busy weekday lunch service, a bustling mix of families, tourists and those of us that call this island home. The cultural "bubble and squeak" (sorry, food pun) of Singapore. Perhaps a touch noisy, with lots of families and boisterous kids, having a great time, but not overly intrusive. Service was unbeatable, especially with what looked to be a near full house. Knowledgeable, courteous, and unhurried.We choose the Pea/Mint Arancini and the Italian Nachos to kick off with and rather indulgently, a bottle of the Prosecco. Both dishes impeccably presented and just the right size for sharing. The Arancini burst with flavor, and the bubbles were a perfect, if not an exceptional, match. Just right for a lunch when there's nothing too pressing to do in the afternoon!We followed with two Penne dishes, the Arrabbiata and the Cabonara. Classic dishes, uncluttered, both oozing with flavor, and not drenched in the vapid sauces we all know to well, with soggy pasta. For the setting, surely this is cooking executed as it should be. So for us, if Jamie's Italian is meant to delver a relaxed, friendly and welcoming, atmosphere, with a menu that has some inventiveness, and with dishes that just hit the palette perfectly, coupled with delightful service.... then spot on JO. We followed with

A lovely restaurant in the heart of bustling orchard road. It's warm, Cosy and homely - a lovely change from the busy, sterile and impersonal shopping malls. The food is typically hearty, rustic, unpretentious and delicious. The spag- Bol really hit the spot for me. Portions are large so make sure your hungry. The chocolate brownie is yummy so save room for that. If your feeling healthy they have some really nice salads on the menu.
4
I was having a great time with my girl friend and her 3 years old girl who was occupied by colouring session while we wait for our meals to be served. This is a kids friendly restaurant. Beer selection was limited perhaps something that can be added and considered
5
We will definitely be returning! The food was delicious, the atmosphere wonderful and the service was excellent. It was a really enjoyable evening!
3
A first off visit, pretty average food choices, limited choice of wine no Pinot available on the night. Good service.
5
We had the day's special truffle pizza and the menu's german sausage pizza. Both pizzas are super yummy!
4
Nice ambience and the decor is what we like. Ordered the stewed pork and beef cooked in red wine pasta and the mushroom fritters. Both were delicious. We waited quite a while for the food, around 20 minutes. A staff updated us on the waiting time, which is a nice gesture. Well, the food was worth the wait as we enjoyed the food.
5
Since I had been stayed hilton, it was fully book dinner seat at hotel. By chance I dine in but it was the right choice. It was Friday night and so crowded however the staff who assisted us was excellent. We ordered salad, pizza and pasta.When I asked recommendation the way she answered was professional. As follow us she made sure all the meal was up to our standards or not double checked with us. I am also dealing with hospitality industry but I learned many things from her. I am looking forward dining in here again soon. Thank you!
2
I had the pasta. The portions are kind of small - I had the normal full portion not the small half portion. The worst part of it was the pasta was cold, some parts not cooked through and some overcooked. And it's not cheap right? It's like $27-$28 a plate. Waitress was not helpful either in explaining things. I walked away knowing I would never go back
5
My wife talked me into going; I had to walk past one of my favourite restaurants to get there. I'm glad she did. We selected the three course option and all the courses were excellent. The steak was my highlight though, cooked perfectly and topped off simply with herb butter, it melted in my mouth. The beer was a bit of a find too. It was refreshing to find a craft beer that isn't some ilk of IPA
4
We had our dinner at this celebrity restaurant. I found its deco and food are both quite good. The service staffs were very friendly & cheerful, in the same time was thoughtful & careful on handling our daughter's meal and bill. I would say we had great time there. Shrimp and meat ball pasta were both good & pork chop was surprisingly juicy. Handmade pasta was a big plus too.我們是晚餐在這家名店用餐，餐飲和裝潢都很不錯，服務人員非常親切及歡樂，而且在處理我女兒的餐點和帳單都很體貼及小心，蝦子義大利麵和肉丸子義大利麵都好吃，烤豬排意外的多汁，手工麵也是大加分，一切都讓我們很滿意
3
Jamie's Italian located at the Forum on Orchard Road is a good place for a quick supper before going to Shaw Cinema over the road. The menu is limited, the dishes vary in terms of size and taste, but the service is swift. Ideal for families with kids
3
Lacklustre compared to the one in vivocity. Nothing special. May be it's just designed for tourists given its location. Definitely not a night out place for a birthday party. Food ok but the meat antipasto was expensive for the amount. Should have gone to Cugini
3
I'm giving a 3 not because of the food but because my expectations were pretty high.
The food was pretty good.
The price is kind of average.
The wine was just normal and expensive...
it worth it to visit at least to see the environment.
5
It was a birthday celebration and the crew made it extra special! They were friendly, engaging, energetic and happy!
3
Some British American, what used to be Italian, mix of foods. Do not understand the hype. Mozzarella cheese was good, everything else average.
5
All you would expect from a Jamie's. Forget the price, this is Singapore. The food and service were excellent and a credit to the Jamie's brand. Well done to all the staff and thank you.
5
Good atmosphere...we like the food. The pasta and pizza are excellent. Should try the dessert, brownies and panna cota
3
Only went to this place to bring some out- of-town colleagues. Obviously because of the name and the TV shows, I wouldn't go otherwise. Read that JO has actually never gone there to train the chefs and monitor the quality and consistency. Food quality was variable. Was served by a non-local plump waitress- who seemed more engaging and funny with the westerners. That was expected based on other reviews mentioned. If it weren't for out of town guests, would go elsewhere
4
Had dinner with my husband two nights ago. Service staff Sylvia is excellent in her smile, attitude and service. Hard to find staff like her who is proud of what she does. Food is not bad, prawn linguine is rated 7 out of 10 by my husband. I rate my grilled steak as 6.8. The bruschetta are great, both the tomato and the avocado ones. I would rate them 8. It was a crowded Monday night. Acoustic is an issue because it is really really noisy. Can't help but compare this restaurant with Gordon Ramsey's restaurant at Marina Bay. For ambience, Gordon Ramsay beats Jamie hands down (may be Italian restaurant is supposed to be casual and noisy)? For food, I think It is another win for Gordon Ramsay as well. Price wise, both are not far from each other. I would pick to go Gordon Ramsey anytime!
5
Me and my two kids had a very enjoyable meal at Jamies.The service was good and attentive to our needs. The menu head something for everyone. I really enjoyed my raviolis in tomato sauce with lots of garlic.I thought it was fresh and good.The kids menu has 6 different options from baby beef burgers to fish of the day and my kids enjoyed their choice, also very fresh (you could just see that).They both even ate their healthy "shake me salad" that came with the kids menu.The price was right for this style of restaurant. It shouldn't get more expensive however.Will definitely return with the kids :-
3
We visited Jamie's Italian restaurant late one week night - it was busy (best to make a reservation). Our waitress was friendly and most helpful. The Crab Bruschetta was quite tasty. We ordered the small-sized pasta which was large enough for us and although it tasted OK, it just didn't have the wow factor. Overall it was a bit expensive for us (SGD$100) which included 2 drinks ($19 Singapore Sling cocktail and a $17 NZ wine) - however this is Singapore - one of the most expensive cities in the world
5
Went for lunch with my friend and her daughter. We chose to share four starters between two of us, they were so tasty and there was plenty for us. My friends daughter is vegan and had the superfood salad which was really filling and she couldn't finish. Overall gorgeous food pleasant staff, good service but slightly on the expensive side but for a special occasion definitely worth it.
3
Mushroom risotto is the best among the dishes that we ordered. The price a bit expensive but the service crews are extremely friendly.
5
Good atmosphere and service, birthday desert was very thoughtful. Service staff was knowledgeable on E-promos, so no hassle. Able to introduce the right kind of food, portions were just good, not overwhelming.
5
Second visit and a wholesome food experience. The freshness and quality of ingredients was as promised.
3
I thought the price for what we got was far too expensive. Good location but not worth the money. Would not go back.
1
My daughter and I were looking for a nice upscale meal and went to Jamie's Italian.Service was horrible- we ordered an appetizer, salad and main course.Food was poor.All came together 30 minutes after ordering, Luke warm food and the image below is the salad- with a brown avocado and mushy veggies.Normally I would have sent this. BAck but I saw 2 others at tables near me do such and it didn't yield them satisfaction.This was a 95 sd, we shared the three items so this is actually only 1 meal with 2 lemonades. For our meal, and we would have been better off at a mall take away meal.I do not recommend due to poor food quality for the high price
4
Good location, good ambience & decor, friendly & knowledgeable staff & good food!! We had crab meat & avocado bruschetta & funghi misti pizza. By far that's the best bruschetta ever!!! Crispy toast, loads & loads of crab meat, a taste of avocado & refreshing yoghurt. The thin crust pizza was freshly made & yummy. We also ordered lychee slushi - too sweet for my taste. Overall a very nice experience. Like other Jamie's establishments - it's a little bit pricey.
3
Atmosphere was good, music a bit loud but staff was young and it overall wasn't bad. Staff were nice, polite and attentive. Food was mixed. We had Italian nachos to start and they were spicy and good, not great. I had a mushroom risotto which was done perfectly..overall taste good. Hubby had bolognese which was ok. Prices were what you would expect, for food. Wine prices were heafty, this is were you lose your wallet.Overall, glad we tried it, won't go again
3
Lovely fresh pasta, interesting starters which were tasty. Unfortunately service a bit slow and quite expensive. I wouldn't go back
4
This is 3rd visit and this time really disappointed. Taste and texture all he gone down. Come on its Singapore. You have to pull up your socks.
3
Its totally different from the first time I went. Do not have the Michelin service and food, disappointed.
4
I have been there a few times. Food is good especially their starters. Staa is very friendly and efficient.
4
Always love foods from Jamie, the ingredients are fresh and the taste is beyond expectation. This of course comes with a price. So If you want a great Italian food and willing to pray more, dont hesitate to come
5
food was nice and served fast. I ordered a beef. They make sure the food taste good before serving out. Service was great! Highly recommend!!!
4
Food was good! The waitress who served us was excellent! My guest ordered the Amalfi lemon & basil tea, but he didn't like the taste. The waitress suggested he changed to another tea at no charge! She was cheerful throughout. When we asked for the bill, she reminded us that with HSBC card, we get 15% discount! Made our lunch a truly nice gathering with our friends
4
The restaurant setting is nice and menu is comprehensive. The pasta is nicely prepared and the pizza bakes in multi-layer of flavours. Although an Italian eatery, it also offers premium burgers and golden crunchy fries. However, I was not able to taste any fresh crab meat or avocado from a crab meat and avocado bruschetta. And the prices for the relatively simple home cooking are pretty steep
3
Me and my girlfriend dine during the afternoon of Tuesday. The resto design was outstanding. The lighting were fine. The salmon ceasar salad that we have was just average, the dressing were not distributed properly. Then the truffle pizza that we had. It was a lil upset, thought we will be stanned of how famous this pizza is but it was just an average.. the indian lady who served us.. she's was very helpful.. we'll still visit and see more of the choices and hopefully next time is all fantastico!
3
When visiting Jamie's Italian restaurant I had expected more. Upon arrival I asked for recommendations and was recommended the burger with chili fries. The fries was great but the burger was tasteless and bland. No seasoning at all. And served on a small wooden board which might look good but makes it impossible to eat without the burger in you lap. Service was slow and unwelcoming. Really not the food and atmosphere expected in a Jamie Oliver's place.Would not go bac
4
We were so fortunate , we just happened to walk by and saw Jamie's . Luckily for us they had 2 seats at the bar My sister & I enjoyed a selection of entrees Pea & mint arancine balls , carrot salad baked mushrooms and yummy polenta chips . A bonus was watching the chefs in the kitche
3
I was hoping that the Forum one would be better than the 1st one at ViVoCity , but the difference is marginal . Still very noisy from all the hard surfaces, and tables were placed so close to each other to maximise seating that one could hardly walk between tables ! The service team, when they had time to attend to you, was very warm + friendly . They were kind & helpful , but very slow through no fault of theirs -- place was understaffed ! Vic, our server, was excellent ... completely opposite of his grouchy, mean - faced colleague ( on plump side, wears glasses, sports a pony tail & constant frown on face ) . I think this girl is a local and her demeanour is so unsuited to the service line that her affable Filipino colleagues just put us to shame .Serving sizes were generous, and my main course pear salad was humongous ! We all felt dessert was their forte, as the tiramisu Martini ( with Baileys + Kahlua ) was loaded with booze & the Amalfi lemon meringue cheesecake was very good . Even though the rest of meal was just so - so , I'm so glad dessert was done so well that we could feel dinner ended on a good & positive note 
3
Food was sadly uninspiring, ordered an italian flat steak which apparently can only be served medium whereas their NY steak can be cooked as you want. The steak was strangely consistent in its texture so I wasnt sure if it was in some way reconstituted processed meat rather than a cut of meat. All tasted bland unfortunately as did my guests pasta. Felt quite fast foody unlike UK branches I have been to which are very buzzy and fun
5
This restaurant adds a more sophisticated twist to"traditional" comfort foods and throws in a few exotic offerings. Great "mocktails" as well as beer, wine and spirits available. Good atmosphere and friendly staff, handy location.
5
One of the best ravioli i ever tasted , the truffle is not over powering , so good... the waiter is attentive , i will definitely going back
4
Great and delectable pizza and wonderfully fresh pasta dish !
Tiramisu was a little let down but overall dining experience was memorable.
Clifford who waited at our table was helpful and made them feel comfortable
4
With Jamie's you will never get disappointed. That what's it's all about, I have been to many Jamie's in different countries and it's always good. You get what you pay for.
4
First time at Jamie's and was not disappointed. We had a great time. The amalfi lemon meringue cheesecake to die for. Must try!
3
Service was not good. Taste was super average, a bit disappointing, I must say. For what you are getting, it is indeed overpriced
1
Won't be back here for sure. Food was tasteless, even uncooked ones like parma ham and olives were of low quality
4
We went for a birthday lunch there and the place was nicely decorated. The food was fresh and tasted good, but it was a spin on regular Italian dishes. Not exactly what we were expecting. Also, the options for vegetarians was much lesser that what we expect out of a regular Italian place. They also have a shop where you can buy ingredients that are featured on Jamie Oliver's show. Overall, a good experience if you are a true fan of Jamie's
3
The restaurant shown us a clearly standard going from medium low to low average restaurant.The food is completely flavourless, tasteless and vapid especially for us professionals, we received the famous "ravioli mezzaluna" which was without any species, absolutely bland and without any cheese parmigiano [poorly provided by the waitress after few minutes and under requesting, which should be a duty before to server the pasta]. The kitchen is not managed by an Italian chef which is unacceptable, I guess a Chinese person has not the same feeling of the flavour about the pasta than a Italian. A sample Lemon Juice has been the nightmare of the waitress who served us a orange bottle juice sold and pretended to be fresh juice, even if we shown an evidence.The Tiramisu is served with soup spoons, completely uncomfortable to appreciate the desert, is the same how to turn a small cup of coffee with ladle, but even if we requested a small spoon this one never reached our table. The price is unacceptable for the food quality and service received , this restaurant could be located in some food court in Singapore together others by low price.The Restaurant makes business thanks to the location and environment, but it needs URGENTLY a chef able to cook Italian food with love and professionalism. We, will not try a second time, for sure for the same service we can find any where in Singapore.ladl
3
If you come with high hopes, you may need to adjust your expectations. I have been to Jamie's Italian in Hong Kong, Brisbane, Sydney and Singapore (both locations)... and my thoughts on them are: average food, a little on the pricey side, average service.I think, with the Jamie Oliver brand, most diners would have expected more. The Forum (SG) location may be "short staffed", as service was slow when we were there.The homemade pasta was decent, but nothing "special" per se. The menu is not very extensive. It is a good place for a quick meal - but do not expect too much
3
Food was great as you would expect from a good Italian restaurant. But service can definitely be improved.
5
Many great menu items to choose from. Garlic bread is to die for!
Friendly and helpful service and nice decor
5
Visited for dinner one evening, managed to get the last table as it was very busy.
Had the 3 course meal deal which was superb.
Large portions, great atmosphere & our server was lovely & very witty!!
Highly recommended.
5
Never disappointed going to Jamie's! good atmosphere, service is excellent, and the food is so good!
3
I expected to be amazed with the food but it was just good not amazing. Possibly my expectations were too high.
Great for restaurant for kids! Our waitress was outstanding!
4
It is the 4th time I have been at jamie's Italian. I have never been disappointed with the whole experience, both food and service.
5
I went to there for lunch with couple of my friends!! Place was packed with hungry food lovers!! We had reserved a table prior . Service crew was very attentive and professional. I really loved the burger I had . It was mouth watering!! Thumb up for team,food, atmosphere, etc.,!! Thank you for fast and attentive hospitality!! Cheers!!
4
Its my first visit here and i ordered a Spicy fries and a vongole pasta.One good thing about pasta menu is you get to choose Small portion or Regular portion. Not only the presentation of the pasta was good but it taste great too. As for the Spicy Fries, the taste could be better as the fries do not really taste spicy.Other than that everything else was good, will patronise again when i come by next time.
5
16 people for wife's 50th birthday party :We were a party of 16 with age range from the younger 9 yrs up to 81 yrs and a mix of Caucasian and local Singaporeans.We ordered a very wide variety of dishes:Antipasti for two x2Fish of the Day x2Steak x2Lamb Chops x3Kale Salad x3Pasta x3Linguine x2Risotto x2Pizza X11Crispy calamari x2Lemonade carafe x4Coffee and tea x8No alcohol was ordered.No desserts Please note nothing was offered to celebrate the birthday in the form of any kind of nicety e.g. Birthday balloons not do they or can they organize a birthday cake so we were asked to bring our own which we did, nothing complimentary was offered!The bill was Sing$ 800 after service charge.Pros:The food was if a very high standard and was was fresh, properly cooked and served altogether in a timely manner.Cons:it never ceases to amaze me when cafes like this with tiny tables serve the food on enormous wooden platters. As you can imagine the tables were rather small and there wasn't any space also you can't pass the massive wooden platters around without having to stand up and physically carry the platters around yourself which is pretty incredible and inconvenient.The waitress handled the table unassisted except when another girl stepped in to help her clear the huge platters which were heavy wood.Overall it was an enjoyable evening but it would have been nice if they had offered a little something like the tea and coffee or lemonade on the house as we were not just ordering cheap pizzas .....Not sure if I would return but it wasn't bad, you get what you pay for and nothing more
2
I walked in to the place a day ahead to make reservations for 15 pax, unfortunately the male host at that time just said, sorry we are full, but when I passed by that night that i was trying to make the reservations for, there were only a few seats that were occupied... I don't know if it was my color thats why I wasn't entertained or maybe because when i was trying to make a reservation, i wasn't wearing all my expensive stuff thats why i wasn't even entertained properly... just too bad...i can afford to pay too you know...
4
I've been to a few of Jamie's in different cities. This one keeps to the formula. Food was good, service good prices OK. Jamie O has done well with these restaurants and the standards are always good.
3
Food seems to be very different and excellent but service can be better.
They seem to have more inclination towards finishing and sending of the customer rather than attending to their needs.
4
We had a business lunch in this place located on Orchard road. We both ordered pizza which was well prepared and crusty. Good service.
4
We had the antipasti which were a treat, although portion could have been a little bigger. Sirloin was excellent, just made as ordered, medium rare. The cheesecake was making up for the size of appetizer, large portion
1
$14.50 crab bruschetta was a single piece of burned toast which seemed to be dressed with milk. No sign of any crab. I took one bite and left it. When the waiter came back I told him it was tasteless and flavourless but he didn't care. $25.50 penne carbonara which was basically pasta doused in single cream. I can only assume that the carbonara sauce came out of a jar. Finished up with a lemon cheesecake $14.00 which was actually some kind of meringue. I asked and was told that the cheesecake was underneath it. And so it was, a solid slab of...whatever it was. Possibly the worst Italian food I have ever eaten. Wish I had gone to McDonalds instead. Jamie Oliver hang your head in shame
3
Went here with my wife as it was next to the hotel which made it easy. I think the ambiance is good, has a nice feel about the place. This was Chinese New Year so you would expect the place to be humming. I ordered the Italian sausage pizza and my wife ordered the Risotto. The pizza was okay, nothing special and the risotto had to much garlic that it dominated the taste. The pricing is not cheap so it was an okay night. As normal in Singapore the alcohol was a crazy price
1
My friends and I booked for a dinner to celebrate Chinese New Year. The maitre' d was polite and escorted us to a big table for four. I was excited to dine here since some friends say the food is good. However, the server/waiter, Donnie (Jamie's Forum Singapore) was just arrogant and rude. He keeps on butting in when my friends and I were still discussing on what to order. And for the first time in my life I experienced being handed over a plate instead of putting it on the table! He also does not look in the eye when asking or taking our orders and even asked us to pass to him the Tabasco sauce while tidying up our table when it was only at arm's length! What's worst is, you need to pay for the 10% service charge. My friends and I won't ever be coming back here again
3
So much has been said about how food here's been disappointing - I am not going to dispute that. For somewhere bearing Jamie's namesake I definitely expected more
4
My friend and went to Jamie's for her last lunch while living in Singapore as she hadn't been there before. We were both impressed with our meals. The desserts, Molten Chocolate Cake, was lovely. The service was very good, although it wasn't busy so expected it would be. Would definitely go back again.

My server, Shelia, was fantastic!!! She selected at my request great entree's and the wine, yummmmmmmm. She is a sweet heart! On my next trip back to Singapore, I will go back to Jamie's, and request Shelia. She has a great smile, and is very knowledgeable about her wines, and dishes
5
Jamie's Italian is a consistent experience where-ever you go, and this restaurant is no exception. The food and service were both great.
4
Good Italian food with good food presentation. Enjoyed their classic planks although portions are rather small. Lamb chops were deliciously juicy.
4
Reading the reviews prior to this I am surprised and confused. Food was almost perfect. Service from young "Yi Tying" was friendly and sharp. He is good. My only concern was the cost £10.77 for a Tiger beer is hard to take. Almost £30 for pasta special and a beer is perhaps good value in Singapore.
3
We've been to the one in Sydney, Adelaide and now Singapore ... I think the Singapore restaurant is average as is the food too! We just tried it as we were staying next door! Will give it a miss next time
4
Good food but the service is average. They have a good number of staff but they're not very attentive. Some don't even look happy serving you

We have been wanting to try this restaurant in Forum the Shopping Mall since its opening last year but it was always crowded !! SO IT MUST BE GOOD , right??? We finally found ourselves at Jaimie's Italian for dinner last Sat and looking forward to a good evening. It started rather badly and went downhill all the way. The maitre' d was snobbish obviously practicing 2 standards , one for Asians and another for non Asians. But never mind,we thought, it happens all the time esp in cosmopolitan Singapore :). We ordered baked mushrooms for starters , prawn pasta , Margherita pizza and penne Carbonara. The mushrooms was too salty and the pizza was a real disappointment -have tasted much much much better Margherita pizza in other Italian restaurants in Singapore. The prawn pasta was just average and the penne pasta was a tad undercooked and too hard. Considering the branding and price, dinner was really a let down. This restaurant got 2 thumbdowns and 2 neutral from us
3
We've been to both the Orchard and Vivo outlets, and the experiences for both have been mixed. The pastas tend to be the stand-outs on most occasions, but they really need to work on their children's menu, especially since Jaime Oliver advocates so much healthy and wholesome eating for kids.The kids didn't enjoy their food at all and chose to 'pick' at our plates instead. Service has however been consistently good each time we went
5
Recently had dinner at Jamie's Italian on Orchard. Food was fantastic and service was great. We notified the waiter (Clifford) that two of our guests had nut allergies and he went out of his way to make sure that we knew everything we needed to know about the menu and the food we were eating. (Usual response we get from other restaurants is that it is too hard and they cant guarantee us that the food is nut free). Ravioli with ricotta and spinach were a favorite.Thanks Clifford. Great service!!!
5
We had a go at the outlet in Forum Galleria and chose the perfect time to enjoy our late lunch, where we had a choice of tables, or perhaps the hype has quietened down. The cuisine was Italian and the menu was a simple 2-page, appropriately descriptive one, so you knew what you are getting. I recommend the arancini (risotto rice balls) as a starter. It was light yet whets your appetite. For the mains, it was the all-time favourite Margherita pizza, the pumpkin and spinach rotolo (pasta sheets) and the penne arrabbiata, all very tasty and well cooked. In fact, because the portions are quite large, ordering 3 dishes each plus the starter to share was enough. Yet we could not resist ending the meal with gelato.The service was great, and privacy was given where necessary.
3
We have been to the Orchard outlet on quite a few occasions, the service have always been great but this time the food was just of average quality and taste. We ordered the prawn pasta and burger, the pasta serving was small and tasted very ordinary , burger was over cooked. We were not overly disappointed but the quality of and taste of food could have been better considering the price and the restaurant branding
4
We are a bit sceptical on restaurants from famous TV cooks, but Jamie's Italian is a good restaurant. Good food (even the french fries are very good, for an italian), friendly staff and beautiful enterior.
5
Enjoyed our lunch at this branch. Staff was very knowledgeable about gluten free food which is rare in Singapore.
4
Didn't go in with high expectations since I had heard some not-so-good reviews. But we were pleasantly surprised and very satisfied with our meal. The ultimate garlic toast was fluffy, garlicky and buttery. One od the very few bolognese where I could actually taste real beef and the pea and mint arancini was refreshing. Wasn't heavy at all despite it being basically a fried risotto ball. While the molten lava cake was yummy and full of chocolatey goodness, couldn't actually taste the saltedness of the accompanying salted caramel ice cream

I went there for dinner with my family in December....the whole experience was just terrible. I have no complains about the food, but when you are getting terrible service from the service crew; it really doesn't matter how the food taste like anymore. The lady staff who served us gave us an annoying look from start to end, hardly attending to our needs. A little boy from another table was feeling unwell and as his mother was rushing him out to the toilet, he vomited on the floor right besides our table. I feel sorry for the little boy and told his mum it's alright as she proceeded to bring his son to the washroom. In a situation like this, I will expect most restaurants will proceed to relocate the customers who are affected (if the restaurants is not full). We were early that evening so the restaurants was like only 20% occupied. The staff was all standing on one side of the restaurants chit-chatting away when all these were happening. We were left there to smell the vomit with our food unfinished. And when my wife called for the waitress, she gave us a look and thought that vomit belong to one of my kids. The she proceeded to say "I don't know where the cleaner is" and walked away.That was the last straw. We asked for the bill. That same waitress walked over and literally threw away bill on our table and walked away immediately. I have been to the same restaurant at VivoCity and my experience was nothing like this. Hence my advice is : Go to the VivoCity branch if you really want to try this restaurant
3
I had dinner and lunch to this restaurant. First time I took pasta and the second I had a burger. Food is good but prices are very high considering the overall quality...being Italian I know that is hard to find real tastes abroad but in Singapore I got better experiences in other "Italian" restaurants..
4
Went here for lunch one day and ordered the set festive menu which was quite a good deal, 3 course and a glass of champers for 55 SGD (I think from memory). For an entree I had a smoked salmon dish which was lovely, main was a pasta and dessert was a lemon tart. The main wasn't fantastic but still quite good. The lemon tart wasn't anything special. I am trying not to compare to other places but there are so many good, cheap places to eat in Singapore that makes this a tough review to do. It just wasn't anything special for the price we paid. In saying that the service was excellent
5
if you are tired of asian food and need a change try this restaurant the waiters are very friendly and the food is delicious they have lots of specials like 3 courses instead of just one. i watch his tv programe and was so interested to try his food well worth i
5
We went to this place twice for dinner over a period of 8 days and both times the quality of the food and the service was par-excellence! Our server Clifford was outstanding and really knows the menu well makes excellent recommendations. Also this place has one of the best Singapore Slings I have ever had! They also accommodated a last minute wedding anniversary cake request despite it being a very busy NYE dinner. All in all a 10/10 experience
3
This was my 3rd or 4th visit to Jamie's Italian restaurant in Singapore. I have been a long time fan of Jamie Oliver, enjoying his cooking TV shows and DVD's. And whilst the first few visits were interesting due to the hype of eating the famous Jamie Oliver's dishes, this most recent visit was really nothing to write home - or Trip Advisor - about.We ordered a few starters and pastas and pizzas. The pastas were just okay, and one of two pizzas was good (the Italian Sausage). The starters were actually quite good, with the carrot salad and the pea &a mint arancin. The chianti was pretty good, too.We were however disappointed that the cauliflower starter was no longer on offer, something we really enjoyed
4
Kids-friendly restaurants are fairly hard to come by especially on Orchard Road in Singapore. Jamie's Italian at Forum is probably one of the very few places that I place in that category. This was indeed a pleasant surprise to see children (mine, but not only!) could move around easily.In terms of food, this also was a relatively good surprise - it is certainly casual they do well what they do. Special mention to the waitress who really provided us with a lot of help.Pricewise, well, it is not cheap but on Orchard you know what to expect. It's not overpriced though as quantity won't disappoint you for sure. For anyone looking for a casual but elegant place to have lunch or dinner in the Orchard area, Jamie's Italian at Forum is a pretty good option
4
Jamie's at Forum has good service and fantastic food. The fun, yet busy atmosphere is great for an end of the week dinner with friends or solo as it can be a bit noisy.
5
Jamie's at Forum has consistently delivered superb service and fantastic food. This was the first year we decided not to go to a hotel and it was a great choice
4
A great place for a cost romantic dinner. Food was okay but desserts were good! Maybe could improvise on the menu!
2
I have been there twice til now and I now know that I am not going to return for any other meet ups with friends. Though the service and food were not so good, cocktail that we tried were actually good. So I give two stars. As per service, they asked us whether they can clean up the table every min while they see we were still having the meal. I felt like we have to hurry to finish up all the meals as soon as possible to get out of the restaurant. Also the allocated server for my table was busy with other table so I asked other server passed by our table about something and he just said "you need to ask your server. Next time please". ..........Am I your student...? Anyway, no so good experience
3
Everything: garlic bread, pizza, beef, even the rocket salad was salty and I had to ask for a change. The staff service was the only redeeming point of the evening. They were super attentive and nice. I'm not sure whether it was a Boxing Day syndrome but please taste the food before they are sent to the tables please.
4
All of us enjoyed every dish we ordered. The stand out was the starter of fried squid with garlic and chilli. We had to order another! Service was very attentive and quick. This is a stark contrast to Jamie's Italian at Vivo where we no long go after four bad experiences. Can't wait to go back to the Forum
4
The Food was fantastic, it's a famous chef's restaurant, so of course your will pay for this perk, however the service is a little off - at least on this particular night. The restaurant itself feels frantic, almost a little out of control - and there wasn't even a wait when we arrived on a Saturday evening. It was full, but not overflowing. Pay more attention to the customer and this place will be outstanding.
2
Great anticipation for the opening of Jamie's on Orchard Rd - but very disappointed. Pasta was overcooked, sauces nondescript, service lackadaisical. Prices high, but coasting on the Jamie Oliver name and reputation.Give this franchise a miss
5
Able to handle specific dietary requirements with utmost care and detail. Staff were friendly and wonderful and the food was great. Hard to find a restaurant in Singapore which can accommodate to severe allergies. Will be going back very soon.
5
We would like to thank our wonderful server Clifford. He explained everything clearly, made sure we were comfortable and was always attentive without being intrusive. The evening went on very well and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The pizza was hand made on the spot with a great crust. Prawns were very fresh and perfectly cooked. This outlet is the best in Singapore so far. A very underrated Italian choice. Our favorite weekday evening hangout @ orchard.

Had a really pleasant experience with my family there, the food was good and the staff were really good and served extremely well

Jamie’s Italian Restaurant at the Forum was bustling with customers for lunch on Sunday. One of the better known celebrity chefs around, made popular by his TV series on cooking hearty meals and comfort food, Jamie’s Italian is inspired by Jamie’s passion for the Italian way of life. There’s another branch of Jamie’s Italian at VivoCity. The exterior of the restaurant may look quite plain, but once inside, the atmosphere is one of purposeful activity, waiters and waitress moving quickly. Lots of families with young children and almost all the tables occupied. The ambiance is that of a huge kitchen, with service counters along one side, a fairly large number of tables scattered in a fairly large area. Lots of bottles, books, cooking paraphernalia as decor. The noise level is quite high but bearable. The service has been reported in earlier reviews at other sites as very poor, but on the contrary, we found the waiters polite, attentive and efficient. Without prompting, one brought over an empty tray for the empty mussel shells from the Sea Bass dish my daughter ordered. The manageress popped around several times to enquire if all was well.We ordered from the Christmas Lunch 3 course set menu which included a welcome bubbly drink of Prosecco, a starter, main and dessert. All for $49.90++. The Christmas Dinner 3 course set cost $65.90++ Among the starters we had the following: Smoked salmon salad with salt-roasted beetroot, buffalo ricotta, crackers and fresh horse radish. A Celeriac Truffle Soup with black truffle oil, home made rosemary focaccia; the Festive Italian Pate which came with toasted ciabatta, chicken liver and vin santo pate and parmesan. I had the celeriac soup which was served with truffle oil and the focaccia. This was tasty, well seasoned and aromatic. The portion was just right. I tasted the sea bass, but found the aroma from the mussels a little too strong.For the Mains we ordered Sea Bass with white wine,chili with fennel, garlic broth and steamed mussels and saffron aioli. The Chicken al Mattone was a chicken breast served with crispy prosciutto, balsamic onions and pan juices. The Italian Flash Steak was a flash-grilled sirloin steak with herb garlic butter, rocket salad and thin fries. All these were accompanied with a side dish of roasted rosemary potatoes and roasted root vegetables. One person ordered the Prawn linguini pasta, a tomato base sauce with cherry tomatoes, fried garlicky prawns in fennel, tomatoes, chilli, saffron in fish broth with lemony rocket. I had the chicken which was tender, moist but found the prosciutto a little too saltish. Otherwise the flavours were well balanced with the crunchiness and freshness of the pomegranate seeds and acidity of the caramelised onions.For the deserts, we sampled the Tangy Lemon Tart which was topped with lemon curd and whipped vanilla cream, pomegranate and fresh mint. The Tiramisu Pavlova was a meringue with dark chocolate ice cream, mashed hazelnuts and hot chocolate sauce. Two of us ordered ice cream which was 3 scoops per portion. Flavours of the day were: dark chocolate, honeycomb and raspberry. All were rich in flavour and creamy smooth in texture.The food we had was generally very good. Prices are average for Italian food in a good establishment. The set menus for lunch and dinner are good value for the buck. We had glasses of iced water which were filled from a canister and when this was empty, it was replaced with a full canister without our prompting. There’s free WiFi and the restaurant is wheel chair friendly. Lot’s of baby-high chairs for the younger customers needing them - evident of patronage by families with kids. I recommend calling in to book a table for a week end lunch or dinner as the place was pretty crowded.

I had high hopes going to Jamie's Italian, which I just happened to spot on Orchard Road. My previous experiences from the restaurants in the UK have been so good. It was quite late, so I only ordered a Caesar's Salad. Unfortunately this was a disappointment - some of the lettuce leaves were bitter, and there was no Romana, just regular lettuce. The parmesan was ground, not flakes, which was OK, but there was not enough of it to give taste. The chicken was good, and the dressing tasted right. I also took a side of chili fries, which were excellent, and the house ketchup was also good, more like tomato paste than ketchup, but very tasty. Service was good, but not very fast
1
food was ok.. hated the service!! Me and my friends were looking for a place to eat earlier and we decided to eat at jamie's. I had such high expectations given the positive reviews we have read and heard all around. However i was not expecting to be disappointed as the service was really bad. We were a group of 6 adults and 2 kids, one under 2 yrs old. So of course it was expected that we will request for a baby chair - unexpectedly the girl who was serving us said no it was not possible. She cited that we were seated at a very narrow space. We insisted and then after excusing herself, a filipino crew suddenly appeared without so much as a hi and hello nor an introduction. He immediately told us 'NO' we cannot accomodate your request. He did not even give us an option but just said no we dont give baby chairs when seated at this part.. so my mom who was avoiding a confrontation just said ok its fine. After hearing that, the filipino crew suddenly left.. then that wasNot the end of it- when we left, no one was courteous enough to say thank you, nor no one was kind enough to as how we are. And no one even opened the door to my wife who was holding my child. And the best part?? A crew was at the door just looking at my wife.. def we will not come back nor will recommend the place.
1
Let down and felt ripped off by the restaurant. The linguine isn't cooked properly and the portion is only a mouthful. Finish the dinner in 5 minutes. Service is not great either. Total damage about $70. Won't go again for sure. Won't even bother to put up a picture as there is nothing to show. Seldom write negative reviews but this is one of them
4
Perhaps you wouldn't immediately think to visit an Italian restaurant for a burger. When we went, we weren't in the mood for pizza or pasta, and a burger with pancetta sounded pretty fantastic. In short, it was! Highly recommend the burger and the pumpkin bruschetta, and save room for dessert because the lemon meringue cheesecake was delicious. Atmosphere was lively, and service was good. I'll definitely return
5
Right from the food , to the ambiance, the staff and the green badge, it's been a great lunch. The shangria was well balanced and fresh and so was the chicken lollypop. You could feel freshness of the ingredients and the warmth which the food has been cooked. Must try.
4
The first my family and came, we were disappointed with the food. Moreover with the service staffs. Last Friday, we felt the warm welcome and had fun. Good tasted way better.Even told my husband to give it another try. He refused to come back after his first visit. But upon persuasion, he now will give it a try
5
Located at the Forum at Orchard Road Claymore Crossing, this Italian Pizza house you can not miss. I am frequent at this place being regularly staying at Orchard Hotel, which is bang opposite. You start with potato soup and their thin crust pizza is a winner all the way. You can also order sides of your choice and they have good choice of desserts if you have a sweet tooth. Pocket pinch is also within.reasonsble range. I recommend if you are visiting Orchard area and if you are Pizza lover
5
We were worried it would be over posh and pricy. Not so. Good grub, well served, sensibly priced.Bustling environment, no frills, and we loved it.Waiters friendly and accomodating.S had chicken with mushroom sauce - excellent. I had the super salad with chicken - delicious
4
Forget that it's Jamie Oliver. For me, aside from the name, the place doesn't remind me of the famous English chef. That however isn't important. So I'm not hung up abt it.
The food though is pretty good. Good enough to satisfy your Italian craving.
4
Good Italian food. A great venue for casual dining, group gathering. Must have antipasti, roasted squash, it's yummy! :
3
Lunch with 3 pizza-loving children was something of a disaster - they took one bite of their pizza and declared that the cheese was "yuck". One ate the pizza once we had removed he topping, but the other two refused - so a rather disappointing and expensive non eventThe ice cream retrieved the situation slightly and the service was good, but come on Jamie's - a pizza which children won't ea

Have been to the one in Perth Australia twice (first time years ago was awesome, second time 12months ago pretty poor). Decided to try this one with the girlfriend and mum. Unfortunately was the same as the one in Perth. Pros: lovely staff, great environment, location and decor Cons: food was average, pricey for what it is, lacked flavorThere are now many of these across the world (have even seen one in seedy Kuta, Bali of all places) with suspiciously identical menus. Unfortunately it seems the Jamie's Italian franchise has become subject to a chain restaurant, seems the chef actually cooking has little to no influence over the menu.Wouldn't recommend for the money.
1
Jamie Oliver is known for his simple recipes and great food!This was nothing resembling Jamie Oliver's cooking!Apart from the name which they purchased this has nothing to do with Jamie Oliver.Food too complicated and expensive!Service excellent but food was really not good!Will never go again! Awful! Shame on you Jamie! There was even a publicity for additional franchise options....This is all about money
2
We were there for dinner (made reservation) and was sorely disappointed. We ordered ravioli, chicken roulade (can't remember what they called it in the menu) and prawn pasta. Ravioli tasted like they were frozen ones, skin was thick , filling had no taste,sauce was bland too. Because this is an Italian restaurant I had expected an authentic ravioli, but even frozen ravioli from the supermarket cooked with a bottled cream sauce tasted better. Roulade was too dry. Prawn pasta was at least not too bad, tomato base was alright, pasta al dente but the dish used small prawns instead. There are plenty of decent authentic Italian restaurants in Singapore that has the same pricing point as Jamie's Italian but the quality and taste is better by a mile.
5
I've always been a little hesitant at eating at a "celebrity chef ' restaurant in the past but I have to say that I would eat her again whenever possible.Firstly, if you want to eat here, book a table (which you can also do online). We were glad we had booked as the restaurant was extremely busy. Service was quick, professional and friendly. There's a great atmosphere in this restaurant.... It's noisy, seemingly a little chaotic at times and customers genuinely seemed to be enjoying themselves. Very few people had their heads buried in their mobile phones! As well as the menu, there are daily specials to consider. The menu offers a good choice of dishes with something for everyone. There is a varied selection of wines bearing in mind that wine prices in restaurants are always on the high side. The pizzas are generously sized and mine was delicious and the prawn linguine was very tasty. We thoroughly enjoyed our experience so much so a couple of days later we booked again. Our second experience was just as good as the first. Once again a great atmosphere and excellent service. This might sound a little crazy given the nature of this restaurant but there was something typically Italian about it! Two main courses with a glass of wine and water cost around SGD90 which we thought was very reasonable.Would we eat here again next time we are in Singapore.....definitely
2
The food we ordered was at best mediocre. Nothing common with the immage they try to promote. I've had mucm much better pastas and chicken elsewhere in more humble restaurants. The service though was excellent.
4
We really wanted to eat in a more local venue but after spending over an hour looking for somewhere to get a gluten free meal we spotted Jamie Olivers and knew they did gluten free pasta so we went in. You could have been in a Jamie's anywhere so it wasn't really what we'd hoped for but our food was fine. We had to wait a while for a table and the service was a bit slow but you can rely on a quality meal
1
My family and I have eaten a couple of times at Jamie's Italian and quite enjoyed the food, venue and service. More recently we have tried the delivery service (through Deliveroo) twice and each time found ourselves eating completely cold pasta and pizza. Upon inquiry with the delivery company, we were assured that the food was collected on schedule and therefore, the issue is that the restaurant's kitchen is not coordinated, meaning the meal sits on the counter for a long time before collection. The problem seems to be recurrent and from a customer's perspective, it is unacceptable to pay restaurant prices for a cold meal
4
Parma ham pizza is always my favourite. Pasta is very special, taste very nice. Service also not bad.
4
The service is good, friendly staff, but the food is a little bit too dry, below standard. The Fried food is better in my opinion.
The weekday $39.9 dinner menu is worth.
3
We visited on a Saturday night. My expectations were not high as my experiences with the Jamie's restaurants in London were disappointing. Overall the food wasn't bad and the portion sizes were generous (the steamed fish in particular was very large) and service was ok. Good for a casual meal for families with kids but not for work lunches or dinners.
4
2 couples and a kid, and i must say we had an excellent afternoon. The atmosphere was fantastic, and "kid kit" meant that the young ones were kept occupied.We ordered 2 pastas and 2 pizzas and I must say the food was amazing!Will defo come back again!
3
The food was decent enough with some innovative twists but other dishes were poorly executed like the grilled vegetable plank. The pizza came out burned and dry but was replaced without a fuss. The service was painfully slow and some of the waiters did not seem knowledgeable about the menu. We had to wait for 20 minutes to get somebody's attention and get the bill. I'd give this one a Miss as there are many other great Italian food options in Singapore. On the plus side it was very kid friendly especially at earlier dinner timing
4
The Jamie's menu offers a great selection of quality meals at affordable prices. Child friendly as well, this place was packed on the Saturday evening I came for dinner. Loved the pasta and would recommend the tiramisu - it has a real twist and was very enjoyable, although my waistline probably groaned again!
2
At our 2nd attempt to get into this restaurant we were finally successful given that this time we had the foresight to make reservations. Our family sat down and looked at the menu which wasn't as extensive as I had hoped but still had something for everyone. Looking at the prices I figured the portion sizes would tend towards the generous so I slightly under-ordered. We started with a bread basket and breaded mushrooms, and just like that my wallet was almost $30 lighter. The bread basket was ok but the mushrooms while tasty came in a shockingly thin layer in a flat casserole dish. I then ordered the salmon as did my father, my wife got the super food salad and kids' burgers for my son. My salmon portion was laughably stingy and not very memorable. My wife loved her salad while my son was indifferent to his burger offering it to me to finish (usually not a good sign when he's hungry!). We finished off with dessert and coffee. I had the Epic Brownie which was the only unequivocally good thing we had ordered there. My wife enjoyed her latte and my son his big scoop of gelato. To summarize, the appetizers were decent (but small), I didn't care for my main course, but dessert was great. The bill for us four came to a swoon-worthy $190 and besides one coffee no one had even ordered other drinks! That's a lot to pay for a meal that I would consider more casual than fine dining. I suppose it was worth it once to see what all the fuss was about, but yet again the hype far exceeded reality. I certainly wouldn't go there again, there are far better destinations for good family meals than this one
2
Just had lunch with the family at Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Singapore. Spent 20 SGD on a Caesar salad, I would expect a much larger portion. Left hungry and disappointed
2
We had lunch there on a Saturday, service is OK without products knowledge The risotto was acidic, Prawn pasta (supposed to be a best ..) no interest at all.....tasteless and a Pork chop below any expectations...2 glass of average wine and a ice tea for over 200$...
3
After dining we had cooking smell on us, like eating in a kitchen. The super salad, grilled chicken were very good but the crab, avocado bruschetta was really bad. The crab meat was off and the bread was all soggy. Service was not there. Disappointed
4
Was not sure about coming after other reviews-- what i found was very good-- good food, nice ambiance and excellent service
2
We are kind of disappointed as the venue wasn't quite suitable for business meeting. Recommended for family dining though.
4
The service here is great, friendly and attentive staff. Only gripe I have is that I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was hot... and so was the 'iced' water.
Food was amazing!!
5
We went there for lunch together with my mother-in-law, sister-in-law, wife and 6-month old kid. The ambiance is great and there is a rustic feel to the place and the staff is accommodating. Special mention to the high chair, my kid loved it.We got the Jamie's Super Lunch S$ 27.90 for three course and S$ 21.90 for a two course meal. We paid a little over $S 130 total as we took two sets for the three-course and two sets of the two-course meal. Everything is yummy, from the steak to the pasta to the pizza. Definitely going to be back :
4
We visited this restaurant because of our experience at Jamie's Italian at Vivo Mall a couple of days earlier. The ambience here wasn't as good as the other restaurant due to the fact it was a bit quieter, but all other aspects of our visit were consistent with our previous Jamie's Italian experience. The food, service, decor, all superb. We had the same entree as previous because it was so good, the Italian nachos. We both had pasta dishes that were very tasty and filling. We will definitely keep an eye out for these restaurants as we travel in the hope we can get such an experience each tim
3
Dined here during a brief stop over in Singapore. As I exited my hotel I saw Jamie's Italian Forum. I debated whether or not to try it as I have been severely disappointed by the food of some of the Food TV celebrities. But I thought what the heck. So my bud and I stopped in. We were warmly greeted by Dave who sat us. As we checked out the menu I looked around to see if people were enjoying their food and what they were eating. All seemed to be having a good time. I ordered the Pasta Arrabbiata and my mate the Pasta Bolognese. My pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked and had the right amount of heat I would expect. I really liked the addition of some local fresh chilis. My mate was not so happy with his selection as he said it was so so. I had no room for desert, but my bud ordered the Tiramisu, which he said was too creamy and disappointing. We split a bottle of Red wine and called it a night. Though my dish was good, it was nothing spectacular and nothing I could not make at home. Based on my mate's description of his food, I must say it was a disappointing meal. Good, but nothing special. The staff was super friendly and the atmosphere good
4
All Jamie's got this distinct style, good service with funny and friendly waiters. If you love jamie's somewhat rustic and 'messy' cooking style, then this place is for you. To be honest i think jamie's cooking is stuck somewhere between Good and super good. It's above average good but never gave any of that 'wow' effect to your palette. This is something that comes form experience since this is my second jamie's.But, sometimes you dine for the experience and the whole ambience. not solely for the food. For recommendation, i suggest you try anything they served special that day. Sometimes it might surprise you. Mine was a fresh fish baked with tomatoes, Italian style. Or when you lost, you can always ask the funny friendly people there what's good to order (they're all honest with their opinion) overall with Jamie's you will always leaving the restaurant happy
5
Really good dinner with family! Food was excellent, service fast and friendly and kids were served well. Special thanks for family & health oriented approach! Kids got their greens early and had already downed everything before main courses arrived. On top of this, prices of ready menu sets were really affordable compared to other restaurants of same quality.

2nd time to give a try again..Pretty impress this time round. Had the dinner set menu and was happy with everything. The crab and avocado bruschetta is good.. main was great and dessert is oh so delicious.. wild mushrooms risotto was full of flavor..Very crowded, probably due to the good set dinner cost. However the kids brownie with ice cream is great but bad in execution.. had trouble scooping and ice cream make a mess.Could improvise on this..Will Come back again..

They started off with reservation only via online and decline walk in guest.Nowadays , the door is open for all.I must say the food that was ordered and prepared is simple Italian fare , nothing fancy and it a quick bite & go. Standard of meals in general is acceptable 
5
Amazing food with great ambience. Service is excellent! The waiters are very attentive. Had a wonderful time with my family!
4
Really great food, good prices for singapore, great friendly staff. Good decor, very nicely presented restaurant. Very much a family restaurant where shorts n tee-shirts are the norm.
4
Excellent service with great service staff that did a very good recommendation of theIr special that day.

My companion ordered the mocha and I chose the flat white . Both were good. We shared a tiramisu. It was very nice although pricey at $11 plus a piece.

Came here with my wife for a quick lunch. First impression is very good with stylish wanna-be Italian decor and slow music playing. Despite the fact that there were hardly customers, we had to wait together with another two, who had even been seated in the meantime. 2 courses for SGD 22 does not include fries for the burger. And the burger was, my English fails me, but meaty in a pasty way. I dont mind half cooked beef burgers. But were not asked and the consistency troubled me, so I ate half. My wife said the carbonara was ok, but probably had a dash of lemon, which was not appreciated. She did not finish either. Brownie and Tiramisu for dessert did not help. That was NOT Tiramisu! Conclusion is that I will not come back. It was a disappointing experience. Especially since the brand Jamie gives good feelings and the looks of the restaurant is good. Hence my title which explains my experience here. Its not enough to have the exteriors and waiters aligned to the brand, the food must deliver according to what this restaurant should be about.

I've heard mixed reviews bout this place but of cos, I'd rather make my own judgement. And I'm so glad we went!! The food was DELICIOUS!! The pasta were so tasty and the patty in the hamburger was just juicy and succulent! Service however was somewhat disappointing. That's one area for improvement. But nevertheless, we'd still go back for the yummy yummy food
5
It is always a cheer eating here with my son. It is always a favorite to have the Penne Carbonara. Their pasta are all freshly made and aldente. We both love the pasta here.The steaks are my wifes favorite.While my interests are the olives and the mojitos. Now my favorite is the Super Food Salad. The best salad so far. Really love it.The staffs knows us already and are friendly and easy to talk too.We simply just love this place

Jamie's Italian may be part of Mr. Oliver's empire of restaurants, but the space is well laid out with comfortable booths, and the menu has a lot of good dishes freshly prepared. The place had a good atmosphere, lots of chat, but can also talk and the service, while not perfect, kept the dishes coming. Wine 2 for 1 before 7pm was also a bonus. We had pasta dishes and they were all very tasty with pasta cooked correctly. If you do not mind looking at lots of Jamie's photos on the produce for sale, seems much better than some of the restaurants further down the road

We enjoyed the 10% off from Chope voucher. Also they provide the complimentary EPIC BROWNIE for the birthday girl. Its definitely a good place for celebration :)
5
Have been here many times with the family. Very trendy looking, superb food, always. Seems very popular as always full. Even when told the wait is 30 minutes, normally get a table in 15. Lovely waiting area with leather sofas. You can order drinks and snacks while you wait. Nice kids menu and give-aways to keep them occupied so the grown-ups can chat. I normally have the ragu pasta or burger. Food quality is very consistent (and high standard). Its a 5 minute walk from the main shopping area on Orchard Road, so well located. Haven't tried it, but the bar seems interesting
5
Couldnt fault it, great meal great service. Ignore the silly reviews, it great. Had two wonderful meals, no booking but they fitted us in quickly and catered for my wifes intolerences
5
Full of expatriates and locals alike. The food here is great and tasty. It was also value for money, especially since we went with the evening set meal for $39.90.
Quite a good deal!
5
Having read the reviews of Jamie's we were not sure what to expect as they were very mixed. We have had a wonderful evening with the best food and service. I am lactose intolerant and they really looked after me. Prices are higher than in England but that is what you expect. The restaurant was really buzzing and busy and we were looked after and came away feeling really happy. With so may wonderful places to eat In Singapore it was nice to see the restaurant so busy so well done all the staff
2
We come here because they are local and have excellent service and they dote on the kids like they are royalty. The service staff are absolutely wonderful. The decor is industrial Italian and the vibe is nice.Unfortunately the food isn't what it should be.A few examples:The triple cooked hand cut chips were single cooked frozen bag chips. I refused to pay for them (this being our forth visit).The chicken Milanese with prosciutto was so tough I couldn't cut it with the serrated knife provided. I nibbled the edges and found a few parts I could cut through.On the upside our friend said his steak was decent and the kids like the spaghetti with meatballs although why said my bolognese was better.In short, the food needs work to match the rest of the experience and I don't enjoy being conned with triple cooked hand cut chips that are single cooked supermarket frozen chips
2
Very bad service. We use chope voucher, we told the staff, at the end they refused and we paid twice the dinner! No customer oriented, very disappointing!
1
Whenever I try to call at Jamie's, no one answers the phone. Going on site as a walk-in, you will end-up on a waiting list for at least 45 minutes. When confronting the service/receptionist ... you will get told that they would call you back as they track the phone attempts. Only that I have never been called back ... eventually I should be patient for some years? The food in general is average but the price a bit too high for the overall quality.
4
Like other reviewers, Jamie's Italian had a great atmosphere, happy/helpful staff and a large menu.Our daughter is severely allergic to nuts, and the restaurant was great in catering to her needs (by far the most helpful in Singapore!) Those who are GF, Vegan, Vegetarian or have any other allergies, I highly recommend this place.If hesitant on Pizza or Pasta, the pizza is delicious! Bookings aren't essential, but recommended a few days in advance (so no waiting
5
Love the food at Jamie's Italian. Staff were friendly and helpful as well. My friends from Bangladesh loved the meal. Keep up the great work
1
We went to the restaurant in Forum Orchard because our daughter is so eager to go after watching Jamie Oliver's tv programme. We read the poor reviews before we went there, so didn't have high expectations at all.The service turned out better than we expected: the waiters actually are all the time accessible and we are happy with it. However the food we ordered taste horrible, let's put it this way: they are worse than home or food court level, and very expensive for sure.So if you want to taste nice food with reasonable cost, you should never go to this restaurant. If you want to see how badly Jamie Oliver's restaurant in Singapore is running, please feel free to go.All in all, we are very very very disappointed!!
4
came here for my dad's birthday dinner treat! indicated during my online booking and commented if something can be done for my Dad! they indeed saw the comments and specially prepared a mini cake for my dad! really appreciate the staff and crew's dedicated. a Chinese male ( didnt get his name ) specifically whom was serving us, was detailed enough to go through our food and was attentive in all our orders and request! apart from the great service, sadly the food was just plain average. a Caucasian couple sitting beside us was making a hell lot of fuss about their food as well. the pizza was just average,the Italian steak being very very tough. lacks the wow factor as you would expect from Jamie Oliver's restaurant. overall, a decent place, though a tad noisy but the decoration was nice and ambiance was cosy. thumbs up for the service
4
Wonderful pasta with chilli slices, rich and creamy mushroom soup and finished off with Latte. Very nice!
5
Went for dinner with my 8y old son. They offered to do a half-sized carbonara which wasn't on the kids menu. The lamb chops were excellent.
The atmosphere was just a tad noisy but overall cost.
5
Love this restaurant, especially the Super Food Salad. One of the best salads have ever had! Its perfectly balanced with grains and avocado and yummy cheese. It really is the best salad i have ever had!!
5
What a great atmosphere, decor suits it so well. Had a great seafood pasta, the kids loved their pizzas and my wife enjoyed hers too. Nicely air conditioned, the food was fresh and of great quality. I loved the feel of the wall tiles, the entire decor and highly recommende
5
Two Mothers, Five children, what to do for lunch? Friends told us to head down to Jamie's. What a great choice the food was beautiful the children ate all there vegetables, no complaining from kids the service was perfect. the Man on the door Dave who found us a seat was the start of a great lunch he was so professional with the right mix of fun for children, Joy who was the waitress looking after us, got down next to the children and checked and double checked she understood them them, she had the right mix of sparkle and service ethic, She paid special attention to the children the whole time. She is in the right role and a job with people should be what she stays in for life.. I would recommend this place to everyone. we are about to move closer to town and can see this place becoming our regula
4
Came here for dinner with my partner. The service was prompt, informative and friendly. We shared the Italian nachos, which was nice. For main my partner had the prawn pasta, which he enjoyed and I and the Venetian fish stew, which was tasty, although a little salty for my liking. I had the orange tiramisu for desert, which was a unique spin on a classic but was lovely. My partner had the molten chocolate praline pudding, which was devine. Also, their espresso martini was amazing!
4
We were looking for a Sunday night family meal and spotted the words "vegan" on the online menu, so there was definitely something for everyone in the family here. A menu full of kid-friendly delights and steak for me, yet no visible vegan items on the menu. When we asked, staff were quick to send someone over who could modify the menu for the vegan in our party
4
It looks so inviting to peek in the window... cozy leather chairs to relax and have a cocktail and a quick bite to eat. And then, wow! What a taste sensation!!I'm not sure what they do to the carrots to make carrot and avocado salad so delicious. But I couldn't stop thinking about it and had it two days in a row. Flavors just pop. Heaven for a vegan!I had a mojito with my lunch. It's made with prosecco. Not sure why, but tastes like it has cinnamon in it. Super delicious. Had two. I've also had the mushroom risotto. They made it without cheese for me (vegan) and it was sooo good. It has a melange of mushrooms, but is topped with sliced, grilled trumpet mushrooms. Again, heaven. My colleagues rave about the pizzas, so I have to believe they're good. The crust looks really good. Quite a hearty meal for one as they're quite big... but delicious enough to do it! I wish two things for Jamie's... first.. to put stools at the bar or get more cozy leather lounge seats. Second, if you aren't sitting in the lounge area, there's little atmosphere to speak of.. other than the heavenly garlic smells from the open kitchen. The staff is quite friendly and attentive, and service is quick. Consistently good. I'll return again and again.
2
It looked good from the outside, and indoor it had the feel of a crowded, rustic trattoria. As soon as I read through the menu I realised that the only Italian thing in this restaurant was the hanging Garlic from the counter! The food was very average, we frankly left most of it on our plates...Staff was friendly. Worth going if you are not a foodie
5
My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here last week and the experience just made our night even more special. Not only were the waitstaff professional yet warm, they were knowledgeable regarding gluten allergy and they try to avoid cross-contamination as much as possible.
4
We like the food, it's so delicious!
I hope more promotions in the future.
Will definitely come back again for sure!
5
Lovely food and staff. They close pretty soon I wish they were open a little longer into the night. Do try their pizzas and garlic breads!
5
Excellent ambiance and service. Staff cooperated and helped me set up the perfect birthday celebration for my girlfriend.
4
Had a nice lunch with my wife and daughter. Service, food and ambience was very good and the vide variety of starters can be recommended to share. Will be back.
5
We happened to come across this restaurant just by chance as we were strolling on orchard street 3 days back and decided to go in. Amazing place ... Beautiful decor, very friendly staff and to top it off - the very best Italian we have had on our trip. We tried the pizzas, breads ... But hope to go back tonight for a proper dinner before we fly home tmwr. Shall always want to come back.
5
Recently I had the pleasure of eating at Jamie Oliver's, along with my wife and 2 young children. The staff were outstanding and the foods excellent. The portions were big and very tasty. There was a good choice of foods for my 7 year olds. It's the staff which made this visit special. They were so attentive and wonderful to my children. We will be back for certain
4
Went there for my partners birthday. Had a great meal which although not the cheapest was really good and well priced in my opinion. I mentioned the birthday and a cake was bought out with a candle etc and finished the meal off in a great fashion. Couldn't fault it although would recommend booking in advance as very busy.
5
I thoroughly enjoyed the food and service by the staff. Hazel provided amazing service to ensure that our meal was an enjoyable one. The food was fantastic! We had the prawn linguine and chicken milanese for the mains. And for desserts we had the most amazing tiramisu and cheesecake. Everything was done to perfection! Thank you for making our day!

Ordered a mushroom tagliatelle for lunch with a business associate. Was impressed with a great mushroom flavored pasta dish with a table spoon of bread crumbs on the side, adding good texture.However, the rainbow slaw was disappointing. It's too tart and acidic. Wait help offered to replace and yet, the second dish tasted as sour as the first in the dressing. The cold kitchen chef needs to review this.
2
My mother and I looked forward to our dinner here and left very disappointed. The service was lack lustre and at times inept. Most importantly, the food was so well below average that even I, definitely not a good cook, could have made better with even simple ingredients. Food was bland bordering on tasteless. Small portions too. I hate when celebrities throw their name behind ventures this and then expect to make money on the draw of their name. I expected far better from Jamie
4
We ordered pastas, a pizza & a burger. Our was was yummy, drinks was great & the service was excellent
2
The soup was OK the main was lamb chops but should have been called burnt hoggit.. high price to pay for such a seriously bad meal, shame Jamie shame. .
5
We made a reservation online and was greeted with such efficiency upon our arrival. Minimal waiting time, friendly staffs! Staff took his time to go through the specialities for the day and knows well enough about every dish that we asked. Probably the best customer service experience I had in Singapore. Aside to their wonderful staffs, food were excellent. We ordered the Lamb Chop ($39) and Pimped Margherita Pizza (around $24). Portion was huge and some might consider sharing that pizza for two! Lamb chop was seasoned well and that meat.. oooh just cooked to perfection.The best side dish will be their ultimate GARLIC BREAD (the best you will ever taste) at $9.90!If you are celebrating your birthday, lucky for you.. FREE BIRTHDAY BROWNIE. A pan of fudgy goodness topped with ice cream and popcorns.Conveniently located at Forum, Orchard (facing the main road). Just remember to make a reservation beforehand.
5
Lovely atmosphere, great food and coffee. Service was great also. Just right in all aspects. Food was well presented and they made it as per our likes.
3
We didn't make reservations but we were seated within 5 minutes of waiting at the bar. Our waitress was friendly and took our order quickly. There was a little mix up where we received an extra serve of garlic bread which was actually somebody else's order, but was swiftly taken away once the error was realized. The garlic bread was nice, as a starter. My husband ordered the chicken Milanese, which was a little overpowered by the Parmesan cheese, and was slightly on the bland side. It was only a small piece of chicken breast and he would of ordered a side of vegetables or fries if he had of realized, as it only comes with a little bowl of sauce. I ordered the tagliatelle bolognese, which was nice there was plenty of pasta there so shared some with my husband and still couldn't all that was left! After our initial drinks order, we were never asked if we would like more drinks, it also took a while between asking for the bill, and receiving it, however we could see the waitress was busy with quite a few other customers so we could completely understand the delay.Overall the service was friendly but the food was pretty average even for a Jamie Oliver restaurant
2
I'm Italian and despite stereotypes that follow us everywhere we do have a fetish for good food. Alas, this is not the case at Jamie's on Orchard. Service ok but the pizza was something from the twilight zone.Poorly cooked, tomato sauce tasteless that made the pizza soggy, and poor quality mozzarella (was it mozzarella or fontina? Hard to tell).Margherita pizza should be the easiest to make... Come on guys... You have 6 types of pizzas in total and should be able to make them right.On the bright side... The location is good and the place is well kept
3
The food was well prepared and delivered without too much waiting. So far so good. Wait staff were mixed , some helpful and friendly , some somewhat indifferent. The real let down with this place is the way that tables are cramped in to the available space. I had to stand up at one stage to let the people at the next table get seated. At the prices charged here they need to provide more space between tables, this is not a "Toast Box"! Maybe try again, but not of they don't sort the seating.
5
It was a birthday dinner for my son and somehow one of the waiter was so attentive and surprised him with a cake. He has a blast as we love the service and food. I will highly recommend anyone who wants to have a great Italian experience to visit there.
3
I had high expectations of this restaurant, as anyone who knows of Jamie Oliver should, and my visit did not live up to this. It was just myself so I got a seat at the bar, no problem. I called ahead to see if there was such a spot available and prefer bar seating when I travel solo. I ordered the special bianca pizza and I have to say it was quite bland. Prices here are on par with other restaurants as Singapore is a very expensive city, including for alcoholic drinks. I also had the molten chocolate praline cake, which was chocolate only, no praline. Service was fast and friendly. The restaurant has a very modern, airy Italian feel, which I really enjoyed until 7pm when they began to play pop music.
5
Well, I have been to the one at HarbourFront and tried the fried squid and REMEMBERED it!! So, this time, I reordered that, along with bruschetta and a pizza for the two of us to share.It is STILL good....(the squid) and the bruschetta is not bad either but it isn't what you'd expect of an Italian bruschetta...I would call this an American bruschetta - fried bread so its crispy and some tomatoes and stuff on top with cheese. Not exactly how I'd like my bruschetta (since Im an avid Italian fan!!) but pass.Pizza was great - thin and crispy and nice and juicy. Can't complain Especially when it came with a one-for-one glass of wine since it's happy hour!! Service staff was helpful when ordering!! Glad we listened to her. Friendly and cheerful peeps!! Love them!Will definitely be bac
5
Great food, great service which is standardise across all Jamie Olivers cafes. Highly recommended for the juice
4
We had a fine meal at Jamie's Italian at Orchard Road, in Singapore, with fresh ingredients, very tasty. A good value for money. Great service, as you can expect in Singapore.
5
Waiters were attentive and the food was freshly prepared. The food was also well presented. The restaurant was intricately decorated.
4
This is the most down to earth Jamie's I have ever been. It's small and cosy. Staff are all very friendly with young children. Simple menu with enough choice. It's a great place for a quick meal between shoppings. It's in such a great location, very kids friendly mall. Great family hang out place. Recommend only for lunch though. It's too simple and too noisy for dinner, in my opinion only.
4
Nicely situated on Orchard Road. It was fairly busy for a Wednesday night quite early and the reason was plain to see: the food was really good.I had the Snapper and my wife the Salmon special. The snapper was really tasty and the sauce was nice and light; ate it like a soup and just great. My wife thought the salmon was beautifully cooked. The garlic bread as an entrée was good. The staff were really helpful. Thought the drinks were a bit expensive
1
Had high expectation of Jamie Oliver's restaurant. There were 8 of us, and none of the food ordered was decent. Dry steak, terrible pasta, smelly fish. Huge disappointment
3
This is my 3rd time in Jamie's and unfortunately i am less and less impressed. First the menu got shorter or less interesting. There used to be good interesting pizzas in the past . I could not find any good pizza to order other than Margarita. Secondly is the taste of the food. It is now very much skewed to the south eat asia fried food taste. this is alienating it from Italian taste .
3
We have been several times. It is very convenient for us as we live close by. The food is average and the service is average. The sirloin steak is consistently good. The pasta tends to be over sauced. The service is hit and miss. We will go again, for the Convenience for than for the food. The biggest issue is the price of a meal - for a family of five with two pasta, a pizza, steak and two appetizers prepare to pay over 200sgd ( no wine, and it is a bit pricey as well). It is not a budget conscience restaurant. If you are light eaters the dishes are quite big and can easily be shared. Just don't go with a hungry bunch of kids (we did not eat off the kids menu, so that would save a few dollars as well). Enjoy
4
We had the pasta, steak and the famous free range chicken. Pasta was good, although the linguine is rather thick. The dessert is good especially the tiramisu. Served by Hazel, very helpful and knowledgeable of the food
3
Firstly, I've eaten at five other Jamie's Italian restaurants previously, a total of about 20 times. On arrival we were seated quickly despite no reservation. The waitress brought us menus but didn't mention anything about specials until we asked. Ordering was easy and quick and starters came out swiftly. Had the antipasti meat board to share. It was as good as always!When our mains came out I was a little bit disappointed to discover that my Caesar salad had bits of raw cauliflower in it. I triple checked the menu to see if i'd missed the mention of this - I hadn't. I don't feel like the flavour or texture went well at all. Husband ordered a pizza which he really enjoyed. We were eating the last mouthful of the main when the waitress asked us if we wanted to place any final orders. It was 21.55 and the restaurant closed at 23.00 so we found this a bit odd and felt very rushed. I did ask her why this was the case and she said that the chef wanted to finish up!Overall the food was nice but service was sub standard. Usually we are met by enthusiastic, efficient staff members but not on this occasion. Half of them looked like they were just on countdown to the end of the shift.
5
Enjoyed our visit. Good food. Great service. Friendly staff. Special shout out to Hazel. See you again on our next visit.
4
There is something for every one at Jamie's Italian Forum. It is a modern take, on Italian classics.
4
The most thing I liked in this restaurant is the starter! , is really yummy and you will feel full after you had it ! , the main dish we ordered pasta and pizza and they were good but nothing special about them .
4
The service and the food were equivalent awesome... Ordered the tiramisu and Pana cotta, Panna cotta was really good! The lamb chop was fantastic! The birthday Mloten was lovely...
1
Place is nice and service definitely caring. Ordered a pizza Margherita. Who made it obviously has never tasted an Italian pizza. Tomato sauce with spices in (omg), dry and stiff. Claiming italian food is easy, cook it is not that complicated but here at least the pizza you don't have a glue of what is
3
The usual fans of the Jamie's Italian who have come to expect the level of service that they find in something like the brand's London's Covent Garden location may find something to be missing here. The food is good and consistent. Staff might not notice you for 15 minutes after seating you, and will then continue to miss assisting you for long periods between courses. It's not what I've come to expect from previous Jamie's experiences, but thankfully the kitchen staff is delivering high quality food. The Italian Nachos (delicious cheese filled fried ravioli with a devilishly spice tomato based sauce, were good, and the night's special lasagna with fresh lasagna noodles was enjoyable (if not a very long time in coming). Super convenient location next to the Hilton is a great alternative to the hotel's also good options. The food makes up for the unfortunate and avoidable service shortcomings.
4
We have been to this restaurant a few times since it's opening and have enjoyed it's quality and variety of entrees in the menu. I particularly liked their hamburger, pork chop and most recently tried the lamp chops. They were grilled to perfection in good sized portions, accompanied with sautéed veggies. The prawn pasta ordered was also fresh and tasty , service was efficient and hospitable ,making our visit highly enjoyable .Located at the Forum mall next to Hilton Hotel , the convenient location is hard to miss
1
Bad coffee, expensive, food not good - very salty. Only redeeming feature was free wifi. Will not be returning
1
Service was abrupt and arrogant from the 3 waiters who attended us.This is my 3rd visit, including 1 in London. My review is consistent for all 3 visits. I ordered a steak and when asked how I would like it cooked, I said "medium to well-done". Got attitude from the waiter who feigned misunderstanding me and proceeded to correct me, saying it's "medium to well" that's said.Food arrived, bland. Pizza bland. Ceasar salad: small portion, not fresh.Steak: super well done. I guess I upset the kitchen with my lack of cuisine vocabulary! Don't go! Don't waste your time & money. Where is Jaimie? Seems like he's deserted this restaurant. I'm super disappointed as I pretty learned my cooking from Jaimie
5
The food was delicious, and unlike many Italian restaurants, the noise level was manageable. A nicely decorated venue with attention to detail, and the staff were delightful. Good variety in the menu, lots of flavour, and caters for all age groups. Family friendly. Mid range cost wise, but pricing was in keeping with the area
5
There must be cheaper places in SG to eat Pizza and other italian dishes but this is really nice, obviously trendy fancy for reasonable prices. Will go back.
3
the Singapore Jamie is kinda disappointing. Not as good, service is not attentive enough as well ..was there 5 times and it didn't wow me at all
5
Lovely relaxed lunch with great food and service. Our table was ready on arrival and the service was excellent. We all live Jamie's ❤️❤️
5
Delicious variety of food & beverage and friendly, knowledgeable service. We made on the spot plans to visit again!
5
The food quality was very good especially the short ribs. My friends found the lemon meringue cheesecake too sour though. It did taste a bit more sour than the ones I had previously.
The service staff were attentive.
5
I'm an Aussie living in Singapore for 5 years, and so happy to discover this restaurant. The food was delicious, the service was swift and courteous and the ambience is nice. The superfood salad was crazy delicious. Small gripe: the banana-almond milkshake wasn't available. It's not cheap, but appropriately priced for this standard restaurant in this location. I'll definitely be back.
5
On our recent visit to singapore, decided to visit jamie's Italian, we choose the one in forum and its located in the busy street of orchard road and its very conveniently located. Food was delicious and its truly a Italian taste and flavors. The servers and the service was attentive and welcoming.Ohh the decor was very convincing and you feel like you are in Italy with a huge display of the food.Will defenetly recommend to try
3
We ordered the chili crab special n it was not good at all. The crab meat was soft n mushy and it smelled of ammonia. Not fresh st all. We did highlight that when the servers asked us ant it but its only that it will be "high lighted to the kitchen"..
5
Excellent food, original for Singapore and delicious and excellent service responsive and personable
4
During my recent trip to Singapore during the Holy Week this year, I tried Jamie's restaurant i.e. The Forum near the Hilton in Orchard Road. It was a late afternoon lunch and I tried one of their house specialties i.e. the prawn linguine which has garlicky prawns, shaved fennel, tomatoes, chili and fennel. The pasta was freshly made. The sauce was just right, not too sour nor bland. The price of the dish including a drink is around SGD 30-32. The ambiance of the place was very homey, family oriented. The food servers were mostly Filipinos. I asked whether Jamie has visited this place and they said he hasn't. In my next visit, will try the other dishes and visit the other branch at Vivo City to check on food consistency
3
The service and atmosphere (and the aromas!) were lovely, but the food was just okay. Overpriced for the taste, decent portion size.
4
A bustling, busy restaurant, service with a smile.
Staff very polite, food delicious, service was prompt.
Lovely meal.
4
Nice taste , Goodyear service , unique menu that offers diversity and also tradition .
The place is in the center of Orchid Road.
4
Excellent service! Seats and tables would preferably be more spacious. Ventilation could be better as the kitchen is pretty close to the seats. Good food overall especially the italian steak and beef short ribs
5
Arrived and seated immediatley at a table for 3. Took our chances on having not made a reservation, so was thrilled that we didn't have to wait. Great attentive service and wonderful food. Prices were reasonable. Had free awesome desserts by redeeming the 'Jamies' voucher on the Singapore Tourist map. The steak was top notch. A lovely way to end our last nights holiday. Highly recommend this restaurant
5
We had decided to come here for a meal before we left from New Zealand on our South East Asia cruise. Three of us ate, and we used a discount voucher to redeem a free dessert with every main. OMG! It was delicious. We had just got off a cruise ship, so didn't know what to expect from Jamie's place. We were delighted with the food, desserts and the wine we got to accompany it all. Even struck up a good conversation with a couple of locals at the next table. We had heard there could be a wait, but we were seated immediately! Yay! So thanks Jamie's crew, we had a great time
4
A busy and lively Italian style restaurant with attentive and efficient staff, we enjoyed the buzz , the beer and the comprehensive menu on offer.Good value overall and tasty freshly prepared dishes my pasta Arabiatta was first rate and a rival for the real thing in Italy
5
Busy restaurant at weekend, got in without too much of a wait or reservation. Food pretty good, Italian with a slight twist. My son reckoned it was the best steak he'd ever had.Certainly worth a visit if your looking for an Italian restaurant in Orchard Roa
5
Lovely restaurant, rustic and cosy ambience. Personnel speaks very good English and know every detail of the dishes they sell. We've dined here 3-4 times and left very happy with every meal. The food is tasty, fresh, light, particularly enjoyed their salads. Sensible price level. Nice coffee and desert menu. Definitely a place to visit
5
From not interested I actually went twice in July with both family and business staff. First class food and service and wholly unexpected from this place (sorry), I can't recommend highly enough. I went to the one on Orchard road and both times Beverly good value. If I was a local I would go there often.I know every time I go to Singapore this will be on my standard list with Jumbo Dempsey Hill",

Perfect dinner and dessert . Definitely a must visit again place.
Keep up the good standards Jamie
Shall visit again.
Service was great too.
5
ive been there with my family..the food is good and is really nice...reallly want to get back there to enjoy another dish..
4
Food was wonderful. I especially loved the Italian steak. Great family meal with kid friendly choices. Servers were friendly too.
5
Great food at reasonable pricing.
Kids loved the fresh spaghetti and risotto was great.
Deserts are a reasonable size for all ages.
3
Started with a bruchetta of ricotta and tomato which was just too small for an entree. Then had the recommended venetian duck pasta which would have been great for the fact that the cook rushed it and it was just tooo al dente. Maybee they'll get it right next tim
5
Family dinner here one night while visiting Singapore. The food was delicious, fresh and tasty. They initially sat us right next to another table and felt very close and uncomfortable but quickly moved us to a booth which was nice. Friendly staff and they looked after the kids, loved it. Expensive food, but that's Singapore for you
5
My friends and I came here mid week for lunch. We didn't book but was able to get a table.They have two lunch time specials a two course meal for $21 and a three course meal for $27.My friend had the soup which was a beef soup. She said it was lovely. We did ask if there was a vegetarian soup available but there wasn't.I had the fried three cheese ravaloi. This was really tasty and a good size portion. I recommend ordering this. Beware this is a little spicy which I love.A lady then began serving our main course, didn't clear our starters which we had finished. It would appear the staff don't work as a team but just do the job they are allocated to do. One person takes the orders, one person serves the food, one person clears a table etc. My two friends had a pasta dish and my friend and I had the super food salad. My salad was very good.For dessert we all had the brownie which was also very good.There is some improvements needed in the service but apart from that it was very good
5
Visually appealing. If ur coming from 'traditional' big cheesy creamy flavors...u mite be surprised at the delicacy of Jamie's at forum. Well thought out menu IMO dat highlights the fresh ingredients nicely. The super salad was fresh and filling..citrus dressing going smoothly with the velvety smoked salmon. Caesar clda used bit more dressing but nevertheless a modern spin on an age old classic that adds to its density and freshness. Funky wedges r super garlicky...I enjoyed dat...watch out tho if on a first date. Now..the lemon cheesecake with fresh made meringue... served over lemon curd and berries compote..yum. finish off ur palate with an affogato poured over real vanilla ice cream...happy days

I went to Jamie's Italian because I wanted to eat a little lighter ... maybe a little too.In fact, I took the "Meat Plank" but in the end it was a slice of raw prosciutto, two slices of bresaola, a mozzarellina and two olives for about 16.50S$ (~11€) and "Funky Chips" i.e. the "rustic" chips for 7.75S$ (~6€).Overall worth a stunted sufficiency
3
I didn't know what to expect at Jamie's Italian. I know it's owned by a TV Chef but I watch very little TV so you can say I am unbiased.First couple of times we came here was for an afternoon snack. The nibbles are good. The arancini balls were good. Service from one particular staff was very good.The next few times we went was for dinner. The bolognese and carbonara were average. The prawn linguini was pretty good though. I also tried the pork chop which is just a bit above average. One thing they all have in common is the overly-generous portion. I can't believe someone complained here that the portions are too small. I think the portion size here is for sharing.Service wise, I think it's really just okay. Apart from the very first waiter who served us, the staff seem somewhat disinterested in general overall. They're also not very good at clearing empty bottles, glasses or plates.The overall feel to the place is a bit like TGI Friday's. It's not a bad thing but good to know that so you don't expect too much. It's still okay for hearty meals though
2
Wasn't satisfied with the portion sizes and general taste. Incredulous that a restaurant by a famed chef would be this lacklustre.
1
Rude people.... No sense of customer service... It took me 20mins+ to order as the servers were too occupied my family literally had to ask every waiter to take the order.... Very bad service
5
Fantastic food - amazing taste, incredibly good service and reasonable price point. Ordered the 'worlds best olives' as per menu statement - and have to agree... wow! Had a pizza - very traditional and wonderful taste. I will be back. Delicimo!
4
Very good Italian food their signature dishes are costly but worth trying at least once.slightly of high quality hence a bit heavy on budget.Plan properly
5
Perfect lunch where family and friends celebrated mother's day.
Nice food and worthed cost per individual.
4
Lucky I came in early as the restaurant had a small queue before 7pm on a Friday night. Food is rustic and portions are about right. I only found the atmosphere slightly warm maybe as I was sitting near the kitchen. Overall it was a good experience.

Been wanting to try a "Jamie's Italian" as Iw anted to see what all the fuss was about and whether one of Jamie's restaurants lived up to his name.Took a while to call in to reserve a table as no one answer the phone for more than 5 minutes. Once through though, it was brisk and efficient.When we arrive, though we had booked they gave us a tiny table (for 4) which we then asked to have changed to a less tiny table (the first table they subsequently gave to a couple). The place was absolutely packed and had the full spectrum of young kids through to business people. The sound level was way too high, with so many people it was just a buzz of noise, though the music was cranked up to compete with it.The waitress had to literally shout to be heard and so did we at the table trying to talk with each other - not a something I like at all.The menu was not that extensive and appeared to be a play on standard fair, tarted up a lot.We started off with a bread basket (not free) and some italian nachos. The bread was OK though took some effort to get some olive oil which seemed to be rationed out. The Italian Nachos were a bit meh, though the tomato salsa had a good zing to it.The kids both took tagliatelli bolognese which was declared really good and I thought it was too.I took the burger which was a skyscraper of a meal which needed some deconstruction as there was on way that could be crushed down into a bitable burger - I have to admit it was pretty good. I liked the fries with rosemary and garlic too.My wife took the super foods salad with chicken. A bit sparse on the chicken, but overall very tasty.Dessert were a tad too fussy so they got skipped.Service was brisk .. it sort of felt like being at the Hard Rock they push you through so fast, though not as friendly or efficient.The bill was a pleasant surprise SGD 194 for 4 of us.The bliss was when we walked out into the "peace and quiet" of Orchard Road.In summary, far too noisy, service rather disengaged and too much like a QSR. Probably worth another visit

Having dined at the Vivo branch a couple of times, and not terribly impressed, I was a little apprehensive about visiting this new branch. But was pleasantly surprised by the food. We shared a crab pasta (loved by my dining companions), Italian sausage pizza (yums), calamari (nice), garlic bread (nice). Good food & lovely ambience (though a bit loud when there're children around as it's rather family-friendly), but a tad pricey, I must say
5
I have now been to both Jamie's Italian restaurants in Singapore, and they each have a distinct feel. Vivo City's seems more upscale while Forum (ironically, given its location) feels more family friendly. I went with friends and were quickly seated and served attentively, and we sat for about 3 hours talking and eating. The food was exquisite. The antipasti was the perfect beginning to the meal. The Carbonara was silky and rich with bacon flavor, the ravioli was light but filling, and the cannelloni was the a trio of unique but scrumptious takes on a classic dish.I highly recommend it: the only thing that would have topped it all would have been to see Jamie Oliver himself in the kitchen
4
Great place to eat. Fantastic ambiance and excellent service. Food quality is very good with home made pasta cooked nicely. The meat dishes were were very good and I strongly recommend the deep fried squid. Excellent deserts too! Will go back for sure
5
Food was great. Reservation was quick. We were 10 people, and the service was good. Price was too expensive.
4
great place to eat, maybe not really Italian, though pizza dough was good and well cooked. Meat was very well cooked and tasty. went there twice.
4
I went for the first time to Jamie's Italian last Thursday for my birthday. We booked online, which is very practical and very necessary.Upon our arrival we were quickly taken to our seats, and we could see a lot of people waiting for tables. The staff is extra helpful, very knowledgeable of the day's specials, and I even saw a waitress holding a baby so a mother could finish her meal. The food is unpretentious, the atmosphere is young, modern and relaxing. The service is extremely quick and although our pizza could have more toppings ( it was the day's special with procciuto), the dough is baked to perfection. As a treat I got a tasty chocolate cake with ice-cream served on a charming wooden tray. Parking is a breeze, inside Forum Mall parking lot. I totally recommend this restaurant
3
We visited on a weekday for lunch and ordered the set menu. Started off with an ala carte order of garlic bread which was nice because it didnt taste like the usual garlic bread. Then we had mushroom soup and fritto misto as our appetizers, tagliatelle bolognese and penne carbonara as our mains and a brownie for dessert. Mushroom soup was delicious, smooth and packed with mushroomy flavour but batter and seafood used for the fritto misto missed the mark. The penne was al dente but tagliatelle seemed overcooked and was breaking into smaller pieces as i tried forking them off the plate. Otherwise the sauces with the pasta was tasty albeit too much to swallow towards the end. My husband enjoyed the fudgy brownie but I didn't quite fancy the taste of it. May return in the not so near future to try other items on the menu
4
I don't normally eat in this type of restaurant when away as we try to eat local food , but I wasn't feeling great and wanted something plain . It hit the spot . It was very busy and we had booked luckily , the only down side was they tried to give us a table far away in the corner which my husband did't want , they said they didn't have another table so he said not to worry we would go somewhere else and then they found another table ! Apart from that the food was good and the service also . It was expensive , but the £ against the S$ is rubbish so that is what made it worse .

We have been to Jamie's Italian in Sydney and were blown away by the service and food there. I think this set us up for a slightly disappointing evening at this one. Compared to Sydney, the cured meats platter was not as generous, and they did not have the pasta I liked from the Sydney restaurant. The service was good, but not especially attentive - we were done with our drinks a full five minutes before anyone came to ask us if we were ok. Overall not a bad experience, but not an especially memorable one either
5
We live in Sydney and have been to Jamies in Sydney.We wanted to try Italian in Singapore so thought we we go where we know..and we weren't disappointed.My parents had the 2 course menu and I had an entree.The food was delicious...and my father who was born in Italy is still raving about his spaghetti bolognaise....great job!!
3
Friendly service. Colouring pencils and paper for the kids was nice. Most of the meals were ok except for the soft lettuce Caesar Salad I had. Unfortunately I've been spoilt by some exceptionally good salads in comparison. (the best being Hard Rock Cafe in Maui, Hawaii). Having Jamie Oliver's name over the door does flavour the imaginations with high expectations. I hope this review helps to exceed the expectations
5
When you love Italian food like I do, and are also a fan of Chef Jamie Oliver himself, this is a must-try. I discovered his restaurant for the first time when I was in Sydney, and I really liked the concept - So when I heard that they had a sister restaurant in Singapore as well, I was really excited to go again! I went to the one located just near Ion or Orchard, for a casual/fun dinner with some of my friends. It is really a cool place to socialize, the atmosphere is very cosy and trendy at the same time. The staff is friendly and the service was quite fast. In terms of food, we tried the pastas and pizzas, both were quite delicious so it was hard to choose! I’d recommend you to grab some colleagues and friends and share the yumminess ;) My favorite was the pimped Margherita with its thin-crust and fresh tomatoes! If you are looking for a simple but chic gathering with good food, this is the place to be - apparently they also have a Vivocity outlet that I plan to try as well
4
Tried our luck on busy fathers day and got seats (2) at the bar. Had prawn spaghetti and the rib eye steak (special of the day). All served quickly and efficiently by the staff even though the place was very busy. This was our 2nd visit and we were very happy with the food and service
4
A good value lunch special here. The food was of the expected standard for a 'Jamies Kitchen' but service is a little slow.
2
My third visit was such a disappointment, the waitress whilst taking our drink order just left the table before we could finish ordering our drinks and we had to call her back to complete our drink order. We normally have a paste dish when we eat at Jamie's so we decided to try the pizza, I must say we didn't get value for money, the quality of the cheese used was poor
1
London outlet is awesome so decided to give the SG outlet a try. Was awful. Food was so badly cooked (eg overfried and hard as rock chicken chop was given instead of a whole free range chicken like in london. And paid so much for this chicken chop. It was a terrible experience and its to the extent i would never ever go back there again and would tell people never to go there to get ripped off
4
I have been to Jamie's for several times. I have to say that the food is not impressive at all. The staff is prompt and good but overall the restaurant has a very family atmosphere...Everytime a lot of kids and babies crying and a lot of noise.Overall I think there is place for improvements as everyone is expecting too much from the Jamie Oliver name
3
Went to Jamie's with friends based on last minute decision to eat out mid week.The atmosphere was very good and relevant seating and service was very quick.The food portions were good however I was not used to being served my steak already cut up.Overall a pretty good feed and I would recommend the Arincini
4
As ever, consistently yummy food and a very good family atmosphere. Will be back again soon without doubt. The squid is a family favourite
5
I've been waiting to come here for a while now, and finally they had a restaurant in Singapore! Jamie Oliver is world recognized and he does not need an introduction of any sort! Having the opportunity to taste is food is magical. Being a foodie this is heaven on earth.. Everything was just perfect and in all honesty the food was worth every penny! When I say every penny it means every single one of it.. It's not over priced at all and with a starter and a main you are literally stuffed. The nachos and the bruschetta are a MUST TRY! The pastas are something you have have to try too and the carbonara is what I had.. I would say have a pizza or a pasta and guaranteed it's a solid Italian meal. Loved the atmosphere as well! Can't to be back here!
4
When you go in to places like these it is not for fine dining. This is more or less a 'mass product' but a good one. The place itself is packed with tables and it gets really noisy.So just go in for a quick meal don't go there for work lunches or romantic dinners.We took crockets with spinach an ricotta and crispy squid; both were packed with flavor and nicely prepated. As a main I had a trio of canemoni and my husband had the prawn linguini. We both really liked our food.Looking for fine dining? Book somewhere else (eg Jaan). Looking for something good and quick to eat in the neighbourhood of Orchard road (and you're a fan of italian food ) ? Try this one there's a good chance you'll like i
4
More like 3.5 stars, not quite 4, but better than 3. I had some time in Singapore so I decided to try this place. The place has great atmosphere but Overall, the food was a bit average & I sort of expected a little more. I did the two course special which on the whole was good value. I ordered the fritto misto which lacked a bit of flavor but it was cooked well. I then ordered the super food salad & the size was great, however the thing that wasn't well balanced was the dressing, way too much vinegar, so it let the entire dish down. Price was a little expensive for the food, nearly $50 AUD.... Which included a glass of NZ merlot. Service was very good. Be prepared for lots of noise from kids
5
always love watching jamie oliver and love to visit his restaurants. dont go without a reservation as waiting can be 45 min minimum. good homestyle italian food. very kid friendly. great ambiance. loved the pizzas and the appetisers. tough portions are small so you need to order more, thus it gets a bit expensive. but great taste and unique food. best italian. even decent variety for vegetarians
4
I have been eating in this restaurant a few times as it is close to my hotel. the choice of food is not enormous, but the different dishes are of excellent taste and good quantity.
5
Food was great. The kids loved the little pockets they received...
The service was surprisingly good because the place was soo crowded with families and yet we were served very quickly. Will be back
4
From the delicious Italian restaurants that I have visited this year. There is a taste of authentic Italian. It's beautiful romantic resturant good for occasions Located in the center Aorchad street price appropriately and the food is yammy . Most orderd is tha rosotto.
3
To be honest i choose this restaurant in order to see the philosophy and style of Jamie's restaurant a i was curious. He is very "famous" somehow. Unfortunately it was little bit disappointing. By no way the food is bad, however is not what you expect, As Greece, where i am from, has excellent Italian restaurants my expectations was high. I think that is overpriced as well for what its offers however in Singapore everything is not cheap. I chose one Bolognese Tagliatelle which was tasty but not something special. Service is good and place was crowded and people seems to enjoy their food
3
The atmosphere in the Restaurant is OK- cool facilities but the tables are too close.The Pasta-noodles are fresh and really outstanding- we had a tomato shrimp pasta which was excellent and a Carbonara, this was a creamy sauce close to 'alla panna' but never a 'Carbonara'. Cesar Salad was fresh with an interesting taste. The Panna Cotta with fresh fruits was good but not outstanding and the Tiramisu was like a cake with orange taste?? Sorry unacceptable - The Espresso was great - my respect to the Barista
5
Had dinner on last Wed/Thu; and probably the best "Butter Garlic Bread" we have ever had in town! They were so soft; buttery; and garlicky! Yum yum! And the pasta .were so deliciously cooked - fresh ingredients and tasty! We had "Prawn Linguine" and "Crab Spaghetti". In addition, the service were great from the door to the table. Thanks to the host (a tall & big guy) who transferred us to a table from a counter top. Frankly, we did not even asked for that! Also, thank you to the server (I think his name is Johnny) who was so attentive. Fabulous dining experience, indeed. Thank you so much again and shall return soon (with more friends)
1
It is disappointing. They cut corners on quality of ingredients, the service is poor and portions really small
2
What a terrible welcome experience; from such a hyped up restaurant.- Had booked for a table for family dinner 2 days before. Received a call to confirm the booking in the afternoon.- Arrived 5 minutes before the schedule time. Attendant at the reception asked us to wait at the waiting area, and indicated that table will be assigned once others waiting there are assigned. Although I had to wait only for about 10 minutes, what is the point of pre-booking ?- Once I was assigned a table, the chairs were covered with crumbs and not cleaned after the last service. I had to call someone to clean it up.- Restaurant decor is average.- Food is ok but failed to any of Jamie's charm in them.Overall, an average restaurant food with Food Court service
2
Ugh! What a huge disappointment. Small tables, crowded together and loud. The service was great for singapore! Very attentive server and timely. Too bad the food was bad. I LOVE an olive tapenade! I get it at every restaurant I see it at. i have never had a bad one, until now! The taste of vinegar was SO overpowering, it was terrible. The crackers that accompany it are thin, dry, and tasteless. They give you large green olives with it and they were rotten. My pasta was gummy and the bolognese sauce was plain, boring and tasteless. My husbands fish stew was filled with the leftovers. Very expensive for what you get. Try somewhere else
3
But kinda lacked the flavour punch Jamie talks about.Express lunch chosen, staff were attentive. Very clean and spacious place. Pricing is okay for Singapore. As you can see I had the ricotta bruschetta and the chicken in a brioche bunThe menu is a good size and all pasta made fresh on premise daily
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the meal and setting. The pizza was great, as was the Sirloin stake. The recommendations from the host were excellent and no down side to the visit.
5
Even though Jamie's is better at Vivo City in terms of location and ambiance, I prefer going to their Forum branch because of their service. Special thanks to Hazel who is very attentive to our needs. She is very courteous and she makes sure that we are comfortable
5
We love to come here for their pastas! The crispy squid is so delicious and their signature prawn linguine is a must have! I must say their service has improved a lot for both outlets! Great place for a family gathering too! Price wise and portion is good! Reservations may be hard but it all depends on your luck as they can be very busy
3
Place was packed, probably the lunchtime crowd from the offices in Orchard Road. Food - no big deal. The minestrone was above average. The house speciality garlic bread was so-so, but pillowy-soft does not make good garlic bread. As for the chicken club sandwich (part of the 2-course set lunch) - bad! Chicken with the skin still on, underdone and way too oily....
3
Service was excellent. The hostess was very polite and helpful. She even makes and effort to pop by evey now and then to check on us even though we are at the very corner of the restaurant. However, food was normal. We both ordered the pastas as they were freshly made in house. That was the only bonus. I had the crab pasta and I felt that it had no depth and was too salty. The portions were generous though. We also had gelato, which was awesome, and a tiramisu for dessert. I find the rum overpowering and it didn't taste moist fresh, if you get what I mean. It tasted slightly hard like it was sitting in the fridge for some time.
5
We intended to come here for lunch anyway, but the pouring rain made the place suddenly very popular! Staff were brilliant, though we had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table to clear. Then we were offered a really noisy table, sitting underneath people's feet, who were talking loudly at the bar. Bit too claustrophobic but again the staff shone, and quickly cleared a lovely quiet table, and set it up for the four of us.Food didn't quite arrive all at the same time, but forgiven for its deliciousness.Kids menu was proper food rather than rubbish, and portions were well sized.Adult drinks portions were very generous.Left full, and content, with happy kids
2
Ok we are at the Hilton next door and see all this fresh made pasta. We decide to try and it had no taste to it. The salad was so small it was not worth the money. Definite do not go to this place. Service was bad as they never checked with us after they served the food. My wife and I received our meals at different times
4
When we arrived it seemed busy and we were told it would take approx 30 mins for a table. No problem, there's a seating area for a pre-dinner drink. After about 15 mins our table was ready already and a friendly waiter took our order. The restaurant has a great ambiance and is well designed. The food was a mixed bag. The pizza margherita was very good (thin-crust of course) and also the grilled vegetables platter matched expectations. The penne carbonara however was quite bland with not enough parmesan cheese and seasoning. I was surprised they used (this much) cream here as it didnt help. The baked mushrooms were recommended by our waiter but was bland unfortunately as well. We would come back but we'll try a few different dishes. 3.5 sta
5
Spent a lovely evening out with my friends at Jamie's Italian @ Forum. The crab and seafood pasta were great, as were the pork chop and steak. We also shared the fried calamari, carrot salad, mushrooms and slaw. Wrapped dinner up with the molten lava cake, lemon meringue cheesecake and tiramisu. All of us enjoyed the food and I'm pretty sure we'll be back again soon!Highly recommend that you book ahead of time as it was super crowded even in the middle of the week
2
It is somewhat strange.They seemed to try but the result was not quite satisfactory.The food was tasteless and weird.The staff tried to be nice but failed to deliver necessary service.In other words I am disappointed and wont visit again and wont recommend
5
Loved loved the pasta! We tried the penne arrabiata and the one with shrimps both were one of the best we've ever had. The pizza was pretty average though.
3
Service was very poor - rushed AND they kept forgetting things. Salads were tiny for the price; whereas the pastas were huge. That said, the children's menu is excellent.
5
nice fish stew bursting with flavours, particularly liked the barley grains that went into it too. Great sidecar cocktail, the orange liqueur really gave it a nice kick.
5
Good food...fantastic service...great ambience...thank you....happy with the experience and will return and recommend
4
Service crew was excellent! Prompt and attentive... will patronize the restaurant again. Thank you!!
1
I was really looking forward to have dinner there!
Hope the food was as good as Jamie's recipes!
Was noisy, service was Long... Brought around dish twice and food was better at home. Expensive and Loud place.
4
Had a lovely land and sea risotto and delicious fried squid.. burger was not well seasoned and lackluster though. Spent $100 for dinner 2 mains and a starter and 2 drinks.
3
I recently had dinner at Jamie's Italian Forum with a friend from work. The service was outstanding, everyone was super helpful, friendly and prompt. The decor and atmosphere is a bit confusing but ultimately comfortable although I noticed some seats that I was glad I was not sitting in (there are about 10 different kinds which is weird).The food was average chain Italian. I enjoyed the pasta but the garlic bread starter was dinner roles with garlic on top, very bizarre. If the food stepped up a bit, that and the service would up the rating of this place. Chains can do good consistent food, this seemed more like an afterthought
4
The second Green Apple juice we ordered for my son was not green apple juice. We were told the apples came from red apples that time but the color was yellow and the drink was spicy. We returned it asking for no charge. All in all, the food was great. My Super Food Salad was great! The pizzas were good too.
5
I visited this restaurant with my 2 daughters who love Italian food. We all had different choices from the menu and all were excellent. It was extremely busy and the atmosphere with everyone chatting and laughing was wonderful. We were lucky to get the last vacant table as we hadn't booked and was amazed how quickly our meals arrived when you consider how busy it was. Staff were excellent all very helpful and friendly and looked like they really enjoyed their jobs. Brilliant night out thankyou
5
Very kids friendly and affordable yummy food. The ingredients were fresh and even pizza was made on the spot!
4
Went for birthday dinner for my son. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the food. Nice Italian fare. The tiramisu is nice. Friendly staff.
5
Visited Jamie's italian for the first time. It was crowded and had to wait a bit. But it was worth the wait. Food was great, staff was friendly and child-friendly restaurant. Pricing was not over the top. We ordered the crab meat spaghetti, pizza from the specials of the day and a kids meal (spaghetti meatballs, orange juice and salad for $9.50). Would definitely go back
4
Conveniently we hopped into this restaurant for lunch as it was just beside my hotel. We were four and we were lucky to get our table without waiting. Menu offers variety of selection but there is also the "lunch package" for the day written on the board. Food is excellent. I tried their garlic bread, crab spaghetti and cappuccino which were all good. Service is fast and friendly. I'll see myself again in this restaurant in my next visit
1
I am Italian and I live in Asia since years so I know what I am talking aboutActually I never trusted in big brands such as Mozza or Il Lido, especially in Spore, but I hoped this place could have some unexpected surprise but they even are not able to do that...Totally delusion, tasteless, ridiculous use of Italian plate's names, no idea of flavour and Italian hospitality. Please closed it
4
I have been here many times and every time I am satisfied with the food, service is decent and the place itself is quite pleasing. I would just say that it is a little too pricey for what it is and there are places with better food with more reasonable prices all around Singapore. Despite that the food is quite good so I will definitely suggest this place to a friend
5
Had a wonderful time celebrating my daughter's birthday here. I was wondering how this place will compare to the one at Vivocity. In my opinion, it's way better; as compared to my two previous visits to Jamie's at Vivocity.We had pastas, pizza and fish stew which we enjoyed. There was a pasta that one of us found unusual, but which I found refreshing.When it came time to bring out the birthday cake we brought, the staff laid it out nicely on a board, spelling out the words Happy Birthday in chocolate, I think, and then singing the birthday song for my princess. This seemed like the place to celebrate birthdays as we heard the birthday song throughout the evening.I mustn't forget to thank the very attentive server at our table. Though she was busy throughout the evening, she brought water when the bottle was empty, a fresh napkin when mine fell on the floor, much needed plates without us even asking. Didn't get her name but she deserved any accolade that the restaurant can give. Thank you!I will be back
4
I recently went to Jamie's and the food was fantastic but the service was not great. I walked in and had to wait quite awhile at the door which is fair enough as it is a busy place. I was by myself and was seated and promptly ignored for at least 10 minutes. No one came by to take my order or provide water or anything. I did have one served try to deliver another table's order to me by mistake. I finally had someone breeze by my table and take my order and I never saw him again. It took another 10 minutes to get my drink or water. The table next to me had been sitting there during the 10 minutes since my order was taken and couldn't get menus as they were being ignored as well. Once the food came, I really had forgotten about the service as the Truffle Risotto, on special, was absolutely glorious. Rich creamy risotto with bold flavours. I highly recommend it for those risotto lovers out there. It was full of flavour and exactly why I went to the restaurant. Then it came time to pay which was another challenge as they dropped off the bill and before I could give them payment they were off and back to ignoring me. I finally was able to flag someone down to pay. If you want to go for the atmosphere and food, just be prepared to put up with poor service to do so

We, as grand parents decided to take our two grand children out for dinner, whilst their mum and dad had a night off in Singapore! We love Jamie and his inspirational tv programs, so we were keen to take the kids here. Although my Parpadelle Bolognese was just beautiful the same can't be said about the kids spaghetti and meatballs. The attention given to the kids is lovely, once we were seated they were given a gorgeous activiy pouch with pencils, activity book, and the kids menu, which they can color in on the other side. Their meal was inedible! The meatballs were hard and unineresting and the pasta tasted a bit like soap, needless to say they ended up sharing grandma's pasta. We enjoyed a nice glass of their house red, the ambiance is pleasant, surrounded by Jamie Oliver products and the fresh pasta made for the day! The restaurant makes their own pasta every day, which is great

Although there are some negative reviews about this restaurant, I decided to go try it with my wife. Yes, if you are a traditional Italian food fans, this restaurant may somehow disappointed you. As the restaurant named, food served here is with Jamie's twist. A good twist. We ordered sausage pizza, red snapper and tiramisu. All are good, thumbs up. Waiting staff here is professional, understand their products and made good recommendation to us. Will definitely go to try their meat dishes next time
4
The pork chop was so good that we wanted to add and add. Salad and pizza were also good. We love the pasta too. They are not the best food but worth of eating :) plus the staffs there were friendly and helpful
4
The service was very good and food delicious . The waiter went out of of the way to suggest dishes to our liking
3
dissapointing having watched Jamie's cuisine and shows so often!was expecting much tastier food and cuisine!all in all I would rate it as a very everage italian restaurant in Singapore!
4
Overall a solid experience somewhat offset by the hurried way we were dealt with on paying. No issue with having our credit card processed where we ate, but the card and receipt was just left on the table and the server was gone to another table without any acknowledgement. Given the bill arrives in a dinky mini folder selling more Jamie goodies it felt that as we hadn't bought a t shirt or offered a tip above the service charge, the place had no more interest in us. No one spoke to us as we left which was a very downbeat way to end what had been an enjoyable meal
3
The restaurant looks really nice with the overall setting and atmosphere. But we found the food to be just ordinary. The taste is not bad but it's really nothing special. I guess i was expecting more with the name Jamie Oliver. Service is good and attentive
4
We went to Jamies restaurant on our first night in Singapore as it was across the road from our hotel. It was a very popular venue for locals and tourists. The restaurant interior is exactly the same as the one in Birmingham but with more light. We had a very nice meal, nothing spectacular. The staff were very pleasant and extremely hard working. 
4
The pasta is delicious - genuine homemade traditional fresh pasta. Flavours were good. We tried the fresh bread and crispy calamari to start, and the Tagliatelle Bolognese and Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli. The pasta dishes were rich - but not over the top. To finish the meal I felt like a good Italian coffee - but it was very disappointing. The latte tasted like it had come from an automatic machine and was far too milky. There was an espresso machine, but just be careful what coffee you order. Service was good, and good atmosphere in the restaurant
4
We came to Jamies on two occasions during our trip to Singapore. They have good knowledge of gluten free and have gluten free pasta. This was a relief as not many places in Singapore understood about food allergies. Food is nice however like rest of Singapore prices are high, especially with the 17% tax on top. We paid significantly more than what we pay in Perth for the same thing
4
We enjoyed our visit to Jamie's Italian. Great atmosphere and pretty good food. The pasta was very tasty (although a little too salty for my tastes). The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars was the panna cotta which was very disappointing. However, my partner's pavlova was amazing
4
Visited the restaurant at Forum. Really like to try the food of this famous TV chef. Jamie dud not disappointed us. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We felt freshness, healthy and friendly service. And the price is as friensly as the staff. We were amazed with the whole fresh red snapper which was priced at $35. This is a great place! I promised to bring my overseas friends when they come to this part of the world!
4
Food great -very fresh & tasty! Reasonable pricing.Very popular so make sure u book.Pizza - freshly made pastry & fresh ingredients make for a tasty meal.Pasta is also delicious
2
It's not an Italian restaurant: no Italian staff, menu with no Italian dishes but only imitation. Price high.
2
Food was bland but service was good. We all had the pasta which was dry, as Manu Feildil would say "where is the sauce????"
3
Olives were delicious. Lamb was tasty but very fatty. They did not have a decanter for our wine despite it costing $160. Staff very friendly and atmosphere nice. Our total bill for 2 was over $300 which we think does not represent good value at all.
3
Overpriced menu and very mediocre dishes. There are so many better Italian restaurants, I'm afraid Jamie is only trading on his name. The Waiter tried to justify why the food was so bland but I'm afraid at those prices you HAVE to come up with something impressive. Frankly there's more flavour in food court dinin
2
Thought the service was poor and the meals un inspiring. The pasta Bolognese was way over cooked. The caneloni seemed pre frozen and microwaved. The salad side dish was plain and boring. Not a place to repeat.
3
Decided to try as had heard a lot about Jamie Oliver's restaurants...all I can say was I won't be back as it was nothing to get over excited about. Was quite a limited menu, my Husband had the special which was a burger (chips were extra cost) which he said was nothing special, I had seafood pasta (plenty of prawns but missing something), kids had children's meals - "picnic box" had too much food in it - a full apple, grapes, veggie crisps, mini tomatoes AND 2 chicken wraps so much was wasted. Kids spaghetti & meatballs looked OK but were dry & a bit tasteless.All in all SIN $106 (£53 which included service charge) not well spent
1
The service sucks big time. The food is good though (for the price) but the service kills the experience. Definitely not going again
4
Staying at the Orchard Hotel it was handy to go to Jamie's Italian for lunch before our pick up for our flight south. We both had pizza and enjoyed very much the place was buzzing being Sunday lunchtime a great end to our stay in Singapor
1
Overpriced. Average-at-best casual food, very noisy and crowded ambiance with TERRIBLE SERVICE. Not recommended. Ordered a variety of items from crispy squid, a couple of pastas, etc and none of them were anything to rave about (imagine ordering a dish from TGI Fridays or Chilis give it your rating and reduce it by about 20%...thats how the food quality was like here)To make matters worse, Our waiter was rushing us, inattentive and rude throughout the evening.I am a fan of Jamie Oliver's TV shows and his recipes there seem very delicious. Unfortunatley, this place falls way short of that.Spend your money elswehere and avoid this place at all costs
4
It was really great service! All the food we ordered, however, was too salty. The waitress did offered to change the penne carbonara and second round it was much better.
4
The food choices is wide. Salad, mains are good. Desserts are mouth watering and the service is good.
5
Good taste at all selected meals and the casual sitting environment is wonderful together with very nice waiters.
1
Service a disasterStarters were the smallest portions you can ever imagine with no plates and no staff willing to come and supply.Main meals were ok, but nothing to shout about, don't have the pizza it is very dry with little topping and covered in rocket to hide the fact of no topping Not recommende
5
Birthday celebration for my friend. Restaurant located at a very convenient location. All the food are simply delicious. Special thanks to Ms Joy who being so helpful and provide excellent customer service! Will be back for sure and highly recommend this place !
5
It's a weird, casual ambience with odd pop-almost-club music playing, but the food is great! I had "Italian Nachos" (fried cheese ravioli) to start, followed by "Honeycomb Cannelloni Three Ways" (Aubergine & sun-dried tomato, pumpkin, ricotta & spinach) and some gelato with a bit of grappa. It was great! A bit pricy, yes, but this is Singapore
4
As a Global brand Jamie Oliver is amazing. And yeah it's probably his name that made us go to this restaurant. However as a stand alone place it was pretty good. Service was friendly. They are really kid friendly with a cool way for kids to decide how to order (total retro flashback). The quality of the ingredients are excellent and the choices varied. It's definitely a family type of restaurant. But it's not resting on a brand. It's definitely worth a try.
1
The worst server I've ever seen.She started with introducing special menu but, I had to ask about that few more times and just gave up asking again. she just said spinach and cheese blah blah blah. She doesn't said that was ravioli. She threw everything like lucky-draw and bill and went back somewhere whenever I asked that. The table by my side had to wait too long and annoyed for ordering the dessert because of the server's chatting. I can't understand how this restaurant get the 10% service charge. My table was 3001 Hazel Something. The dishes were good
4
A group of us went for late dinner. Had rump steak, pasta, lamb chops, drinks and dessert. The food was tasty and nice but nothing extraordinary for the name is carries. Guess u r paying for the name more than the food. Nice ambience. A mix of Caucasian and local crowd. Enjoyed it.
4
We got 2 pizza - a Italien hot and a funghi. Both of them were well prepared with a good taste of the ingredience. About the concept itselves we do now - it is a "messy" place with all the stuff they display!!However food was nice
5
We visited twice and had excellent meals during both visits. Very child friendly too. Reasonably priced considering the food selection and quality.
5
1st visit to Jamie's Italian kitchen. Very Knowledgeable & friendly service staff. Ultimate garlic bread, spicy squid ink pasta & fantastic oven baked crispy pork & salads. Definitely will be back again. Kudos to the Forum team!
5
The food are so great delicious. We love the pizza, squid ink spaghetti and deep fried calamari. Thanks Jamie for bringing the best food to Singapore. We really enjoy our afternoon here.
4
While wandering Orchard Road, we stopped in for the pizza special for the day. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The pizza was great. Nice attention to detail in the decorating of this restaurant.
4
It's actually our 3rd. Food is great and healthy that's why we keep on coming back. Our friend from US is health conscious that's why I thought it's best to bring her to Jamie's. She liked the salad with Salmon a lot.
4
Very good Margherita, you can see the tossed crust preparation from your table. Dropped in for a late night snack; pizza with their house Italian red, a Nico Monnte which was good. A rustic style venue, friendly and helpful staff. Easy to find next to the Hilton on Orchard Road
4
If you are expecting a fancy restaurant this is not it but lives up to expectation of eating in a bustling kitchen. The food is good and the service keeps things moving. Probably not to all tastes a limit menu but great presentation and taste. If you are looking for a quick meal with good food this is the place
4
It is a quite ok place to eat. Simple food, small menue, but therefore fresh ingredients and quick service. Nice decor, and not the typical Italian cuisine, but indeed nicely presented and with an added twist.Good service. For Singapore, price is ok. No need to order the expenses wine or beer, food tastes absolutely fine with water.Good location also, next to the Hilton hotel
3
The restaurant is larger than it looks from the outside, which permits to go for dinner without having made reservations.As I did not have a lot of time, I decided to go for the rump steak, with garlic and parsley butter, rainbow coleslaw and French fries.The food was OK, bur for the quantity and quality, the price is a little high: +50 SGD for a steak and a bottle of sparkling water
2
Too salty! We didn't even remember to brought it up to the chef! That's because the last couple of times we tried eating at vivocity branch, it was pretty good, this branch is nearer and we havent tried before and this time I'm here to celebrate birthday with my loved one.We ordered their special, spicy seafood spaghetti, mushroom risotto and garden salad with full of rockets. Spicy seafood and risotto are too salty! First bite of them are fine, risotto smells good with truffle oil. Spaghetti it tastes like chili crab but worse.Regretted to order their this "special dish". Salad...... Taste a bunch of salt and too much of balsamic vinegar either one of them are too much! Last thing, they served lava chocolate cake for my birthday, the ice cream was melted half way... Chocolate in the lava is way way way too sweet that can swamp you with glucose. Besides the dishes... We asked to sit inside where nearer to the kitchen thought it will be quieter. Servers practice that before every dish being served, that will be a senior chef to do quality check on the dishes. Whether the temperature of beef is right, properly cooked with what customers requested. The senior chef with glasses sounds so loud and bossy to order around and sounded everyone inside the kitchen. Dramatic all time. Cantonese, mandarin, English he spoken to the staffs. It makes the environment more like a Chinese food stalls else where.We managed to talk to a staff before we leave, he asked why didn't we mention about the food, we should have let them know, they will serve us a new one. But it didn't really came across our mind maybe we were too happy that day and not in a complaint mood.......... We regretted I promise! Anyway, the guy told us, Vivocity big chef is an Italian, Forum branch is a local Chinese chef. Waiters, waitresses did their job well after all. I hope there are someone there would be able to read this and take it as a reference for improvements. Hopefully more and more good reviews and good word of mouth for this branch. Till next time
1
Well Italian food it's much different from what they serve here.
Another place where Italian food is missrapresented.
3
The service provided by a Sarawakian waiter is phenomenon.
However, not from the others.
The food was just moderate; nothing to shout about.
5
It's was a suprise b day celebration for my best friend. Both of us loved the food to the last bite. The service of good. The staff there suprised us with a b day cake. Tks guys Just one thing, the place was overwhelmed with customers. Wish we had a better siting place. We will surely visit Jamie's Italian Forum again
4
It was our first visit to the restaurant, I would like to compliement on one of the waiter - Shaun (from china) , he always Carry a nice smiley face and he is efficient in his service , he made our visit a pleasant one .
2
I took a couple friends from out of town who wanted italian and thought Jamie's would be a decent place. My first experience was over at Vivo city which wasn't great if i recalled and thought i'll give it a shot here. Unfortunately, not that great here either. Had 3 antipasti, entrees and 3 cocktails. The carrot and avacado salad was absolutely pathetic. i even had to cut up a lettuce to share with a friend. Portions were laughably small. The italian pate bruschetta was decent. Baked mushrooms wins for best antipasti category. Nice presentation and great tasting as well. Both the octopus and mussel spaghetti and grilled pork chop were too salty. The service was rather lacking but maybe they were really busy. I do hope they get better soon.
5
Love the pizzas, the cauliflower appetiser, my pasta was fantastic and the seafood soup was Great! One of my kids favourite eateries in Singapore...
5
Would it rate a Michelin Star. NOAre the staff smiling, moving with a spring in their step, interacting with customers and each other in a good way. YESIs the food prepared in a precise way with everything cut to exactly the same size and lined up like a battalion of the Coldstream Guards. NOIs the food prepared in a way that makes it attractive and tasty. YESIs Jamies a good dining experience. NO its a bloody great dining experience
4
Found this on Orchard Rd about lunchtime so took a look at the menu which was enough to tempt me in. The staff were soon to greet me and I was seated and a drink order taken. Looking round I'd describe it as rustic old kitchen charm. I ordered the daily pasta special followed by lemon cheesecake and dbl espresso. Including the diet coke the service and local tax came in at what I thought was a respectable S$58.85. Service was excellent, efficient but not hurried and I liked the lunchtime atmosphere. Would I eat here again? Yes and I'd be tempted to try other locations
3
What can i say -- it does feel like an upscale "TGIFridays". I'm not saying it's bad or good, but it is what it is. Although the selection of food IS NOT like Fridays, I had expected a slightly wider range of menu. Food was ... at level of Fridays??!!Anyway, my pros: I sat near the kitchen -- i could see the chef cooking (and grunting and the head chef slightly yelling) -- feel like's tiny hell's kitchen, eh. Another pro was the Funghi Pizza was fab (and was recommended by the waitress).. Thanks. Would l come here again (as a tourist)??... ermm.... i'd say, "been there, done that"
2
I am sorry to say this, but i am a huge fan of Jamie and always watch his cooking on TV.. So i guess my expectations was a bit high when we entered.. It was like a daycarecenter, full of kids, noisy, stressed staff squeezed us into a corner with a kitchendoor swinging in our faces. The waiter could hardly hear us when we tryed to figure out which wine to choose.. After a few minutes we looked at eachother and decided to leave.. Sorry Jami
5
Pleasant and Trendy Restaurant for people of all walks of life be it business or meeting friends and family outings.
Very pleasant staff as always!
3
Its a typical mid range JO restaurant. The food was really good but the music was too loud ! Service was ok and the price was mid range. Nothing too exciting and didn't get ill so gets a thumbs up !!
5
We had lunch at this lovely spot. I had the superfood salad with smoked salmon and my husband had the Bolognese. I loved my salad- and our shared dessert of the brownie was awesome. It's the first time I've tasted a brownie that has been cooked to gooey perfection.
5
Jamie's was a solid and enjoyable dining experience. The dishes were coming out in time and the taste was very, very good! Italian nacho's were to die for! All the ingredients were fresh, and meals were prepared very well. The service was accommodating and polite. The décor is very inviting and warm
4
Great meal at Jamie's Italian. We had the garlic flatbread and ricotta bruschetta to start. Both were tasty. My husband had the turbo penne arrabbiata that he said was tasty, it had a lot of chilli - the waiter warned him when he ordered. I had the margherita pizza which was delicious. Base was lovely and crispy and the tomato sauce was fantastic. The tiramisu was also lovely. The restaurant has a great atmosphere and was quite busy the night we dined. Only issue is that some of the tables are very close together. Well worth a visit if you enjoy Italian
5
Walking down orchard rd we came upon Jamie's Italian, didn't know there was one there. We decided to go there for dinner. I had the lasagna, which looked a little flat, being Italian myself I'm used to lasagnes looking fat and high. But it was really delicious, almost as good as my nonna's! Hubby has the mushroom pizza, the pizza base has a wonderful taste and texture. We also has a welcome to singapore city map, which has a Jamie's Italian offer on it, so we got a free dessert with each main we ordered (great deal). Wait staff were very attentive and friendly. Will definitely go back again
2
Service good, atmosphere bustling, food average. Ordered a dish that was described as octopus and got squid rings. Salad of heirloom carrots that were cooked to a mush. Food over seasond ie very salty. Thank goodness for the wine - oh, that's not made by the restaurant. Might be Italian by name but not like nona cooks!
4
The name Jamie Oliver meant nothing to me, but we were strolling down a Orchard Road when my wife said "look, Jamie Oliver has a restaurant here." I asked where she knew Jamie from and she said the Food Channel. Since it was about six blocks from our hotel, we decided to have our Singapore farewell dinner here. It was a Friday night and we didn't have any reservations, but they seated us in less than the 30 minutes they said the wait would be. Our server was friendly and prompt. I had an excellent pasta dish (see photo) and my wife had a type of Cioppino , although they called it something else. The deserts were excellent. Our bill for two including a glass of wine was $93 USD. If you're in the mood for Italian food, you be better off coming here than the CPK down the street.
5
I was in Singapore about a week ago, stayed at the Orchard Parade Hotel. Walked down the Street a bit and came upon Jamie's Italian Forum. It was lunch time the Restaurant was full but the nice Lady at the door squeezed me in up at the Bar situated up one end of the Kitchen. It was worth it - Great Food, Great Beer and good company with the other people squeezed in at the same end of the bar. The Kitchen is open and it was good to see all the Chefs performing like Jamie. I recommend this venue but would strongly recommend you pre book. Cheers, Gary 
2
I have been to the Jamie's Italian at Vivo City for number of times because of their great service and amazing foods that served. Therefore I wanted to try and dine in at the Forum at orchard road, as they are newly opened. Yet, it was a disappointment. I dine in to celebrate Valentine's Day with my girlfriend and I ordered my all time favourite: rump steak. Well, that was not the same as what I usually order in the Jamie's Italian at Vivo City. The taste is different and the sauce tasted weird. Fries were over-cooked and hard to bite. That was the 1st time i never finished eating my fries which were served with the rump steak. Wishing that the food quality will be improved as this is a great restaurant.
4
Good food, romantic ambience and attentive staff. Went to celebrate my anniversary. The staff are knowledgeable and know the menu well.
5
Liked the burger, linguine prawn pasta was ok. Good lively atmosphere but service is a little slow during peak hours, understandably
5
The dinner is awesome wanted to come back again nice place good service.will come.back with my darling bf.
4
good place thou a little pricey and portion pretty small. Will be a nice place for people who have very small diegestive system.
3
Firstly the tables in our section were a little too close together.We had no choice but to listen to the conversation at the table next to us.The service is good and friendly.However, after serving our pre-dinner drinks there was no follow-up for wine or other drinks during the meal.The entres were ok but the main courses definitely disappointing. My lamb chops were just slightly over-cooked and pretty tasteless. Deserts were uninspiring.Disappointing given the brand name and the price
1
I don't usually complain about service, but this time I really feel the need to let truth escape my lips about our dining experience here: The food was just right but nothing phenomenal as the pretentious name and a weighty price had to offer. However, I must say I can really vouch for the tenacity of the kitchen team behind my seat! (They were amenable and immediately changed my Italian Burger when the patty came just tad too dry and went back rechecked whether the latter already suited to my preferred doneness). It was actually the service that distorted the whole experience, unfortunately! Unlike at the other Jamie's chains, some of waitstaffs here seriously need to improve their manners and learn about quality & courteous service by all means! And on the top of that, there was neither proper greetings nor a farewell thank you coming out from that snooty host guy! Which was akin to any fast food joint experience, only better without such predicament as we would readily manage our expectation.Well, just incase they forget what is so pivotal expected from such a pretentious name here: Even the best food can never make up for a bad service! Sorry Jamie, as much as you're one of my fave chefs, we're unlikely returning
4
We ate here 2 consecutive nights while we were here en route to Australia. We had previously visited Jamie's Italian in Bath, U.K. and had been somewhat disappointed, finding it far too busy to cope with the orders properly. This time we found the pasta dishes reasonable and the pork chop well cooked if not particularly to my taste with its Asian flavourings. However the vanilla pannacotta with the fruit compote was one of the best desserts I have ever had and made the second visit compulsory! I would certainly return if I were in that area again
2
They pizza... Looked messy like Jamie would make it maybe but the tomato sauce and the crust... Blunt. Average. Disappointing. Expensive is another word that comes to mind. Service water is free or the costs will explode. Kind of my own mistake to believe what the TV sold me. Staff was nice and attentive. No risk of me returning or recommending.
2
We eat there as we were passing and it seemed very convenient. The reception was good and helpful and we were told the wait would be 10-15 minutes. As promised we were seated within that time frame. We both ordered the pan fried red snapper. Bad decision. We thought it was tasteless and left half on the plate. Management were concerned and offered sweets on the house
5
Awesome service, great atmosphere and well priced menu. This was our second visit and will definitely be back for more :
5
We had dinner with our 20 months old on 5 Feb. The restaurant staff are friendly and the kids pack of the restaurant kept my baby entertained and let my husband and I had a enjoyable dinner.
1
Very poor no gold card facility available unfortunately not up to Jamie's standard
Sorry Jamie
Not returning
5
Had some really tasty nachos to start followed by an Italian hot pizza, I've eaten pizza in Italy and I can easily say that this one was one of the best I've had. Service was efficient and friendly, but as most eateries in Singapore, expensive.
4
Decor was reasonable and down to earth.
Friendly serving staff who provided best-in-class service.
I ordered the steak which was very good.
Overall, a good place to stop for a meal.
1
The 6 of us were rushed to order 5 minutes after being seated. Food was delivered and placed at the end of the table for us to distribute. Portions were a tad small. Utensils placed directly on the table. My wife asked for a plate and the waitress wiped one off with the palm of her hand and passed it to her. Bus boy dropped a plate beside our table, en route to the back and ignored the sauce that splattered on my sister in law. No one offered pepper for the pasta and the nearby tables were amused when my brother in law tossed the napkin over his shoulder and offered everyone. The bill came seconds after we asked which further solidified that this machine exists only to turn over tables... Not impressed at all
3
We have eaten at quite a few of "Jamie's" restaurants around the world and found the same great standard at each one. However this restaurant did not meet our expectations. The service was slow, the food quite expensive and the atmosphere almost "fast food joint". Very disappointing
4
Dropped in for lunch. Waiters courteous, Manager also made us very welcome and informative. She told us the pasta is made on site and introduced us to the chef. Delicious pizza as well. Daughter, keen on souvenirs, bought tea towels. I think this was a good value plac

I reserved a table two days in advance for what I thought might be a nice Chinese new Year early evening meal with typical Jamie Oliver cuisine and a friendly, personal service that we have come to expect of high end named restaurants in Singapore.Instead, when arriving at the Restaurant I was greeted with a request to join a long line of other prospective diners to await a table - they were presumably off the street and had not reserved.Sorry Jamie, if I take the trouble to reserve a table for 7pm and am told online that it will only be held for 15 minutes, I expect to have a table available and not to have to queue up with random off the street diners. I cancelled the reservation on the spot and walked out.I am a great fan of Jamie Oliver's creativity and style but my experience of the Orchard Road restaurant was akin to a 1980's motorway service station.....but not quite as nice.Sort it mate ...or just don't take reservations otherwise you are bound to disappoint big time with the current set up. I hope to eventually eat at your restaurant but it looks unlikely unless you upgrade from what was effectively a McDonalds...you can do better than that and most of the people in the restaurant probably don't know who you are anyway...it was just another place to eat for them.Branding ...it's good when it works ..... but it can bite you in the rear when it doesn't ! Colin Robinson

The food of this Italian restaurant is no better than my homemade one. Indeed is very disappointed. I ordered their most famous prawn spaghetti. The prawns are frozen one got not seafood taste at all. My friend ordered a 30 days aged steak and it was cold with no beef taste. Really a disappointed dinner. The ice lemonade is warm. The service is not good. I feel like not welcome for there. The reception guy seeing we go inside, he continued to cleaning the used table but not welcome and assign table for us. Upon we stood for a while he came forth direct seats. With no consideration he just assigned a small table next to the entrance while many better table inside the restaurant. Disappointed !!! The most disappointed dinner in Singapore so far
4
I booked the lunch online we arrived early and were seated on time. The restaurant has very good service despite the restaurant being busy. The food was good. It was all served hot and fresh. The restaurant has a great buzz and servers are there without having to look for them. Well done Jamie Oliver
3
Friends had commented to skip the crab, I can confirm to also skip the prawn pasta dish. Prawns were tiny, pale and zero Favour watery -maybe frozen or canned type prawns. Expect at this price point and status to be fresh well cooked seafood. Ambience and staff were very nice. Other dishes and wood planks were nice.
3
Menus is OK - food was fine but the decor was not so great -still if you looking for a restaurant to feed the kids and your staying next door at the Hilton then this is ideal. I generally like Jaime Oliver properties and will travel to one, but I cant say the same for this property.
3
Nothing too extraordinary as what i have expected. Too pricely for what it is. No free bread like in Europe. You need to pay for every single thing..
3
Ok there is pizza and pasta but it is all a bit bish bash bosh as Jamie might say.The menu reads like a corporate version of Jamie with silly adjectives thrown in to make dishes sound better than they are.We had the special which was served unseasoned with hardly any of the"rollickin" advertised sauce.A one course lunch for two with coffee and beers was over150 sing dollars which in the words of the cheeky chappy himself felt like daylight robbery mate.Avoid
3
Loved the big signage as that attracts attention. The waiting area is small but very cosy, loved that too! There's 3 of us and decided to walk-in around 745pm on a wet Friday night but was told to come back in half hour and a text message was sent out earlier that table was ready. No plans to dine here but my Wife and Son thought since I've not. My wife and I decided to have just snacks, crispy squid, skinny fries and crab arancini while my Son went for the rigatoni pomodoro with burrata. My son's pasta was fantastic! The bread crumb sprinkle was generous, the fresh basil and melted burrata could do a bit more though. My crab arancini was dry on the side, the crispy squid batter was on the salty side and skinny fries were fries. Presentation is good!Maybe it's the culture but don't you suppose to wait everyone is finished to clear the table as I thought it's a signal to say, "I need the table fast so buzzed off!"Not sure if I'll return again.
5
The food was great and the staff were very accommodating with food allergies, the atmosphere was full of family groups and singles, overall a good evenin
2
My last visit was in Jamie's Italian in London and it was great. I expected to be the same in Singapore, but it was not. My colslo salad tasted like fresh lemon juice, the pizza (margarita)..... The Dominos is a lot better and the tiramisu was full of orange particles and a was not able to taste the coffee and mascarpone. And finally the location, it is in the main road, but actually you see only inside one of the ugliest malls i have ever been to. Great staff by the way
1
Food disgraceful.Service poor.My wife and I booked online on a Saturday for the Sunday evening - no problem. We arrived at the alotted time and our table was ready. Once seated, a waiter immediately came to greet us and to offer menus. We ordered drinks, which came quickly.Then it all went downhill.We waited a good ten minutes for the waiter to return so that we could order our food. My wife asked for the Turbo Penne Arrabiata, and I requested the Tagliatelle Bolognese. As the waiter took my wife's order, he said something like "Ooh, I see, pasta" - it was so noisy we couldn't properly hear what he said, which also didn't seem to be meant for us.When our meals arrived, after only about six minutes, we were surprised. Six minutes to prepare two pasta dishes? Not long enough, surely? But there they were, steaming in front of us. So we started: the arrabiata was accompanied by a tablespoon filled with breadcrumbs and a little parmesan. Really? Skimping on the parmesan and saving money by stretching it with breadcrumbs? It turns out the bywords for the penne arrabiatta dish are "turbo" and "chili". My wife's not afraid of spicy food but she just could not eat the dish given her. Being a gentleman, I offered to swap dishes with her so I ate the volcanic mess (and it was a mess) she'd been served. I too don't mind spicy food (my tolerance is way higher than my wife's - I'd been eating Vindaloo a couple of days earlier, for example), but even I found the dish hot. It was more a kind of challenge than a meal. The parmesan was tasteless, and the breadcrumbs congealed into a soggy mass by soaking up all the grease around the outside of the dish (olive oil? Who knows: nobody gets to see the dish being prepared). I guess our waiter had actually said "ooh, spicy pasta" when he took our order.So my wife made do with the tagliatelle bolognese: also not impressed. What happened to the tomatoes? Every bolognese recipe I've ever read or tasted includes tomatoes, but no evidence of them in this dish. And Jamie Oliver's own recipe includes tomatoes! The mix of meats (pork and beef) was correct, but tasteless, and there was the smallest sprinkle of parmesan, already provided on the sauce when the dish was served. That is just wrong!! Is it real parmesan, grated from a block of cheese by the chefs? Or just mass produced parmesan dust from a plastic bag? To be fair, both the penne and the tagliatelle were cooked almost perfectly to al dente resistance. A minor plus point.So, to cool my wife's flaming tongue, we looked to order another drink each. No waiting staff around. For ten minutes. When the meeter and greeter brought new diners to a nearby table, we ordered from him explaining the lack of waiting staff. Another 6 to 8 minutes passed: no drinks. Our original waiter returned, beaming; I instantly asked for the bill and told him to cancel our second drinks. He returned with the bill a couple of minutes later and drifted away - just as our cancelled drinks arrived. We refused them, and paid.All in all, we had one drink each, waited for service for 15 minutes plus, ate our horrible dishes, and left, all in less than an hour. Make no mistake; apart from the dreadful service, this is a fast food restaurant camouflaged as prime dining. One last point: when will restaurants and bars in Singapore start publishing the actual price a customer will pay? I am used to it by now but it still rankles with me that my $28 dollar dish has to have GST added as well as a service charge. Include ALL of the price and publish that!! We don't have any choice about the GST (or usually the service charge either) so why not be honest and point out, up front, that there'll be two additions to the bill?Would I reccomend this place to my friends? NO.Will I return? What do you think? Once bitten twice shy. Jamie Oliver has enough money so he won't miss my return visit - but his reputation can be damaged by the dross being served up here and by the awful service. Not up to standard

Manged to book this restaurant online for the same day for 5 of us for dinner. Food was beautiful, staff very friendly and welcoming. Restaurant is very clean and has a nice ambience. The waiter even let me try the wine before buying. Excellent service. Portions were a great size and we managed to eat everything on our plates without being too full. Would definitely come back here again

Had a late lunch date with old friends. We ordered a reccomended dish ;seafood stew, and from the menu a super food salad and magarita pizza for sharing. The food was quite unique. The pizza was crispy, i liked it that way. Salad was more of grains unlike the usual leafy type which I thought was refreshing. I'm not so much a seafood lover, expected a little more soup and tangy flavour since it was tomato based. The ambience was quite cozy and the waitor was enthusiatic about letting us know the daily speciasl which he described pretty clearly
4
Shortly after landing in Singapore, I wanted a fuss-free dinner and something that was close to my hotel. Speedy service and my meal and drinks were the high class I expect from Jamie's restaurants.
5
A must try "our famous prawn linguine", if u like spicy food, can request to add a little bit more chilli. Thumbs up service. Thank you Sheila for recommending so many food, wine & desserts.
5
We eat here for dinner, is a very nice restaurant, the kids been taken care well by the staff, it is a very good family restaurant. I really recommended it.
4
Food was really fresh and tasty, overall didn't spend as much as expected too. it was a little warm in the restaurant which I didn't like though.
Baked mushrooms and meat platters were my favourite item
4
Good meal, fresh tasting with a good choice of options for our family of four with varied tastes! Enjoyed it right after a Star Wars movie on 3D IMAX at Shaw. Pleasant experience...decent wine choices as well! Cheers
4
I like the atmosphere. We ordered house special of homemade pizza prosautto and octopus & mussel spagehtti. The pizza was ok but bit dry. The spaghetti was a bit salty. Overall we think the food was 3.5
5
A few days before this visit, we were walking along Orchard Road when my wife saw this place and told me that she wanted to try their food. It was just about time for my wife and kids to return back home in Costa Rica and my wife's birthday is coming up at the end of January, therefore I will not be able to celebrate the specific date with her, therefore we decided to celebrate my wife's birthday there and so we went.The place is very well setup, great setup, cozy, a place that invites you for a good italian meal. My wife had the penne carbonara, I had the tagliatelle bolognese with a nice glass of Montepulciano red wine. Portion has a good size, the presentation very good and the taste amazing, last but not least, prices are affordable considering the restaurant's reputation.We finished enjoying a panna cotta and a key lime cheesecake, both delicious.I definitely recommend this place among one of the best italian restaurants here in Singapore, by the way the service was definitely one of the best I've ever had here in Singapore since I've been here for the last 2 years

The front of house was not a good start. Not friendly, and whilst we had to wait for 20 minutes, an offer of a drunk would have been welcome.We were seated and our waiter was equally terse. In the uk, the staff are trained to make the specials sound exciting - this waiter made them sound dull.We started with the bread platter. This looked inviting in the window but when it arrived most of the bread was dry- the tapenade was the saving grace. The main courses were fine - the mushroom risotto would have benefitted from some fresh Parmesan and the pizza a little lacking in topping.The waiter totally lost interest in us at this point and it was a good 20 minutes with finished plates in front of us before we had enough and got the bill at the till.Disappointing and not to the same standard as UK Jamie's.
3
The location is good/accessible.The resto is nice. I like the ambience.We ordered the following:Italian Pate Bruschetta Grilled Porkchop30-day Prime SirloinBaby Beef BurgersSpaghetti & Meatballs Penne CarbonaraTruffle RisottoPrawn LinguineAl Funghi PizzaEpic BrownieGelatoOur verdict:The Truffle Risotto is the best. The sirloin and pizza were good. Overall, it was okay but nothing really special or different
3
We were the first table arrived but we were the last table to be served with food. Ordered grilled veal as dish of the day, tasted of the potato as side was good but it served lukewarm which was disappointing
5
Regular at their Dubai as well as Singapore restaurants. It's not just the main course the Gelato is equally mouth watering
4
I came here with a friend for dinner and was very impressed.Its not fine dining but to me seemed more a fairly fast turnover place.I thought the food was very enjoyable and substantially less than I was expecting it to cost.I also found drinks to be very well priced and the barman did an excellent job of making delicious cocktails.Table staff could be more knowledgeable regarding the menu as they seemed to know very little in this regard and more just bring out the plates and the bill
1
I don't think I've ever been served a worse meal in my life. I order the "signature prawn linguine". A huge pile of spaghetti was in the middle of a bowl floating in a "sauce" that resembled a tin of tomato soup. The prawns also looked like they came from a tin or can as they were colourless, minuscule and completely tasteless. I had to send my meal back it was SO terrible. My friend ordered the cannelloni- the pasta was undercooked and the filling also completely tasteless and resembled a frozen meal that had been poorly microwaved. I could never recommend this place to anyone but perhaps the burgers and fries are better but how "Italian" are they!!!???!But most significantly, I cannot believe Jamie Oliver endorses a place with such disgusting food.
5
We visited on Christmas Eve and it was a very relaxed, festive atmosphere and an easy to get to location. Food menu was varied, very tasty and (for us) had large portion sizes. Staff were very friendly and service was prompt. We would return and recommend
2
I've been to Jamie Oliver's in Bath and Edinburgh which were both good but the food in Forum was well below expectations. The food was much too salty, the pizza crust was too hard which made it tough to cut, the tagliatelle was too al dente until it seemed not cooked well enough. The meal was that unsatisfying that we decided to skip dessert and go elsewhere
4
being Italian, I do not normally like to eat Italian abroad. Last night we needed something in the nearby at an affordable price.We chose Jamie's which has a good offer of pasta and pizza. Spaghetti with seafood were well cooked, as the pizza was light and thin. Garlic everywhere which is not Italian.Anyway good! we will return if around Orchard R
5
Went to try out as not sure if it was good. Shared food with friends so to get a wider selection. Had mussels and octopus pasta, crab risotto balls, Pizza, oven baked sea bass and lots of desert. Conclusion, not the best of the best but the food did not disappoint. Majority of our orders are delicious and the fish is exceptionally fresh, ambience is great and had a blast with friends
5
We loved eating at Jamie's. We enjoyed it so much we went to both his restaurants in Singapore. They have a great casual, fun atmosphere. The staff are terrific and very accommodating. When I made the booking on line, I requested a round table somewhere quiet and they did both. The food was delicious. The pizza was great, veal chop also and I loved my grain salad. Desserts are worth indulging in too. Everyone loved it !
3
My favorite (classic) arancini that Jamie's Italian does so well was replaced by a dry, chewy crab arancini. Boo.And the prawns in the bestselling linguine were so obviously from deep-freeze.Good thing the pizza was fabulous
1
Maybe because Im Italian, but the food was below our expectation, I did not find any italian taste in this restaurant, the spaghetti nero seafood taste no seafood, very far forn nero di seppia italiano.Pizza dough is very hard and very difficult to digest, is more like bread than pizza, the arancini with cipolla and lemon taste not good. People come here only becauae is celebrity chef restaurant. Better eat in other plac
5
Went with my parents, who do not experiment outside of Indian cuisine much. they loved the fare on offer. My wife you loves Italian, was blown away by the risotto. Nice blend of tastes and freshness.
4
Good food, great ambience. The pasta portions match the pricing considering it's a celebrity Chef restaurant. The steak is well cut and tender.
4
I've come here twice now, and have been very pleased both times. I suggest the charcuterie plate with their garlic flatbread as a nice, simple lunch. My wife loves the bolognese, and the spicy Italian pizza is truly chilli laden.
4
Food was amazing! However it was very very packed! So if you don't mind a lot of noise & a lot of people it's okay. Service was good, food was delicious but just a bit too busy.
3
Me and friends and family went here for year end lunch and it was a very nice gathering. The place has its "warm" style for people gather, chats and eat. I ordered refresher a lemon base drink, and baked mushroom. The drink was too sweets and the baked mushroom could be much better. But to me taste is about preference.
2
While the food was just okay (nothing fantastic, really!), the service is really, really terrible.. No manners and they are all confused.. Wrong orders, wrongly sent food all around, not friendly and of course, no "thank you" after you pay.. They just throw the receipt and the mug on your table and let it say thank you, cos you know, it's written "THANK YOU" on the card/receipt, so they don't have to orally say it..Don't order garlic flatbread.. It's like eat your grandma's underwear..Don't order juice.. It's not even drinkable even if it's cordial and not freshly squeezed.. in a tiny cup for that price, that's like daytime and nightime robbery.. Other than that, pork chop is okay.. the pastas and pizzas are really just mediocre... NOTHING FANTASTIC ABOUT THEM ALL!
1
The food and desert are really suck especially the Tiramisu cake, it seem to me the cake has drowned in water. I have never tasted such a cake like this. It was a bad experience when you invited friend for a birthday treat and your friend has been complaining about the quality of the food. You felt so embarrassing and it's my mistake for not reading the review (it was bad) after my friend commented. Though the quality of food are bad but I must say the service was good especially the waiter who serve us. Lesson learnt must read review first before visit, otherwise end up with disappointment....
5
Went to a company Christmas lunch and got very impressed so booked a table for two the following night. Jamie's Italian is not for the faint hearten soul - it is hustle bustle with great efficiency. Service is impeccable, we had hardly sat down and our table attendant came across with his online food ordering pad. We ended up trying three starters and we thoroughly enjoyed the Italian Pate Bruschetta, Crispy Squid and Baked Mushroom. We also asked for the fiery arribiata dip - the latter a must try! For mains we settled on the pink snapper acqua pazza - Hong Kong steamed style with olives, garlic, wine, capers, parsley and baby plum tomatoes - the fish done to perfection. We also ordered 30 day matured prime sirloin - and although not the most tender - but the mushrooms and the rocket salad accompanying the meat made up for it! For dessert we had Lemon Meringue Cheesecake - just to die for - so please leave some room at the end. We were fortunate to get a table facing the open kitchen - with no tables behind us leaning towards the glassed wall. In summary - an excellent place to try various dishes from the starting menu, great ambiance with superb service
4
Online and Booking via phone was very troublesome and no plus point for Jamie's as it took several attempts. However, once we got there to catch up with our friends over dinner it was worth wile. It was very packed and therefore it's strongly recommended to make a booking otherwise it might takes you up to 45 mins waiting time. Our waiter was friendly and knew the menu well. we ordered pasta,pizza,chef's special and dessert. Food was tasty, well seasoned and portion size sufficient the price it's quite on the high end site which will makes it occasionally visits only.Overall a nice experience
4
Great for families! Has much healthier kid menu options than the typical chicken nugget and fries you'll get in most other restaurant kid menus. Also thanks to Shiela and Hazel who was extra attentive, friendly and even surprised us with a nice little cake for our 2 year old's birthday
4
Had a wonderful lunch with son at this new outlet and loved everything!
Surprised by the fairly wide vegetarian selection, which was oh so tasty!
5
Love the foods, especially the prawn linguine. The good thing is they offer food for toddler. Service is great. I would love to come back here again :D
4
Italian at Forum turns out well 😄 the pizza pescatore was amazingly light and flavourful. The cannelloni superb. Calamari crispy and raviolli good crunch. Penne carbonara interestingly great tasting. Only wish the affrogato martini was a bit more creamier and smoother 😉
5
Our first meal after arriving in Singapore and my wife wanted pizza after traveling 33 hours. Didn't think we would get in without reservations Very short wait and had the pizza special. It was very goog perfect to share. Will go back before leaving
3
There were a lot of people here so atmosphere was nice. But it was disappointing. The Pork chops was sgd 40 - there was one slice of meat and that's about it. No finesse at all. Prawn linguine was so-so. Crab ball appetizer was all rice and very little meat. Won't come here again
3
Big fan of Jamie Oliver' cooking shows...restaurant was so so...perhaps I had high expectations, it is just another Italian restaurant owned by non Italian;( Service was good and restaurant decorated lovely. We did reserve the table however they had many empty tables -perhaps because it was a weekday-
2
if you want a good steak go elsewhere. I ordered the prime sirloin to be cooked medium but when it arrived, already sliced, it was between rare and medium rare. Someone in the kitchen should have noticed it was wrong when they sliced it, but they didn't, and of course you can't further cook a steak properly when it is already sliced.... but they did! Apart from the poor cooking, the quality of the steak was not great and certainly there is much better on offer at Hard Rock or Black Angus nearby. My partner ordered the 220gram rump steak, medium / well done which again was undercooked and not great in quality. She chose to eat it rather than send it back, because being a small size and sliced it would become dried up if cooked further. She had virtually finished her meal before my recooked steak returned, which spoilt the occasion.Ordering the Italian bread selection after placing the main order seemed to cause confusion and it was certainly not worth waiting for. We were hoping for warm, fresh bread but it was hard and dry and certainly not worth $8. It also arrived with our starters which defeated the object!As for the starters the crab arancini was flavourless and I would suspect virtually crabless too. The large portion of crispy squid was equally disappointing. To start with it was not a large portion by normal standards and certainly not worth $24. Crispy? Some of the coating was but overall it was soggy and rubbery.Since the earlier courses had been so disappointing we decided to call the bill and go elsewhere for dessert and coffee.Clearly there was very little quality control in the kitchen or maybe standards are set at a low level. Whichever the case, the result was a poor dining experience and very poor value. I would not return or recommend the restaurant
2
We did not have a good meal or service when we at at Jamie's. I had not eaten at a Jamie's restaurant and was really looking forward to trying it out. The attitude by the staff in particular the manager was unfriendly, short and dis interested. The food was quite ordinary. In fact even though we ordered two dishes each, we did not find one that we liked at all. Quite a disappointment. We will not be back.
4
FIrst visit and We like everything we ordered especially the pork chop. It was so tasty. my guests love it. I don't usually like Olive but their Olive on ice was really good!! It does not have that wierd smell. However, it was a little pricey..
5
We were surprised to just walk in and get a table for 3, very accommodating, lovely front of house staff Nov 24/25 and yes we dined there two nights running! We loved the super healthy salad, pizza, carbonara, steak with funky chips, and burgers were a work of art. Thank you Jamie'
4
Had the Bolognise. Was really good. The starter of "oozing garlic bread" was disappointing. Raw in the middel, needed something.
4
Went there 2 times so far, food is good (pasta and pizza gets 4 out of 5), setup is well designed, service is ok - sometimes a bit slow, but overall it's a good organized franchised Restaurant. Will be back when I'm in the area.
4
The ambiance of the restaurant is cozy and relaxing. Worth checking out if you are in Orchard road. .... Their pizza are freshly made ...thin crunchy crust and delicious.
4
The food was very good and reasonably priced for Singapore. it is family friendly and the service is very good.. It is a good place to go if you want a casual pizza or pasta meal..
4
OK, not a bad place if you are shopping around in Forum with your kids or are somewhere in the area. The food alone was good but not superb. Service was good but what really stands out is the open kitchen and the busy atmosphere.PROS & CONS+ Good location and great atmosphere+ Great 'famous linguine' dish+ very kids friendly (u r in Forum of course)+ Sirloin and rucola salad was good, fries a bit poor and oily+ Fast service, almost makes you think OMG this came out of the microwave but it did not taste like it- Crab risotto ball starter is extremely boring and almost no crab taste. Only rice- Overall really no wow -this is JO restaurant- effect. But still a good restauran
2
I went to this restaurant with much anticipation but was left terribly disappointed. Staff are poorly trained, with waitresses trying to escape work whenever possible, ignoring the tables. Service is often slow and disorganised despite the number of staff they have on shift, and the restaurant was only 20% full at 530pm... They can serve ice cream without spoons and take minutes to bring them when reminded. Food quality and taste is just passable. Tables are placed so closely next to each other where there is hardly any place to move and those tables for 2 are so small. There is really nothing to attract me here again as a repeat customer, and unfortunately for them, Singapore has many eateries as competitors..
5
As you would expect from JO, this is a great casual italian food diner with specials and good wines and the service is great. I love the platters, set out on tins of italian tomatoes and the special ragu beef with pasta was brill. Friends had prawn linguini, other pastas and the fresh fish dish - all good and well served
1
Bread selection which cost $8 was cold and hard. Could not taste any cheese in Italian nacho . Baked mushrooms come with miserable thin slices of mushrooms. The pasta were also Luke warm and taste like those mass produced pasta from fast food chain. The wait staff is not even certain of the kids menu when consulted. Would not return at all.
5
Hi,I walked in to this restaurant on a weekday. It was bustling, with just a few tables empty.The staff were very pleasant and helpful and quickly got me a solo table. It was a pleasure to eat such hearty healthy fare ... completely unpretentious and down to earth. No little drops of sauce or micro-greens dotting the plate. Honest Tasty food.As I was alone, I was limited in what I could manage to eat, but look forward to going back with my family soon
5
From the moment you open the door the place is buzzing. That hum of people replete with eating yummy food in a cosy atmosphere.We had eaten at Vivo. Nom Nom Nom. But we really felt looked after at forum. Michael worked some kind of magic to make a table available. Emma (who is so warm and welcoming)made us feel like the most important people there, as I'm sure she makes everyone feel. We watched the cutest moment with the family next to us where the waiter (with the dog purse in his apron) taught a wee scone grabber how to eat her spaghetti. The pork chop was the hero dish of the night and my husband had menu envy. But he made up for it with THAT cheesecake...As an aside; I asked Emma for some Italian coffee making equipment purchasing suggestions. She sent me to Tangs. Where I found exactly what I wanted. Just like family.
5
Nice food, great service. What else to get a little care of yourself. Very good location also for dinner with friends and loved ones.
4
Had lunch here a couple of weeks ago, for a chain it was actually very tasty. Service good and overall satisfied with my visit.
5
Food was absolutely brilliant. Had spaghetti, pizza, polenta chips, chips and salads. The italian wine was very good. Great Service. My friend I went with is Italian and she said the pizza was a good 'italian' pizza.
3
Visited Jamie's Italian for dinner on a Saturday night. As expected the place was full, but ten mins wait and we found a table by the pizza counter. The restaurant itself is beautifully laid out with a lovely upbeat contemporary feel. The service members were lovely, hospitable and ready to assist. The food in itself was average...in saying so it wasn't disappointing. The burger however, was exceptional. The meat was cooked to perfection and the patty was just a super top side steak as opposed to grounded meat. The pasta and ravioli was as good as any Italian place in Singapore...not a signature Oliver stamped dish. I would recommend the burger for those that visit. That is the only one that stood out of the norm.
3
We visited Jamie's soon after it's opening. The staff were friendly and attentive and we were served quickly. The food was average, maybe a bit overpriced considering it's competition in the area and in Singapore in general. The highlight was the brownie dessert, it's a must.
2
Opted to eat here as it was local to me at the time and late in the evening. On entry I was informed the kitchen was closing at 10 (about an hour later). I was seated at what turned out to be a regular walk through for the staff, although the space was a bit snug, however it all started to fall apart once I had ordered. I requested 3 drinks and was served 2, then I ordered an assorted bread starter and tuna steak main. Approximately 5 minutes later I was informed they were out of assorted breads, so I selected an alternative, which was served quite quickly. I finished the starter and and commenced the wait for the main, just before 10pm, the waiter informed me they were out of tuna and asked if I had not been informed. Concerned the kitchen was closing I had a quick glance at the menu and chose an alternative. The main when it arrived was very nice, however when I finished, I experienced another long wait for the bill. I also witnessed other solo diners suffering below par service, this is area that really should be improved upon as the food was good.
2
menu list is quite limited, table near the open kitchen is hot, - we had a bolognaise which had no meat and a burger (for S$35 ++) which was rare instead of medium well. Left most of the burger but the waiter not interested in why. We've been to two other Jamies which were great - but this is just plain poo
5
Was a pleasant surprise to find that I enjoyed this meal so much-had a wonderful grilled vegetable brushetta to start , followed by one of the daily specials which was baked sea bass-which was just delicious.Very friendly happy staff-served by Hazel, who was lovely
5
Such a lovely experience last night with your fun and adorable filipina waitress and manager who leads them fun working environment despite with a busy weekend during dinner. A filipina waitress caught our attention with her great service in terms of friendliness, as we observed everyone's movement and gestures, another staff which i think she is the manager because she wore different colour from the others, approached us politely and make us comfortable and we also didn't realize that she is asking how was the meal, service, so on and so fort. The sincerity of doing all these are not because they doing their job, we feel that they doing it because they enjoy and love their job. We can see how busy it is and everyone moving so fast to ensure all guest has been served. The manager lead the team very well, she leads by example her attentiveness, being friendly, giving direction at the same time she show her team that they enjoying while working. We took their name to recognize on their hard work, kudos to your team honey and sheila. Please extend our appreciation to them, keep it up! Thank you
4
Food was good. But could be better. We're charged $10 for Mineral Water, I didn't expect that hahaha
5
Excellent small dishes (appetizers) as well as great entrees in beautiful setting downtown Orchard. I love the baked mushrooms, cold cuts, salads, Italian nachos and the mushroom risotto. All great dishes that can be accompanied by really good red wines.
5
The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was great! Very homily feel about the place. Will definitely come back :)
3
The food was really good. Great choice of dishes. Unfortunately the atmosphere is terrible. Akin to a cafeteria playing loud doof doof music. Plus everyone is squeezed in. Thankfully we got a booth and not one of the tables.
5
Great restaurant with good and creative foods. My family had a great time there for dinner. Excellent and friendly services especially from our lovely waitress Ms. Sheila. My younger son enjoyed his kid's meal very much. My family had a really enjoyable evening at Jamie's Italian. We will definayely be back again!
4
Just had dinner with my family. We walked in on busy Saturday night and got a table after a short wait. My 5 year old boy was asleep. A friendly wait staff, Sheila helped to find an extra chair for him to sleep on, in spite of the place being fully packed. Special thank you as I could enjoy my wine and fries after that. Great time.
5
I headed there for dinner just after 6.30pm. I seemed to get the last table for one, and the restaurant was soon packed out with locals and tourists. I think I got a bit confused between good, attentive service, and being rushed. I was perhaps far too worried that they would need the table back ASAP and therefore tried to rush ordering. After a fantastic superfood salad of heritage carrots and avocado to start, I had a signature ‘Funghi’ pizza, with chargrilled onions and smoked cheese. It was probably one of the best I’ve had recently, topped with rocket and parmesan for an extra flavour kick. The kale and yoghurt slaw I had on the side worked really well with pizza. I skipped desert, and my worries about being rushed out were abolished when 15 minutes after finishing I had to ask for the bill – I was expecting it to be delivered as an alternative to the desert menu immediately after finishing! Very good and convenient location.
5
Thank you, our dinner and the service was excellent and when I reflect on others in the restaurant, which was full, they were enjoying themselves. From the simplicity of the menu to the atmosphere I have no complaints only my compliments for a great night - Salute
2
Nothing great to write home about. I admire Jamie a lot and he's more than just a great chef or a good businessman. He's genuinely made an impact on the way the world eats but this restaurant was a disappointment.
3
Nice decor, some signature elements. Very difficult to be consistent running restaurant chains. Very family style as Forum has lots of kids activities. Music was a bit loud, friendly service but a bit slow. Ordered their signature prawn linguine was spicy and a bit flat. Ingredients fresh but doesn't have the same signature flavors, tasted like any other ordinary Italian chain like Sbarro but at higher prices ! Chef needs more training now more like a cook ;)
3
Unlike it's Hong Kong cousin, the service at this restaurant was attentive and engaging. It was casual without being familiar.. so I give them high marks for that. The food was ok, a little ordinary, not bad, but not wow. I am missing the "star" element here... if it did not have that fancy name over the entrance, I would not have guessed and ticked this off as just another western restaurant in Singapore
3
Food was average. Service staff were helpful. Cool place for big groups as the atmosphere is lively.
5
Great atmosphere. Good value for money & staff were very friendly. Good location - Orchard Road & close to hotels.
4
Enjoyed the food and staff was really friendly. We had a great time and will definitely go back again.
5
I have booked a table a day before reaching Singapore and it was great that they had my name down at the reservation list when I walked into the restaurant. The reason why I have to mention this, it was because when I called for reservation, I couldn't leave them a contact number as I was calling from overseas. My partner and I were there during lunch time, and it was very packed. Thankfully we had a booking so we didn't have to wait for a table. The server was really attentive and had us some cold water while we go through the menu. The pork chop was amazing and the portion was good too. The price was not too expensive. It would equivalent to a standard meal at Hard Rock Cafe. The ambience was okay but do expect to have minimal space since they are squeezing all the space they have to accommodate the customers. Should you need a bigger space, i.e. to put your shopping bags etc, please ask for a bigger table. I would recommend this restaurant to all foodies out there. Eat your heart out! :
3
I have learnt a lot of cooking techniques from Jamie's books and TV shows, so I was curious to try one of his chain restaurants. The pasta portions were good sized -the risotto seemed a bit more skimp-, the appetizers were pretty good, but overall nothing that I can't do myself at home following his greatly accessible recipes, for a fraction of the price. Not a bad place by any measure, but does not stand out from the plethora of goodish overpriced Italian restaurants in Singapore.
3
The Service is extremely poor and not professional, they are for the most with an enormous lack of knowledge about food&beverages service [ part time students for the most]The quality of the food is average compared to the price, annex services to the food are low level [everyone is served by different timing, waiting time for drinks after food served and requested many times, the coffee served before desert].Just to make an Italian Fresh Past does not mean be an Italian Restaurant.The decoration blow your eyes, the service explode your patience, the price will disappoint you compared to the service

As a big fan of Jamie from his efforts in Los Angeles and his cooking shows I was expecting much better. In fact it has the potential to be better.Over all the food was 'ok'. My opinion, if I can make at home better, then it's not for me.Now if you are looking for average then you are in luck. From the apertizer to the main (ragu pasta) it was ok... nothing special about the flavors or presentation. The service seemed rushed, not sure why.Jamie, send a few undercover foodies and you will understand. I am in Singapore for the week and try it again and see. If needed I will update this post. If you see no updates then it says it all

We visited on a Saturday night with 6 people. All up we ordered 6 starters, a main each and a couple of deserts. Total bill came to about $480.We had some cocktails which were great. Starters were ok albeit small for the price and a little on the bland side. The mains are a decent size for the price but the actual food was total hit and miss. The biggest problem was my pasta dish: Rigatoni Pomodoro. When it first arrived the pasta was completely under cooked and the sauce less than luke warm as well as completely under seasoned.I complained and the waiter offered to get it sorted. So far so good... 25 minutes later the whole table had finished dinner and I was still sitting there with no food. After asking several times the food finally arrived... this time the pasta was overcooked and still bland but I was so hungry I ended up eating it anyway.Here a good advice to their chefs. If you don't know how to cook pasta have a look at the packet. They usually print the time it takes to cook the pasta al'dente on there somewhere. Also, a bit of salt and pepper goes a long way in the kitchen.Perhaps Jamie should start hiring some mystery shoppers to test the quality of food in his restaurants.Desert was ok

Ordered the prawn linguine and funghi pizza but all taste normal only. Went there with high hopes but came back disappointed. Modestos serve better pizzas and pastas

Singapore has a lot of food. When someone famous opens a restaurant in Singapore people expect something "wow" to exist. Jamie's Italian provides good, wholesome italian food which is good but there are many others producing the same or similar fare in Singapore. There is little that really makes you go "wow" but plenty that makes you go "oh, that's good". The staff are friendly and competent, the food is reliably good, but if you're looking for something really special there are many better restaurants in Singapore run by Italians. Jamie would have been better off bringing top end British cuisine to Singapore with some wow factor ! This restaurant may reinforce Jamie's reputation for wholesome food but does little to add weight to his reputation as a top chef. We enjoyed the experience but it wasn't what most people expect when a famous chef puts his name over the door

Brought my sweetheart to surprise him over pizza and wine for his birthday and had a great time, thank you for arranging the candles!

We walked in to a packed restaurant without a reservation on Friday evening and enjoyed drinks at the bar for 30 mins whilst we waited for a table.We got off to a good start with the crispy squid starter which was light with a zesty dip.After a long wait we were told that something went wrong with our order so they comped us bread & dips whilst they prepared another dish.But after another 20 minutes of waiting we had consumed our body weight in bread, so when the entrees arrived we totally over it.After we left 1/2 finished meals, the waitress apologised again, saying that they were struggling to cope with such a busy evening.Might be worth a try on a quiet night, but I'd recommend you give it a miss on a busy night until they get their $#!+ together

If you want a Jaimie Oliver experience skip this joint. It can best be described as a family spaghetti joint. It is situated in a shopping mall and busy. Try Jaimie's at Vivo City for better ambiance. The food is average and the service is ok. It is not a place for business meals

My partner & I went for a short staycation nearby the area to celebrate her birthday. Decided to walk around and check out what food is nice around that area and we walk in to Jamie's Italian without any reservation. Managed to get a table for 2 and ordered risotto ball and a pasta dish. The risotto ball is so so only but the pasta is nice. Tomato base and with a lot of prawn. I would like to mention an outstanding staff for his excellent service provided. He is Shaun. Upon asking the bill, my partner wanted to pay for the meal but I asked Shaun to pass the bill to me as that day is my partner's birthday. Shaun not only did not pass the bill to her but he asked us to wait for awhile as there will be a complimentary birthday cake for my partner. My partner and I are quite reluctant to accept the cake as we did not make any reservation. Shaun assured us there will be no problem for that and he said "This is Jamie's Italian" We are so grateful for his thoughts and surely make our day memorable. We will definitely be back again to try out the other dishes in the menu

Arrived without a booking on a Sunday night was told 30 minute wait but it was less than that. Once food was ordered, mind you we couldn't get one meal because it wasn't available, table service was slow. Food was just warm and my pasta wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Desserts again were out of the epic brownie but the cheesecake was nice. Tables were jammed in far to close,expected a bit more ambience for all the hype surrounding these restaurants. Probably wouldn't bother to visit the ones back in Australia

The meal was very good. We sampled the pizzas, which were made on the spot with fresh dough. 25 Dollars and would feed only one person. The taste was excellent. Great ink pasta with mussels and seafood. Cooked at perfection, and the capers added a lot of freshness / originality to a dish which can be dead boring sometimes. We also had side salads which were delicious, The service was courteous, even though a bit unflexible ..why not leave your name ? Why do we have to literally sit and wait for 30 mn ? Just leave your name. Send a SMS like at PS Cafe ? Also ...nobody told us that there Specials on the menu . Friendly waiters, but some training would be advised. We paid 170 Sing for 4 including 2 fruit cocktails and 2 bottles of water. Not cheap but again the meal was good

As a.N,american, i usually wouldn't be travelling to Asia and then, eating food that isn't the local fare. But, my hosts insisted this restaurant was the newest, the latest. Well, maybe, i was hyped up too much. We waited 10mins even though we had a reservation. I ordered the PRAWN LINGUINE.... typically, italizn dishes wouldve called this SHRIMP LINGIINE.... which it was. IT WAS NOT PRAWN. Does Jaime Oliver know what prawns are? I seriously doubt it. They was mini-shrimps in the linguine.... basically, salad shrimp, not even cocktail shrimp. And the bill? I felt bad that my hosts had waited to experience this disappointment of restaurant . Won't be entering any Jaime restaurant anytime soon... but this restaurant is over-rated
4
We walked in on a Saturday around 12:30 and were told it would be a 30 min wait but it only ended up to be around a 10 minute wait. We shared a pasta and some salads, bruschetta & polenta chips. All delicious. From memory the menu is a bit smaller than at VivoCity but it was handy as we were staying in the Orchard Rd area so it was fine for lunch. Service was quite good too. Yes its not cheap but it is Singapore after all

I visited this place about 1 month after the opening, attracted by the fact that it is part of Jamie Oliver's restaurants.The restaurant is always full and you need to book it in advance (you can do it online) or be prepared to wait for long time to get a table; we were not lucky the first night, but we reserved a table for the second one.Finally the night arrived and we reached the restaurant in advance; we entered and the receptionist told us that the reservation was made for the next month...then it was a joke...ah ah... don't joke with hungry people.We ordered a bruschetta with avocado (I don't remember the name) and arancini...both of them disappointing, arancini were very far from the original ones and the cheese was probably hidden in the kitchen instead that in the food itself...if this was the starting, I was ready to have a bad dinner.As main course, we got special stuffed pasta (cannelloni) in three different ways, ricotta and spinach, aubergine and pumpkin. All of them were ok, a bit on the salty side, but average, for sure not at the standard that I would have expected.The second main was a beef steak, ordered medium and served almost medium rare (but I prefer like that, it was ordered medium by my colleague); this was tasty and tender, it is definitely the thing we enjoyed more!Overall not a fantastic meal, definitely average and I would not return in this restaurant unless the quality really goes up to other standards

Good choice with my 4 year old son as he was happy with the crayons, menu selection video toy and the food. I was pleased to see that we received a bottle of tap water on the table and no desert on children's menu. Kiddie veggies were good, but served after the main arrived, so made it harder to fill my son with veggies.My pizza was good quality so I was pleased with that.The music was far to loud, seats were crowded together and all of the merchandise for sale on all the shelves was a bit oppressive. If you are going to visit, get a booth, the tables in the middle are a disaster especially if you are average size or larger. One visit is enough, there is no need to go back as there are plenty of cheaper, better quality restaurants with nicer environments in Singapore
2
The dinner started off badly, two male receptionists who just couldn't be bothered told us "we have given your table away" as we dont hold for than 15 minutes. We were late, however had called ahead and arrived at the restaurant 13 minutes before our reservation.We received no apology from the receptionists, however went to the bar and ordered a drink. We were then told table was free, neither the serving staff or the receptionists made any attempt to show us to the table and didnt offer to bring our drinks over.An extensive menu and fairly well presented, if anything too much choice given.Orders were well taken and delivered in sensible time, food tasty but not really memorable.Desert was a joke and we opted to skip as we were told the Gelato could not be mixed and that they had run out of toppings.Huge disappointment and clearly below the quality suggested by the brand.
2
I went there with colleagues. Good music if you like the 70's 80's. But the food was below par. Dessert was very weak: I had a Pavlova. Far from my expectations

Great choices for the kids. Lovely food and it was all delicious. Always feel a bit rushed when your first drink and the food all arrive together. Kids enjoyed - would go bac

I went to Jamie's for my sister's 17th birthday and it was very busy because it just opened. The tables were too close together and the chairs were very low and my family is pretty tall. When we sat down we got several butts against our backs from other people trying to get to their table. When I ordered an ice water they gave me an ice chocolate shake... Even though the restaurant was way too noisy the food was still good and my steak was cooked beautifully. I don't think we will visit this restaurant again because it was pretty expensive
3
Recently visited Jamie Oliver's restaurant. The food was ok, but nothing special. Ordered tomato salad (came in a tiny portion), funghi pizza and a brownie (was too sweet). The service was not great. Waited for a long time to even get drinks. Overall, wouldn't rate as very good, but okay-ish. Book way in advance, don't do walk-ins. There was a long line of people waiting to be seated.
3
The place offers a nice casual ambiance.The food was ok and not super special.We were super disappointed with the wine collection. It was really limited and not a good collection at all, especially the ones by glass.  
3
It was ok and if you like Jamie's then it won't disappoint, but when you get the final bill you will wonder why you paid all that just to go to a franchise of an English chef's version of Italian cooking. And I doubt he has even set foot in the building.Went to Jamie's last night at the last minute as I got the intended restaurant booking wrong. I wasn't planning to go as I had read the reviews and wasn't inspired. Arrived with no booking at about 7:30 and was seated in 10 minutes. The food was fine. The faults were first in service, we had to ask for a meal that didn't come with the others. Oddly enough it was the only cold dish amongst hot, not sure how a cold dish can take longer, unless it was forgotten. The cold dish was the cold meat plate, don't order this as anything other than a single person mouthful, it was tiny. Lastly the bill, and this is probably its biggest drawback. Don't go here for a cheap meal. It is anything but cheap. And coming from Perth where eating out is ridiculously expensive as a norm, this was worse. 2 breads, 1 cold meat, 2 starter pastas, one main pasta and 2 glasses of wine $186. I worked it out against Jamie's Perth and the same meal in Perth would have been $45 less. If my review was solely based on value for money I would not recommend going. Sorry Jamie but fresh basic Italian food shouldn't cost this much, what a shame

I realize they've only been open over a month - but I thought I'd give JI's another try (we tried it first week of opening). I am disappointed. A calamari starter - large size - was 'tiny' - and overpriced, though tasty. Pasta main was average - not authentically Italian in flavour either - meh. I was disappointed. I asked four times for a glass of water (seriously???). What's going on with service at this location? Its' bad and needs a revamp. There were so many service staff standing around doing absolutely nothing, I was confused as to why it took four attempts to get a drink. Sigh. I won't be back anytime soon

We visited on Friday18/09 and chose this place to have a late lunch because most other places had stopped serving. My wife had their special which was cannelloni and I chose the steak. i noticed the steak came with coleslaw which I am not keen on, and cant recall ever seeing on a menu. I told the waiter about that and she came back and said ever so nicely that the chef would not change it. So I assumed it was made to go with steak in a hot climate, so I agreed. My meal arrived after quite a wait (it was about 3.00 pm so there not too many people) and the coleslaw which had some sort of garnish on it tasted fine, as did the steak. However my wife's cannelloni was not presented in the traditional "roll" manner but as small "cakes". My wife ( who was born in italy), said It was only entree size, she could not taste the pasta at all, and just did not like it. A few hours later when at the airport I had to go to the toilet 3 times. I could only have a plain ham roll for my tea at the airport and was limited to a single bread roll on the aircraft. Not good to have this problem on an overnight flight. The hostess was worried that I had ebola. It was obviously the coleslaw that I was not allowed to change.This was our first and certainly our last visit to any restaurant that has the name of Jamie Oliver on it. The service was also very ordinary and amateurish

We have been to Jamie Italian 3 times for dinner now. Each time, the service is consistently poor. The environment feels like a packed zoo, with little kids everywhere. Service is poor.On our 2nd visit, we asked how the server was, and she yawned saying it was a late night the night before, and she was so tired. The wine we wanted was not available - apparently someone bought 12 bottles the night before for a "private party". After we asked her to check again, she managed to locate the last bottle.On our 3rd visit, the server hover next to our table until she took our order.Service is consistently poor. I wonder how such a great restaurant with Jamie Oliver's name can have service poorer than some of the regular Italian restaurants. Not enough training? Then again, we have given it 3 opportunities to improve, and each time it is bad over the past 2 months.Food is the saving grace:This is probably the only saving grace for the restaurant. They have out of this world pasta. We have tried the following:Prawn Linguine - al dente pasta, chewy in the center. So delicious. I ordered a small portion, as we wanted to try the Crispy Porcini Mushroom Arancini for appetizer. The Bellini drink was nice too, but not chilled enough.Octopus and Mussel Spaghetti was nice. It is not the typical black ink sauce, but a white whine sauce. Unfortunately, too many capers made the whole dish sour. We had it the 2nd time last night, and it was better in the sense that it was not too salty. The 1st time I had it, it was so salty.Wild mushroom risotto - probably the only bad main dish we have had here. Very salty, soft risotto rice. I didn't even bother to finish it, but it was $26.50Pizza - very nice dough. Crispy, home made, delicious.Epic brownie - like the name said, it was epic. We had it both times. Very lovely, with some caramelized popcorn on top, lovely home made ice cream (amaretto flavor, not the usual vanilla) and very nice and warm brownie. Not too sweet. Just purr-fect.Thank you

Brucetta with crab and avocado. Olivier might have taken the crab himself, not in My brucetta .
Spagetti with bolognese sauce was good.
And the waitress from Milano/ Italy, Anna, was pretty, serviceminded and effective.😜

My mother is a fan of Jamie Oliver, so I decided to take her to his restaurant while we were in Singapore. Our table was not ready at the time that we were told to be there and we were warned that they could only hold our table for 15 minutes if we fail to show up. Yet we had to wait 35 minutes for our table, despite booking in advance.We ordered the food and the wine. I think that the waiter had never opened a bottle of wine at that point. It took him a solid two minutes to get the cork out and after that he was so nervous and his hands were shaking so he failed to pour the wine properly to our glasses, we had to clean up the mess he had made on the table before we could taste the $120 bottle of wine. Whilst the waiter was struggling with the wine bottle, I noticed that another waiter, whom I assume has more experience, was watching him fail from a distance with a really worried expression. I'm guessing he didn't feel the need to interfere. The food was served relatively quick and tasted great. Halfway through our dinner, we were asked very nicely by a waiter if it would be possible for us to be moved to another table as another bigger group was coming in shortly. No problem, we said we'd move and they assured us that everything on our table would end up on our new table. Once we moved, they swiftly decided to take away a bottle of water that we had paid for and throw it in the bin. As we had different servers bringing each different item on the menu, I informed a couple of the staff that was closest to us at the time that the bottle of water that we ordered was taken away during our table shift and that I would like that bottle of water. Afterall, Singapore is a very hot and humid place.Overall, the food was great - tasty indeed but the staff needs training. I believe that you go to a restaurant to get an overall experience which includes the ambiance, food and service

We went there on Monday night for dinner. Booked online,the place was full and bustling. My kids love Jamie as do we and so we were all excited to eat there. Started off well, the kids got a bucket of things for entertainment. We ordered a kids spaghetti, a pizza for my son. My husband and I shared the meat plank for starters, a carbonara and the seared tuna salad for mains. The spaghetti came out quickly which was great. Meat plank arrived, and this was a highlight (although a bit of bread on the side could've been suggested as there was none served with it). We were almost finished when my sons pizza was served. He loved it. My husbands pasta was served pretty much the same time, we were still finishing our starter. Plate was removed to make room for his main... And then we waited.... His pasta was cold when my salad arrived, over 10 minutes later. But the plank and my plate was still left on the table. Sent the mains back as pasta was now cold. When it came back my husband added salt and pepper but both grinders contained salt. Notified the waitress. She swapped them over with a table near by, so some other customer will now experience the double salt later on. Poor service let this place down for us, which was disappointing as we expected more for a restaurant with Jamie Oliver's name on it. Our mains weren't too bad, but wouldn't be raving about either meal. Received a verbal apology from the waitress, but then she walked away empty handed whilst all our empty plates were still on the table. By this time we just skipped dessert, and left. Still glad we tried it, but wouldn't go back again.

Stopped here mid afternoon for a quick, light lunch. This place gets real busy but singles or small groups can sit at the counter. I had a starter pasta and a drink. The service was rapid and the fettuccine bolognese actually delicious, so I left very satisfied within 30 mins. Well done
1
Thought I should check out Jamie's for myself despite the many negative and scathing reviews from friends and colleagues who've been there. I should've trusted them. Ordered Prawn Linguine and Octopus Nero. It's obvious the seafood was not fresh, especially the octopus and mussels, which tasted and looked like it came from the frozen section of some supermarket. The restaurant, while welcoming with its warm and woody interiors, failed to deliver on its most fundamental offering - food. I didn't even want to bother with the dessert and went downstairs to grab some Nonya Kuih instead. Overpriced and so overrated it's not even funny
3
We went to this place with another family and the service was good but the food was a hit and miss. First the garlic bread was awesome and all the kids finished all their meals (except the greens - which tasted abit funny). However the downside was my main paste as it was very tough and under cook. The desert was only ok as it was too sweet for my liking (might be ok for others). The environment was pretty good as there was a lot of people and the decorations was nice. They even had colouring for the children which we dearly miss from America. So overall this was only an average experience and good family restaurant
4
We had a business lunch and as I was staying at the Hilton hotel which is right next to the restaurant, I managed to get a table, last minute with "connections". Very busy place, good still a long way to be perfect, but trendy and with friendly service. I had a burger which was well presented and the Epic Brownie was great. Not cheap.
3
We were very excited to try this restaurant because I'm a fan of Mr. Jamie Oliver. We went to have early dinner. The staff were not very welcoming to begin with. We also had a hard time catching their attention whenever we need something. The food was rather pricey that's why we're expecting to be wowed. We ordered arancini balls (dry and tasteless), polenta chips ( okay), kale slaw ( plenty and refreshing), kid's pasta (average), Jamie's burger ( very disappointing, patty overcooked and under seasoned, bun was soggy and didn't come with fries, you have to pay extra) and chicken with some sort of mushroom sauce (tasty but ruined by a soggy bread underneath the chicken. The best part of the meal for me is the dessert, their almond tart was really delicious although the slice was quite small. This is just your average Italian restaurant, nothing special. You're better off trying somewhere else

Delightful restuarant, excellent food and choice, all dishes treid over 4 visits excellent, looked after kids requirements very very well, great friendly staf

Went dinner yesterday evening at 5:30, this is first time we visited this new branch, the Frontline waiter was told need to be wait for about 30 minutes, but we received message and a called from restaurant at 5:45pm to informed the table is ready for us. The staff very helpful and the food are fantastic. We love both restaurant another branch at Vivocity. â˜

So refreshing to find informed and interested service in a singapore restaurant. One can tell the staff are thorough trained, more than in several so called fine dining restaurants in singapore. Simple correct combinations of heart Italian fare. All requested extras are remembered and delivered with a smile. Highly recommended..

When you need something else than street food this is a very good place to go. The food is absolutely worth trying and the wine and juices are also very good. The service are in top

i visited yesterday as a walk in guest at 5pm and was told that i could only have the seat till 630pm as they were busy for the night. this is not an uncommon practice in restaurants for walk in customers and so i agreed as 1.5 hours was decent for dinner.however, the moment i sat down and was handed the menu, i was expected to order immediately. i asked for a few moment to decide and the filipino server left my table without acknowledging my request.food was alright. i wasn't especially blown away. and once they cleared the plate at 550pm, i was asked if i wanted desert, i declined and was asked immediately "DO YOU WANT THE BILL NOW?" so it was clear that albeit we were given till 630pm for dinner, if we do not want to spend anymore after our meal, we had to leave.so 52 minutes and $165.35 later, i left the restaurant. feeling unwelcomed and underwhelmed. i believe that for the money spent for that level of service and food, i could have gone to a better place

didn't have high expectation so i was pleasantly surprised.shrimp linguine: very goodburger: excellent beef but buns disintegrated once wetcheesecake: very good

Our booking had not been recorded and only after ten minutes of negotiation and having to find the booking confirmation on my phone were we eventually shown to our table. Not a good start. My wife and I both ordered the beef risotto which was a daily special. There was plenty of rice but very little beef and the taste was more akin to a 'rendang'. Fortunately it was served hot together with the funky chips. Admittedly we both had a milano beverage (campari, orange and prosecco) but for one course and a total price of S$115.00 the one course meal was not good value. The service was good and professional and the ambience is pleasant

Jamie's Italian is a franchise business whose only connection with Jamie Oliver is the name. I visited here twice this week as I am staying close by for work. On the first occassion I opted for the carbonara with a rocket salad. The carbonara was just ok, the pancetta was not pancetta as I know it but very thin slivers of bacon. The salad would have been nice if it hadn't been covered in salt. As I was still hungry I had a dessert, the warm chocolate fudge brownie with ice cream which was not warm and was rock hard. My daughter makes a better one to be honest. All in all a big disappointment. I expected a lot more. I thought I would give Jamies the benefit of the doubt so went a second time, this time I had the rump steak. A very poor quality and small piece of meat, covered in so much salt it is was almost inedible, What;s with covering the food in so much salt? I also noticed people eating the pizza, which was also pretty small.In my opinion, if you want nice pizza and pasta, go up the road to La Forketta, they do it so much better with far better quality ingredients. If you want steak, there are much better options such as Hard Rock or Tony Romas.The ambience of the place is nice, a good place to go with friends but not for good quality eats, I will not retur

Second attempt at finding a good meal at Jamie's in Singapore. First try @ Vivocity on opening night was a disaster with both my wife and I getting a tummy upset - eating completely different items.Second one tonight @ Forum - ordered the polenta chips, margherita pizza, risotto balls, lamb chops... Didn't even venture into other mains... Food lacks taste or even freshness... They won't amend any items, which is fine - if they serve generally tasty food.Wouldn't say much more - Avoid
3
We just popped in and were told there was a half an hour wait. Then when we asked about a bar table turned out they had availability -- why haven't they started with that? That's puzzling. Food came out quite fast, although appetizer, bread and mains came at the same time, while they kept us waiting in the meantime. Food was quite delicious, although portions are small and don't seem to be a good value

We tried this newly opened Jamie's recently on Orchard Road. It's a good thing we booked in advance, because it was packed - and noisy. I commented to the English waitress who took me to my table about the noise level, and she said it would get noisier as the night wore on. The music was a bit loud, so diners talked even louder to hear each other. And because it's so popular, they pack the tables pretty close together, so this isn't a place for a quiet, romantic getaway.The food is pretty much as tasty as you imagine Jamie Oliver's dishes are when you watch him describe his dishes on his TV shows. For starters, we have the "best" olives on ice and the cauliflower fritti. The olives with tapenade were ok, but the cauliflower was out of this world. We ordered a second helping, it was so good.For mains, we had the rotolo al forno (pumpkin, squash and spinach in pasta sheets with tomatoes, herbs and others), a hot italian pizza and tagliatelle bolognese, with rocket salad and a kale slaw on the side. The pastas and salads were excellent, but the pizza dough was a bit chewy. We had a nice Italian Sauvignon Blanc with the meal and topped it all up with mango and black currant sorbets.The service was very good, with a very friendly, helpful and efficient waitress (Hani, I recall her name), which helped a lot, because some of the other servers were not too friendly or responsive when signalled to.In summary, generally very good food as expected from a Jamie Oliver's, but a bit loud when crowded and inconsistent service

Unfortunately VERY disappointing. And no value for money.2 pax; 2 apperitivi, 2 veg. entres, 2 veg. mains: 140S$. even for singapore to expensive for what u get. We booked a table online for 9.30 pm and then got told to order quick 'cause kitchen will be closed soon. -I have to say i can understand that they have opening hours but if u accept bookings untill 9.45 in my oppinion u cant expect your clients to order in 5 min.incl. dessert, thats very unprofessional, for many reasons!our entres avocado & crab bruschetta and veggie platter were nice. But Risotto and Ravioli were SOOO blend. Risotto was still to hard and just boring. Ravioli dough was ok but not special.-The inside was full of spinach but just a dot of ricotta chesse. Sauce was..... boring. Also i have to say that the food came ways to quick, they didnt even clear our entres before serving the mains. so we had all the plates on our table. didnt like that.**so please, Dont take bookings after 9 if u wanna shut down at 10.**Service had no experience ; not professional at all, but they tried their best i guess. Enteriour is nice and cozzy. liked that
