Good deal with 1-1 promo for mains and pizza. Friendly service, good location near the pier. Tasty food

A bar and restaurant that boasts a wide selection of alcohol that provides excellent pairing to an impressive dining menu. It's more than meets the eye and more

Went there with a friend for the 1-for-1 lunch bowl but was appalled that the portion is so small. However, service and ambience was good.

I made an reservation through the Chope APP for an 1-1 promo, the waitress was very professional and courtress to listen to our requests for orders and drinks.Food was served promptly with not much waiting time.Iâ€™ll give a 8/10 for the sirloin steak that I ordered, medium rare

First time here and it was for lunch. The food is yummy! The salmon lunch bowl is actually salad with salmon that is seared just right to my liking. Also had the Asian prawn pizza - it is highly recommended! Every slice very fairly has half a prawn on it, which is greatly appreciated. The lychee on it makes it very refreshing. I'm coming back for more

We were a group of 14 and the service staff made sure we had comfortable seating outdoors since the space indoor was too small.It took some time for our orders to arrive. The food and drinks were okay. My ribeye was a disappointment give the price I paid. It was too stringy and the portion was small.Not too excited about the price vs. portion. They could've done much better with the serving size or offer more attractive pricing

Great place for business lunch. Not overly crowded and staffs are attentive. Prices on the higher end.

Superb location, lovely food and wine, and staff that make the whole experience worth repeating time and time again. Seri and Gretzie are so attentive and friendly, as are the whole team!
Thank you all; I'll be back soon :-)

We were here two times during our visit and they served very tasty burger and fries. The bucket of beers were cheap compared to other similar places.

Had lunch with a friend. Had never been here so decided to give it a shot. Nice selection of salads which was what I was looking for. Had the Salmon skin salad which wasn't too bad. Staff were attentive and pleasant. If you're looking for a reasonable place to catch up with a small group of firiends, this isn't a bad place

We popped into Barnacles for an early dinner before heading to the airport for a flight.back to Australia.I was a bit concerned about the lack of knowledge in relation to gluten by the waitress, when making inquiries. Good thing the chef was all over it.We both thoroughly enjoyed our meals and would not hesitate eating here again.The location is perfect to look over Marina Bay. Suggest you book a table outdoors to enjoy the lights/show in the evening

I was here for national day and without doubt it was the worst experience I have had in my two years in Singapore. The service was slow, they incorrectly ordered at least two of the people's dishes I was with. They didn't serve one of the people in our party at all, even after we asked four or five times. They were short staffed and the ones they had were pretty much inept. Drinks with slow, arguably watered down and stupidly expensive. And all of this was a real shame because the food was half decent and the view was amazing.

It is a great place for lunch and dinner. They offer pizza, spaghetti, salad, wine and other alcohol drinks. I have my lunch here, their spaghetti is so good. Highly recommended. It cost about SGD20-30 for a meal, and the drinks is reasonable price. This place is good for small family gathering, fit from 20 people sitting indoor, to around 40 people standing. Nice window view too. The staff service is Great, friendly and they know the menu very well.

The bar/restaurant theme suits the view very well! The ambience of the place is very lively as the service crews are very alert and kind. The food is fantastic and i can tell its made with passion because of the presentation and taste. I would recommend trying the burger as its personally my favourite. I would definitely go to the restaurant again

Perfect candidate for Ramsay's kitchen nightmare Service is SO bad, staff does not communicate. Our food arrived at the table randomly within in a full hour time range, wrong drinks were served, and only after being requested 2 times. My dad didn't even get his dish because they were out of ingredients. After several requests he walked to the kitchen only to find out they didn't have it. Don't go here
