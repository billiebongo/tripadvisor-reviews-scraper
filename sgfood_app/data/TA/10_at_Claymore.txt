Last night we had a four generation Lo Hei 10@Claymore, food was sumptuous especially the Dong Po Braised Pork Belly, we crave for more.The service extended by Liliane and Farlini exceeded our expectation!And Azarul was cheerful at the counter. Chef Patrick and his team provide uswith such a wonderful culinary certainly deserved a praised .We will come back soon .Thank you,Yours Truly,Eddie Ta

They do not have the longest or largest buffet but the selection is sufficiently interesting.From sashimi, steaks, local favorites and dessert, most of the dishes were well executed and of high quality. The service staff was attentive and prompt in clearing. Being not a buffet enthusiast, I like this little outfit for offering good and well thought selection.
5
Comfy lighting and seating. The restaurant is spacious - good for hangout. Food is tasty (not overly salty or sweet). Seafood is fresh, especially the salmon and tuna sashimi. Wide variety of dessert. I love the chocolate icecream and 3 layer chocolate fondue.We had a wonderful afternoon buffet lunch.
5
My friend and me went for the high tea and Arjun was the best ever. His service and friendliness was top notch.
5
Celebrated our little girl's first birthday at the lobby lounge (this was after our previous event at the lobby lounge for our little boy, slightly over a year back), and we were exceedingly impressed by Arjun and team because of their high service standards!Arjun saw to all the little details from set-up to end, to ensure the party ran smoothly; guests needs were met in a timely manner; and that we all enjoyed ourselves! Arjun's dedication and exemplary service was complimented by many of our guests! The delectable buffet spread prepared by the head chef also made our event one that we will fondly remember! Tks so much, Arjun and team! Kudos to the chef as well

Go there if you have no choice , the chef specially one who makes Indian food is maybe someone learnt three dishes to cook and that to failed n learning them.Staff just wants you to eat and leave as they are overworked.Check for dinner buffet as it does not happen everyday ,w e stayed there for 5 days and it was on once only 
4
We had the buffet and found it be nice but nothing to really rave about. Good range of seafood though. We found it very hard to get a glass of wine and beer as the waitress said it wasn't available in the buffet area. We explained that we were happy to pay extra and that swayed her a little, but she was very reluctant to accommodate us. We did eventually get what we wanted. Prices were far too high for this buffet and that was with discount as we were staying there.
4
It will set you back at about 98++ for two peoplebut it's worth it. They have a good seleection of Oysters which alwayws have a looooong queue for at the buffet so do head there early for dinner to avoid disppointment. They wont run out but you may pend quite a bit of time in lie if you arrive at the peak time. there's loads of other food also. there's nan open steak grill which you can have steak cooked right in front of you. order a meduim and it will be juicy
5
When for the Xmas festive buffet. While the selection is relatively limited (for the S$72++ per adult) the quality is much better than the others that I have been to such as the Marriott Cafe , Swisshotel and Hilton. In this particular occasion the lamb chops were exceptionally good and the king crab and lobsters were good. They also served TWG tea which is definitely the exception. Will be back
1
I used to rave about the buffet here a year ago. Would bring the family once every 2 months.However with their new "menu", quality and quantity had went down. They used to have three types of fresh oyster. Now they just give you one type baked in cheese. Their manager claim "this is a better way to eat the oyster".The raw seafood overcooked, the prawn noodle soup diluted and the rest is meh. The price remains expensively the same though. So not worth coming here. Usually had to book days in advance. Now the restaurant was not even half fullGo somewhere else for buffe
3
Had a festive buffet dinner on Christmas Day for $128.We were looking forward to the seafood but but the crabs and lobsters disappointing. They were not very fresh and they were no raw oysters. Deserts, meats and foie gras were so so. Cheese selection was little. On the bright side, we were seated away from the noisy crowd which was good. We really enjoyed the prawn noodles which were very flavourful. The baked oysters were delicious, prawns were fresh. The service was good and staff were professiona
4
The so called festive delights were not that delightful as they promoted. Less varieties. No more special of the day menu. I booked on Chope. Surprisingly the restaurant alleged they did not know where I booked from and it took me 20min to prove that I was entitled with a 20% discount when it came to payment, even after I got confirmation both on the phone beforehand and at the reception on arrival
4
Value-for-money. Unfortunately, the dining was touted as festive feasting but turkey and roast beef were absent
4
When you dine here, don’t expect a wide buffet spread. Instead, focus and expect on quality food being served and you’ll not be disappointed. Char kway teow is a must try! So are their laska and crepes
5
Spread was not as wide ranging as other hotels, but service was immaculate and attentive. Wish they had fresh oysters though.We got married here in Jun 16 and came back with parents and a new baby - very happy to be back.They also have complimentary parking with the meal which is perfect. Of course the UOB 20% off helped
4
The food is ok. The service is good and they serve with a smile. The ambience is cozy and not crowded
3
The place is small, sitting arrangements are rather tight.It looks more like a small cafe instead.Not much variety of food. The seafood are not really fresh. The lobsters don't taste well. However, the meats are fine. Consider the best in the house.Deserts, so so but the fruits are fresh. The service was good however, the nets machine was having issues connecting to have the bill settled only in about 10mins
4
I brought My wife and in-laws to savour advertised the Grilled Rack of lamb. Unfortunately none was to be found on that Saturday evening. As they Do Not Eat Beef and are not seafood lover , I could sense from their facial expression the limited selection. The variety /selection was indeed much lacking. Dessert for Festive season was much limited. They did however, enjoy the crepes. On the other hand, I enjoyed the tender beef and succulent seafood since I do not eat lamb. Oh Well, You can't win them all.
5
Ambience is great for a family lunch! Not too big thus there are not many diners and you can have your food and conversation at the same time!Great service by the staff. The food, though not as expansive as some buffets, are of great quality and definitely worth coming again!Must try: the crepe...made to order. and the various other dessert availabl
4
Pleasant environment and not too crowded. Food quality & variety is ok. Price is slightly on the high side.Overall value for money
5
We had buffet lunch. The buffet spread is not as extensive as some hotels but food quality is really great! Love the spicy prawn noodles, barramundi, ham, duck porridge etc. Service is great! Staff well trained and friendly. Will definitely go back agai
2
A great all-round hotel, badly let down by the buffet, especially the breakfast. The selection is very limited, I would go as far as saying that it lowers the standard of the hotel. Management needs to make a call on this restaurant, either revamp it and bring into line with properties of similar standing or scrap it. Sadly, the buffet could be the deal breaker when deciding on which hotel to stay
2
Had the buffet here many times over the last few years. Main reason I wanted to return back to 10@Claymore was their sampling menu which they offered alongside the buffet dinner. Really wanted their Penang Laska. Also wanted to sample their Epicurean Treasures promo which featured Jamón Ibérico, Belon Oysters. However was informed by the service staff that they had discontinued the menu. Overall the epicurean experience really didn't live upto the name. Jamon hmmm was ok. Would have assumed they would have more delights available from that region. The buffet spread was very limited. If u didn't like some of the main dishes then there was little choice to choose good alternatives. The quality of food really lacked taste. Comparing Buffets 10@Claymore fell far below standards and value compared to all time favorites such as Basilico, Carousel and Oscars. Paid $80 nett per person.
3
I love that the place was not crowded or noisy. But that could also be why the spread was very little and they seemed a little short handed with the chefs on hand to serve the food. Food taste was ok, but the best things were only the fresh prawns and laksa.
5
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to your excellent crew and good variety buffet at 10 at Claymore yesterday.I hosted 80 guests to celebrate my grand daughter, Kyra's 3months old debut party. We had exceptional service from Margaret who referred me to Liliane, the F&B manager to organize the party. On the actual day, thanks to Gana, restaurant manager who assisted in organising a small table for balloons decor, chef Patrick and team preparing a sumptuous buffet lunch for my guests who raved about the yummilicious laksa, ham, satay and crepe. Last but not least, the affable Azarul (service staff) who went round to serve wine to all my guests.All in all, my guests had a great time and thank you for making my grand daughter debut party a great success. I will not hesitate to recommend your restaurant to my friends and business associates 
5
I wish to how express how impressed we were with your excellent crew and the value-for-money buffet dinner we had at 10 at Claymore 2 weeks ago. The lobsters, kikorangi cheese and the meats were very good! We had exceptional service from the wait staff and personal attention from one of the young chefs, Chef Koay Wee Hong who went the extra mile to check with guests if they were happy and making sure everything ran smoothly. This young man was very courteous, knowledgeable and showed a lot of pride in his work. He definitely is a keeper!Till to date, we are still talking about it. I will not hesitate to recommend your restaurant to my friends and business associates 
4
Spread is not as wide as other more extravagant buffets, but we liked that they kept it to a tight selection of dishes and cuisines to keep the quality up. Like the other diners, my wife and I were going for 3-4 rounds of the same few dishes. Overall, good value for the price
3
I definitely had better buffet compared to this. Food was really average. Nothing exciting, nothing special. Really limited in terms of variety
4
Just visited this nice restaurant with my family for the buffet dinner. The buffet spread is good & dishes are fresh especially the oysters. The crepe station is particularly popular where you can have your pick on what to put in. The price is reasonably good & there is parking redemption. Overall, value for money, albeit the staff could be more proactive in clearing the used plates.
5
One of the thing we wanted to try was all the different food which we did, all we tried was excellent. give the local food ago
5
The buffet spread was good, waiter service was attentive and the ambience was relaxing. Despite the place being crowded on a weekday, the overall dining experience was still an enjoyable one
3
Thought it was overhyped when they announced fully booked weeks ahead etc. The dining capacity is not big to begin with. 3 pax was given the same table size for 2 pax, and there are 2 empty tables just right beside us throughout our 3 hrs there. Would say the dishes are quite typical buffet dishes. Was a beef and oyster theme. The beef was good but I thought the oysters were so small.... Cold lobster were OK, but the fry lobster claws sauce was good, buttery and garlicky! Would not visit again....
5
We got to the hotel after a long flight and decided to eat in. What a wonderful start to our 3 day stopover in Singapore. The buffet is first class with an outstanding selection of seafoods, meats, pastries and desserts - local and international dishes. The oysters were among the best I've ever eaten. Higly recommended
4
Great options for breakfast catering to both local cuisine and international flavour. Fresh juices, blended juices, cereals, fresh fruit, breads, hot food and Asian mix. All up a great range and good tast food.Service was friendly if a little slow sometimes to get seated.
5
Good quality food & very good service. The buffet is value for $. My favorite buffet.I will go back for it again
5
Thank you, Liliane, Chef Anson and Team for the sumptuous lunch this afternoon.Your hospitality has gone beyond expectation my family and grand children feel so pampered and enjoy the delicious food so much that we can't wait to come back soon
3
Choose from three types of oysters which will be shucked on the spot. Enjoyed the freshly made crepes. Other than these, the other selections were quite ordinary.
4
Nice food but slightly pricey. Overall experience is great this time. The previous round I was there, they were severely understaffed, affecting service speed
5
The dinner here have not failed me even after five visits over the last three years. Excellent! will definitely visit again
3
We were excited and looking forward to Beef and Reef, and expecting a wide variety of beef... unfortunately it wasnt as expected. Only 1 Wagyu beef dish, which is tough. Oysters are ok, lobsters are average
4
I used the Ladyironchef promo code and got to dine at $98++ for 2 persons. AmbienceI like the dark and classy ambience. I enjoyed the setting. Variety The variety was a lot wider than I had expected. 3 types of fresh oysters 2-3 types of lobsters Wagyu beef Salmon sashimi and tuna sashimiBaked Norwegian salmon Freshly made dessert crepe Local food - fried oyster omelette, prawn noodles soup , laksa and etc Salad and fruits Peranakan and western dessert Ice cream Chocolate fondue Freshly-made Coffee TWG tea bagsQuality of Food The spread was generous. The oysters were freshly shucked from the shell. They were fresh but a tad salty. As for the Wagyu beef, it might be ribeye beef but it was cooked more like roast beef than a nicely charred steak I would have expected from Jack's Place or Bedrock Grill. The Wagyu beef was below my expectation. The sashimi was very fresh, thickly sliced and totally delicious. The garlic butter sauce for the lobster was tasty but the sauce was only just coated around the shell. After de-shelling, I could not taste the garlic butter sauce on the lobster flesh. I had wanted to scoop up more sauce from the pot but there was no ladle provided. That was a letdown. Service and Hospitality The staffs were the gem! 2 thumbs up! My Son observed that a Chef was multi-tasking effectively. That particular Chef was manning the Wagyu beef, shucking the oysters and cooling the dessert Crepe. I interacted with the Crepe Chef. He was very patient and listened to my request attentively. He did it all with a big, wide smile. My used plates and cutleries were cleared promptly, whenever I stepped out to get more food. Each time I was back, my used plates were cleared. They are that efficient and effective. Another staff took the initiative to ask if I need a complimentary car park coupon. I was impressed once again. I would say that the staffs work as a team to provide a all - rounded quality service and hospitality to the guests. I would say that first the awesome service and second the delicious food are the two factors that made 10 At Claymore top notch. Kudos to you ! 
4
Been here multiple times for lunch and dinner. Prices are in line or slightly lower than most other competing hotel buffets. The spread here is slightly smaller than most but quality of the dishes is generally high and the slightly hidden location ensures smaller crowds.
5
Great spread of food at 10@claymore. Oysters were the highlight for me - succulent and delicious. Will definitely return
5
First time to Pan pacific claymore. Car park location is a mystery (it is at the back). But the hotel staff is more than make up for this small inconvenient. It is a great value for money buffet, food (lobster, oyster, etc) is replenished quickly and plates are clearly swiftly. I have some guests fr overseas and staff make small conversation to make them feel very welcome (e.g. Invite them to try a durian pancake), I think that is a very nice gesture!
2
Informed the staff that cold crab ran out at 9pm, and staff promised to inform the chef to refill. Infromed the same staff again at 9:30pm when no refill came and again the staff reassured that it will be refilled soon. If staff told us that they ran our of cold crab then we would have left early but we waited on her assurance and the promise was not kept. This is not good. Disappointed that nothing happened, went to pay at the counter at 9:50pm. Asked for a customer feedback form and was told that there is none. Counter Staff replied that we can go to Trip Advisor to give our feedback. Another disppointment was that we were charged the full price despite making reservation through Chope which states 2 pax at $98++. Staff mentioned that it was not stated in the computer screen. She however offered us a 25% discount since we booked through Chope. Huh?? We also mentioned to her our disappointment on the cold crab not refilled despite two assurances. No apologies, just the usual "I will inform the chef". Staff were polite throughout though they completely miss the point of customer service when they did not address our issues. Will definitely stay away from this place until they get their act together

I went for the dinner buffet on 26th July together with my family. Food was alright, however the Wagyu tasted bad. The oysters were good. the crab pincers was also tasty.However, the service provided is of an unsatisfactory level. Since the buffet hours is until 10.30pm, I came at a later. But, at 9pm, they were no more seafood and none was served anymore. And also staff were busy packing and Keeping the food.I had approached the counter staff thrice to ask if anymore seafood would be served. First, at 9pm, and the staff told me that the seafood would still be served. I waited till 9.30pm and still none were served, so I approached the staff again, and she told me that she has spoken to the Chef and it would be served. Once again, I waited till 9.45pm and still there were none. And so I informed the staff again. However, until I left, there was still no seafood served or any action taken despite informing them on this.This is outrageous as the staff had not taken any action, and also had wasted my time waiting and had lied that there were still going to be seafood served.Also, how is this a buffet, if by 9pm, no more food is refilled?Will not recommend others to visit this place as despite paying for premium, the food and the service is ridiculous
5
Waitress were attentive and service was good. Food wise, fresh and tasty. The crepe station was pretty crowded and the filling was averaged esp durian. Nevertheless, we enjoyed ourselves
3
Was here when we held a farewell party to colleague. I would say, the foods just taste OK, nothing impressive. But it has a good-quiet ambience though
3
Went on Sat night for their Wagyu, Oysters n Lobsters theme. The tomahawk was tender, but unfortunately does not have that 'buttery' taste of wagyu. Enjoyed both the oysters, esp the creamier canadian ones, and the lobsters. As there is no more plates of pleasure, the spread is smaller than before. Having a small menu of ala carte dishes to order from is different from having those dishes placed in the buffet line.Previously, there is also a variety of gryphon teas, with more uncommon flavours, for sampling, but its now just the run of the mill TWG teas. Not saying that TWG teas are inferior, but previously the fun is in sampling the different flavours. Chefs manning the various stations are friendly. Overall, i still enjoyed my dinner, just not as before
4
Went for Sun dinner after seeing the lobster and tomahawk steak promotionPlace was cosy but not so big so the spread of food was just okSteak was good but lobster was not that fresh..
5
I go there by hasard, and i'm stay surprise for this Buffet..Good Services, Good Working peoples, Good Food and more choice..Price correct for this presentation..i come back Next week .. thank
3
The selection for the weekend high tea is not that appealing from my opinion.There were not much variety to the savoury and dimsum dishes. Dessert were ok but not that fantastic. Service is attentive though
3
3 dine and 2 pay deal. there for a birthday treat.they have oysters from 4 diff areas. Canada, USA, France and Ireland- oysters are all fresh. Good.I liked the Canada ones. they are "fatter" and "sweeter".cold section :prawns were fresh, lobsters fresh too but i feel they were abit tough.warm section :beef, lamb, chicken and pork ribs all dry and tough.salmon was abit dry esp at the edgesfried kuey tiao averagecoconut rice averagechilli lobsters: sauce too sweetblack pepper one was nice salmon and tuna sashimi were fresh.dessert: they have crepes, ice cream etc. quite a wide selectionsthey have a small bread and cheeses sections and teas/coffeesOverall if u love oystersssss.... and can eat lots of them to worth the $. per pax $80 after taxes...go for it... because the warm food section is very average.Service was efficient and good.friend wanted chamomile tea. they didnt have but they sent one later. i guessing they fetched from some where
4
I visited for the Oyster and Lobster Occasions dinner buffet that runs for a about 3 months every year. For this year, it ends on 30 Jun.The oysters were obviously the highlight of the buffet, although there were only 4 of 5 types when we visited. The experience of trying 4 different types of oysters side by side was amazing - definitely prefer the Canadian/US ones which were plump and juicy over the Irish (bleagh). The rest of the food was properly mid-tier, although the selection is more limited that what you might expect from comparable hotels. For the promotion price paid SGD49 +taxes (you need to quote a promotion for this), it is still priced fairly well.However, the restaurant seems severely shorthanded. Used plates and cutlery were cleared very slowly and it seems as though there were only two cleaning staff available.A few points I hope the management can consider:(1) Oysters should be freshly shucked – dead oysters left out in the open can become dangerous for consumption. This was a problem at some point after 9pm when the stations became unmanned and oysters were just pre-shucked and left on the counter.(2) The bowl of lemon water on every table should be replaced at regular intervals as repeated usage makes the water look chalky and nasty – no one replaced ours in over 3 hours.(3) It appears that all tables had the drinking glasses pre-filled with water even before customers came. This is not good practice. For hygiene reasons, drinking water should only when/after customers are seated(4) Unless absolutely necessary, do not give the customer the bill without being asked, 45 minutes before closing. It does not leave a good impression.(5) The serving staff seem to be doubling as the cleaning staff after about 9pm – again, more evidence of short-handedness?I hope that this feedback is taken seriously into account – they all clearly relate to a manpower shortage. The food was as good as can be and I have no further comment
4
The buffet spread is decent for the price. Oyster lovers will probably like this place. Seafood was fresh, but the lobsters are quickly cleared by hungry diners. I think the crab pincers were the best. Dining atmosphere is okay. There's not much privacy because the adjacent tables were too close for comfort.Service is excellent. Worth another trip down
4
Four oyster selection, allowed to take 5 each time. Oysters were very fresh. Cold dish lobster was served not properly thawed yet still slightly frozen with ice. Cooked lobsters were ok. Durian crepe was great.
5
The Chef was great and very proactive . He was very friendly and offered many varieties of dishes . The Place is amazing and spread of Buffet is good .
3
Had a nice Sunday morning buffet breakfast with my Wife. The spread was not as wide as other hotel buffet breakfasts I have been to but was still reasonably priced.
5
The Food is fresh and they are well flavoured. The Service of kitchen sraff are efficient and they are attentive. The service staff are very friendly, and they are also very attentive and prompt. It was an excellent dining experience.
3
We must have come on an off night (it was Tuesday). Average choice, average quality. For anyone giving this a 5 get yourself down to the Ritz Carlton or the other Pan Pacific to compare. Not a patch
4
Food was good multiple choices and variety from seafood to all kind and dessert. Specially the choices of fresh oysters from different countrie
3
It was an average buffet spread but given the price, it was not too bad. Generally, if you are keen on local food like prawn noodles, bak kut teh, assam laksa, satay etc, then you can't go wrong. But if you are just focused on just their local food then it would not be worth paying so muc
5
Great choice of food and good service. Will definitely return. I especially like that the oysters were shucked on the spot
5
We wanted some quality without too much expense and we ended up with our own 9 course meal!! This place is already highly rated and we were very lucky to get in walking off the street as it is booked out for months.TIP - take an Amex as you also get a 20% discount. Bonus at end of meal when you go to pay!!! We had no idea so very grateful to staff who mentioned it.Course 1 - sashimiCourse 2 - Penang assam laksa for me (m) & prawn noodle broth for my partner (p)Course 3 - LobsterCourse 4 - Chilli crab clawCourse 5 - Char Kway TeowCourse 6 - Lamb (m) and chicken (p)Course 7 - Eye Fillet with vegetables and gravyCourse 8 - Bread & butter pudding (m) & crepes (p)Course 9 - Dessert medley and frui
4
Staff working at 10 at Claymore are superb. They were helpful and courteous. Selection of food was not bad at all
5
Nice restaurant with excellent service. Service crew were always smiling and plates were cleared quickly. The Penang sections were great and authentic. They had a good spread of seafood items which is a big plus. Some items had too much salt, though.
3
Penang food standard not high but the chaupcai is good, vinegar pork is traditional good. Good lobster but always low supply.Oyster omelettes is worst i ever ate, done by unknown chef. Dessert never replenish just because not much customer. Disappointed.
4
Excellent value on credit card 30% discount for the Oysters & lobsters promotional buffet this month. Oysters from Australia, France, USA & Canada all shuck on the spot for you. Most evenings are fully booked so you can expect quite a crowd and queue for the Oysters and a rather cramped space to dine. Staff service is however very attentive and quick. Options for various types of coffee and tea are also available. Variety of food is not plentiful but the focus is really the Oysters and lobsters. No sushi but sashimi is available
5
My family enjoyed the dining very much. Food was good especially the oysters, lobsters, crepes and sashimi
4
The Coffee that came with the buffet were like Starbucks quality. . .I really did enjoy the Lobsters.Just a pity they did not have fluffy white rice with the buffet although one staff offered to cook some for me,Now . . . thatâ€™s good service.The restaurant manager though; did not seem too happy we changed seats nearer to the coffee machineI hope this review help
5
You don't need a huge spread but what you want is quality selection of food which is exactly what 10 at Claymore offers. On top of that, the service is exceptional. I'll be coming back again
5
Chose the bountiful buffet, or order from the menu. Either way, you'll be delighted. There's always fresh fish, including an assortment of lobster, crab, oysters, and sashimi
4
Hubs and I enjoyed the buffet mainly because of the excellent service that we experienced from the moment we were greeted at the entrance of the restaurant which is such a refreshing change from the usual sullen faces of service staff. All through the evening, our requests were met with smiles and swift action.The buffet was ok - not outstanding - but ok and focused on oysters and lobsters plus they had Penang food dishes. The oysters were excellent and the real star of the show. The lobsters were small and were cooked in a variety of ways. The sashimi counter was another winner. For dessert, I had the durian crepe and bread & butter pudding, both were quite good. Do save space for sweets as the dessert offering is quite extensive. Oh, and do remember to ask for a carpark coupon - which they handed out quite happily.
3
If you like oysters and more oysters, soft tender beef, lamb that is so awesome, this is the right place. There is currently some promo ongoing, you can try their penang cuisines, lobsters (not really their best, abit tough), crepes & chendol. I would just stuff myself with only the beef & Oysters. The waiter is very attentive, he is friendly & clear your plates pretty fast
4
went there purely for the oysters n lobster fest...not very exp...food spread not really alot but the quality n objective is there... the oysters are fresh n more than 1 type to choose from. theres durian crepe as well. will go again
4
Good service. Spread was okay. Oysters were very fresh. Came here for one for one deal! Good deal. Should try !

10 at Claymore is a restaurant to avoid, the location in the foyer at the Pan Pacific Orchard hotel, which is, for my wife and I, one of our favourite hotel retreats when in Singapore. We have been holidaying in Singapore for more than 20 years and prior to my retirement I have been involved in the tourism industry, in sales, accommodation, and administration.The food, what there was of it, was mostly just warm to cold and hard to find. The service, 3 guys looking after some 100 plus diners, on at a guess, 30 plus tables. We just felt we must have been invisible, even though we had a table almost in the middle of the dining area. We stayed for just over an hour and left as we were ignored to the extent that waiter service at our table was non existent. This was to have been a birthday dinner celebration. It will not affect our choice of hotel stays at the Pan Pacific Orchard where we choose to stay at lease twice a year, However, we will make it known to the senior staff at the hotel, the restaurant needs to take a real hard look at its management strategy
5
Food was fresh and fantastic, staff were swift, passionate and attentive, great setup ^^ Great variety too :
1
Was there for birthday celebration. Supposingly the seafood spread comprised of crabs, crayfish, lobsters etc but the queue to get these was long, and the rate the crabs and crayfish were replenished was very slow. All the guests had to stand in queue for about 10 mins before the refill took place which was quite unsightly and embarassing.Verdict for the night - everyone would rather head to The Line or Carousel the next round
4
As all buffets go, some food items were definitely better than others. My boyfriend and I went for the Oyster Occasion buffet dinner. There were Oysters from five different countries and also a fresh seafood bar. Great food: - Oysters (of course)- slow roasted beef- the curry leaf slipper lobster - assam laksa - lemongrass ginger ice cream - crepe station - char kueh teowThe rest of the food was so so or needed improvement. Shout out to one of the waitresses (can't remember if her name was falini or falni) who helped me get the chilli sauce for the oyster omelette, thanks so much for the help!
5
The seafood was better than expected, very nice with the oyster buffet. Also there was a very nice winelist
5
Wonderful family relaxing hotel with amazing food, wonderful breakfast and kind attentive staff. Book with confidence!!
5
Nice place to hold family gathering as the place offers a quiet environment. The staffs are friendly, proactive and hospitable. Their buffet spread can cater for every individual liking. Their head Chef Andy make everyone feel so comfort, welcome and enjoyable
4
My wife and I had the dinner buffet and were impressed with the wide selection and quality of the food on offer. You could choose between Asian, seafood, western, fruit and dessert. The only bad side was the price when it came to pay the bill. I was surprised by how much it actually was.
4
Awesome and Authentic Penang Food! Was there last weekend for friends birthday lunch celebration, we all love it, especially the cha kway teow, black vinegar pig trotter and durian crepes! Double thumbs up! Excellent service from Chef Andy Oh, Chef Eric and the rest of the service team too.
4
Stayed with my daughter (16) and loved the friendly staff. Breakfast buffet was awesome and the pool (mineral) was nice. Geared more for adult/business travelers than familie
2
Has breakfast here daily. Limited options, same stuff daily and not a great start to a morning. There is too much of oriental stuff and limited Asian and European options. ANd the worst part is that inspite of spending 10 nights thet never had dimsums on a single day
5
I was at 10 at claymore dinner with my friend. There a good spread for the buffet and food was fresh and tasty. All here chef will very friendly 
5
with the new season starting, the penang food was great. starting chef kelvin at the oyster station, chef eric and andy at the noodle and beef station, we were in safe hands. The laksa has a balance in taste of sourness and sweetness from the pinapple. service from staff were great, namely rosmawati, liliane, tara, ashraf, kim and tris. It was efficient and were ready to help, yet not intrusive.Overall a very good dinner, and i would definately recommend 10@Claymore to friends and family.

Another disappointing dinner after "The Melt ". Very limited spread only 2 types of sashimi not even have tuna or squid/octopus as usually i got 3 basic types. Seafood on ice never have queen roe scallops as picture shown. Also have 3 miserable types of cheese only and the pastries was not tempting as well looks cheap! What u see is not what u get.There are missing items obviously. Without the Plates of Pleasure and Oyster Occasion overall to me is just over rated as a Top 10 buffet
3
Given that it was a buffet priced at $68++, we were expecting a bigger spread of food. There was about 10-12 food warmer of food including its signature char kuay teow which was kind of cold. There was a small selection of seafood and oysters with a sashimi counter serving 2-3 types of sashimi.
5
The service and food everything was very good. Food was also amazing and delicious. its buffet so can eat till you are damn full. Will go agai
5
find this restoran when breakfast from hotel. so many variaties menu inside. Until i confuse which one first. if u stay in this hotel u should bought with breakfast menu. one my favorite pancake with nutella inside
4
Food taste alright. $58++ for 2. Good number of selections. Chocolate fondue, live station for beef steak, laksa. Went on weekends, not pack. Just 1 note, Parking fees for 1st hour is $5.
5
The outlook may looks rundown, but the buffet quality is fantastic. Best buffet I ever tried. The service is fantastic as well, plates are cleared very fast.One improvement might be on the ice cream, more flavours should be introduced, such as dark chocolate

Quick reservation over the phoneCozy ambianceFresh OystersWide variety of foodMostly delicious except the cakes which are so s

This was our first visit at this buffet restaurant for family of 5. Nice, spacious and not crowded. It has invited media for food tasting on the night we visited. We asked for loh hei dish and was soon served with it with salmon by staff crew named Daniel who was friendly. There were fresh oysters from 4 different countries. We tried those fr the US as recommended by the chef, however, they were not as fresh as we would love. Other cooked dishes were pretty nice, many CNY dishes brought out the festive mood. A nice dinning experience overall.
3
CNY special dish, lotus rice is really fragrant and I had 2 servings of it. However, the selection of food is not as extensive as expected. Very minimum sighting of whatever CNY special dishes as listed. The complimentary Yu sheng is not served. The replenishment of seafood is slow. Greens are super limited as well, only Luo Han vegetables can be seen. The birthday cake is served with lighted candle even though the birthday boy is not at the table. How awesome can this be. The only consolation is the service of the female manager who offer to get us coffee when we asked about the beverage station.
4
Best to make reservation either for lunch or dinner. Although pricey but surely worth it. There was a good spread for the buffet, especially those freshly oysters from different countries to select. Quality of each dish definitely tasty. Best is seafood corner. Desserts still average good. There is a nice chef walking around to concern about the guests. Overall, its a pleasant dining for buffet time
5
Good service with a good choice of food on the Christmas table. Crowd was manageable and tables were spaced well apart
5
I was at 10 @ claymore for pre-Christmas dinner with my friends last December. There was a good spread for the buffet and the food was fresh. The staff were friendly and attentive. Thank you to Daniel for helping to give my friend a surprise with the birthday cake and also the photo-taking. All in all, it was a very enjoyable and 'food'-filling evening
5
10 Claymore have an amazing spread and great food. New Year offer was festive, quite pricey but worth it.
5
We had a really nice dinner here with the oyster promotion which had freshly shucked oysters from 5 countries. The CNY items were also nice and the food on the whole was great. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.
5
We arrived in Singapore at 6am and since nothing was open except for hotel breakfast, 10 at Claymore was an excellent choice. It hits the spot after days end of foreign food. I quickly went for the DIY chicken noodle soup and dimsum (simple joys really but truly comforting when you've been away from Singapore food for x days). There was the usual breakfast array too: ham, bacon, fresh bread, cheese, etc. and they were all good.
5
If you are fresh Oyster lover, you must visit and try it. There are 3 types Oyster from US, Canada and Australia. It's first buffet restaurant to serve 3 different oysters in Singapore. I will definitely come back for it.
5
This is definitely a favourite with my family. Even though the spread of the buffet may not be the biggest, it is the quality of the food keeps us going back. There is always something for everyone. The star dish has to be the Penang char kuey teow. Besides the food, the service staff also make the dining experience more pleasant. The executive chef, Andy, personally checks on the food and also goes round to ensure that diners are happy with the food
4
There were 5 types of Oysters and Lobster at the dinner buffet at good value! Oysters were very fresh! Yummy! But I have to say only the seafood and cendol (with ice cream) impressed me. Most of the other hot items and desserts were just average or below
5
Went there for dinner with my partner, not a big spread buffet, but all the dishes are delicate.The Penang Char Kuay Teow, pig trotter with vinegar and durian crepe are remarkable. Serve with TWG tea, really reasonable price.Special thanks to Chef Andy Oh, professional cooking skills and very helpful.Thank you
5
This is the 4 or 5 time back to this restaurant,the food still maintain very well.And today the executive chef Andy was here when buffet start he was at the beef station.suddenly he walk over and offer me and my girlfriend some food.So surprise he offer me one bowl of traditional penang style of koay teow and a bowl of braised pork leg in vinegar that was super nice
5
Went there for a buffet in December. The penang food such as kway teow, assam laksa, prawn noodles tasted liked those I tasted in Malaysia. The chef had done a good job in making those penang food taste just like the original. The pork rib was very juicy. The desserts such as cakes were not too sweet. In fact all the food were very tasty to my liking.For the drinks section, there were different flavours of juices available. There were TWG tea to go with the desserts.Staff were very attentive and helpful. This is the best buffet we have tasted so far. Will come back another time for the buffet
5
Had a pre xmas celebration with a group.of friends. Nice food and great staff especially Ms Rosewati who made us feel much at home. Even gave us a beautiful log cake to end of our celebration!
Thanks!
5
Christmas lunch with colleagues, I most favorite food was durian crepe! Will go there again with my family
5
I especially like the Beef Rendang. Food selection is good, and the restaurant is clean and does not possess any overpowering smell (which can be a concern for some guests)
4
Visited 10 Claymore to get a bit of contrast as we had been enjoying Street Food for lunch and dinner the past few days. We did arrive a bit late in the evening and some of the dishes had noticeably been sitting out for some time. Their seafood selection was superb. Enjoyed Lobster after freshly made Laksa. Then choose New Zealand oysters from a selection of 4 different oysters available. Went back for more oysters as they were amazing and fresh. Then some freshly sliced sashimi which was as good. Finished off with some of their desserts which were delicious as well. Especially their chocolate based desserts. 98SGD for 2 people for the buffet was good for the selection on offer. The drinks were a bit pricey though
4
Meal: The oysters from USA, Canada, France, Australia, and Ireland; the beef sirloin freshly seared as you order, the free-flow of lobsters, prawns, and crab; the braised oxtail which I personally fell in love with; and lastly, the brewed coffee and TWG tea are worth mentioningAtmosphere: The dining space is just right; perhaps the lighting can be improved though as it was a tad dim during dinner serviceService: Attentive, courteous, and just right for a busy buffet service. Thank you very muc
5
I had a good experience in this restaurant. The restaurant have a good spread of seafood. Lobster claw, clam, oysters and etc. The service was great, efficient and fast. Special thanks to Daniel, who takes care of every guest needs and wants. He even gave a delicious birthday cake for my Grandmother. Thank you
5
Oyster galore from 5 diff countries !!!! Lobsters, Angus beef-topped with the Red wine sauce.Desserts were also a delight.The classy ambiance, courteous n helpful chefs. Final verdict - worth every single penny !!
5
Had a business meal here and I must say wow. The restaurant's Executive Chef Andy has won awards for his culinary skills and when you eat here you will know why.My clients were very happy. A must visit if in Singapore

So every year I will have a festive buffet dinner with my parents, as that is when I eat enough turkey to last me till the next Christmas. This year we decided to try out 10 at Claymore because we have tried Lime, Basilico, Hyatt and wanted somewhere new. I was a little apprehensive about 10 at Claymore as none of my friends have tried and the pricing was really reasonable. I must say the dinner was a pleasant surprise. Firstly, there were fresh Oysters from New Zealand, Ireland, France, Canada and USA. The chefs would open them for you and wow, they were as good as the ones I had at Borough Market in London. You had also all the other cold seafood - mussels, crayfish, crab, clams and 3 types of sashimi. For the carnivores like me, chefs would grill you steak and there was ham and turkey as well. The turkey could be better though but the rest of the food made up for it. The cooked food selection was alright but what tops it all is the service. No matter who came by your table they were always friendly and helpful. Special thanks to Mr. Gana for helping me arrange a surprise cake for my parents' anniversary and Kelly who was always serving with a smile. Will be back :)
5
Friendly and helpful staffs, great food and ambience. Thank you Chief Eric and Jasmine for the lovely service.
5
Must try!!!Chef Eric treat me and my family really kind and helpful. Thanks to him that make our dinner more perfectly
5
Nice food and service . Thanks to Chef Eric for the kindly assist and excellent service by him. My family really enjoy the dinner over there. Will definitely go back to enjoy the buffet again
5
Good food Good service best in singapore, we went with a family of 4. enjoy and has a good time. Thank
5
I went together with my boyfriend which was prepared in surprise by him. I generally enjoyed the dinner that was provided with extra credit to the cheese baked lobster that i was served. Made a good memory here and will never hesitate to come back agai
5
Went there by a recommendation of a friend and really enjoyed the food there. The staff was kind and the taste was excellent!
5
Have been to Singapore quite a few times and tonight has been one of the best meals. Service made it so. I had the Sashimi, oysters, lobster, clams, scallops, special noodle dish, braised ribs, marmite chicken, mushroom with Chinese greens, clams in garlic and cheeses to finish off... buffet, so as much as you want... I could only take small portions and couldn't make it to the beef grill or desserts! Great experience, highly recommended
5
Good place to eat oysters till you drop. 5 types of oysters and you can ask as many as like and staffs will open the oysters and happily handing them to you (unlike some buffet restaurants which actually limit the number of oysters each time you can get from the staff and also long queue). others seafood like lobsters and prawns are fresh too. The cook to order US beef is delicious.Very attentive and friendly service crewsSGD68 per head and with 30% discount with the credit card. Car parking fees is redeemable at the hotel. Really good value
4
Great hospitality by the service crew! Honoured to be served by executive head chef and amazing CKT
1
really, in this day and age no veggie option? How unimaginative do you have to be? Would not recommend it
3
Went here due to the grade giving by Tripadvisor as a good place for seafood in Singapore. 80 Singapore USD per person as buffet. Our first surprised was to see that the restaurant is inside a hotel. Place noisy and not such an excellent service from the waiters. Lack of the wines we selected and the food nothing special for the price given. Seafood was fresh and non Asian Oysters in the menu, but from France, Canada, New Zealand and USA. Regreat going there that night with family, having much other places in town to choose
3
As someone in the unforgiving F&B industry as well, I write this with a heavy heart. The restaurant is now a shadow of its glorious past. I have visited the restaurant regularly in the last 4-5 years and have seen the standards falter. Don't get me wrong, it is still a decent place for a buffet, it's just that things were much better in the past starting with the friendly and amicable wait staff. They took special notes of demands for birthdays and showed great care and concern for the diners. The straw that broke the camel's back is the removal of the "Plates of Pleasure" which was a defining feature of the buffet. The food was prepared and sent to your table and delightfully thought out portions. It is now reduced to just a couple of live station (only one meat station) and the signature char keay teow is cooked and placed in large batches in the hot food area rather than to order. Selections were also greatly reduced and there is no longer a carving section. Live stations are a great way to entertain the patrons in line with the open kitchen concept but it exposes cruelly any inadequacies in staffing or execution. Sadly that was the case, the station were at times not manned even while guests were queueing or crowding around the area. I do not fault the staff as there are always multiple demands in any commercial kitchen and I believe they are trying their best and maintaining the postiive vibe. I think it would make strategic sense to bring back the plates of pleasure and have it prepared in the kitchen and served to the table. This is after all what 10@Claymore has been about all these years. It is tough operating in the F&B industry where manpower issues always plague any operator. Perhaps a strategic rethinking of how to provide the best dining experience is warranted in this case.
5
They never fail to deliver. Excellent service and buffet spread. Their selection of oysters was fabulous. Had a great family dinner
4
We celebrated my brother's birthday at 10 Claymore and we really enjoyed ourselves! The food was really good! We love the steak, oysters and wide variety of food! Staff also provided excellent service! I would like to commend the duty manager, Daniel who was attentive and even went the extra mile to give my brother a birthday cake!
5
the 1st thing we had to mention is the executive chef, chef andy. a very cheerful and helpful head chef. from oyster to laksa to angus beef steak, he take the trouble to offer and suggest us. thank you very much, the server shin yie, good job and good hospitality. p/s, i was over heard one of the chef said that wearing slipper ask them to go out from the restaurant to another chef. sincerely apologize because normally we staying in the hotel also wearing slipper to the hotel's restaurant to having meal. beside the case overall we are enjoy! once again thanks to chef andy and shin yie.! good job
5
Hosted a 21st Birthday with closed family last Saturday. Spoil by choice with a wide range of variety of spread. Fresh oysters, lobsters, prawns and scallops. Must try their Lamb and beef too. Great ambience and hospitality especially Chef Andy and his team work tirelessly to ensure all dishes are replenished. We have a memorable evening and everyone enjoyed
5
Fresh and instant-opened oysters are available; besides oysters, other kind of seafood, like scallop and lobsters, are also available with good quality
4
Highlight would be the more than usual variety of oysters available for the buffet, overall variety of food types is average for the price paid. Would not really swing by again except if i would have friends staying at the hotel and probably feeling lazy to head out. Staff headcount seems to be pretty low, therefore leading to the feel that service levels feels sluggish during the dinner session i had
4
Catching the last Wednesday 2 pax for S$98 promotion during the Art of Omi month was one of the highlights of our week. The Omi Wagyu shabu shabu was fantastic with the melt in your mouth beef. The rest of the buffet spread was also good, with very fresh oysters, sashimi and other live seafood. The lighting was dim so my photos didn't turn out great, but the ambience and environment was cosy and welcoming. I was too full to try the desserts so I can't pass judgement, but the TWG teas were comforting. Would have liked some juice options though.
3
My husband and I travelled quite a way to this restaurant on the strength of the reviews...what a disappointment! Firstly, it is a restaurant attached to a hotel and thus on the pricey side. Secondly, it had as much ambience as the inside of railway waiting room. We sat with about 5 other guests expecting to be wowed because of what was said here. Sorry, it just never happened. Thing is, there are so many much better and far cheaper places than this in Singapore. Save yourself the journey and the money.
4
2nd time here. both times for their special buffet. prev time was oyster festival and this time is the omi beef special. both the oysters and beef did not disappoint except that it was too little!besides the main highlights, the other dishes on offer was really of quality as well. there is the lamb rack, cod, scallops, etc which were well cooked and really tasty. the beef counter where u order ur meat to ur level of preparedness also serve really decent quality of beef and accompanied by a pretty good sauce.above are the things i really enjoyed and it was really more than enough to fill u up real good. the sashimi and desserts though were nothing to boot about...less the crepe station which had lots of choices for the fillings.TWG tea is also available on requests. service standards is commendable as well. overall recommended and i would look forward to their next special buffet
5
We love going to this place. The wide selection of spread always excite and make us try it all :) if you love seafood this is the place to be! If not, don't worry! There are more alternative dishes too! One more thing to note is the standard of food here, i have to say one of the best place in singapore :) The chefs are more than willing to change the dish if the dish doesn't pass your discerning palate. Chef Andy really takes good care of this place. Service here are warm, very welcoming and very accommodating. We always enjoyed our time here
5
Usual family and friends eat our planning. Came to know that 10 @ Claymore is serving Omi Beef Shabu Shabu. Booked for 7 pax but I was told is full tonight. The staff was so kind to help to arrange a table at the lobby lounge for us. Bravo to the great service and flexibility. Arrived at 7pm, the whole Restaurant was packed. The hostess came up to us and greeted us. Sat us down in the comfort long table. Perfect for family. 5 types of oysters ranging from Ireland to France and Australia. Freshly shucked. Seafood and Maine lobster on Ice, sashimi, slow baked salmon. Perfect to start our meals. Omi Shabu Shabu was then served to our table. Light poached in stock and dipped in sauce. Perfect... Great mixes of western cuisine and Asian. Tender grilled lamp chops, char kwan teow, Penang Laksa and Prawn Mee. Never waste a single space of my stomach. Just love it... Special mention to Arjun... I think he is the manager who is on duty. Attentive and great service ( the restaurant is full)... keep up the good 10 @ Claymore. A restaurant that not to be missed.

When I got to Singpore, I've been searching the internet on where can I eat a good buffet meal. Read an article of the 10 top most and Pan pacific was first on the search list so at 2AM in the morning I sent an email (how inconsiderate of me). I saw that they are serving oysters among 5-6 variety. Having limited food to eat (allergies) I was so glad that eating a buffet meal will include the food that I'm not allergic. So had the reservation. They sent me back an email and called me on the day to confirm. My boyfriend flew in for a 2 day trip. We got to the hotel 15 minutes early. Daniel who was the receptionist assisted us to our table. And assisted us about the wine menu. Omni beef was REALLY REALLY GOOD. Not to mention (didn't get his name) so I will call HIM (the OYSTER CHEF EXPERT) when I went for my first plate of oyster, it was unbelievably GOOD, came back asking him (the EXPERT) about 2 taste that was very distinct to me. WOW he was soooo RIGHT, the most salty like oyster and the bitter nutty type, HE really knows IT. And as for my boyfriend's experience about Chef Andy, so worth mentioning, HE WAS so accommodating on what or how we can enjoy the wag yu and the lamb. And because my boyfriend doesn't know what to choose among the noodles, he told Chef Andy to surprise him, gave him the best taste of LAKSA, So amazing. My story doesn't end here. Because aside from the 2 who were named and of course my OYSTER CHEF EXPERT (sorry didn't know your name)! Madam and the all the other STAFF are really nice and the restaurant had a wonderful service. Overall will comeback again to 10 at claymore. And I truly recommend the experience. Thank you for Letting our night memorable
4
It was a pleasant and enjoyable birthday celebration at 10 at Claymore on Thursday, 8th September 2016 with my family. We choose Thursday so that we can enjoy our food in a less crowded ambience. We especially enjoyed the Shabu Shabu Omi Wagyu Beef and the fresh oysters. It was excellent. We had a surprised birthday cake too. The chocolate cake is so yummy. Overall, the food is of high quality and good service. I highly recommended 10 at Claymore. It is a good choice
5
All of us enjoyed the buffet (and 2 of them are from Germany). We had tasted the oyster from 3 different countries and all are fresh. Sashimi are yummy!Beef for shabu shabu is very delicious! Baby lobster free flow were fresh and tasty!The spread for desserts are excellent!Service was attentive and the coffee was nice.Overall, the dinner was a happy and joyful. Was feeling too full that we had to walk around ion orchard before heading home
4
Clean & nice place.Large choice of food.All tasted meals were delicious.Gentle & helpful Staff.We had a very good evening
5
This is My sister 4 times celebrating her birthday here at 10 at claymore. Chef Eric will always served us delicious food...thanks for ur awesome creme brulee. We really love the food and service here. Once again, thank you very much Chef Eric. We will be back soon.
4
Food selection here may not be the widest, but the food quality is one of the best. Fresh oysters, cod, salmon &one of the highlights has got to be OMI WAGYU! perfect marbling. Dessert spread was normal, but the durian crepe made upon request is awesome! super generous with the durian &it's bittersweet goodness
5
We celebrated a family birthday at the Saturday lunch buffet today and thoroughly enjoyed it! The service was good and all the staff were friendly. Gana was particularly helpful and attentive to my elderly mom who walks with a cane and who is hard of hearing. The sashimi was fantastic. The ham with pineapple sauce was festive and reminded me of Christmas. We had to indulge in second helpings of the signature bread pudding.... Will definitely recommend 10 at Claymore to colleagues and friends. Thank you
5
After reading all the reviews I thought I would give the buffet a try, and I was not disappointed. Fantastic spread of food, covering all tastes. Could have continually refilled my plate with the lobster and sushi if I wanted too, and even managed to eat my first oysters in c.15 years after a little cajoling from the chef - still don't understand the fascination!!! Certainly great value for money
3
Was here for friends gathering. Environment is cozy and comfortable. Service was polite and attentive. Cold foods like salmon, oyster, clam etc was fresh. They also served soup noodle, black pepper beef at the hot station. Salad, bread and hot dishes are of limited choices, vegetable are not fresh. Selection of desserts and fruits are just nice. Perhaps the guest volume are not so high thus by limiting the selection for cost effective and wastages. If you are UOB card holders you are entitled for 20% discount or with 4 paying adults you get to enjoy 1 diners free.
5
Excellent food especially the Char Kuay Teow, Pig Trotters, prawns noodle and many others. Impressed with the freshness and standards! Well done Chef Andy Oh! Good service provided by the resturant staff especially Gana. Will surely return with friends and business associates. Really enjoy my meal here
5
What can I say, it was excellent!!! Chef Eric and the whole team make the dinner experience awesome, would recommend it!!!!
5
I was introduced to this restaurant by a friend and did not regret eating here. The staff are friendly and helpful. Also, a special thanks to Ken who took time to show me around and introduced their specialities to me
1
Food is ordinary, nothing special, but not value for money. What kills the place is the service. Restaurant was half empty, waiters were very slow. People had to pile up dirty dishes on empty tables because waiters were not coming to pick them up. We ordered a Omi (a sort of hotpot) and they left it burning till the broth burnt, although we called them many times. I had to put it on another table since it started to smell.B-graded compared to many other buffet offers in town
5
Just had buffet dinner here and the food is wonderful, amazing standard for hotel buffet!! Oysters, wagyu, sashimi all fresh and even the normal hot mains were delicious! Crepe and beef station chef is really skilful and nailed the cooking! The cakes and breads could be improved though because it tasted a little too dry. Dessert spread could be more to end the night a sweeter one ;)Staffs there were all friendly and helpful, excellent service. Everyone of the staff served with a smiley and positive attitude, and offered their help/service without even us asking for it! Wonderful! Special shoutout to the staff Daniel who went out of his way to help us with our too fatty wagyu, kudos to his cheerful and professional attitude! Definitely be back for more! Love it
4
I would like to thank the hotel F&B manager for creating a memorable birthday celebration for our party of 10 people at such short notice. We were told that the buffet at 10 at Claymore seating was fully booked for a private function (to our dismay) but through the staff clever ingenuity, a very up-class make shift table was set up in the lounge area next to the enclosed buffet section. The lunch dining experience was up to expectation and value for money. Kudos to the staff for its attentiveness and going for that extra mile at such a short notice arrangement.
3
Unless you're really into oysters there's really not much else to gush about this buffet. The spread is limited and the cold seafood surprisingly quite bland and tasteless
4
Went for the buffet dinner on a Wednesday Night.There are a wide spread of very fresh Seafood! There are 5 different types of Oysters from different countries and all are fresh and fat ! The prawns are big and crunchy.The crabs and clayfish are fleshy and crunchy.The sashimi choices are limited, only 2 of the most popular types, namely Salmon and Maguro but they are very fresh! There is no point having many varieties yet not serving the best quality, so I believe they do feel the same.The mains consists of Penang Char Kway Teow, XO fried rice, Angus beef, Penang Prawn Noodle Soup and Penang Laksa. Personally, I like the Angus beef which are browned as slices, the chef brown it to your choice. This is something that is unlike other buffets, which are always pre-cooked in a slab and then sliced when you want it and is usually tough.They have foie gras too, but you have to order them from the waiter as they are not presented over the counters.They are very generous in the portion and you can order as much as you want. The foie gras are cooked to perfection!There is only a choice of vegetables but large variety of lettuces for you to DIY salad.The dessert counters are served with non that appealing cakes and puffs. There is only a type of cheesecake, mango cake, chocolate cake, cream puff and strawberry pudding. The fruits are fresh though.Last but not least, the service is great. The servers are very attentive.Will I return again? Yes definitely!
3
There ended up being a problem with our reservation and the restaurant was booked out. They went above and beyond to accommodate us and we were able to dine here. As mentioned the service was fantastic and could not be faulted. We all found the food to be very ordinary and the prawns had a funny flavour. Overall we did not enjoy this buffet and felt that it was very expensive. If you love seafood you may find it better value for money but if you are like me and only like a small amount of seafood I wouldn't bother
5
Was here for the promotion on oysters 1for1 dinner. We were well greeted and led to our table. The fresh seafoods, lobster , prawn were yummy. The special dishes like goose liver etc were small but great. Tender juicy good. We wanted a bottle of wine to go with. The staff was very helpful and responsive. Service level was great. The five oyster types were a great mixed- France, canada, aussie, NZ, usa. We enjoyed the place, the drink, the foods, the companies till the place was closed
4
We capitalised on a dinner promotion at this restaurant. It was a dinner buffet and was very crowded. There were queues for food at times, but the staff managed the partons' expectations well. In terms of buffet spread, it is not as varied as some other establishments that we had been to. However, the dishes were all done well and we particularly enjoyed the fresh oysters as well as the Asian spread.The restaurant was shorthanded that evening and there was only 1 server serving all the tables for the first half of the evening. Despite being the only server, the staff performed her duties well and professionally. I observed that she kept herself very composed and was polite in treating the guests at each table. I was particularly impressed by how she kept her cool and carefully noted down each table's request. It definitely wasn't easy with such a large crowd and this particular staff performed, in my opinion, beyond expectations.We enjoyed our dinner and will like to have the opportunity to patronize again in future
5
We missed the food so much that we had a family gathering few weeks ago,we were not disappointed, Chef Andy and his team were at the station serving us with the signature Penang Cha Kway Teow, Asam Laksa, Big Prawn Noodle.The Penang Rojak was our favourite, we were also pampered by the hospitality of Mr. Ganesan and Ken who made us felt most welcome! Especially the kids also enjoyed as much as the adults with endless food, we long to come again!Thank you Chef Andy and your team, Mr. Ganesan and Ken
5
Although very popular and booking essential, this restaurant can only be described as food heaven, the seafood platters are on a level rarely experienced and I highly recommend this establishment for a food experience that will be remembered for a a long time
1
Very disappointed on the reservation. Within days the reservation being taken for the entire promotion period. Which the hotel could maybe added 'fully booked' rather than promotional price which u can't get any seats anymore. Indeed the restaurant promotion is very attractive. However if is fully taken they shouldn't advertise anymore which give fake hope to the public
2
Let me start with, if you do not have a reservation be ready to set in a table at the hotel lobby, it is not bad at all. Then if you searched and searched so you can go to eat sea food, do not go there, however it is a not bad buffet with meat, pork, chicken and seafood. It is not cheap, do not set your hopes high because you will be disappointed, this location is near other cheaper options so do what you think you will enjoy the most
4
There's a little chef who will cook you up a treat and greet you with a smile every morning. A true asset to this venue
4
When called to make reservation, restaurant was fully booked but the lady taking bookings was kind enough to arrange for a table at the cafe area. HIghlight for this period was the 5 different oysters to choose from which is freshly shucked according to what you want. There is also a good selection of food that you can order for the day - we had a menu of lamb, baby back ribs, foei gras, char kway teow and also chendol (these took a long time to reach the table and are of small portions, so be warned of waiting time and do ask about serving size). Buffet wise, there is a great selection of at least 2 soup (assam laksa and prawn noodle) dishes, crepe, a sashimi station, chilled seafood, chef station to make steak according to how you like it, bread and cheese station, salads, soup, and hot dishes like satay, fried finger food, beef cheeks, lamb, and another table worth of fruits and desserts. Would like to shout out to Anjun that would take care of us even though we are seated far away. Slow service at the cafe area, but overall, the people working there really take care to make sure the food is of good quality with staff taking on extra roles to ensure people get fed (pastry chef shucking oysters!). also had a good selection of Gryphon tea to end the meal with! Worth the price, remember to make reservations early
5
Many kind variety of oyster ... Super value for money . Enjoying the plate pleasure foie gras , lamb of rack nicely done . Prawn noodle with tiger prawns and many variety of dessert selection too . My son really enjoying the durian crepes ...

The very good buffet restaurants is one of my favorite aspects of the food scene in Singapore. Given its substantial cost, this place provides very poor value. More specifically, I found the experience quite frustrating: the selection was rather limited, quite a few of the things were not well made, there was a very long line for the seafood, the service was quite poor (it took very long to get the servers' attention), and there were more issues, but you probably get the drift. Given that there are so many good buffets in Singapore, I see no reason to go to this place

We were there for the oysters buffet. Oysters came from USA, France, Canada, Australia and Ireland. The restaurant had a good crowd on the Sunday night but not that crowded that you had to queue for everything. The oysters were fresh and delicious. We also ate quite a bit from their chilled seafood variety. The durian crepe was yummy with generous durian puree. I noticed the chefs were skilled to handle the slicing of sashimi to the shucking of oysters to the cooking of laksa to the folding of crepe! Impressive! They were also quick to attend and patient with diners. The drinks section did seemed a little short-handed though. They have a good variety of gryphon tea to end the meal with. Definitely in my list of buffet dinners to return to

We ate at the restaurant many times,Food was really very nice and the setting was so pretty.Staff were so helpful and kind
4
Family and I went for small celebration. Food was good quality and service was impeccable. Rajeev was a stand out friendly guy and dished out great service. Chefs manning stations were friendly and interacted with guests well. One of the most pleasant buffet dinners I have had in a very long time. Oh the Penang delicacies and the Oysters were Yummy too!Will be back

I appreciated that there was a mini a la carte menu as part of the buffet plus a number of stations where chefs made other dishes on request. This meant that the majority of the meal was fresh and tasty. Food was generally very good quality. The dessert selection was excellent.Service was mostly attentive, but we did need to hunt down a drinks menu and waiter to order and our final order for the dessert from the mini menu did not arrive (and the restaurant was not at all busy in the night we were there).
5
We had a really good dinner there. Service was great too.Lobster, fresh French and USA oysters, steak, grilled lamb, swordfish sashimi, kuey paiti, Asam laksa, freshly made crepes with interesting ice cream flavours. These are just to name the few which we enjoyed. Parking at the hotel is free when you dine there. Conveniently located in Orchard Road
5
Dined on a table of 7 (and 2 kids) with my in laws at 10@Claymore for the buffet lunch and everything was truly superb; from the freshness of the sashimi to the tenderness of all the meats we ordered from the kitchen, along with the dishes at the live stations which were absolutely delicious. Special shoutout to the manager on duty; Salina, who was very accommodating- had a last minute request for birthday cakes (wife and father in law) and she appeared with 2 beautiful muffins within seconds. Had truly wonderful afternoon, will highly recommend the restaurant; buffet is real value for money with quality!

Great service by attentive waiters, especially Auyuan. Food well cooked and served at right temperature
5
sits in a quite street, 5 minutes walk to Orchard Road, Hotel staff is very friendly, from the Club floor to the resturan
5
This is our go to restaurant when we want to get our money's worth. This is our 6th time and we still haven't been let down. The food is something you will come back for and the staff is efficient. Rajeev will welcome you with a smile and will make sure you are well taken care of. He's the man
5
If you want to enjoy fresh seafood, exquisite dishes and yummy desserts, come here! You will not get disappointed. It was our 5th time. The staff is also wonderful! Look for Rajeev and he will accommodate you with warmth and thoughtfulness.
5
The food we ate were delicious and divine, the baked salmon was the one I like the most! The staffs were respectful and friendly and would like to point out Salina for her excellent customer service. Would highly recommended this place and would revisit this place in near future
5
This is one buffet where there is no compromise on quality. Every dish was delectable and prepared with attention to detail. In addition to the buffet items, there are plates of delight to order ala carte - the Penang char kway teow and Chendol are superb and must not be missed! Exec Chef Andy Oh brings the Penang authenticity to his dishes and these are among the very best that we've had. The ambience is comfortable and elegant. Service is impeccable - Kudos to Jeremy and his team
5
Wide range of breakfast suited to most nationalities. Great service. Staff extremely courteous. Spacious dining area.
4
Its very close to Orchard road where you have all the shops. If you love shopping you should stay here

Family outing and ate dinner at claymore . Plenty of good selection of food and delicious . Would definitely recommend to others and come back again .

Good food and atmosphere. Really delicious, a wide variety of food. Even had durian crepe! ( freshly plucked durian? Beef and lamb also freshly prepared, its realyl tastey as well. A little bit too dark the lighting i must say though , but not a main issue. Went with a group of bout 20 people. During that time, it was Penang food fare, i must say one of the best asam laksa, bak kut teh and prawn mee i have tasted in Singapore ( being a Malaysian myself and been to Penang multiple times). Only set back, 5 of us had diarrhoea on that night itself...and common factor was the oysters that all of us took, i think this is a serious matter the management team shud look into. Only consolation is that despite the multiple episodes of purging on few hrs after the dinner on that night itself, it resovles with symptomatic treatment and none of us required any hospitalsation. Am suspecting S.aureus infection btw..... Also, i left my tripod camera cover on that day, and none of the staff was able to locate it. Its my fault for being careless, but i guess it will had been a bonus if they could had seen or retrieve it. In conclusion, Would i return? hmm....doubt it due to the diarrhoea. Good food vs diarrhoea, u make the decision wisely

I visited the hotel restaurant for dinner with friends. I had the honor to speak to the executive chef. The food variety at a buffet is amazing ranging from oysters, sashimi and other seafood to dumplings, meat and vegetable dishes, noodles and ending with dessert table. I especially enjoyed signature kway teow which had a rich taste without oil and durian pancakes. Cheese lobsters and oysters were literary melting in the mouth. A must dining option in Singapore
5
we went for a family dinner and have had a wonderful evening over buffet dinner.The food is good and the price is reasonable. And most important of all, many thanks to Mr Rajeev's excellent service who made our night enjoyable
4
The waitresses and waiters was super friendly and was with all smiles, had a great night with my friends and the oysters are very fresh so were the sashimi. Love the varieties of teas that are being served which are just good for after meal, to soothe the bloatness of our tummy
5
This restaurant had an amazing buffet. Much delicious seafood and a fantastic dessert buffet. Its a little pricey, but its worth every dollar. The service was also very good!
4
The food is lovely and The waiters are Very kind...the music give you the possibility to talk with no problems...I Hope To come Back once again
3
We went to this place because it is rated #6 in tripadvisor and pics are really nice. In reality it is a regular buffet with wide choice of dishes (even with seafood), but quality/ taste of food is very average. Taking into account the price per buffet (80 S$), we were extremely disappointed to spend such amount of money here.
5
Food choices were excellent.Juices,fruit,cereals,pastries,toast,eggs of your choice,light & fluffy freshly cooked pancakes & many hot dishes such as dumplings,curry,rice
5
We went back to the restaurant sometime back for dinner buffet. The food was good, ingredients were fresh and have a reasonable variety. You know, the usuals. I must say its always good to see Jay again.He always makes us feel very welcomed.His service was amazing, always recommending which are the special items to go for. He was attentive down to every single details. He always recommends which tea is good to end the meal and it always makes my day. (The restaurant has a good selection of gryphon teas
5
Recently we had a birthday Lunch celebration at 10@Claymore, food and service was indeed excellent, right from the first step into the restaurant we were welcome warmly by Salina who took good care of my very elderly mother making sure that she was comfortably seated! Chef Andy and Jeremy pamper us with their culinary expertise in servingsuch an excellent spread! We had so much nice food and good service that we had to skip dinner! It was a well done job by the the Great Chef Andy, Jeremy and Salina and their team!We promised that we shall return for another celebration in this Restaurant
5
A few months back my family celebrated my dad's birthday and the service given by the staff was excellent we bought some longevity buns and ask the staff to serve later, so when it was served they actually heated it up for us first. he food variety was great we really had a great time there. Would recommend this to anyone and will also return for another mea
5
We got there thanxs to reviews from TripAdvisor, and when we got there, we were even more impressed! The seafood is so varied, unlimited, and fresh. The buffet features so many ítems and the desserts are also unbelievable! Would definitely reccomend the stop for this great buffet
5
Very good service by the staff, especially the manager Mr Rajeev. He paid very close attention to my family and I, and advised us as to the best options to take, and never once was there any poor service! Would definitely recommend to anyone
2
As we were staying in the hotel, we decided to eat here after reading the reviews.Table for 6 - buffet was excellent, great variety and unlimited.However, nobody came to ask us if we wanted drinks, so OK not too bad - asked one of the staff (possibly managerial but maybe not the manager) did we need to order at the bar. He said no, he could take the order so requested a wine menu. After 5 minutes it came to the table - 10 minutes later we ordered 2 glasses of wine - 2 cokes - 1 mojito.20 minutes later - still no drinks - member of staff we had ordered with was walking around checking with other guests at the tables, then proceeded to chat with one of his colleagues, at which point I left the table walked over and politely reminded him we were still waiting. 5 minutes later the wine and coke appeared but no mojito. All in all 40 minutes to receive drinks - when he brought them there was no apology - I made a point of saying that 40 minutes to get drinks was unacceptable at which point an apology was forthcoming, but Iets just say begrudgingly.So to summarise - food great but self service ( which we were aware of) - hotel great - attitude of this one particular staff member was appalling and spoilt the whole experience
5
We were able to get a table only about an hour before dinner. However the only available tables were in the hotel foyer. The food was great. The oysters were amazing. It's almost near impossible to try every dish. It is great food and very well priced for what you get.
4
Celebrated my dad's birthday here and the team went the extra mile in surprising us with a lovely birthday cake. Spread was decent, food was fresh and cooked to perfection. The team were also very pleasant and attentive to the guests requests.
5
Fantastic Foods!Fantastic Service!Fantastic Ambience!Fantastic date with my wife!A great thumb up to the Chefs and Service staff at 10@Claymore. The quality of food and the among of effort they present, it really worth the cost (See the photos). The service was excellent, especially from Manager Rajeev who is so thoughtful. When we were settling the bill, Mr Rajeev wants to ensure we had try the best, which is their New Zealand Lemongrass ice cream. Ohh... we almost miss it, so immediately he went to get it and serve it to us. The ice cream is really really nice and we really appreciate his service. I really recommend this place to everyone.
5
They serve french cuisines in this buffet. Must order the food from the " Plates of Pleasure ". My favourites are beef ribs, baby lamb shank, goose liver and scallops. Their oysters from US is succulent and juicy. Prawn from the pawn soup counter is delicious. Sashimi and cold dish are just ok - not that fantastic though they hv lobster. Environment is cosy and not too crowded today. Chairs are comfortable. Parking is complimentary if you spend $60 and above. You can redeem while settling the bill 
5
We visited from another hotel following a good review, would recommend especially if you have fussy eaters and want to try a mix of things. The staff were great, selection wonderful and the food was great (try the lemon grass ice cream), not to mention a great winner with the wonderful chocolate fountain which went down a treat with our son
5
A very good selection of fresh food, cold cuts and warm dishes. A delectable buffet that ranks with the finest 
5
Visited 10 at Claymore for my bf's birthday dinner. Everything was really fresh. Sashimi and oysters were only prepared upon request. The lobster was amazing. And mind you I do not like lobsters, but I had two whole lobsters that day. Steak was really good, tender and buttery. Would like if they had more fruit choices for the chocolate fondue
5
This is my first visit to this wonderful city of Singapore.The hotel is located in a quiet neighorhood just adjacent to the bustling Orchard Road.And I happened to be at 10@ Claymore for dinner.There was a huge attractive buffet but I decided to order à la carte although dessert was from the buffet.Buffet had a large selection of sea food,Meat and vegetarian dishes.The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters.I ordered vegetable Samosas.They were awesome to bite into along with the sweet dip.The main course was Indian Vegetable Platter. The dishes had the warmth of home-made food.The Kuih (Singaporean Dessert) and Lemongrass Ice cream were so good that I had to go and get a couple more servings to curb my sweet tooth.The food was delicious and of 6 star standard.Chef Eric's Crepe was super delicious.The restaurant is spacious and the atmosphere is very relaxing.The dinner arrangements were pristine.The service is relaxed, too, but it’s super attentive,along with the warm hospitality of the dining room: This is a restaurant that’s truly extraordinary.The friendly staff especially Rajeev,Jeremy,Ian,Chef Eric along with Salina who explained in detail what was on the buffet,gave me a great dining experience I shall not forget, meaning yes I'll revisit the restaurant in my future travels to Singapore and highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and business associates and to anyone out there who would like to experience great dining at mid price ranges.It's also a great place for business lunch/dinners.I work for a 6 star cruise line and have had my share of high profile restaurants around the world and this one is a must to visit if you happen to be in Singapore
4
great place to enjoy the buffet with a wide spread of food. Must try the oyster, crepe, prawn mee soup, beef..Nice chef to
5
The restaurant never fails to amaze me with its standard of cuisine along with the brilliant chef who cooks the best Penang Char Kway Teow I have ever had! This time, besides the wonderful buffet that I always enjoy, I happily indulged in the wide selection of cheese served during lunch. There was the usual creamy brie and soft camerbert, in addition there was this amazing cranberry cheese which had the perfect combination of sweet and savoury flavours together and the one that delighted me most was the chilli lime cheese which took me by surprise. It was slightly spicy, savoury and had a tinge of sour lime at the end. PERFECTION in every bite. I know that their cheese selection varies from day to day so I always hope to try new flavours each time I visit. I heard there's a porter cheese and some blue cheese on other days! I'll definitely be back for more
5
Only found this by checking out trip advisor. It was just around the corner from our hotel ! We were greeted by Rajeev who showed as the full buffet and offered suggestions We were thoroughly spoilt all evening as he suggested various dishes and then had them freshly cooked for us Huge thanks to him and the rest of the team for making our first night in Singapore very special
5
Had a lovely time with friends. Fresh sashimi,crabs and oysters-wow got choice of oysters from Ireland, Boston and Canada .Yummy. Best was the crispy crepe by Chef Eric Cheam. Top it up with lemongrass ice cream- and it was Wow
5
I've actually arrived at the restaurant early. One of the first few to be seated in the restaurant. Overall feel of the restaurant, certain part of the restaurant are brighter than the rest. I'm not really sure why. Table settings are clear cut, chic. Colors are well chosen. Cutleries are clean, no water marks what not. The moment we are seated down, the host explained that we could order some special dishes, that are not displayed- there was lamb shank, foie gras, beef short ribs, char kway teow etc. Food was served efficiently, I thought it was because of the beginning of dinner time. But they kept the efficiency of the serving through out the dinner time. The clearing of tables was quick as well. Food. I would say, 10@claymore, speaks and focus a lot on the quality of the food. They might not have the largest spread of all food. But the quality of food, not just in the ingredients, but the way the food is made, plated, served(might it be at the display or to the customer) it's been carefully thought through. I would like to specially mentioned the King Prawn Noodle Soup, the Durian Crèpe with Lemongrass Ice Cream, the Lychee Shortcake. Let me start with the King Prawn Noodle Soup. I'm quite hesitant about stalls that sells prawn noodle. The cornerstone of a Prawn noodle lies in its soup base. If the soup base is good, all will fall in line. Was blown away how good the Soup was, I could drink a few bowls of it! For those who don't like to de-shell the prawns, you could request the chef to do it for you! Lychee shortcake. If you're a dessert fanatic, and you've try the Lychee Martini Cake from Pine Garden. This is better than that. The fluffiness of the chiffon cake, that blends ever so well with the well-infuse lychee cream. You got to try it to believe it. Durian Crèpe with Lemongrass Icecream. According to my missus, it's the best she have ever tried. From the looks of the durian paste, is almost that it's taken straight from the seed! According to the manager Rajeeve, he said that in the whole Singapore, this is the only place that you can find Lemongrass ice cream. The gastronomical explosion between the durian and lemongrass, is to die for. I love the ambience and atmosphere. It's not too pushy. Love the way how the managers goes around and speak with the guests- that should be the way how hospitality is done. Before I left the place, I spoke to Rajeeve, and said that all I ask, is to keep the level of excellence towards service and Dedication towards quality of food.

We r very happy with both the waiters & chef's service during our visit . Thank you very much . We will sure to come back again n we will recommend more people to come 
5
Thanks to Chef Andy, Chef Eric, Mr Jay and their awesome team for a great evening with mouth watering foods and warmness service.Chef Eric...thanks for the honey lemons to smooth my throat and surprised by Mr Jay cos he had personally make hot chocolate for my friend's kid after when the little boy mentioned he is feeling cold (little boy wake up from his nap).Never have been disappointed. And not to forgetting Miss Kavitha, her sweet smile.Once again, thanks for the evening

Seafood focused buffet. Seafood was the thing they seem to know and have high quality with. Service was desperately slow. Waiters did not fix plates or fill-up glasses (water) despite requests. And they for sure were not in a hurry
3
Good variety of foods. Service for drinks and clearing was not as good as it should have been. Thought it was overpriced for the experience

As part of a Valentine's Day weekend I used trip advisor to help pick a couple of nice restaurants. I saw 10 at claymore was rated top 5 in Singapore and after reading customer comments booked a table for valentines day and final night on holiday dinner. Having now been and left massively disappointed I'd like to leave what I believe is a honest and fair review. Location - 1 starSome restaurants in singapore have stunning views of the Singapore skyline, marina bay sands, Singapore flyer etc. - this however is not one of those restaurants. 10 at claymore is located in a hotel lobby looking out to the taxi drop off point with passerby's looking in. Being able to hear screaming kids and loud guests from the hotel was not what I was expecting. Price - 1 star We paid for dinner $88++ which at the time I thought was acceptable given its high rating. I must confess that now I feel that I paid well over the top for an average buffet. Again, there are other restaurants in Singapore where you can find a nice dinner for less. Service - 1 star Very poor service. Upon arrival I was told my booking was not there but when I saw my name had been crossed off on the list it appeared someone else used my booking - and table. We were then sat away from the restaurant centre which was disappointing considering this was booked well in advance. We then sat with finished plates on our table for 30mins and were forced to use the same cutlery the whole night - not what you expect from a "fine dining" establishment. Variety - 3 starsUpon booking we were sent the menu and we were excited about the prospect of eating options. However on the night many items were not available with no explanation. Food - 3 stars3 stars is possibly being generous as well. Some items very bland, steak was nice one time and bland the next. Items which are usually tasty - tiger prawns - were made to be inedible. Overall - 2 stars Unfortunately I genuinely wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Having read the reviews beforehand and comparing against my experience, I really have to question how many of the reviews were genuine. P.S. If after reading this you still decide to go PLEASE mind your step when entering the washrooms. I am not alone in almost falling when entering thanks to no visible warning.

The staff provided excellent service and was very helpful to our various requests! Thanks to Jeremy and Jay for the coordination
5
Spread was very comprehensive and quality was high. Food was readily replenished and the desserts were great too! Would like to highlight the exceptional service of the staff, where they were prompt and friendly throughout the night. Furthermore, they even catered to our special request of celebrating a birthday for us. Special commendation goes out to Rajeev Manoharan for ensuring that we had a wonderful night
5
Very pleasant and prompt friendly service. I forgot my durian crepe (2plates) and 15mins later Chef keat thye brought it over to my table and realized he was going around looking for me. Exec Chef Andy Oh was very friendly service with a smile and Chef Keong offered to and taught me a few about oyster from various countries on display!Overall ambience is family oriented and Filbert was very efficient clearing our table in an non-intrusive manner. Will not be my last! 
5
A cosy place for a nice dinner! Was greeted by friendly service staff like Selena/Jay/Jeremy and nicely tucked in for my buffet with tip top hospitality! I have to mention that the chefs on duty also did a great job! Chef Andy, Chef Leong and Chef Eric whipped out delights at Live stations and even came to have short chats to ensure all was served and done nicely to my taste!Thumbs up!!

If you want a place that no one disturb you when you are dining. Choose this place, as they will leave in peace to have your buffet
4
I was there for a pre-christmas celebration with old friends from school. Total of 4 of us. Ambience was great and wide selection of food including 3 oyster varieties from US, France and Canada! First time I’ve been to a restaurant with more than 1 oyster variety! Other memorable eats was crab, crayfish and roast beef selection. The Chinese cooked food selection was pretty good too but it was impossible to try everything due to the huge collection. There is also a customized crepe station in which you can choose the toppings you want! Overall good value if you are looking to hang out in a nice place with extensive food selection
5
The price of the dinner buffet was reasonable and wallet-friendly. The service were excellent. This was the 2nd time I visited this place to celebrate my gf birthday. Again, this place did not disappoint us again! The manager make a lot of effort to interaction with guests and also take the extra mile to surprise guest whom are celebrating their birthday! He gathered the entire service team to sing a birthday song which caught my gf off-guard! Haha.. To touch on the food selection, there is a wide variety of seafood from freshly clucked oysters to lobsters to mud crab, tiger prawns and clams. However, do note the menu changes every month. For tea lovers, you will not be disappointed with their selection choice. Fear not, for coffee lovers their beans are rather fresh! Lastly, this place serve new zealand lemongrass and ginger ice-cream. You may also get to try the durian crepe which is heavenly!!

I went there with a date of mine on 4th of February for lunch. The reason why this review is being put up late is because i want to make sure i never miss out anything regarding my experience over there. First foremost we were welcome by the warm smile of the staff there which never failed to check up on us to make sure we were fine even though there was another huge group in the restaurant. I would like to personally thank Mr jeremy gomes,salina,joanne,faez,shin and tammy for their excellent service on that day and their undivided attention to my table on that day.i believe this really shows the attitude of all staff working there whereby they would ensure that you have a pleasant experience there. I also would like to thank chef andy and chef eric for their excellent service and to be served by the head chef really shows the emphasis of quality in the restaurant. I also would like to thank chef kelvin for his excellent work on the plates of pleasure which i would recommend strongly to try the beef ribs which is very soft and tender. Not forgetting of the likes of Chef anna and chef jasmine whom actually take the time to explain the dessert that were being served on the buffet line. All and all i would describe my experience there would be one of my finest and probably the most unforgettable experience in service quality and also in cuisine.I would definitely be back and would also highly recommend this restaurant to everyone.Cheers

1st visit, very good, recommend to all! Head Chef-Mr Oh, very friendly! We love here, we love all, nice food, nice environment, nice team

The buffet was voted as the one of the best international buffet. I've eaten at this restaurant both for lunch and dinner. The spread of the food is pretty good but the quality of the food is over-rated. I went for the buffet lunch on 29-Jan. The service was poor for the list of food from the menu. There were 5 of us for that lunch. Each time we would order a variety from the menu and we would be served only 1 or 2 dishes after more than 15 minutes and the rest were not served. This happened with more than 1 waiter so we felt that the problem lies with the kitchen...much to be improved
5
Better than my last visit. Fantastic spread of free flowing fresh lobsters from 5 different countries Ireland , Canada, France etc. keep up the great work !
5
The food tasted excellent , good variety . Good staff service , very efficient and quick ! a very nice place as well , lovely for eating 
4
Great buffet spread as usual..they brought back their Best menus to their patrons. Live stations have great and fresh foods as always. Applause to the superb service esp to the chefs the live stations and Jay the Asst Mgt; they are friendly, they look out for their guest when order is ready and not forgetting your fantastic service from your staff Malik. His very vigilant, provide great & sincere service.
5
This is my fourth visit and I brought another 7 relatives to try for their first time. I find this a great buffet in Singapore. The food is good, and the service is personal (on weekdays when it is quieter, the staff took time to look after my older relatives). I enjoy coming to this restaurant. The staff members Andy (chief chef), Jasmine, and the chefs at the food station were helpful and friendly
5
As I was just a walk-in guest, I and my friend went in and saw a spread of great variety of food that was awaiting to be eaten.. I and my friend really enjoyed every single food that was on the buffet and we really went for the Plate of Pleasure where they served great small bite size portions like fore gras, and lamb rack... My friend was into the crepes as she likes the sweet delights.. Everyone from the services side to the back of the kitchen was really helpful and was really great to the top notch. Really want to thank all the people especially the service staff and chefs that make me and my friend a special and memorable one... thank you and shout out to the people listed below... Service Staff.... Mr Jeremy, Aidil, Filbert & Ian..Kitchen Staff.... Chef Leong, Chef Eric, chef Kelly, Chin xiang, kelvin, and all that help to make it a enjoyable one... thank you all... ;
5
I enjoyed the buffet spread especially the fresh seafood served. Been wanting to try here for quite some time and finally managed to try it today. For sure I'm recommending this place to my families and friends! Worth every penny.
5
Had dinner here with wife for her birthday. Excellent assortment of seafood. Wife enjoyed lots of fresh oysters and lobsters. I had many wagyu steaks. Raw food we had was fresh, and cooked food was well-prepared and tasty. Would return for a third visit in 2016
5
Booked a table for 10. We enjoyed the spread of food.As mentioned by some reviewers many of the dishes are cooked fresh, including the wagyu beef, lamb chops and foie gras. The chilli lobster claw and durian dessert were my favourite dishes. All in all an enjoyable evening and we will be back
5
The Dining buffett was amazing, when you come just get from right row to middle until steak wagyu beef, thats the best part. Ala carte get Char kwetiauw and beef horfun, one of the best in the world i think
5
very very good place to eat. excellent and fresh seafood i will comeback very soon with a big pleasur
2
We had sunday brunch yesterday and all nine of us noted that food quality had dropped since our visit four months ago. The salmon and tuna sashimi were off-colour and inedible, there were no oysters although the advert at the entry to the restaurant showed there would be, breads were stale and some of the special ala carte items were tasteless.Very disappointing.
5
What a lovely restaurant. Thanks to Kevin , Marcus and Malik, of course must thank to all the chefs as well. We did enjoy evething there. Cannot forget their friendly smile and patient service . We also enjoy the food there , everything was just so delicious . Nice place to gather with friends , we will go back again for sure.

We're used to buffet places that are packed with hordes of people, have 5-7 stations and overflowing food that you may not see them all, and inconsistent service caused by diners overpowering the servers.10 at Claymore is different. Located at the Pan Pacific Orchard Hotel (not the apartments), this place probably seats 60. The small number of diners allow the chefs and servers to shine, with constant and polite service.Food on the buffet line was nothing spectacular, but they do have ala carte items that come with the buffet that you can order, and the foie gras and cod were very good. In short, if you want to have a quiet intimate buffet, this is the place to g
5
Had a great breakfast here. and the service is excellent. I liked the vegetarian indian cuisine they had here, as my girlfriend was vegetarian
5
Fabulous buffet with exceptionally good service! Chefs were extremely friendly and accommodating! Would definitely recommend i
5
Great buffet, not a big spread, but amazing seafood and steak. The dessert is pretty average and not very extensive. What i really like is the SERVICE. The staff very friendly and sincere. They are all polite, genuine, and they anticipate your needs. This is actually the main reason i am writing this review, which is to compliment the staff. Well done! Always a pleasure eating here (I visited 4-5 times in 2015

The sea food was moderately fresh and briny, nothing to shout about.The prawn noodles and cha kway tiao tasted like a muted version of what's available in Malaysia.Among the precooked meat options, the char siew and bbq pork were very mediocre, being tough and hard to chew.The braised/stewed beef was a highlight, it is well seasoned and well cooked so it wasn't hard to chew through. The steamed salmon was alright, not particularly fresh.The angus beef steak was another highlight the first time round, it was medium rare and juicy, on a return visit , it was significantly tougher, the inconsistency showed.The dessert was middling, the highlight being durian puffs choke full of the king of fruits , the masses of cream surrounding the puff made it too heavy though, an unnecessarily heavy touch.It's not like durian isn't heavy enough by itself.The tuna and salmon sashimi is fresh according to my dinner companion.The third highlight will have to be the codfish, it is tender and the fatty bits just had a melt in the mouth texture, clearly the highlight for me among the restaurant's famed plates of pleasure theme. A pity it was bony at times and it did prick my dinner companion unexpectedly.The fourth highlight for me was the foie de gras on a piece of toast, it was rich and buttery.A selection of hot teas were included and they were rather aromatic.The service was middling, When it approached 9.30pm our plates were not cleared timely, if at all. Overall, the spread wasn't big and alot of the food was mediocre, the four highlights i mentioned did save the day some what, but i was hoping for a little better from a buffet restaurant of such reputation
5
Great Service after work hours. The staff are very welcoming and the Manager Arjun has a very professional manner. He understands the needs of a Business Traveller

Visiting the second time, pleasantly surprised. The food is always prepared with highest quality standard. The Angus beef was irresistibly tender and yummy. Ham was so good. Oysters, prawn noodle, sashimi, lobsters, and plenty more to savior. Just love this place. Strongly recommend to all. Love it much.

Was there with my parents and siblings for Sunday Brunch. Food selection was fresh and service was great. Apart from the sumptuous spread on the buffet line, guests were also treated to a selection of Ala-carte orders that are bite / snacking size servings. I these include, foie gras, rack of lamb, poached cod, and what I highly recommend is the the award winning char kway teow; simple fare done very a splash of 'wok-ness'! Environment was clean and service staff makes you feel at home and welcomed
5
We went to the restaurant during our year end short break in Singapore. My wife wanted to have a good buffet, and I selected this restaurant based on good recommendation of Tripadvisor. The dinner proved to be a memorable one. The cold seafood and oysters were very good. The Angus steak was very nice and they offer very good choices of cheese. All the food are overall delicious. Definitely recommended the restaurant to friends.

Had buffet dinner on 24 December and enjoyed the wide spread of sea food, local and western dishes.The renowned Penand Kway Teow whipped up by Chef Andy was out of this world - fragrant with "wok breath". Best we have eaten and we certainly "polished up" the servings and had second helping.Other mouth watering dishes are was cheese baked lobster, the juicy and tender steaks prepared by Chef Leong Certainly, the standard of food served was excellent and to topped it off service was equally excellent with friendly and attentive service staff. Though it was full house there was no lacking in the service level at all. Keep it up and thanks for a great evening ! Kudos to the Management as well for having in place such a strong team that met out requests warmly and promptly.  "Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year"

Delicious, fresh, tasty, plentiful and a fantastic selection of food from around the world. A great atmosphere, wonderful and very friendly service. Thank you very much. Sue and Blu

Since this restaurant is still doing a 4 persons dining for the price of 3 promotion, our family of 3 treated a friend to here for dinner on last Saturday night. The cold platter section with lobster, sashimi and oysters etc suited the palate of my husband and our friend. There is also Angus beef on the spot to be cooked. You can request for how well you want the beef to be done. I chose medium well, and the beef seemed to be tender. There is a list of 5 dishes where we can choose from the menu to order too, with unlimited refilling allowed. My mom had the char kuey teow the signature dish which she commented was very good. My husband, myself and our friend had the foie gras. It is crunchy to the mouth, and the sauce came with a small piece of bread. Probably due to the current ban from the National Environmental Agency (NEA), that patrons did not order the cod fish. A lot of patrons are also afraid of the smell of the lamb, so also did not have the lamb chop. They are probably afraid of contamination, so did not order the mussels instead. There is also a variety of desserts available, and they came in bite-sizes in the buffet. There is also a pan cake section, where you can choose from durian, strawberry, banana and or chocolate etc. I think I had one of their small cheesecake which tasted good, and not too sweet, and it just suited my palates. They also have an exotic selection of ice cream flavour available that night too, which was garlic. My mom and myself both liked the taste of it, and wonder where the restaurant get this unique flavour from. About 1/4 of the restaurant that night was filled, for birthday celebration. Probably the restaurant was a bit busy that night, so the waiters did not manage to serve our tea after the buffet immediately, and that is understandable. This restaurant is definitely better than the Pan Pacific Hotel in Marina Square that we went to a few weeks ago

Went for Sunday dinner & restaurant was packed to brim. Food ranging from cold seafood (lobster, sashimi, oysters) to on-the-spot cooked beef, foie gras, cod, lamb chops were indeed tasty and delicious. Service provided was ever friendly and swift. Thumbs up!
5
Went to the restaurant for our family's early Christmas gathering. A really nice place for family gathering and all the staff were efficient and very approachable. The executive chef (Chef Andy) even brought us to our table when we reached which we don't see so often in other restaurants. This point just makes me feel that the staff here are very interactive and customer-oriented.A few must-try items:1) Chef Andy's Char Kway Teow2) Angus beef from the ala carte menu & stewed beef from the buffet line3) Durian Crepe4) Chili crab with fried mantouI will recommend this place to my friends
5
Food was awesome and there is a wide variety of choices. Service is efficient and staffs were approachable. Chef Eric and the staffs provided good service to us on 18/12/15. Is a must to come...!!
5
Went to this buffet for our team dinner after reading the great reviews on Trip advisor. Was not disappointed at all. I am not an oyster fan but my colleagues just love the 3 different types of oysters. The crayfish was fresh and fantastic, as well as the sashimi. The crepe was frankly out of the world. The buffet spread is not big but the quality of the food is top notch.The goose liver ordered from the menu is very good, it just melt in your mouth. This is a must try
5
Must try chef Andy Char Koay Teow and Penang Prawn Mee. The best and so "yummy " service are good too..Many choices of pastry and "tumb" up for the crispy durian crepe. Not to forget is the plate pleasure lamb of rack and the oyster too....surely come back again. Again Thanks for lovely surprise birthday cake ...
5
You must come and try it if you are buffet lover. Someone like this restaurant as No. 1 in Singapore, fresh lobsters, Oysters, juicy lamb, steak, and Parma ham...etc. The waiters was politely giving their service. I enjoyed this dinner
5
We visited the restaurant to celebrate a friend's birthday. The restaurant ambience was cozy and nice. The quality of food was good and all very fresh. However the variety of the dishes available has some room for improvement.We enjoyed the idea of the live stations. Freshly prepared crepes were amazing.I personally love the selection of Gryphon Teas. Service was impeccable. Service staffs were very friendly specially the manager on duty Jay. He was super. The price was quite reasonable for everything.
5
Good variety of tasty food. Service is excellent as well.It has a spacious environment with nice ambience. Great for gathering
5
Improve alot better then my last visit. The beef is good. The soup is nice. Great place for gathering with friends and family
5
We just had a buffet dinner at the hotel last night, and this is our 4th time to have the dinner at the hotel. The buffet is great and my two children loves the food so much. To be honest, the food is excellent and the service from all the staff are superb!. For seafood lovers,salmon/tuna, lobster, crab and three type of oysters are must to try as they were so fresh and delicious.Do not forget the crepes. it was so crispy! I like the one with durian but my other families like peanut butter flavor. I want to eat already...
5
We visited 10 at Claymore for their Sunday buffet. Great place to eat if you love crustaceans. Crabs, lobsters and many varieties of mussels. Chef Andy was kind enough to prepare his acclaimed Char Kway Teow which was one of the best I have tried. Definitely value for money and a great place for a quiet Sunday buffet.
5
The good reviews on Hungry Go Where brought me here. Had dinner on Tuesday 1st December 2015. The place was not packed (that's how I like it :)) so we had the full and undistracted attention of the service staff. Had my fill of lobster, oysters, foie gras, Angus, Wagyu, and Cod just to name a few. Staff demonstrated initiative and self direction. I should have taken more careful note of the name of the server who attended to us. After ordering the same beverage a couple of times, she automatically came by to refill without my asking. She also took the trouble to ask if we wanted any additional items and/or dishes that required preparation from the kitchen during her visits. The devil is in the details as they say and little things like these distinguish the difference between a great versus a good experience. Furthermore, when it came time to settle the bill, the F&B manager did not need any prompting to suggest which credit cards had more generous discounts and/or offers. I will definitely be back again but for now....I'll need at least a week for all the rich food to settle :). My compliments to everyone working there - excellent effort and keep up the great work!Cheers,Luk

Decided to eat in one night whilst staying at the Pan Pacific Orchard, so booked a table at this restaurant.We were seated very quickly and advised about the Buffet options which were truly amazing. Oysters freshly shucked for you on the spot with 3 varieties to choose from. Chefs on hand to cook fairly much anything you wanted from steak, chicken, noodles to seafood.Selection of options for all courses was extensive which wasn't too good for my waistline, but I am so glad we were able to visit this venue and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Would love to visit here again
5
Decided to go here at the drop of a hat.Booked on line but did not work, however no problem when we arrived they were very accommodating.Everything was excellent from the helpfulness of the greeting staff to the waiting staff, ambience, chefs but most of all the food. Sensational and as much as you want. The menu was called plates of pleasure I think but whatever it was called the food and especially the selection was wonderful!Highly recommended and not too dear!
5
Located at the Lobby Level of the hotel, the breakfast and lunch spread is huge and the food is quite tasty. The crepes served during lunch are a must have
5
We stayed at the Pan Pacific Orchard for four nights and had the Buffet at 10 at Claymore - excellent - could not fault it - we are from Australia and generally frequent the Gold Coast for seafood buffets - this one really hit the spot and was the best I have had in a long time - cooked Angus steak as you watched - great natural oysters - all the locals seemed to eat here which is generally a good sign - chilly crab - you name it and it was here - chocolate fondue - need I say more
5
Stayed at the hotel for three nights and had dinner two out of those three nights. The choice of food is vast and the service was excellent. On the weekends the restaurant is fully booked but during the week you can eat in a relaxing atmosphere with personal service from the executive chef and staff
5
We hade the best birthday buffet meal ever here. there were 4 of us and the bill was only 225 SG dollars! and with the offer that was on we got one free so it went down to 175. the food was out of this world as was the service and drinks. You must try the Lamb and beef. Very , Very Nice
5
Good food from appetizers to desserts. Seafoods choices the best! Desserts fron cakes to ice cream at its best! Service is also excellent.
5
Dine in with friends! We have a lovely dinner with chef andy personally cook his signature dish for us. Thank you! We really did enjoyed our dinne
5
We dined at 10 at Claymore for both Dinner and Breakfast. Both meals were exceptional.The breakfast was included in our hotel package. The dinner was an option we selected after reading other reviews on TripAdvisor. After a long day touring Singapore we really didn't want to travel far for dinner. Seeing that we had already booked into the Pan Pacific Orchid and the restaurant was located in the lobby, this was an easy decision.The service is friendly and efficient. The atmosphere and décor are spotlessly clean and inviting. The wine list is well balanced. The food is to die for!The best sushi and sashimi that I have enjoyed for years. Prawns, crayfish, bugs the freshest you will ever taste. Oysters from USA, France and Canada are exceptional. Top shelf steak cooked to order... the list goes on.It is apparent that "only the best" is a motto here amongst the kitchen team - and it shows.I really had to look very hard to find faults. I noticed a few - but they were largely of little significance - too minute to spoil a fabulous meal.The meal itself is actually quite reasonably priced given what is on offer. (Roughly $70 per person).Expect to pay significantly more if you would like a few beers and cocktails and a bottle of wine with your meal. We quite easily spent another $210 on drinks between 2 people. A bottle of wine starts at $70 and goes up from there. A pint of Heineken sells for around $26.The $85 bottle of Chardonnay from Chile that I selected was a delightful drop - but I would rarely spend that much when dining out.Overall, I give this restaurant a whole-hearted "thumbs up"
3
Went there with family for a special occasion. There was a good variety of food but unfortunately the food was very cold, and super substandard. We had to keep asking the waiters to reheat our food. Enjoyed the dessert though - mainly crepes.
5
Went for dinner with my family to celebrate my mum's 60th Birthday.We are very happy with their wonderful hospitality by their Assistant Manager, Jay, chef Andy, chef Leong, chef kiong and other staff that serves us that night.We had 4 treasures broth, beef, lamb, char koay teow and durian crepes. All the dishes are awesome with great cooking methods and will sure return again. Thank you to all the staff that serves us that night.

Very good hotel with excellent kitchen. Different kind of noodles and other local dishes along with a range of sweets. There was a very kind girl making crêpes as well.
3
Spread is nice. Went for Angus beef, lobster,fresh oysters and crab. Seafood section not replenished that much. Managed to get 2 pcs crab legs then when I went back only 1 leg left waiting for them to put in more but none came. Love those crab legs as it is sweet.Other dishes were okDessert plates and spoon got finished maybe they are understaff that night to even notice it.Staff were courteous and nice. But I always need to remind them to refill my glass with water. Prompt in removing dirty plates
5
Had ala carte dinner on 18/09/15 to celebrate my mother in law's birthday and was served by Jay and his team. They are always there when we needed something. I really can't find any fault with any of the 5 dish served. Fried Kway Tiao was nicely done with the char fregance from the wok. They are simply delicious! Special thanks to Chef Andy & Chef Leong for their hospitality and Chef Kelly for the wonderful Durian Crêpe. Everyone left happy and full! Definitely will return!
4
I visited this restaurant during my vacation at lunch time. Foods are delicious and services are excellent! The toilet is clean and convenient.Must eat : the salmon sushi, salmon steak, and steamed pork.A little disappointment ; no oysters and beef steaks are served at lunch :
5
I went there with my dad and his friends on 11/9/2015 to celebrate my dad's birthday, and I'm so glad I picked this restaurant. The service staff was very thoughtful calling my mum beforehand to arrange the seating arrangement and surprising my dad with a birthday cake when my mum barely mentioned that is was for his birthday. While the spread was not large, the food quality of each dish was excellence. Thumbs up for the service and kitchen staff for the great service and food. We would definitely return soon
5
Lots of local and international food prepared for breakfast and dinner. Love the seafood specially the lobster and the fresh oyster
5
We had the buffet lunch on 7th Sep. It was a last minute booking and we were happy with the place. It has a spacious environment, the food was good although there was no oyster or lobster. However, the price is reasonable. Also, the manager Selena was was helpful and we are very satisfied with the service. Glad that we found this place
5
I Must say spread was minimal but Quality is Superb. Well done Chef! Since my 2 day Seminar seminar was over @ the hotel. Manager Salina is a True Blue Hospitality! Will recommend this place to Friends...
5
Buffet at 10 @ claymore was impressive as ever. Standard of food is always well maintained even for buffet lunch .Good Job!
4
The overall spread was nice. Oysters are fresh and really good! Sashimi, steaks and the lamb shank are not to be missed too! Do try them out! Service is prompt, staffs are friendly and attentive. The ala carte buffet style of local dishes, on the other hand are mediocre at best. Too salty and portion are small. Nonetheless, it was a great experience and I wouldn't mind heading there back again
5
We went to Claymore bistro to have our dinner celebrating one of our colleague's promotion. There were a total 6 of us. The chef welcome us warmly and the buffet dinner was amazing. Tasty grilled lamb rack was one of my favourite, served together with specially made citrus sauce, what a heavenly combination. The rest of the food came in numerous various, there were fresh sashimi & oysters, tender beef steak , Singaporean style chili crabs, Chay Kway Teow and Pie Tee.The staff were friendly and Service was excellent throughout our dinner. I will definitely revisit this restaurant and anyone who visiting Singapore should make a trip to 10 Claymore bistro to try their food
3
I made a booking thru email and confirmed. I request for a piece of cake as my gf got her pass renewal, Surprisingly the cake was brought to us is a "happy birthday" message on the plate of muffin instead of " Congratulation"We got no choice just to blow a candle but im sooooo really upset and i dont know how am i going to explain to my partner. I read the email when i reached home and write a feedback. Hope it wont happen to your guest anymore, because it was really a messed!
5
We ate buffet style at both breakfast and dinner during a 12 night stay. As mentioned in my review of the hotel, the Aberdeen Angus was cooked in front of me by a young chef. It was the best steak I have ever tasted (and I often choose steak). The food is very varied at every meal. At breakfast there is a full choice of every cereal, speciality bread, european hams and cheeses, toast, spreads,,, as well as a full choice of local food (dumplings and noodles for a start!). Similarly in the evening the choice is very broad to suit all tastes with both Eastern and Western food fully represented.If I had to be picky..... they do not have red bush tea (rooibos) available (I did manage to get it once, but none of the staff on subsequent visits knew of it. And you do have to remind the staff that if you want milk with tea, it should be cold (!). Otherwise I can't really fault it. The service was excellent
5
Visited 10 on 30 august, the layout of the place is grand. Got seated as soon as i entered this restaurant. Staff with great smile servicing throughout the whole dinning experience. Manager jeremy being friendly and helpful by recommending their local dishes on the menu. Their seafood are particularly fresh. Chefs explaining the different kind of oysters and their features. Their cooked food were also cooked deliciously. Would like to go for second round of food but i am too full merely on the first round as there are too much varieties of foods. Would definitely visit 10 at claymore again with this fantastic dining experience.
5
Was recommended by colleagues to visit 10 @ claymore, food taste awesome, dishes were well prepared!staff was really alert & helpful.station chefs too are friendly, was always welcome with a smile on their face!Everything was done as requested regardless the floor crew or chefs on duty!highly recommend to all who wants the best meal to dine there!been there 3 times within half a year

I decided to celebrate my daughter's birthday here and there was no disappointment but full of surprises the moment we stepped into the restaurant.Upon arrival, our reservation was promptly recognised and we settled down nicely. Food was aplenty and selection was good. However, as being middle-age, I tend to pick a few of my favourites.Beef 1855: The steak was cooked to order and it was nicely done accordingly by a very able young chef. The sauces to go for it was also excellent. If I remember rightly, I had about 4 or 5 serving. (Note: I exercised vigorously and hence the huge quantity of protein!)Durian crepe: being a Singaporean, how could I miss the durian crepe. Heavenly! Crispy crepe prepared by a young, pretty female chef, with moist and creamy fresh during inside.Lamb chop (compliment from the Chef): I have never tasted such nicely cooked lamb chop before. Even my wife, who does not eat anything that bleats, finished off her portion. The outer layer was nicely cooked and yet the inside was still soft and tender.Penang Fried Kway Teow and Prawn Noodle: Knowing that I came from Penang, the Chef also helped to alleviate my home-sickness!It even has a counter that makes good coffee (cappuccino, espresso, etc) and tea. Fruit juices are available also.The restaurant is of the right size with the layout. The ambience was relaxing, and because the tables were properly spaced, I do not feel the tightness of a normal buffet restaurant. Without knowing, the 2 1/2 hours of lunch passed by quickly.Some criticised that there was no meat (totally untrue), did not pass them the a la carte menu (but this is a buffet restaurant to start with), etc. I found them all to be untrue.Service staff was well trained and efficient, starting from the lady at the reception right to the one clearing the table.Because of my schedule, we could only go for the Saturday lunch. I should try the dinner next time. (The Chef said that the selection is even better!!) Slurp!

Evening meal - I ordered a lasagne from the a la carte menu as I did not want a large evening meal.Unfortunately the first one had to be replaced as it was still frozen in the centre. The replacement was OK - the staff did not appear concerned and no attempt was made to compensate for a mistake that may have been dangerous to my health. My colleague had the buffet that was excellent - so hence the rating. Breakfast in this restaurant was OK - it was the usual hotel breakfast buffet with a cook station freshly preparing eggs etc. Unfortunately the serving staff were not as well trained or as attentive as in other parts of the hotel. I frequently had to leave my table to find a member of staff to request a tea or coffee. This was around 7.00 am when the restaurant was not busy. I switched to eating breakfast in the Pacific club floor and the contrast was amazing.This experience was in very sharp contrast to the rest of the hotel stay which was excellent
5
The food here was super good and has a wide range of local food. They also have a lot of seafood which were really fresh. I especially loved the salmon and sword fish. They also have a chocolate fondue which will appeal to the children.
5
We enjoyed the food and the service staffs were friendly as you feel like eating at home. A lot of excellent Seafood and variety to choose from. Best selection of vegetarian Salads and a variety of Steaks for meat lovers
5
Food and service staff was excellent. Service with a smile. Surprised birthday cake was an extra mile. Thank you, 10 at Claymore for making our birthday girl an unforgettable experience

After reading the reviews on here, and being part of the Pan Pacific hotel, we decided to give this place a try. The decor was quite elegant, and the buffet spread looked interesting, but not particularly fresh.We were greeted by a chef who happened to be passing by before the manager came along and seated us. We opted for the a la carte menu. It was difficult to choose from the menu as the selection was limited and the menu was not very descriptive. The manager/waiter who came to serve us was unsure about the fish of the day and had to check. Our drink orders were taken by another waiter, and about 10 mins later the manager/waiter came along and asked us if we wanted any drinks. The complementary bread was served before our drinks and was average at best. We ordered the grilled Ciabatta bread as an entree, which after arriving, was not grilled. We asked the manager/waiter and they said that's how its normally served. The chef later came along and said if we wanted it grilled, however we were already disappointed and said it was fine and we'd just like our mains. We ordered salmon(fish of the day), a prawn/noodle/pork dish and a wagyu beef burger. The salmon was poorly seasoned, but grilled well, the noodle dish was more of a ramen than the dry noodles we expected(because the menu was not specific) and it was rather bland. The wagyu beef burger was average, but certainly not worth the $29 price tag. Due to the error in grilling the ciabatta, we were offered a selection of fruits, a glass of wine and a plate of taster deserts(which appeared to be from the buffet).Overall the food was poor to average, the staff seemed confused and didn't really know how to serve an a la carte menu. Overall it was a let down, considering the image appears to be striving for 5 stars. From my experience I wouldn't recommend the a la carte menu at this place as it is overpriced, and the food is average. The environment of the restaurant was also rather poor, there was a group of children running around at a table next to us and it seemed more of a buffet place
5
The restaurant was intimate. We were pleasantly greeted at the reception by the staff who was friendly and polite before being seated. There was a huge variety of food in the buffet from fresh seafood(e.g.: Alaskan King Crab legs, crayfish, sashimi etc.) to other local and international cooked food. The desserts served was phenomenal especially the chocolate based desserts.All the staff that served us were great were well trained service wise.I would definitely come again for family gatherings or other occasions

My husband chanced upon this restaurant while searching for a place to celebrate my birthday. While I thought we had tried all the buffets at major hotels so far, 10@Claymore has been hiden under our radar all these while. Hence we were pretty excited to dine at a new restaurant.Upon reaching, we were greeted warmly by Mr Arjun who was quick to assist us with a baby chair and ensure we were comfortable. The ambience was cosy and perfect. We like the ala carte menu as the food is served piping hot and taste great. The spread is thoughtful with sashimi, fresh oysters and seafood with the usual mains. The star dish of the night was the lamb shanks for me;simply melt in my mouth.Shortly, the team threw a surprise for me with a bday song and lovely cake as arranged by hubby earlier. We appreciate the gesture thank you so much.We totally enjoyed the dining experience and these are what really exceed our expectations1) thank you Arjun for offering to pack the birthday cupcake for me. usually we are so full that we have no room to eat and it's really a kind gesture from you 2) thank you Arjun for checking with us if we need parking coupon when we settle the bill. It was nice to be asked than having to request for it3) the entire service team was on the ball and very prompt. they tried to engage with my 1year old boy on and off :)and if I may suggest the following that will ace my expectation in the future,1) there are only 1 kids friendly hotel restaurant I seen so far and I hope there will be more. Perhaps there can be a separate ala carte menu for children. As parents we just want healthy and wholesome food for them. Pasta, simple congee or rice porridge etc would be perfect.once again thank you to the wonderful team for a memorable dinning experience for us. Pls keep up the good wor

We had our first visit to 10 at Claymore in July 2015 and there was the ongoing promotion, "Oyster Occassions" for the dinner buffet.Being the occassion for oysters, the main highlight was none other than the 6 types of live oysters, freshly shucked upon order. The 6 types being the plump and tasty U.S and Canadian, the firm-fleshed Australian, the crunchy and sweet New Zealand, the rare Ireland, and the delicate and mild French oysters.The fresh seafood on ice was no less commendable with lobsters, queen roe scallops and mussels to name a few. They were all fresh and exuding with the natural sweetness distinct to fresh seafood.Though not a wide selection, the assorted sashimi were fresh and definitely of quality. The maguro(tuna) was firm, and the salmon and mekajiki(swordfish) had impressive fat content which made it the one of the best that I have had.The decadent 1855 Black Angus Tenderloin is grain-fed and is grilled a-la minute to your preferred doneness. It boasted amazing texture and was free of any sinews. The chefs prepared the steaks with minimal seasoning of only salt and pepper which allowed the natural flavour of the beef to stand out and I must say that it is something to die for!Plates of Pleasure featured tasting portions of fine cuisine prepared upon order and were also available in unlimited servings to diners. To name a few, there was Escolar Cod in miso glaze, Free Range Lamb Rack and Kurobuta Pork.Dessert spread was great featuring a live crepe station and chocolate fountain.Also included was a fine selection of Gryphon teas and coffee beverages which is quite rare for buffets.The overall dining experience was excellent with great service from friendly staff at the bistro.All in all, a wonderful buffet for food lovers who appreciate the natural flavours of food as the chefs here do not excessively baste the food in sauce
4
The restaurant is not large, not in terms of some of megabuffets. But the spread is good. Oysters variety is superb... 6 to choose from. The caramelized pineapple with the gammon ham is simply heaven.There is also the list of 8 to 10 specially cooked for the diner choice that has cod, rack of lamb and fried kway teow.The tea, while some restaurants will serve you the standard Earl Grey, I typically prefer either chamomile or mint as these are caffeine free, and yes, there is a selection of at least 10 types
3
Having read the rave reviews on here I booked dinner for my wife and I confident we would enjoy a great experience. Unfortunately it was not the case. On arrival a young waitress showed us to our table, put a buffet food list on the table, said help yourselves and rapidly departed. I thought perhaps to bring wine list and a la carte but sadly not. I got up and went back to the restaurant reception and told them we were not interested in the buffet, I wanted the a la carte menu and a wine list please.Not a great start and difficult to come back from, although the manager conveyed through one of the servers that our dessert was on the house, I presume to make up for the bad start.The food we were served was good and the desserts fine but it is difficult to relax when the start is so poor. I could see a lot of locals enjoying the buffet, few with any alcohol so perhaps this is normal. But we were tourists looking for the great meal written about on here. Such a disappointment
5
My family celebrated my sister's birthday at the restaurant today. The spread was extensive - ranging from freshly squeezed fruit juices to fried char kway teow that we could order off another menu. The sashimi and seafood were also very fresh. We were very impressed by the service staff at the restaurant. Service was prompt and efficient. Since it was her birthday, the staff prepared a surprise cake for my sister. In particular, at the BBQ pork ribs counter, Chef Andy was extremely friendly and accommodating to our needs. The price was also reasonable and the ambience pleasant. Overall, we had an amazing time there, and would definitely come back
3
Onus was on us to check if the Blackmore Wagyu Beef Tenderloin and/or more grilled meats were available for the Weekend Lunch menu - I didn't check. So the reservation was made and only upon reaching on 25 Jul, did we realised that the Plates of Pleasure had no actual Meat mains...! I am now assuming that it was only for the Dinner menu?From reservation making, to reservation time pushing back (had to change it once), to arrival and being welcomed, the service was truly impeccable. I was actually contemplating leaving after one of the nice wait staff elaborated on the Plates menu and after a quick look from the distance at the stations available. My dining partner (BF) was hankering after some meats and we thought to try PanPac's buffet since we had never ate here before... Well I did not 'speak up' and I mean, since we are here, might as well give ya a try, plus the service has been pretty good up till then.To be honest, none of the cooked selections e.g. Braised Lamb Shank, or the stewed beef thingy excited us. We did not go for a 2nd helping after taking a reaaaally small tasting potions of those and the other dishes like the fish, vegs etc. Sadly I must mention this: I also tasted grit in 3 out of the 7 mussels I took. I initially feared that one nearly broke a ceramic filling I just did to replace an old amalgam one on my molar a month ago...that was certainly an appetite killer.The Gryphon teas were good though. And I do like the cheese platter, went for a few servings on that! I usually am not big on pastries but the custard puff was pretty decent and the pecan pie was just the right amount of chewy and crunch.I am not sure if I will be back or even to try your Dinner menu as this Lunch experience was honestly disappointing - food wise. My BF has said that he definitely will not. Hes not a seafood person at all so he cant attest to the limited seafood selection on the day we visited. He also prefers meat dishes, red meat to be exact. So you can understand why this experience - the lack of meat would stay in his mind for some time to come and potentially put him off your Dinner buffet, too.We have a late afternoon thing to attend to thats why we could only do a Lunch buffet. I would tried to juggle our schedule and gone for the Dinner one really if I had known beforehand that the Lunch menu would be like this....again, I should have asked while on the phone with ya BUT I had also expected my viewing of the official webpage of 10 at Claymore to have been 'enough' while making a reservation. It did say "Our Cuisine:" ...and it included that Signature dish. I find it pertinent to at least mention that the Signature would NOT be available for Lunch...Therefore, PLEASE update this page (http://www.panpacific.com/en/hotels-resorts/singapore/orchard/stay/dining/10-at-claymore.html) to reflect the Lunch menu NOT carrying Blackmore Wagyu Beef Tenderloin. That was really the only reason why I suggested PanPac Orchard to my BF

10 at Claymore is my favorite buffet restaurant in Singapore. The setting and ambiance is conducive for dinner with friends or business partners. I am a firm believer in quality over quantity when it comes to a buffet and this restaurant does it perfectly. The quality of food makes up for the slightly smaller selection of food and it is topped off with excellent service from the management and wait staff. I have been coming here for the past 3-4 years and I will always be back for more
5
we took our breakfast there, there are many different kinds of food, western , eastern, indian, for vegan's . oatmeals for children, omlets are fine. i can say that the food are up to standard. you won't be disappointed.
5
Had dinner there with my family of 23 paxs last saturday. Simply love the oyster and angus beef steak. So heavenly! Service was good and they cleared the plates quite promptly. We will be back soon
5
Back at Claymore again..the excellent service provided makes me go back for more, especially during the yearly oyster festival affair..even though the spread may not be extensive, it more than makes up for it with the quality..there were 6 types of oysters from different countries, king crab,scallops and beef, barbecued pork ribs, the different plates of pleasure..we also tried the durian crepe which was great but really filling..special thanks to the crew especially Chef Eric,Jay, chef Kelly..will definitely be back again..keep up the good work
5
My family recently lunched at 10@Claymore. We are impressed by the good service and attention given to us by chef Eric and the team. Highly recommended for the friendly and relaxing atmosphere for a good lunch. We will be back
5
Went back to dine with my wife after quite a few months, which I left the country for some business progress. Pleasantly felt for the great food offered and the great service rendered to us. Warmly greeted and Chefs are always as friendly as cheerful...I realized there has been quite a tremendous change in staffing, however, still a great team. As a regular, of course we are remembered and newly promoted Executive Sous Chef Cheah Hun Leong personally, skillfully prepared and whipped up his great culinary signatory dish for us to savour, while Award Winning Pastry Chef Eric Cheam has got his delicate hands on great personal touches for us
5
Few of us went to the dinner buffet, really love the way they serve the food..they will only open the ouster when you order!! Also all sashimi are freshly cut when you order ~ oyster from six different region, and the chef are so friendly to explain the differences~ we had so much oyster & lobster... The mini angus steak is one of my favorite, the meat was very tender and tasty...that's ashamed I have no much space for Asian food after so much seafood and dessert...definitely will go back again for the buffet
5
Visited 10 at Claymore for the second time and I am still very impressed with the quality of food provided and excellent service of the staff, special mention to Icha. If you value quality over quantity, you should visit this buffet place
4
It was a very good dinner experience for my husband and I. I enjoyed the freshly shuck oysters from 6 different countries as well as the other seafood selection. The sushi, cooked food and soup section was average. The highlight of my dinner is definitely the durian crepe (crispy). And the service was excellent. Most of the waiters are very friendly and keen to serve especially Icha. She went all the way out to help me get my favourite dessert and I really appreciate her excellent and thoughtful service! Thanks for the great dinner experience
4
Was there for my first Sunday Brunch, food was great! There's a selection of oysters from different region, steak was cooked to my liking! Durian crepe with peppermint ice-cream! Yumz! Not forgetting the awesome F&B and Culinary team, Exec Chef, Jeremy, Selina and Jay (names i can remember at this moment...)! Well done
5
Visited 10 at Claymore recently for a family gathering. The relaxed ambiance of the restaurant is good for gathering. Food served was excellent especially the plate of pleasure which includes many Penang food. Friendly chefs and attentive service staffs makes our dining experience even more enjoyable. The best part of the buffet is definitely the crispy durian crepes cooked on the spot. I will recommend this restaurant for any kind of occasion and I will visit this restaurant again soon
5
My 2nd time back to 10 at Claymore. The quality of fodd and the tip top service never let me down, thanks to Sarina, Jay and Jeremy. Love the 7 types of oysters, kurobuta pork, lamb racks, char koay teow, laksa, Angus beef, lobster thermidor and durian crepe.. quality of food was great and service was excellent as well: attentive, friendly and efficient, which rounded off our dining experience marvellously. I will be back
5
The seafood selection is excellent, with lobsters and 6 types of oysters. The durian crepe is a rare find as well. Service is impressive. A member of staff helped a small child coat her marshmallow in chocolate by carrying her to the same height as the chocolate fondue machine.
4
The food is so nice especially the durian crepe and the seafood on ice. Beside the lamb and the kimchi kurobuta pork in the plate of pleasure we love it so much. The service staff and the chefs are so friendly. My friends and I had a great gathering at here and we will come back again
5
My family and I came here for dinner for my mums birthday. The raw food was great, the oysters and the sashimi! The beef, the prawn noodle and the lemon grass ice cream too. What made the night great was the service, everyone was incredibly friendly and pleasant, and approached guests with such a heart, in particular Sasha, who was really sweet and cheerful. I was having a pretty bad day, but just feeling the warmth and friendliness from the staff turned the night around
5
Visited and dine few times this year. A nice & friendly to revisit whenever occasion to celebrate or a day to dine in. Food are fresh, service is always warm very visit. Never fail us. We are actually planning to revisit for upcoming family celebration soon. Cya Pan Pacific
5
Have a great experience dinner and service . Oyster and seafood selection very fresh. Food very tasty and good quality selection, special mention Penang chat koay teow and Penang laksa (must try ) . Desserts selection very tempting and not very sweet just nice for my family. Chef very friendly . At last don't forget to try US ANGUS BEEF 1855 , it's very nice .
5
Im Mrs Linda and i came for dinner buffet for the first time.As i was around orchard i actually just wanted to see the old Negara hotel changed but i was being attracted to the buffet.Seeing the spread for $72++ was worth every penny especially the seafood and oyster collection they have but what make the dinner worth was the service given by Roziana. I did not want to came for dinner but through the guide of Roziana, she has made me to seat in to enjoy the spread.Thats not all, whenever she pass by my table, she would ask how is the buffet, anything she could help and she addresses me and my husband by our names. We really felt like Vip.The restaurant was packed yesterday but she manage to pull it off with her cheerfulness.The whole ambience was superb.An asset to the restaurant besides the superb spread!Thank you Roziana and 10@claymore.Will definately come again
4
I have a wonderful dining experience with my family & relatives at 10 @ Claymore for my birthday celebration.It didn't disappoint us once again with the wide spread of fresh live oysters (from 6 different countries), lobsters & sashimi. I was so happy to receive a complimentary cake from them as it brightens the whole birthday celebration.I also wish to compliment a female staff (Icha) who was always there when we need her. Her friendliness & helpfulness service has indeed contributed to our prefect dining experience
5
I was there for buffet together with some friends. The have lots of seafood selections such as lobsters and oyster. Their steak is really good too which is prepared and cooked on the spot when you order. Their "Must Try" Char Koey Tiow is good and taste the same as Penang's. The queue for the Crepe is quite long and I would recommend the durian crepe. All the staff are friendly and very helpful if you need anything. They clear the plates really fast. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a good buffet
5
Celebrated my birthday here in Singapore. And 10@Claymore is one of the reason why I will be coming back. Lovely setting with great food especially the freshly schucked oysters and grilled Angus beef and not forgetting the great penang dishes. Staff are very courteous and attentive. Don't miss this place whenever you are in the city
5
1) FoodThe food there was good and there was a wide spread of buffet. The sashimi there would be cut and served by a chef and it was really fresh. The angus beef was also freshly cooked in front of you and it tasted great. Overall, the food was great.2) ServiceThe service was very good. The staff were very friendly & attentive, they would constantly come around the table to clear the plates. You could also request to have the food delivered to your table so you do not have to take your own food at times.The only negative experience was the parking at the hotel. The carpark to the hotel was very old, narrow & rundown. It makes me wonder why such a lovely hotel has such an old car park which is not renovated.Overall, I had a great dining experience. The prices are $73++, about an average prices of an international seafood buffet. Currently, there is a promotion of 1 free dining for every 3 paying customer when you pay with OCBC/DBS/POSB/UOB cards
5
Had enjoy most of the food variety. Freshly slice Sashimi, wagyu beef carving station , nicely carve gammon ham and crispy durian crepes with a scoop of ice cream. Services are up to expectations
5
We have visited many this restaurant many times. This time was to celebrate Father's Day. The food was fantastic as usual. They have a wide and fabulous spread for their buffet. Service is also impeccable. Both the kids and the adults had a good time. A good family restaurant
5
Fresh food, great quality and wide variety of desserts!. I've been to eat here 3 times so far. The ambience is great, the layout is spacious, the service is attentive and the food definitely did not disappoint each time. Lots of attention to detail was given and food is excellent
5
First time visiting and will come back again. It has a wide food selection. Authentic penang food can be found here too. A must try will be the char kuey teow and durian crepe. Service staff were attentive in ensuring we had a pleasant meal. Two thumbs up!
4
The buffet spread was satisfying and I was spoilt for choices! The cod fish and beef were especially delicious and there was also an international variety of oysters which was pretty new and interesting! On top of that, service there was impeccable! The staff were very attentive and helpful and additionally, the chefs stationed at the food stations were also very friendly! I would like to commend Chef Andy for his touching gesture for asking the kitchen to make my mom a delicious salmon dish after I casually mentioned to him how my mom was disappointed that there was only raw salmon as she was looking forward to having some cooked salmon dish at the buffet! The kitchen even prepared a special sauce to eat with the salmon which I felt was a really nice gesture :) (refer to photo attached for the dish) Kudos to the other chefs (like Chef Eric and Chef John) for the great service too! Overall, it was a great evening & I would recommend to give 10 @ Claymore a try, totally worth the money! :-
5
Went for dinner last week with my girlfriend. The buffet spread were great, especially the 6 types of oysters from all around the world and unlimited serving of US Angus Beef. Service staffs were very attentive. Nice place for couples
1
Was full of hope and expectations for the buffet. Started well enough, 6 types of oysters and i had one each. I had seafood chowder, durian crepe, tiramisu, cereal prawns, chocolate ice-cream, a few pieces of roast duck and char siew. After a while, i started to feel queasy and felt like vomiting, i left the restaurant after a while and vomited on my way back. I felt terrible. I checked with my dinner companions and 3 out of 12 of them had similiar symptoms. The restaurant management had better review their food handling processes. Worst buffet experience. Will not go back even if they offer me a free meal.
5
very good services. nice environment n nice food. especially the seafood n sasimi...all is very fresh
4
Brought few Japanese colleagues after quater business review & had dinner buffet. they love the seafoods & oysters served, needless to mention on laksa & char kuey teow =) Service was attentive & friendly. Planning to visit there again next month
1
The dinner ambience was great with good service until the live worms under the oyster meat appeared. The sight of the worms and it's moving legs was gross. Appetite was affected and no one dare to take oyster after that. This is our first time encountering live worms, terrifying and will give oyster a miss for a while. A disappointing experience.
5
the omelette and pancakes that was made by the old chef was great, it tasted just like the way he did it , delicate , skillful and with grace, one of the best pan cakes i have tasted so far that was prepared on the spot!
5
It was my first visit here...the food was absolutely super...the service was incomparable...attentive...casual...friendly with a homely feel...the Penang cuisine was the closest thing to the original than anywhere in Singapore. Chef Andy... Jayandrran and Kavitha was absolutely on the ball... Assets for sure. Keep it up and I will be back soon. Quality of service and food is way above expectations
5
10 at Claymore's buffet spread is amazing with the best oysters and tip top service provided by their servers (Sasha) and manager (Jeremy). When I asked for a cappuccino, which was included in the buffet spread, Sasha made a nice cup of cino for me and even beautify it with some coco powder. She's also always looking around for plates to clear and always have a smile on her face. Great client service values!
5
Sumpstous spread along with excellent and attentive service staff with special thanks to Roziana for making our day. Located in the midst of Orchard, 10@claymore is a hide-out on its own. Had a comfortable family lunch and will definitely be back again
5
As always, 10@Claymore never failed to delivered an excellent food quality and its service quality.Kudos to all chefs and service staffs
5
The best ever 5 star hotel service staff whom does not only bring out elegance but also the fun side which is rare to find as 5 star service staff always quiet but she really bring out the vibe.. the atmosphere which on saturday lunch was quiet and dull, she bring it out by singing Happy Birthday Daddy! Great job Miss Roziana.Will come here for birthday celebration
5
Top on the list is Chef Andy's scrumptious chat kway Teow which tastes even better than Gurney Drives' . The seafood spread was fresh n delightful. The dessert spread was another huge plus. The Oreo cheese cake, the durian crepe, the lemongrass ice-cream... are just heavenly. The service is superb too! Service with winsome smiles!!
5
Chef Andy's Char Kway Teow has achieved gestronomical perfection. The combination of crunchy beansprouts, fresh prawns, and succulent cockles is a pleasure that i will forever remember. The amount of oil used is just right- enough to make the noodles slurp through your lips with ease, yet without leaving an oily after taste that lingers in your mouth. The aroma of the char kway teow alone is incredibly unique. You can just smell the wok that it the noodles are fried in. Will definitely be back for more
5
Was here on a Friday night for the dinner buffet. The dinner included a wide spread of seafood and meats, and oysters from different countries. Especially worth mentioning is Chef Andy Oh's char kway tiao, the prawns and crab meat really compliments the smoky taste of the fried noodles. Service staff were cheerful and pro active, by the time I had come back from getting more food, empty plates were automatically cleared. Would come again.
5
Love this place! Such a quality buffet, and a significant wide selection for fish, meat & vegetarians. Being a big seafood fan I dive straight 4 the fresh oysters (6 different types) followed by sashimi, lobster tail, shrimp and so on. They also have a selection of freshly cooked taster dishes from around the world. If only my belly could fit more. Nice ambiance & lovely staff - not to be missed!
5
This is my third visit and I can hardly wait until the next one. This place gives a whole new meaning to the words "buffet restaurant". All the food is prepared with passion and the buffet displays an array of scents and tastes. You can enjoy all you can eat from the buffet as well as some small a la carte dishes you can order at the table. The quality of the food is of a consistently high standard throughout all dishes and the seafood buffet is simply to die for. My tip: take your time and try little bits of food at a time and enjoy a wide variety of options. If you love fresh oysters from around the globe, beautiful sashimi and lobster tail than this is the place for you
5
Visited the restaurant a few days ago, and it was one of the best buffets I've ever been to. My family and I were greeted with an amazing spread of fresh seafoods and desserts. The head chef Andy Oh was walking around and checking on all the guests in the restaurant. Had a splendid taste of their well-known Penang char kway teow as well. The staff were attentive and all smiles; needless to say, my family and I would definitely be back again
5
Dined at 10@Claymore. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. The buffet spread was amazing and we had the most succulent beef ever. The restaurant is known for their Penang char kway teow; specially done by Chef Andy Oh himself. Be sure to order one! The ambience was of utmost comfort; definitely one of the best restaurants and hotels I've visited
4
Another success in this lovely hotel. We had breakfasts here but also one night had the seafood buffet. A huge amount of great food for 80 Singapore dollars. Really good.
5
delicious choc croissants, individualized omelettes, lovely fresh salads with fab walnuts to add, artichokes, mushrooms & fresh fruit perfectly ripe especially papaya & pineappl
5
Visited the restaurant on two occasions in one week. The spread at sunday brunch was superb with excellent service. The head chef was walking around checking on all his customers and taking in all their feedback in stride. Was there at the restaurant for their lunch buffet and experienced the same standard of service although the spread and quality was not as great as the one offered for brunch
5
Food full of whimsical choice from starter to dessert , especially beef angus and oysters is feshly serve by chef. most relaxing place to dine .Service team and chef is friendly treat us like an family dinning in restaurant . Awesome experience 
5
Went here for our friends gathering at last Saturday night. The food are delicious and the environment is quite comfort, especially the Waiter Kevin and Waitress Shin Yie are very kind and provide the good service. Will come to have dinner again for my next Singapore trip
5
I have been to buffet with my best friends. The food was definitely great , there was lots of fresh seafood (lobster , big prawn , scallop and etc) . Service was great especially the staff kevin who gave us very good service and very polite. Moreover, one of the chef Andy who cooked very delicious "char koay teow " for us. Will visit again if going to singapore
5
There are variety of delicious food served and we are really enjoy our buffet.Besides, all your staff are really friendly and kindness especially kelvin, chef Andy, chef Eric, shin yie. we will come back again
5
The staff members at 10 Claymore are very attentive. They see to details like bringing my toddler a straw for his juice. of particular mention is Cindy who took the trouble to walk me downstairs to show me where the exit to Orchard Tower is. Food variety is good especially the durian crepe
5
I went with a group of non-vegetarian friends for lunch. As it was not a vegetarian restaurant, I was not expecting much (expecting bread, salad and dessert). To my surprise, the staff offered both Indian and Chinese vegetarian, although these are not on the menu. I took the Chinese option. They gave me fried rice, celery with vege prawn, mushrooms with sauce and vege meat. The fried rice was good, but the celery in particular was very well cooked. The mushroom went well with the sauce. The vege meat was average, but I am never a great fan of vege meat
4
The hotel is a little out of the Orchard stretch. Seafood selection was not much for weekday lunch and the wagyu beef was not on the menu. However, I should say that I am happy with the spread. The beef available was NZ tenderloin, OK for me.. They did Penang dishes very well. The recommended Char Kuay Tiao and Penang Laksa was good but my fave was the Penang prawn noodle. The soup base was very rich and the chilli added much punch to the noodle. Rest of the spread are good to have.. but did not really touch on those. Service was excellent, very attentive. All in, good for a leisure, quiet lunch with partner
5
10@Claymore is probably as underrated as it can be. Situated in Orchard, it's often overshadowed by the more mainstream names, which I have no idea why. This restaurant serves the best variety of food compared to a lot of hotels in Singapore I've visited with their chef constantly coming up with seasonal dishes that you can order from the service staff. Their Canadian oysters are really juicy and fresh and the quality of food makes it really value for money. Usually you'd need to make a reservation but it's not overly crowded so you'll enjoy the serenity especially for dates
5
Brought my sisters and nephew for dinner last week and boy I have to say that the food and service were excellent! Seafood were fresh and tasty, especially the Alaskan King Crab and sashimi! We truly appreciate Firah, one of the staff for recommending us child-friendly dishes for my nephew as some of the dishes at the buffet were spicy. Jeremy, the restaurant manager was also very attentive towards us, ensuring we are well taken care of. The must-have for the dinner buffet is the Durian crepe. Gosh it was amazing! Looking forward to coming back again :
5
During my recent visit to Singapore and I had my dinner in your 10@Claymore. Once my foods were served, the aromas of the foods started to tickle my taste buds. When I begin to eat, I felt it was not only delicious but also amazing and craving. The Oyster (one of the specials that night) they were heavenly. I feel that, it is worth throwing a party for my friends in your hotel in near future. Safeguard the secrets of your amazing recipes and the radiance discovery of your Chef Mr. Andy. Your staffs in the F & B Department Mr. Kevin, Ms. Kavitha Mr. Aidil and Mr. Jaka deserve a big THANK YOU and a pat on their shoulder for the great hospitality shown to the guest and the marvelous food served. I’m very thankful to your F&B Manager Mr. Jay, who comes down all the way to assist his staff . This shows the quality of a team leader. Thank you for an exquisite meal and very much appreciated the splendid service. Keep up with the wonderful service. Cheer
4
Had a family lunch at Easter and the restaurant was extremely quiet for a public holiday. It wasn't even half filled but I wasn't complaining as it meant we had lots of attention from the wait staff and plates were cleared quickly.Food selection wasn't very wide but the quality was great so no complaints there as well.If you're looking for a quiet buffet restaurant, this is the place to come
4
Hidden away from the main highlights of Orchard Road in Singapore, '10 at Claymore' offers a quality buffet through the freshness and variety of seafood offered. Although the overall buffet range is not extensive compared to other restaurants, what is on offer is very good quality
4
Staff were friendly, attentive and warm. Food were fresh and delicious. Service counters which have chiefs standing by to cook the food on the spot gave a personal touch to diners. There are also menu for special order. Buffet spread catered to many cultures of diners. Well done
4
This is my second visit to 10 at Claymore, and I must say that I was very impressed by the food selection and the great serviceThere was a lot on offer from seafood, to hot food, and desserts as wellI can't think of anything that I really wanted that wasn't present in the food selectionBut best of all, I really appreciate the fine service that was shown to my family and myself.We were attended to by a Mr Kevin, and he was polite and very efficient.Being in the service industry myself, I'm very satisfied with both the level of service and the quality of the food at "10 at Claymore
1
I ate here for three days in a roll - two meals a day - breakfast and lunch.It's fine for one day, but eating here consecutively means there is no variation or change in the menu. They served the same salad for breakfast and then again for lunch (but there was kimchi for lunch). The manager, a woman in a jacket/suit, was not very friendly. She hardly smiled and was not very service-minded. It seemed like everything she did bothered her and I felt I was annoying her when I ordered my coffee.The manager also didn't ensure that the counters were clean as there was food that someone spilled but she (and the other waitresses) just ignored it. I went for breakfast on the second day and had a scrambled eggs. The eggs were horrible and didn't look like scrambled eggs. Plus, there was no ketchup! The cook (an old man) said that the manager had not put out the ketchup or decided not to serve ketchup that day, and only hot sauce was available. I could not enjoy my eggs without ketchup and was very upset. The other days, there was ketchup, but it was of very poor quality. Instead of service it in bottles, the restaurant use a large bowl and pours all the ketchup in that bowl in order to save money. The restaurant has a very limited selection of food and nothing was appealing. The service was horrible because they were understaffed so it took a long time to get served (for drinks) and for plates to be cleared). The servers don't smile, don't say
5
what trip advisor reviewers have said is true!Awesome buffet, with everything from lobster and sashimi to wagu beefNever had better.Finished with great ice cream.Waddled out, and will return
4
Went back there for buffet dinner again and the restaurant did not disappoint me with their delicious spread and freshness. The chef heard that I love desert and he prepared a macaroon and tart for me. The nice thought made my day
5
excellent food! good choice of variety, fresh and good ingredients. on top of it all, staffs were all courteous and attentive. awesome service. Have been here a couple times. and I'll always have a little chat up with their staff. good job Chef Eric! *do not be shy if you have any dietary preference/if you are not feeling well, they'll customize something for you!
4
I celebrated my birthday here. The spread is fantastic! I love the angus beef, sashimi, half lobster and snow crab best. The salad could be improved though, rather small selection of greens.A good round off was a cup of specialty tea ranging from a mix of osmanthus, sencha, rose, Earl grey, mint and more. Absolutely memorable
5
I have to say I was very impressed with the food and service at 10 at Claymore. Regarding food, I particularly enjoyed the black angus steak, fresh oysters, sushi, and the lobsters that were plentifully prepared for guests to freely take to their tables and eat, and also the "pleasure of plates (small al la carte menus)" which we were able to order from our tables at no extra charge. Regarding service, I was very pleased by the attentitive waiters/waitresses (I particularly remember a few extraordinary individuals: Dally, Serena, Kevin..) who were always around to clear our dishes and ask if we needed any help. The chefs standing by at the food tables were also very helpful, not to mention the managers who occasionally came around to ask if everything was fine. I would definitely recommend this place to couples or families who are looking for a great meal
4
I know her (on picture) her name Ariel Oh right???
Than i remember the good person, he is Eko. Always smile... Althought he was tired
Hehe
4
What a delight to have a buffet breakfast at this restaurant! Such friendly service, nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with a smile. The food was amazing, huge variety ranging from fried noodles to eggs cooked on the spot exactly how you request them. My husband and I will definitely be having breakfast here again.
5
Visited the restaurant on a weekend with family. The foods and service are excellent. Thanks to all staffs who provide excellent service.
5
Good and efficient service! All staff were attentive, including those chef who were at the live station! Food were great
5
Great meal experience with personal touch from Chef Andy... My personal fav was the 1855 tenderloin... The selection was good for lunch especially when we need to remember that we still have to work afterwards..
5
I was there on 2 occasions to celebrate CNY Lo Hei with family and colleagues. The ambience was great, ideal place for group that has different yearning as they serve both east-west cuisines. Staffs were friendly, attentive and personalized. Must try Chef Andy specialties Char Kway Teow and Beef Tenderlion
5
Was in restaurant for lunch with colleagues for the Lunar New Year Lo Hei. Good quiet ambience. Varieties of food is amazing and well spaced out.The tenderloin beef was just right and delicious. Service staff were attentive and make you feel welcome. Best of all was Chef Andy personal touch in his interactions with the diners and preparing his specialities
5
It was an awesome lunch with my colleagues and i always keep coming back! Fantastic food with fantastic company makes for a great restaurant. 10 at Claymore will always be my top choice for a buffet!! A definite must eat
5
Great value, great location, excellent staff. Outstanding service, excellent facilities, great Club loung
5
If you are loooking for nice place to eat, here we go. I am totally like this place and come back many times
5
The Christmas buffet is good, with a lot to choices so is the breakfast, both international and Asian, but could be better if the cost is less.
5
The food was great. The staffs were very accommodating and attentive. Thank you Mr. Jeremy Gomes, Kavitha and the rest of the staffs for the assistance all throughout the night
5
We had the pleasure of eating here and cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant! Service was really good. One of the staffs were very attentive and constantly checked on us whether we were satisfied with the food and service. The staff gave a brilliant orientation brief upon ushering us to our table. The food was varied and hot/cold as required and constantly plentiful. We will be back again! Good job to all service team
5
We went there for the first time, the atmosphere was amazing, and all the staff are smiling and seem to be happy to be working there. Nawetbardzo food is ok, not too expensive and served in very generous portions. The dessert was good, wonderfully tasty
4
The spread contains chinese dishes , japanese dishes , indian dishes as well as continental dishes. The egg station was efficiently manned , freshly cut fruits as well as excellent cold cuts , cereals , salads with cheese ......the list goes on
2
Was celebrating my gf birthday on the night, reservation booked through website and confirmed that a cupcake with 'Happy Birthday' wording will be prepared for my gf upon dine in. However, waited until we get the bill, nothing was served. Food that ordered from the menu was cold during serving. Chefs that standby at the counter is friendly and always offer assistance to others. Through my observation. there is 1 male indian staff that is wearing a black jacket (I guess Restaurant Manager or F&B manager?) only pay attention to the Caucasian rather than any locals over in the restaurant. Restaurant ambience is good and cosy. Overall, the ground staffs did a fantastic job in ensuring plate has been cleared on time, and assistance was offered at said timing
5
Food was unbelievable. Fresh oysters and really tender Angus beef. Everything was good. Should try if you are visiting Singapore. Service was however a little slow. Short handed.
5
My self as a chef from Australia, I impress with their service and quality of food. It was great experience, Im thanking for the all hard working chef, especially chef Eric, who has high strength on customer relation And run the buffet nicely. I really preciate of food and service, i will definitely come back.
5
This restaurant has one of the best value buffet dinner. It offers quality food and the variety at the buffet table is just enough without being overwhelming. We love the three different kinds of raw oysters, lobsters and other seafood. We also like the small portion of meat which we could order and reorder if we like it. An enjoyable dining experience without putting us off buffet food
5
I love those items you could order off the menu and they are part of the buffet! Penang char kway tiao and salmon in chilli sauce (like the chilli crabs sauce)! I was there to celebrate my bf ' s birthday on a Tues and was surprised to find live oysters from 2 different countries, baby lobsters, crayfish and other seafood. There is also a good selection of sashimi, warm cooked food as well as desserts. I would recommend this buffet to anyone who wants to have dinner at a more intimate and quiet setting
5
We celebrated our company christmas dinner at 10@claymore last month and we really enjoyed the food A LOT! Lobsters, prawns, oysters, sashimi, dessert everything! It is truly worth every penny you will spend. The service crew especially Mr. Jay greeted us with a warm smile as soon as we come in and checks every table if everything is okay. It is a very good gesture indeed! All of us were truly had an awesome night and surely will come back again anytime soon

Actually, after finished the lunch time I visited the 10at claymore. The staffs look so busy for cleaning the table. So ,I was hasitated to entered the restaurant. But hostess Dally greeted me ,and she listened attentively. Me and myhubby ordered Grilled lamb and Chaw kew teaw. Thank you for the food. We really loved it. This helps to ensure the food served is piping hot and fresh!Thoroughly enjoyed our hours there. WIll be back here soon.

We have eaten at Edge about 10 times and at all the Vegas buffets several times. 10 at Claymore is one of the best! I think the gentlemen's name was Jay but not sure, but he was so friendly and pleasant. The entire staff was nice and professional. The buffet is small but the seafood and meat was one of the best quality and taste I've had at a buffet or restaurant. Not sure if I just missed it being out but had to ask waiter to bring melted butter and he did so quickly. My favorites were the oyster with horseradish and lobster claws. My husband loved the steak which they cooked to his liking- rare. Our son liked the noodle dish from the menu. Enjoyed this place so much made a reservation for my birthday. Can't wait

Wide range of food with excellent quality and good taste. Service crews very attentive and very friendly
5
We like the restaurant environment, food and service, especially for the dessert, there are lots of choice for you to pick

I had a pleasant experience at 10 at Claymore on Sunday 28 December 2014. My son and his future wife treated my wife and me to brunch. It was our post-Christmas meal and hosted by them for a special reason. The freshness of the food is all there to be savoured, tasted, enjoyed and eaten. For starters, we shared a dozen oysters from France. We shared sashimi - swordfish, tuna and salmon. We ordered sample portions of the restaurant's signature dishes, namely foie gras, sautéed pork belly, award-winning char kway teow, assam laksa, and prawn noodles. We then tried the crayfish, Alaskan crab legs, prawns - all steamed. For cooked food, we sampled the honey-baked ham, roast turkey, fried pepper chicken, and fried pepper crabs. There was free flow of juices: a choice of orange, pineapple or grapefruit or a mix of them. Black coffee and Capucinno, together with log cake, chocolate pudding, mango ice cream and Durian crepe filled our tummies just right. At S$88++, it was value for money. Most importantly, freshness of food is guaranteed. We were indeed satisfied customers of 10 at Claymore and vow to return to this restaurant to eat again

We ate here only the once on our last day & it was simple, easy & tasty. Compared to other options we found this a reasonably priced option
5
The food was quite impressive and the staffs are friendly and courteous which made the whole dinner pleasant. As I am a dessert person, I tried most of them and found that it was great especially the durian crepe. Chef Eric gave a general briefing on the food and the generous filing of durian on the crepe compliments my day. Yumyum
5
This is the first time I have ever visited this restaurant. I was surprisingly by the look and arrangement of Buffets. So many good foods which are high quality and very good tasting including another menu which are not on the buffet table and you can ordered. It was a very enjoyable buffet I have ever had since I am not a person who fancy Buffet much. You much try the cheeses and Oysters which are not much varieties but very high quality and so specialized. If you have planned to come to this restaurant, advance booking is required for sure

overall the food is fresh and taste good but the steamed seabass is rather bland.the dessert are of great variety and the prawn mee taste best.the staff are friendly and helpful especially salina and dally who try to take care my grandchild's needs.Due to festive season the restaurant short manpower so the clearing the plate is quite slow.I nave been here for lunch many time and find that the standard of the food had improved.thumb up chef

I've been to many restaurants in Singapore. This restaurant impressed me a lot. The buffet line is attractive. The seafood are fresh and the roast food also taste good. From the A La Carte menu, I love the prawn noodle and chili salmon, especially the Char Kway Teow!!! For the dessert, as far as I am concerned, you can't miss the green tea tiramisu and the crepe!! There is always a very long queue in front of the crepe. The staff are friendly and helpful. I will recommend this restaurant to my family and my friends
3
The breakfast was nice enough but variety and quality pales in comparison to the Edge (formerly Global Kitchen) at Pan Pacific in Marina Square
5
Our stay in Singapore was just a couple of days so we met up with some old friends for brunch, and what a brunch it was.The location is great, just in the heart of the shopping action, and the decor is very nice as well.But the thing you come for is the food, and trust me it is good, very good.The choice of high quality seafood and meat is just amazing. You can pick from different types of sashimi, to fresh oysters, scallops or lobster, just to name a few.The meat selection is as impressive as well, from roasted beef, to duck or fois gras, and you have a very nice selection of a la cart opitions included as well.What can I say, just go there when you are hungry and enjoy every second of it
5
It was a great explore of new taste as well as cosy restaurant to be in. I felt so relax being in the restaurant; warm lighting and soothing music from the lounge made it even wonderful. Of course , not forgetting the food! I've order the Oysters (super fresh!) Crepes (crispy and delicious with durian paste) Tenderloin (soft, tender & juicy).Note: The service is excellent! That's the most important to me when i visit any restaurants. All the service staff are very warm and friendly! Big thanks to the restaurant manager Jay who took the initiative and volunteered to take a family photo and his warm approach. I definitely will visit agai

Today is my family's first time trying the Sunday brunch at this hotel, as we made a reservation early in the morning. There is a lot of seafood: oysters, sashimi, salmon, crab and lobster, though my husband complained that the lobster was not so fresh, and he couldn't explain what was wrong, just that the taste sounded weird. Glad that the food to be ordered from the menu, their price is also included in the brunch, unlike some other hotels which charged separately. However, their portion is just way too small. My mom suggested that since they can all be ordered indefinite number of times, with the exception of lobster, why not just put them in the buffet section? The variety of food is also great: salad, a lot of main courses, and also wagyu beef, though the beef could have been slightly better cooked, to medium well done, as the one that I had seemed to be a bit bloody. Their cheese selection is also pretty special, with a type of cheese chili cheese, which my mom took a few. As my mom asked for the bill, the waitress returned her the receipt and credit card in an envelope specially made by the hotel. This showed how thoughtful the waitress was. Overall, a good experience, and very likely to go back again in the near future
5
The food selection is generous and the quality of each kind of cuisine is amazing cooked in the way that makes you go for again and again because it is just so delicious , and the environment is excellent for family gathering
5
I tried 10 @ claymore for the first time with my daughter today. It was simply fantastic. I would like to thank chef wen siang for specially giving my daughter and I chocolate ice-cream and the sushi chef (can't recall his name) as well for preparing sushi that we love! The manager sulaiman and cashier Kavitha was also very attentive. The food is scrumptious I would definitely return very soon! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone :)
5
I love the food especially the fresh oysters and lobsters. The aka carte menu was good as well. I tried the beef and lamb. Both tasted good. My friend's birthday was on the day I visited the restaurant. Out of my expectation, the chef prepared us a cup cake with a candle! Love the ambiance and food. My second time of visit there and will surely go again 
5
I didn't stay at hotel but went for dinner buffet with family, enjoyed the wide variety of local an international delights! Lobby and lounge staff were friendly and welcoming. The hotel lobby looks classy and fantastic after renovation
5
It is one of the best buffet dinner I had. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The buffet line is attractive. The food are fresh and delicious which make this dinner worth the price. Very relaxing atmosphere, suitable for couples and families to dine in
5
Excellent food, friendly chef. Meat and seafood are fresh and tasty. My favourite is the durian crepe, crispy crepe and its rich durian filling is like heaven on earth. Highly recommended
5
While I was about to type 'Best buffet', realisation hit me that it did not feel like any typical hotel buffet, but rather a holistic and fulfilling dining experience that encompasses great food, service, ambience and a chef to remember.Now unlike any other hotel buffet where one would gorge on the free flowing expensive selection such as fresh seafood (don't deny it people), my inclinations were otherwise after I took a walk around and a look at the menu to order. With the much raved about char kway teow and durian crepe just to name a few, I had to plan the space in my stomach wisely.Starting off with the usual, sashimi and seafood. I must say, what I had was really fresh and would I have a bigger stomach, I wouldn't have practiced restraint. Not an oyster lover, in fact, one is the usual number I stop at. I had 3 - the selection was too intriguing for me to deny, and I must say I actually quite enjoyed the 'tasting session', with the help of a friend explaining the variety of course.On to the month's special they were having, the wagyu beef. It was great, but I wouldn't say that was the highlight, because the highlight has to go to what's on the staple menu - the Char Kway Teow. Normally I would dismiss the local selection as they are a waste of space in terms of dollar value, but this Char Kway Teow, you just have to try it. Cooked specially by Chef Andy, it was full of delectable ingredients. Prawns, chinese sausages, crab meat (yes crab meat), they never seem to end every bite I took. But still, that did not take the limelight off the flavour. This is not your typical 'spam plum sauce and taste good' flavour, there was a certain refined balance to the flavours, rich, balanced extremely tasty and with the authentic hawker centre wok fragrance. One would assume the best char kway teow is something you have to queue an hour for, this I would queue and hour and pay $50 for a plate of it.And the surprises doesn't end there. Chef Andy decides to whip out his next month's special (October), the Lobster Trepidor. And mind you, I am no VIP, just another diner on a weekday. I've never tried Lobster Trepidor, neither have I heard of it. On description, I thought it might not be something that I will fancy - The many rich ingredients, not my thing. But after cleaning out the shell, well let's just say I'll be visiting again next month to have more.desserts were good, a very very reasonable selection and without neglecting quality. cakes, cream puffs, I had everything without wastage. The durian crepe was made fresh, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, really rich and natural filling, you don't really get this anywhere.I must say the experience didn't stop with the food. The service staff had great attitude despite the busy night (quite crowded for a weekday I must say). The head chef was very 'on ground' as well, checking up on customers, and even working stations himself. I've tried most of the higher end buffets, and I must say 10@Claymore is the one to beat. Will definitely be visiting and bringing more people along soon enough
5
I love the cosy and welcome ambience here created by friendly staffs and chefs. The most impressive is Chef Andy's Char Kway Teow which just taste amazing. Another highlight is the durian crepe with its rich durian filling and is the best with lemongrass ice cream on top which absolutely fulfilled my cravings
5
Our weekly Saturday lunch is a always a pleasurable experience.My mother and I love Chef Andy's mouthwatering Char Kway Teow which has the right blend of spices and authentic taste. This is a must try dish.The service is excellent. The food is outstanding and the staff are very friendly. Besides the Char Kway Teow, they also have other signature dishes produced by the team of chefs which you must definitely sample. There is also a wide variety of desserts which tantalises the tastebuds and is a perfect end to the meal
5
Was there with my family on a Monday evening.The ambience of the restaurant is good and the buffet spread is quite attractive. Service staff & Chefs are very friendly and helpful. Everyone was very happy after our meal.Personally I am very choosy when coming to cold fresh seafood/food. Their prawns, Sashimi & Oyster are really fresh and I'm delighted. Next would be the "main course". Starting with my favorite meat, Beef. I ordered the Omi Beef and it was one of the best beef I tried beside Kobe beef. Dessert - I tried the Durian Creps is good. With fresh durian fillings. Their cookie is very very delicious can be compared with F.A Thank you for the awesome experience. Highly recommend you guys to try it

It's a wonderful night to have dinner with my family at Claymore. The cold items are very fresh and the Chefs are very friendly as well. They even prepared delicious cooked item as my cousins don't take cold seafood.We also celebrated my mum's birthday at the restaurant. The cake is filled with chocolate flavor and yummy. Thank you everyone for their great hospitality and food. Will definitely visit the restaurant again

Everything starts from a simple phone reservation, whereas I and three of friends enjoyed spending our time at this restaurant during our dinner.Not only that we obtained an pleasurable dining experience that evening, it’s buffet spread was of great quality items such as the fresh Sashimi, Oysters, Wagyu beef, desserts like crepe, ice cream and cake. A rare moment of experience which enable us to able speak to Executive Chef and being offered one of his signature dishes- Penang Char Kway Teow that tasted so good that doubt you can get anywhere else. The complimentary plates of pleasure is definitely an unique add-on to obtain an complete dining experience for all of us. The warm hospitality service given by the Executive Chef Andy, Jayandrran and the server team which is so hard to find nowadays in big hotels.I will definitely be back with my friend and family. Well done & keep it upBest Regards,Mike Lo

I had a really great experience here yesterday with a friend of mine and her parents. We were slightly more troublesome as we repeatedly rang the place up to change our reservation timings, but the hostess who picked up our call was relatively nice about it.The ambience and decor of the place is excellent. Nothing was too hard to find, except perhaps utensils (I had to ask a chef for a teaspoon as I could not find one for my desserts), but this can easily be solved by engaging any of the waiters or even the chefs around the counters.The food quality is excellent! My friend was singing praises of the beef, and I found the seafood to be amazingly fresh. I went back for rounds and rounds of sashimi, and the promptness the chefs showed in engaging and serving with the guests was commendable. I recall an instant when my friend was complaining about how the last lobster was taken away by a gentleman, and upon hearing that one of the chefs immediately went inside to top up the lobsters for us. A simple gesture of hospitality like this goes a long way! Will definitely recommend this to all my friends! :
5
Tonight we booked our dinner at the cafe but was taken aback that we were seated at the entrance. We brought our concerns that we have ladies handbags at the chairs once out of sight might lost it but the service staff explained that it is packed and the seating cannot be chsnged.Happened Andy passed by and heard it, he told us to give him a minute and he will try his best to rearrange the seating.Less than a minute, Andy came back and told us he managed to get a table for 8 of usKudos Andy, he really makes our dinner a great pleasure and everyone of us is enjoying our meal, in addition, the service by all the other staff are fantastic. Good ambience with good food of different countries oysters n generous servings of fresh lobsters. That's the reason why we are back for more than seven occasions. Keep it up!Joy Le

Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday during the weekend with her family together. They even prepared a nice birthday cake for her.The buffet spread was of great quality items such as the Wagyu beef. Ambience was very cozy and define. Selections was just nice and the service was excellent. The associates was very friendly and attentive. Certainly not the usual hotel buffet you would expect. 10 at Claymore is beyond any other 5 star hotels.Thanks to Chef Andy and Jayandrran for the wonderful hospitality
5
I had the privilege to dine in with my family last weekend and boy was it amazing! We chose this place because everyone was raving about the Omi Wagyu Beef and I had to go and try. Oh my, can I tell you it was a melt-in-your-mouth kinda steak. Both my sister and I gave each other a look when we had our first bite, the look where you are taken aback how flipping tantalizing the steak was! *thumbs up* Apart from that we were pleasantly surprise by the freshness of the seafood selection there. Coming from a city where our local seafood is as fresh as it can be, their oysters are so so fresh and juicy! Oh not forgetting the sashimi section they have :D Can't stop going back for more. Last but not least, being an amateur pastry chef myself, I am searching high and low for great desserts in this city. And was pleasantly surprise that at a hotel buffet dinner as such, they serve better than average desserts. The one cake that made me go back for more than I should have, is the Chocolate Brownie. Not sure if it was wrongly labelled but this brownie has a mousse-y texture with an element of crunch. Totally in love with it! x A special shoutout to Chef Andy and Mr. Jay: they came to check on our table to make sure our family dinner is a pleasant one. Chef Andy also recommended us a bottle of red to go along with our meals. At the end of the night, our stomachs and hearts are full. Would definitely come back for more! Keep it up 10@Claymore 
5
For a hotel restaurant this is actually a very nice find. It's chef Chris if is from Penang and we got a chance to speak with him. He makes very nice Penang dishes that can be hard to find in Singapore including laksa ( more delicate and not as spicy as Singaporean laksa) and a refined char kwei teow that is light fresh not heavily oiled. There is also a nice selection of seafood at the buffet. Die die must try :
5
This was my 1st time visited 10@Claymore for lunch buffet with my hubby for our Anniversary celebration. We had an utmost delightful and pleasurable dining experience. The Executive Chef, Andy has prepared assorted sashimi, signature Penang fried kuey tiow & assam laksa for us. He served the foods to us and shared his passionate about cooking the authentic Penang cuisine. I'm totally amaze with his friendly and humble attitute. The lunch buffet comes with complimentary plates of pleasure such as Rojak, Roti Jala, Penang style ngoh hiang,Penang char kueh tiow & Penang assam laksa. All foods are delectable and very authentic. However, i wish seafoods can serve for lunch. The restaurant staffs/waiter & waitress are very friendly and attentive especially waitress, Dally. She was trying her best to explain menu to us. We love the fresh japanese sashimi, desserts/cakes & plates of pleasure foods. We will come back again. Hope they can maintain their standard. Well done & keep it up

The food here is good, but, I've had better. I didn't feel like it had much atmosphere for a start. To many waiters watching while you serve yourself and eat. Very quick to clean your table and take away used plates. Wasn't offered wine and is is weird for me being a top class restaurant. Now for the food. The sashimi was excellent, fresh, moist and good cuts. The oysters, prefer the Aussie oysters by far. These are shucked and bought to your table. The hot food wasn't very hot, I even stired the crabmeat rice and got it from the bottom but was still just warm. The pork ribs also borderline cold. I don't eat much of the hot food as I don't like spicy foods. The desserts, well they are very pleasing on the eye but tend to all be very similar in taste and texture. The one that was nice and different was the passion fruit cake. A Lovely fresh fruit selection, very nice. The crepe I had was like rubber very chewy had to cut quite vigorously with a knife. On saying this, the coriander, mint and ginger ice cream on it was very very good. A great marriage here. I waited three months to get into here. Last time we were in Singapore we couldn't get a booking so this time I booked in advance. I don't think we would come back here. Im pretty sure there are other places that are a tad better. All the time I'm Thinking this place is in the top ten of places to eat but yes, I have had better buffets in Singapore. A little disappointed really. Adding all the taxes and without drinks, at $80 each, little bit price
5
We went with our friends who were regular at restaurant. It was our first time and we were greeted warmly by the servers as well as by Chef Andy. Everyone must try out the Omi Wagyu beef which literally melts in your mouth. For oyster lovers, there are 3 different kinds which you can have unlimited of it. We ended the meal with durian crepes which is so yummy!Highly recommended
4
The food was awesome, it's definitely worth the price. Even though there are not much of varieties. The service that was provided by Andy Oh, Eric Cheam and Paul was definitely delightful. I have been there a few times, and each time I go, I will definitely feel like heading back to the restaurant soon
5
I have visited and had buffet dinner with alot of hotel but I think 10 at claymore has ond of the best buffet experience I ever have. Excellent food quality, service and atmosphere. The food was very very fresh. The best serving was having 3 types of oyster, fresh sashimi and premium omi beef steak
5
This September, the art of Omi promotion was truly phenomenal! The marbling on the beef was so good, the beef literally melted in my mouth. You should have seen the look on my friend's face when he ate the beef. Extreme satisfaction! It was literally one of the best piece of meats i have ever eaten in my life. Perfectly seasoned and cooked. I would recommend everyone to eat it medium rare. I am soooo going back again next week! :) FANTASTIC PROMOTION. can't wait to see what is coming out in October. Chef Andy, keep up the great work! The quality of the items and the perfection of the dishes make it completely worth going back each time
5
Fresh seafood and delicious wagyu beef! The quality of the spread is top notch. Excellent service! Chef was friendly 
5
It's crazy, the amount of spread and the great service quality. Came in a group of 8, was seated promptly and presented to a excellent spread. Kudos to the wagyu beef and the steak & mash (which you can order, unlimited times). The lobster was fresh too! Do not forget to try the Penang Char Kway Teow, the wok hei is superb!Will definitely come again
5
Went with a group of 8 friends. Food was excellent, in particular the oysters. Ambience was really chill and suitable for either a date night or just for gathering. Chef was really friendly and came to chat with us.Overall an amazing experience and the best buffet I have eaten. Definitely come back again
5
My family and I visited 10 at Claymore after serveral recommendation by friends. Excellent service and 3 choices of Oysters, Wagyu breef and lot of other spread. Highly recommended
4
The spread may be limited but this is not a big deal as the quality of the food was excellent and we enjoyed the attentive service. Highlights were the 6 types of oysters and the angus beef, but the other dishes were pretty decent too. Special mention to the small but specially prepared plates of local hawker delights. The lobsters were however way overcooked until they were tough and chewy, but this was not a showstopper. Overall, we enjoyed this buffet very much as the restaurant was not so large that everything became mass-produced, impersonal and frantic
5
I'm very happy about the food and service provided to my boyfriend and I. This was the second time I visit this restaurant, the service was excellent, chef were all friendly and staff shin, Paul and Roy was very friendly and attentive. I appreciate and feel grateful for making my boyfriend's birthday a memorable one. Food were awesome and lots of variety. Beef were awesome n lots of variety on dessert as well as having an unique favor of ice cream~

i make a reservation on 26aug for the dinner buffet, was one of the first to arrive for the dinner everything was good, especially the oysters and im quite amazed they offered a few varieties which most hotel buffets dont till it came to the sashimi especially the salmon and maguro sashimi i wasnt expecting top notch quality but both the quality of the salmon and maguro sashimi is totally unacceptable, salmon was not fresh at all and the maguro reeks of sour taste and this is not meant to be served for sashimi or either for consumption to the customersi do know its being kept for more than 1.5 days or either its a bad batch of fish send by the supplierfor the chef in charge maybe its not a big deal but if it happens in a japanese restaurant its totally unacceptable and could even cause food poisoning and yes this is that serious when it comes to sashimi why wont i make such a statement? because im a sushi chef myselfim just so utterly dissapointed after spending over 70plus dollars and to expect such quality of sashimi that is not edible at all other than that I am very impressed by the stupendous service provided by your staff(waitress
5
We celebrated my sister and my daughter's birthday there and service was excellent with Alson and Shin who presented birthday cupcake to them. The oysters and beef were great. A great place to hv dinner
5
A place for oysters lover!Their steaks are awesome as well as their spread of cheese and desserts! The service attendant named Chermaine is extremely polite and helpful
4
Yesterday was my second time heading back here to dine as we really like ur durain crepes, 5-6 choices of fresh oysters & of coz the beef (The taste is still in my mind,recommended to try the beef in medium doness, juices n tenderness, fantastic! Even if u worry abt too bloody, nt worry the sauce actually covers the blood taste).They have very good n friendly staffs (esp chef Eric & chef Jasmine). They both still remember us n welcome us back with their excellent friendly smile despite their long n tiring day at work.. very professional... one of the manager(didnt remember the name but he is executive mgt of resturant, bervage & events) actually esort us down from the resturant to level 1 to show us where the nearest path to mrt.looking forward to be back there again
4
We celebrated my girlfriend's birthday at 10 at Claymore. Our servers for the day was Alson and Chermaine , attentive and friendly. They arranged for a cupcake with a birthday note. Awesome oysters and the beef was done just right. 8.5/10 will go back
5
This is actually my second visit to 10@Claymore for dinner. The first time I came was together with my friends after hearing and reading many good reviews of this restaurant. One would be spoilt with choice as there's a wide variety of food to choose from. We definitely had a good experience dining at 10@claymore with the sumptuous spread of food from the eye catching seafood bar which includes lobsters, scallop in shells, oysters, sushi, sashimi to the buffet line spread and also not forgetting the ‘Plates of Pleasure’, unlimited servings in petite portions that’s available in addition to the choice of buffet spread.Given that most of the food in a buffet is prepared beforehand, it’s always refreshing to see the chef preparing some of the food on the spot as such as the amazingly delicious beef and crepes.Besides all the good food that we had, I was amazed by the service given to us as well.Their customer service was extraordinary. The service was consistent and fast despite the restaurant being so busy. Food and drinks were delivered over as soon as we ordered. Great atmosphere, good food and impeccable service. I was so overwhelmed by their hospitality. Good things are meant to be shared and this time I've decided to bring my family over for dinner. I was so glad they enjoyed the dinner so much that my parents cannot stop emphasizing how delicious and fresh the food were. My dad even says this is by-far the best restaurant he had been after so long and will definitely return again.This is no doubt a great place for families and anyone that is a fussy eater as there are a wide spread of food for you to choose from.10 @ Claymore continues to be one of my preferred buffet locations with its high quality grubs
5
Few days back me and my friends having dinner with our's girlfriend at this buffet restaurant. The food there was good especially the oyster the are variety of choice to choose. Although we are just normal guest chef andy himself made us his signature dish. The taste of the food? I will leave that as a superb. One more thing that is good about this restaurant its cheap. i must say this restaurant is a must try!!
5
Thank you for the food (: the beef and oysters were so good. We really loved it. The ala-carte concept is so unique as well. This helps to ensure the food served is piping hot and fresh! Been to numerous hotel buffets including carousel and basilicco but 10 at claymore was the best amongst them all! Thank you very much for making our anniversary so special and shutouts to Chermaine for her patience and help.Thoroughly enjoyed our 3 hours there. WIll be back here soon for the new menu promotions if possible! The 1855 beef and 6 oysters promotion was really very good
5
Dined in at 10 @ claymore on a busy friday night without reservation and the host willingly arranged a table for my friends and I. Although I still recommend you to call and make reservation.The buffet area looks small but we were pleasantly surprise how much their spread can offer. Aside from the seafood corner with prawns, scallops, lobsters, oysters and mussels they also have a sushi bar and live cooking stations for steak and crepes. But wait there's more, they have a menu they call "plates of pleasure" which is part of your dining buffet as well. The plates of pleasure is cooked upon ordering just like an ala carte. LOVE LOVE the char kway teow and the steak and the chefs smiling while cooking and opening oysters for you. Felt like Ive eaten breakfast lunch and dinner in one seating! If you're looking for an amazing dinner with friends or family. 10 @ claymore is definitely the restaurant to visit
5
Alson is a patience and attentive staff even though the cafe is short handed and make our birthday celebration a memorable one. Good ambience good food kudo
5
I dined here tonight with my cousin and my friends and we just had the ultimate dining experience. The buffet had an array of selection from appetizer to dessert! I was already full with the lobster and the sushi! I just had to eat more! The beef was crazy good! It was so tender plus, they cook it live! :) chefs were very courteous and friendly! Service with a smile indeed!!! Service staff as well were attentive and pleasant. Hot dishes were a delight and the plates of pleasure was just awesome! The char kway teow killed it! It's a must try at 10 at claymore. Let's not forget the dessert buffet! Felt like i was in heaven already! Dining here is such an experience. You are able to get your money's worth! I would definitely recommend 10 at Claymore to everyone in a heartbeat. Thank you for a wonderful evening. All the best! :

I had the dinner there 2 days ago with my dad and brother. The food was great from the appitizer to the desert. The staff is courteous, helpful, and friendly.We started off with some lobster which went really well with the Thai chili sauce. Next, we ordered 2 oysters from France. They were fresh and well chucked - retained the water inside which is the secret to good oyster. The lamb alacarte buffet in the menu was really good too. The lamb is soft and blended nicely with the sauce. The main dish was the BBQ pork rib which went really well with the grilled pineapple. The highlight of the meal was the 1855 Angus beef. The meat was incredibly tender. It melted in my mouth. A must try. We ended the meal with Lemongrass Ice-cream (don't try the chocolate), bread pudding, and crepe (they have durians too).Our service staff was Charmaine. Even though she was just there for 4 days (part time), she was extremely polite. My dad was surprised that a part timer can do a job this well. She was very helpful and active - always filling our water everytime it runs low.All in all. Good food, great service. Will definitely go back
5
Located along Claymore Road, 10 @ Claymore is a little gem nestled in the outskirts of Singapore's prime shopping district, Orchard Rd.The food was Double-D: Decadent & Delicious. The 1855 Angus Beef was soft and tender. The seafood selection, ranging from lobsters, scallops to freshly-shucked oysters, were fresh and rich in flavour. The dessert was no lackey either - the freshly-made durian crepes were smothered with generous but sinful scoops of fresh durian.Further, the service staff were ever so warm, friendly and attentive. In particular, Alson and Chermaine were ever ready to attend to us, clear our plates, refill our drinks and even made recommendations on the dishes to arrow in on. Coupled with the warm and quiet ambience, 10 @ Claymore has been a sparkling celebration of the Seventh anniversary of the relationship between my fiancee and I. 10 @ Claymore has certainly left me clamouring for more

My family and I were very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the buffet spread. Items that you'd imagine to be below par because it's been put out at a buffet turned out to be surprisingly good - the kurobuta pork schnitzel with sauerkraut was a prime example.Oysters shucked on demand and the Angus beef are undoubtedly the stars of the show, but you'll find yourselves piling on more from what's on offer.Actually, I'd even be happy just ordering a plate of the restaurant's legendary Char Kuay Teow

Yesterday night, 7 Aug 2014 my friends and i were at the restaurant. The food was great except that i missed my bamboo clamps but your Chef did explained that it was not fresh. I agreed with your Chef that if the food is not fresh it should not be served. But the most important thing was the great service by this Waitress Ms Chermaine. Most Waiters and Waitresses do good services but Chermaine did it with her heart and provide us with her great smile and warmth. She also could remember what drink (tea) i took and served us professionally. I am touched by her Great Service and her ever lasting warm smile. That's was a great dinner for us.rgds,Richard TanGeneral SecretaryHDB Staff Unio

Service staff Eugene , station cooks and generally all staff are very attentive and polite! Cozy ambience and suitable for entertainment .
5
My friends including myself, we 8 person went for their buffet dinner. Foods were nice. 6 types of oysters were so fresh! Services were very good & staffs were very helpful & friendly especially one of their chef named "Lai Seng" who is so hardworking serving us. Will return again for sure
5
Great service, Excellent choice & even better quality!!An all-round fantastic dining experience.I highly recommend this to everyone coming to Singapor
5
What truly amazed me here was not only the food, but the excellent service provided by the butlers and chefs. Their grooming and dressing sense was impressive, and the staff there made me feel like I was truly dining in luxury! The executive chef provided a lot of entertainment, jokes, and topped it all off by letting us taste the absolutely delicious, medium rare Black Angus beef steak by 1855. The Char Kway Teow and Assam Laksa, which is "his mother's" recipe were simply amazing; it tasted exotic and had a different flavor than what you'd normally get at hawker centres

Excellent food, especially different type of Oyster.Really enjoy it.Thank chef Andy Oh and his staff for your kindly service

This restaurant was one of the best I have had in a while. We had a party of 16 for dinner and the food there was simply divine. Starting off with the buffet spread, the first thing that caught my eye were the fresh oysters yet to be shucked sitting temptingly in baskets, with a variety fit for a king, ranging from Australia to France and the USA. - accompanied by a splendid platter of delicious sashimi, sushi and assorted meats - good quality Lamb and beef. The oysters were heavenly and indeed, there were such variety of fantastic cuisine that it was tough to decide on what to feast on.The iconic local char kway teow did justice to its award and the Penang Laksa is definitely THE BEST in town. Chef Andy, Chris and team from Penang are truly a gift sent to bless the foodies in S'pore. Desserts were just as memorable with the banana & nutella crepe - special mention also for the macha and red bean cake - lovely touch. The service was outstanding and everyone was so attentive and smiling. Friendly waiters and waitresses were cheerfully clearing our plates even as we continue to pile on and on. So many highlights, no end to a most enjoyable meal with lovely coffee & tea to accompany the ginger & lemon grass ice cream, crème brulee and almond jelly. To top it all off, the entire meal was extremely satisfying & worth every cent - a value-for-money destination! Highly recommended for any acclaimed FOODIE! & special thanks for Chef Andy & yes! we will be back for more as soon as we have shed the kilo that we put on
5
Durian crepe was fantastic. Wonderful spread of choice. The 6 type of oyster were great and sashimi was fresh. Worth the value
5
It been many I had enjoy my dineer over here. It giving a nice food and service for everytime I visit. Its nice restaurant for come to have your great food and the enviroment
5
Excellent food and service , especially 6 type of oyster.Really enjoy it. Best buffet in the town.Thanks Chef Andy for your professional service and kindly service
5
Wow i am here again,this is third time i came,this time come to try the oyster this time got some new oyster to try.the food still maintain the standard yummy and awesomeService is great and the all of the chef is so friendly.i will recommended more of my friend
3
Can not understand why such high ratings. Basically just a standard buffet with a few add on's which we're disappointing ... Dry and overlooked pork snitzel and half a duck sausage. Deserts look good but lacked flavour
5
Went for the dinner buffet yesterday with a group of friends and had such a fulfilling meal! Seafood was really fresh - the Boston lobsters were really meaty! Loved that they offered such thick cuts of salmon sashimi and the chef actually cuts it on the spot upon your request. Am not really an oyster person but the french oyster tasted really good and doesn't leave a weird after-taste like most oysters i've tried before. If you're a cheese-lover, do remember to try the cranberry cheese and lime and chili cheese...! AND finally my fav dish of the night have to be the durian crepe and lemon grass & ginger icecream!!!!! Had the chance to have a brief chat with the chef who was preparing the crepe and he was telling me that they used the freshest durian without any added sugar. He was also the one who recommended me to eat the crepe together with the lemon grass & ginger icecream - ultimate dessert heaven combination!!! the lemon grass & ginger icecream tasted really refreshing and gives just the right amount of balance to the more flavorful durian crepe.Of course, the rest of the buffet spread is awesome as well (: but since I am a seafood lover I did not have the time to finish trying every single dish there. Would definitely go back again soon! Oh and a really plus point, the chefs at the buffet station are all so friendly! Without a doubt, I had a great night,,,,,!!

the food is amazing! we love it so much! Instead of buffet on spread, you may order some a la minute cooked food from the kitchen as well, its part of the buffet, portion not so big where you can order more different variety of food! we recommend penang delight! you will have the same as what you had, prawn noodle and laksa! ! Service from chef is outstanding, very considerate to bring food to your table when there is a long que on spread! oyster are fresh open, carving station for the pork rack and beef 1855, MUST TRY! !juicy and serve fresh! for service , need to improve...
5
Love the restaurant and food is so yummy.Service is great.I want to go back next year.No disliked
5
We came for the buffet on a weekend for my partner's birthday. We had read about the oyster selection and made a reservation especially for that. It didn't disappoint! Oysters were shucked when chosen which kept them super fresh and they had a small selection of condiments to go with. Fresh cold seafood was a hit with my partner as well as it was amazingly fresh and tasty. Service was pretty alright, it seemed like a very busy night for them but they were very friendly and our water glasses were never empty. The Staff were always smiling and ready to help, coupled with a cozy ambiance, it made for a very fulfilling night
5
She give good recommendations for red wine which I really enjoyed and appreciate it. Nice smiling face make my celebration for my wife birthday a memorial one. Thumps up for her
4
Had dinner with some friends just before weekend.The buffet spread was good with offerings of international varieties, especially the oysters from six different countries, ranging from Australia to France and Canada. There are chefs at the stations to pry open the oysters for you, indicating that it's really fresh from the sea!A good dinner hangout with friends and buddies. Thumbs up
5
Had an indulgent dining experience at 10 at Claymore last week which lasted well over 2 hours. The 6 different kinds of oysters were shucked freshly on demand and were fresh and refreshing, a great start to the buffet. The 1855 Black Angus Prime Beef was seared to a perfect medium-rare, and together with the different sauces like hollandaise, and various kinds of mustards, made for an amazing main course. Not to be missed are other specialties like the "Plates of Pleasure" tasting portions of Prawn Mee and Char Kway Tiao, as well as the wide selection of Boston Lobster and other seafood on Ice and a wide selection of Japanese cusine. For dessert, the soft and fluffly Durian crepe was sweet yet not cloying, while the Lemongrass Ice Cream made for a refreshing end to the meal. I did not get a chance to try all the other food like steamed crabs and other Chinese cuisine - this requires another trip! This restaurant is highly recommended for a relaxing, leisurely meal; come early and take your time to go through all the delightful choices. Don't forget to strike up a conversation with friendly executive chef Andy Oh and team for a wonderful all-rounded experience
5
Visited this place with a group of friends on a Friday evening. The highlight of my meal was the superbly prepared beef, in which the chef attended to every detail, from uniform thickness of each slice, to the plating (bearing in mind this is a buffet, where traditionally many don't bother on plating), and of course the taste ! The spread came accompanied with boston lobster cooked in 3 different ways (Boiled, black pepper, steamed) and 6 kinds of oysters from different parts of the world ! Chef Chris was very knowledgeable on the different dishes, and most courteous to my friends and myself, another plus.Overall, a good experience and a great place to have a nice meal after and unwind after a hectic week. Coupled with great company, one couldn't ask for more :
5
10 at claymore buffet food is excellent! Food are fresh, service are good. I would like to praise chef Andy for his service and good food knowledge that allow to enjoy our dinner at the restaurant. Will return regularly as usual. :

Was anticipating this visit as we had a great meal there when I was pregnant. Been there with my hubby for his birthday celebration on last sunday.This time the service was really extremely slow. Our plates were not cleared and left on the table with our unfilled glasses of water, unfortunately there was one manager that was walking around aimlessly and she didn't even come to our table. And the worst part was we had to wait about 30 minutes for a cup of coffee after having asked the manager which she answered that they will get it in shortly with moody face then she walked away. It's a shame that the restaurant has a beautiful ambiance and it is ruined by the staff that doesn't care about their business.Totally dissappointed
5
I love the cosy and welcoming ambience here created by friendly staffs and chefs. Fresh seafood and there are 6 kinds of oysters. The most impressive is Chef Andy's signature Char Kway Teow which may seem a bit crazy to eat so much during a buffet but I just love it. Another highlight is the durian crepe with its rich durian filling and is best with lemongrass ice cream on top which absolutely fulfilled my cravings!
3
We went there for a business dinner and we chose it because it ranks #5 in Singapore. Iam sorry to say that its ranking is not representative! The quality and variety of food was quite good, especially the oysters and lobster. However, the service is non-existent! We brought our own wine and we had to remind them twice to open it and they didnt even come once to refill our glasses, despite the fact that there is a generous corkage fee. It was a buffett so they had to clear the table from the dishes but every time we would be holding the plates for 1-2 minutes and try to spot a waiter! By the end of the night and as i was trying to ask for a cup of coffee for our guest there were like 5 dirty plates on the table with fish, cheese and cakes - very embarassing
5
We had a big family gathering at 10 claymore brunch. We had a great time there . The food was wonderful compare to other restaurant.
5
My experience here was good. Oysters and seafood here are fresh, friendly chef, staff and good ambiance. The presentation of food and dessert are good too. Love the durian crepe with generous amount of durian.Must try the chef's signature dish- penang char kway teow, highly recommended! Overall experience here was exceptional! Will go back again
4
We ate here during the oyster promotion, when 10 Claymore was offering 6 varieties of oysters. I didn't partake of the seafood, but dining companions felt that the freshness, quality and quantity on offer was really excellent. I concentrated on the mains (non-seafood) which I felt was really quite good, for buffet standard. There was a mixture of western and asian choices on offer, and a novel concept of small a-la-carte choices, including the signature Penang kway-tiaw (which, surprisingly, was pretty good). The children enjoyed the chocolate fondue, pasta station and crepe station. The only slight fly in the ointment was the desserts - perfectly adequate but perhaps not achieving the standards of the main. Coffee was included in the price. Ambience was fine, although the restaurant is located in the foyer of the hotel. Service was polite and friendly, though service crew were obviously quite busy. One suggestion was that we could not locate dessert or tea spoons to sample the desserts - perhaps management would consider providing separate cutlery for desserts. Seating space is smaller than some other venues, therefore, advance reservation may be wise. Overall, an enjoyable experience and one of the better buffets I have experienced.
4
My second visit, first visit was high tea n this time had dinner. Awesome n good quality food. If u like Penang food, you may try out chef signature fried kway tiao. Generous durian filling for crepe. Good varieties of fruits n pastries.
5
Have a gathering there. Is oyster occasion now, free flow & freshly open oyster. Food quality is excellent & definitely friendly staff & cosy atmosphere. Worth for money. Great place to visit.
4
Had a fantastic oyster occasion at 10 at claymore with good quality seafood, free flow oysters that is freshly shucked, with good quality service. Totally fulfilled my oysters craving. They also have free flow lobsters, foie gras. I'm a seafood buffet fanatic and this is comparable to other higher end buffets in other hotels in singapore, but at abt 2/3 the price. There were quite a lot of diners, hence the turnover rate of the food was good. Their dessert is not as great, but the seafood more than made up for it
5
This was my third visit to the restaurant. Depending on the season and festival, there is menu designed to match the occasional. Offering fresh perspective on every different visit. Price and service delivered matched on par. Service staff at the stations wereengaging and took the effort to ask diners regarding their dining experience. We had the great pleasure of speaking to Chef Andy. And he is friendly and takes pride in ensuring a pleasurable dining experience. Keep up the wonderful work! Great team and good effort.
5
Great restaurant with quality seafood buffet selections. A great place and delightful ambiance for friends to get together. For seafood lovers - variety of oysters and the fresh lobsters, prawns, mussels and shell scallops will definitely satisfy your cravings. Not to forget the must have sashimi corner - which is always the all time favorites. Chef's signature Award winning Penang Char Kway Teow is highly recommended from the buffet a la carte menu. Less oily and yet still so yummy and tasty. And of course the special durian crepe top with lemon grass ice-cream.... This was an unique combination worth trying which I will never forget.Lastly, not to forget the attentive service staff that created the entire dinning experience pleasing. Simply finalize - Great food with Great Service = Great Unforgettable Dinning Experience that you will always want to go back again !!!

We had a Sunday Brunch Buffet at 10 at Claymore.A big round of applause for the waiters and waitresses. Their service was impeccable. The table was cleaned and cleared efficiently, tea and coffee served promptly.Good ambience..spacious yet cosy enough. We appreciated that a round dining table was arranged for 5 of us. We would have been less comfortable with rectangular table.The selection of food was just right.There was a variety of oysters -- NZ oyster, Canadian oyster, USA oyster, Australian oyster, French Normandy oyster, and French fine de claire oyster. Alongside the oyster station, there was a station that served sashimi swordfish, tuna, and salmon. The baby octopus was icing on the cake. Even further down the aisle, there was a big icy container filled with lobsters, crab claws, prawns, clayfish, clams, mussels, etc. The seafood was replenished constantly. We didn't have to wait long before having the oysters opened and served to us. The thai chilli sauce was appetite enhancer.The cheese were splendid and went very well with the biscuits and crackers served.Although the dessert was fair, the chocolate truffle and lemongrass/ginger ice cream was impressive.Other than the dishes along the buffet station, there were several ala carte dishes we could choose from and order. We ordered the penang laksa and award winning char kway teow. Whoa...they were good! I liked the barbecue taste of the char kway teow. The fragrance of the nicely fried kway teow was complemented by the rich taste of the eggs. We ended our brunch with cups of gryphon tea, milk tea, and cafe latte.It was the best milk tea I have tasted. Was it the milk in the tea or tea in the milk that sparked the magic? I can't tell for sure..I guess it was a bit of both
4
Great food. Although the spread is not as wide, but the it's quality is very good. I enjoy the oyster and the other cold dishes. Good place to visit!
5
Fantastic food, the ingredients are very fresh and their soup tasted so authentic. All staff were excellent
5
10 at Claymore has by far, the best buffet i have ever had. I recently went back with 8 other friends for dinner to celebrate my friend's graduation and we had such a blast. With 6 different types of oysters from around the world, it was simply pleasure on all accounts! I think i ate about 20 oysters that night. We also had the plates of pleasure - of which, Chef Andy, personally cooked his award winning Char Kway Teow for us. Two HUGE plates for us! We gobbled it all down as soon as the plate arrived on the table. My favourite of the night was the foie gras available in unlimited portions for the evening as well - topped with caramelised onions ontop of breaded crumbs. Simply cooked to perfection! You HAVE to try the buffet at 10 at Claymore this May and June before their promotion ends. But i'm definitely looking forward to their new offerings in July. Definitely will be back. Keep up the good work 10 at Claymore. Till we meet again
5
A group of 9 of us were at 10@claymore recently and the selection of food, especially from the buffet menu was of good standard and quality. I particularly liked the Foie Gras they served that night, it was pleasing to the palate and well accompanied with garnish of caramelised onions. The selection of seafood was huge, especially for raw seafood lovers, you'll surely love this place. There was 6 types of oysters from different parts of the world, a sashimi bar and a whole dedicated area for shell fishes - lobsters, crayfish, scallops... I really appreciated the cook-on-the-spot section where they had pasta and crepes freshly cooked for you as you like it. The quality of the pasta was good and the selection of the types of pasta was different from the normal spaghetti you would find elsewhere. There was tagliatelle, penne, ravioli... etc. Service was good because we managed to talk to the Head chef and he seemed a warm person at heart, very people oriented and added to our whole experience of being there. We managed to try his Specialty Char Kway Teow that could be ordered from the menu as well, and it was out of the world with the wok-hei well done though this may only suit certain palates. Overall, I think 10@claymore can improve on the part of the buffet spread that was not freshly cooked as some of them did not look particularly appetising, but for the most of it, the food was absolutely satisfying and the experience was worth the money spent here. I'd bring my parents back one day when we have the chance
5
Had dinner with some friends on Monday and I was very surprised at the high standard of food on offer at their buffetThe selection was smaller than other buffets i have been to but the quality really trumps them allThe seafood was fresh and constantly replenished. They even cooked the pasta and the crepes on the spot so you know that it is freshly made and not done in batches earlier in the day. Most importantly, the service staff were polite, efficient, and knowledgeable.A very delightful experience overal
5
We went to 10 at Claymore as a group of 8 for dinner on the 19th of May. I thought that the selection of food, although limited in quantity, was very good in quality. I particularly liked the oxtail and the durian crepe. The service there was very good as well, as the staff was very friendly and responsive. We also had the opportunity to talk to Chef Andy, something which I personally appreciated as I rarely have such opportunities to talk to the chefs. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed myself
5
Although we visited this restaurant primarily for the Oyster Occasions, the quality of other buffet dishes made the entire dinner very enjoyable for even the non-oyster lovers. The dishes available from plates of pleasure menu were really fantastic. During our visit, it seemed that there might have been a limited number staff avaliable. However, all of them were extremely friendly and helpful. Having the Executive Chef visit our table to ask about his award-winning Char Kway Teow was also a pleasant experience
4
There were 8 of us in the party for this buffet lunch at 10@Claymore on 3rd May 2014. Nestled at the side of the what was the main hall, the entrance caught our eye with sashimi (salmon and sword fish) and an assortment of smoked salmon. RIght next to this joint, lined an assortment of juices (guava, orange, pineapple - do not seem to be freshly squeezed). A step or two takes one to gammon ham and surprisingly, rack of lamb - carved out to your delight. As we turned round the corner, there are the perennial favourites like laksa (heavenly spicy!) and prawn noodles (complete with pork bone broth - authentic!) Now, the surprising turn is the next stop which offered freshly made crepes tailored to your tastes with strawberries, bananas, chocolate, fresh cream, and choose what you may like! They turn out well - crispy and fragrant. You can even top it with ice-cream! This line ended with the chocolate fondue. I am not sure if the idea of having a chocolate fondue is overrated, and now, far too common, or has it to do with the chocolate used. This is my little quip.Nearer to our table, is a round table with desserts including what looked like creme brulee and panna cotta (not my faved, I must say). I fell in love with what I thought was almond jelly, and was enticed by the cakes, counting tiramisu and cheese cake, among my favourites. The salad station was right next to the cheeses which cranberry cheese left an impression. Breads, wafers and crackers are available but it was sad that there is no toaster to warm the breads... a pity. What is worthy of mention are the parma ham and waygu beef! This is a wonderful addition to a buffet lunch that is so reasonably priced! Well done!The restaurant introduces something called the "plates of pleasure" and boasts local and asian delights among which fried rice (the smell of sausage wafted through the air as it was served), and avocado with ice cream were smashingly good. Coffee and tea were spot on! Great way to end a meal. Oh, I have missed the mains section, which I did not have time to try. I shall return the next round as there service is great but rather slow. However, everyone has great smiles at all times! Well done, everyone

Having been to quite a number of buffets around sg, I came with the expectation that this would be like any other hotel buffet. I must say I was really surprised and impressed by the food. Selection wise.. I think buffets like Carousel or Line has definitely more variety. But it is the quality of the food which I think triumphs over the other buffets. First of all, there r 2 types of oysters to choose from which r freshly shucked on the spot. As the restaurant is not big, they can afford to do that. Sashimi is fresh and also sliced on the spot. Felt guilty going back for so many rounds but the service staff always had a friendly smile ready. Main courses were ok with the normal international and Asian cuisines. One thing I thought was very clever was tat they had a separate ala-carte menu serving dishes from all over the world eg Canadian cod, Australian beef, Thai som tam and even Malaysian prawn noodles. Very nice touch. Dessert was to die for. Instead of the usual vanilla, choc, strawberry they had lemongrass & ginger, choc chip mint. Absolutely loved the former!!!! Cakes wise I loved the jackfruit cake and lychee shortcake which I have never seen at the other buffets...Unlike the bigger buffets which were jam packed where one had to queue for all the popular dishes, this place has a very relaxed atmosphere. U can relax with a cup of latte or tea (with many unique flavors) while the hotel band plays at the lobby next door in the evening...Overall a very satisfying experience. If u're looking for a relaxing buffet with good quality food, I would definitely recommend this place.
5
Had the weekend brunch with my family. The food was good though not very child-friendly except for the desserts.The special menu dishes did take a while to be served. Special mention to one of the staffs, Angelie - Very friendly and sincere
5
10 at Claymore, a small but dedicated restaurant in PanPacific Orchard Hotel, is really the place to be. Everyone, young or adult, will be pampered by Chef Andy and his team to feel like a king. It is the quality and choice of Asien and international food, the friendly service, the atmosphere and ambiente. Not to forget the excellent beverages. A reservation is recommended
1
Very very disappointing. I m actually here now. Spread unimpressive. Quality abysmal. Service extremely bad. Chilli crabs was crap. Cold seafood stinky. Rendang dry n tasteless. Dont bothe
3
I went for Sunday with my friends, altogether 8 of us. The food were good, especially the Oysters and Lobsters (which I personally like them very much), but a bit disappointed with the special menu dishes that we ordered and waited, but by the time we left at about 8:30pm, we still had not been served with the special crab, penang char kwee diao and some other dishes. Also, we had to keep reminding the staffs for our tea/coffee that we ordered before being served. I think they are under staffs. Service not as good compared to my last visit
5
I went to this restaurant with my family for dinner after viewing through the tripadvisor reviews. It was rank as number 2, but I really dissapointed for those who have given the poor comments. I have had the experiences which far more worst that this which I paid over hundred over dollars just for one. In fact here I find is a lot better the staff here were friendly because my family and I was escort to my seats and ice water poured.I like here is because beside buffet there is a separate menu can be order, I ate the grilled beef and avocado lemongrass with ice cream is yummies.After finish my meals there is a chinese gentleman name Tonny offer me coffee selections and tea selections instead of just serve me coffee or tea.He even explain a bit of tea selections to me, I really surprise which not many restaurant are doing that.I must say he is great staff and also the rest of them.Please keep up your standard
4
As this restaurant is now doing promotions, 3 for the price of 2 (basically less 1 person's cost), my mom suggested going to this restaurant after having a good time there with one of the family friends for lunch a month ago. There were a lot of starters to choose from, mainly cold salad and salmon etc. Their soup- mushroom soup, was definitely not the usual canned one, but one cooked by their in-house chef, I believe. Their hot dishes were also superb. The salmon was just cooked, tender to the touch. Their potato and roasted vegetables were also not bad. There were also a choice of rice and noodles. Their desserts were rather special- lots of small pieces of tiny cakes, and small mango too though a few of them were already rotten. They also had excellent ice-cream selection, with a rare combination of ginger and lemongrass. :) Will definitely come back to this restaurant again
3
I really like their breakfast buffet - can't beat the make your own nasi lemak. fresh fruit juices and very attentive staff.
4
I saw the review to be the best buffet in Singapore and went there. I have to say, i was slightly disappointed. There a lots of choices for cold dishes. But limited on hot dishes. Dessert was dry and left untouched for a long time. The best is Durian panckake. I definitely had better buffet than this before. I wont say it's bad. BUT it's NOT great
5
Had a great time during weekday buffet lunch. The buffet spread was good, food was excellent, service staffs are good and attentive. Overall, my friends and I were happy with the food, the service and the atmosphere. UOB is having dine 2 free 1 promotion until June, and hotel does provide complimentary car park (which saved $14 for 4 hours parking) Best deal ever
5
I never believed my previous experiences at 10 Claymore could be topped. But they did. We were surprised by Chef Andy and his team and our Golden Wedding Anniversery was the best event in our life. The dinner, from entree - all over Asien cuisine - followed by local delicious fingerfoods to excellent main course and super dessert was far more than worth the money. Not to torget the quality of beverages and attentive service by the friendly staff
5
Stayed here for 3 nights and dined in the resturant for breakfast and lunch each day. Food selection and quality was truly delightful. Service and atomoushere was great. Couldnt fault anything
5
I organised a buffet with my family on my son's birthday. Chef Andy specially cooked his signature dish.. penang fried kway teow...yummy!!.. the baked lobster and volcanic grilled beef was delicious. Sashimi was super fresh. Not forgetting the birthday cake... chocolate moist cake... super delicious... must try. Thank you Chef Andy & Chef Chris for the memorable evening
5
A really nice place to pack in the good stuff. Everything was of high quality and the service was excellent. Anything I requested was fulfilled promptly and with a smile. My only complain is for the amount of food that is available, we really did need a bigger table.
5
It's hard to go wrong with choosing to have a buffet here. It is undoubtedly one of the best international buffets in Singapore with great food and a wide variety of international cuisine in a cosy setting in a very convenient, central location off Orchard Road, with attentive service and great value to bootWe went for Sunday brunch and everything we ordered off the a la carte menu (included in their standard brunch buffet) was amazing.Would definitely be back here again with family and friends

I wanted to have pre-birthday dinner with my girlfriend, so I have made the reservation before we go. Firstly,there is no hostess when we arrived.We just walked in and find the stuff. what's more, after we took the food and back to the table, the glass are still empty which means there is no water about fifteen mins!!! Secondly, the female stuff who maybe Indian provides badly service.When we order to her every time, there is no reply, even no smile with dead face!! We order to her when she is clearing the table, she never stops and said "wait!!" with cool face.. Maybe she is par timer, but pls, we spend the money for the service, and it is not cheap.pls provide the 'OK' stuff..Thirdly, the prawn in the char kway teow on the menu is not tiger prawn but normal prawn , as 'OK' hotel, pls don't be a liar. OK? Fourthly, Maybe the seafood is not very fresh, my girlfriend and I are both diarrhea. As pre-birthday dinner..In dessert section, there is no dessert fork. I feel very disappointed about the restaurant, thanks and you have given to me a terrible memory about my birthday..If you disagree any of my opinion, you can find me in the 7th April reservation list and call me(Mr.cai). I don't want to be so evil, but today is very important for me. And your service and quality is very bad and gave me a terrible experience.i may complain to the GM of your hote
5
What a nice place to eat and that too almost anything that you want to, scrumptious food, beautiful presentation and a peachy setup! Had a brunch there and it was finger-licking good. With such a variety of dishes from all over the world, you wish you had insatiable appetite to go through all. Pricey but worth it. A must-try while you are in Singapore
5
There have a nice enviroment for me to dinning in here. They were giving a good service from start to the end. The taste of food was delicious. Especially the durian pancake for my dessert. I will return back to dine again in the restaurant.
5
I was enjoy dinner with my friends.
Excellent taste and service.
Chef was helpful and friendly.
Hope to visit again soon.

5
Had great dinner here.This was my 3rd visit.The food maintain good quality and very kind staff..
5
This is our second visit. The quality of food is great and the place is very cosy, not over-crowded.Must try are the oysters and lobsters. Service is great too. We were served by a Mr Vino who always had a smile on his face and was very friendly and courteous. Will definitely recommend this place to friends. Will definitely be back again
5
Had a great dinner with my wife at PPO while kids were out in Malaysia.. Oysters were fresh and juicy , great herbal duck as the meat was very well cooked. A must try for the cold boston lobster, can"t get any fresher I guess. Best of the best would be the durian crepe... The best I've tried in Singapore and Malaysia....
5
Exceptional Service!! Variety of foods to choose from with amazing flavor. Angelie is amazing!! Make sure you say hello to her when you are there
5
Dined here previously about 2 years ago...came back to try the lunch...of coz, they do not have the same items as dinner as price were different but they do serve quite an extensive range of selections...sashimi were fresh, selections were more to favorites and were just right, as well as they serve Wagyu beef for lunch
5
It's really a must go !! Everything is just perfect !The food is great , Boston lobster , wagyu beef , desserts .. All must try ! Camomile tea was smooth and nice , ambience was so damn good , having buffet while listening to live jazz band from the lounge beside .. Customer service was very excellent , there is this waiter by the name of jaya , his service was really good , everything we needed was being attend to and was great to see his friendly smile ! Price of the buffet is reasonable too .I would definitely be back again. 
5
I took my best client and all his people to this restaurant.I was expecting that we would go a-la-carte, until one of them suggested buffet.I thought that my client would never go for this.Buit after everybody checked out the menu we all agreed that it looked very good.And it also tasted very good.Especially the seafood was very popular.Minus: It took over half an hour before the first wine was served and of many kinds they just had 1 bottle or so
5
The best and must try your self ....All the spread of seafood, oven slow roasted wagyu beef and the plate of pleasure mini dishes as perorder. Very unique and tasty. We do enjoy very much the penang char koay teow , prawn noodles and the crispy durian crepes with lemongrass ice cream. We sure will come back again. Thanks the chefs for all the lovely food
5
Their buffet lunch is definitely a must try. They have excellent quality of food and the staff are very friendly and nice. The chefs there are really really awesome and very passionate about their jobs, especially Chef Eric who is definitely an excellent and professional chef. Love Chef Eric's durian pancake!
5
Good value for money. My sons love this because of variety of choices including seafood and famous "Penang noodle

Recently, whilst on a business trip to Singapore, I stayed at Pan Pacific Orchard. My stay was comfortable. Being a vegetarian, the variety of food is usually limited and does not always meet the palette. I went for lunch on the afternoon I arrived, hungry. Mr. Manikandan, F&B Executive at the hotel, noticed my plight and immediately reached out to assist me with the food. His alertness and attentiveness to my needs touched me, for which I am very grateful. I would love to go back and stay at the place where a customer is made to feel at home
4
Must definitely go for the dinner buffet here on Saturday. They serve excellent quality of food – lobsters, choice fresh oysters from Canada or France, sashimi, cod fish, parma ham, baked salmon, crayfish, mussels just to name a few. The chefs here take great pride in their food and provide personal service. Was celebrating mom’s birthday here and they surprised her with a chocolate cake. Great ambience, great atmosphere. Highly recommended
5
One of the top best buffet that I have eaten. The local delights such as the malaysian prawn mee and char kway teow is simply awesome. Highly recommended, great food, great staff and great service
5
We had a family birthday celebration at 10@Claymorewe were warmly welcome by the staff especially Joe and Jay,the dinner was very wonderful, food was extremely sumptuous.And Chef Andy was happily preparing the durian crepe for us,which we all enjoyed with other delicious dessert
4
Nice atmosphere, a high quality buffet and dedicated staff make this restaurant. I was waited on by Manikan, the F&B Executive of the place, a true professional.What sets 10 at Claymore apart from other buffets in town is the "Auspicious Plates of Pleasure", eight food items that can be individually ordered, are prepared by the chef "à-la-minute" and brought to your table
4
Was there for a team dinner, spread of food is good and staffs were friendly. Beef was good, sashimi and seafood are all fresh. Worth trying!
4
We picked this place based purely on the good reviews in Tripadvisor.We had a feast of fresh and good quality food. Ambience in restaurant is good, coupled with great service. They also gave us a small birthday cake. We had an enjoyable celebration. I definitely recommend this place. Check it out
5
The quality of the food, the taste and service is way above our expectations. Beside the amazing food we were totally surprised by the durian crepe, what an innovative dessert. Highly recommended 
3
Very good buffet, but the warm items are not very hot. like the carvery, once you get back to your table, it's ice cold. Very attentive and friendly staff. A bit difficult to find, as the Hotel is not signposted from Orchard road. Also not a good are to walk around in at night, you are accosted by loads of aggressive prostitutes.
5
It was my best friend's birthday and I happen to chance upon 10 at Claymore. I am so glad that we spent the special night at such an awesome place. Not to mention the fresh and delicious buffet spread; what touched us, was the great service of the Chefs and servers. They were all genuinely concern if we enjoyed ourselves and whether the food was satisfactory. There were even times when they offer to help us decide on our menus so as to ensure that we'll eat to our hearts content. Thank you so much! Special thanks to Mani, the F&B Executive, who really spent time and effort to make our visit such an awesome one. I'll definitely recommend this place to anybody who's looking for a place to rewind and a place filled with love and genuine kind intentions

Dear Andy,Words can't describe the amount of appreciation I had for you for making my dinner date a complete success! I was planning an anniversary surprise for my wife and was looking through the web for a restaurant when 10 at Claymore caught my eyes for the number of rave reviews it had received for both the food and the executive chef. I was skeptical at first but i still emailed you and to be honest, I wasn't expecting you to reply to my email. What follows after was a truly unbelievable experience as you offered me assistance in ways I could have never imagine. Firstly, you accommodated my request to have a quiet corner in the restaurant instead of just telling me to book my seats myself over the internet.Secondly, you gave constructive inputs on the way i should surprise my wife for the special occasion.Thirdly, you gladly offered to received the flowers that I have ordered on my behalf so that my wife wouldn't find out.These at just what you did before the dinner! On the actual day of the dinner, you went out of the way to put up a show with me just to surprise my wife. You also assisted to safe keep my gifts and card so that you can pass it to me subsequently. You showered us with the appropriate attention and even gave us a special treat!I would like to give a special mention to Mani as well who has been very nice to us and even apologise for being short-handed on that day. I do agree with him as it would have been better if there had been a few more service staff in the restaurant that day who are as proactive as Mani.Service aside, the food is also fantastic! We gorge ourselves silly on the seafood on ice and the ala-carte buffet items were also delicious. The char kway teow are truly the best i have ever tasted!Food alone does not make a restaurant. Service matters as well and I believe both you and Mani have been very valuable assets to Pan Pacific. This is a heartfelt email on one of the best service I have ever received and I hope you can help to forward this email to your public affairs branch. I can be contacted at 96271592 if they need any clarifications.Lastly, this will definitely not be the last time I visit 10 at Claymore. I look forward to many more pleasant dining experience at your restaurant.Thank you Andy and Mani!Regards, Mr Ng and wif

Food was very delicious and buffet spread was comprehensive. Seafood was very fresh. Lobsters and oysters were especially popular. Wagyu beef was tender and juicy. Chocolate fountain was excellent, though it would have been better with strawberries too. Crepes were great for dessert. Service could have been improved, waiters could have come to refill water more often
5
This place is very good. You can tell because so many local come here to dine and celebrate, which of course is unusual for a hotel restaurant. Food is excellent. Service too
5
This is my third visit and the quality of food is still of high standards. Service is also maintained at high levels. I would strongly recommend this restaurant to every buffet lover.Special thanks to Joe Nanda, for making the last experience a good one
4
The oysters were faaantastic!! Lobsters good. The coffee bar was excellent. I always like it when they don't make you pay extra for your cappuccino. The high-class char kway teow surprised me too. Was almost as good as the local trademarks. Worth the $60++
5
The friends I am staying with in Singapore treated me to Sunday brunch at 10 at Claymore. They had never been but had read reviews so we were all excited and starved ourselves in anticipation of the experience. (Note: I highly recommend doing this.) We were not disappointed in the least. The space is lovely, and the staff gracious and accommodating. In addition to the buffet, there is a small menu of "treasures" that you can order from (no limit). These should not be overlooked, as they are also delicious. But if I had to recommend only one thing from the entire buffet, it'd be the fresh seafood. I am ashamed to admit that I went back several ties for more lobster claws, scallops, and shrimp. The sashimi is also fabulous
5
Although the selection of food is not alot but the quality of the food is good and the staffs are very attentive.it's a good place for gathering and can enjoy a wide selection of tea. Thumb up for pan Pacific orchard!!
5
last week i visited pan pacific orchard hotel for my business.Its very great because waiteress attitude very nice.i think she is korean.i had breakfast with my business man. we have a lot of talking about our business.so i ask "can you serve 3 fried eggs?"so she ordered 3 eggs to her chef. and then she pick up 3 eggs.Suddenly chef shouted to her. He said "why do you pick up eggs? you cannot! the gust must come here. last day i told you huh? you dont understand?" and he talk to her that tell your guest pick up fried egg by themself. i feel not good, uncomfortable.... i mad to chef and her mood didn't seem to be good. im so sorry to her but her attitude very nice to me. she just smile.she doesn't tell me that pick up eggs yourself...she just done her job even though her mood was not good. i was impressed with her kindness. thanks a lot for your sevice. thank you very much
5
The staff was very friendly and polite. The atmosphere was formal but fairly relaxed. Food was delicious and the dessert table had a large variety of delicacies to choose from. Highly recommend if you're looking for a nice quiet restaurant go have a buffet lunch at with anyone really
4
Went to the restaurant for birthday celebrations on Jan 4 (Sat). Some of the nice food selections are lobster, roast kobe beef, ham, tuna/salmon sashimi, salted bacon slices, steamed whole salmon fish, etc. Beside these, the restaurant is offering the unlimited serving of special Auspicious Plates of Treasure (see attached photo for the menu) as part of Lunar New Year celebration. We ordered all of them and the cod fish, Kurobuta Pork, beef, char kway teow + lotus rice in particular are relatively good. Ice cream variety is rather limited (only 2 choices - mint and lemongrass), which unfortunately are not our preference. Food choices might not seem to be abundant but we are very satisfied that quantity has carefully been traded-off with quality! Adult per head is $68 and half-price for children. There is a 15% discount for most credit cards but the discount was not applicable to children. If not for the credit card terminal that was down on that day and the suggestion to pay in cash, I would have given full 5* score rating
3
Went there by 9pm on a weekday and place was nearly empty. The buffet seems to be the 'in thing' but since we were not that hungry tried the a la carte menu. Not that extensive. Service and serve time were not quick but still OK. Staff were friendly. Being a star hotel was pricey as expected.I recommend trying it out if you are choosing the beuffet, but definitlely not worth for a la carte dining
2
We went there because of the great reviews. I now have doubts they are all true. Food quality is very low, cheap food court style trying to look chic. I find it very expensive for the poor quality you get. It also looked like everyone is coming with discounts, except us.
5
As promised, I visited 10 at Claymore again this year for my birthday. I was not disappointed. There was a larger spread for Sunday Brunch compared to the Weekday Dinners. Seafood was really fresh & thus in really high demand. Throughout my 3 hours there, I noticed the food items being replenished promptly. (By promptly I meant within 10 minutes of the last items being cleared.)Service was a bit slow, but I could overlook this as it was evident that they were badly understaffed. Nonetheless, they were all polite & did not leave out any orders. I want to thank Joyce especially, for taking the initiative to order 2 more servings from the ala carte menu for us as she knew it would be quite a long wait.I loved the beef. I loved the crepes. I loved the lobsters. I'm really, really tempted to go back.The food & the service really made up for the slight hiccups I faced. When I called to make my reservation, I was told that I'd have to pay $68++/pax & they had 10% discount for credit cards from major banks. When I reached, I realized it was actually $72++/pax & there was 15% discount for credit cards. Oh, except DBS
5
Buffet had fresh seafood, sashimi, and a wide range of desserts. Service was good too and staff were extremely helpful and friendly
4
Lobsters sashimi oysters wagyu beef every day of the week. Fresh and well prepared.Service is excellent and attentive with low staff turnover. Our family favourite birthday buffet restaurant. When people say less quantity of choice, that is just comparatively speaking because there are some restaurants which have massive choice but very average quality. There's still a huge number of dishes and desserts here. Some unique items are the lemongrass ice cream and the lobsters prepared with original herb stock. Today I had Fuji Apple carrot soup, tangy with well bodied flavor. My mum enjoyed a specially prepared very crispy light crepe with durian on the side prepared by a talented young chef. The staff have very good pleasant attitudes and smiles especially Rajeev. The restaurant has all types of credit card promotions the year round. Do try it
4
Don't have too many reference points but the bill seemed high for a buffet That said the food was fantastic and the choice amazing. Everything you could want to try beautifully presented with chefs on hand to carve and create custom choices The durian cake was special (if you like that kind of thing
5
Been to 10 @ Claymore for a couple of times, Food quantity is limited But quality is Awesome . Resturant ambience is cosy n very relax . Love the crepe station that Chief will specially make from the toppings that u have requested , Especially LOVE the durian crepes. With complementary surprise bdae cake too , Thank u Chiefs !! :)
5
10 Claymore Has Been The Best Buffet Restaurant In Singapore. Their Food Is Excellent , Fresh , Good , Yummy. Their Service Is Top To The Max. They Are Different From Other Restaurant. Their Ala Carte Menu That You Can Order Is Unlimited , I Love Your Famous Peneng Char Kway Teow. All The Chef Service Was Excellent. Thanks Chef Eric For The Wonderful Crepe
5
My husband and I dine in and had a fantastic experience. We enjoyed the wonderful food prepared by the staff. The lobster was fresh & succulent, so very sweet & the Salmon with Hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had. Mr Push and all the staff are very hospitable and make us feel comfortable. Thank you for the sweet lunch and would come back for the excellent service given
5
There are great varieties of food served, and you can also order from the ala carte menu for unlimited servings. This is not a common thing that you can get from elsewhere! The foods are constantly replenished, So don't worry, you will definitely get to taste everything
5
Your restaurant has the best buffet that i have eaten in Singapore. The food is excellent. What is more important is the service attitude of your service staff is commendable. They are an asset to your Organisation. I wish to specially mention Miss Rifquh who is always smiling when serving the customers. She will meet the request of the diners with a smile which makes the diners feel good.My daily loves to dine at your restaurant as we love your food and drinks and more important the service we receive from your staff is commendable and deserve our compliments.Best regardsgoh Lak NgeeHp: 9736493

Very very good durian crepe by master Eric. Wide selection of food for the buffet, would come back again
4
Went here for brunch with my family on my Mom's birthday.The food was decent, the ambience was nice. It wasn't very crowded, perfect for a calm and relax start to our day.On top of that, the service was excellent, they care enough to threw a surprise gig for my mom. The guy named Rajeev was being very helpful to us, and we really appreciate that.Will definitely come back and suggest my colleagues to spend some time here
5
My lunch at this restaurant, by reputation, is superb. The food is fresh, tasty with various choices and international appetizer. The ambiance is nice. Efficient service. Overall, everything is great
5
Had been going to 10 Claymore for over 2 years now. It started with just me and my husband but came back with friends and family. It had become one of our favourite buffetplace all time. Been to other pan pacific hotel restaurant too but still came back to 10 Claymore ! Not only their food was good, but service was excellent too. 100% satisfaction guaranteed. Kudos 10@ claymore team !!! Zul

Good selection n reasonably priced for this international buffet spread. Good service n attentive staff n service was quick too. Hotel is well located within orchard road shopping belt.

Being ardent fans of buffets, my family and I frequent various buffet lunches and dinners every week. As such, having dined at some of the best and pioneering buffets in Singapore, we have developed a certain level of expectation for each and every buffet dining occasion. However, our overall dining experience at 10 @ Claymore restaurant has unquestionably changed our level of expectations for buffets ever since. My husband who is a wheelchair user, unquestionably faced a certain level of difficulty and inconvenience experienced whenever we occurred restaurants which were handicap unfriendly. However, while waiting to be seated, the service crew automatically took the initiative to make special arrangements for us to be seated at a more convenient spot. As we walked in, we had not only been greeted by the mirage of tantalizing foods which had been offered for the buffet lunch, but also embraced by the warmth that the service crew extended to all their patrons. We had been seated down by one of the service crew whose name was Push. He had been in charge of tending to our needs. Push along with fellow colleague Rajeev extended their warmth and courteous demeanour to us, and tended to our every need. Starting our meal, we had been greeted by a wide array of tantalizing foods, where extraordinary foods from both the buffet spread were offered. Each and every dish was prepared with zeal and passion, which had been to our delight. The Asian ala-carte buffet dishes were also nothing but excellent and top notch. The freshly made crepes offered at the live station were exceptional. The staff whose name I can’t remember had been very efficient and courteous even though he alone had to manage not only the crepe station, but the other live stations as well. The crepes were particularly exquisite and delectable to our palettes. Overall, what leaved an impression on us was not only the food finesse, but also the outstanding and admirable service offered by not only Push and Rajeev, but each and every service crew at the restaurant. Their efficiency and consideration towards every diner is appreciated and affirmed. Kudos to the chefs and all the service crew at 10 @ Claymore. It won’t be long before we return, again
5
We have a company lunch at 10 at Claymore. The overall service is better than expected...great food, service and nice atmosphere & setting. The team enjoys and we will sure to be back again. Highly recommended for various visit/purpose
5
10@claymore!!such a great place to dine in on weekends in singapore.awesome ambience with proffessional service from your staff mani.when i reach at this place it was damn full with no seats available .but this young guy came and helped me to get the place for me and my wife..food was delicious especially your seafood...wawaw...yummy... This was my first time in singapore but whenever i come will be visiting you for sure..once again thanks alot mani for making my day..hatsoff!!!!!!!!
5
We had a perfect buffet luch at 10 at Claymore with my friends. Everything is good. The service is attentive, and polite. Food was so delicicous with many dishes from asian cuisine, and the seafood was so variety and fresh. Beside that, 10 at Claymore served many tasty desserts : cupcake, puddding, or crepe with durian taste..it was specific to Singarore.  Thank 10 at Claymore for the wonderful lunch 
5
This restaurant lived up to its reputation. The service and food was excellent. Variety and quality of food on buffet was excellent...everything gourmet from fresh lobster and other seafood to quality Asian food. Tremendous selection. In addition they offered 10 mini items freshly prepared to order. Had a fresh strawberries and cream crepe prepared to order for desert. The service at the table was way above the normal buffet....good service as if we had ordered off a menu. At $59 dollars its also a bargain by Singapore standards. They tend to book up, so make a reservation a couple of days ahead
5
visited the grill on a friday night with a friend. the place had a good atmosphere. overall the quality of the food was very satisfying. the plates of pleasure beef pork and lamb were fresh and of good quality. the sweet potato with the lamb was surprisingly nice, however the sauce on the lamb was a bit salty. the baked seabass was a delight, and the accompanying sauce delicious. however it was disappointing that there wasn't a second serving of the fish after it was finished pretty quickly at around 8pm. Seafood variety, ie crayfish mussels oyster and octopus was generous and widespread and the roast beef flavourful. service was efficient and prompt and really impressive. the mushroom soup was a let down as it felt like it was from a can. had two nice pots of tea to go with our meal. the crepe were delightful and we didnt have to wait long for it. overall we enjoyed the experience, the food was great and would definitely come back if we can enjoy a 1 for 1 promotion as the price is a bit on the high side
5
I was staying in Pan Pacific Orchard two days ago for my business trip. Woke up just in time for the buffet breakfast. The minute I walked into the restaurant, the waitress greeted me, got me a place to sit and asked if I would like coffee or tea. The wide spread of buffet selection really keeps me taking all my favorite food. The food is really good and the service is excellent. The waitress are very attentive and observant as well..they actually spotted my glass has a crack and immediately change a new one for me. During lunch, I tried the Penang Char Koey Teow, it's delicious and authentic. Can't help by ordering Assam Laksa for tea time, guess what, I finished everything and didn't left a drop of soup...taste so good. (Do check out my photos)If you happen to be here or craving for authentic Penang food...it's a MUST try at 10@Claymore, Orchard. Simply delicious with great service...Thumbs up to the Executive chef and F&B team.
5
Best char kway teow i have ever tasted here in Singapore. The dishes i tasted are the best!!! Ms. Angelie is nice too!!! Keep this kind of employees in ur company. Exceptional service
5
Great food, great service and great value for money! Thanks to Push and Angeline for being very accommodatin
5
Celebrated a girlfriend's birthday on 31st Oct. Was impressed by the service rendered by Rajeev and team. Attentive and cleared the empty plates promptly. Complimentary muffin cake for the birthday girl and Rajeev packed us 1 muffin each for takeaway! Love the fresh oysters and Boston lobsters. Thumbs up for the 10 Plates of pleasure, freshly made crepes with durian and the chocolate fondue with assorted fresh fruits. Will definitely visit the restaurant soon! I'm missing the wagyu beef already. :

Would like to thank Rajeev, Kyuri and team for their excellent service and courtesy. Rajeev has been kind enough to offer recommendations on the food and various type of tea available (Yes, they serve tea and coffee). Always ready to assist you whenever you need him.Thank you Kyuri for surprising me with the Fried ball or muffin? on my birthday. Definitely going the extra mile to delight the customers. It was nice that you gave a courtesy call to reaffirm the reservation and checking whether there's any changes required.In general. the staff are pretty on the ball, there was this part time boy who is pretty attention to detail too, hanging around to assist whenever he can. Thumbs up to the friendly chefs for offering a varieties of food and the cold dishes are pretty fresh too. The selections from the ala carte menu is my favourite especially the scallop and the sea perch. Love the taste and texture of the food.Every details matter, I would recommend this place for their good service and food. =)Visited 4th Nov, dinner buffe

5
Fabulous service, my family and I were well taken care of by the wonderful staff from the moment we walked in. The food is amazing, way beyond our expectations. There is a great spread of western and asian cuisine. We love the seafood on ice, everything is so fresh and tantalizing, especially the freshly shucked oysters and the boston lobsters a must-try!! They also have a dessert bar with all the lovely little cakes, a chocolate fondue and an ala minute crepe station! The durian crepes are a must-try so delicious. Coffee and tea are free flow, not just plain water. We will definitely patronize them again soon
5
My boyfriend and i dine in and had a fantastic experience. We were warmly greeted by the staff as we entered, we are then presented the plates of pleasure menu of total 10 items which we couldn't resist ourselves in ordering more! The food was beyond my expectation, especially the seafood variety was so tasty! The executive chef by the name andy, even went the extra mile in cooking his award winning penang char kway teow and it was so tasty. Certainly we would return back for more surprises
5
Superb service and quality food. Im so happy and will be back to have dinner with my friends and family. All the hotel staff so friendly.
4
My type of dinner. Love seafood. Push assured me the seafood served when I call before making my way to the hotel. Push has a lovely smile. :
5
Chef Andy and his team are always at the door to welcome us and make us feel at home. We enjoy the wonderful food prepared by them, especially Chef Andy's char kway teow. Mr Push and all the staff are very hospitable and make us feel very welcome. Thank you for the wonderful lunch
5
We had the buffet dinner here and the food and service were excellent. Wonderful seafood and a vast array of choices to suit every taste. Service was lovely with very friendly attentive staf
5
My experience at the restaurant was truly mind blowing. Thumbs up to the warm and friendly manager, Joe and his great team of chefs (chef Eric is amazing) and the waiteresses/waitersWe had a birthday celebration recently at Claymore. Even though the location is a bit off (smacked behind the bustling orchard road), I must say, the restaurant is an Oasis in the desert.Ambience: High ceilings, warm lights, spacious seating, plus background Jazz vocals from the lounge area... awesome!Service: you feel like a VIP... Joe was attentive and responsive. The red wine we wanted was out of stock, and he recommended an alternative, which turned out to be far better than expected. Perfect match to the food we ate, He also came up to us ask for our feedbacks like what we would experience at fine dining restaurants (not buffet restaurants). Upon my request for that surpirse small birthday cake for my husband. , he acceded with a wide smile. He said, "you can sms me when you want the cake to be served" how thoughtful!The team was efficient and at the same time, warm and friendly Seriously, i had been to other buffet restaurants and some fine dining restaurants charging at a price much more, but I had never felt so pampered as a customer. The team of waiters and waiteresses were efficient and always serves with a warm smile. Making our experience very comfortable.Food: Besides the buffet spread, what was worth shoutabout,is their 10 plates of pleasure ( cannot remember the term) . The chef will cook the dish upon your order, hence the food comes piping hot.  1) We had rack of lamb, delightfully seared on the outside and pink and juicy inside. another applause. Tasty and pleasurable. 2) We also ordered what appeared to be penang laksa (tangy and refreshing).  3) XO sauce scallop : full of “镬气” fragrant and sweet big chunk of scallopfor the buffet spread Oysters: soooo creamy and sweet, comparable to those i had eaten at oyster farm. Lobsters: best ever eaten in a buffet restaurant. cooked to perfection, juicy and sweet. the thai chilli sauce went so well with it. We even ordered a lobster thermidor after we ate the chilled ones. I was amazed by how well this dish was done. The lobster meat was still crunchy and succulent, not the least overcooked, even though they were made from chilled lobsters. Sashimi: sliced for you only when you order them, hence keeping the freshness nad juices intact.  Durian crepe: the crepe was tissue paper thin!! crispy and fragrant. and i thought the lemongrass sorbet was really a great complement to the durian fillings.I will definitely be back again.Thank you Joe and your wonderful team! Keep up the good work
5
Excellent service and excellent food. Yummy.....lobster...bread n butter pudding...crep with durian paste....many many mor

I went there to celebrate my birthday with my best friend. Their dinner was one of the best I've ever had in hotels! The lobster was fresh & succulent- so very sweet. & the Salmon with Hollandaise sauce was the best I've ever had. I also believe only 10 at Claymore would be able to reuse stale bread by making it into an appetizing Bread & Butter Pudding (Or perhaps they really used fresh bread?). Either way, I found myself going back for seconds... 3 times.The atmosphere was amazing & the waiters were rather attentive. Even though there wasn't any complimentary cake or gifts, I really couldn't care less & I wouldn't mind celebrating my birthday there every year :

Excellent layout is a definite plus. Breakfast choices are extensive, and have both local and continental choices. Nice tea. Everything was fresh and right temperature, and not out of stock! Dinner options were good too.

Food is amazing , seafood spread wasn't too much and just nice, and I was shocked that most of the staffs they we busy but they were still very fast and friendly ms shahnaz was very fast and very proactive in asking us what do we need. A very great experience a surely come back.

After much research on TA for buffet, I decided to celebrate my fiancé birthday with 10 @ claymore. When we step into the restuarant was kind of amused of the atmosphere. Superb and beautiful. The lady who man the cashier personally introduce the menu of the day to us. And water was immediately served after that. Food are nice. What really makes us feel like home is the service that the staffs gave. They cleared our plates so fast that we have no idea what to take next to eat. They are ever ready there to clear our plates and to take orders. Really thumb up for the staff! Would come back for the excellent service given!

Have been visiting 10 at Claymore for business lunches. They serve an excellent buffet spread. However, I have hardly made it beyond the Penang char kway teow (friend flat white noodles with cockles, prawns, crab meat, chinese sausage, beansprout and egg) and Hokkien prawn noodles. Both these dishes of Chef Andy is so favourful and yummy
5
Staff served with a lots of smile.service staff was very attentive and exceed my expectation .Thank you claymore

It was a catch up dinner with a party of 8 other colleagues. Over at 10@claymore, the selection and array of food was pleasant and delightful.Service staff were friendly and sincere and well trained. The plates of pleasure was enjoyable and multiple plates came on as we repeatedly savor upon that. It was a great evening with wonderful company, great food and a nice establishment. Will be back! Worth a visit!!

Every year we organise an annual staff lunch after our staff retreat. This year's lunch at 10 at Claymore was one of the best we have ever had. The quality and variety of the food was good and the service was excellent despite our large group of 80 people.J Chun

Dining experience was awesome. Was very impressed with the service provided by Joe and his team. Will definately come back for more and strongly recommend to my family and friends. Keep up the fantastic service
4
Had Sunday Brunch with my family. The seafood is very fresh and the wagyu beef is very tender. I love the ham that goes well with the sauce. The service staff and the manager Joe Nanda are very friendly. Will come back again
5
All staff are well-trained and very friendly... Joe is very helpful and friendly staff... The food is very nice... I like the dessert very much.
4
Had Sunday brunch. They had two types of freshly shucked oysters which were very good. The wagyu roast and ham were excellent. Had a good selection of hot dishes as well. Not expensive for a hotel buffet in Singapore. Service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive
5
wonderful variety & so tasty. The breakfast is so indulgent with so many nationalities cuisine on offer. Eggs, fresh juice, pancakes, french toast are just a few of the "western' treats cooked to orde
5
assorted array of dippings and jams, friendly chef at egg-station. Relaxed ambience with light background music that makes you feel at a resort rather than in a populated city-country like Singapore.
4
Thank you for the good dining experience.The quality of meat was superb. We love the ambience of the restaurant.Service was great too.Will sure comeback for more and recommend to friends
5
Have a great meal at 10 at Claymore, Pan Pacific Orchard. Service crews are helpful and friendly.Will do a return visit
5
My parents are here for a visit and its their first time in Singapore. The variety of the buffet was really good and the quality of the food is there. Aside from the "Homey" atmosphere, the staff were also amazing, especially the Chef's! Would certainly recommend to anyone!
4
Dinner was so so Choices quite a lot compare to other 4*stars hotel dessert not so amazing but isn't bad buffet compare to Carlton hote

Variety of food available here. The food was great and good taste! Service crews very friendly and attentive. I recommended this place to who like to having a quality food. Cheers...
5
Best dining experience in Singapore!! Special thanks to the Culinary & Service Crew for providing the best varieties of foods and excellent service!!

Roast wagyu beef was one of the best ones at a buffet that I've been to, succulent and good flavour, Penang Laksa was just like how it is at my aunt's, hokkien mee had good flavour, and mustn't forget the Penang char kway teow that had my lunch partner ordering seconds. Sea bass in mushroom was soft and tender, braised duck was yummy... Didn't have space for the other side of the table, save for a morsel of tandoori and an oatmeal prawn. Durian crepe was made with the utmost care for how it must be crispy, not too sweet, and had a good feeling as it gets gently devoured in the mouth. Lovely selection of fresh salads, cheese, fruit, fresh juices. Quality stuff. Two regrets- that i didn't have enough stomachs and that the meal had to end when time was up. And one must not forget the service with smiles from all the lovely staff... They must like working for this hotel, they spread the joy around.. Indeed, I will be back to this hidden gem
5
Great experience and really happy with the staff and their service! We really enjoyed the food!!! All our guests were satisfied and full..
5
Chef Andy, Chef Eric, Chef Wei Kiong ,Jay and teams are helpful and friendly. Thank you to all of them for giving us a memorable dinner
5
We have a wonder birthday dinner at 10 Claymore, it is a very good memorable dinner for us. All the associate here are very friendly and cheerful, we really enjoy our dinner. Especially Chef Andy, Eric, Wei Kiong, Jay, Joyce .. Thank alots to all of them

Few confessions:1. We got this meal for free as we did an event here.2. We tried their sister resto, Edge @ Pan Pac Singapore, GOSH, this is WAY better.Spread:1. It doesn't look like a big place, but EVERY item oozes QUALITY.2. Can't believe my eyes when I saw exclusive items like:- TWO kinds of oysters - Canada and France- Lobsters (I've NEVER had it this fresh before. It's on one of my photos.)- Iberico Ham (omg I finally got to try this good quality outside of Spain)- Wagyu beef- Oxtail (really comparable to the ones I have at restaurants)- Butter Salmon (I was really full but I still took 2nd portion of this...)- Chilli lobster pincers (pure pincers, so it's all flesh and so easy to eat!)- Organic Spinach (attention to details even for the health conscious)- Durian Crepe made on the spot for you... it's heavenly. Even better with the unique lemongrass ice cream.And all of them real fresh + delicious. See it for yourself.3. For around SGD60 per person, how can this be considered expensive? I'm sure if I ordered all the above at a usual restaurant out there, it will cost me at least SGD80 per person!Service:1. Well, so we did have this as a free meal. But nonetheless, we weren't treated with any less hospitality. We got our service reminder calls about our booking, and staff was so polite even though we had to change dates.2. All staff served with a smile, attentive, gentle and unobtrusive when clearing the plates from our table and even when topping up drinks.3. Even the chefs of respective stations were sincere. Chef Eric even went on to tell us to return to our table so we won't have to wait while he served some specially crafted dessert for us. How cool was that?Really, I believe they did the above so well because Pan Pac Orchard is a good business hotel that understands what it takes to serve businessmen! They remember most of their guests names evident when they greet most guests by name, and they're always fast and professional in getting things done.By the way, you know they're really good when you see all the awards they won, put up on their wall. At least 10 different culinary prizes I think

Just another meet up dinner with some old friends at 10 at claymore. Was initially rather disappointed with the service due to the long waiting time and some miss orders. But a particular staff of yours Hana save the day. She was aware of our unhappiness and tried her very best to correct the situation which she did, we left with a happy experience. Thumbs up for Hana excellent and attention. Well done 10 claymore with excellent food and a wonderful staff you had

I dined here for the weekday dinner buffet with my partner. Overall, a decent place to eat with some really good food, but choose wisely as not everything hits the spot. In fact, some fall quite far short. Food alone, I may have given 4 stars, but the service let it down a fair bit. You will probably get more value for money if you dine with more people such that some dine for free. Reservation: I called a few hours prior to my visit, and asked for a nice table for two. I was asked if I was celebrating an occasion, and subsequently told that I would be given a table at the window, and the staff “would prepare something for us”. It never happened. We were ushered to a table near the buffet spread, and never received any ’surprise’. Better not to make empty promises, although this is likely due to lack of communication.Food: The buffet spread itself was pretty good, with some hits like the “Peddler’s Penang Char Kway Teow”, “NZ Rack of Lamb” & “Australian Beef Tenderloin” from the Pacific Plates of Pleasure menu (included in buffet), as well as the fresh sashimi and oysters, port cheddar, chocolate truffle & lemongrass ice cream from the buffet spread. However, this was accompanied with several misses as well – “Canadian Queen Scallop” (too salty), “Indonesian Barramundi” (fish overpowered by the spices), strawberry macaroon (too sweet), crème brûlée (flavour rather bland & didn’t have that ‘cracking’ layer of caramelised sugar on top). Overall, quite a good spread of delicious food, but not everything is top notch. Service: The service was decent enough when we first arrived, despite the lack of communication with the staff who took our reservation (see above). However, some of the staff did not seem conversant in English, and got our customised order wrong (no bean sprouts in the Peddler’s Kway Teow). Moreover, all the service staff seemed to disappear once the place started to have more customers, and by 8PM we were unable to get the attention of any service staff. The couple seated near us, had to walk around to get a waiter to notice. Our plates were not cleared and left on the table with our unfilled glasses of water. This culminated in a 25 minute wait for our coffee, and this was only served after a stern reminder to a staff who appeared to be the manager. A visit of some positive moments, but sadly, more occasions of me pondering what could have been
5
Enjoyed the buffet and good service from the staffs! Apart from the cooked food station, guest can also order delicious special dishes from the a-la-carte menu given! Will definitely go again

Just take buffet dinner with my family this dinner. Particularly impressed with its highlight " buffet food and good Staff service from 10@claymore staf

Our family decided to celebrate Mother's Day with buffet treat one Sunday earlier to avoid the crowd, and chose 10 at Claymore over Oscars at Conrad. Our criteria was quality of fresh oysters and the first seemed to have an edge over the latter in terms of variation. 10 at Claymore boasts of its 3 variations - Canadian, American and French. To cut the long story short, we sampled all three (1/2 dozen each) and decided French was the best and went for second round - only to be told that they had ran out of them. It was only 7pm on a Sunday. While we appreciate that there were other choices of food, we were there for the oysters and paid for the buffet so that we could enjoy them to our hearts' content.We raise that to the manager and chef who apologetically told us there was nothing they can do except to serve us the other two varieties. We were told to write in, so I did. If the cafe has informed us that they are running out of oysters for the day when we called for reservation or turned up at the cafe, we would have gone over to the Oscars and tried 10 at Claymore another time. This experience left a bad after taste
5
Just taken buffet lunch with 6 colleagues this afternoon.Particularly impressed with its highlight "durian creep with ice cream".Compliment to Ms Jasmine who prepares creep and lamb. She provided extra service by recommending ice cream for durian creep and she scooped for me even it's placed on another table. She also asked me if I want to have Kikomun soy sauce for my wasabi. It is not available on the table. She walked to the kitchen and brought it to me. thanks Jasmine for your nice service

Went to try out the buffet last week with my family and was not impressed. I am not a buffet person, but was lured by it's high ranking on this website (#6 at this point in time). It's nothing special. Just another buffet. I would have rated it average, if not for the high price it charges for such an average spread. Service was poor. But then again, it's not realistic to expect "service" when one is having buffet.I wont be coming back. Maybe I am just not a buffet person. But then, there are many better places to go to for that kind of money

Starting from June 1, 10 at Claymore presents ‘Pacific Plates of Pleasure’ this June and July!Though 10 at Claymore is primarily a buffet restaurant, I didn’t pay as much attention to the spread as it deserved so I can’t comment much. Except that the fresh Boston lobsters were superb and the Kapiti lemongrass ice cream was wicked! Haha. Like the gourmet high tea at the Lobby Lounge, the impression I had was that 10 at Claymore’s buffet strategy is “quality over quantity”, good one!We concentrated on the ‘Plates of Pleasure’, unlimited servings in petite portions that’s available in addition to the choice buffet spread. I can’t decide which is my favourite — the bouncy scallop with an intriguing blue cheese sauce or the spicy king prawn. The latter is a prawnified version of our local chilli crab, complete with fluffy golden fried buns for mopping up the delish sauce! Barramundi was cutely presented in a wooden tube, think refined mousse-like ”otak” paired with sourish tamarind-chincalok on the side, clever.Full house on a Friday night, 10 at Claymore is clearly popular for buffet among Singaporeans and… Birthday celebrations! While we were there, at least 4 tables broke out in a chorus of “happy birthday to you~ happy birthday to you~~~” throughout dinner. And the sweet service team also sang a belated birthday song for me! How could I not be charmed?!*This was an invited session.

The hospitality at this restaurant is excellent. Coming from a service line myself, I know how it feels to have a passion or inclination to serve and the staff there seem to have gotten that perfected. The waitresses are attentive and prompt in responding to hint of requests by my table of 4. The chefs were extremely professional, without losing the touch of friendliness and Eccentricity. The food there was rather comprehensive, with the much sought after crepes and fresh lobsters, but care could have been taken towards the Canadian oysters. A couple of them carried an awkward stench of possible expiration but the French counterparts were pleasant and worth the health risks. 10@Claymore is highly recommended for the splurge on lunch but be sure to look out for occassional credit card promotions
5
maaaannn!!!! u not been here!!! u aint eaten a buffet buddy!!!! i splurgedd!!!!! took it from the top stripped it to the core!!!! this place will get u satisfied!!!!gastrogasm!!!! to the fullest!!!!thats the good part!!!the bad part!!!!SERIOUSLYY!!!

10 at Claymore is in the Pna Pacific Orchard Hotel and offers and excellent buffet style dinner. Next to a large variety of different foods you can also order several meat and fish dishes that are cooked for you upon order. The staff is friendly and I also enjoyed the savignon blanc that the restaurant served
4
Excellent eggs to order,large range of local dishes, American style crispy bacon, freshly squeezed juice
5
My husband and I had been to 10 at Claymore (dinner buffet) at least thrice and we are always satisfied with each dining experience. Great seafood selection; fresh Crustaceans.Main attraction: "Plates of Pleasure"...portion was just nice. I had 3 servings of the "Norwegian Wild Salmon with Imperial Bonito-Miso Broth and Ocean Trout Roe". Marvelous... never mind the overdose of omega-3 fatty acid because I also savoured their baked salmon and sashimi.FYI, they serve selected TWG teas and gourmet coffee which complement their dessert spread... must try durian crepe with lemongrass ginger ice-cream. On this trip, I must commend Mr. Rajeev, Ms. Pooja and Ms. Kyuri on their excellent service.Their warmth and friendliness made customers feel welcomed.They were attentive and efficient; clearing the used plates and refilling water proactively.They regularly checked on customers' satisfaction and made recommendation.Well done and thank you for the wonderful evening
5
We dined here everyday for breakfast.Food exceptional with lots of variety.Buffet dinner was supberb with beautiful seafood
5
We celebrated mothers day with a buffet dinner. I won't say the spread is huge but the quality is excellent. Must tries include the Wagyu beef, freshly shucked oysters, whole Boston lobsters. Eat a few of these and you would have had your money's worth. Service was excellent. Manager of restaurant was excellent and kept checking on us. Staff were well trained and kept clearing our plates and checking on our water. They also volunteered to bring us cofffee and tea at the end. Overall a happy mother day's dinner.
4
I came for dinner the other time with excitement! Besides oysters, to my surprise they have Alaskan crab, mussels, prawns..it is so hard to resist. With seafood it is best to eat pair it with wine. So I asked Push(might be the manager because he wears jacket); to recommend me on some best selling wines. But in the end I ate the seafood alone because of its sweetness. Push is so helpful and offered great assistance to his staff
5
I'd would recommend this place to my family and friends! Would really love to be back again, no complaints for me and my family! Great service, good food, whatelse more?! Waitress were allSmiling and bubbly and FAST, were very prompt.. Buffet variety was huge.. and i was surprise to see locals workers more than foriegners coz previously our family visited a hotel nearby for buffet too, and we had a little hard time communcating with the waitress, not sure where are they from(maybe china) but here singaporeans.. With very good service, seriously!!! I even confirmed with the Indian girl if she's from Singapore!! We were surprised cos we actually stereotyped Singaporeans that they can't do service line... My apology!!! You guys thumbs up!!! My mother really loved it, so did we! Good job people! Thanks for the great night! Definitely will come back!!!
4
The buffet variety was good, however I didn't really get the chef's style of infusing nearly everything with orange zest. I am not a buffet person, preferring more of a sit down fine dinner experience, but I must say the quality of food and menu design was good. Food aside, I felt that this was one of the best service staff in a long long time! Everyone was friendly and cheerful, and at least 80% local Singaporeans. You don't get this very much nowadays. Thumbs up to the restaurant management for the service

I've been to couple restaurants for buffet in Singapore. 10 at Claymore is the first one that I could enjoy UNLIMITED live open oysters... yeah, I am a seafood lover. I was delighted to see they had fresh oysters bar. Not really big in size though, they were very juicy and a bit salty. Matching with few home-made sauces, they simply tasted awesome!The seafood corner also kept us happy, lobsters, crabs, scallops.... yumyum!!The dessert corner also attracted me, I was delighted to see macaroon in the house! Yes I like macaroon so much. Not many buffet in Singapore serves macaroon, so I was kinda happy!Apart from the nice buffet, we had enjoyed two bottles of nice white wine. White wine is always the best friend with seafood, yeah :D at the end we spent like SGD 100 per person (Buffet + wine). If my parents visit Singapore, I would definitely take them here for seafood craving!!!

We went to 10 at Claymore for a birthday celebration. The food was great - great quality food even though not much of a selection. Was very impressed with not only the food but the waitresses. They were geniune, prompt and always smiling.The great disappointment was when it was time to make payment. We had a disagreement on the soft drink charges - we were told more than once that it is free flow and part of the buffet (like the coffee). So there seems to be a communication issue between us and the wait staff but why should the customer be penalised? In any case, the HUGE SHAME was when the manager got one of his wait staff who served us (there were a few who did) to come to the front counter to be questioned by us while he stands there. The attitude of this manager in treating his team members was appalling! You NEVER should place your team members on the spot while trying to clarify a situation. You should always speak to them in private unless requested by the customer that they would want to speak to the staff direct.We then asked to speak to management and he said he is management. But lo and behold - another higher ranking manager came out to speak to us instead. This manager's attitude was not the best so try to avoid him where possible - you can recognise him as the one who walks around the buffet without a smile. I am not sure if he is aware he is in the service industry.Such a pity that a wonderful evening is marred by such a person and such a terrible policy the hotel upholds on mistakes made by themselves. We ended up paying for discounted soft drinks even though it was not our fault (we asked more than once - this we kept repeating to them but a deaf ear was turned). Once again - kudos to the chef and the wait staff. Not sure if we would be recommending the place to others though after this incident.Also, I wonder if Pan Pacific has anyone monitoring such feedback as I do not see any response even when good reviews are given
5
The title says it all. More variety than The Line at Shangri La Hotel. Includes waygu beef, lamb rack, drunken prawns, oysters and durian crepes. Really delicious. Who says buffets are all quantity and no quality?
5
Celebrated my brother's birthday here and the food was just simply delightful! There were 6 of us and we had a great time with the delectable dishes. What i loved was the selection of cold dishes - Boston Lobsters, two different selections of freshly shucked Oysters (most buffets only serve one selection), Alaskan King Crabs and many others. The buffet also came along with the Plates of Pleasures à la carte buffet which my younger brother absolutely loved - he had 4 rounds of the honey glazed lamb! To top it off, they gave us a cake to celebrate my brother's birthday which was a really great touch to end our dinner. The staff were also very friendly, the chefs also kept coming to check on us, which we felt was very thoughtful. I would definitely come back here with my family again; maybe for our next birthday celebration

For full reviews and pictures, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfat.This time, i had the brunch buffet at 10 at Claymore, a modern bistro grill offering a sumptuous collection of contemporary European cuisine, accentuated with some Pacific Seafood touches. Fresh scallops, prawns, Alaskan King Crabs, lobsters and sashimi are available. And i loved the creamy and more substantial Canadian Fanny Bay oysters. Can't say no to the Iberico ham that was the centerpiece display (till i devoured it whole). The cheeses that i love are available as well, and i spotted smoked cheddar and blue cheese too. The Whole Roast Wagyu Bolar Blade has a fine marbling of between 9 to 10 and it was quite juicy despite its dry appearance. There's quite a variety of Chinese dishes in fact and all are well executed. The Steamed Lotus Rice was fragrant though i wish for it to be more moist. Oh and that Kurobuta Pork should not be missed as well. Organic Plates of Pleasure are available in Apr and May. You would be happy to know that you get unlimited servings of these petite plates and every dish was stellar. The Organic Pressed Home-Made Dou Fu was silky on the inside and the golden exterior was really aromatic. The green stuff is actually organic spinach which is compressed together with the toufu. Love the light tasting broth which is slightly sweeted by the Pacific Blue Crab.While the Norwegian Wild Salmon in Imperial Bonito-Miso Broth may not have a strong miso taste (i'm comparing it to Nobu's famed Miso Cod), i appreciated the light touch in flavoring, leaving the fish to speak for itself. The perfectly cooked meat gave way to a moist pink centre which was just of the right texture.Our favorite dish was the New Zealand Grass-Fed Beef Tenderloin no doubt. The fork tender medallion had such an amazing texture that i hardly needed to chew on it. Chef Chris explained that the meat is roasted under low temperature (similar to sous vide but in an oven) to break down all the veins typical of grass fed beef. They do it for the lamb rack too. The creamy and starchy Mashed Organic Potato with Truffle was irresistible and Nutty Marmalade Crème was a great complement to the meat.The sweet section was quite extensive as well with many cakes, puddings and more. We had the interesting Lemongrass ice cream from New Zealand that day. I quite enjoyed the bread pudding, as well as the petite mango pudding.Do not give the crepes a miss. We asked for the extra crispy one with Mao Shan Wang Durian topping and it was out of this world. The puree is the real deal and it's a convenient way of eating durian really. Damn i'm missing this already

Variety of food available here. Wagyu beef is a must try together with the sauce that comes with it. Then desserts were also great. Friendly staff and very nice atmosphere. Especially Mr Push! Great service from him! All in all 2 THUMBS UP
4
We had a departmental dinner for about 35 of us at the restaurant. Food and service was great. Staff were really friendly and helpful. Food was replenished quickly, and were very tasty. Strongly recommend the creme brulee (one of my collegues ate 6 in one shot), canadian oysters (someone gulped down a dozen) and everything from the palates of pleasure (?), the tasting menu that accompanies the buffet was great. I personally liked the lamb rack and angus beef very much
5
Our group of 42 people have just enjoyed a wonderful dinner in this plesasant place with premium quality of service and the food itself. Definitely we will visit this place again next year during Chinese New Year season. Lovely Angelie, Jagan and Jay, see you next time!
3
had to try the 10 plates of pleasures semi buffet dinner after so many good reviews. In the end, was just over hyped. Not worth the price. Lamb roast was not well done and since we ordered in a group, it came in a stack (1 plate!) minus the presentation if it was ordered individually
1
After reading all the rave reviews here and from other sources, my friend and I decided to give this place a try, but we were sorely disappointed. In fact, we felt cheated.Once we were seated, we immediately got up and looked around for the steak and lamb that was supposedly included in the buffet. We found NONE. The variety of food was also extremely limited and we had to continuously go back for the same type of food. Moreover, no drinks were included in the buffet and the beverage menu was not impressive either; it was simply a card split into 2 sections - 1 for very normal wine and the other for $8 coke.There was absolutely nothing special on the buffet menu that night. No steak, no lamb shank, no NOTHING. All we found were very normal food like chicken, fish, RICE, etc. Food replacements were also slow to come. The crayfish seemed to only be available every 30mins and there were always 1-2 empty trays on the buffet table each time we went to take food.The service was good, and I don't know about the prior experiences of others, but my own experience was TERRIBLE, to say the least.Per person, we paid close to $70 each and for this price we felt absolutely cheated. I WILL ACTIVELY ADVOCATE AGAINST VISITING THIS CON-SHOP

I cannot rate our experience at 10 @ Claymore highly enough. Our booking was for 6 Adults and 2 Children for the Christmas evening buffet. It also happened to be my husbands birthday. The buffet on offer was very extensive and catered for all of our varying levels of food fussiness. The sashimi and fresh seafood section should get a special mention as it was regularly replaced and of a very high quality. The food in general was extremely fresh and tasty. The wines included in the free flow option were also above average, especially for the price. There are many buffet options of a similar standard in Singapore but what made this stand out were the attentive and friendly staff. A special mention to the manager MR Iqbal who led a fantastic team and really made our night memorable.Book a table and take some friends you will not be disappointed

Booked a table for seven to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday here. This is one of those places that I would go for if buffet is on my mind. This restaurant does not do the typical buffet where u get all your food from the buffet table. They serve the highlights of the buffet ala carte, order and it will be served fresh from the kitchen. I realised that they have changed the ala carte orders menu, omitting Asian fares but include additional western dishes like quail and cod fish which is welcomed by all of us, after dining at the restaurant a dozen times before.The angus beef is still as good and so are the lamb racks. We loved the cods but we found them to be too small a size, in fact just one mouthful. They serve lobsters and oysters hailing from Canada and France on the buffet spread too. Prawns were fat and juicy. However the sashimi seems to be only average and yes, they serve tuna sashimi as well. Large spread of desserts to end the dinner, not forgetting a cup of hot coffee or tea.Still one of the restaurant that serves better quality buffet spread and value for the money
5
Just gone to 10@claymore for family buffet lunch to celebrate my dad's birthday and new year. I think the variety of food is less today compared to usual, but the price is also cheaper too. The place is nice and cosy, not too big and the number of people in the restaurant is kept to a comfortable number, so there's no long queue or mad rush for the food, which is really really nice. It is a buffet place.The wait staff are also very helpful and have good attitude. They are quick to respond and things get done really fast and efficiently.The food is of great quality. Each of the food are well cooked, succulent, juicy, everything are really really nice. The roast lamb is really well done. It's juicy and tender, and there is minimum smell to it. Each mouthful is really heavenly. The seafood casserole is also another very good dish. The selection of cheese is also good.There's also a chocolate fountain, just nice, not too sweet.The dessert is also very nice.My whole family totally loved it
5
Had buffet dinner with my family. The service was excellent. Everyone was so attentive. Special mention goes to Chef Andy. I was at the crepe section and he told me to take a seat while he prepares it. He personally delivered it to me - the crepe was one of the best I have tried. The boston lobster, French and Canadian oysters and cod fish were excellent. Food was fresh and I had a hard time eating all of it. Thank you so much

i went in with high expectations since this is rated #2 on this site and is the highest rated buffet in town. And i was disappointed. This is a very standard 4 star buffet. The spread of local, japanese and western food is average. The japanese sashimi is fresh, but not the freshest. The turkey and salmon are only ok. There is only 1 choice of soup and the tomato soup is average. The oysters are smallish like most other places in singapore. There is a choice of some "high end" buffet items like beef steak, cod, quail and lamb which we need to order per plate, and i need to elaborate this joke more. Granted , the waiter did "warn" me the potions are small, but "small" is way understating it. The cod was ok. The beef steak was smallish, but acceptable. The hint of truffle oil makes it interesting. The quail looks more like a sparrow thigh, it's the tiniest bird part you'll ever see in your life. The lamb "rack" was worse. It looks like it came from Mary's little lamb, maybe even newborn. Desserts were average, but the lemongrass ginger ice cream was interesting. All in all, a very average place, totally undeserving of its #2 slot. This is a far cry from the champagne brunch buffets you get at the Ritz Carlton etc

The food is great but most importantly, the service is great!The boston lobster with plenty of roe is to die for. Remember to eat all of the Ala Carte Order - Plate of Pleasure. The Cod Fish and Grilled Lamb are really nice.Executive Chef Andy is a great chef who dish a storm for my vegetarian friend.Thank you

My wife and I had the buffet dinner at 10 at Claymore mainly because the restaurant is so highly rated on TripAdvisor and secondarily because it was offered as a GHA Discovery platinum experience. We arrived early on a weeknight and found that there were very few diners at 6:30 pm, but the restaurant soon filled up. Non-alcoholic drinks were free, brought to us by the staff.Unlike many buffets, the foods are generally high quality. We noted that there was a crowd waiting for oysters to be opened, and the seafood section was especially popular. Our favorites were found on an a la carte menu of about 8 small meat/seafood entres that can be ordered free. They are small portions, carefully prepared to your well done-medium-rare preference. I chose pepper sauce Angus beef which was tender and juicy, and my wife chose New Zealand rack of lamb with collops of baked pumpkin which we both agreed was sweet, tender, and really outstanding. My wife praised the roast duck, and I appreciated the roast lamb shank. For dessert, we recommend the lemongrass-ginger ice cream for its unusual mainly-lemongrass flavor. The cost for a buffet dinner for two people with only soft drinks was SGD 170. The staff were attentive and refilled drinks quickly.We are not particularly attracted to buffet feasts, but we would have to say that the whole experience was excellent. The buffet area was not very large, so there was a feeling of intimacy. It seems that each Pan Pacific hotel, worldwide, has at least one outstanding restaurant. This one is outstanding

We finally went back to 10@Claymore after trying to reserve for dinner during weekend. My family made it this weekend and it was worth the wait. The food has been consistently excellent. We returned specifically for the seafood spread they serve - excellent lobster, plump shrimps, tender scallops and of course, the freshly shucked oysters. We went back for several rounds.The Plates of Pleasure menu also had a la carte menu as part of the buffet. We enjoyed the lamb and steak. The other dishes in the buffet were also great - loved the HK noodle and the braised oxtail.Service was great. Angelie took care of us from the time we arrived to the time we left. She was attentive and quite quick on her feet. And because the restaurant is not too big, the buffet felt like a small party. We will be back again

My girlfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary, Thank You for the surprise cupcakes!! The food is really good, I love the extremely fresh lobsters and freshly shucked oyster varieties. The plus thing is the small a-la-carte menu, Lamb is really nice so as the beef!Staff were all friendly and efficient in clearing our plates! Be back again
5
Presently surprised. Excellent seafood selection and quality. Chocolate fountain the girls’ favorite. But if you are looking for hot food, you might be a bit disappointed on the selection. I guess it was because they have a made-to-order all-you-can-eat entree menu. The honey lamb was particularly good. The only negative – the restaurant was in the corner of the hotel lobby – feeling a bit like seating and eating in a canteen with nicer furniture. Why the expectation? I actually called ahead and they told me no shorts - there I saw a couple eating near the entrance in shorts... In any case, will go again, but next time in shorts

Had a great time here with my friends for my birthday celebration in October! Service was good as they cleared our plates very quickly and the buffet line was always tended by a chef. Food was replenished promptly and the dishes were fresh and very delicious. I love the cheese selection, salad bar and the oyster bar!When I made the reservations, I informed them that it's my birthday and was told I will receive a free cupcake but no one brought out the cupcake until I requested for it towards the end of the dinner. There's no communication between the greeter and the wait-staff and that's the only downside to a wonderful experience. Certain credit cards offer promotions so do check with them what promotion they have. I used my UOB card which offered a "4th person dine free" deal. Contrary to many other buffets in Singapore which uses credit card discounts or Groupons to entice the crowd in but provide sub-par food, 10 at Claymore maintains their standards.The place is small and intimate and you won't feel like you are in a hawker centre with lots of noise and crowds.. Comparing this to the 'famous' Shangri-la Singapore's The Line.. this is a much better and cheaper option

I am not a buffet lover. I typically think that buffets are expensive and of poor quality since they are only interested in bulk business. Here at 10 at Claymore it's totally not the case. Lots of the freshest oysters that you can eat with sashimi and cold seafood galore from Boston lobsters to huge prawns. Frankly if u r looking for a huge spread that goes beyond what your eye can see then this is not the place for you. What they serve here is a small but premium selection of fresh quality food. There is even a plates of pleasure ala carte buffet menu of black Angus steak and grilled lamb. Go for their Australian freshly shucked oysters au naturel.Then enjoy some sashimi of salmon and tuna. Get a selection of the plates of pleasure and then end off with lots of dessert from cheese to cheese cakes. Best of all from now until end of 2012, for members of the GHA Discovery loyalty programme who hold valid local experience awards, you can dine for free with a redemption of your award. Fab

Wonderful seafood spread and friendly crews. Value for money and i satisfied with the service staffs. Thank you 10 at Claymore.

I am happy in 10@claymore. The brunch is excellent and outstanding. Keep it up. Chef and Iqbal and the whole team is excellent....Raymond

Lobster is great, oysters are fresh. Plates of pleasure is good. Service staff are very attentive and corteous. Will be back again!

We had a long table composed of 12 adults. The service was great. The waitress/waiters were polite, corteous and very helpful. The food was very good. Above all my family was happy! We'll definitely be back!

We made reservations for a birthday dinner 2 days in advance, notifying the staff that my family and I were celebrating my dad's birthday. The Bad:There was no free birthday cupcake offered to us until we made a request towards the end of the buffet. And it seemed like none of the staff knew it was my dad's birthday, except for the restaurant greeter. When my dad finally received his birthday cupcake, which we requested to be packed, it was squashed into a rectangular tupperware as they had no other containers to pack it nicely into. So -1 pt for service, as I felt they lacked the 'human touch' and attention to detail.In addition, plate-clearing was slow, considering the fact that the restaurant only had a couple of guests at the beginning of the night. There was one staff that was walking around aimlessly and didn't even come to our table until the manager instructed him to do so to clear our plates. Another -1pt for service.When my dad requested for a finger bowl, the staff did bring us one but the water was COLD, which was highly unusual. I've had many buffets here in SG, and I've always been served with a warm finger bowl, never a cold one. So I figured that either the staff doesn't know what a finger bowl is, or she didn't really care and simply prepared some sliced lemons and cold water in a bowl. One last -1pt for service. -1pt for ambience, as we were sat right next to the glass window, which faces the hotel lobby, where vehicles drive in and out from. I've been to buffets with a better ambience.The Good:The food was really good, except for the mains, which I didn't really care for. So, -1pt for food.The lamb with orange-peanut sauce and the ribeye, which were cooked to order in small portions, were excellent. I've never had lamb that good, accompanied with that kinda of sauce, and it was a match made in heaven.The seafood, was great! Even though the amount laid out seems small, once it gets depleted, the chefs promptly replenish it. Fresh oysters (Tasmanian and New Zealand I think) shucked on the spot, juicy scallops, medium-sized prawns, perfectly-cooked mussels, sweet crab claw meat that comes out easily from the shell (a sign of freshness) and crayfish with its roe still intact! The spread truly surprised me, as I had always thought that the seafood spread at Melt Cafe in Shangri-La was the best in town.The crepe station offered a variety of fillings, but I went straight for the durian crepe, which was delicious! Tried the strawberry one too, which was equally delish. You can go crazy with the toppings; from chocolate sprinkles and diced berries to fresh whipped cream and strawberry syrup.The desserts were pretty decent, with a good mix of cakes, jellies/mousse/custard in shot glasses and a few local offerings (tau huey and cheng teng, if I remember correctly). The chocolate and strawberry macaroons were yummy, next to the coffee station. Only two flavours of ice cream were available, but I was way too full to try them (because I had three fairly large portions of awesome seafood). Conclusion: All in all, if it weren't for the half-past six service that night, I'd rate the restaurant 4.5 out of 5. I would highly recommend the buffet to anyone looking to get some bang for their buck

We are very happy with the service staffs, everyone is smiling face helpful and friendly- as well with the food spreads it's just enough for a.dinner buffet spreads. The oysters and lobster are really fresh the crepe I askbthe chef to put everything on it and he really did! I really appreciate. My family is very happy! Thank you!

Visited this restaurant for the first time, was told by one of my friend that it is good. Indeed, it turns out to be a pleasant experience with extensive selections of quality food. Nice cheese spread, excellent brie cheese that they have, and of course, they have cheeses that you seldom find anywhere else. Great seafood selections, of course I don't say that they have lots and lots of varieties, but they have just enough and just the right popular choices. Nice beef texture from the so called mini ala carte menu that was included well to incorporate the buffet selections.Friendly chefs and staffs to serve you well

My friend and I visited 10 @ Claymore for an indulgent buffet, and indulgent it was! The seafood was fresh and the selection of oysters were much better than most other hotel buffets I've been to. We also particularly enjoyed the Plates of Pleasure which was a selection of made-to-order specialty dishes that come in small portions, that patrons could place endless orders for. One of the dishes was the Angus steak and it was really delicious! There was also a huge array of desserts, but we missed trying most of them as we were enjoying too much of the mains and hot dishes that there was no space left in our tummies! Our experience was further made pleasant by the jovial staff and especially Jay, who oversaw that we had an enjoyable dinner. He was friendly and a joy to have a little chat with..if only he could have joined us for dinner! Would definitely return again - for the food and the great service

With strong Penangites blood running in me, I constantly crave for delicious Penang food! I'm very choosy when it comes to food selection and I do not trust just any restaurant which advertise of serving Penang local delights.Thus, Pan Pacific Orchard is my safest bet, guaranteed the most authentic Penang food. Recently satisfied my cravings with a plate of Penang Char Koay Teow which I thought was safely replaced by the local version. However, upon the first mouth, the strong aroma and taste of Penang - I knew this was irreplacable. Next is a bowl of the famous Penang Laksa, which I'm sad to say till now I still cant find a decent bowl elsewhere! Pan Pac serves very authentic version where for a moment I thought I was actually back in the Pearl of Orient. I finished everything in the bowl and not a drop of soup left! This is how delicious it is!My final bowl is none other than Penang Hokkien Mee. Not just the pork rib taste which you get around Singapore, but the very original version from Penang with strong taste of prawn soup. Again not a drop of soup left in my bowl. If you wish to taste everything at one go (like myself), pls go for sharing, though you may feel like re-ordering another bowl just for yourself. You might even want to finish off with a plate of Penang Rojak too!By the way, Pan Pac serves great buffet spread as well. They serve the real lobster (and not crayfish!) and I fall in love with their delicious durian crepe too! Real taste of 'Mao San Wang' durian paste in the hot crepe, serves with a scoop of unique flavoured ice cream. Not vanilla but something very refreshing (looks more like sorbet than ice cream) with a hint of Lemongrass. I had a very satisfying meal last weekends, all thanks to great authentic food at Pan Pacific Orchard

Food are excellent and service are great! The angus beef is a lot better than the one in Outback . Oysters are fresh and the lemon grass ice-cream is delicious! I was there to celebrate my son's birthday. The manager gave my son's a little birthday surprise and delighted him! I especially wants to thank the manager Jagan. He is so caring and provide us with a great service! I would definitely come back in the near future

Good food. Good service. Good music. Good ambience.

Wide range of food with excellent quality and good taste. Service crews very attentive and very friendly.

Dinner at 10 @ Claymore is great... Nice oyster, salmon, hot food and desserts...
Thanks for all service staff and chefs.

I had a dinner with my colleague before I started work a couple of weeks ago. The food is fantastic! I love the oysters and lobsters from the seafood rack. The plate of pleasure is deliciously too. The steak was cooked till perfection and the spinach toufu was fried till perfection with generous garnish of truffle sauce. The staff there was splendidly helpful. Jobelle was always there to refill my drinks and efficiently cleared plates from my table. The assistant manager Jay was also charismatic and provided us with information on the plate of pleasure. I would definitely come back here for the food again

Good food n service, staff were very attentive to our needs, carting away finished ditches as soon as we were done. Had an enjoyable meal n service, sep. coming from ms. Siva n Alyssa, Jobelle n Ariel, panith N Jay. Regards. Thanks to all at 10@Claymore

I waited 5 minutes to get the attention of a server, so that I could order one of their special dishes that supplement the buffet. I was told I had to wait for someone else. Then, 5 minutes later, I was told the same by another server. Why could they have not given my order to the individual responsible for taking orders for the special items?Much of the buffet food was cold, perhaps due to only a few customers (at 7pm).At s$55*++, this is less expense than other buffets in Singapore, but I wished I had gone to one of my more regular buffet places. It would have been worth the extra money
5
I have eaten at 10 at Claymore on numerous occasions and what has always remained a welcome constant is the quality of the food and the warmth of the service. Last night was no exception. While there are other buffets in town with a more varied spread, the quality of the food at 10 at Claymore, from freshly shucked oysters and lamb T-bone to the mushroom soup and crepes, was positively mouthwatering. I especially liked the fact that the oysters were shucked so no shell bits remained and the flesh came cleanly off the shell, as well as the fact that the crepes were cooked exactly as I requested: crispy. The wait staff here are very friendly and were both attentive and polite
5
It was our first time dining here but we'll definitely be coming back in the future.We arrived a bit later than scheduled but they were polite and lively in receiving us.They were obliging to our special diet requirements by offering to marinade and prepare the dishes according to our specifications. The servers were very attentive throughout the dinner as well as pleasant and courteous in their demeanour.The buffet had a wide array of choices and everything was replenished promptly. There was something for everyone to enjoy and we are looking forward to returning here in the near future
5
This is my 1st time having Sunday brunch at 10 Claymore. In term of varieties of food, that's not many to choose from. There are only cold seafood, sashimi,salad, hot food and dessert. But the quality is very good indeed (lobsters plenty and refilled constantly as there are quality oysters from NZ, Oz and USA). There is also steak menu on order such as Angus beef tenderloin, teppanaki style Angus ribeye. The service is exceptional waiters are always ready to take your order.
5
What really sets this place apart is the excellent and thoughtful service - whether it's the managers, Jay and Iqbal, or the waiters, or the chefs manning the stations. Everyone is warm and professional and willing to go out of their way to make the dining experience memorable. Special thanks to chef Andy, for making the perfect crepes and Penang Kway teow for my family - his warmth and thoughtfulness really made our day. Special thanks also to our waiter Animet, who was very attentive and helpful throughout our meal. The buffet spread is not the largest but super fresh oysters and quality food throughout makes the restaurant worth a visit

This is my first visit to this restaurant and I had an enjoyable dinner here. The beef served were my favourites. The oysters were good. The restaurant is highly decked by people and the waiters provided us with excellent service. Will definitely visit here again.

Very friendly reception & hospitality. Array range of food on display & service suit and cater well for the needs of most, if not all of 'diners' appetite and requirements.

This is my 3rd or 4th visit to this restaurant to eat their fantastic food in particular oysters there were 3 types of oysters freshly chucked by the chef when you request it, from USA (which is my fav) new Zealand and from France which is salty. The lobster full body was fresh and sweet but not the claws.However I would like to compliment the service personnel for their wonderful and good service in particular the supervisor Jay and Chef Andy who had kindly when found out I did not eat beef which was part of their wonderful plates of pleasure he kindly arrange their signature char Kway teow which was good.I will return again

This place is very nice and fancy, but the seafood choice not so good. I go with my gf and the waitress was not so polite to us. She like the tables of expats more than us.We try the seafood first. The shellfish was OK but nothing specials. Prawns better in Bangkok. Desserts good.Very expensive for what we got

I tried the buffet here this week. I love my seafood and was looking forward to a good feed of prawns, lobster etc. The place is nicely decked out, nice lighting and a good crowd. Started with salads which were OK and then to the main event - the seafood ! The prawns were utterly tasteless despite their size. I couldn't believe it so tried 4 or 5 - all the same. There was no lobster, no bugs, and the crabs were so small I couldn't be bothered. The fish was pretty good but didn't make up for the rest.Filled up on some great choccy desserts so all was not lost

10 @ Claymore (Pan Pacific @ Orchard)The restaurant is located adjacent to the main entrance of the hotel lobby. If patronizing the buffet, parking is complimentary. As of 10 June 2012, they’ll be under-going a 6-week renovation of the premises but the buffet will still go on at another location in the hotel. Reservations are a must due to the limited seating capacity. On a Saturday evening buffet, it was full house! There’s also a “MasterCard” offer on-going – 20% off the buffet price/pax. Check out the hotel’s website.We arrived earlier than the starting time but were shown to our table by the staff who also served us warm water. He then asked us to wait till he was given the OK by the kitchen that the buffet could start. The wait staffs were excellent throughout the dinner. The highlights of the food were – the seafood smorgasbord! Lobsters, oysters, mussels, scallops, prawns, a variety of sashimi, salt baked salmon, etc. All were fresh and always replenished on time. Oysters were shucked to your order, with 3 variety to choose from (Canadian, French or Irish). Ask if you do not like your oysters salty.There’s also an all-you-can-eat & cooked to order selection of organic tenderloin, sirloin, rib eye, lamb T-bone and salmon filet. I asked for medium-rare & the tenderloin came a bit on the chewy side. Maybe it’s because it’s organic?? The size of servings were just right to sample all, if you’re up for it.For dessert and durian lovers, try the durian crepe ……. it’s excellent! I had 2 of these!I’d return when I have the craving for lobsters. They’re truly worth the buffet price alone
5
I had dinner here on 17 April, and the 4 different types of oysters were fresh and delicious! So were the lobsters and crabs. This is a great outlet for fresh seafood, buffet style with unlimited helpings. The desserts were wonderful too and the Chefs personally came by our table to ask whether we were enjoying our food. Great service and excellent variety! i will definitely come back for more of this great value buffet
5
the best buffet dinner in a loooong time. Excellent array of seafood ranging from freshly shucked oysters to lobster to shrimp. Enjoyed 4 varieties of oysters from Ireland, France, Canada and US. The salt baked fish was just right - fresh and flavorful. They also had a la carte main dishes that you order as part of the buffet. The Penang Shrimp noodle was outstanding. The grilled beef was tender and delicious. And of course, the crepe was just the right dessert to cap the night.The service was outstanding. Dishes were removed quickly so we can go for our refill. We shall return

As I @ 10 at Claymore.......... A La Carte Penang Dishes, Buffet Breakfast Lunch & Dinner menu choice are superb it's tempting and tasty. The F&B Services was friendly from the Executive Chef Andy, Sous chef & The Breakfast Action counter Uncle Chef to the Restaurant Manager as well as the attentive waitresses. Kudos to all the PPO Hotel crews & management keep it up your super good professional attitude & excellent job well done. PPO Singapore BOLEH !!!!! :)

I liked their dessert, ice cream & crepe section best. I am sure most ladies would agree too. Even though I was full, I still went to grab more servings! They had a decent range of cakes to choose from. Though they had only 2 ice cream flavours, they had a lot of toppings on the table. I did not know they had a crepe counter. That was a pleasant surprise for me. There were many filling to select from, such as kaya, banana, cream, peanut, blueberry, strawberry, etc. I went there in the month of my birthday, so it was a one-for-one offer. Great discount
