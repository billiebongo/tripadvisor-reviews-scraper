They have very nice burritos here. It's a good place to have lunch and to have a quick bite. Definitely must try
5
Yummy food, but gets crowded! The food can get salty and it is good they have self serve water. The bin can get smelly so sit away from it
4
Many good eateries around here, but this one is not to badly priced, knocking out tasty simple yummy Mexican food. Fast service with a smile.
4
ordered tortilla and nachos, great food and friendly staff. the only area for improvement is i hope the table could be cleared on time.
5
Casual place for nice Mexican burrito. Nestled in the Keong Sian area where u can also check out other cool cafes as well! Definitely recommended! Be sure to add guacamole to your burrito!

@TheKuoKnowsVery atmospheric. Very authentic. Very affordable.Muchachos doesn’t seem like much on first impressions. But looks can be deceptive. Behind the simple serving counter are industrious cooks preparing some of the most appealing Mexican fare.The Tongue Burrito Bowl would have been my first choice, if it had been available. Unfortunately, it wasn’t. Maybe next time. The Beef was a very good second choice. It was cooked to just the right degree of tenderness. Just the right amount of heat.The bowl was more than adequate to sate a grown man. I had toyed with the idea of taking home the leftovers. But in the end, there was nothing left over to take home. I had polished off the lot.There are other Mexican restaurants in Singapore. But Muchachos keeps it real. Well done!

Hands down best quesadillas, as they're more like a giant juicy filled crunchy wrap than a flattened pitta. No nonsense fresh burritos and salad bowls, hearty and no frills and cheap to go everyday, which can be a terrible thing if you work so close to it
3
We ordered their new item, Barbacoa burrito and their popular Carne Asada fries. I ask for refried beans on my burrito, and maybe that was a bad idea. The burrito turn out to be very mushy, however, the Barbacoa was very tasty. The carne asada fries were such a great disappointment. The fries seems to have been refried over a hundred times as they were so hard, my gums were painful from just biting them. I decided to ditch those fries and ate those beef cubes with guacamole instead
5
Try their California Burrito or their Breakfast burrito to die for although no the authentic versions of a burrito but one of the best, they do carry authentic versions of burrito as well but who has time for rice and beans when you can have steak, cheese and fries.. Best comfort food.
5
It was surprisingly empty during our visit so our reservations were not really necessary, but i liked the fact that they addressed my name with a salutation since i was the one who made the booking.Prices are pretty reasonable and they have some free alcohol with some other purchases.
4
Place was easily accessible from mrt station. No frills , order and free seating. Not a very big place though.
4
One of the best Mexican food in town, would advise one to opt for the burrito as the salad bowl comes without the carbs but all at the same price (no additional vegetables either hmmm)?
5
Went to Muchachos for lunch and enjoyed the best burrito I have ever eaten in my life! Super relaxed, casual atmosphere and quick service. An absolute winner!
5
Though it was quite a walk from the MRT station, food was great! Tried the pulled pork and chicken burrito which was tender and full of flavor.
4
My party of 10 really enjoyed the food, guacamole was fresh and food quality is superb. Will be back
5
Never failed to visit Muchachos whenever my visit to SG. Was here for dinner & all tables was already filled up. Managed to squeeze in at a corner and shared the long table with others. Just like rain or shine it doesn't matter that we have it standing or seating as it really worth it since the burritos are so damn good and yummy...Service was excellent with friendly & courteous service team. Thumbs up !See u guys again in 2018...
2
Ordered the nachos, tacos, and burrito. The carnitas was very tough, dry and lacking in flavor. The food here tastes like it was prepared by someone who have not eaten real mexican food. The interior of place also looks very worn down. Saw many good reviews for this place, but I was disappointed that the food was not up to average standards. Hope the crew can take note and make relevant improvements
4
I love mexican food and this ticked almoet all the boxes. Delicious guacamole, well seasoned rice and salsa, quesadilla was rlly good, but unfortunately the pork filling was abit dry. Did not have a chance to try many other fillings, and i would like to go again!! Price wise, i think its moderately priced, defo not a weekly thing but priced are below $15 for everything, without gst and sv.
4
Muchachos is our favorite Mexican food joint outside of America for my friends and I! I usually get take out, but the ambience is cool and really lively.The food at Muchachos are really tasty and the portions are pretty big. My favorite items here are the carnitas quesadilla and the pescados burrito, which are jam packed with flavor and never fails to fill us up. Staff here are friendly and really efficient, especially the two ladies who always run the front of house! Even during peak periods, theyâ€™re really quick with your orders.Muchachos may not serve the best tasting Mexican food in Singapore, but it certainly has the best value with very affordable prices, large servings, and delicious food
5
I arrived on a Saturday noon for lunch. The place was not crowded at all so my orders were served in mere 5 minutes. The ambience was perfect. Each table had a unique set of beautifully designed tiles, hallmark of Mexican handicrafts. Add a sunroof that adds natural lighting into the eating area, each bite into my burrito was such a savoury.
5
Good food with good vibes. Excellent service. Burritos and burritos bowls are good however chips could be better. Nevertheless, affordable food and I'll come back more often. Reccomended place!!
5
Ordered carnes asada fries, pollo quesadilla and pork taco. Delicious and very filling. Wallet friendly too!
3
It was not a choice of mine to dine here but to respect a friend's birthday wish. Would have never opt for Mexican cuisine if possible. But the food tasted good actually. Great for a quick bite with friends.
5
The place is really cozy and i love the ambience. Food is worth the price and delicious. Really authentic.
4
though abit ulu location but the burritos are great! substantial portion for the price. good mexican food!
5
Food was good. Had the beef quesadilla. Noisy so don't expect to have a very private conversation here. Our table was a tad too close to the water dispenser. So people kept coming by. Will return to try the fish and shrimp!
5
KILLER food. The burritos, quesadillas, fries are to die for. Gets VERY busy on weekends, so be prepared to share tables. California burrito has pretty much everything in it!
5
This is my go to mexican place. Their carne asada quesadilla/burrito is the best. Cool ambiance, hipster place.
5
for me their california burritos is the best i have ever had. place might be a little be hard to find and full on weekend so i had to wait and share the table with other guests. but the tastes was awesome!
3
My friend and i ordered Quesadilla and California Burrito. Quesadilla was crispy, just that it is not cheesy enough. As for burrito, the wrapper taste a little like prata, a little different from the burrito i had back in USA. There isn't enough cheese and sour cream also. Despite that, the food is delicious and i will definitely visit again
5
Good ambiance, great place to hang out with friends!
Must try: California burrito, and beef con carne quesadilla.
5
The food was delicious and service was great. Will definitely return back again to try other combinations!
5
Muchachos is definitely one of my fav go-to joints for reasonably priced, fuss-free and delicious Mexican food. Portions are above average for a lady, which makes it value for money!
4
The nachos (with added guac) was enjoyable, especially so when shared among friends! Quite addictive and the portion was great for sharing.
3
On Thursdays, order a meal add a beer and you get another bottle of beer free! Good deal!
Overall food was OK. We had the California burrito and a pork burrito bowl. I've had better Mexican food in Singapore so this was just passable.
5
I had the super nachos, fish taco and pork taco. The salsa sauce given were very refreshing and has a nice tang flavour. Both the tacos and the nacos are highly recommended.
5
food is well worth the price :) very filling and delicious. Environment can feel a little cramp but everything is fantastic.
4
We took the kids here for some Mexican food and we all enjoyed a good California Burrito filled with steaks, fries, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. The young kids were able to tolerate the normal spiciness of the burritos.Service and wait time for the food were decent. I would highly recommend Muchacos for the Mexican fix
2
Ordered for two persons. One order came at a reasonable timing, the other order after 30 mins of waiting still didn't show up! After chasing, I found out, the stove was spoilt and they didn't bother informing. Later, they started the stove again and started getting orders out but again, not our order. Found out, they FORGOT my order! When the food finally came, it was completely WRONG. No apologies given, by then it was close to 1 hour of waiting. HORRIBLE SERVICE
5
Hi once again !! Muchachos is a Mexican Food restaurant ! I have a thing for Mexican food so yes. I love the food here not not because it's Mexican food but. Too most of the Mexican food I tried , Muchachos Food are delicious the atmosphere is great so lively clean and also the staff are friendly!!! It's location is abit hidden and the food are abit pricey but it's totally worth it. Great place to chill , drink , hangout and dine. Totally Worth the time this is a Must Try !! burritos! Nachos !! And a lot more do check them out. !!!
4
Muchachos should be the go-to Mexican Cali place for everyone. The chicken quesadilla never fail to please!
4
The food was good and the portion that they provided was very generous. I was really full with just a burrito.
4
Great portion, great value and DELICIOUS. Not a romantic place for first dates but a pretty cool place to hang out with buddies sisters and friends.
5
I've had fish, vegetarian, chicken, pork and lamb - for the price, the burritos are Super filling but tasty, tacos are fabulous, and quesadillas are great!! Great murals as well. A quirky, tasty restaurant!
5
We came here on a Thursday night, and the back room was heaving with cool, young Singaporeans and expats. The atmosphere was great, the burritos were massive, deliciou and shockingly cheap. It's a great place to load up with energy before hitting Mr Potato head or other trendy Keong Saik bars. If you're like me, and think that Singapore is the best place to eat in the world, but that it hasn't got casual western food right very often, then this is a great option. This is mexican version of hawker food, and should be proud of it
5
Came here for the second time to eat their burritos. Tried the carne asada and is amazing! I really miss Burritos since I left San Diego, and the taste here is great. Besides that, service is always very friendly and you get your food quite fast as well. Totally recommend
3
It does not open before noon during the week so be aware that you will wait if you get there early. This place has legit burritos and nice chicken tacos. I am still in the hunt for a great Fish taco for lunch and unfortunately this place is not it! They have everything for it except the fish is frozen type. Back to the good stuff. Great burritos but not cheap (11+ SGD). I find it disappointing that the chips ( not homemade) and guac are extras. To recap some things are good but in all a bit disappointing
5
Excellent food, good ambiance, stuff decent enough they are fast and efficient( but if they have that smile on their faces, it will be wonderful but I understand F&B can be quite tiring!) will definitely come again! But the margarita slushie portion could be abit more for the price!
4
By walking along the walkways, we couldn't find any signage indicating that this cozy establishment is Muchachos. Place is comfy, lighting is romantic, suitable for young social gathering. Kitchen is clean, staff is polite. Carne Asada Fries: brilliant, we love it; chewy beef, generous guacamole. Carnitas Burrito: HUGE burrito, biggest I've ever eaten; meat is hard to chew, taste is ok, messy. Watermelon juice feels like watermelon flavored juice, we're not sure. Overall, Okay.
5
The burritos was superb.. i order california burritos & guacamole and my mom order breakfast burritos.. both are so yummy.. worth every penny. The cons was just the seats we got seat right below AC and its not that comfortable for us. I haven't got time to taste tacos, but i will order it for sure for my next visit.
5
Cheap Mexican food worth the value to try. Sure to be back craving for more soon enough. Had their quesillda, was speechless when u try it.
4
Laid-back, chill ambiance. Good food, especially the nachos. The seating is slightly cramped though.
4
Best Mexican food I've had on the little red dot. Good value for money and nice little cantina to eat it in. Can't really recommend anything specific as their whole menu was great.
4
Reservation meant no waiting around for a table. The food was prepared quick and hot, and of course, super tasty.
5
The chickeb burritos are fantastic! The food portions are big, will suggest to share if you are a small eater.
5
Muchachos has by far the best burritos in Singapore. I am a Mexican food junkie and have eaten in most if not all the Mexican places in Singapore, and when it comes to burritos, these guys blow them all away. On the other hand, it is important to keep in mind that this is really a burrito stand with some seating in the back. It is not a sit down restaurant, you order at the counter and the bring the food back to a small, windowless self service area in the back. The seating area is fine for what it is, with cool cartoon murals painted on the walls and usually enough seating, but it is not a full service restaurant. Also, although they serve beer and frozen margaritas, they do not have a full bar. The menu is also pretty limited.If you are looking for an outstanding, reasonably priced burrito, you cannot go wrong. If you are looking for a more extensive menu, a full service sit down restaurant or a full bar, you probably should look somewhere else.My only complaint about Muchachos is that they don't deliver to my area
4
The food pricing is what draws people here and the restaurant tries to stay true to producing authentic Mexican flair, although the queue could get a little long and the space inside could be pretty full on a Friday night. But I love their full selection of Jarritos Mexican sodas and not to mention the Horchata drink which is not easy to find in Singapore!
5
Went there on 2 days back and had the California burrito - it was very good and reasonably priced.I was craving for it the following day (yesterday) and made my way back to Muchachos to try the steak burrito. To my dismay, it was closed on Sundays. I had to get my burrito fix at another burrito joint but was disappointed. The craving has gotten stronger
3
Definitely hit up Muchachos if you are craving some tex-mex, I haven't yet had a burrito anywhere else in Singapore that is as good (gap in the market!). I am only a bit disappointed in the order taking because they have confused Nachos with Chips & Guacamole the last two times that my colleagues and I have ordered there. Both items are on the menu, but Nachos is listed as "Super Nachos". If you just say Nachos without the "Super" you will get the "Chips & Guacamole" item. Overall a minor thing, but there is a big difference between the two dishes, and since we did take away, it meant I had to go back to exchange. Plus its a bit of a weird mistake to make (twice), especially after I corrected them when they repeated the order back to me. Maybe its the menu labels that need adjusting to avoid confusion, not sure. Luckily the food is decent and staff friendly. No compensation for your troubles though, and we found a hair in the nachos when I got back to the office, which topped this time off as a less than positive experience
5
It wasnt my first time visiting muchachos. I always order fish quesidilla which i recommended to a friend who visited for the first time and he loved it. I ordered vegetarian quesidilla and i was quite disappointed because it was too salty for my liking. Everything else was good, the atmosphere, the service, i would totally recommend this to all my friends
3
Good food, value for money, definitely a go-to to fix your Mexican cravings. Also, the staff were very welcoming and friendly.
5
Generous amount of meat served in the quesadilla. Don't worry if the lamb will taste good, because it is AWESOME; better than the beef in fact. Don't forget the tacos, and order loads of guacamole.
5
Good ambience and good food which does not cost too expensive. The burritos are filling and the quasidila was good. Try the steak for both. Great for after work chilling
5
If you want good burritos and a nice relaxed atmophere, this is the place. Already been here twice and I will visit again.
4
The food here is quite good. The theme of the restaurant is quite unique. The only down side to this is that it is very hard to find. The food is rather similar to those such as Chipotle from the US
4
I like the spot. The ambience is really cool, and the food here is good. They have a decent selection of Mexican food, and you can get your food fast to go or have a sit outside and have a quick bite.
4
Overall muchachos serves up decent mexican food in singapore. Try the buritos and quesadillas and good beer deals.
5
This is one place where the old adage "the best food is usually some hole in the wall place" certainly holds true. Walking by to miss this great little place, and has an initial ambience of an alleyway in downtown Los Angeles, rather than a Mexican restaurant. However if you walk past front countercounter and go into the back, they have a very nice and comfortable sitting area. I was craving tacos after my recent visit to Vatos Urban Tacos, decided to try this place. I have to say this is absolutely the best tacos in Singapore, maybe the best in Asia!!I got the pork tacos and the fish tacos. The pork was so tender and tasty and juicy I don't recall eating such wonderful pork meat. The fresh gradients balanced out the rest of the taco. Vatos is also tasty, but their meat is chewy.The fish tacos were perfectly battered and fried with great flavour. I will definitely be back here many times, in fact it may be my regular weekly hangout to chill with some comfort tacos and a cold beerHIGHLY RECOMMENDE
1
Have eaten Mexican food all around the world and even in Mexico. What they served wasn't Mexican.Could eat the food only cause of the cholula sauce and another spicy sauce they had. Quesadillas had no cheese. Only veggies. Tasted like a parathaBurrito was decent but not wowNachos was weird. No cheese sauce. Some cold sour yellow liquid on it ... could've been spoilt cheese or spoilt sour cream. God knows.Not worth visiting for sure
4
The place has great food and is reasonably priced. The service and the venue itself is nothing worth writing home about. Not bad at all but not stand out in a positive way either. Irrespective of that, if you want good Mexican, it's a great option. The burritos are the best thing on the menu
5
Very good.
Fast Mexican food. Not too much American as usually seen around. Good tacos, fair price, very quick, great ambience (young, students).
If you care for quick Mexican, don't wait. Go!
5
It's tasty, not expensive, been craving their carnitas quesadillas so we keep coming back. Delicioso! And they have cholula!
5
This is my go to place when I'm craving Mexican. It's unpretentious and the burritos are Delish! The menu is simple- a few different types of soft tacos and burritos, with nachos thrown in the mix. The restaurant is small in the size but the food is mighty in flavour.
5
My partner and I go here quite often - the service is fast, prices are cheap and the food is so tasty! We've tried a few things on the menu, but the Super Nachos are my favourite. I also recommend the frozen margaritas, also very affordable! The interior is super cool, loving the different colours, has a true Mexican vibe
4
The quesadilla is so good and crispy .... only need to remind them not to burnt it too long to have less burnt quesadilla. I think the tounge quesadilla is best although the fish quality is pretty good too; but the fish is just too much of deep fried. I wish the sitting area is nicer, not as stuffy like that
2
It's a Mexican self-service/fastfood, which means the service is what it is. The interior decoration is the bast part; tables and walls are unique and quite nice. The food though, bland. We had a chicken burrito and a beef burrito that tasted exactly the same. The wrap was chewy. Overall it wasn't bad or disgusting, but for 15 S$/burrito I would definitely walk somewhere else
3
I had the fish burrito (pescado burrito) and had no idea that it was fried.Staff was friendly to help me understand the ordering process (i.e. type of beans/ type of salsa)!Remember to opt for the salad bowl option if you want vegetables (ice berg lettuce), I wasn't aware & I ordered the rice bowl instead
5
Best burritos in town and very good price / performance ratio. Not often you find good Mexican food in this part of the world. They know how to do it. Rather casual setting and easy to go with friends. Good deals on beer on Thursdays. Sunday's closed.
4
We've been in Singapore for a week and I've eaten here three times. It's very close to our hotel and it's been nice to walk down and grab a burrito for lunch. I've always ordered a chicken burrito with guacamole. The food is fresh, hot and made to order. It literally takes 5 minutes to get your food and you're on your way.I've always gotten the food to go but I will say the place looks cute. The staff has always been friendly and easy. I would totally go again
1
Welp. After walking around for over 30 minutes in the sticky, hot Singapore evening trying to fill my empty belly I came across Muchacho's on Yelp. Allegedly they have some of the best authentic Mex in the eastern hemisphere. Too bad I will never know. I get to this place, and the queue is about four people long. I wait my turn, get to the register, only to be cut off by a Caucasian male who wanted a side of guac. Instead of waiting his turn like the rest of us, he was privileged enough to skip the line and get his order taken. I look on in disbelief as the girl behind the register motions for me to wait. Nope. I and the two people behind me turned around and left. I will starve before I give my money to a business that, foremost, doesn't value my time and treats me like a second class citizen. Obviously the people behind me agreed, or simply weren't impressed with the menu. Either way they missed out on a profit that would have been far more than the 2 measly bucks that the guac cost the guy. Do so much better, Muchacho's
3
Looking for chipotle, found this ! Different style, but mexican tastes good.. Seem more like a take away place.. Weird timings though, found it closed in evening few times..
4
This will truly satisfy your Mexican cravings. Long queue but worth it. I suggest you come on less peak times to get a better seat. Big servings. The ambience though was noisy and crammed inside.
5
off the beaten path but still MRT accessible. This is a cult secret and I now know why. This place rivals San Diego's best, and will be a target when I return. Nice work folks. You've scored! The fish tacos and chicken burritos rock.
1
I had the steak burrito n my Wife the pork that was recommended by another patron but both were so disappointing! The burritos were just stuffed with nothing of substance let alone Mexican with good Flavours.
5
There are not many establishments capable of producing a quesadilla that will have you dreaming about it. Craving it whenever one's vulnerable and hungry. Scratch that. This is the only place so far that makes me physically craving for another whenever I've not visited this place in awhile.A biweekly tradition at this point, I've brought so many new people to this semi-hidden gem for lunch during the hottest of hours. Despite the lack of parking and breeze, a trip to this establishment is always well worth it.I'll put it simply. Quesadilla's here can't be matched by many other establishments in SG. Best ones are the steak and beef tongue. The fish is quite decent, if you do not let it sit for too long, lest the breading gets mushy.Burritos wise, the pork burrito is amazing, and even better in a burrito bowl if one is feeling up for a thousand and two calories at one sitting. Seriously this thing is massive. We're talking a pie dish. Like an actual pie dish filled 3/4s to the brim with meat and beans and rice and guac.Speaking of guac, please do yourself a favour and add it to your meals.Gonna go get me some tacos soon. Never tried em as I never can fit both a quesadilla AND taco in the same sitting. But they looked amazing when I picked up my food.Remember, this has a fast-food ticket concept, so don't go expecting 5 star service and food. But for the price you can't really go wrong
4
Brought my mum for her first taste of carnitas burrito bowl and super nachos set! I've tried almost everythkng on the menu from tacos to quesadillas to burritos. And they have been amazing. Tried the burrito bowl for the first time today and it was refreshing and totally yummy! Less filling than a burrito but to be fair i shared it with my mum. The super nachos was awesome. Disappeared real quick. Muchachos is awesome for their freshly made guacomole and they never disappoint! If the avocados arent ripe they wouldnt serve guacamole. True that! And it goes best with a Corona and momsie had freshly squeezed (technically cant squeeze watermelon can you? Lol) watermelon juice. Definitely recommended place to go for lunch and catch up with friends! :
2
Thumbs down :/I used to be a very frequent customer before this place underwent a menu and layout reboot. This is still some of the best Mexican food you can get in SG, but there are major drawbacks when compared to what it used to be. I used to come here twice a week, and now it's once a quarterGOOD:* New layout facilitates group social interaction more effectively. Old format was basically a bar that wrapped around the restaurant perimeter, which meant any groups beyond 2-3 people were really inconvenient* A few new menu items are nice--like the loaded nachos* burritos are still tastyBAD:* New format forces the queue outside the door, which is both uncomfortable for customers and creates the illusion of popularity* kitchen is now completely closed off, which makes it a lot harder for you to customize how the burrito is made, which is contrary the primary advantage of what the Mission Bar concept. Two thumbs down on this* ironically, despite the lower degree of customization for your order, in my experience it now takes them several times longer to prepare your food, which you still need to sit and wait for or hope you can hear when they yell your order from down the hall.* no fountain soda. they used to offer this, and now they don't. particularly annoying is that they don't compensate for this by providing bottled sodas (e.g. coke light). Instead you need to go down the street to the 7-11 and smuggle it in or resign yourself to shooting small cups of complementary tap water
4
We walked passed this place at least two times, while looking for it. It´s a very small place from the outside, so a bit hard to find. The quesadillas were really good and big. Good value for money. We had extra guacamole. The atmosphere was nice. But this is not a place where you stay for long - you order, you pay, you eat, you get on with your evening.
4
New and revamp!!! Mexican vibes all over the place, I always drop by this place for a quick bite. The Burrito is pretty huge for 1 serving so i suggest you go with a partner if not order the quesadilla. Affordable and worth every penny (
4
Not a fan of tex mex but this place isn't too bad (on a Monday night). I had the chicken quesadilla with guacamole and though it cost me $12.50, the serving was huge. The filling was juicy and the guacamole made all the difference. The quesadilla wrap was actually quite crispy, almost like a cross between a prata and a naan. I can see this place filled with expats, tourists and visitors on weekends, so probably best to go on a weekday
4
This place serves very good mexican food. Burritos are spicy and taste lot better than other mexican places in Sg. The ambience is bit dull, but taste is good.
4
This is Singapore's version of Chipotle. It will satisfy the craving for Americans abroad and in need of a burrito (as much as anything here can). Thursdays are great for the burrito and beer special.
2
Muchachos was a nice, casual place we used to frequent to grab good Mexican food.Sad to say that our recent experience was quite a contrast.The new wall colors and the dim seating area feel less-than-welcoming.But we were most disappointed by the lack of guacamole. When asked why it wasn't available, the staff merely informed us that they didn't have any ripe avocados. I feel this could've been planned better as a Mexican meal is incomplete without guacamole
3
Limited menu but I enjoyed the food, too much chilli for my mum and Mr Fussy the 8 year old. Seats are really uncomfortable and it's a call out system, they don't bring it to your table. Much cheaper than some of the fancy restaurants in the area
3
This was one of my favourite joints when it first opened. Service was friendly and the food was on point all the time with generous portions. Since then, things have changed. The meats are under-seasoned and the staff seem disinterested. Nonetheless the burritos are still slightly above average and worth the visit as I work nearby. Fingers crossed that the new refurbishment of the space will spur them to re-look at the menus as well
4
Coming from California, I am spoiled by cheap and delicious Mexican food. Finding a place that does that decently is hard to come by in Singapore. My good buddy living there now took me here to try the breakfast burritos, which he swears by. While not Mexican by nature, it was a solid breakfast burrito. $10+ for some eggs, potatoes, and sausage in a warm tortilla was a bit steep for me, but it's Singapore. I tried a quesadilla on a subsequent visit and it was good - get it fully loaded
1
Me and my friends used to come here probably once a month, bring the closest Chipotle clone here in SG, but the food quality has become from bad to worse.My pet peeve - the Carne Asada beef. It was much better last year before they started changing the kind of beef, and the taste doesn't have the zing into it anymore.Service seem to be lacking as well, even though I understand this is a self-service restaurant. Last week was my last straw: They made me wait 20 mins for my meat, and when the kitchen brought out my beef they gave it to someone else instead!!! Talk about being pissed off.Back then I used to say "This is the best burrito joint in SG" and worth the price. Now I'll say "it's not worth it anymore."Sorry Muchachos, but I'm off finding another love
4
Food is no doubt good. A serious must try in Singapore. I wish there is a choice for smaller portions though. 1 burrito can last me lunch and dinner. I still buy it because I love the burrito and have no other choice. I eat their burrito once a month... maybe with smaller portions, i could do it more often? My tummy can only handle so much. hahahah
5
This place is simple, focused on the essentials, and flat out delicious.The concept is a fast food self-service Burrito assembly line, similar to Subway Sandwich. The choice is Burrito or Quesadilla; then your choice of pork, beef, chicken, or veggie.Then the condiments such as rice, beans, etc. Finally pick your sauce.The flavour is authentic TexMex (nope, not Mexican). The serving size is also typically American, large enough for two to share if you're only after a light meal or snack. See the picture to make your own judgement :-)We had the chicken and pork Burrito, both fantastic, especially the pulled pork.This place wins my 5 star vote for doing only a few things and doing them extremely well... oh and the fact that they have self-serve Cholula Hot Sauce helped too.Btw, there are no tables to sit and eat. Only a wall mounted bar with stools
3
I love Mexican and after hearing of this new(ish) place, I decided to give it a try. I was a little sceptical at first because of its location in the gentrifying hipster enclave of Keong Saik Rd. However, putting all this aside, I tried the chicken burrito with guacamole added to the filling. I wish they had made it clear that each topping was an extra. By the time I got the burrito and a pitifully small helping of nachos, I was out of S$19 or so (that was before any drinks). Not that the burrito itself was bad (in fact, it was actually quite good), but even in Tokyo, similar burriterias cost far, far less

It's great!!!!! Big burritos, wonderful guajamole and fair prices. Just 15$ to get a tasty burrito with extra cheese and a glass of fresh water. The right place forma friends meeting. No table just rating on the bar. You must try it.

Not much to say, for $20 you will feel like your taco before you eat it, about to explode, what a taco, stuffed till the limits, you must get the challenge and eat it all. Enjoy manito.

Love the friendly staff and boss, and the food is excellent. Friends whom I have brought there like it too.

We love Muchachos -- from the hip vibe, to the delicious food, to the owners and staff who are doing their best to bring real Mexican food to Singapore. The menu is simple and delicious because Jonathan and Elson are doing their best to serve authentic burritos and quesadillas, without over-complicating things. The interior is similarly cool and uncomplicated -- pull up a bar stool, crack a beer and tuck in. Exceptional taste, love and value for money in every bite

I rated it very good because it is hard to find half way decent Mexican food in Singapore without paying a lot. Please remember I am from Texas so maybe a little picky. We had friends and all was good. The pork did not have a lot of flavor but was still good. The problem. If there is a lot of people it takes a long time and the portions are really too big. I would pay the same for something smaller and more reasonable. Price for what you get is great but just too big! Also, no tables, you sit at a bar

Being a big fan of Chipotle back in the US, Muchachos is the closest thing we have in Singapore to getting that. On hipster/foodie street Keong Saik Road, the outlet is set on the ground level of a shophouse, but the moment you step in you get hit with modernity as the interior (polished concrete walls, cool and funky lighting) is anything but old and historic. I've come here off and on over the last year (most recently in May) and find the ingredients and quality pretty darn good for what you get. Nothing like washing down a nice Burrito filled with quality ingredients with a Jarritos soda or imported microbrew. The only thing I have found is sometimes (emphasis on SOMETIMES) the meat can be a tad bit on the dry side. Everything else otherwise is pretty delicious and decent. It may not be the best burrito you'll ever eat, but if you are having a craving for Chipotle this will definitely cure that and hit the spot and not put a major dent in your wallet either

My most memorable experience of Mexican food in singapore! Previously been to two Mexican restaurants in holland village, but this place really takes the cake! I tried the chicken and carnitas (pulled pork?) burritos, which are basically a wrap with meat, seasoned rice, salsa, beans (chilli), sour cream and habaneros sauce. Really generous servings and love that they have "Wings Wednesdays" where you can get buffalo wings for 50cents each. A great spice fest as well, especially enjoyed topping the burritos with mindblowing sriracha sauce at the side. Will definitely be back for more

If you're longing for Chipotle back in the US this is as close as it gets here in SG. You're definitely going to miss US prices, but once you bite into it, that all fades away. I've taken a few dates here, and even the most petite of dates finishes every bite. On average, it takes me about 30 minutes to get there by MRT and its always worth the trip

After asking could I have a half chicken half beef burrito I was curtly told "we don't do that here"I explained price wasn't a problem,reply was "these are our rules" I settles for chicken,ordinary at best,disappointing experience,so I have my own rule now,don't support eateries that employ upstart staff with unfriendly strict "don't think outside the box rules" plenty of other places in Singapore who are happy to oblige

The location is great, near to many fancy bars and shophouses that create a wonderful atmosphere. Even if Muchachos is more a fast food than a restaurant, the environment is very sophisticated and deserves a try. Burritos are very good, I tried the chicken and beef ones, and they weren't too spicy for my taste. Maybe service is not that great, but it makes sense considering the kind of place. Give it a try

We found this restaurant though trip advisor and were impressed by its reviews. We were not disappointed! We had veggie burritos- which were delicious! They were huge and great value! The staff were really friendly too.

We're Americans who've been living in Singapore for 6 years -- this is the first affordable Mexican food option we really liked. Staff was friendly and helpful. We had a nice, casual meal at one of the outdoor tables. We'll definitely be back.

After three trips to Mexico, we're probably as qualified as most to report our delight at finding a Mexican restaurant, with authentic cuisine, in Singapore. This little burrito bar creates unique meals to your own taste. We enjoyed quesadillas and burritos, seated on bar stools under a constellation of retro light bulbs. It's an upmarket ambiance, with helpful, friendly service and great food. At my age, I'd have preferred seating and tables... but the boys (and gals) at Muchachos have done really well given the size of the premises. We'll be back

I was so happy to have found this restaurant. Am usually very skeptical of Mexican food in Singapore and am really not that big of a Mexican food fan but this place blew me away. Love their fish burritos and they have a nice selection of hot sauces to go with them. Something I would recommend you try if you are there with a big appetite are the breakfast burritos. They are massive and packed with eggs, sausages and even hash browns, absolutely amazing! Atmosphere is great and you can get beers for a pretty reasonable price as well

Muchachos has definitely stunned us with their amazing burritos. My girlfriend and I tried the Chicken and Beef burrito and we can definitely say that it is one of the best in Singapore. Love the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant. We were kind of sad as the guacamole was sold out and were a little hesitant to eat it because be are a HUGE guacamole fan but as soon as we took our first bite. We were just stunned. There is just one thing to be taken noted of as the quesadillas were holding up the line a little but besides that, everything was great. Quality service, quality food. We will definitely be back and will bring more friends from the US here when we first touch down. Keep it up, Muchachos. Also thanks to TripAdvisor where we found out Muchachos from. Cheers

Sorry , both my wife and I got ill after eating Muchachos burritos. during the night we both had severe cramps and each visited the toilet many times in the next 12 hours...... The common thread Muchachos. Very nice staff but something has gone wrong with this restaurant as it's quality has seriously declined since we first tried it. Our first sampling , it may have rated as 5.5. This one a 2 !Oil and fat are not the basis of Mexican cooking, (the chicken was dripping in the stuff). Spices are, and Muchachos has cut these to a minimum. Everything tastes the same as the next thing. AND , NO SALADS or standard guacamole, and only TWO salsas.ONE WORD....ORDINARY. and going from our experience possibly dangerous..... Sorry, all those glowing reviews ? Obviously the writers haven't tried Mex in the USA , Chipotle blows it out of the water. Even Baja Fresh in SIngapore is better- especially for flavour and appropriate spicing.Stop pretending you are a Mex restaurant, take some Mex cooking lessons, then re open .PS; please test the temperature of your storage systems- has to be below 4 degrees fellas or microbes can breed

We really needed a break from the asian food and founded this place in Singapore's Chinatown. The burritos are good quality and well loaded and of good quality, a "normal" burrito was too much for my spouse ;-). Selection of beers is a bit limited - Sorry, but Budweiser/BudLight won't cut it - even at the huge discount offered! Corona was fine, but pls. try to source a Tecate or Dos Equis! Prices are ok. Staff was very friendly, the place has sort of an "industrial" atmosphere which may feel weird for a burrito joint

I'm used to Chipotle and Qdoba style burritos in the US, and this is in line. I thought Muchachos was better than some of the other burritos I've had in Singapore - with some interesting twists and new flavors that we don't typically have in the US. They cooked the cheese onto the tortilla, which i don't think i've seen before. I live near Chinatown, so when I'm in the mood for a decent burrito this is likely where I will go. It's not anything extraordinary, but if you're looking for a straightforward burrito joint, you'll find it here. The service is a little slower than the American fast-casual burrito places; not bad - it doesn't feel like they're not rushing you through the line which is fine unless you're in a hurry. One note - on its own the burrito was not particularly spicy. It was very flavorful, but not heavy on the spice. That worked ok for me, but you may want to grab the Tabasco if you need a little heat

We had lamb burritos and they were very tasty. Sitting outside while enjoying the big burrito was a real pleasure.SGD12 for a big burrito is a fair price. However, we find it strange that we have to pay SGD2 extra for guacamole, which should be the standard for preparing burritos. Next time we will not take the pineapple topping, as this made the burrito taste like a Hawaiian pizza.We will certainly go there again and again and again..

Having practically lived on burritos throughout my college years in the SF Bay Area, I was naturally intrigued when I kept hearing the name Muchachos come up among my circle of friends. And after my virgin visit earlier today, I finally understand why. I could go on and on about how they do so many things right (in contrast to their local peers), but I'll spare everyone the needlessly verbose details and just say this: Muchachos is serving the real deal.As someone from the traditional school of thought that every taqueria should rightfully be judged by its carnitas, I wasted little time in getting a pork burrito assembled. Needless to say, I was absolutely blown away. With some gut space left after, I decided to try my hand at something a little more pedestrian and ordered a chicken burritino. Expectedly, it didn't pack as intense a flavor as the carnitas, but the pollo asado did still possess a smoky sweetness.I also managed to have a brief chat with the owner Jonno and it literally doesn't take more than a few seconds for anyone to tell that this is a man who is intensely passionate about his burritos and knows exactly what he's doing. All in, Muchachos is a must-visit for any burrito lover
