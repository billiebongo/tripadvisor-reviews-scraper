This place May seem touristic but it is really excellent. Food is really tasty and portions are quite large. Staff is very friendly and familiar. We can definitely recommend!

It's located at an historical street.. many tourist around the place.. and nice location too.. friendly staffs.. they have variety of food in the menu.. and the foods are delicious. Service was good.. I would go again

Great Street with atmosphere but unfortunately not to recommend in regard of food and service
We had great Service throughout Singapore but not at this place

Well-fined turkish resto right on Arab street.
Generous portion better seen "live" than not on the menu.
I had hummus and kebab, excellent!

We went with a big group and therefore got to sample many dishes. The breads and chicken skewers were delicious! The beef and lamb were a bit dry. The eggplant was tasty, resembled eggplant Parmesan. The best was the fried noodle dessert with tea. Absolutely great! The location near Arab Street and the friendliness of the wait staff add to the experience
4
This is a nice (but touristy) area in the Arab Street precinct. A man stands out the front politely but constantly trying to "reel in" customers. There were 8 of us and I thought the food was quite good although perhaps on the pricey side of the reasonable band
4
We ganged up and made our way down to the most beautiful street of singapore The Arab Street and decided to have our dinner at Derwish as offer made by gentleman was attractive and thats the secret if you want to know what could be the offer so make you way doen and experience it.Well we been munching while walking around and for dinner just order decent meal mode instead of the barbarians mode lolx and food taste here is good and drinks were nice and must try desert and turkish coffee its awesome. Food prepared is fresh as you taste and tell its totally different from the rest of singapore's foods.The atmosphere is very good and you can see thr most beautiful open sky and colorful street and amazing Mosque

Food was average. However reason for negative review is there was a poor lady waitressing tonight who was clearly very ill - coughing and spluttering every 5 seconds and who should have been at home not infecting everyone’s food. We mentioned to the manager on leaving and he said “she didn’t tell me she was ill”...wl she didn’t tell us or any of the other customers either but it was pretty obvious!
4
W e were greeted by a lovely gentleman asking if we wanted lunch , he was not pressuring which made us stop here . the staff were quick and friendly , the décor was perfect for the restaurant and it was very clean inside and out .The menu had a lot to pick from and there was so much food you wanted to try .We ordered the vegetarian eggplant and a chicken dish ( cant remember the name )The food did not take too long to come out and it was delicious .I normally like a beer with my lunch but this restaurant is Halal so there is no alcohol ( just a foot note ) I would defiantly come here again and I think it would be a lovely dinner venue too
5
I lived in Turkey for some time . After visit of Derwish i felt myself back in Turkey !deliouse food, big amount of food , fast serving time . First dish came in 5 min . If you want to eat quike and tasty come to this awesome place . Not pricy
2
Good location, nice ambience. Food is below average, hummus was not fresh, when we complained, they were nice enough to acknowledge and replace! Expensive for the quality, unlikely to go back

Very good meal next to the Sultan's mosque. The staff was very polite (we had 4 kids...) and the air conditioning was a saver.

This was my first time dining there, and definitely the last. Don't know what's the hype with this restaurant but guess customers are better off dining at other Turkish restaurants in the vicinity.Their service system was very messy; there was apparently no proper system of service coz customers who arrive later get served first. We waited for 30 mins just to get our hummus served (I would have expected hummus to be the fastest dish to be served). Ambience was horrid; super noisy, which actually gave me a tension headache because of the noise.The food was very average; we were served burnt pita bread in which we had to get it changed (see pic). How could they serve burnt bread to customers??In addition, the food prices were expensive. 2 desserts, 1 hummus with chicken kebab and 2 drinks came up to around SGD60. Ridiculous! This will be the last time I will dine there. With that amount of money spent, I'm sure it could be better spent at other restaurants in the vicinity
5
We were here two times during our stay in Singapore. The food was amazing, we didn't have to wait long and the service was great. Such friendly staff. You can chose turkish food or lebanese food from their other restraunt across the street. Worth a try whenever you're in Singapore
4
the food at Derwish is always constant, very good. Only quirk was that they had run out of tabouli - it seemed very strange for a middle eastern restaurant!! but the other salad we ordered was just as yummy (we had been here before so knew some of the dishes). Also because the weather was not raining or too hot, sitting outside watching the world walk by whilst enjoying our delicious food was relaxing. One annoying factor; the doorman needs to let people look at the menu, without trying to rope them in - it is a put-off to most prospective patrons. However, the kebabs were amazing and just love their homemade lemonade. We will definitely come back when next in Singapore and would recommend to others.

Looking for a light lunch my wife and I entered the air conditioned comfort of this restaurant. We arrived about 11.45 and there were only a few tables occupied. Service was reasonably fast and we ordered two vegetarian dip style dishes and bread, with fruit drinks. Our meals were very good, portions were large and prices reasonable. The restroom was clean and nicely presented. Recommende
3
Food is quite good but prices are high, presumably mostly because the waiters spend far more time trying to rope in the next customer than to serve the ones they've already seated. After finally placing our order, we watched our waiter chase after three groups of potential customers before, after we reminded him, he finally took our order to the kitchen. And everyone else there experienced the same thing. Get better food at a much better price on one if he adjoining streets.
2
Good ambience and we are a fan of little Arabia. Place was full. Squeezed in. 10 mins till order taken. Some 30 mins more before food turned up. Starter with mains. Mains tasty and well presented but luke warm so we assume it had sat in the kitchen for a while. There were some four men working front of house but I only saw one waiter and very little food coming out. Probably a decent enough place if they sorted out their workflo
4
I was drawn by the pretty tables at this restaurant and the pics on the menu looked nice. Had hummus and ekmek for starter. Was delicious. Had Ayran to drink which was interesting! Mains all arrived at different times - one friend finished before others started- and my friend's dish was the wrong one. I had stuffed aubergine (can't remember the Turkish name) and it was piping hot and very filling. Not sure if it was what you would get in Turkey but was tasty and very filling. The setting was really lovely and at dusk the view of the mosque and hearing the prayer to call was really unique in Singapore. Probably would go here again just cos I like the decor so much. Staff friendly and helpful.

We came to this Restaurant thinking maybe could be good even if is in very turistic place but was a disappointment. I order a musaka and my husband order a different plate... musaka is supposed to be full of flavor and tons of species but this one no... a tomato onions salt sauce... completely plain... funny thing my husband dish tatsted exactly the same as mine, it was just served differently. This is a poor Turkish food not value for mone
1
Meat was not fresh. Vegetables too. Everything was cold. Portion was a bit small.
Very expensive.
Touristic Street.
5
The food here is very nice. Definitely recommended. Seven of us and we all enjoyed. A return trip is needed.
2
The food was average. Very fatty tasting & quite expensive for what you get. People were smoking at the tables outside. Went there for the Turkish experience but it didn't seem to deliver. Left disappointed
2
Look, the place is beautiful ok. Location is best and if you're visiting Arab street, you might inevitably get tempted to try some turkish or arab food. If you decide to enter here, try the appetizers, a drink and leave. Food is not that good and is definitely not worth the money you pay for it
5
I loved this place. We shared an appetizer platter with a lovely selection of falafel, different sauces and salads. I had lamb shish kabobs which came with vegetables and rice. They were juicy, perfectly cooked and delicious and the service was great. The man was so helpful and made sure we always had enough drinks, napkins, etc. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the tables are beautifully colored with tiles. Would highly recommend. A great place for business or casual, date or lunchtime.
5
We only wanted a light lunch so shared a Mezze plate. It was fantastic. The bread, dips and Mezze were so good. The flavours were all so different and very enjoyable. The wifi was also good and the location is great to sit and peole watch
5
Fabulous ambiance and delicious food. This is one of my fav restaurants in Singapore and the evening ambiance of this place is simply wonderful, almost dreamy. Food is so authentic, one could close their eyes, take a mouthful and taste like as if they are in Turkey itself
4
This is a terrific little spot in the Arab Street area. We stooped to get cool in the air conditioning and had some great appetizers and mint tea smoothies- which I highly recommend. The Saksuka dip is some of the best I've had. Hummus was perfect. My friend got a little turkish special pizza they make that was awesome. Decor was nice. Service was excellent. I'd go back in a heartbeat
5
We ate here outside under an awning while a thunderstorm raged and the rain pelted town. This and the muzien calling from the neighbouring mosque as we ate made for a truly memorable evening. The food was delicious - the falafel was the best we have ever had (light and fluffy clouds). No alcohol being Muslim but that is no hardship when the fresh teas and juices are this good. A firm recommendation.
2
We regretted our decision to eat here from the moment we sat down. One of the staff was eating a meal and smoking (despite non smoking laws) at the table next to us. The menu had random Italian items as well as Turkish (we came for the Turkish experience). The food was very ordinary and was of low quality ingredients. Despite this, it was still more expensive than the restaurant we went to at Marina Bay Sands the next night.
4
Derwish serves good Lebanese & Mediterranean food. Service is prompt and the overall decor is great. Price point - mid-range.
5
A friend recommended the food - the food was fantastic. I love their tea. Was busy and service was slow.
5
Stopped for a late lunch. Food was divine, thoroughly enjoyed it. We had the lamb pide, falafel and meze tabagi plate to share. Very generous serves. Service a little slow but worth the wait
5
Went for lunch with friends. Delicious and fresh turkish food, good service, clean and beautiful decor. Worth a visit.

There are so many middle eastern restaurants to choose from in this area. I chose this one as I was dining by myself and there were already plenty of other diners in the restaurant. I had two dishes, both of which I wasn't overly impressed with. Each time I wanted to order something or to get my bill I had to wait patiently for someone to come past my table as the staff were more concerned with getting more punters in than serving the ones that were there already. I doubt I will come back to this one as I have eaten at better restaurants in the same area
1
I went there to make my colleagues discover Turkish foods. What a disappointment: basics such as hummus and tabbouleh are tasteless and tasted stale and not fresh. Sauces for the meat were weird, meaning no specific distinct flavour though the colour was bright. Meat is OK only, it tasted good compared to the rest BUT really was nothing special. Apart from the nice setting, the food is really not up to tasty Turkish food. Just don't go there!
4
Lovely food served and the taste is real authentic. Great menu with loads of variety and lovely dessert menu too. Bonus of sheesha add to the charm of the place. Service has to be improved drastically when there is too much rush and they are not able to manage it properly.Nevertheless great food to eat
4
Had the spiced rack of lamb and the borek filled with feta cheese . Both were excellent . The lamb tender and juicy and the borek was much better tasting than the spring rolls served locally . The big plus ? The ambience of the place .
3
Visited this restaurant with Wife, son and daughter in law during the Ramadan period. Had Turkish kebabs and some of the baked Mediterranean dishes. food wasn't great but the exquisite view of the Sultan Mosque added to the experience. The street was over all bustling with energy and festivity.
5
Derwish offers an extensive menu of Turkish style food and all of it went down well. From the beautiful fresh salad to the mixed platters of seriously tasty lamb and beef it was an eating fest. Topped off with a great desert and some interesting teas. Being close to the Mosque you may hear the call to prayer and it just adds to the feeling of being away from Singapore
4
Delicious Turkish fare! Food was delicious and sumptuous! Wait staff also were prompt and attentive.
5
Good thing we didn't check the reviews prior our dine. Not sure why there were bad reviews, but we had an amazing experience! The service was great! The food was delicious! Especially, the hummus and the skew lamb!! Loved it!
3
Great view onlooking Arab Street and the Sultan Mosque absolutely amazing. Shisha is extremely pricey at $55 including taxes! Shisha will be banned at the end of July 2016. Have a walk around the street loads of restaurants and pick what you fancy really! Great for a walk follow on from Haji Lane and local MRT Bugis Station is around a 15minute walk away.
4
We ordered limited food. Babahannuc,Humus, PIDE and Islim Kebab. No drinksTotal Cost was SGD79. Quantity was okay and quality goodWe chose this as it had maximum number of people earning at that time. Was Saturday 4pm.Serving was bit slow. Some of the staff was eating at that time
1
5 of us went for iftaar today The guy taking order pushed us to take iftar kebab platter for 5 of us.. sgd 25 per person. Mentioned big one platter enough for 5. When platter came there 5 seekhs/skewers (2 veg and 3 non veg). Very less food for 5. On normal days one dish of sgd 25 normally serves 2 seekhs/skewers. We have had food at many turkish restaurants and 2 seekhs/skewers of kebab for sgd 25 is standard. There for iftaar set menu of these 5 seekhs, they charged sgd 125!!!! Its complete rip off!!! Please avoid dining at all cost. May be go only for sweets/desserts!!! Sofra and Amirahs grill far better options! At least you dont get robbed or cheated!!!!

Strolled down Arab street, soaking up the atmosphere... The street is a little more touristy than it used to be, and perhaps that is reflected in my experience below. We walked down from the mosque and saw Derwish on the right. Nice looking place, and a friendly chap standing outside, encouraged us to sit. So we did.We ordered home made lemonade (really sweet) and a mixed meze appetizer. It was pretty good, and we sat and watched the tourists go by. I also noticed that the waitstaff were mainly focused on getting more people into the restaurant, rather than looking after those already inside. It did kind of cheapen the experience, sitting outside. The mains arrived: a mixed bbq platter which was reasonable but nothing special, and the house special a dish called Iskender, When I've had this dish before (in Turkey) its a beautiful, rich dish: here it simply didn't work. The bread tasted hard and stale: the lamb was over-cooked and dry, and the tomato sauce tasted suspiciously as though it was just emptied out of a can: sharp and acidic with no additional seasoning. None of the flavors had blended - it tasted as though it had been hastily thrown together two minutes before serving. So - if you go to Arab street - try somewhere else: there are many choices. And if you are tempted with Derwish, stick to the appetizers, watch the world go by, and eat your main course elsewhere
4
Came here for dinner with work friends. Place looked pretty good from the outside as we wandered down Arab Street. Very welcoming staff and nicely set up. Despite service being slow and didn't realize BYO till after we'd ordered, was still a great night. Had traditional drinks and ordered the banquet. The food wasn't exactly what we expected, quite bizarre setup, (think huge casserole dish with food in side covered in pastry with skewers sticking out of it. But amazing food! So much of it, we couldn't finish it. Really tasty and worth it
2
Food just average, very disappointed as I took friends there after eating in this area previously where food was better quality. Watch the drinks as we pointed at $3 cost and were given $6.50 drinks. Service cost $12.50 for 4 people a bit over the top. Not value for money. Sorry Derwish lost my future business.
2
My wife and I visited Derwish a year ago, attracted by the cheerful bouncer, and had a great meal. This time we were a bit disappointed. The lamb knuckle tajin was cold, and we had to ask to heat it. No apologies, but we got it reheated. Else a good place.
2
Service - very poorWhen you walk in front of the Mosque in Arab Street and pass Derwish most of the staff is more focused on pitching new customers to get in the restaurant than actually taking care of their own customers. Knowing this, we had booked a table before arriving. We had to 1st wait 10min before a server said "hello", than another 30min before we could be seated: not at their restaurant (as they had not kept a table for us despite the booking) but at the restaurant in front (probably from the same owner). We were never served one of the dish ordered (although it figured on the final bill), they did not bring the right bill and it took 20min to sort it out. We also had to ask 5 times and 3 different waiters and wait 1hour before getting water.Food - OkayThe food was good but the quantities were very small despite high prices
4
I had a very good experience at this restaurant. They were very accommodating to fix a special dish thT my granddaughter would eat. The location is good for shopping on Arab Street and is very close to the Suktan Mosque.
2
Hard food
nice decorations
bad service and expensive
the meat Pide is tasteless and hard
the hummus also not good
with hard bread
staff good but not more
3
There is no shortage of choice of restaurants in this part of Singapore: we plumped for Dewish. Nothing wrong with it but equally nothing particularly special.
1
Waited for 2 hours for our foods. In btw, Keep serving the wrong dishes to us for more than 4 times.
2
Food was average, did not come at the same time. Rice was normal, not mediterranean or arabic kind. A little bit too expensive for that.
4
There are many restaurants on this street but happy we chose this one.
The food tasted fresh and very tasty. Good sized portions.
The decor is simple but with a Turkish feel and the atmosphere was nice.

Went here for second time now and this time (second day of cny) the experience was frankly not worth the money. The food was served nearly cold (weird for dishes from the BBQ) and all side dishes like rice and veggies were fully cold. The service was slow and uncoordinated.Just the taste of the food in general was ok but nothing special...Seems dishes are pre-cooked and re-heated in microwave...I am used to turkish food from my origin which is very different from those offered here... Considering the location in Kampong Glam you should look for other restaurants as this seems to be a tourist tra
4
Normal touting by staff for business which is so Turkish but very friendly. Really fancied a pide and asked for the lamb pide with an egg on top. They didn't disappoint and it was lovely to while away an afternoon for lunch. Turkish coffee rounded out the meal.Well worth stopping by on your visit in the Kampong Glam area
3
As they say, location is everything. Here that is very true. There's outside dining along a pedestrian laneway with a beautiful mosque at the end. As the sun set and all the Turkish inspired lanterns came on with the mosque calling to its faithful it was magical. The tables are inlaid with tiles that have missing grout and are uneven, not great for balancing drinks on. The two person benches are snug. No suitable for wheelchairs, kids pushers were packed away by parents. No a great option if you have mobility issues. Service was prompt. The meal we ordered for the child came out with the entree which was appreciated. Although no specific kids menu. Great alternative to the usual options for dinner. But it was the sunset, the mosque, the great weather and the other shops that made it so enjoyable.
1
This was possibly the worst kebab place i've eaten at ever. Super dry and flavorless kafta. Even the starter platter of hummus, mutabal, etc was below par. The mixed grill platter was left almost untouched. The only good thing was the fresh bread. Everything else was horrible. Really bad experience.
4
Very solid choice, dependable kababs, good mezze and salads. We like to eat outside. Service is friendly and competent.
4
The decor and the mosaic tables were gorgeous. We ordered mixed grill with salads and dips. Heaps of fresh cooked food. Dips were amazing and there was more than enough variety and quatity for 2 of us. Excellent service
4
Arab Street is much more touristy than I had expected, all the restaurants seemed to be aimed at tourists rather than locals. But we decided to eat at Derwish anyway. We weren't disappointed. The service was quick and friendly, the decor lovely and the food was yummy! We chose some sort of flaming dish that was impressive and full of flavour. I'd definitely go back

We were visiting some friends in Singapore and were taken to Arab street area.After a wander around soaking up the atmosphere we decided to get some food. There were many restaurants to choose fro but we were very pleased that we chose Derwish.The food came in large portions and was delicious. We ordered some sharing starters and actually never did get on to main courses as the starters were huge and really filled us up!We found the price very reasonable by Singapore standards, however it was the location that made this stand out to us. We were overlooked by the stunning Mosque and sitting outside we were able to soak up the atmosphere. Tips: Sit outside if you can, watching the world go by as you're eating and looking at the Mosque is very relaxing and throws you right into the heart of Singaporean culture.If you want mains, don't order very many starters - they are huge! Delicious, but huge! :)We will return again next time we are in this area as the food was great and the service was friendly and attentive
1
Moussaka potato - no egg plant - poor quality minced lamb, all flavourless! No substance, minute ingredients floating in gravy & a little cheese plus a quarter of tomato. Fresh salad with a tiny bit of feta & 4 black olives. That was just mine. Falafel near burnt & flat - no taste. Husbands egg plant with flavourless lamb cold in the middle - S$76 with 2 bottles water + 10% service charge. Absolute rip off! Tourist walk on by. What the bald man promises is not on offer!
5
Had an excellent meal here. The food is fresh and tasty and despite its location, not overly changed to suit tourists' tastes. Choice of indoor or outdoor seating. Service is attentive without being annoying. Being in the fashionable eating area it is, however, it is a bit expensive
3
Situated right in Bussorah Street, a local tourist attraction, we were spoilt for choice with so many restaurants and cafes around. We chose Derwish because of its extensive menu and its pretty furniture. The service staff was helping and thorough in explaining the different kinds of Turkish cuisine in the menu. However, the food took quite some time to arrive. The Lavash Bread and the Hummus were great, but the Beyti Kebab that we ordered, was either kept out for too long, or not properly cooked. Being our first time trying Turkish cuisine, the food was disappointing as I thought better of it
5
Perfect Turkish cuisine right in the heart of Singapore. You will be spoilt for choice in this magical quarter of Singapore but do yourself a favour and head to 60 Bussorah Street. The salad is fresh, the lavash is warm and the meat is to die for. Make sure you try their lemonade too
3
Went here on a Saturday night, the vibe is nice and you can sit outside. The food is so so, it's good but not amazing ! We ordered way too much and got to taste a bit of everything . The kebab weren't too bad but the prices are really expensive for the qualir
2
Came here with my fiance. Ordered the mezze platter which is usually a sure bet. 4 out of the 6 items were soaked in mayo and looked like they'd been sitting in big industrial tubs for a couple years. Not fresh. We didn't touch those items and asked nicely if we could get some more hummus. The waiter said "1 more order of hummus? Sure!" and tried to charge us. We asked for it as a replacement. He said "no." So it just sat there, uneaten. At the end of the meal, we sent 80% of it back to the kitchen, then asked for it to be removed from the bill. The manager refused. It was pretty awful food, and an awful customer experience to top it off. A definite tourist trap, we should have known better
3
Good restaurant with a delightful Turkish menu. However, the space is very congested. It is divided into two sections, inside with air conditioning and outside. If you are non-smoker, I would suggest to dine inside. Because they serve shesha outside only.
5
This restaurant offers a great ambiance outside and inside of the restaurant with fabulous variety of Turkish delicacies.
3
Went here on a local recommendation.
Disappointed at the length of service. Very slow and disjointed.
The food was tasty except for the Lamb rack which the chef had destroyed.
Will be looking for another place next time.

During our monthly visit to Mustafa Centre for shopping, we take the opportunity to explore different types of cuisine. This time we decided to try some restaurant in Arab street. I am not sure if the person was owner or not, but there was a guy inviting people to taste the Turkish cuisine. We thought of trying. We sat inside the AC room as the temperature was hot outside. On a Saturday afternoon, the place was not crowded. We had very few options in vegetarian with hardly about 5-6 items to choose and most of them were like appetiser. Nothing much in main course. We chose the platter which comes with Lavash bread. We also ordered the spring rolls. We were disappointed with the spring rolls. They were very small in size with hardly any stuffing inside. The platter was a good mix of homous, salads, sauces etc. the Lavash bread was very fresh and tasted nice. We also tried some dessert which was a platter with 5 pieces of 2 different sweets. It was decent. I also tried the iced mint tea and didn't like it so much. I have eaten in other restaurants in the past around Arab Street. Most of them serve good quantity of food. I thought the quantity here was slightly smaller. For a similar price I can get a better deal at the nearby restaurant which serves Lebanese food named 'Beirut'. I liked the Lavash bread & the dessert but for overall food quality I would prefer to visit other places around Arab Street.
5
Derwish is located at Arab street. I have eaten here three times and each experience is very consistent. i come here to enjoy their Kebab. They are very delicious. You have to try it if you are visiting this restaurant. The service is alright. They are friendly and adequate. The restaurant has outside setting, so you can enjoy a nice day out. Treat yourself a taste of Kebab
4
Honestly the food was amazing but the whole experience not that greatWe started with the hummus (excellent) and the meze platter (so so...) and then ordered 3 dishes of meat. Unfortunately we had to wait for the meat for more than one hour, even by asking the staff a few times if they hadn't forgotten us... and the place was not even crowded. At the end we asked for a discount but the manager didn't want to, so he offered us a very small desert instead... Not sure I would go back there..
3
This is the only place we could find that serves sheesha (also called hookah) in Arab Street. It offers decent food but I would say one must try the middle-eastern desserts and the the variety of tea they offer. The best part is that it is open till late night unlike most of the Singapore
1
Browsing along the street we were attracted by the brightly tiled tables, the smartly dressed staff and large number of customers. There's no alcohol due to it being within 100m of the mosque but that's fine.The portion sizes were inadequate - they are probably the size you should eat but you expect a bit more in a restaurant especially at the prices being charged.However it's the service that deserves special criticism. Without a doubt it's the worst I have experienced in Singapore and as far as I can recall I think the worst I've seen in the world as the dishes come out completely at random. My daughter ordered falafel and fries. The falafel came out with the starters and the fries came out much later - I would have said with the main course but the staff didn't seem to understand that concept. The main course dishes were delivered at random intervals over the next hour. All except the pizza, which although I continually asked for it, showed no signs of arriving. At one point I told the waiter this was unacceptable and terrible. I threatened to stand with him as he lured customers off the street to warn them of what to expect. When it did arrive the pizza was just some dough with a little tomato purÃ©e that would have been put together in 5 mins.I didn't bother trying to get another drink as the place doesn't deserve the income.I think the root of the problem is that the touts outside pull in more customers than the kitchen can cope with.I don't expect bad reviews will have any affect as the restaurant gets more than enough trade from passers by.Although I got an apology there was no discount
4
We tried Derwish as we liked some Kebap. We had starters with humus, fresh bread, mixed salad and some lamb dishes as main course. The food was very good but the portion size compared with the prices was not ok. We are willing to pay more for a nice dinner but we expect not leaving hungry then. The service was so slow and I had to ask twice for service before beeing able to place an additional order. My food came 20 minutes later than my partners so I watched her eating and then she watched me eating afterwards.I was curious why people got served same dish even I ordered 10 minutes before them.Good food but adjust either portion sizes or prices and advise your service please
4
I would definitely give this place five stars because i tried the falafel and I thought it to be some of the best I've ever experienced, but prices were a bit steep. The owner and servers were all extremely friendly and the place was quite cute for lunch or coffee
5
Excellent food, shisha, lovely atmosphere. Very friendly staff with quick and prompt service. will definitely come back soon.
3
We just ordered salads and apps and they were good. The service was mediocre. The location is nice via the mosque though. You can hear the mosques call to prayer which is beautiful from this location.
4
We had the hummus and bread for starters. Hummus a bit bland iv had better from asda. Only a few small pieces of bread to go with it.The mango smoothie was absolutely delicious the best iv ever had!!!!!!We had donner sandwichs with fries. The sanwiches were nice. The fries portion was laughable only four fries per person!!!! We didnt order dessert
4
We went to the Arab Street area of Singaspore looking for a good Middle Eastern meal and what a lot there was on offer. Bussrah St itself gives more than ample choice but we decided to try Derwish on the strength of the menu and we were not disappointed. It was very popular and although we were there early and got a table with no difficulty the place filled up very rapidly. The service was excellent and the staff were very helpful in explaining some of the more unfamiliar dishes. There is plenty of choice and the servings are quite generous and fillingWe would go back
2
Located on the street opposite the Sultan mosque. Apart from the great big menus the experience is downhill after that. The bread was served cold, the vegetable mousaka contained one vegetable,tomatoes. The Islim kebab was packed with mince meat when the menu read lamb. All served with boiled rice? Boiled rice? 1st time ever for a turkish restaurant. Ordered fries that never came. Paid 80sgd (around £40). Total waste.
1
...teh overall experience is very poor. Bad service despite there dare so many waiters. they don´t know the basics, we had to ask for the menu, when we ordered water , they brought one for 4 people. Waited very long for the food which was nothing special.there are better places in this lovely quarter of Singapor
4
I have eaten here several times for afternoon snacks or a light dinner. Never really eaten that much Turkish food before but I like the food here. The location is in the main shopping street to the mosque, it's fascinating in the day but really comes alive at night. The staff have always been very polite and efficient getting our orders correct. Some of my friends are regulars here and they have been for evening meals, but know exactly what to ask for. Overall, I really like this restaurant and would recommend anyone to go to have an introduction to Turkish food. The menu is very detailed with photos and descriptions of exactly what is in each dish, which is great. For 3 delicious dishes and 2 drinks we paid $30, what a bargain

Right where do i start, first off we was touted off the street to come & eat something nice by this bold headed bouncer looking waiter type person, it just so happend we was looking for somewhere to have dinner & was quite hungry.(the alarm bells should have rung straight away when we was greeted by this guy) if this establishment was any good they shouldn't be on the street punting out for business, anywaythe Messe selection we ordered for starters was as bland as my grandmother on a night out with the boys, also the main we ordered was a selection of meat kebabs which was pretty much flavourless (I've had much better from our local kebab shop)the service was almost non existent once we was seated
2
We chose this place because it looked great, nice decor and set in a lovely street with real character. We were greeted by the staff and made to feel welcome, and we were helped with our menu choices, so far so good.We shared a plate of mese initially; this was dumped on our table with no side plate, cutlery or napkins for us to use. I asked for some napkins, as I initially thought we were going local, using our fingers, but I watched other tables and they were given plates, cutlery and napkins with the same starter as us. It seems that once we had our meal we were invisible. Again by recommendation we shared a main course; a selection of meat kebabs including chicken and beef, most of which was tasteless and the beef was tough. It was served with rice and vegetables (pre-frozen) and salad. This time I asked for plates, cutlery and napkins as again they were not forthcoming. Very disappointed, such a shame.The staff seems to spend so much time coaxing people into the restaurant from the street they forget their existing customers, so initial service is great, but once they have you sat with your starter, the service stops. The quality of the food is not even equal to our local takeaway kebab shop

We came here for dinner and at the time there were very few people in the restaurant, therefore we were offered our own pick of tables. However, within 10 minutes the place was starting to fill, so we had to move to another table. This place does not serve alcohol, so we ordered an apple tea and a coke. For starters we had a couple of mezze dishes with homemade garlic bread. Not bad - but a bit bland, however with the bread it livened it up a bit. For mains we ordered the Lamb Kebab & the Chicken kebab of which both were served with rice and salad. The lamb kebab came out and by the time my chicken one came out my hubbie had eaten his meal. Both meals were disappointing in flavour. I have eaten some great meals in Turkey, so these meals in my opinion were not representative of the food you get in that country. Our meals & 2 drinks came to $75.90 and I think there is better value for money out there

Loved the balcony, the hummus and the mint tea. Located in Bussorah Street, a busy but charming precinct near major hotels and Bugis tube station, we found this the perfect place for a lunch stop.
5
All the dishes especially ( musgkaa,iskander and kabab ) . If you come to Singapore you have to try it . Do not miss this resturent
2
An attractive place to eat in the bustling Arab street area, with a view of the mosque, but that's about it. The food is poor and didn't taste authentic. Much better in Singapore and in Arab street. Not recommended
4
We had a great brunch at Derwish, food was great and flavorful. The Turkish mint ice tea and the Kunefe are amazing. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service was friendly though not the fastest.
4
I was surprised by the relatively low ranking of this restaurant on Trip Advisor. A friend who lives in Singapore took us to the restaurant and we had a great early meal prior to going to the Night Safari. Great vegetarian and meat options. The breads are a highlight
4
This restaurant pretty much stands out on the street filled with other Turkish and middle eastern cafes. Nice decor, good service (although I was a bit put off by one of the waiters coaxing the passers by to come over to the restaurant. A restaurant of reputation doesn't need to do that). We sat on the inside as it was a hot sultry Singapore afternoon. The food was just about OK, average in taste and portions and quite pricey for the amount we were served. The hummus was served with regular bread instead of pita bread, something such a restaurant mustn't do. Mint tea in the pitcher was nice and refreshing. Adana kebab was great in taste but again a small portion for the price. Now, for the dessert..we ordered a portion of the Kunafa - a traditional dessert that required around 10 minutes to prepare. But I would've waited an hour for this one if I had to. It was DIVINE. Probably one on the best desserts I've had in my life. I don't know if the recipe was traditional or tweaked, but it tasted like a million bucks. The fried vermicelli cake dipped in a sugar syrup and the double cream "sauce" poured over was just irresistible even after a heavy meal. If you visit this place, I recommend you to just have this dessert, you can skip a lot of stuff from the main menu but not this
4
I only thought to google reviews of the restaurant only after ordering. I was getting bored waiting for our food to come - it took around 20 plus minutes. Though I saw a lot of bad reviews it was kinda too late for us to back out. Very fortunately it was much better than what I read about.We ordered hummus, 2 mains - sultani chicken and kofte, 2 desserts - kunefe and panna cota and 2 cups of tea - Turkish Apple and Strawberry tea (we were very hungry). The hummus arrived after the mains which was weird since it was supposed to be an appetizer. The mains were okay...the sauce made it taste a little better but I wished it had more taste or was spicier. The hummus and lavash bread were good and so were the desserts, especially the kunefe. The Apple tea also tasted better than the strawberry. All in all, it was a pretty good dining experience for us. The guy who promoted to us the restaurant kept checking if we needed anything else and if everything was good. It was in the end quite expensive but we did have a lot and were satisfied with what we had. We paid around $42 each for everything.The atmosphere and decor was also very nice inside the restaurant
4
I'm really surprised by the reviews here. I had an entirely different experience. We really enjoyed our food. It wasn't busy. It was Christmas night. I had the lamb chops while my husband had the snapper. My grilled lamb chops (delicious!) came with a very nice tomato sauce, vegetables and bread. We ordered the lavash and it was heavenly! Service could be better, but we weren't in a rush and was enjoying the A/C as anyone would in the Singaporean humidity. I had the iced tea which was already sweetened. Very good. All iin all, I would def come back here again

We should have known better, after being herded inside by a tout on the street, but the restaurant was very busy and the decor looked nice so we thought "this must be good"Well, we were wrong. We were given an inside table because the tables outside were full and handed one menu for 4 people. After a struggle to try and all see what we wanted a "waiter" gave us a second one and we decided on drinks. They would not give us water in glasses - we had to buy bottles. We also had 2 "homemade lemonades" which were ok but hawker stall lemon is better and a watery tasteless yoghurt drink. We asked for tomato juice but were told they didn't have it even though the menu boasted fresh juices and our subsequent dishes had tomatoes in them.When we ordered food we were told there would be a 15 minute wait as the kitchen was so busy but that was ok. The first course came, the mixed mezze which for $23 was a joke. One piece of Turkish bread for 4 people, 6 types of watery dips flat on a platter, no serving implement and small bread plates each off which to eat.The next course was mixed kebabs. It was served on a metal pan on top of an oil burner to keep it hot, but the burner was not lit and it just took up too much room on our table and made eating even more uncomfortable with the small plates not replaced from the dips. We then had a vegetarian moussaka which actually tasted nice but it was very small and certainly way too expensive for what it was but at least we were given a serving spoon and we asked for new plates.Overall the meal was a very unpleasant experience and while the staff tried, they had no idea how to provide service in a restaurant which charges prices you would expect in a 5 star hotel
1
Not a good experience - food was ok. Quite pricey for what is a average meal - $66 for the two of us with a main each and shared hummus. What made the experience not enjoyable was the service. They have 3 guys on the street trying to get people in and then the same helping people with the shisha (which is expensive) and no one to service the customers while they are in the restaurant. We wanted desert but after our plates sat on our table for 30 mins without any one clearing them and us being ignored we gave up and tried to get the bill again like pulling teeth but got there in the end. If the same effort and staff was used to service the customers who they already have in the restaurant compared to getting people in then it wouldn't be a half bad restaurant.
3
Food is good,i love the turkish bread and the dessert is delicious...shisha is good too...but they kinda bill us really expensive for the shisha....also they didnt give the shisha menu with the price.the kind of place you visit first time and will never comeback.
4
Don't expect too much when coming here. The Meezes were good, but that was it. Not extraordinarily good, not breath taking but good. Nice atmosphere, you can smoke Shisha if you want to. Average to low service though, don't expect too much!
2
I give two stars for the attempt to create Turkish ambiance in the restaurant (which is quite nice), the wonderful location @ Bussorah st. and the pleasant Turkish owner who took down our order.
As for the food, I've had better.
1
Came for dinner - everything was forty minutes to an hour with a couple of reminders before it reached our table - including water ! The quality of the food was terrible and the service worse ! Don't ever step into this place - waste of time money and energy !

wandering past this place on Friday night and stopped to have a look at the menu. A waiter came and went through some of the menu that was at the entrance and we decided to give it a try. We were seated and given menus. No attnetion for a good 10-15 mins then eventually someone took our order. We ordered starters and mains and as it is a Turkish Halal Muslim reasturant they only serve soft drinks, coffee or tea. No alcohol at all. Starters came which were pretty basic hummous and their traditional eggplant dip called babahganouch I think and beautiful lavosh bread. As we started eating we were given another dish which we didn't know what it was and asked 2 different waiters who shrugged their shoulders before eventually someone else said what it was. We didn't understand what he said and after asking 3 times We thought it was one of our mains but as it didn't look like what we'd ordered we asked again to be told it was ours. I had just finished phtting my knife in it to see what it was and taste the sauce when another waiter suddenly whipped it from us saying' not your dish' . We then Watched as he delivered it to another table as quick as he'd taken it from ours just putting it In front of the oblivious diners. Unbelievable ! Our mains were delivered separately which happens regularly in Singapore so weren't too concerned at this. Moussaka came fist served with bread on the side: it was barely warm but tasted ok and after having watched some of the other going ons we decided just to eat it rather than complain. Our mixed kebab dish served with rice was brought to us when we still had the starter plates and the mousska on the table. Given we had a table for 2 and not a lot of space we were struggling to find room to eat. When we finished the moussakka dish we asked for it to be removed which was done with a grunt: the kebab plate has a nice selection of beef, chicken and lamb on it with a cupful of rice in the centre. Again not very warm but edible and some nice flavors .The bill was $80 which for the amount of food and singaoire prices was pretty reasonable. If only they could get the food warmer and Improve the service especially having waiters being able to converse with customers, then This place could be a lot better.I don't write a lot of reviews although I travel on a regular basis. I do write if something is exceptional or if there is definite need for improvement which is certainly the case here
1
The food came out on time, but was chewy and seriously low/poor quality. Will certainly not be returning. We were hoping to have dessert also, but were put off by what was bought out for starters and main course. We had the mixed mezze and mixed grill, it would not surprise me if the food had been sitting out back for over a week. Atmosphere was good though and decent location
1
Let's start with the good : The dips and turkish bread are pretty good.Now the bad : The main courses are bland, and in the case of the codfish, it just wasn't fresh. And the service is among the worst I've encountered in Singapore (and that's a very low bar). A request for a glass of water took three repeats (and sending back a bottle); an order for a pot of tea had to be repeated three times, and then ended up as a cup of tea, which we sent back to a very confused look. Even though there weren't a lot of people inside, every order had to be repeated multiple times and was almost always confused. They seem to focus entirely on the sheesha smokers outside and their language/comprehension skills start and end with tobacco orders. You can do a lot better in the same street
1
It looked nice from the outside and tables were full so why not? Let me count the ways. We ordered the mixed mezze. I was expecting hummus, babaganoush, some falafel... We got various sorts of watery tasteless messes. Hummus was watery chick peas. I'm not sure what the rest was. One had some apple in it. The bread dried into a solid board in moments. Then onto the mixed grill. The beef was dry. The minced lamb was undercooked. We dare not touch the chicken. It wasn't the usual succulent flavored cubes I have come to expect. It was small pieces of second rate chicken on skewers. The whole lot was covered with a sauce (really?!?!!) and served with a sodden lump of over cooked boiled rice in the middle. We left most of it and made a swift exit.
1
A genuine mistake was made by the manager when taking our order, a dish was missed, we re ordered, he apologised, all was fine. It then took over 30 mins for the dish to arrive and when we asked for a discount for the inconvenience, it was denied. We asked to remove the discretional service charge and the manager refused to because it will come out of his pocket - as it should!!Unbelievable considering the effort restaurants usually go to to ensure you have a good experience and return custom. I wouldn't recommend it. The place next door is much better!!!
4
We have eaten here twice, it was so good the first time we took our friends with us the second time! The atmosphere is good and the owner is friendly. Both our visits were on the weekend so it was quite busy on the visits. The location is great and you can enjoy your food an people watch!I had the mixed kebab on both occasions, plenty of good tasty food. Wouldn't have any problem going back
1
we went to this place after visiting the mosque - the decor is really nice and it's just down the street.... But the food is horrible. You have to wait ages and then it doesn't look good and neither taste good. We also ordered a Turkish mint tea and get a teapot full of peppermint tea bags! As we complaint about this they just said that they don't have any mint leaves - no excuses, nothing. So my recommendation - even if the setting is nice, don't go there it's just a waste of time and money and you will not be happy when you go out
3
The location and decor was lovely- great view of the nearby mosque. However being so close to the mosque no alcohol is allowed. The mint tea was ok- a pity there was just one tiny mint leaf and a mint tea bag in my cup. I would have expected fresh mint. The prices are ok but quite frankly the food is not great. The mixed Mezze starter was ok- i've had much better. The fresh warm lavash bread was delicious. Our main courses weren't v warm, my chicken shish kebab was lukewarm and wasn't tasty. My boyfriend's 'father of all kebabs" was not hot either and tasted mediocre. The rice was stodgy. So we won't go back to eat. A nice place to have a non-alcoholic drink and use a shisha (if that's what you like) but that's all
1
Their food portion is really little.. We had to wait over an hour for our food.. Had to keep calling the waiter to ask if our food is ready, the wait is so long that ice in our drinks already melt, My shakshuka was really cold when I got it seems like they just took it from the fridge, I thought it was suppose to be serve when its hot? The baklava serving is so little for 8 dollars - 3 small cubes thats thats size of an ice cube. This is the worst restaurant I've ever been to in singapore. Never again. I don't recommend anyone do dine here
3
I spent a dinner here with a colleague of mine. The food arrived at very different time so I have finished as my colleague received its plate.Food was good, nothing extraordinary but the place is nice and calm in a delicious Arab block.Prices are aligned to Singapore, something less I guess.We smoked and spent a nice evenin

Kampong Glam is one less visit part of Singapore for me other than the occasional visit to the Padang rice stores at Kandahar street. One night we decided to try some middle eastern food and found ourselves wondering along Bussorah Street. It was a very pleasant surprise as the whole area is transformed into a very unique cultural attraction. For a moment, we felt like we were tourist in our own country. The whole area is filled with alfresco Turkish, Moroccan and even a Beirut restaurant. We selected Derwish Turkish restaurant because it has one of the most scenic spot. With the majestic Sultan mosque as the backdrop complemented with the surrounding buzz, it was exceedingly pleasant. Food at Dervish was alright. The menu is dominated with kebab dishes in chicken, beef, seafood and lamb done in quite a few ways. Service was a little disorganized. I am giving it a 4 star rating because very lively and pleasant ambient. Overall, it was very fun and enjoyable evening
2
Ate there last night and was disappointed. The moussaka was the worse I've ever eaten - a stew with pre-fried potatoes in a runny sauce.Moussaka is my favourite Turkish dish and when it's well made, can be heavenly. In this case, it was terrible and I only ate it out of hunger and the cost of $22We have a feta salad that was so-so, I would've done better at home without trying.All in all , not recommended. Nothing special and not going back
2
- Athmosphere is very good-Food is very very average- Service is quite slow- Dinners are served on different times.. Difference in serving the first and last dish was15 minutes so my girlfriend was already finished when my friend was still waiting for his plate- it took 15 minutes before the bill came ( need to ask twice for it)- the bill was full of errors, also 2nd bill was incorrect again ( although the 2nd bill amount was too low)- the highlight of the evening was an icecream at7-eleven at the other side.- all in all quite a disapppointmen
4
went here for dinner with my couple friend and their baby. the supervisor was very accommodating. he seated us outside which is great at that time, not too hot and the street view is nice. i couldn't help feeling good with the berry scent of the group smoking hookah at the other table. we ordered mixed kebab, really chili beef dish (i forgot the name) and some pita bread and hummus. the serving sizes are good for sharing so we split the bill and were surprised how cheap it became. it is cheap for the kind of food we ate the the great dining experience. the food is really great and very tasty. the kebabs were not dry unlike other similar restaurants. i also liked the table design and the utensils they used. ill definitely come back to this place
1
We went to this restaurant to have a late dinner in a thursday night and it was a big deception. My girlfriend ordered the salmon and me the lamb kebab and after wait for more than 30min the waiter delivery the dish with almost 10 minutes interval. My lamb was good but I wanted with bread and they give me with rice... the salmon was not cook, I think just defrosted like the small vegetable... The tea was good, the only good point because when I requested for the bill they delivery after 10 more minutes and with mistake because they charged me a side dish I never received. .. Finally after 5 more minutes I went inside to pay but they have only one pen for the whole restaurant... hahaha good joke!!I will never come back because I really like turkish ambiance and this place kill the turkish reputation of service!!
4
I had the most amazing lunch here, a platter of assorted dips, dolmades, olives and the best and biggest Turkish flat bread I've yet come across. For me, the only downside was people at the next table smoking a hookah pipe - I was seared outside, but don't enjoy second hand smoke while eating
1
Don't be fooled by this place the food is horrible and not Turkish at all. We ordered Hummus and it was the kind that you buy in the supermarket and it came with italian bread.
4
Our first night in Sinpapore and we headed out to dinner we walked for a short while before being asked "Turkish for dinner" we thought why not it has been a while!The atmosphere was busy but sitting on the street you could watch the goers by.The food was amazing! We ate a basic Turkish meal and it was delicious!
4
My husband and i recently visited Derwish for maybe the 20th time because I don't think any place could serve better Babaganoush than here. The food is scrumptious and the ambiance just so lovely! We prefer to be seated outside in the open, amidst the hustle bustle of Bussorah St. with the beautiful grand mosque in the backdrop. Coming back to the food; I think one must definitely try their mint tea, lavash bread with haydari or cacik, taboule and baba ganoush. I just wish the portions were bigger though. But, in all, a great place to spend an evening gorging on some fine turkish delicacies
4
Many reviewers here banging on about 'authenticity' although personally I am far more concerned with the taste of the food than the accuracy of its provenance and we certainly weren't disappointed here.Situated in Bussorah Street, behind the famous Arab Street, the restaurant sits amidst attractive terraces of colonial shophouses, at the end of the pedestrian street is a stunningly beautiful mosque and sitting here people watching whilst eating some excellent food was a delightful way to spend ninety minutes.The restaurant was very busy, people queuing for a table and yet the service was generally brisk and always attentive and charming. For the record the three of us ate:Meze Tabagi, Coban Salata, Tavuk Shish, Beyti, Kuzu Shish, with 1 Lavash, 1 Fresh Orange juice and 1 Iced Mocha. More than satisfying and the bill amounted to 125.40 SD including service. Good ambience and top food
4
Lamb kebab was excellent! Prominent spicy flavours and tender meat done just right. Visited with friends who have also experienced the Middle East and they agree- this was a heck of a good kebab! DÃ©cor was typical Turkish, vibrant burst of geometric designs and colours. Interesting way to get upstairs, going right past the kitchen and up an old rickety set of steep stairs. Service, good, they did make a real effort to find us seating on a really crowded night. Must visit again. Ambience, er...not first-date material, but lots of fun if you're with a bunch of friends
4
Had dinner here one evening. It was an interesting experience.we ordered a mezza plate to share for entree which arrived in record time. In fact probably the fastest service I have ever had. The mezza plate was tasty and huge - probably enough for a meal. The main courses arrived whilst we were still working our way through the Mezza plate so our small table was laden with food. we had to stop eating the Mezza to commence on the mains before they went cold. I have chicken stuffed with sultanas and chees which was lovley and my friend had mousaka which she found good. The portions were too big for us but probably fine if you are a big eater.The meal was fine but we would have liked to linger over the food and we felt rushed and were out of the resteraunt within 45 minutes. Well priced for Singapor
5
After strolling through Arab street, shopping and looking at the interesting homes inthe area we stopped for lunch at Derwish Turkish restaurant. The appetizer was great, a combination of all appetizers in one plate. The lamb was excellent, juicy, and spiced just right. My wife had the salmon, she did not care for it because it was over cooked, I usually cook salmon at home differently. Stick to Turkish or Mediterrenean dishes. Great meal and service. Eat outside and watched life going by.
4
Talking a walk around Arab Street we could not stop ourselves from indulging in some Turkish food. We selected Derwish as the location looked good and the menu too. We ordered humus for starters followed by adana tavuk kebab and iskender. It was indeed great food and mutton was so nicely cooked and so was the chicken. To complete the dinner we ordered Firin and it was indeed delightful. Just perfect dinner what I would call and we will be back soon
4
The Arab Street with its offtakes, in the rear of the Sultan mosque is hugely popular place especially on a Saturday night with nearly each restaurant having a waiting line.Frankly, we chose this place purely by the fact that there was a waiting line, reasoning that it must be a popular eating house. And let me tell you, we were not disappointed.At the time of writing this review, I have read some other reviews which have expressed their disappointment. Well, to each his own, depending upon his expectations and taste buds.In our case, our only expectation was to taste some turkish food, which we had enjoyed last in Istanbul. Without looking at the pasta and pizza section. we ordered a lamb and a chicken kabab alongwith the naan (they call it lavaash bread), other than other mixed platter dishes which were served with rice. We liked the kababs so much that we ordered a repeat. As someone has somewhere else said, the lavaash bread was a "huge puff of happiness". We entirely concur.I do not agree with a reviewer who wrote about chunks of meat mounted on to a skewer. The kababs which we ordered were definitely cooked on the knife type of skewer (and not the rod type, as commonly found in India) as it was quite a struggle to plate it from the skewer. Well cooked too with just the right amount of spices. The taste was awesome, especially that of the lamb kabab.The surprising thing about the whole experience was that despite the restaurant being overflowing, yet they managed to serve us real fast. Our first order came within 10 to 12 minutes and subsequently the entire order for 6 adults and 3 children was completed within 30-35 minutes (and that included a repeat order). I must add that though we were sitting in the verandah outside the restaurant, yet the entire decor inside had good mosaic tiling on walls in the east Mediterranean style with huge motifs and colorful borders. The crockery and the coasters too was of the same design which contributed to the ambiance with people enjoying their hookah while savoring the delights
2
After seeing many reviews and asking from freinds we went to this resturant, their was nothing fancily turkish or mediterranean , they has pasta and pizza too. After making the order we were highly disspointed, the food was blant , no flavoir at all. I guess nandos and kfc has better flavour. Total let down, not worth the money spent
2
Much better places for food. Tabouli had too much onion and almost no parsley. Turkish for westerners!
There are better options but good if you want safe easy 'Arab Street' fud.
4
Go here for great standard grilled food and good service. Been here many times now. Some people may be drawn to the Istanbul Grill and Bar close by as they serve alcohol. However the Istanbul Bar is terrible so would recommend Derwish anytime.
5
Off of Arab street! with all the other food places. It is the most crowded and we know why. The food is great. We all voted after our 10 day stay in Asia and this place was our favorite
2
As an Australian Turk i always like to try turkish food where ever i go in asia. This restaurant to me is %50 turkish and %50 fake. They could certainly do better if they try. the thing really upset me was the shish kebab they claimed was not even cooked on the skwwer but it was peieces of meat taken from a pot dish and mounted on the skewer to make it look like shish kebab. To me this is really a bad practice and disrespectful to the clients. The pide was passable and the mixed dips quiet good. The price was extremely expensive for what it is costing us $120 for 4 with only soft drinks

I have heard about Arab Street from one of my seniors, but got the chance to visit the place today. It’s about 15 minutes walk from Bugis MRT. The ambience of this area is somewhat different from the usual mall culture, which will make you feel glad in a sense that you get the taste of Middle East Asia here in Singapore.I walked down the lanes with people smoking ‘hookah’ in the several restaurants lined by the street. Location of the mosque in Arab Street is the juncture that sets the ambience for the Arabian culture. And palm trees lined by the streets (I guess they were palm, maybe wrong) adds to the flavor.Hungry as I was, I took a seat at one of the several restaurants – Derwish, a Turkish Mediterranean Restaurant, as the name goes. And I am a happy man.The food is ‘just too nice’. For starters I ordered Chicken Nuggets with Cheese sticks. And for the main course there was Adana Tavuk Kebab, Babagannus and Lavash. I asked the waiter to bring in the starters first. Maybe the starters took longer time than the main dishes, so he brought the food in reverse order, bringing the kebab first.I am glad he did so. This dish is served with rice / bread, with sauce and a kebab stick with the smoke of grilled chicken which you can enjoy as you eat. The more you eat, the more you enjoy the preparation. Served with a little sauce and broccoli, this dish is perfect treat for food lovers.After that came the Chicken nuggets and cheese sticks. A perfect blend of spice and spirit. Munching the chicken and listening to the music that came through, I couldn’t ask for more.The best part of the food was in the ambience. I could see the top of the mosque from where I was sitting and hear the chant that came through. With people filling up the side tables and passing by, it was more like a movie scene with the backdrop of Arabia.Lavash is a bread, which I mistook for the usual Indian ‘Nan’, though it looks and tastes pretty the same. And I am pretty not sure what how or what Babagannus is, not even after eating. But one thing I am pretty sure is, it is good. This is a vegetarian item; I got so impressed by the name that I ordered it. All I could say is that it is white in color, kind of gravy type, not spicy and can be eaten with bread. Kindly note: Beer is not served in this restaurant. I hope they did.But the food is ‘Just Too Nice’. Planning to come back to try out…. something else.The address for the restaurant goes as:Derwish Turkish Restaurant60 Bussorah Street, Singapore - 19947

The restaurant is nice location in Arab street. Alas, food was not that good. We've ordered Kabab platter and some of chicken pieces were literally uncooked. We've informed staff about this and they took it back. Instead of replacing it, they have brought same piece in burnt condition. Bad experience
5
The best Turkish food in Singapore. On average i will be here twice per month with my family:) we love the kofte best! Hummus and lamb pide pizza. They serve the best mango juice too! Iskander and mixed kebab are must have ! They serve best pizza and best bread too. The starter hummus will keep you going and waiting for more! Bon appetit. Hmmm i am looking forward to my next visit alread

Having tried Deli Moroccan which is opposite Derwish on the previous night, we opted for Derwish on the strength of its beautiful Turkish appearance - the decor is really lovely - and the exhortations of the clearly authentic chap who was spruiking it on the street.We sat outside on a typical balmy Singapore night and tucked into a kebab dish and a lamb dish, and a traditional mediterranean salad. The lamb dish and the salad were very good, the kebab was okay but not stellar. The traditional lemonade was a perfect compliment to the food.Worth a visit but if you're looking for the best Turkish food in the world this probably is not it
2
On a recent hot afternoon, myself and numerous other tourists stumbled into this friendly establishment. Their lemonade (American style, not Sprite) was excellent and refreshing. We all ate entrées but none were particularly great. I had the lamb kebabs which were a little overdone and basted in a somewhat bland sauce. Given its wonderful location, this restaurant doesn't need to try too hard, but it should, because it could be great. I will say that I don't eat a lot of Turkish food, but I've had much Greek and Lebanese food to compare this to
2
Went to Derwish last night, my interest piqued by having been by it numerous times during the day. Its on the pedestrian mall of Bussorah Street leading up to the Golden Sultan Mosque. So yes - it is a pretty nice location and quite buzzy on any evening. Staff who 'tout' the restaurant are friendly enough and only too eager to get you set up at a table. We ordered two types of kebabs to try. The 'father' of all kebabs as described on the menu - took a while and arrived only warm, not hot as one would expect with a small amount of rice and veg. The second order only arrived waaay after we had finished this first dish. I found both dishes spectacularly mediocre at best. We've been to Turkey before and sad to say what we had just didn't even come close. Its in the alcohol free zone so you can't even drown your disappointment in a beer. The cold Turkish tea didn't really do the trick. If you don't really care about the food and just want to sit and have a cold drink and people watch, then yeah go for it. Otherwise I think its overpriced for what it is
