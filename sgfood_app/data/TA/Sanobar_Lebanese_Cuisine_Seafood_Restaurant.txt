Had lunch/early dinner with family. Food was good, service so-so. They forgot one of the orders. A bit pricy, but all in all good food.

There are a lot of choices of restaurants in this area of town but we found this place to be really good. We had the tabouli with hummus, and naan bread.

I came here for lunch last week with a friend and opted for some hummus and a kebab. The food was quite good and was served efficiently. We were about the only people there at lunchtime on a weekday though.

I ordered max grill and the food was really delicious , the portions was too much for one person ,alo the orange juce was pure and fresh.
This restaurant has the best combination between price , food quality, portion and service in arab street .

Labneh, hummus, fatoush and falafel were fantastic. Super-thin bread toasted pita bread is awesome. Definitely recommend.

Definitely, the best lebanon food I have tried by now. Hummus is very delicious and the main meal is flavor melding. I would definitely recommend to everyone.

We went as a couple on a Sunday evening in November. There are several similar restaurants on the same street and we chose this without much consideration. While the food was reasonably standard the service was poor and at times unpleasant/unprofessional. The waiter provided very slow service and seemed to spend much of the time either smoking on the street or talking to a man on another table who seemed to be a friend. When didn't have the exact change for the bill and so overpaid (including the hefty service change) and waited for our (small) change. After a waiting for a while and trying to flag him he shouted and laughed that we would wait for such a small amount. While it was a small amount, we felt that returning it was standard and shouldn't need to be argued about. This was an example of the service throughout the evening. In retrospect, I regret paying to service change and should have paid less and endured the shouting

Me and my father ordered hummas and max grill platter for 2.Positives: the chicken and beef grills were superlative. Rice was good too. The quantity was more than enough. We could not finish. The lambs were okay. Very juicy were the grills. Negetive: they did not inform that max grill platter also has hummas with it so the hummas we ordered as appetizer was not actually required. Good waiters always tell these things. They only thought more orders more business.Overall the food and experience was pretty good. Forgot to take picture of max grill platte

Restaurant serving Middle East food. They do have good business as they are serving good food. They offer grilled meat and seafood. Most of the time I get mix grill. They are generous with the serving and most probably you need help to finish your plate

Overall experience was good specially the guy (Ali & Abdullah) who served and insisted us to come at Sandbar made our visit worthwhile.
Food was fine and fresh.
Tho it's on the expensive side.
Sitting area very cramped and its difficult to move over.
4
Simple, straightforward honest fresh food.
No pomp or ceremony.
Would happily eat here again.
Good choice of vegetarian starters and fresh fruit juice. The bread was freshly baked.

Looked like a nice place alfresco infront of the Sultan's mosque. The host was friendly and food on the picture menu looked good so we decided to sit at Sanobar above all the other many restaurants on Bussorah Street. We ordered the Special hummus, Halloumi cheese, and grilled chicken with rice. Every dish was sadly disappointing and we felt completely ripped off. The Special hummus was supposed to come with pine nuts, walnuts and fresh parsley (it costs $5 more than normal hummus) but when it arrived, there were a few walnuts and no pine nuts nor any sign of parsley. The hummus itself was actually quite nice but it was not what we ordered! The Halloumi was shocking - a few slapped on pieces of cheese (see picture) and the rice was dry and felt it was re-heated. When we brought these to the attention of the Manager (we had to show him the menu and point out that the hummus they advertised had pine nuts and parsley), he told us that the Owner/Chef was off today and so it is a mess (?!). When we asked if the Halloumi served was actually the same as in the picture shown, he said, yes, its the same dish. (See picture attached - seriously?).... ... There are so many other restaurants on this street - looks like we'll be trying them

The boss welcomed us to the restaurant out of the blue and gave us drinks on house. All the food were fresh from the menu and its authentic. Their sauce and cheese rolls are really magical. Do visit this place and for Muslims- this place is right in front of masjid in Arab st thus it will be great view to dine in. Only negative i felt is the seat as it was quite uncomfortable. But the food is worth way more than the price

Wanted something different. Not the first time trying Lebanese cuisine but frankly, I can't tell if its authentic.My rating:Food: GoodService: GoodPrice: 3 dishes (very filling-S$68)Ambiance: AverageI would recommend outdoor sitting as its quite cramped inside. Service was good. One point to note: Its quite difficult to understand the menu (food description against pictures) so be prepared to spend more time to decide what you want to eat. The staff, probably not well versed in English, were unable to recommend dishes to us (I'm OK with that as I cannot expect everyone to speak a common language fluently thus it won't be fair for me to rate negative for this). Overall experience was good (there is no Good rating on this website so I rated average)

Visited this place with family for Hari Raya lunch while exploring Arab Street. The manager standing outside is quite welcoming and literally pulled us into the restaurant, however the hospitality largely ends once you are in. The place is quite cramped (especially if you are sitting indoors), service time is quite long and food is not fresh. I am sure the Barbeque we got was cooked well in advance -- not sure why it takes so long to serve. The only saving grace was the Hummus (which my kids liked) and somewhat Shish Tawook. We also ordered Lamb Shish, Arice (arabic version of turkish lamacun) and Kunafa (took almost 20 mins to be served!)Based on quality/quantity of food, I will definitely rate this as overpriced

They serve authentic lebenese food which is fresh and tasty. Though pricey but food overall is worth eating if you looking for arab food in Singapore. The place doesn't have great ambience, space is limited and on roadside but great food and that makes you happy

The owner/manager will be so convincing that anybody would fall for it. I was assured lamb imported from Australia which was slow cooked for a dish named ' Lamb Mandi'. The lamb was simply over cooked, tasteless, and rice along with the dish were just covered with food colour( because it didn't taste of saffron at all). Moreover, the veg falafel we ordered didn't have a falafel in it. They instead served a wrap with cabbage and french fries. Highly unprofessional, hopeless food and ridiculous service
2
Pricey, indifferent food lacking in flavour. A great tourist trap. Surprised that in Singapore
of all places such insipid food was offered.
5
Great food and people. Chatted for hours. No alcohol because of the proximity to the mosque, but no problem at all. Delicious food and very nice atmosphere.

Had a nice dinner - very authentic dishes and the starters 1001 platter is great. The shish Kebab was excellent and the Mint Lemonade was amazing.
Our young waiter even though not from Lebanon (all others are) was very friendly and had the Arabic hospitality.

A great place for a meal, the food was excellent well presented and delicious. However the service and the facilities need to be improved. However great vibe to sit outside and watch the tourists wander past.

We had dinner at Sanobar and ordered hummus, baba ganoush, tabouleh and chicken kofta. The vegetables were fresh and full of taste, very nice. The chicken was good but we had better visiting the Middle East. Unfortunately we had a very strange ending to our visit. When we were paying the bill, the owner started a fight with someone on the street. Other guests on the terrace left immediately as well. Very sorry to see that.

If you're at Arab street, the Mecca for mid eastern food, this place should be the very last of your choices!!Not only is the food not authentic, even the taste is lousy! We had a hummus and something like a baba ganoush, both were barely average. The kebabs entree left much to be desired... Not juicy, they were chewy and tasted bad. The sauces accompanying the dishes were ludicrous, not Lebanese at all. They've tried to get ambience, but sadly it's a mish mash of various things thrown together, wierdo lights in a corner...and talk about an authentic Mid East restaurant that plays Bollywood songs?!!! They couldn't change it to mid eastern even upon request!!Being in Arab street area, if they can't do mid eastern, they would be better off catering a different cuisine perhaps!Only saving grace, prices were reasonable... But even that would not draw me back to this restaurant a second time

We ordered fatoush, mixed grill and fried haloumi, their taste were authentic. Being living and going around in Middle East for many years, I am familiar with Lebanese food and the quality of it. I can't really complain on anything. Most people here think the price is on the high side, and I found similar food is cheaper in Dubai (while in general food in Singapore is cheaper than in Dubai).Location is great, just along Bussorah street heading to the historic Sultan Mosque. The owner, a Lebanese of course, is very friendly as well as his staffs
5
We stopped in on a whim, but ended up staying for two hours. The food was fantastic - my husband and I love Lebanese food and this was the best we've had. The portions were very generous and just delicious. The owner/chef and all the staff were incredibly attentive, kind and friendly. Wonderful find!

It was our last night in Singapore and we were passing by this place when decided to have dinner. The owner/manager was desperate calling for new customers, seemed very friendly. We decided to stay and asked for two meals and juice. The drink never arrived and the food was terrible. All tables around us were full of customers complaining. It took more than 10 minutes to receive a fork and more than 20 just to find the manager to complain about the food. He said he was going to fix the order and never came back. We had to go to the counter to pay the bill because nobody came to check if we had finish or how was the meal. All customers unsatisfied and the worst manager ever! Terrible customer service. Very bad food. Very disappointed

bussorah street is very touristy. you have the restaurant owners standing outside, calling the passerbys in. it is quite pressurizing, due to so many choices. we decided to try this place after looking at the menu. we took a table outside. the menu selection isn't too bad.. the photos look much nicer than the actual dishes. food wise, it was ok but prices are on the high side. service wise, the owners could do better I feel. there is always a first time for trying new places
