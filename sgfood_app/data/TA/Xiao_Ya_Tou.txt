Tasty creative local chinese dishes! Loved the kurobuta char siew and stir fried broccolini. Also ordered the flower clams which has a tad too much chinese wine but clams were pretty fresh.
4
The staffs are very friendly and responsive to request. I like how they are being very creative with their dishes! Do try out milo dinosaur cocktail if you have the chance to!
4
Unagi Benedicts was good, the rest of the items so so and portion smaller than I expected because the price is on the higher side. Different menu on weekday and weekend. Unagi Benedict only available during weekend brunch time.
4
Nostalgic!
The whole place brings you back to the 1950s/60s Singapore.
Definitely an interesting place to bring the little ones or tourists.
We had Abacus (Suan Pan Zi) and Olive Fried Rice. Both were decent.
3
I liked this idea of a modern, "zhng-ed" hokkien mee but the portion was really small, which was disappointing given its price.
5
Never thought I'd ever pay more than $10 for a plate of Hokkien Mee but I'm glad I did, cause it was the best HKM I've ever tasted!
5
I moved to Singapore 3 months ago and work in Duxton Hill where this restaurant is situated. I can honestly say that out of all the (many) places I have eaten, Xiao Ya Tou is hands down the best, tastiest, most creative and flavoursome food I have had yet in Singapore. Plus the owner is absolutely lovely. I recommend the wagyu beef bowl at lunch and the flower clams at dinner. All insanely good
5
I like how the decoration of the shop was so nostalgic and it is like a short getaway from the hustle and bustle of city life. The food was awesome, especially the XYT hokkien mee! Has a strong wok hei taste and super worth the calorie count.
5
Recommended by a friend, who is a culinary teacher, we went with high expectations.And they were met!The food is freshly prepared, tasteful and consistently prepared. Meaning, we have gone many times and it's been very good every time.The staff is very friendly and happy to accommodate any dietary requirements - where possible of course
4
Had a delightful dinner at Xiao Ya Tou on a Sat night. Service was excellent and the dishes were served promptly. The rendition of lu rou fan used braised beef instead of pork which was an interesting change, and the meat was well marinated and soft. We loved the otak otak rolls and ngoh hiang too.
4
love the whimsical decor and nicely designed menu/placemats. food was alright only, exotic but won't wanna visit again
4
Tried the unagi eggs benedict and the KL hokkien mee. The unagi benedict was nice and something different from normal but I didn't really like the hokkien mee. Overpriced hawker centre food.
5
Amazing food, ambience and service :) Food takes a while to be served as it is cooked on the spot so do expect waiting time (mains may not be served a the same time so it is a good idea to share while waiting)
4
Food was good and interesting especially if you have overseas friends who wants an interesting twist to local food. Service was very very slow though. Go only if you have time to spare for a long meal...
4
Two Singaporean friends took us there for lunch. Although we had made a reservation, the restaurant wasn't that full. Lunch was good & creative, but the portions are rather small. The music in the toilet is very loud.
4
Tasty food and nice ambience. I had Spicy Brussels Sprouts, Truffle Roast Duck, Stuffed Squid and Longan & Red Dates for drink. To me, is a bit too expansive for that drink. Overall, is a restaurant that I will still patronize. üëçüèª
5
Xiao Ya Tou is one of my to go places. The manager on duty is always awesome and his recommendations are always on point and his cheerful mood, contagious. Of all the times i have visited the place, service has always been impeccable.Must trys (and also my favs):- Otak rolls (Dinner) / Otak Rojak (lunch)- Hokkien Mee (dinner)- Seafood Mee Sua (lunch)- Truffle duck (Dinner)- Stuffed Sotong (dinner)- Lu Rou fan (lunch and dinner
4
Xiao Ya Tou has a relatively small menu with local-infused brunch items on their menu. Definitely more hits than misses since the chef can have better QC control on a selective list of items.Drinks are over priced imho. Especially cocktails which seems to be on the high side. Food items are priced at above average level but for the quality, I wouldnt mind paying abit more to spend a lazy weekend afternoon with my family
5
Went to Xiao Ya Tou for a Burpple exclusive 1-for-1 brunch with my bf. Based on guides on Burpple, this has already been one of my bookmarked locations. Food didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t disappoint, it was a great fusion of asian tastes with a western presentation style. Great price due to the promo! Only thing was that it was slightly noisy from the music being played and the sound of the wok hey. Overall, was a great place for brunch
5
It is an unforgetful dinner where we enjoyes the roasted duck and baby spinach with flower egg soup.The roasted duck meat is soft and tender although it can be more tastier.The environment is cosy and definitely one of the places yhat you want to enjoy local fusion food
4
I went there for lunch, I had the Hokkien mee, carrot cake and coconut dessert.. the taste of the food was really tasty. The service was very attentive and friendly..
5
Been here a couple of times & on each visit, it never ever disappoints! Beautiful & creative flavours which give old school favourites a fantastic makeover!
4
I went there with my family. We ordered clams, eggplant, beef, and spinich with rice. The food is delicious and the ambiance is great. Will come again!
5
Love the twist to the asian dishes making it really interesting. Must try Otak, Druken Flower Clams and Angus Short ribs (THE BEST, literally melt in your mouth!).
5
Great ambience and fusion food, whether for brunch or dinner. Would definitely be coming again and again.
4
A modern fusion restaurant that serve very unique dishes. We ordered the famous crispy otah rolls and cock wings, both are nice and tasty. Abit pricey for the amount of portion served. Expect a little damage to your wallet
5
Food was generally expensive but most were good. The otak rolls and coconut tau huay were excellent. Restaurant was nicely decorated but lighting was alittle dim.
4
Service is great, very attentive. We had a hard time choosing foods and cocktails, because everything in the menu seems to be very interesting/delicious. Highly recommended their char siew and XYT signature cocktails. I'll love to be back again !
5
Xiao Ya Touch offers a different kind of brunch if you are tired of the usual egg Ben, sandwiches and croissant. A unique fusion of Asian and western cuisines that tickle your taste bud with nice blend of multiple flavors.Modern trendy music fuse with vintage Asian and Shanghai decor. It gives you a wholesome experience besides the yummy food. Definitely a nice twist to your Sunday afternoon
5
well i did expect it to be pretty good, but i wasnt anywhere near prepared to be blown away. got the all for pork which was amazingly tender and flavourful, but the dessert coconut tau huay was divine, you got the try the multitude of flavours in that dessert
4
Bringing Chinese food to the next level~ Love the eggplants with clams, squid with otar fillings & roasted chicken!! =)
4
With bacon bits and lard, the prawn noodles was so well cooked, even better than the ones I had at Hawker centres!!
5
The restaurant is decorated tastefully using all sorts of stuffs from the past.
The food, innovatively modified to further enrich the flavour never fails to surprise you.
Definitely recommended.
5
Top quality food and drinks. Great ambience to chit chat. Would definitely come back again. Good for sharing.
5
Great food with great ambience. Highly recommend the Hokkien mee! Interesting menu & drinks. Went back twice in a week!
5
The food is absolutely delicious and the atmosphere is fun to boot. This fusion restaurant combines flavours perfectly and every dish we tried was a real stand out. Anyone who goes must have at least one cocktail and the beef short rib.
4
Local food make a twist! Ordered the truffle roast duck and Lu Rou Fan, still can't forget the taste and honestly mind blowing by the Lu Rou Fan. Still can't get over how tender and juicy the braised beef was! Definitely looking forward to my next visit there!
4
XYT has very interesting ambience, it‚Äôs as if you have stepped into a time machine and went back to the past (in short, very old school vibe). most of the dishes we were ordered were good, even though they were on the pricey side. my favourites would be the carrot cake (aka chay tow kueh), unagi benedict and pork knuckles fritters. the salmon salad is okay if you need some greens to go along with your other dishes, it has the current hyped poke bowl feel. i didn‚Äôt really enjoy the otak rojak (it really felt like a ‚Äúrojak‚Äù, rather than tasting like one). drinks are pretty pricey too even though they are all named creatively. i‚Äôd go back if there is an occasion or if i crave for the unagi benedict
4
Went to Xiao Ya Tou for dinner. Seems like their brunch menu is better than their dinner menu. Nevertheless, yummy Hokkien mee and truffle duck. The beef for the lu rou fan was a bit on the salty side. Worth a visit, though pricey. Wished the music playlist wasn‚Äôt pop songs though haha.
4
Had brunch here. Restaurant has a very Hip chinese feel. The menu is quite interesting, i had the unagi benedict and surprisingly it tastes good! My friend had the chai tou kuay (chinese carrot cake) which was abit too exotic for our liking.The drinks menu could be improved on. More traditional chinese coffee or drinks should be added to the menu
4
interesting concepts with a fusion of different cuisines that excite your palate - i would be back to try more dishes!
4
New and fresh. Good food .But appetizers a bit over value. Not worth it. The main is good . With be returning patron
5
service was prompt and very good! old school setting kind of environment with nice brunch food items as well.
4
Ambience is nice and food is nice. Must try the unagi burger. Portion is a little small though. Servers are friendly.
5
wonderful fusion food, the chef really knows how to combine the different ingredients together to create a unique taste & experience for diners.. the portion is quite small thou for the price.. recommend the unagi benedict and pork knuckles and coconut tau huay..
5
Excellent execution of classics with a avant garde twist. Tried the Hokkien mee with wok hei & rich broth base, prawns were fresh & the bacon & pork lard complements the dish nicely. Gu gu ngoh hiang is crispy on the outside & juicy inside. Lu rou fan is not what we envisioned (the fatty melt in your mouth Taiwanese style) but the namesake is still valid as the beef is braised & very flavorful which resembles the concentrated flavors in the beef jerky from Taiwan. Only gripe is high price for small serving
1
The name of the restuarant and the highlight of Modern Asian food sounded promising. The restuarant was decorated with artefacts from the 60s. The service was attentive. The food however was utterly disappointing. Trying too hard with a mixed of too much ‚Äúfusion‚Äù. The dishes ended up lost with no character. The recommended Unagi Benedict is a must ‚Äúdon‚Äôt try‚Äù. The Chai Tow kway had the saving grace of the dried shrimps that carried the taste. Good thing they served small portions so we didn‚Äôt feel too bad leaving most of it untouched. Pricey as well easily will set you back 60 bucks for two for bad food. We got out of the place pretty quickly and went to another place with real chefs.
4
Familiar local favourites elevated to near-perfection. Well-curated menu that showcased the chefs' strengths. Only wish was for better description of mains and sides on the menu. Pricing of sides was also similar to mains so those weren't so much value. But overall, taste-wise, couldn't have asked for better
5
The lady boss was very good! The kitchen was closed till 6pm but she asked one of the staff to ask kitchen to prepare a few small bites for us! Another lady was very nice and keep checking with us whether we need more foods! Dumpling and Minced Pork so tasty! Will definitely come back and visit them

Xiao Ya Tou is located in a quaint shophouse that‚Äôs decorated with really eclectic curios from the olden times of Singapore. It gives the restaurant a lot of character, but it also means that it isn‚Äôt the most comfortable place to dine in. The restaurant is air conditioned but the doors are also wide open, meaning that it isn‚Äôt particularly cool and feels almost as humid as the outdoors.The service at Xiao Ya Tou was excellent, with very friendly servers who were attentive and approachable. Karen, whom I‚Äôm assuming is the manager, also reached out after our dinner to ensure that we had a pleasant experience and asked for feedback regarding our experience.On to the food, we had ordered the truffled roasted duck, angus beef short ribs, and the eggplant with clams. The truffled roasted duck was really moist and flavorful. They were also really generous with the truffle shavings. The only thing I wouldn‚Äôt suggest to make it better is perhaps to roast the duck for longer, to render the fat down more and have crispier skin. The angus short ribs was amazing - it was melt in your mouth tender and the goma sauce that accompanied it paired perfectly. If the exterior had a slightly crispy and caramelized sear, it would be absolutely perfect. The clams and eggplant dish was good, but I would‚Äôve preferred if the eggplants were sliced into medallions instead.We had also ordered two cocktails, the Opium and Unrequited Love. They were interesting, but I probably would not order them again the next time I dine; the Opium was strong but extremely little, and the Unrequited Love was quite a lot but very weak.Overall, Xiao Ya Tou is a great addition to the area which is already littered with some excellent restaurants ranging from casual to fine dining
4
Unique creation of dishes , was served complimentary dessert afterwhich. Serving was small though for the pricing paid
5
Yummy food and awesome location. Food taste good and looks exactly the same as the pictures online. Brunch experience was really good
5
Another great little restaurant serving local dishes with a twist in a fun environment; love the area too
4
Was a lovely place to dine in. Impressed by the service crew's prompt response and smiles. Food, however good, came in too small portions though, rendering the prices on the menu a tad ex....
4
XYT's food is generally very good. Especially the hokkien mee - so tasty and full of umami flavour! Love that the cafe has a retro theme for a nostalgic feel.
5
Food Quality: Good
Drinks: Fair
Atmosphere: Good
Price: pricey (expected. It's at Duxton Hill. duh.)
Food was surprisingly tasty and i just LOVE the decor.
Would highly recommend his place.
5
Love the ambience and the food was da bomb! one of the best chinese cuisine you can ever get. Not to mention the terrific happy hour till 8pm.
4
Went with family and had brunch. Ordered fried carrot cake, mee suah, fried pork fritters, unagi sandwiches, otah, braised beef bowl, etc. The dishes were original, on the steep side with relatively small portion. Expect to spend at least $30++ per pax with a drink.
4
My friends and I had read about this place so decided to go. Unfortunately, I was terribly hungover. But the lime and sour plum soda + refreshing avocado salad spruced me right up again. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. The menu was full of familiar items with a twist making it feel like an 'atas kopitiam.' Food was delicious and came out rather promptly. Would definitely go back again!
4
Ambience and atmosphere - chill and nice, went during lunch and not crowded, the music was good and the dim lights really gave a nice cafe feel, decor is a plus too! Food - very good! Maybe a bit on the $$ side but the quality is of a good standard! Coffee is great as well! Service - quick and helpful, attentive to customers and polite as well! Overall - 7/10 experience!
3
Food is great here (chinese fusion) but i cant say the same for their drinks and service.
Dinner n lunch menus are different so make sure you check out what they serve beforw visiting.
4
Excellent Food with a local twist. Amazing presentation and quality. However, the service staff seem a little overwhelmed.
4
2nd visit to this place. Good food and ambience. Service is also excellent. Only that pricing is quite steep.
5
Fusion brunch item such as Unagi Benedict is good! Good flatwhite too! And I love the restaurant vibe and setting.
So hipster and lively!
Will be back again soon!
Thumbs up to the team behind this establishment!
Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5
Located on duxton hill , xiao ya tou offer a variety of delicious chinese food. Affordable cocktails and wine list. Fantastic ambience, great service staffs and one of the best chinese food my friends and I had eaten. My favorite dishes are the dumplings, flower clams, chicken wings , market fish, beef short ribs and the prawn noodle. Reservation is reccomended as it was quite pack when we went for dinner . We are going back to check out their interesting brunch menu soo
4
Xiao ya tou is a restaurant near by trans street that is perfectly for a adventure taste and visual ride. The place is nicely deco with old school items and the ambience is real good. Food wise, the chicken is nicely cooked and fritters will also mouthful
2
Ordered 3 drinks, 3 dishesAyam percik - skip this, waste of money! $24 with half roasted chicken. Nothing fantastic, chicken isn't that tender, the sauce taste like a curry saucePork - $18Not too bad, tender, but nothing greatHokkianmee - $16Hawker center hokkian mie is $4-5 dlr only, for this hokkianmie there are big prawns, lala. The taste of it is quite eggy, not too bad but lack of wok smell. I think $16 is expensive for a bowl of itAmbience is good, interesting place to be. Service is fast and friendly... But...Once we finished our food my friend noticed that the store manager kept looking us! We were offered dessert but we rejected because we re too full. We get the feeling of why we are still sitting there when we have finished our meal, but yet there s no queue outiside and the crowd wasnt great either? Why cant we just sit there and chat?Based on today's experience in term of service and food.. not coming back.. with that price of food, there re money places with better food, and better service.
4
Great fusion menu and we ordered quite a variety of food. Most of them taste delicious. Thumbs up! Cocktails might be too adventurous for most. Most importantly, the service is really good. Atmosphere was light hearted and the servers were really polite and nice. That helps alo
4
I had a quick lunch at the restaurant this week with a work colleague after we had a work meeting outside the office. The quirky look of the restaurant attracted our attention as we looked at a few options in the vicinity. The restaurant serve local food but with more modern twist and enhanced ingredients. For example Hokkien Mee has big prawns in it and looks like a pasta version. It's tasty but also cost a lot more than a typical dish. Service was friendly. Recommended
4
Love the decor and the food. Went on a Monday night, the place was rather quiet and cozy.Some of us felt the "hawker food" was way overpriced, $16 for a plate of hokkien mee. (Hmm ..3 big prawns and meaty clams)I don't mind going back on occasions. But will definitely become a regular if the food prices can be reduced by 25% Cheers
4
A unique twist to Asian dishes, with a slight nostalgic feel. Good for occasion meals or entertaining tourists. Came on a Chope 1 for 1 offer which made the dining experience especially yummy.
5
Food is good. My 7 years old girl loves the place. Full of interesting oddies decoration. You will definitely go back again. I bought more vouchers for dine in.
4
Chanced upon this restaurant with my friends. Food is relatively good but pricey. Would recommend to visit.
5
Interesting flavours as the restaurant is focused on fusion food with some Chinese elements. Especially enjoyed the short ribs! Highly recommended!
3
Basically, you pay for the Duxton Hill ambience. Nothing fantastic about the food. Be prepared to pay $12++ for a glass of fruit juice.
5
Decor was superb! Fusion food at its best! We had 4 mains and there were all delicious! Love my quinoa! Service was fantastic!
4
I felt that the Chai Tow Kway was too pricey and tasted quite average thou it was interesting and different from how it's prepared normally. With such a pricing on it I will rather chose other dishes. The braised wagyu beef on rice is quite good! Non oily and I like how the low temperature egg enhances the whole dish. Price is reasonable for this. Waitress was friendly
3
Food and especially drinks are too expensive. People will only visit once to have a try I guessed. The food portion is small. But cock wings is nice. Other dishes not that bad too.The drinks are extremely high priced. Overall, they only attract ppl to eat there due to their deco. Not a must to visit anyway.
5
Happened to have lunch in XYT on last Sunday. Food was good and ambiance was great! Will definitely go back again especially for dinner.Too bad that I'm a Buddhist, can not take beef. Hope XYT can come out the menu for Lu Rou Fan with Pork. :
4
Every one of the 10 dishes our party of 4 shared was decent at the very least, with a few stand outs. The kurobuta char siew was very good by any standard, and all the more impressive coming from a kitchen which doesn't specialize in it. Also liked the roast chicken with coconut cream and lime - cooking was spot on for moist and tender meat. The eggplant with lamb and chilli yoghurt was also very nicely balanced. The cooking may not have been particularly inventive, but give me solid execution and great flavors over a place which tries too hard and falls flat anyday
4
Small plates are very delicious with a twist of unique taste for chi food =). Awesome place for get together dining.
4
Came during weekday lunch and was disappointed that not much choices to choose for lunch menu...will be a good place to lunch during weekdays if have more choices for the mains...pho xao üëçüèª
5
Chefs did a marvelous work at revamping the classics with contemporary cooking methods. Such mischieve and creativity carried through the presentation of each dish. Flavour combination were on point. Will definitely be back.
3
Environment - ok
Service - so so
Prices - quite expensive
Value - so so
No comments on recommendations
4
I order the beef which is melt in your mouth,the drink is very refreshing also ,coffee is good as well .
5
Great the first time round, even better this time. They revamp the menu every quarter and it's always good.
4
Chinese food was pretty decent, considering this "posh" setting. The Baby Spinach and Wagyu Beef rice were exceptionally delicious. Variety slightly limited but still sufficient to satisfy my craving. Worth a return visit.
3
Service was prompt, in fact too prompt, waitress was so enthusiastic in clearing the table even when there are food left on the plate, food was not good, hated their rendition of the pork knuckle. Loved their hokkien mee. Drinks are way way way overpriced!!
4
Food was decent. Portions can be a little small. However, the pork ribs croissant was delectable. The meat was succulent and tender.
4
Highly recommended if you are looking for a different brunch experience... gone are the typical pancake, eggs, waffles... only to be replaced with an interesting menu with local dishes reinvented! Unagi benedict is good but a tad oily, Otah Alio Oligo is divine! Grilled Chix salad is great...Make room for dessert
4
Been here thrice now. Food is interesting and good. They tend to be sweet so if you don't like sweet stuff, be warned
4
Went there for easter brunch with family. Enjoyed the spiked milo cocktail very much. Portions were a tad small for the price though. Service was great and the decor was beautiful.
3
The chicken wings and otah snack was great, the ngoh hiang, and char kway tiao and prawn noodles were good but not worth the price.
Service was decent but the service staff looked lost.
The music was overly loud and made talking difficult.
5
Nice olden days kind of decor. We had Unagi Benedict, Pork Ribs croissant and Mentaiko MAC and Cheese. Portions are generous and good quality.
4
Staffs were prompt and friendly, place has a good retro vibe and food is tasty. Was recommended several dishes and all to my liking, definitely will come back with my friends and family again.
4
Had brunch during the weekend, Food is marvelous. Love their twist to traditional food. Service is superb. Would be coming back to try other dishes.
4
Xiao Ya Tou is not your typical high concept fusion chinese fine dining restaurant. The menu is interesting but reasonably priced for the quality fares that they put out to surprise diner's palate.Selection is not as wide as I have thought but all the dishes that they hve created are fairly memorable, even for the grilled chicken wings that was infused with lemongrass. Best dish for me is the Flower Clam with wine! Truly a gem! Otak spring roll is also a delight.They only have 2 desserts on their dinner menu... though the portion is relatively small.. they are very well executed
4
We got there a few minutes before the kitchen closes at 3:30pm on a sunday, but they were accommodating! Since it's a lazy sunday, and we got there late, we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The decor of the place makes it worth visiting and I certainly intend to bring my foreign friends there when they visit! We only had the Unagi Benedict and some drinks. Quality of food is good and I would recommend!
4
We are fans of their omelette and whole Ayam which was very flavorful and well seasoned. Entering the place, from the retro music, dedicated menu to the toilet's decor teleported us back to the feel of early 90s... and somehow had a very good nostalgic feel.
5
Xiao Ya Tou was such a pleasant dining experience for my family and I. The decor of the restaurant is consistent throughout with a Asian retro theme in mind, allowing one to reminisce of their childhood days. This is interestingly complemented with Western Pop music in the background. The food served did not disappoint a bit! We ordered several dishes, a couple of cocktails and ended off with desserts. All the dishes were served promptly and were extremely appetizing! Our Top 3 dishes for the evening were Twice cooked short ribs, Hokkien Mee and Baby Spinach! The ribs were so tender and appetizing, the Hokkien Mee fragrant and the Baby Spinach so mouthwatering! We would definitely recommend this place and be back for more
5
Nice cafe with unique food. The setup was unique and quite refreshing. The service staff was courteous as well.
4
Love the decoration but felt that the food is abit pricey. Still, i will recommend the place as the food is pretty good.
5
Love the decor of the cafe and the food we had for dinner was good.
Though the dessert I had was a thad disappointing.
4
Love the concept of modernising old chinese cuisines. The beef rib and otak otak were awesome. Pork knuckle fritters was slightly too fried for me.
4
It was awesome for first half. Too gelate after the first half! Perhaps something more refreshing for the other half? Very gorgeous and lovely decor and ambience, would love to be back to try others
5
Excellent setting and ambience with contemporary, modern fusion of controversial pictures. A pretty fun experience and great food we can testify!
3
This is my 2nd visit there and I don't mind this place because I love eggs. Dishes are innovative, food average. Worth a first try.
4
Good ambience, but the music did not fit the theme and the food was quite pricey. Ended up with a bill of $140++ by ordering 5 dishes and 1 pint of beer.
3
i had dinner here with my boyfriend and we ordered several dishes. My favourite dish was the hokkien mee while the other dishes were just okay and nothing special. The clams had too much sand in it and we felt we were eating sand when we tried to suck the clam meat out from the shellWe paid around 100USD for two people no drinks which is very pricey for some local singapore food in singapor
3
the moment i stepped into Xiao ya Tou i felt like i was transported to another time. the interior was very unique and quirky. before our mains arrived, we were given complimentary mantou buns with soup. i ordered the unagi benedict ($which was pretty good! the bread base were mantous buns. i would order this again.. bf had XYT breakfast ($21); one of the best scrambled eggs i've had in a while, with corned beef and roasted potatoes and salad. overall an interesting experience :) would recommend to try at least once
4
Loved the decor! The unagi Benedict was filling and yummy, very good eggs and the unagi was fresh and succulent. I also appreciated the mantou/tau suan appetiser served with every main. Tau suan was a bit watery and could be improved upon.
5
Eaten here twice recently-both times great fun, due in equal parts to the menu, service, decor and overall ambience. They get it right, at least for me. We'll be back!
4
The atmosphere was vibrant with a very young crowd. Music was a tat too loud. Seating was a bit tight. Food although was not expensive, it wasn't exactly cheap too. The food had good flavors and were done imaginatively with a fusion of the west into our local hawker flare. All in all a pleasant experience at a cafe which is not pretentious
3
Not your standard brunch menu that you typically see in brunch places in Singapore.Singaporean vibe-infused from menu to setting and ambiences (not so much on the prices though which seem to be on the steep side). Definitely some hits and misses in the food side. Chicken salad was passable. Otak aglio aglio suprises... but Salmon confit was a let down as the fish was not seared well... Dessert was well executed but not sure if I will order again for the price tag.Overall, an interesting place to try out if you are sick of the usual fares for brunch.
3
Naughty modern Asian restaurant., enjoying Asian cuisine with a modern twist while being immersed in the good old days deco. The stirrer and food menu was an eye catcher.. Service from the staff was very attentive, love it. Food was alright but pricey for the portion served, not an ideal place to chat as the music is far too loud indoors
5
My views on restaurants are usually mixed - great food but a little expensive for what it was, service was great but food not wow. Xiao Ya Tou was impeccable on every front.Food was absolutely on point in taste and presentation. My absolutely favourite was the beef short ribs, which was tender perfection. Another close favourite was the crab foo yong - I like eggs. My friends loved their reconstructed otah and ngorhiang (not my thing but I felt it deserved a mention).The staff are absolutely lovely - they treat people like people, not simply mouths and wallets. It's easy going friendliness. Usually I only see this with foreign wait staff but Xiao Ya Tou's local and foreign staff were simply lovely. One of the waiters even told us to stop ordering at one point and see how we felt before ordering more, a good thing to avoid food wastage. After all, if the food is good and we're still hungry, we're bound to want more, no?What's more, they're dog friendly! We took our two dogs who were happy troopers enjoying the people watching and smells. Too bad they couldn't partake
3
Restaurant's classified as 'fusion', however the items served seems to be more pure Chinese in taste and presentation - seems to lack some creativity if they did set out to be a fusion restaurant? Having said that, the food was still decent however nothing jumps out as unique. They charged $6 for soda too, which is pretty steep in my opinion
4
One reason that enticed me to visit this place was that it was described as kid- friendly in the Chope app among other things. This turned out to be wrong info! This place is definitely NOT for kids - nothing on the menu caters to kids (I had to explain to my daughter that she could not have "Milo Dinosaur" on the drinks menu as it has alcohol in it). No cutlery for kids either. Interesting retro decor. Limited choice of dishes on the menu. Food tastes great and the dishes have fun, tongue-in-cheek names. However, the prices are on the high side, which probably explains why there were hardly any customers on a Sat evening.
3
The service staff was wonderful - she came over to give us her recommendations, knowing that we were pretty lost on what to order since the menu variety wasn't small to begin with. The atmosphere is wonderful as well - brings you to a completely different world, pretty much like Singapore in the olden days. That aside, though the food was great in taste, the portion was really small. If you're looking to pig out, this isn't the place. It feels more like sampling items, rather than having a dinner. That aside, I highly recommend going for the spinach and the wings!
5
You can call this a pricey tzi char place but if you consider the ingredients, the plating and quality of food, it's definitely worth the money. Excellent food and drinks, the ambience was really refreshing too, good for any sort of gathering with friends or family. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience there
