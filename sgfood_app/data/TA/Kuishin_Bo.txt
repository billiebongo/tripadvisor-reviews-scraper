If you like sushi/sashimi this is the place for you! Really good restaurant with all-you-can-eat buffet. Recommended
5
Wide spread of Japanese food yo choose from, free flow of sashimi, snow crab, tempura, dessert including chocolate fondue
3
Another buffet place with hit and misses, variety was good and some food tasted great, raw seafood counter was acceptable. Great!
4
There are plenty of food to choose for the buffet. Seafood, fried food, dessert and many others. The buffet spread is in a straight line so you will have to exercise your legs while getting all the food. Just skip the coffee machine. Coffee is not that nice.

It was my first time at Kuishin Bo and i thought the experience was mediocre. Nothing too fanciful on the layout and premise except that it can be squeezy along the aisle especially during a weekend meal. -1 for comfortWe were there with the family for a birthday celebration. Called in 1 week ahead of time but apparently they didn't take our reservation, at all?! It was for 10 persons so we were a little frantic at first but the staff managed to resolve it quick enough to cause a huge stir. nonetheless, -1 for service.food was so-so - nothing fantastic, nothing really out of the ordinary, and furthermore expensive since it was priced at $67 per pax for dinner. For the price, I would have opted instead for a buffet dinner at an established hotel - would have gotten more value for money. -1 for pricing.They do have an hourly "surprise" dish for only the first 30 customers. You would however have to queue and wait your turn as soon as the jingle is heard overhead. I would say this is really a gimmick since it doesn't seem to be a "lavish" dish. -1 for marketing ploy. Not likely to return as there are better restaurants out there

Got there once for lunch and I was impressed by the lavish buffet full of various Japanese food. It may be too busy and crowded especially at lunch time when it is full with people from the nearby offices. Nevertheless, the trays were frequently replenished and the food was freshly cooked and delicious. I emphasized on the sea food and especially the sushi and tuna sashimi, which I did like, but many other options were available for every taste - warm food, tepanyaki, yakitori, tempura, soups and desserts.  The staff are quite indifferent, especially the girls who clean the tables, and sometimes they can even take a plate you have not finished yet.  I think it is a bit pricey, good if you are too hungry. I used the "Weekday Special60 minutes lunch which was a bargain. They have discount for kids and seniors though.  I could give it another try
4
We celebrated my motherâ€™s birthday at this restaurant last weekend. Useful to make a reservation as there is usually a crowd in the weekend. There is a wide selection of snow crabs, prawns, sushi, tempura, Japanese paper steamboat, noodles. There is a also a chocolate fountain which is favourite with the kids.
4
Only knowing that Kuishin Bo had discounts for seniors, a group of six of us went there for a weekday buffet lunch to celebrate the birthdays of two of us. A pleasant surprise awaited us when we sat down and read the promotions for birthday guests. A discount percentage equal to the age of the birthday guest was offered. With two of us having our birthdays in Oct, both of us enjoyed 67% discounts to our bill. Notwithstanding the bargain, the spread was too much for us to try everything. Even selecting just what we liked, it was sufficient to fill us to the brim, hardly leaving any space for 2nd round of favourites. Hot choice items got depleted fast but the attentive staff worked tirelessly to top them up. We need a few more visits to try everything

Go there for dinner . This restaurant buffet got wide range of Japanese food . Their seafood , sushi , sashimi all are very fresh . Got many kinds of delicious cooked food like ginseng porridge. Dessert is nice too . At weekday lunch got special price ( $ 24.90++) ( 60mins ) . I go there to have lunch and dinner sometimes already . Will go there again . Before going , please book table , otherwise must wait long time then have table

Went to Kushinbo for our department lunch and was greeted by a wide spread of food. We were excited initially till we get our hands on the food. The food taste really bad. Sashimi wasn't very fresh, Kami Nabe with chicken soup was very salty, chicken skewer and oden soup was salty and the items used are those bad quality frozen items. Salmon skin wasn't that crispy. Nothing to rave about their dessert bar. Most of them taste either average or just way too sweet. I heard from my colleagues who have visited Kushinbo before, the food was great in the past but now it was really way below average. It was a great place to gather thou but I will not go back or recommend my friends as the food is not up to standard
3
We come here for lunch, eventhough no crab served for lunch during our visit, we quite enjoy the seafood, sashimi, hot pot, sushi, sob, udon, soup, fried dishes, dessert etc
Service quite good. Chef replenish quite fast and waiter quite attentive.
4
Love the ambiance of this restaurant. If you are into Japanese food, then this is for you. The food are great specially their sashimi. There are also sweet treats for dessert. Definitely will come back here.
4
Had a see of party for one of our colleague and went there for dinner. It's a very lavish buffet and all kid of Japanese food. The spread is quite big. It's degeneracy worth if you are a foodie.
3
The buffet has a lot of choice, but in my opinion it is a little overpriced. If you are a sushi lover and don't like to eat to much, you'd better go elsewhere.
4
This is a popular Japanese buffet outlet located in Suntec City. For senior citizens (above 55 years old), there is a discounted rate. There is a large variety of choice even for lunch. The main attraction is the sashimi and sushi which was fresh. There is also the grill section, salads, tempura, soups, noodles, appetizers, desserts, and many more. There are a choice of soft drinks and water (immersed in vegetables & fruits)My favorite is the salmon & tuna sashimi, grilled salmon head, fried salmon skin, cold soba, and prawns & vegetables tempura.You will be spoilt for choice and probably one of the better Japanese buffet in Singapore.

Have lunch on Sunday afternoon. Love the interior, makes me feel like I am in Japan. Big restaurant and spacious seating. Plenty of food to choose from. Love the tuna and salmon sashimi. Real thick and fresh. The tempura, vege fritters, chicken wings were nice too. There is another section for teppanyaki and grill meat, soba and poached eggs. Wow everything I tried taste good. My favourite, mochi. There are a few kinds of mochi and all taste awesome. These are stuff that are difficult to find outside this restaurant so I simply love it. I paid $38++ per person for lunch on Sunday. I think it is really worth it. Only set back is there are shortage of waiting staff to clear our plates. So with the small tables, we need to squeeze a little bit. However, the food quality makes us happy with the service set back
3
Went for Christmas Dinner with friends. The food was average, but some items were miserable. The Creme Brulee that 5 of us took, only one was properly set, the rest were all watery. There was no wine, though it was on the menu - we ended up ordering sake.Sushi and kaminabe were relatively okay
2
The quality of the food here had gone downhill. Many of the items like the sashimi were really low grade kind of stuff. At this price, I seriously expect some good quality food. The only good thing about this restaurant was the variety of food. Service wise, pretty ok as our plates were cleared very frequently!Why 2 stars? Price..
2
Table reserved for 5 person, the seating is not comfortable and narrow. Is very inconvenienced for the middle person to come out to get food. The table behind you will keep banging to your seat whenever they move in and out. The waitress do not know the basic table service. She (Ela) simply clear your plate and sauce away without asking. She even instructed us to passed her the empty plates from 3 seats away. Food top up is very slow and we don't even got the chance to taste the deep fried soft shell crabs the whole 2 and half hours there. The baked cheese lobster only being served once in an hour with limited plates (we think 50 only). 1st serving we don't get it at 8 and only get it during 2nd serving at 9 and disappointed as the cheese and the lobster meat is too dry & hard. The snow crabs, i think they purposely make it very very salty so that you won't be able to eat. All my staff is complaining about the over salt snow crab which make them feel so upset with the whole dining experience. So for those with health issues like high blood pressure, i think you should all avoid it. The restaurant dinner open from 5.30-10pm but the service staff start to bring out the mops and at 9.10pm. The same goes to the live kitchen staff, they start to clean the glass and stove before 9pm. As this is department dinner so we would like to spend sometimes chatting but the face expression from the staff is like "Still don't want to leave??" This is the only Japanese restaurant that i encounter which such lousy services. I won't recommend this place to any other people as i think to get such similar food, the restaurant at MBS basement worth more much then what you spend here
4
The spread include fresh seafood, sushi, hot items, kaminabe, drinks and dessert section. The limited premium items are typically announced through the classic "Dong Dong Dong" jingle and it was cheese baked lobster and oyster for that night. What's great • Fresh prawns, mud crab, snow crab • Beef kaminabe - beef slices were fresh and fragrant • Fried fish skin• Dessert section was wonderful with a spread of quality matcha ice cream, cakes, assorted pralines, mini macaroons, soft mochi and fruits etc. What's not so great • Salmon sashimi - the texture wasn't very smooth and not as tasty as expected. • Grilled saba was hard • Would have been great if they serve fresh oysters We went on a Friday evening and paid about $70 nett per pax ($58++). Personally I felt it was overpriced if you are an average eater. Nearest carpark would be Suntec North Wing.
4
Great place for buffer dinner or lunch.
A lot of varieties and the foods is very fresh.
Very crowded during dinner times and weekends.
Worth to try.
3
I visited here to celebrate new joiner of my team.
It was good variety of food. You can enjoy soba, udon, sashimi, sushi kind of popular Japanese Cusine.
4
Wide array of seafood available and very appetising range of dessert. Sashimi's fresh and refills for food come by very regularly. Gets pretty crowded even on weekday evenings, be sure to make a reservation. Worth a try.
3
The range of food offered was quite good especially the sashimi. The crab legs however was too salty and lack the sweetness of crab meat. There are also no utensils provided to aid us in breaking the crabs shell and the staff are not very prompt in helping us clear our plates making it inconvenient for us to get more food to the table
5
If you want to come here, you better prepare your tummy, and better prepare it well. Food good, great variety, and I do mean variety... location a bit at the end, but easy to find. price is high, so if you come here, better make sure you can eat alot. :
4
I went to Kuishin Bo for dinner outing with my office colleagues to celebrate someone birthday.We enjoy the meal very much .It got wide variety of sushi, sashimi and japanese dishes. and desserts.The staffs there are very cooperative. they allowed us to use our birthday cake to eat and even provide plate and cutlery.One manager of Kushin Bo is willing to take group pic of us even though the place very crowded . 
4
We were passing and saw the deal for $19++pp 15:30 to 17:00pm. Kids eat free. Don't expect all the bells and whistles to be served, there is a reason it is this price. Nevertheless, what was on offer was nice and varied. Good sweet table, chocolate fountain. Sushi and fried assortments. Tea/coffee and soft drinks. It actually wasn't bad and the kids sweet dispenser was great for the little one. Give it a go if you are in Suntec one weekend afternoon
1
I love to eat out. I love when a buffet offers lots of varieties so I can truly appreciate the food culture. This place looks nice from the outside, but when you eat the food it just didn't do it for me. I love to eat uni and was happy to see that they have it there. But when I ate it, I immediately had to spit it out. The quality was really bad and that just set the tone for the remaining of the dinner for me. I cut my losses and decided to take off without being full and happy! I call this place flat out overpriced mall restaurant food
4
Been here with friends for a lunch gathering and the place is not big enough so we had to split about 8 per group. However, since its buffet, we just walked around grabbing food most of the time. There are a wide spread of everything from sushi, sashimi, seafood, soup (consider they have 2 + 1 porridge), international dishes and lots and lots of desert.Originally, I would expect its pure Japanese food, but seems like time had made this restaurant adapted too to local taste and some local style food are served as well. Although I won't consider these the strong point. The food is above average, but it differs in quality depending on whether you got them hot or cold, like the soft shell crabs. So for the best experience, grab them while they are are out hot. We tried almost all the Japanese stuff from steam eggs, sushi, salmons and all. I would say they are above average and I would say I would like to visit again. However, you may want to consider leaving some space for desert too since they have a large variation from fruits to ice cream to lots of sweet stuff. One thing however to really praise is that drinks are 100% free here unlike some restaurant where you need to pay more for them even in a buffet. From tea, coffee, to colas and juices... all are available. I would recommend the juice if you like something slightly different.Apparently, this place is regularly having offers with coupons and stuff, so make sure you check it out to get the best deal. We came in with a 8 pax but paying only 6, which say its about 25% off. There are other prices where you are given limited time of 1 hour to eat too, but those are never my style and I really like to take my time and enjoy my meal.This is one of the restaurant where reservation is STRONGLY recommended
4
The ambience,food & selection are good but it is very expensive at $58.90++ for full weekends dinner. Momiji Revenue House offers much better value at $42.89++ for weekends dinner. Ambience, food & selection are just as good if not better. They have snow crabs too, including one hour of free flow of Sapporo beer
5
This place is super good value. Well the food quality is not the best but for the price and variety, it's definitely worth it. We had a great time trying all the different food and drinks. No hidden costs. We like!!!
5
If you lunch for just an hour, you get to enjoy $25 per pax. If not, normal rates apply. Great food. Large variety of food. Valuable for money if at $25 per pax.
4
Great variety of foods. The sashimi and crabs are freshly served. Tasty! Worth visiting! Can try out the 1hour limit for a cheaper price if you can eat everything within that hour.
5
Still my fav japanese buffet paradise. Second time visiting (once last year & another this year) the seafood never disappoints, it is always top-notch fresh & everything else is awesome!

It was our first visit to this newly-opened branch where we celebrated my wife's birthday recently. We were there on a weekend just after opening time and the place was already a third full. That bode well as places in Singapore that fill quickly usually serve good stuff. The variety of food was quite extensive with a decent spread of cold dishes (raw mussels and scallops, sashimi and sushi), a teppanyaki selection, paper steamboat (kaminabe), cold and hot noodles, soup, fried finger food, and a dessert selection (fruits, chcocolate fountain, cakes, mochi snacks and jellies). There was also a specialty section featuring dishes from the Nagoya and Shizuoka regions, most of which were pretty tasty. For those with young children in tow, there's a food section for them too offering not-very-Japanese options like...chicken nuggets. Listen out also for a food demonstration that may occur when you're there. During tour visit, staff showed how 'muah chee' (glutinous rice balls coated with finely ground peanut) is made - they then went around offering freshly prepared 'muah chee' to anyone who wanted it - a nice touch. While seating is relatively plentiful, it pays to get there early and make reservations, especially on weekends. Tables are best for parties of up to six persons. We were a party of eleven and had to be accommodated over 3 small tables placed close to allow for easy access to the food aisles. Prices aren't exorbitant, and there are deals for families as well as seniors. As buffets go, it's not going to be voted one of the best on the island. However, it's certainly terrific value if you enjoy Japanese food and have a healthy stamina for buffets
4
For the price, this was a great buffet. The seafood was fresh and of high quality. Some gimmicks like the paper steam boat didn't really work for me. I got stuck visiting the Japanese sashimi and seafood too many times and was too full to try the meats
5
This restaurant is found on the same floor as the Alive Museum. The restaurant offers to prices $24++ for a one hour buffet or $36++ if you stay more than an hour. There is a great selection of salads, sushi, main courses, desserts and also a section for children to make candy floss. They do serve wine, beer and sake, or you can take your wine but it's $10 ++ corkage fee.They also do a an offer for a birthday if it's more than 6 adults if get a cake and free photo. If it's more than 10 adults then you get a cake, picture taken and a bottle of bubbles booking is required.My friend is vegetarian and she found plenty to choose from
4
There are no oysters and lobsters but they have snow crabs and Alaskan King crabs on the seafood bar. ! A wide rage of Japanese foods like tempura, tepanyaki and etc , and the food quality is good. bad to try. The price is about SGD58.90++ for dinner ( About SGD138 for 2 paxs). To me, this price actually is expensive for a restaurant because this almost same rate with some 5 stars hotels.Compared with the dinner, i will prefer the 1-hour express lunch promotion. It's not much difference too but the price is only half of it. (SGD24.90). I suggest if you never try this buffet before, you can try the lunch express first. If you really feel it's pretty good, then you can try it's dinner
5
We went for dinner buffet which costs around $65 with taxes. We also reserved early so we could order lobster as part of our meal. Lobster is available only at Great World City dinner buffet, if reserved before 3 pm. Service was efficient. We were immediately seated on arrival and told to start our meal anytime. Our lobster also arrived in around 10 minutes, without having to remind them. The plates were cleared promptly. The bill was also handled immediately at the end of our meal. As this is a buffet, that is the extent of service needed.Ambience wise the place is a bit cramped. But the restaurant being in prime area, I guess they have to maximize the limited space to keep prices affordable. Now the star : food. The array of food is huge. No way I could have managed to sample everything even if I had taken tiny samples. So I concentrated on seafood, desserts & fruits. All 3 were excellent. I would give five stars just for lobster, snow crab, sashimi platter & scallops. The prawns, mussels & tempura was very good too. In the fried section, I specially loved the fish head & fish fins. Sushi is competent but not one of the best I have had. I wouldn't waste my stomach space on it next time. I didn't eat rice or noodles, but the cold soba looked inviting. In fruits, the guava, pineapple, dragon fruit & watermelon were good break between heavy meal & dessert. The dessert table is extensive, complete with a chocolate fountain. I had the caramel pudding, fruit tarts, raspberry blancmange, red bean mochi, strawberry dipped in chocolate & few chocolates & meringue. Everything was very good. The iced green tea was quite refreshing.Overall an excellent value for money buffet for seafood lovers. Even though we went on empty stomach we were completely full at the end of the meal. Avoid this place if you are dieting

I have been to kuishinbo several times now, the food was good in the past. Quality have been slowly dropping since. But still acceptable. Food variety is quite a spread. Dessert is always GOOD! I have written a full review with pictures on my blog, go to the link below to check it out.https://trytrylor.wordpress.com/2014/06/02/kuishinbo-buffet-great-world-city-review

I've been going to Kuishin Bo with my family several times and trulyl enjoyed the seafood selection and grill. My previous visit in March was a disappointment since the featured Okinawan food was average, to say the least.
4
I wasn't thrilled when my hosts suggested a 'buffet' lunch, but Kuishin Bo is a winner. The ambiance is excellent while food quality and selection (they have everything) is top notch.
4
Great Value at Great World City shopping mall. Buffest is well thought out and many great varieties to choose from.
5
Kuishinbo is THE place to go for me if i am craving for things like snow crabs and prawns. they have make sure their food are constantly good throughout many years. it is really difficult to resist it after you tried it. I go there at least once a month.Kuishinbo have multiple branches, the best one is actually at great wall city. you pay a little bit extra but have better service and more food variety， they even have our door bbq, and cheese baked lobster is available as long as your made any reservation. if you really want to go, you have to book early otherwise you need to wait
2
Visited the place due to the many positive reviews.Was quite disappointed at the quality of the ingredients. Buffets should not be just emphasizing the quantity or variety. Expensive items such as grilled angus beef were given in small portion, we need to order twice but were discouraged by the longer waiting period.We saw lobsters being served but was told that need to make reservation earlier; probably tourist were not their target customers. Sure, we had a full stomach at the end of the meal but I think this place didn't measure up with other Japanese buffet that I have visited in Bangkok, Taipei and KL especially at the price we were paying
5
Was wondering around till this restaurant caught our attention. We went for buffet dinner and if reserved before 3pm, they do give lobster foc. Chocolate fordue welcomed us and best selection includes: paper seafood combo soup, ginseng porridge, fried rice, best-selling crabs, beef, salmon fish head, not forgetting special brew tea served in teapot - ordered total 5 pots for our table! Mind you - the taste and quality is not your regular buffet but at least 2 notches higher. Crowd is from hongkong, japanese and locals. Classy ambience, will definitely come again!
4
This has to be one of the best Japanese buffets that I have been to in a long long time. They have a wide selection of sushi, rolls, steamed chawang mushi to choose from. The quality of food is good – fresh, delicious, and well presented. Although SG30 per meal (when you include everything) sounds expensive, you are really getting a good meal. My only complaint is that we only had one hour to eat all this good food without being charged for more minutes. All in all, my friends and I had a very enjoyable lunch
5
Convenient location at Sunset City Mall. good service. always want to try a bit of everything but it is never possible, because it is just too much of everything. soups, fish, meat, salads, sushi, sashimi, rolls, seafood (crab, mussels, prawns etc.), noodles, rice. plenty of deserts to choose from, fresh fruits. everything is super fresh. definitely my favorite Japanese buffet in Singapore
5
THIS IS A GREAT JAPANESE RESTAURANT IN TOWER 2 OF Suntec 3 Temasek Boulevard . absolutely fabulous buffet spread. If you like Japanese this is a must eat place . Reserve ahead as there is a huge crowd and wait time is more than 30 mins.An exquisite buffet spread with the most fantastic sushi . sashmi and dessert spread. I loved their soups and their tempura was sooo yummy 
5
Though a buffet, you get to try a lot of variety of Japanese food with no restriction other than your own ability to move after the meal..It is crowded so make a reservation. Then, go explore the Japanese food galore like you've never done before. Every thing is good and the restaurant does a good job bringing in the best food. I like the sushi, Sashimi, steam egg, noodles etc. their teriyaki are very authentic.
3
Ok buffet. Not fantastic, but some items are good. Better than Sakura International Buffet.
Strategise what you want to eat!
4
Been there twice now, we love it, huge variety, freshest sashimi, great value, will go again when we go back to SIngapore.
4
They seem to specialise in soba. Food is good but not enough for me to go back all the time
4
A good range of varieties for a japanese buffet dinner. great sashimi, great taste!
4
At SGD22.90++ for the 60-minute express lunch on weekdays (SGD32.90 with no time limit), this is the best value Japanese buffet in Singapore! The spread is most comprehensive and the service very attentive. OK, the quality of the ingredients is not that high, but it's still better than many in town at much steeper prices
4
Nice atmosphere, good selection of food for a price of SGD45.90 ++. Chomped down a loadful of maguro sashimi, a few sticks of yakitori, steamed egg, a bowl of beef nabe and their wide variety of desserts. The place was crowded on a Friday night but service was still superb. The "dong dong dong kuishin bo" chant was quite eerie; sounded like it was taken straight from a horror movie. I raced to get the freebie though, which was two pieces of frozen strawberry. Worth trying
5
This restaurant provides all you can think about if you like Japanese food. The service was excellent, and even though we did not have a reservation on a busy Friday evening, we were seated in less than five minutes. Food is excellent. They even have a chocolate fondue to complete the dinner. It may not be the most romantic restaurant, but everything about this restaurant is excellent
4
In my opinion Kuishin Bo is the best japanese restaurant in Singapore. The food is not only great and a large selection, but the atmosphere is way above average. The buffet is stocked frequently, always fresh and seasoned to perfection. They have very delicious snow crab legs, lobsters, oysters, tempura, yakitori, sushi, shrimp and fish on the buffet that are to die for. Don't forget enjoy their dessert as well! It is awesome.... All I can say is go on a empty stomach and enjoy yourself!I would recommend for a nice dinner, especially if you could not decide what you want to eat
3
Kuishin Bo is a great place to dine with decent buffet prices. Expect to pay around S$45 for buffet dinner. The prices varies for lunch and dinner, and at times there might be promotions if you are eating for just an hour. The best reason why you dine here is when you are hungry and craving for Japanese, especially sashimi. Imagine having to eat as much salmon sashimi as you want without worrying about the price. It is also a great place to dine if you are on a low carbohydrate diet as there are plenty of options to eat such as teppanyaki, soup and of course sashimi. Otherwise, this is a lower standard buffet as compared to those you can find in hotels
5
My teenage son and I were lucky enough to spend Christmas in Singapore and came across a long queue at the Kuishin Bo resturant while shopping at Suntec City. Our Singaporean friends gave us the advise of watching for long queues - there must be something good that people are willing to wait in line for. Unfortunately, it was Christmas Eve, and we didn't have a reservation, and the wait was unbearably long, so we returned for lunch on Christmas day instead.Japanese buffets are my son's favorite in the States (so we have lots of data points to compare to), and we both agree that the quality of the Sushi and Sashimi were among the best we've seen and eaten here. Since it was lunch, the famous crab legs and mini lobsters weren't available, but there were enough of everything else to more than made up for it. Everything was fresh and some cooked to order. The shrimp tempura was fantastic! The deserts were very well presented. There was a small fruit section and a chocolate fountain.The paper steam boat was fun, but really didn't work that well (the flame really isn't hot enough to do much than warm the soup). The seating and layout is a little cramped. But overall, we very much enjoyed this restaurant and count it among the best in Japanese buffets that we've had. We came across another branch of Kuishin Bo at the Great World City mall. This might be another option if you're not at the Suntec City area
5
Great Japanese Buffet at a great price per person. Buffet includes paper steamboat, teppanyaki, sashimi, soft drinks, desserts and alot more.
3
Value for money Japanese buffet
3
Good Japanese buffet
3
Cheap and decent
5
thumbs up 4 their array of Japanese food! comes with freshly brewed coffee and snow crabs in d evenings!
3
fun place and value for money buffet :)
4
Nice! Wide choices of buffet! Wed got ladies nite, much cheaper.
4
$29.90++ on Wed for all ladies. Well worth the price for the excellent snow crab and salmon sashimi! There's even dobin mushi, paper pot, teppanyaki and much much more. The hourly special is a bit gimmicky and not really worth the queue, in my opinion. I missed out on the hourly special dessert so we were sooo full. I will bring my family here next time
5
If you like Japanese food and if you can eat alot this is the place to go! This japanese buffet restuarant has quite a variety of japanese dishes to try. In terms of each dish quality, it is not top notch! But hey.. it's value for money (if you can eat alot!
4
was there for a lunch gathering with about 4 pax at the Suntec outlet. When I saw the place, i thought the seating inside was really cramped. But luckily the saving grace was the quality of the food. I must say they have a huge variety of Jap food for their buffet and was also value for money when we only paid $29.90++ each on a Sunday lunch. So my advice is to go during lunch instead of dinner as the cost can easily go up twice the amount.A Definite recommedation when u have a craving for Jap food
4
Oo.. that price range in US$.. like the food, but not the price. Good that they have some kinda of promotions, that we can enjoy the food at cheaper price
3
Food is decent but not memorable.
3
Japanese buffet. Always got the music when special item is out. Interesting
3
The buffet is expensive but the unlimited flow of snow crab is just worth the value along with other delicious Jap food just tat the sashimi variety is not big.
3
Normal Jap buffet
4
Serve authentic Japanese buffet at reasonable price
4
Must go before 7pm...if not you'll have to make reservation and you get discount of $5 I think if you pay before 7pm. And nevetheless I love JAPANESE FOOD!
3
Big variety at reasonable price
4
wow! one of the best jap buffets i have ever had. i find the concept of the 30 min specials amusing. if you are lucky you might just end up with a lobster as your special treat for the day!
5
I simply love the spread of food and of course the sashimi and the snow crab.
