Had the most lovely meal and service at this restaurant. The seafood soup and pistachio lava cake are must tries. So is the salted egg prawn pasta. Good for friends and family to catch up over delicious food at this restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere.

Had drinks and pizza. Pizza was rather ordinary. Dough was a bit too thick for my liking. Service was decent.

The salted egg pizza and pasta were both the first that I had tasted. The salted egg pizza was not overly salty but has a mild tinge of salted egg taste. Very well done.

With a seating capacity of 40 pax, this place surprised me at my first visit. I especially enjoyed the Tom Yum Seafood Risotto that arrived with such a fragrance. Love their Roasted Pork Belly Pizza as I had that with their Asahi Super Dry on Tap. I will be back.One last thing, please try their lava cakes

Recommended by friends, decided to choose this place to celebrate my Father in law birthday. We booked for 7, including 3 children. The place was cosy and warm, though nothing to shout about but it is inviting. But whats to talk about with the mouth full, is the food. We ordered starters and soups and 3 mains and 2 risotto. The statement is this; "Every dish is cooked fresh in house and with heart". Ingredient are fresh and honest, portion are generous and hearty. The kids down the porcini risotto and carbonara risotto. They were cooked al dente and robust flavor. The meats were well sought out, lamb were thick and tender, steaks were quality stuff done in right way. Do ask the kind of sauces they have. Grill squid starters is a standing order, they were perfectly grilled tender with good robust olive oil based seasoning. The seafood soup is out of the usual world of soup, I would describe as a good bisque with a touch of heat, a splash of tomatoes, and filled with fresh seafood treasures. We ended with lava cakes; two flavors, black sesame and pistachio cream. Both great competitor against the chocolate. Overall it is the honest food with honest ingredient they could sources, prices are reasonable with this quality and quantity (generous). Service is above average, Jake the host/owner would love to chat...Highly recommended, I enjoyed it, kids enjoyed it, my FIL grateful and full... Do try.

This is a little Italian restaurant in a shop house. Service is great and food is yummy. Opened by celebrity chef, Peter Neo. Lots of photos of local celebrities took up almost one entire wall in the restaurant. Everything we ordered was nice. The waffles were impressive but costs $18!Parking woes... only 3 parking lots available in front of the restaurant. Not too ideal for drivers. That's the only setback.

Peter Neo was the former Chef of a joint at Yio Chu Kang. When we visited the place a couple a months ago, he was no more there for quite awhile. Recently, I read the local food review and wasn't sure if he is the same Peter Neo. Surprise! When we went to check out 'Blend It Up', he was there.We had a great meal. Cheers....

Headed straight here from Bangkok to try out Peter Neo's new restaurant Blend it up. Ordered the escargot , squid ink risotto, 4 cheese pizza, the whole French roasted chicken, baby back ribs and truffles ravioli. The squid ink wasn't on the menu but PETER made it for us. Great food and tastes remained the same. We lapped up all the plates clean; imagined the four of us finishing these dishes on top of the crispy bread and special sauce. Complete the meal with salted egg lava cake and Italian ice cream. Check this place out in paya lebar, a suburban part of Singapore. We'll be back for sure.
