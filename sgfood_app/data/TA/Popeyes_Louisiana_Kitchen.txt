It is always a personal preference when it comes to fried chicken. Popeyes does it for me! :) Automated service machines are hassle-free and food preparation time is short. Love their muffin/scone too.

No KFC for me so Popeyes will be my choice if i really craving for fried chicken. Tasted quite good.

Whenever I see Popeyes in my travels, I make sure I get their yummy biscuit! Its always worth the long lines :)

Happened to be in this area and a bit hungry; discovered this Popeye's on the first level of this Square 2 small mall. Popeye's is known for its (from Louisiana/USA) cajun-style cooking of its fried chicken - you can order mild or spicy versions. Surprising was the total electronic ordering system - something they don't have at the Popeye's in the USA yet. You order yourself from touchscreens (they have an attendant there to help you if needed) and then pay at the counter. Chicken very tasty, just like in the USA
