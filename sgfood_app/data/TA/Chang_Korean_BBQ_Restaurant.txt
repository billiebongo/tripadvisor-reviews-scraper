For how much each dish cost, the food was very mediocre. The side dishes were not up to standard compared with many other Korean restaurants and we had to keep requesting if we wanted a refill. For starters, the kimchi pancake had a generous amount of seafood but was wet and undercooked apart from the edges. My sister had the japchae which was so salty she could not even finish three-quarters of it. For the mains, the spicy soft tofu stew was spicy but bland. The beef broth noodles tasted nothing of beef and more like watered-down anchovy stock. For a dish with nothing but average noodles, a little vegetable and bland soup costing $16, it would have been more satisfying having noodles at the food court. The rice in the raw beef bimbibap was mashy and the beef had an odd taste. The marinated pork was decent. The beef was nothing worth mentioning about. One male service staff was very helpful in providing me with a wet tissue when he saw that I needed it. Rest of the service was generally alright. However, the female Korean manager manning the reception was not polite at all and did not make us feel welcomed. We spent a total of $225 for five and felt that the only thing worth paying for was the barley tea

The place is less airy and the atmosphere more downbeat compared to the old location. Food also seems less special. Our kimchi tofu soup is not so potent, the pajeon too soggy, and the kalbi gui less oozing with flavours (a bit disappointing since they use good-quality meats). Still, one of the better Korean BBQ joints in Singapore - one of the few using charcoal fires. They also charge higher prices, so itâ€™s good but not necessarily good value

The food is amazing. We were not disappointed by the quality and flavours of all prepared and prepared dishes.The surroundings and private room was ok but nothing special.. One point is it gets quite hot by the burners in the private rooms so dress lightly or get them to crank up the AC

As a Korean American I came to Singapore surprised at the boom of Korean places here. I've tried several and usually left somewhat disappointed. Chang's is authentic and the BBQ experience is good. A lot of non Koreans seem curious to try this style of dining when they see it on the k dramas. The staff will grill the meat for you here though. The fire can be intimidating for those that aren't used to it. It was a fun experience for my Singaporean in laws. We tried several different dishes and all were good. Must try!

I love Korean food. I have tried Korean food when I visited Korea & tried a few Korean restaurants in Singapore. Chang is still my favorite Korean restaurant. The ambience is pleasant & not smoky compared to many others Korean BBQ restaurants in Singapore. This is very important to me as I never liked to smell like a BBQ meat after my meal.

Went for dinner there last Fri and the place was quite crowded. Our group of 7 found most of their food items bland except for the barbecued beef. The restaurant was also hot and stuffy and the waitress barbecued our stuff at an express rate! Maybe they wanted to clear us out asap so that they can have another round of seating! Anyway we were done within an hour. Paid almost $600 (no liquor, just plain water) which was simply not worth it for the quality of food, service, ambiance and comfort! Many much better (and cheaper) restaurants around the area and other parts of Singapore

Went to this restaurant for dinner last night. I have been to the restaurant previously, but they just changed location recently. The address is incorrect in this listing and whilst in the same Dempsey complex they are now relocated at 71 Loewen Road.It looked like a Korean fast food restaurant previously, but now it has become distinctly a more upmarket classy restaurant. It stands in a grand building. The selection of food is interesting. This is essentially a Korean barbecue restaurant , and therefore one wonders why bulgogi is not on the menu. After all this is the mainstay of Korean barbecue foods. Had the raw minced beef for starters - delicious.I enjoyed a selection of various cuts of beef and pork which were cooked by a waiter for me. Unusually most of the meats were unmarinated - strange for Korean food. Enjoyed the food, even though it didn't taste that authentic - I've lived in Korea for 6 years so I'm familiar with what's on offer there. Bill was $150 for starters and main with a few beers. Waiters very pleasant and talkative. Great complimentary 5G wifi. Receptionist good in calling for taxi when I was leaving.Toilets are very grand in the restaurant and worth a visit. Overall nice food even if not particularly authentic. Price a little expensive.

Went there to celebrate my brother's birthday. We ordered the kurobuta pork belly, beef prime ribs, chap chay, seafood pancake, ginseng chicken soup and kimchi toufu soup. The Korean are generally known for their appetizers like kimchi, pickled white radish, etc but the appetizers served were only average and limited variety compared to some other Korean restaurants that we have been to. The kimchi toufu soup was good, the ginseng chicken soup was bland. The chap chay was overcooked and soggy, but the seafood pancake was good. The 2 BBQ meat dishes we ordered were only average and the portions were small for the price we paid. Overall the meal costs us $200+ for a party of 5. The service was below average as we need to prompt the staff to top up our tea and were they didn't even bother to smile. Lastly, most other restaurants will offer to apportion the food like soup and chap chay but the staff here just put the dishes on the table and quickly scrambled away. The best things about this place is the ventilation. Miraculously we didn't smell of BBQ after the meal.
3
Went on a sunday evening with no reservation & got a table easily. Service staff was prompt & recommended us their popular boneless rib, prime rib, kurobuto belly etc. The charcoal stove adds flavour to the bbq meat & the staff stay around to cook for you. The meat portion was small & the quality not outstanding as expected for the price charged. The number of side dishes were fewer than expected too. Rice is charged at S $3/bowl. The complimentary pumpkin tea at the end of the meal is sweet & refreshing. Pity one does not feel value for money. Otherwise this is a good venue for regular korean bbq hang out as this is one of the few places which has good ventilation & you do not leave smelling of bbq. It would also help if the Korean Manageress is less icy & more friendly. A smile wouldn't hurt, isn't it
2
Not worth the price to dine at this place with sub standard offerings & a Korean manageress with less then desirable attitude.Dinner, we walked in with no reservations so tried our luck.1st encounter was the Korean manageress who gave us the impression that she was doing us a favour by giving us a table. Should have trusted our instincts & walked off.Anyway we were seated & the wait staff were pretty friendly & helpful.Food was decent but not really worth it's price.For an outlet with premium pricing, the side dishes should have more varieties with better quality.Accompaniments for the BBQ meats lacked variety too. The Korean manageress was the worst, she lacked warmth, when you ask her for things you get the impression she's doing you a great favour, with attitude like this this she shouldn't work the frontline.Not worth visiting as there are plenty better Korean restaurants worth going to at this price point.I gave it 2 points instead of 1 because the waitstaff provided decent service
4
Normally i frown upon Korean BBQ place as i walked out smelling like one. However, this place feels well spaced out and good ambience too.
5
Known for great Korean BBQ, Chang's also offers up other classic Korean dishes! Try the soft tofu soup (sundubu) or the spicy pork ! They have a wonderful fish dish and cold noodle bowls too! All in all a great Korean restaurant with friendly staff!
4
Happen to drive by, and decided to drop by for dinner. Food is good, looking forward to come back and try their Wagyu beef. Service was great and friendly. Places can get rather busy. They did a great salad which is refreshing!
2
Staff were lovely and responsive, venue is pretty and inviting outside. Inside is a bit bland. That's the good stuff. The bad- First they brought the wrong meat, then there is only a tiny amount of the wrong meat (which they didn't replace with what we ordered after I told them it was wrong) and that's it, the meat was really fatty (nice flavour though) then they charged $100 for my 12 year old and me for one soft drink and not much food. Went away hungry and unimpressed. Won't be back.
4
Very authentic Korean restaurant in a beautiful setting. The location changed to 71 Lowen Road but food is still very good. One piece of advice to the owners, I think your pricing is a bit too high. Especially the drinks 8 dollars for a green tea? This should be less if not free.
5
We came for a Tuesday lunch. Damsey Hill is a very nice place to enjoy a meal outdoor. The restaurant seems famous with Charcoal BBQ but as it was a week day lunch, we just chose a light meal as Hot Stone Fish Roe Bibimbap amf Spicy Buckwheat Cold Noodle...and it was fantastic with a very authentic taste, came along with complimentary kim-chi, water and pumpkin drink as a dessert, just as Korean spirit. We really enjoy our lunch time here and strongly recommend it for nature loving people !

Chang Korean BBQ is located at Loewen Road, somewhere near Dempsey Hill. The ala carte stews are always good especially the sundubu stew. The BBQ wasn't as nice as expected, in fact it wasn't quite enjoyable because either the staff overcooked the meat, or it originally tasted that hard... Was kinda shock when the Korean lady from the counter came and said we're not ordering enough because one person did not turn up for our reservation. That's quite appalling... She sounded like she's trying to chase us away yet the restaurant wasn't even full that night. Quite a disappointing dining experience this time. In the end, five of us spent $200 on this very simple meal....
4
5 diners for a Sunday evening meal. Presentation of bbq meats was excellent, they change bbq surface each time for a different type of meat. Appetisers caters to local taste but enjoyable. Really liked the soups, spicy Beancurd n beef stew. Beef so tender. Jap Chye n pancake tasty. Yes, despite Korean ownership, the food is catered to local tastes, too much sauce. However, the attention to detail is really good. Ice cold hite beer is great n love the persimmon drink for dessert. True, own a bbq n u can do better but this is much less messy.
4
Choice of do it yourself on Korean BBQ table or have it delivered to you. We chose diy but the meat was barbecued for us at our table. portions large, prices on high side but truly great. We were three adults and one youngster and with three beers the lunchtime cost was a little more than 200 dollars, so it was pricey. We had three sets plus one extra noodles which was a bit too muck. Much of the food was quite spicy, the noodles were cold which was a surprise. We will go again
3
First be prepared as this is more of the more expensive Korean BBQ restaurants in town (frequented by Korean businessmen) so don't expect to come here on the cheap. Typical selection of beef (wagyu, australian etc) They also have chicken and seafood (as well as vegies) for those that dont want to eat beef. They have since moved from the original outlet down the road in the dempsey area still - bigger place and they have private rooms etc
2
For the price that they charge, it simply does not match the quality of food, drink and (especially) service. My experience with a couple of surly wait staff was what broke the camel's back. Thumbs way down.
5
this is hands down my favourite Korean bbq in Singapore. A must try is the chapche, sea food pancake and ox tang .also the short rib soup !!
3
Had lunch with wife. Food is average at best for such pricing (not cheap). However, service was good. The hotplate is changed out after every round of cooking. That's nice.
5
Great korean food, large choice and good service.
On the bbq the waiters help you out and serve on your plates.
Prices are not the lowest though.
4
We love the BBQ here! One restaurant where we can have BBQ in great comfort. The staff is well trained and takes pride in serving.

Visited this restaurant on 6 Jul 2016.Restaurant shifted to Blk 71, Loewen Road, Singapore 248847. It's still within Dempsey Hill.Nice cosy environment. Helpful friendly waiters and waitresses. Tasty bbq set menu at S$39 pee person (minimum 2 persons). BBQ beef is tender, tastefully good.Really enjoyed. Will visit again

Just opened at a new location nearby in Loewen so call to get the new address. The place is nice but noisy if crowded. The starter pickles were tasty and our favourite was the strips of cuttlefish. The kimchi omelette and the spring onion omelette were great. Kimchi stew is recommended but only for Bravehearts who love spicy food. The meats for barbecue are prime cut and delectable. Our favourites were the Wagyu, beef brisket and kurobuta collar. The kurobuta pork belly was very fatty and the chicken was somewhat dry. Service was prompt and efficient. The staff do the barbecue at your table so the meats are grilled perfectly. It's not cheap. Cost about $100 per person though we didn't have alcohol or dessert but we did have quite a lot of meats.
2
We love the Korean BBQ and had a few times dinner here. A bad experience happened during our last visit. The waiter urged us to eat our BBQ within half an hour because they close at sharp 10:30pm while we were still enjoying starters and soup. Five minutes after we have topped up our order before kitchen close, as per recommendation by the waiter. Then the manager came to insist that we should grill the meat and eat BBQ as suggested by the waiter. The bill with food and wine was $590. We finally had the food packed for take away and finish our meal at one of the guests' place.The restaurant should have warned us at the moment of booking that they close at 10:30p even on Saturday night. We could have then simply avoid such disappointing dining experience among friends. I recommend the restaurant for its food but better double-check their opening time.

With a special family guest from Brisbane here with us, we visited Changs restaurant at Dempsey.You know the restaurant needs paint and some money to refresh inside but the food is fresh quick and so delicious.Korean BBQ and bulgogi, bibimbap and leak pancakes was our chosen fare and all 5 of us thought it was really greatMeal was about $220 for 5 people with drinks and complimentary desert.We be been to Changs several times now and will certainly be back
2
My son and I have been regular customers since Chang Korean BBQ Restaurant opened at Demsey however, I have decided that I will hunt others going forward. It's simply not worth the money I paid for when the waiter was only interested to throw all the meat we ordered onto the grill immediately without asking if we would like it slower. Not that it's cheap. For both of us, we spent $200+ just to get out within 50 mins because all the assorted meat we ordered + additional order of chicken was consumed with such speed. Then I saw at another table the same thing happening and this time, it was some Caucasians. They also stopped the waiter (different waiters) from doing the same. We cannot swallow the meat in such speed and having cooked all, we have to eat them till they grow cold. This is not the type of Korean BBQ "restaurant" I know, it's more of a fast food restaurant now. Lousy Lousy Lousy. My suggestion is that if the waiters are not free, they should ask if the customers would like to BBQ the food themselves which my son and I started to do but they just wanted to come over the cook the meat for us. We don't want that but they just come again.For about the same price I paid for at the Smoke House, we

Well, Koreans eat here too. It's that authentic. You can order simple dishes that doesn't break the bank like noodles, rice with some sides. The meat is not bad but quite expensive.
1
Food was way overpriced and fell way below expectations. Close to $700 for 4 plates of meat that wasn't that great. The free flow kimchi was the only saving grace.
4
I love korean BBq and have to say that this restaurant is one of the best.. Love kimchi, beef marinated or not, all is good there..good place to go with family and to enjoy with a good sake
4
One of the to-go place whenever my husband and I crave korean BBQ. Good service, nice setting and I love the seafood toufu soup!
1
It was still ok that they charge around $50 for 200 grams of beef and $30 for 200 grams of pork, because the marination was quite good. What irks me was the main lady in charge dressed in white came to reprimand us that since we booked for 7 people and only 6 turned up, they have lost the chance of having 1 more customer! I did a booking over the phone for 7 pax. I did not ask for a room or private corner. When 5 of us arrived first, we were led to one of the rooms for an 8-seater, and that main staff did not confirm with us whether we are still 7 pax or now down to 5. After 1.5 hours of eating she came to ask if the other 2 guests are coming and we replied that 1 is on the way and the other couldn't make it last minute. she started telling us about how this 8-seater could sit potentially 10 pax and they lost the chance for more customers blah blah. As a host I felt so embarrassed that this shop was more concerned about its revenue than the enjoyment of the customer. We were big eaters and ordered 5 meats and 2 others so from profit wise I don't see how they lost revenue. From a service wise, they should really reflect on their accusative attitude, pinning the blame on customers when guest don't turn up when we did NOT request for rooms

This is a Korean restaurant located at Dempsey. They are located in the same block as, and is locate directly behind Huber’s Butchery. I have driven past this restaurant several times, and I popped it recently for lunch. Its hot, and the air-conditioned restaurant is a welcome respite from the heat outside. They also have an outdoor alfresco area, which will be good for evenings, to have BBQ while enjoying the evening breeze and watching the world go by. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Preserved kimchi stew with pork: This is a soupy stew, which is made with aged kimchi. Aged kimchi is more mellow and a deeper flavour which is present in the soup. Younger kimchi which is usually served as a side dish is crunchier and sharper taste. The soup tastes good and I went for second helpings. The ingredients – tofu, pork and kimchi were good. - Sashimi Salad: This is special, where fresh beef is cut into strips. This dish also had pear cut into strips. It looked like radish. Its topped with an egg yolk tableside and the manager mixed all the ingredients together. The first taste was ‘wow’. Its really tasty and yummy. The beef has to be really fresh for it to be served raw. Recommended for beef lovers and those who like something unique! - Pumpkin with beef bulgogi: This was unique. The beef bulgogi was cooked and placed into a whole pumpkin. At the table side, the pumpkin was cut into quarters and it resembled an open flower. Beef is well marinated and cooked and goes perfectly with the pumpkin. Lovely. It’s a good first outing to this restaurant, and I will be back again to try out their grilled meats next time. Best thing about the restaurant is that parking is free, which is rare in Singapore

Marinated beef and pork slices can be thinner. Pork was not as tasty. Kimchi and seafood pancake was soft and surprisingly mushy - not something I fancied. Fried ginseng was interestingly yummy and the ginseng chicken soup was delicious. Server was fantastic and attentive - did an excellent job cooking the meats

As my friend always says, "you wanna eat korean bbq? order beef" unless of course, you're in Jeju - then you order black pork. The 2 of us drove around Dempsey Hill a few times until we finally settled on Chang. Decor isn't exactly the most impressive, brown all over but it smelt like a bbq place. After some quick deliberation, we decided on marinated beef, pork shoulder and pajeon (pancake). Banchan (side dishes) lined up our table - about 10 options - max 1 refill unlike in Korea (and some places in Malaysia) whereby you can order unlimited refills. Waiter brought the hot coals and got down to bbq business with the beef. Wrapped in lettuce with a dollop of ssamjeong, I was a happy diner. They gave plenty of lettuce leaves but only 1 stick each of cucumber, carrot and 1 green chilli for 2 diners. Hmm - do the math. Beef was yummy, pork was ok. Pajoen was loaded with spring onions, not oily too. The icy cold after-dinner drink was a welcoming change. Funnily they don't give wet towels to wipe hands before & after meals. Price-wise - pretty steep at SGD120 for 2 of us with no soft drinks or alcohol
4
Overall, the service was terrific and the hostess was warm and accommodating, so that made the visit worthwhile. Food wise, the sides were hit or miss, and the meat was OK, nothing special. it was OK, and not memorable. What I struggled with is other people's rave reviews about the food and atmosphere ... from an atmosphere perspective, its pretty dull with no personality. But again, we left having enjoyed our meal, but felt our wallets took a bigger hit than value we got. Unsure we would come back
5
We had a great time at restaurant. The staff were extremely friendly and really looked after us. The BBQ beef was excellent along with the Korean side dishes .....slowly but surely converting my wife to kimchee! Recommend the beef in pumpkin soup. The flip side of the coin is that this was one of the most expensive meals we have had in Singapore to date....$400 dollars for four people that said you must try the Korean Raspberry Wine and Soju.We will visit again
5
just very authentic, very original Korean food. the only thing that i noticed was that the prices were bait high for the type of food they are serving.. i mean the atmosphere and the service is great... but again, just looking at the bill at the end of the night, with the alcohol.. it could give someone with a sensitive heart an attack!! 5/1

Chang's appears to be one of Koreans' favorite restaurants in Singapore, and for good reason. Food is quite authentic, and the restaurant is full of Koreans - both staff and customers, always a good sign. We ordered kalbi and and Korean fatty bacon, along with it all comes with (the usual Korean sides). It could have easily been downtown Seoul. The wait staff was very attentive, very helpful. This is on the Dempsey Road corridor of restaurants, so a bit out of the way - but well worth the journey. A bit pricey, though - roughly US$150 for dinner for four. We rushed through a Sunday family lunch but it might be better for a weekend dinner when you have time for multiple servings, Korean beer/soju, you name it. If you need Korean food in Singapore, go for this one - just make sure you figure out your transportation in advance if you're not driving
4
We went here the other night with some friends. Layout and setting was very good for having great social dinner. TFood was solid for Korean BBQ, we had some chicken and a few different cuts of beef. All of which were solidly good. Service was decent, nothing stood out for good or bad on it.Price was to be expected for being in Singapore at Dempsey (meaning higher then what use to in other countries but it is what is
5
The manager Jenny (Jung Jung Rey) runs a fabulous restaurant. I understand it has been under new management for 9 months or so. The food is very authentic and the service is extremely good. Very unlike Singapore service! I have visited half a dozen times in the past 6 months and we will continue to return. Great location too.

Over the years, we've never experienced a bad meal at Chang, but we've never had any memorable dish either. We've had great pajeon (spring onion pancakes), soups, bibimbap, even nangmyon (cold noodles) at some Korean restaurants in Seoul or the US - the versions here are all OK-to-good, but nothing special. The soups are particularly disappointing, given how addictive some Korean soups can be. If you come to Chang, it's for the BBQ. Here, it's done with charcoal (most Korean restaurants do it on gas grills), so the meat is flavorful. However, you should ask the waiters to slow down, as they tend to grill the meat far too quickly; you hardly have the time to finish a bottle of soju! The dÃ©cor is simple and elegant, with private rooms and sit-on-floor dining areas, so lots of Korean patrons - corporate entertainment and families eating out - a good sign. Incidentally, Chang Korean BBQ is located next to Shang Antiques shop, but doesn't serve Beer Chang ;
4
Two of us ate here on Saturday night when we had a Korean barbeque craving. We were not disappointed. The cuts of meat were good, the kitchen spot on and the crowd boisterous. They could do with more staff (an ongoing issue in Singapore these days) but it did feel a bit like being in Seoul. We will be going back.
4
Visited Chang on a weekday and had a quite satisfying dinner. There weren't many choices on the menu and if you don't eat beef, you only have very limited food choices. The bbq marinated pork was delicious, their boneless rib was just average. Service wise was average for a weekday. We did have privacy while enjoying our dinner. Pumpkin tea was served at the end of our dinner and I enjoyed it very much.If you are looking for a nice ambience to have dinner on a weekday night, tgis would be a nice place to visit, however just a note, there aren't many choices if you don't eat beef

Requested by a friend to try it out. First of all, must give credit to the good service. Fast, efficient, and polite waiters. They were swift in taking orders and cooking the food for us. There are two well dressed Koreans, whom I presumed to be the owners, are walking around waitering on the customers. Plus it's clean, spacious and nice ambience, I give it thumbs up for environment, good for gathering with friends and family. However, Chang lack on the food quality and pricing. My friends and I ordered seafood and spring oinion pancake, seafood tofu soup, spicy beef soup, waygu BBQ meat set at $128 a set plus collar beef. The soup is ok, not great, lack depth and richness. The pancake is not good, not crispy and can't really say its seafood pancake when you can't see it easily when served. Had better ones at other places like 2day1night. BBQ meat was ok, quality is not worth the price. Also, it's waygu, can't go wrong no matter how you BBQ it, so no credit to CHANG in this area. CHANG uses charcoal for the BBQ, which is a plus point. Overall, better off ordering other meat for BBQ than wagyu set, at least you will feel satisfied than I have after the meal. I was planning for pork knuckle from October fest next door. Also I had a Hite beer at $10 per bottle. Pricy pricy. Average overall experience as I am in mood for food
2
I went to Chang for a family lunch on sunday. the food was good but the service was lousy. Not enought waitings staff. The poor filipino bloke who served us was doing three tables of oer 45 people. I came away thinking that I wasnt satisfied and it was all bit noisy and not fun.The amazing thing was the restaurant was half full.And only one Korean person, in site.Not impressed
4
This is my third or fourth time coming here for dinner. first time i came, their service was good and food very delicious. so i decided to go again when i free. The food look fresh and taste good, i like their black pork meat & their beancurd soup as well. yummy. The service were good although the food are expensive, once in awhile went there still not so bad. from the experience i had, i suggest if you scare their service not good, try to avoid going during perk period because when they busy with a lot of guests, they will not that alert. i always go slightly early or slightly late dinner with friends, that why most of the time their service to us are good
4
Service is good. Staff is very attentive to customer's need. I finished my sauce and she automatically refill it without me telling. can see koreans around dining. Must try the korean's delicacies, gingseng soup!
4
Food was great, great service, it was very popular and busy with lots of Korean visitors so it must be good.
4
Likes : Wide choice of side dishes, the pajeon, good service.
4
Understated place - good menu and opted for beef BBQ for three people. We were really well looked after. Food excellent. Service excellent. No hesitation going back. Not sure if same service when busy? But overall, price, service, food quality and facilities very good on our visit
4
Of the times that I have been there, there were hardly any crowd. The service was great generally, and I like the staff's helpfulness and alertness if one of our side dishes were depleting, and they would gladly top up more.There was also an option to have your pork grilled outdoors by the waitress while you wait inside. This is to prevent the smell from the grill, and also to beat the heat if you went al fresco.Everytime I'm there, I will order Cold Noodles, or Naengmyun. It is always prepared to perfection and I don't think anywhere else in Singapore will serve Naengmyun of the same standard. Of course, it comes at a price, but it is definitely worth every dollar
2
Was there on a raining Tuesday night without any reservation. The restaurant was only half seated. Well, was seated real fast. But waited for 15mins for the service realise that we were seated without menu. When we were ready to order, we hardly get any attention from the service staff to take our order.Never the less, we continue with our order. We ordered a spicy seafood beancurd soup, it is not spicy, beancurd were all mash up and there are only 2 small prawns in there. The Wagyu Rib Eye was ok. The price we pay for the dinner, we are not impress with the service and the food.Will not recommend and go bad again
5
This is one place that keeps us coming back for more. We have been a number of times and find the staff friendly, efficient and the food is always fresh and delicious. The staff are always happy to accommodate us and have fun personalities while being professional. We opt for the Korean BBQ option with Pork Belly, and usually Chicken or fillet steak. The portion sizes are good to excellent and great value for money. The seafood and spring onion pancake is also a must and with the mouthwatering array of Kimchi, fresh chilli and other sides its a hard decision what to put in your mouth first!Friday and Saturday nights are always busy so phone reservation is a must if you want a reasonable time

After visiting some of the antique and furniture stores on Dempsey road, by husband and I stumbled on to Chang Korean Barbecue restaurant. We weren't sure if we could get a table as walk-ins on a Saturday evening, but the staff was able to accommodate us. Neither of us had ever tried Korean barbecue before, but after tasting a sample of delectable delicacies, it won't be our last time The meat was high quality and the fresh vegetable sides and sauces were also wonderful. The service is quick and efficient, but you do most of the work as you cook the meat to your liking. I was please to note that the restaurant used charcoal for the grill rather than gas, so it was an even nice flavor. The restaurant isn't cheap, but I think comparable to similar places in the area
4
We went to Chang's for dinner. Phone booking was quick, pleasant and efficent. The interior is like a typical Korean restaurant. There are long tables with 2 cooking stations on each, enough room for a group or like with us, 3 separate couples sitting there without feeling like you are encroaching on the other couples.Alcohol pricing was good. Meat prices for the BBQ was typical restaurant pricing. Service was quick, attentive and efficient. It is not the type of restaurant you want to go if you would like a long, lingering romantic dinner. It is a fun BBQ experience. The bonus is they use charcoal for the BBQ rather than gas like in many of the other restaurants. This guarantees a nice BBQ flavour

We were invited by a Korean collegue and her husband to join them for lunch at Chang, Dempsey Hill. Ashamed to say that we have never visited a Korean restaurant so we were really looking forward to the experience with the benefit of the guidance of our Korean hosts. We let our Hosts order, choosing 4 Individual set banquets 2 of 1 set and 2 of the alternative set. Giving us the opportunity to sample more dishes. The restaurant was spaciouse and only about a 1/4 full for this Saturday Lunch time service but still had a good atmosphere. Our waitress was unable to speek Korean to our hosts request for some clarification on the menu which amused us as we had been sold on the "full Korean experience" fortunately her Knowledge and English were both fluent so our host's queries were answered. We had a table full of small hot and cold dishs together with BBQ beef cooked perfectly by our waitress at our table. A lovely seafood and beef "casserole" As absolute novices we enjoyed our banquette but were not sure if this was a authentic representation of Korean food. Our hosts informed us that a lot of the dishs were authentic and in their opinion this was the best Korean restaurant they had visited in the 1 year living in Singapore. Couldn't tell you what the dishes we ordered names were. But we enjoyed them all

When you dine out at Chang Korean BBQ, your focus has to be on good meat and you have to simply accept that the setting and interior of this restaurant is basic. We had a Wagyu beef BBQ and it was fantastic. Excellent beef made on the BBQ was an experience we do not want to miss. Beyond that, not much more to say. "Very functional" waiters and the atmosphere of a waiting room in a railway station

We went many times with family and friends' family. The quality of the beef is really good. We had to order seconds, thirds... to satisfy our picky kiddie eaters. Nice environment and the private rooms work well for family get togethers or corporate entertainings. It's on the expensive side and worth the price from time to time

we got there at 9pm and were told to order right away as the last order was in half hour........by the time our wine arrived within 5 minutes of sitting down...........we were reminded 4 times about placing the order.... which we did immediately........the food was on the table instantly and put on the grill by the waitress....and even in spite of telling the waitress to go easy and give us some time .........she kept on plying the food on the grill ........as a result we had some burnt food and some food which we could not finish as it remained uncooked......since we were informed that the restaurant closes at 10 pm !!!!!!!!!ten minutes before closing most of the staff including our server left for the night.........a manager and one other person were the only ones left.....and they were most interested in getting us out of the restaurant............the restaurant serves Korean BBQ which one has to cook on a grill on ones table......and the meal is very expensive and to expect to be required to finish your meal half an hour after the last order is not a nice thing..then to top it up we asked the manager to get us a taxi and she said the lines were busy after one try and slammed the phone...... and then asked us to wait out side the restaurant and find a taxi !!!!!!!!!!!altogether a unpleasant experience with average food and very bad service.strongly suggest that they change the time of the last order to 8.30 if they must close at 10 pm........so that one can at least relax and enjoy the meal !!
