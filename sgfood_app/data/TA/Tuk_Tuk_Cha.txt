If you are looking for authentic Thai milk tea, it has to be Tuk Tuk Cha. Tried many available Thai milk tea from other restaurant and nothing beats tuk tuk.

The milk tea and milo breads with condensed milk were fantastic. Tea offered didn't taste as good as the ones in Thailand, but you'll get the feel of it.

At Fountain of wealth was looking for a place to see watch the fountain. Saw Tuk Tuk and got a corner seat near the glass wall lovely place, always reach to see this in night when sky is a bit dark

Visit Tuk Tuk Cha store in Bugis Junction. They serve Ice Thai Tea for $3. Value for money and the taste is good. Kids will love it.

Seems like they are testing a new brand - Love Mee or Áà±Èù¢Â≠ê - a good play on the pun in English and Chinese. I had the spicy chicken la mien, which was served cold. Quite authentic taste from China. Maybe the mix of Thai and Sichuan dishes can work

The Thai milk tea with cheese foam at 50% sugar level here is so good and addictive! The cinnamon bits added an extra texture. And you have been warned - the mini noodle tom yam rice noodle bowl at $1.90 consists of one spoonful of rice noodle (yes, you heard it right!) one piece of fish and prawn each!

Tuk Tuk Cha is a little corner cafe located in Novena Velocity sports mall. It's very convenient for a quick bite & drink, but as many place located in malls, it's defo not a place you're willing to spend the whole afternoon in.The hot Thai Milk Tea is delicious and super cheap ; the matcha ice cream is also yummy ; and if you're more into real meals or salty treats, you'll find a selection of noodles, soups and other good options.Service is as kind as a prison gate, but hey& you are in Singapore

The staff are the rudest I ever encountered. They ignore customers, chat with colleaques in Thai, speak Thai to customers. They let a queue of would-be customers build up.They take their time to casually man the counter, all the while chatting with their buddies or eyeing their hand held device. There is absolutley no eye contact or communication with the customer.You place your order, pay your dues, get your receipt, go to the Collection Counter... and wait and wait and wait. If your are lucky, and they are inspired, you get a disc that lights up when your order is ready.Prices are exhorbitantly hight for what you get. Tom Yam Sandwich, consisting of 2 slices of bread waffled together costs $4. Audacious. $1.90 for a mini-noodle that consists of about one swallow of noodle. Try it to believe it.And...Thai hospitality here is as rare as the white elephant. You are expected to clean up after you had dined. You are also expected to clean up your own table if the party before you had left the table uncleared. Enough said

Visited the one in Novena Square for first time, staff there weren't friendly. Most importantly, the tables were mostly wobbly and interior doesn't appear from clean. Food was still stuck to the chopsticks so I had to clean it with wet wipe before using.Tried the tom yam soup noodle, was tasty and spicy enough

This place have authenic thai drinks, they have lemon grass, thai lemon tea, ice thai tea, etc. The drink is del8cious but too much ice is added. I ordered the large cup but still felt that they should add lesser ice as it is not enough to quench my thirst

Forget bubble teas. Forget the Gong Chas or the KOI's of the world. Tuk Tuk Cha ftw. Anyday all day everyday. Perfect thirst quencher for the casual bubble tea lover. No question.

It's the best thai milk tea in city. The price is cheap. They have some light snacks as well. But there is no place to sit around

My friends and I tried the Thai tea and mango sticky rice and we loved it. Pretty similar to the ones we had in Bangkok. Overall, reasonable pricing, nice ambience and good taste.

Great Thai milk tea great desserts place Breakfast here is great too especially for dates next time I'm coming here with someone. Costly? Not really it's pretty affordable üôåüëç

Tuk Tuk Cha @ Raffles City serves the best authentic Thai milk tea on the go. If you miss the taste of Thai Milk Tea or Thai Green Milk tea, this is the place to find. Located at B1
of Raffles City Shopping Centre.

The only downside is the space of the stall. If there were more seating spaces, it would be great! The toast and tea is delicious!

Patronized the store at 313. Nice variations of drink and the fact tt the staff were Thai made the whole kiosk feels more authentic.However, the lady who served me really had an attitude. Hope they can be nice cos I didn't offend her.Order Thai Lemon Tea with less sugar. Not bad.

Came here for afternoon tea and ordered the chocolate n matcha waffles with mango ice cream priced at $9.80. These tasted good and is not overly sweet at all. The drinks are nice too and you can choose the sugar level which is great. We went for 50% sugar which is just nice.

Came into the restaurant to find that the table was full of leftovers. When we asked the staff to help clean up the table, the staff rudely pointed to the cleaning cloth and told us to clean it up ourselves. We understand that they have a self cleaning system and we should clean up after we are done (which we did). But if other customers fail to, the staff should not rudely shift that responsibility to new customers. Food would just taste really bad afterwards.

Highly recommended the toast if you can't travel all the way to Bangkok. Thai milk tea is also great and not as sweet as original. Downside is this stall doesn't have any table for sit down and can only do take-away. The milo condense milk toast is something different from After You in bkk.
