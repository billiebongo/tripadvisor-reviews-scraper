Chicken had a smoky taste which I love! Great food! It would be best if the meat itself have the sauce.

Expecting Lenas to be a different restaurant but it is the same as MOF Japanese restaurant. Like the range of food in menu. Disappointed that chawanmushi ran out at 7.40 pm.

We Visited the restaurant on Christmas Day. It was Not so crowded unexpectedly. The platter including the fish and prawns are a bit cold but the ribs are great.

Went in the afternoon and had the lunch set deal which was rather worth it as it came with a drink, garden salad and soft serve ice cream. However, the female staff had such a sucky attitude. The experience would have been made better if not for her.

Reach there and was direct to our seats after telling them we make a reservation. Food too a while as it was dinner time and restaurant was packed. Food quality was good. Payment was fast and with Safra card you enjoy 10% discount on top of the prepaid Chop voucher purchased.
