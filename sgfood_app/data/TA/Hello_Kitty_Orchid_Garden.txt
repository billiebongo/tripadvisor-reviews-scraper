little girls would love this place, for all the hello kitty decorations and the food in hello kitty shapes! this place is also great for the gram ;)
3
The service and experience was very good. Food was average. The service definitely impressed me more than the food.
3
The place has a very nice and quiet ambience. I personally love the pretty greenery look of the cafe. The food and drinks are on the pricey side, and taste alright.
3
Its a good place for kitty lovers and to chill. With some nice decor for photo takings. Maybe recommend.
4
Nice ambience and food are not too bad.. but its kinda slightly overprice for a handful of the menu...the pizza is something unique and yumeh...
4
The place was peaceful and pretty on its own decorations. The food was nice, considering it being a theme cafe. But the price may be a little on the high side. Overall was still acceptable and dessert was good.

IF you're a fan of Hello Kitty (like myself) this place is worth the visit for the cute interior and Insta worthy shots but nothing more!!! Food tasted awful and is overpriced for what you get. My food tasted like it had been left out for a while, and then simply reheated in the microwave. Not fresh at all and tasted worse than aeroplane food. I would go simply for a coffee if you're planning on going here to get those cute Instagram shots
4
I liked the ambience! If one is a Hello Kitty fan, it is worth a visit. We did not have high expectation on the food as this is a theme cafe. However, it turned out that we had good experience and felt very satisfied with our dinner. However, I felt the charges are a bit pricey.I don't mind to patronize the cafe again.

Courteous service at kid friendly restaurant. Decor was carefully designed to showcase Singapore’s beautiful Orchid! We ordered afternoon tea promo (weekday) for two at $18, which included two hand crafted beverages, a piece of cake, and a frozen yogurt with one fruit topping of choice. It’s a great place to take loads of photos for Hello Kitty fan like me
3
Quite a simple experience while admiring the deco and ambience. Nothing spectacular. As for the food wise, taste delicious but portion not for those who has a big appetite as the serving is just nice for a small stomach. Presentation of food quite interesting. Friendly staffs and good service. Whenever you happened to patronage Changi Terminal 3, you may want to give a try. Their desserts are pretty cute!
4
nice ambiance. Great place to chit chat and relax. We have signed up a membership with them so that we can enjoy 20% discount on all our subsequent visits.
5
Excellent service at cafe! Like the warm smiles of the staff there which made celebrating our 2-yr-old's birthday fun and relax! We had a complimentary frozen yoghurt too!

Nice and Friendly Staff
Nice and amazying delicious food
Clean and comfortable dining place
Excellent choice !!!
5
Food taste excellent. Portion just nice. Service was friendly and good. Very helpful service staff especially when you’re dining with young kids. Well done!!!
3
Environment is good. The location was easy to find and the food make as Hello Kitty zhape but the taste of food is ok only
5
Very happy that reservations can now be made via Chope. Brunch items and drinks that we ordered were quite alright.
4
Food are ok, not too bad. Had curry , fish, and beef. Not very big place but there’s plenty of seats on a weekend. Recommended for kitty fans.
3
The restaurant is small. The portion of food also small. May be they just want to attract 'small' customer...
5
Great place for a hello kitty lover!!!! The decoration and the environment are really beautiful. The food is very nice and the food presentation is really awesome.

Visited Hello Kitty Orchid Garden 2 weeks ago at Changi Airport Terminal 3. As this cafe was opened in May 2016, there were no queue and plenty of empty tables. However, no one was there to serve us and thus we walked in on our own and found a table to seat. We went in for dessert and ordered the Kitty Goes Banana Split. Mixture of brûléed banana with brown sugar, accompanied with Macarons and juicy berries, with 3 scoops of gelato and a drizzle of marshmallow sauce and raspberry coulis with costs $18.50. Wow! The price is actually reasonable as there are 3 macarons, 3 scoops of gelato, berries and banana. I enjoyed the macarons but the gelato were served in a small scoop, with the 3 flavors - Vanilla, Chocolate and Strawberry. Portion is not very big and not very small. Highly recommend this dessert. Let's move on to the beverages.We ordered a cup of latte (S$5.90) with a latte art of Hello Kitty and the Peach Sunrise (S$7.90) the latte was average but the Peach Sunrise was superb. In love with the drink. Surrounded by pretty orchid flowers to dine in.
3
Reservation went smooth.
Kitty restaurant staff are friendly towards the 2 toddlers n prepare baby chairs and drawing kits for them to draw.
Kitty food presentation is awesome but the taste is only average.
3
Had family lunch for my babies birthday. Service is good but food is lacking in terms of taste. Hence, does not feel is value for money. Atmosphere is lacking as compared to the version in Taiwan.
3
Review by Dr Sim. Service is good. Food is expensive. Good for a novelty outing. Great for Hello Kitty Fans. Tourists interested in Hello Kitty should drop in for a drink or cakes. Regards Dr Sim
2
Atmosphere quite nice.
Staff Attitude not really friendly. (He speak very soft and don't seem to smile )
4
This restaurant amuses kids very much. I am happy with the atmosphere mostly because my girl enjoyed the stay. The kid's meal and main course was ok in my opinion but the dessert was great.The service could be better. Maybe only one staff is slightly better than average. The rest seems like serving just because it's a job. I wish to see service from the heart.

Hello Kitty Orchard Cafe is just outside arrivals hall at Changi Airport. It is a themed cafe with all things Hello Kitty, the seats, tables, decorations and food. They are open 24 hours and have a different menu over the late hours of the evening. I have been before and had regular lunch food but as I was there at 4 am this time, I had the restricted menu which is mostly coffee and cakes. I had a coffee, complete with my hello kitty art and a cute cookie! I loved it. Be sure to visit if you're a hello kitty fan!
4
I was taking a flight home and my family and friends wanted to check out the place. So off we went.Firstly the restaurant/store is super cute and will be a hit with small and big kid. You know who you are...We ordered the tea set which comes with two coffees/teas, a slice of any cake and frozen yogurt with one topping. For S&18 it's a pretty good deal. I ordered the Staying Afloat ice cream sundae in a cup. All in all it was too much food for 3 adults but it was fun eating it. I expect to be served supper on the flight I was taking but decided to continue eating.A fun place to get something to eat though it is a little more expensive than other places at the airport. One thing it is located on floor 1 of terminal 3
4
Visited the cute Hello Kitty Theme Cafe for Lunch and Mini Birthday celebration. Ordered 2 kids meal (cheese macoroni and egg-licious). Rendang Chicken and a chicken wrap.Food potion was good, and taste great.Ordered a slice of cake, upon inform the staff that is for birthday, the staff nicely present it with candle and a soft serve yogurt. Good place to visi
4
The cafÃ© was small as compared to Korea/BKK. Food varieties were few but luckily, the food were up to standard. Despite the food being yummy, portion was very small. We somehow felt full but not entirely full. There also wasn't a lot of areas to take photos also. When it got crowded, I believe it would be tough to take photos. My personal opinion: Go during off peak hours and going once would be enough in the short run
3
Had breakfast at this place. The cafe looks very attractive with beautiful arrangements of Orchids and the menu too make interest and food presentation was excellent, but the level of service needs to be more improved as the staff need to give more focus on guests. They all looked worried and stressful and hardly smile. Never engaged with me or any of the other guests. Very average service compared to Singapore standards. Will I go again? May be not
3
Price abit more expensive,but the staff very friendly and patient,food is not bad.Place too small also .
4
Food served has decent but overpriced. Paid a premium for the novelty that is Hello Kitty. Place had spots for fans wanting to take nice pictures. Family friendly and easily accessible as well.
4
The decoration is very closely related to Hello Kitty, the staff are professional enough. But since everything relates to Hello Kitty, so are the prices... So, this restaurant is for those who are considered "well-off".
4
I think all Hello Kitty's fans will love this place.The food is better than I've expected. The spaghetti is quite nice.The down side is the place is a bit small. The cafe is just beside the arrival immigration, you can have a good view of the people collecting the luggage. This will be a good place to chill out while waiting for people touching down.Strongly recommended to use the Chomp app to make reservations and earn some Chomp dollars 
3
I arrived from Phuket and wife bring my kids to go and fetch me so we decided to try it out cos we haven't visit since it open as there is a always long q.You will like it if you are a Hello Kitty Fans and kids will like it too but not me. The food is decent and taste not too bad but the price is abit overprice maybe due to the rental cost in singapore and it's located in Changi Airport. Don't think will go back again for the 2nd time
5
Looks like a beautiful flowers garden. Wished there were more spots to take hello kitty photos. There were 2 main hello kitty statues which are almost life size for kids. Food was reasonably delicious. But not much in terms of the hello kitty theme in the food presentation. Overall very nice outing for the kids!
2
Well while its cute and fun to dine in hello kitty with its kitchy decor, the food was so so but very expensive considering the quality one is paying. Try once only if there is no queue or if there is nothing better to eat. If not, wont be back if its so pricey
4
Visited the cafe during Saturday peak hour and the cafe was packed. The cafe manager was quick to offer assistance and gave us the only swing seats available in the cafe. Having our meals on the swing seat was really an unique experience, but as my daughter was with us, it is rather difficult to feed her while seated on a swinging seat. In addition, the plates for the foods were rather large and the round table is definitely too small for 2 pax foods. We ordered the Seafood Chowder, Mushroom Spaghetti and Watermelo Sparkling Cocktail drink. The seafood chowder was thick and rich taste and the Spaghetti was cooked Al Dente. Watermelon Cocktail is definitely a must-try item.In terms of pricing, it is cheap considering that it is a theme cafe
4
First time going with my cousin in Singapore. After arriving we went and checked out this place. It just opened. Lots of people. Food are good, but a bit pricey...maybe its because its inside the airport. Our server was slow (it was like 2am)...but the food was good

My partner & I returned from a 15D China trip last week, which included Disneyland Shanghai & Dongbei (东北）, China. We experienced nightmarish service at Modern Coffee & Restaurant in Harbin which charged close to ¥400 (approx S$80)for 2 pax <not cheap by China standard as normal mid price range restaurants charge ¥120-160 for 2 pax. If food & service at Modern were good, we didn't mind spending ¥400 for 2 pax just for remembrance sake. Additionally, we also experienced poor service at Les Suites Orient Hotel in Shanghai so much so we were so relieved to be on Singapore Airlines (our flight back home) & now, Hello Kitty Orchid Garden Restaurant back in Singapore. <Our reviews on Modern in Harbin & Les Suites Orient in Shanghai have been published in TA just in case you are planning to go to these two cities, you may wanna read them. >Today (29 May), I was supposed to treat my student for a meal at Hello Kitty Orchid Garden for scoring full marks in her recent exam. Only when we were half-way through our journey to Changi Airport T3, then I remembered I left my handphone charging at home.When we arrived at the restaurant, we were warmly welcomed by Joyce & another male colleague of hers. Both were equally friendly, professional & extremely patient. I thought may be I could ask the waitress for help with the photos when we were looking at the menu. After waitress Joyce helped us with the ordering of our food, I approached her with regards to the photo-taking & she was more than willing to help us, not once, not twice but thrice. First, it was our two plates of food, then the dessert & lastly my student stood next to two life-size Hello Kitty figurines to have her photos taken. Then, she forwarded all the photos to me only after her shift was over. Thumbs up! A responsible staff. <plse read our review of Laobian Dumpling Restaurant in Shenyang-waiter talking on handphone while on duty> We were grateful to Joyce, at least now we have pictures of our first patronage of Hello Kitty Orchid Garden for remembrance. Thank you! Ambience : Don't miss taking a meal here if you are a Hello Kitty fan. Food-wise... hmmm.... could taste better. We had:- Leaning Tower of Kitty, Egg Benedict, yoghurt dessert & apple juice.The look of the food : not bad at all! Price-wise....a little on the high side. But a treat for a very hardworking student, all worth it. Slightly above $50. If quality of food is high on your list, then you may wanna skip this restaurant. But today, I've brought along a kid who enjoyed a meal in that ambience, had pictures taken plus I was hungry for good service after bad experiences in China, thus I've gone ahead with a 5-circle rating, mainly due to quality of service, ambience & looks of our dishes which made us happy.
3
Not a fan of the hello kitty theme, but decent cafe fare at relatively expensive prices. Good service and nice kitschy interior.
4
A Muslim halal certified cafe located at terminal 3, arrival hall, Changi airport. Nice garden theme cafe to chill and take lots of photos. Food and dessert too pretty to eat and a bit pricey.
4
Cool cafe if you're into Hello Kitty and you have no where to go! lol
cakes were yummy and the cutlery were all hello kitty theme
Would I return YES
Rating out of 5: Food: 5. Service: 5 Value: 3.5 Ambience: 5

Cute cafe with amazing design and nice chairs! A little bit pricey but worth it as you get delicious food and cozy atmosphere :)

The Hello Kitty Orchid Garden was located at Changi Airport, Terminal 3 #01-22, 65 Airport Boulevard , Singapore 819663.The surroundings was decorated with H/Kitty posters and beautiful orchids. The environment was cosy and quiet. A good place for a rest and food for visitors before they catches their transfers or transport. The staff crews are friendly and helpful too.There are in-store merchandise for sale too. The biscuits/cookies are worth The menu was quite limited in choice but worth a try. The food was good on the whole.Will visit the place again
3
They have 2 version of their menu, the 'daylight' version and the 'red-eye' version. Their food is nice but definitely overpriced. I tried the "Land of the Rising Kitty" which was pasta with teriyaki chicken, and their pasta was actually really nice, and got the pink soda (i forget the name). The interior is really nice, but it is not a must. Spare 2-3 hours if you're ever got the chance to go to T3 at Changi Airport
5
Not cheap, but fun for all Hello Kitty lovers. Everything is Hello Kitty from the decor to the china to the servers' uniforms. I ate late at night with no wait but it seemed like there could be a wait at popular dining times. All foods have a cute name. "Going for a tan" is Mushroom soup. :) Honestly, evceryhgin about the place will bring a smile to your face. Hello Kitty gifts are sold
3
A very cute place to visit, but the food offering wasn't spectacular.I ordered a Japanese chicken teriyaki dish with spaghetti, it was almost inedible as the spaghetti had so much garlic and chilli powder on it.I didn't have time to have one of the cakes, but they looked divine
3
This cute cafe is located in Arrival Hall, Terminal 3 of Changi Airport. So the moment when you arrive, you can see the cafe from baggage claim. The interior is cute and has a garden feels as its name. I arrive around 2 pm and luckily there was no crowded at all! They serve many variant of food, from breakfast to dessert. A bit pricey, I ordered dessert and the taste was just average. But this place is a must visit for Hello Kitty lovers to enjoy the cuteness and take photos! :
1
We ordered coffee cappuccino and doubled delight, my girl friend ordered float chocolate and we found a hair in the drink. Service is bad 20+ minutes for coffee and drinks cake was super dry and coffee tastes like burnt milk,don't waist your time on this place $$$$ and not good
5
A must visit for Hello Kitty fans. The coffee was ok, the desserts were nice. Didn't try the food although the menu looked substantial. More of a photo opportunity for fans of the cat :)
2
Came here for brunch. The decor is of course cute and nice but there's nothing else beyond that. The meal cost almost SGD50/- but the dishes are really below standard. Totally not worth it and will not patronise again...
2
Food is overpriced and below average. The Hello Kitty theme is also not very cute for the true blue Hello Kitty lovers.
1
Ordered 2 main course, both the curry chicken n beef rendang are super salty. Kitty blush drink nothing special. Place is not big, atmosphere is normal, no Hello kitty feel. Prices are expensive n portion are small. Definitely not worth for a second visit
4
Food presentation was nice and the friendly staff made the overall experience at the restaurant worthwhile.
4
This cafe is not so obvious. It looks ordinary. But it is quite a pleasant place to try this unique theme.
3
2nd time here as requested by the kids. Food was average. Cafe was not very big. Dessert menu has more variety now. One service staff stood out. He's good with the kids and provide good service and recommendation. 2 thumbs up to Param. Hope you continue with your good service and enthusiasm. Thanks and all the best!
3
Came here to explore Hello Kitty Cafe, which everything here is about Kitty. Menu at this time is rather limited and their food serve very fast. Food quality wise is good and you get Kitty logo everywhere, even on the food such as carrot and latte. Service wise is lacking and I still need to take my own child seat and staff are nowhere in sight most of the time. Unless you want to indulge in Kitty, just experience it one-time is more than sufficient
4
Not a Hello Kitty fan but my mum is. So we came here during tea time, ordered a couple of coffees, soup and a desert. I was a little skeptical before I came here, but when I left I was impressed. Though it's pricey just like other themed cafes, the quality of food and drinks were good. Service from this particular guy was exceptional. My mum wanted the Hello Kitty themed plastic spoon used for the desert and when we asked him if we could bring it back, he gave her a new piece instead! You could take a picture with 2 huge Hello Kitties which is sure to excite a fan. And you could also purchase Hello Kitty toys and accessories near the counter

The Hello Kitty Orchid Garden is located at the arrival hall of Changi Airport Terminal 3. Besides drawing inspiration from Singapore’s national flower, the mascot of Hello Kitty Orchid Garden is also unique to Singapore – the only Hello Kitty with 2 bows in the world.Hello Kitty Orchid Garden (Singapore). Basically, I think a guy would be more willing to step into this Hello Kitty Café than any other Hello Kitty Café in the other parts of the world (i.e. not so pink and sweet), the orchids and garden scheme makes it more bearable.However, other than its Hello Kitty undertones and cuteness, there really isn’t much to rave about the food, which is grossly overpriced (if you compare it with the other Hello Kitty Cafés). But still it is good to visit at least once, just for the experience and a chance to indulge in (Hello Kitty) food cuteness and instagram goodness. Leafing through the pages of the menu was a kittifying experience: while the photo illustrations of the food were a bliss to the eyes and the food portions adequate, the pricing was not so kind to the wallet or the eyes. For instance, tortilla chips (9-10 pieces) topped with parmesan, olives, onions, jalapenos, cherry tomato salsa and generous amount of cheese sauce cost S$15.90! The pricing is really a little ridiculous, so much so that I think the Hello Kitty Café in Taipei does a better job with its (more reasonable) pricing.However, as we were only there for the sake of being there experience, we ordered the “Cowabunga! Wagyu!” (S$24), “Land of the Rising Kitty” (S$17.50), and “Opps Kitty did it again” (S$7.90).The “Cowabunga! Wagyu!” is basically wagyu beef that is cooked rendang (local) style with a refreshing pineapple rempah (Nyona spice mix a.k.a. the gravy) that is paired with Japanese rice shaped Kitty-style. For its taste, presentation and portion, this if for you if you want something more substantial, but the price (S$24) is a tad exorbitant just for having beef that is said to be wagyu.“Land of the Rising Kitty” is a dish that consists of chicken and spaghetti, which were nicely presented but nothing kitty about it. Given the portion and the price, I would say that it is more reasonable than the “Cowabunga! Wagyu!”.“Opps Kitty did it again” is actually fries and no, there is also nothing Hello Kitty about this dish, just plain simple good old fries served with chili sauce. The presentation was interesting and the portion for the fries was quite large, but that is what makes it worth it weight I guess. The whole meal cost us S$59.32 (inclusive of 10% service charge and 7% GST). While the portion of the food more or less makes up for the high prices and the taste acceptable, if you are looking for value for money, than the prices are a tad exorbitant (e.g. no set dinners etc...). And if you are looking for a truly Hello Kitty experience, it is a little underwhelming. Conclusion: Other than the orchids that adorn the cafe, nothing really stands out. It is not really Hello Kitty enough (the Hello Kitty Café in Taipei has more kittlicious looking desserts) and the prices are simply pocket-wrenching. The only thing it has going for it is the location and the fact that it is (the only one - for now) which is open 24 hours daily, and its unique Hello Kitty with 2 bows mascot

Low value for money.
Friendly service but below average food quality. Tasteless waffles, and pricey food items.
Coffee bean serves better quality all day breakfast.
Limited choice for children menu.
5
The resturant surrounding is very nice and beautiful , dinner ( spaghetti , chicken ) is very tasty , we order different kinds of food there , all are delious . Dessert also excellent with the taste and design . Will go there again .

A really well run , friendly themed eatery, are you reading Charlie Brown Cafe.
The food was imaginative and fun.
Thank You.

Went to try out the restaurant as heard about it. Nothing fantastic for the food and limited choices in items. I guess the main selling point is the theme of hello kitty.
3
Service was good from the start even though the restaurant was quite busy when we came in. We were seated and there was no rush to order, or when we made the server turn back to take drink orders instead, he just turned around and happily obliged. Drinks, although ordered about 10 minutes before our food, came after most of our food arrived at the table. Later on, main courses came out before the salads as well. Considering that the mains we ordered are dishes that should probably take a little more time to warm up or prepare, it makes you wonder if it's scooped out of a bit pot or if everything has been sitting under a warmer just ready to be lifted onto a plate. Food was well-seasoned, but side salads that came with most dishes didn't have any dressing. Not sure if they didn't expect people to eat them but the portions were so small we actually cleaned every plate and still had room to order another main and dessert
3
In the arrival hall next to baggage area exit, one wonders how kids and Hello Kitty fans could enjoy themes and songs. You wouldn't want passerby starring into the cafe at you as your teeth sinks into a cake or dessert? The effort to setup a Hello Kitty themed cafe is laudable but the location is questionable. Unlike in Tokyo or Taipei where the ambience and music/songs synchronises, here is like decorations and tables compact to fit the space available. I did not see a Kitty waitress as well. Hopefully the weekend family crowd who visits airports as a pastime can sustain the cafe. On weekdays it is pretty empty. Go for kids meal and dessert or buy collectibles like stamp folders. Beyond that, I doubt the tourists would want to pop in a Hello Kitty cafe outside its country of origin.

If you ever find yourself at Singapore’s international terminals at odd hours — say, 3:00 in the morning? It’s a great time to visit one of the newest 24-hour attractions to open in Changi Airport: Hello Kitty Orchid Garden cafe and bistro! Having arrived at an ungodly hour, the kitchen was only serving a limited breakfast and bistro menu — nevertheless, every singe item we ordered was delicious (much better than other theme cafes in the city!). The ice cream sundae alone is worth the $20 cab ride to get from the airport to our flat! So if you have an insomniac friend and maybe a hundred bucks to burn, we highly recommend a late night run for cute and cuddly munchies at Hello Kitty Orchid Garden
3
Although I am not a Hello Kitty fan, I have heard so much about the long queue of 1 to 5 hours when the cafe first opened on May 2016. The place is so prettily done up with the Hello Kitty icons everywhere from decorations, to furniture to food. It will be perfect if the food is made more yummy even though the food selection is limited
4
Nice ambience for all things Hello Kitty. Prices are expensive but it is after all a themed-cafe. We bought the assorted slices of cakes at $8.90 each. Tasted delicious and sweet, of course. Only for those with sweet tooth!Limited menu, so did not try the main course. Can go with children and Hello Kitty fans only
2
Very limited choice of food. Nothing special. I have ordered for "kitty goes fishing" which is salmon fish. Quite oily. The cup served is not clean properly and its with lip stick stain. Deco is average and can't identify it's a kitty cafe from the door
3
It was after dinner when we went there for dessert. The whole place was decorated like a garden. The entrance has displays of Hello Kitty merchandised. Upon entry, we are greeted by a huge Hello Kitty doll. Kitty fans can go gargar here. Ordered two desserts, one decorated like a house in a garden and the other had pudding and a scoop of ice cream. Both have a hello kitty white chocolate figure on i
3
Located just at the left hand side of the exit of flight arrival at Terminal 3 . Clean and fresh set up with white background and Hello Kitty posters . Appealing to younger crowd and kids who loves to take photograph with the kitty doll on the white bench . 5-6 friendly service staffs Coffee is a bit acidic but the Earl Gray is nice .can order some cakes , dessert and snacks .Not cheap . Great place to wait for delayed flight arrival .
3
Was waiting for my friend in the cafe as we had to catch a flight in a while. I had ordered a caramel coffee drink which was purported to be one of the bestsellers from the web. I couldn't bring myself to drink beyond the 3rd sip. It was too sweet and there's no trace of caffeine. My friend had ordered the carrot cake. I am sorry to say that it tasted not - fresh, as if it had been stored for days before serving. Despite the poor food quality, I would recommend the service quality of the crew. They were prompt and attentive.
2
The only reason we chose to dine at HK cafe was because our four-year old is currently into everything Hello Kitty.The food is mediocre in taste but sky-high in prices. Definitely not worth the price tag.We will not return to this place unless someone we're travelling with is keen to try the novelty of a Hello Kitty dining experience
3
My colleague is a big fan of hello kitty which explained why we went during lunch time. The decor, ambience and service are great. Just that the food, I wasn't that satisfied. The menu have limited western choice like only 3 choices for all day breakfast (I think). Anyway I chose a sandwich set for lunch. The portion is quite small, with a bowl of waffles fries and accompanied with a chicken sandwich that is made by two white toast stuffed with 2 small chunks of roasted chicken and some greens. It's definitely not work the $17+. I think Subway would fare better in terms of taste. However, it's hello kitty that drew everyone there. If u are a hello kitty fan, u can take lots of photo there. Too bad, I'm not so this will be my first and last trip there. It cost $100 for a total of 5 adults without drinks.
2
Overall experience is ok.Portion too small for the price for dessert and drinks. Quesadilla not to my taste. Variety too limited. But food doesn't stand out compared with other HK cafes. They'll hav realised the queues are gone for a reason. Japanese-style food too little. As a non-meat eater, I will not return but my sis said she will
3
Located at T3 arrival hall. The initial opening had a long queue. Today the queues is not there and many empty tables. We are immediately show the table for two.Look through the menu and don't think much variety. Order kitty goes fishing (salmon), rising kitty (chicken) & peach sunrise. The foods are nothing fantastic. The salmon is just plain. To me the food is just average except the decorations of the restaurant attracts the kids or supporters
4
Been to this cafe for 3 times and loving it. Each visit, staffs are friendly and knowledge on the availability of the menu. We did not need to queue for 3 occasions - 11am on Saturday, 12noon on Sunday and 11pm on Friday. Good served are all hot so are the drinks. Really a very happy to be and will for sure come back again.

The restaurant was located at the arrival hall of changi airport terminal 3, taking over a formerly cafe location. The place was not big and quite open too. Being a theme cafe, and hearing quite a number of poor reviews, we did not have much expectations. Although it was almost peak dinner period at 6.30pm, we were showed to a table almost at once. There were quite a number of unoccupied tables of 2, but most in the queue were families with members of 4 and above.Do not forget to take photo with Hello Kitty after getting a table. There is one right at the back of the restaurant and another in the middle of the restaurant. Remember not to order too much as the table was quite small.Latte ($5.90++)I had selected this drink, as it was the only drink with the Hello Kitty picture on it. The coffee was of a acidic type. It was served with a Hello Kitty Cookie.Strawberry marshmallow Tea ($7.80++)A fruity red colored tea. It was too, served with a Hello Kitty Cookie.Kitty Goes Bananas Split ($18.50++)The banana split features bruleed banana with brown sugar, accompanied with macarons and juicy berries. A classic combination of chocolate, vanilla and wild strawberry gelato sets the stage for this winning creation with a drizzle of marshmallow sauce and raspberry coulis.The gelato melt rather fast. I could not taste the vanilla flavour in the gelato. The berries were quite sour, while the macarons were quite hard.Hola Nachos! ($15.90++)Crunchy torilla chips topped with oodles of paramesan, jalapenos, olives, onions and cherry tomato salsa for that hint of tangy sweetness. Crowned with luscious cheese sauce.Although it looked simple, it was one of the best dishes to have among all.Overall service was not bad. Food was served quite fast. It was easy to get the attention of the staffs
3
After many reading many reviews on this cafe, the hub and I decided to come over for a drink. We sat in the one and only cradle, which is not very comfy (imo), and ordered:1. Cumbernade $7.90 2. Kitty Blush $7.90 3. Double scoop gelato: Wild strawberry & Pistachios $8.90 Overall, the cafe is not as fantastic as what we thot. But the drinks & gelato(s) are what we like. And the hub surprised me with a slice of birthday cake
3
For all Hello Kitty fans in Singapore, this is a must visit once.. Food was average, ambience was well designed. Unfortunately, they did not carry much keepsake items & memorabilia for sale in the shop
3
Went with family on a Sunday evening. Queue was not long and managed to get a seat for less than half an hour. The cafe is small as compared to the one in BKK. The orchids in the cafe brings out the cafe theme. However, the HK merchandise corner is limited. The menu doesn't have many choices too. The food taste is normal, nothing to wow about. But the food presentation is great, very instagrammable. The only disappointment we had in this visit is the poor service. Our drinks and dessert order was not taken on 2 separate occasions. We had to remind them of our orders.To sum it up, you must visit this cafe if you are a HK fan.

We were there for tea. The lunch crowd disappeared only after 3-4pm. We were not with big groups or are particular with the seating so we did not have to wait to be seated which was a relief! We had drinks "Kitty Blush" - too sweet and tasted too chemical, "strawberry marshmallow tea" - sweet, iced latte and a berry mousse sliced cake. The service staff were friendly and welcoming which makes us feel it worth visiting again although the food or drinks are not spectacular. A pretty muted HK themed cafe as compared to overseas. It's not shouting out loud kawaii-ness which allow the men to feel not so awkward. The only disappointing thing was there was not much selection for souvenirs to bring home because cookies and tea will perish. The local stamps would have been more worth it if it's printed with HK instead of having just the cover printed with HK.Appeal to management - please have the hello kitty plushie as a permanent souvenir for us to bring home. Thank you for giving us a HK cafe experience here in Sgp

I'm here on a Sunday afternoon non peak hour for a birthday celebration. There is still a short queue but it's quite fast to get a seat. The place has a nice warm and cosy ambience. A very photogenic place I would say. But the food is sort of average.. the salsa sandwich is beautifully made in appearance but the taste is quite normal. The fries that comes with it is flavorful. The drink sweet bouquet is a unique one with flowers as flavor. Can really taste the flower in the drink. I would consider it refreshing and not too sweet. The food and drinks are quite over price for the standard. The staff are friendly and helpful.

Went on a weekday afternoon for birthday celebration. Their menu is pretty standard. Hello Kitty fans out there you will be disappointed as there are only 2 hello kitty figures to take picture with and food garnish is not as fanciful as Taiwan's. Quality of food is average. I'll recommend the spaghetti and big breakfast. The fries tasted normal and personally I don't feel it's worth the price. The total bill for 5 pax is close to $180.

Nice ambiance, food and beverages are ok if you are not those picky sort of person. Suitable for tea break than a full meal dining because menu less variety for main courses. Is a 24hrs cafe and good place to chill out with friends those have kids. Long queue during weekend

I went with my daughter and mother around 5plus on a Saturday evening. We didn't wait long. We ordered a Big Breakfast Surprise, a Cappuccino and an Iced salted caramel latte. The meal was served fast but we waited a while for the coffee. The service was good as the staff were attentive. I dropped a knife and a staff immediately came forward to replace one for me. Another staff also came forward to check. Staff were friendly but cafe was not big. Food was fine but prices are not cheap. It's a must for Hello Kitty fans to visit and take picture although there's not many things for you to take photo

Queued for nearly two hours to get in and we were really excited about trying the cute and picture-worthy food! We ordered two brunch waffles and a sandwich which tastes pretty ordinary. And the waffles were slightly soggy and not crispy at all. We had a mocha and cuppucino and the coffee were horrible! Worst coffee we ever tried. Have a sour after taste and it's really unpleasant. Overall, it's not worth the hype and unless you're a fan of hello kitty, not recommended to visit

Decided to head to the airport and visit the new themed restaurant. The online reviews were mixed regarding the ambience and quality of food, so we did not had high hopes about it. It was a small outlet just beside the arrival hall. The decorations were pretty simple with orchid flowers and some hello kitty posters and stature, but it was enough for parents and fans to keep taking photos for about 15 mins around the restaurant. We ordered beef rendang "cowabunga" and breakfast set. We liked the food layout (face of kitty) and taste (3 out of 5 stars). Overall, it was a nice experience for us :

Treat it as a theme cafe. The food and even the coffee do not leave you any desire to return. Pricing is rather steep for the quality of food served. The coffee was not hot at all, and the taste, I think some of our instant coffee might be better
