Famous for legs porridge, the frog legs soy sauce is so-so, not many garlics and spices inside in ingredients. Only soy sauce and chilis. And also the porridge. Not as much as i expect though

Food is average. I chose frod porridge and its tase was just so so, not very impressive as I expected when getting recommendation from ohers. Service was ok.

This place is very local in the heart of Chinatown, order the porridge with shredded chicken! Also suggest grabbing some roast pork from next door with fried rice.

This was my usual late night hide out for beautiful pork porridge, or frog Claypot, or even raw fish years ago. This is after a late night @ Tiananmen night club with my boss. Now, the place is history. We haven't been back for years.Today, as I was meeting my 3 ex colleagues in smith street. I decided to have my regular pork porridge. $4.50 & egg adder $0.70. Its delivered to you promptly, hot & cooked the way it should be. These guys are good. Normally, livers are delivered over cooked but these guys knows just how to do the livers @ the right temperature & it's simply delicious.Back for more breakfasts ... keep up the standard. Awesome

This place got quite good review for its frog porridge so we decide to stop here for this signature dish. Turn out the other porridges were more delicious and the one we came for fell way off our expectation. The frog porridge in clay pot was not that impressive. The sauce is not thick and strong enough, quite plain, so when mix it with porridge it got even less tasty and flavorful. Well, the pork porridge was quite good, the "stuff" (pig organs) were well cooked, just right so the flavor and texture were very good. The outdoor seating is fun. Anyway, I would definite come back here, just not for the frog porridge, but for others porridge.

We wanted to eat frog legs porridge before we left Singapore and since we had only time for lunch, and the rest of the places were closed during lunch, our friends took us here.Non AC, in a "coffee-shop" like environment, not too bad considering the heat outside. But it was a big of a sweat after eating the hot porridge! Parking could be a pain but we scored a place right out front. MRT nearby so easy to catch a train here.We had the usual porridge, tofu and vegetables. The tofu and vegetables were ok, the usual. The highlight was the frog legs porridge, porridge was good - texture smooth - the frog legs were a bit disappointing though - while the frog legs were fresh, the dish lacked the "umph" - not enough umami and lacks the kick from the dried chili. It felt bland to me - but still, considering this is about the only game in town for reputable stalls, beggars can't be choosers. Next time, find time for supper to go eat the dish elsewhere

Ordered a Sotong porridge, claypot fish and beancurd.Very hawker style and very nice. To me, a Penangite, this is something very representative of Nanyang Chinese food.Highly recommend to traveller from other continent if you want to experience the food culture of SEA Chinese.Cleanliness: acceptablePrice: average. Spend about 10SGDLocation: perfect.

I was informed this place is very famous for its frog legs congee and it's fish noodles .We opted for fish slices rice noodles that came in a large clay pot. Large at SGD9The thick rice noodles akin to spaghetti but white in colour and made of rice was soft and springy.There were some vegetables and fish slices , ginger and yellow beans.The soup was not too thick it was great to warm our tummy after a delayed flight and we wanted to have something light and soupy. It is quite busy and you must be prepared to wait... Worth to come back to when u are in the area :

It's my first time to try frog porridge!!! cannot explain my feeling it's delicious though. But first I just don't know how to eat it.

Not feeling well lately. The porridge here always brings a form of comfort to me whether as a late night supper or simply delicious comforting "sick" person food. Love their thick porridge that comes with different options for different moods.

Just wanted to had some porridge after days of heavy meal.
This Resturant serve Cantonese porridge at local price.
It is very popular for local therefore it may take a while to get a seat

Porridge is nice but surprisingly its Hor Fun is even nicer. Throughout the dinner, could see every table would order hor fun.
Service is pretty fast too. Not bad.

I was a bit dubious when my Singaporean host suggested we head into Chinatown to have frog rice porridge for dinner.But I was pleasantly surprised. We order two different types of frog, Schechuan which was in a hot pot with dried chills and spices, and another one with ginger and sliced spring onions.The hot pots came with bowls of rice porridge into which we spooned our selection of frog.Tiong Shian Porridge Centre is in a busy part of Singapore's Chinatown and on the night we went the restaurant was especially busy, so we had to share a table with other diners.For the three of us the bill was a modest S$55

Located at Chinatown, very near MRT station and open to 4AM make it suitable to people who want to discover nightlife of Singapore. The frog porridge is good and has many choices of flavour, however I feel them less surprise when tasting. Interestingly, the kumquat juice or kind like that was very good and cheap. I bought more to drink on the next day morning

I wasn't expecting this much bone on slide of fish in my porridge. It made so hard to eat. Every time I want to eat those slides of fish I needed my hand dirty to pulled at least 6-7 bones out. It shouldn't be like this. The porridge itself was quite good. I may try chicken one next time. Hope it will be no bone in them too.

I was in Chinatown one weekend morning and was feeling hungry. I decided to pop to have some porridge for breakfast. This stall is housed in a coffee stall at a corner shophouse that faces CK Department stall. I ordered the sliced fish and cuttlefish porridge. It has thinly sliced 西刀 'Sai Dou' fish and cut pieces of cuttlefish. The porridge is done traditional style, which reminds me of 'home-cooked' porridge. It’s a good-sized portion for $4.50. Filled me up nicely. This eatery gets really crowded at night, with people sitting on tables along the walkway
