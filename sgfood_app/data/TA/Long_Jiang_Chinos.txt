We had to endure the second hand cigarette smoke from smokers at the pavilion overlooking the artificial fishing pond, they might well be patrons who pay to fish, from what I understand it‚Äôs illegal to smoke in any outdoor setting that is under a roof, and the pavilion counts as a roof, but there‚Äôs nobody to enforce the law. Singapore‚Äôs weather is too warm to dine outdoors comfortably. If the temperature was 10 degrees lower, it would have been fine. The ventilator blowers have no effect. I wish my family had chosen a regular Chinese restaurant in a hotel or a mall, which we usually do but some family wanted to be kay kiang this year.

Long Jiang Chinos ('LJC') is a Chinese restaurant established by Long Jiang Culinary, an F&B group that has years of experience in the culinary industry. They are the main curator of F&B delights in Singapore Turf Club. Located in quaint and serene ORTO in Yishun, LJC provides a unique dining experience in the North part of Singapore. It has an alfresco dining concept and most of the dining area faces the lake. The huge outdoor air circulator and cooling system will ensure you still dine in comfort during those hot and stuffy days. It is a good dining destination, within a close distance to Yishun heartland that re-live the Kampung spirit. We kick start the tasting with Baby Squid ($14). A favourite entr√©e in seafood restaurants in Singapore. The little squid is deep fried till crispy and tossed with the sweet sauce that normally made from honey, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. It is delicious and you can't stop munching it. Fish Skin with Salted Egg Yolk ($8.80) and Crispy Fried Har Chou ($12 for 8 pcs). It is actually two separate dishes, the kitchen put them together to make it look big. The fish skin is crispy topped with fluffy powdery salted egg yolk. The Har Chou is crisp with solid and generous fillings. I find both of this dishes actually complement each other nicely. Seafood Hotpot ($128 good for 4 to 5 pax). The signature dish of LJC. The whole Soon Hock fish is simmered on a bed of cabbage with other live seafood such as prawns, clams, and squid with chicken stock. All the seafood ingredients are fresh. You can taste the firmness and sweetness in the prawns, while the clams and squid have it natural springiness in it. As the fish is cooked on the bed of cabbage, it only touched the stock a little bit so it was not overcooked. The combination of ginger and garlic on top of the fish, add another zip of flavour to this dish. Once you mixed the ginger and garlic combo to the soup, it will warm up your stomach with each slurp of the broth. A good dish to consume during the rainy season, or any time of the year. Stir Fried Fine Beans & Crispy Shredded Yam in Guangzhou Style ($14). Crunchy fine beans topped with crisp shredded yam. LJC added lap cheong into this dish to perk up the taste and texture at the same time. Rojak Chicken ($16). Crispy, succulent deep fried chicken topped with Rojak sauce. The prawn paste sauce is just irresistible. Yum yum. Cheesy Crab Bee Hoon with Crab Roe ($44.80). This dish uses 2 female mud crabs, similar to the Indonesian version of mud crabs. The broth is a fusion between a robust stock with creaminess from the cheese. The bee hoon did well to soaks up the full flavour of this dish while maintaining its texture. The crabs are sweet and love the roe in the crab shell. Dessert was Yam Paste with Ginkgo Nuts - $12 (small). We were stuffed almost to the brim, so we decided to go for a small version of this dessert. The yam paste is soft, smooth but you can still taste the fiber from the yam, which is good. The pumpkin and ginkgo give this dish a contrasting flavour and texture. Definitely one of the better Orh Nee I ever tried. Overall, Long Jiang Chinos offer a unique dining experience with Kampong atmosphere. The seafood are fresh, the price is reasonable and it tasted great as well. Definitely, a must try place in Yishun. Cheers!

It is really a very nice bar/restaurant to go for evening drinks. The pond, lights around, the constant back and forth of MRT trains in a distance just add to the magic of this place. Long Island Iced tea was good at SGD18.80. I have had much better but this was fine too, and sipping the cool drink in such atmosphere is remarkable. They have a big outdoor smoking section so that helps too. Many tables had beer towards suggesting it is quite popular with group of friends

Food was great, fresh & tasty....with good "wok hei". Ordered two different sharks fin as oldies in family wanted it. Said was good. I had none as its such a politically incorrect dish!! The gem in this place is their super attentive service team. Friendly & helpful. Dirty dishes cleared away quickly, beer mugs topped up & even offered to serve up dishes. Overall really good experience. Highly recommend. Will definitely visit again before heading back to NZ.

We had lunch at the place and enjoyed their cooking. There was flavour and taste in the food. The setting is nice with a good view of the fishing pond. One waitress was super friendly and helpful. Will surely go again and try some other food and drinks. Oh yes, the orange juice was remarkably sweet and fresh. The waitress said they source only the best oranges and discard the sour ones

Generally okay food in a surrounding which they have taken over from Bottle Tree Pack restaurant.Price is on the high side when taken into consideration of its location. A plate of 6 wings costing $12 dollars is difficult to accept even though we are having dinner in the most expensive city in the world

The overall disappointment was the Crab Beehoon as there are still those fishy smelly taste and smell within even they tried to put in more blue ginger!! The taste totally OUT!! This is the killer dish which cost u a lot but with a big thumb down!! So this is not all which really spoils the day...The fried fish skin and Shark fin were great* A MUST TO TRY* !! The tofu with minced meat so so ...but acceptable~ SVC of staffs = Great!

We decided to dine at this location for convenience, expecting to pay higher as this restaurant is located in Orto.We ordered 5 dishes, Crab with Bee Hoon in Claypot (Recommended by staff as this is a promotion item), 4 season peas, prawn paste chicken wings, noodle, deep fried fish skin, plus 2 pints of beers and a drink, It costs us $140Dining in a windy and nice environment, with very friendly, attentive and helpful staffs, I will consider this price tag as worthwhile.The crab with bee hoon in claypot is really a good dish, the soup is very tasty, crab is also very fresh, size is probably close to 800gPersonally, I like the deep fried fish skin, they said is the skin of groupa, perfect "beer food" for meRecommended to dine here before leaving OrtoOne thing to take note, if you prefer to sit next to the fishing pond (view), need to call in for reservation. The peak is during Friday and Saturda

Place is located in a man made sanctuary, I kinda liked the setup of the place. The food serves mainly seafood, and abit on the pricey side for the portions served. Service was prompt and good but the food has too much MSG, gulping down water after that dinner was endless..
