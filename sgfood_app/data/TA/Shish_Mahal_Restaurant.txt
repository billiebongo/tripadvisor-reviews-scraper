We ate at the restaurant when they had a buffet special. Good choice of food and tasty. Servers were freindly and helpful.
5
We had one delicious meal here. Thoughly enjoyed the experience and the wait staff were very attentive.
4
we were going to go to banana leaf apolo but the rain was coming down in casks so we went over the road from our hotel.the food was extremely good and we had quite a pleasent evening as the staff were quite friendly.
4
Good Indian and Nepalese food. Pricey but good value for money. Ambiance is okay and average service. Definitely worth a try !!!
4
We were staying at the Village Court Hotel, a few steps away. After having a long day sight seeing, we thought we'd stay close to the hotel. We are glad we did, a good choice. Really good food, very attentive staff and reasonably priced.
5
We cannot recommended this place highly enough. The food was sublime and the service was amazing. Visited 6 times over a 4 week period as it was so good. Never disappointed and can’t wait to go back when we return in March. Told all our friends about this place. Great restaurant.
5
Tucked away in a quiet courtyard you will find this excellent Indian restaurant. There are plenty of tables outdoors as well as indoors. We had excellent service from gracious staff. Popadoms and water are brought to your table soon after you sit down so that you can nibble while you read the extensive menu. We had starters of onion bahgies and pakoras( a huge plate!), followed by butter chicken and lamb rogan josh, rice and naan bread. All of the food was excellent. There is a full range of drinks-alcoholic and non-including the famous Singapore Sling, wine, beer, etc
5
It was a cold wet night. We didnt want to stray too far from our hotel. We chose this restaurant and ordered the tandoori prawn, butter chicken, aloo gobi. And proceeded to b3 mindblown. Ive eaten my fair share of north indian food in sg and this is one of the best, if not best, out here. Excellent service and vibes too
1
The food was average, nothing great and service was definitely another turn off. We been to many places to dine and this was by far the worst. Will definitely not recommend Nor return ever. It will be good if the restaurant management can send the Malaysian staffs for training.

So that is saying a lot-as there are tons of Indian places to eat especially in this area of town, on the fringe of Little India. I first discovered Shish Mahal when I stayed across the pedestrian street at the Village Albert Court Hotel in February and have since come back several times in May and most recently this month right before the Deepavali Holiday. They even had a special Diwali buffet menu in addition to the extensive sit down menu. The seating is enormous out front with many tables covered from the sun...or rainy downpours. I’ve eaten outside in both and during the day and night and find it completely comfortable. They have large fans and chillers to make the outdoor tables comfy in the Singapore heat & humidity. There is a lovely inside section as well. I’ve always eaten outside. I have been there so many times now that some of the waiters recognize me as a regular-pretty amazing since I’m from the USA! There are some pretty decent happy hour drink specials so be sure to ask. I took advantage of buy 2 Kingfishers and get a 3rd free. Their bartenders make some delicious cocktails too. I’ve had a better Singapore Sling here than the one at Raffles! The menu is immense and diverse with lots of northern and southern (vegetarian) cuisine on offer. My favorites include the butter chicken with saffron rice and the garlic naan is some of the fluffiest and most flavorful I’ve ever had. I’m also fond of the paneer and onion bhaji. You really can’t go wrong with anything you order here. There are many locals spending an entire leisurely evening here for a meal. That is a wonderful sign for me. I haven’t gotten to the desserts yet as I stuff myself beforehand-they look very good from what I’ve seen others order. My hearty thanks for many a wonderful meal here this year. I will be back in January 2018 for sure on my next visit to Singapore

Good Indian food is always a challenge, but ambiance matters. good outdoor seating, nice appetizers. good selection of dishes.
4
Taken to this restaurant with friends who always eat here. Excellent service great food. Seated outside, great atmosphere
4
Dood reastaurent in Village Albert court hotel having nice Indian food like Tandoori, Biriyani etc. Good
5
A local friend made us aware of this place. We had a very good time. Because we had ordered so much, our drinks went to the house. The Indian food was outstanding!
5
excellent meal without having to cross the road into Little India.Little India was on our doorstep with great service
4
This Restaurant is a must if staying at the Albert Street Village Hotel, its in the court and only a minute or so from your room. The menus is extensive and caters for all tastes, the waiter was very helpful and attentive to our needs. The food was fabulous and plenty of it, the naan bread is some of the best I've tasted, the aloo gobbi masala and Rogan Josh were just right. The beer and wine was cheep and cold so if you want to experience some of the good Indian food of Singapore it's a great place to start, the breeze is refreshing in the Singaporean heat when dining elfresco at the Shish Mahal. After your meal you can have a stroll into the Indian sector down Serangoon Road just minutes away or go to the micro brewery next door or just hang about for more wine and beer at the Restaurant, we enjoyed our meal there and we are sure you will to, remember, take it for what it is, not what you want it to be and you will have a great experience

I was so disappointed. Having happy memories of my time n Nepal I was so looking forwad to eating Nepalese food. I nearly ordered Dal, which later I wished I had. I dd however order vegetable Mo Mo's which I had a lot in Nepal. I only managed 3 of them before I had to give up - they were feiry hot and just burnt the mouth. There was no delicacy or flavour of the vegetables. Certainly not typical Nepalese food in my experience of it in Nepal. There should be a warning in my opinion if chilli is in a vegetable food because that is not what was ordered. However, a nice spot for a Beer and pleasant enough surroundings with the Albert Court ambience
3
We went to this award winning restaurant to see if it was worth the hype. The restaurant offered a wide selection of North Indian and Nepalese dishes. The taste was alright. Some dishes such as the chili paneer was great and some such as the butter chicken were just ok. The serving for some of the dishes were extremely small. Given its standard and how affordable Indian food is in Singapore, I found this place rather expensive
4
Go for the dal, go for the mix veg, go for the paneer dishes - i am sure you will relish it. Located very close to the Albert Court Village Hotel - Shish Mahal is richer by the wow service. not very heavy on the pocket - this restaurant is a true ge
5
I've been eating at this restaurant for a number of years when I've come to Singapore. The food has always been excellent and it was no surprise to hear that it has been mentioned in the Michelin Guide. It's a plain but comfortable restaurant and you can eat inside, or outside on the lovely pedestrianised mall. It is one minute's walk from the Albert Court Hotel where I usually stay. Besides the quality of the food the service is also very good and friendly
3
We went there around 5 PM wanting to eat a good Biriyani. Ordered chicken Biriyani expecting a Nawabi style 'Biriyani. The service was fast but the biriyani did not taste fresh. Somewhat dissatisfied with the taste & freshness. We sat outdoors which was nice .
4
I really enjoy the food . The food was very delicious and taste.All the waiters are very kind and good respected.
4
A really nice place to have great food. Location is nice, one of the few places where there's cozy outdoor seating. Plenty of choices for food, great to order many dishes to share.
4
Food
I ordered chicken (murgh) korma.
What was great? The chicken korma. The vegetables (aloo gobi masala).
Dessert
Shahi Tukda. Must try. I have never seen this anywhere else.
Drinks
I had mango lassi.
They seem to have outdoor seating.
Ground floor toilets, convenient.
5
Surprising Good North Indian food served here. The closet to the real North Indian food that you get in DELHI
5
The restaurant is part of the Village Hotel, Albert Court complex. It has seating indoors and outside in a pleasant pedestrianised street setting. The overall impression on approach is of a welcoming establishment. I arrived early evening and I was hungry. I decided to have a mild curry butter chicken, naan bread and rice. A nice cool pint of heineken to accompany the meal was very welcome too. The food was excellent and I recommend this restaurant to you
4
Since we were staying in Parc soverign, we had dinner one night. The north indian dishes were good. I also like the point that they lay most of the tables outside and the environment is really niceI recommend this hotel if u are staying nearby to parc sovereign and u are looking for north indian food. Did not see much of south indian varietie
5
Shish Mahal is truly one of the many Indian restaurants in Singapore that stand out for its quality of food offered. From the sizzling mixed grill to the succulent pieces of butter chicken, Shish Mahal is a must for Indian food lovers! I recently found out that they even won the Michelin Bip Gourmand Award! The owner, Mr. Gary is a warm personality that has turn his dedication and commitment to excellence. Kudos to the team at Shish Mahal
4
I stayed in the Albert Court area of Singapore, very near to Little India. I didn't want to walk far on my own in the evening, and didn't want a big meal, so I wandered into this North Indian and Nepalese, open-air restaurant, part of the Albert Court outdoor eating area, minutes from my hotel. The staff were really helpful and friendly, happy to serve me just soup, samosa and nan bread. All were delicious but the 'chicken hot and sour soup' was perfect for my light supper. And I got to watch several clips of Indian 'Bollywood-style' dancing on the TV, which set the mood on a warm Singapore night
4
We're staying opposite this restaurant at the Village hotel. We've been in Singapore for 2 nights and travelled to many different parts of the island. We're leaving tomorrow so thought we'd try the Indian across the road. It is excellent . Good choice of food well cooked and we'll presented. I wish I'd have found it earlier
5
Excellent food and service. Food was authentic Nepalese and North Indian and was a lovely experience in the restaurant with great service and professional staff
5
Staff Ravi provides excellent service, good food, friendly service. Fish is fresh, beer very cold. Good location for transport and near hotel
5
I've been coming here for years and its still superb! There is nothing fancy about the al -fresco dining, yet the Indian / Nepalese food is outstanding and great value.
Try the Samosa Chaat and Fish in Banana leaf!
3
Had dinner twice here during our recent trip to Singapore.
Good Indian taste - all the dishes we ordered were good.
However, the best part was the extremely fast free wifi connectivity - more than 100 mbps- unbelievable!
5
Had lunch here on our final day in Singapore. Das (the owner) very friendly as were all the staff. Food very tasty and large portions. Would highly recommend
5
Twice I visited this restaurant and had Paneer Kadai. The food was excellent, may be I can say a bit better than we get punjabi food in India too. Also the naan was pretty soft and stayed soft even after quite a few time had passed
5
It was my first time eating this kind of cuisine but not indian and i must say it is very different but not less excellent. Nice service and great choice of foods. Love the chicken hakka noddle and steamed momo. Expect 10mn wait for the momos price are reasonable as well
3
I came to know about this place from Michelin Bib guide and went on a weekend dining spree with the beloved wife to test the taste of Bib Singapore. The place is very close to village hotel and does not give the impression like the other Indian restaurant @ Little India. We tried Chicken Hakka noodle ( ok), Fried Momo (good), one Nepalese mutton curry (ok). Overall average we spent SGD92 including drinks for 3 persons (including the kid) -if u are a momo lover better options are available just across the road @ Fifth season - but overall a good experience
5
I came to know this restaurant as i always drink at a bar next to it. One of my friends recommended it to me so i said, i'd try it. That was a year ago. Now, everytime i have friends from the other parts of the world whose got an appetite for an Indian Cuisine, i'd always bring them here. I'd probably brought a lot of my friends here. First, the food is amazing. I so love the Butter Chicken and the Regular Naan combo. Second, all the staff are so friendly. They already knew me by face as i always go there at least once a month and sometimes three times a month to grab dinner.Third, the location is awesome. You can either order beers from them or drink at the bars next to it.Four, the price is so affordable for a restaurant in a very good location.So if you that thirst for Indian Food, i would highly advise to try this restaurant and i am very much sure that you will come back again and again
4
Food is great and for Singapore, quite reasonably priced. We had 2 pints if beer, a shared starter, 2 mains with rice & naan for $75 including tax & service. The Chilli pakoras were great & pack a punch! Some of the outside tables are smoking so make sure you ask first, mid way through our dinner we had to move tables to avoid being gassed by a family who lit up right next to us while we were eating
5
Had a wonderful lunch here. Portioning, Taste, Ambience, Service was good. Will definitely visit here again very soon
5
People who want a variety of Indian food should have at least 2 meals here.One can get 10% flat discount on bill if he has stayed in Albert Court.I strongly recommend the Thali (Deluxe) to taste!
4
Visited here after a yoga class. Service was prompt. Chicken kebabs with saffron were tender and beautifully spiced. Biryani was also of a very high quality. Would return
4
we stayed at the albert court hotel, hence this restaurant was most convenient. the food was very good the first time we tried and there after we had our food almost daily at this place. staff is good too.
4
Within the hotel complex, with Northern Indian and Nepalese food. Helpful staff, tasty meals and reasonable price.
3
A bit expensive, food very average, basic service. I will certainly not return, as this area has much more to offer
1
We had dinner at this place and it was fully booked. Considering the review and crowd we took a table but I don't think it's worth either.We ordered a paneer chat Pata masala. It was dripping oil and paneer chewy like gum.Roomali roti looked like chapati.Dal was average. Everything lacked salt and taste. Do not recommend this restaurant at all!
1
We ordered steamed Momo's from this "authentic" Nepalese restaurant, i cannot fully describe how horrible it was! Out of the 6 pieces, one was already broken when it was served to us. I fail to understand how steamed momos were dripping of oil The momos were modak's stuffed with garam masala and some pungent boiled vegetables. HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT! The main course was more disappointing with chatpata paneer being super shaddy mixture of oil along with some pieces of chewy paneer. Only good thing was papad and mint Chutney that we got free with some beer that we ordered in the start of the meal :|75$ gone down the drain!
4
I've been living in Singapore for long but never been here. The restaurant is not that spacious but consists two sections with about 30 plus seats for dining! We started with some starters like Paneer pakora, Veg Mo Mo & some spring rolls. All were excellent with authentic taste. Our main course were Naan Basket with varities if Naans. Tasty Tandoori chicken & Mysore mutton went well with Naan. We finished with hot cup of Masala Chai where kids had Gulab Jamun! Altogether it was sumptuous tasty and worth money spent! Will go again
4
I was staying in the Albert Court Village Hotel and didn't fancy trekking far so opted for the Shish Mahal. I think I was initially the only diner, so a bit of a gamble. Helpful waiter. Went for Prawn Malaba - delicious, not too spicy. Later on noticed a couple of Indian guys were eating there. I thought the prices were a bit high but maybe that was in comparison to the million eateries I found the next day
5
Wonderful Tandoori Chicken, generous meat and vegetarian set menus, unforgettable Dal and grilled paneer on skewers not forgetting the Goan fish curry. Welcoming popidoms and dips offered by a great team. I also enjoy savouring the delicious Nepalese dishes.
5
Best halal food restaurant in little india . Food quality is really good and spicy level is as per your requirement . Service is really good and yellow dal with achar is a combination not to miss.
2
just opposite to Hotel Parc Soverign and Albert street.
food quality and taste not upto the mark.
there are plenty of other options
4
the restaurant has variety offering. the chicken and daal are very good. if you want you can ask for pickle and small salad. otherwise you can order from their salad offering. the service is good. they serve halal food.
5
Great restaurant we enjoyed our food good service extensive menu. Fast service and very comfortable seating outside.
5
We ate here during our stay at the Albert Court hotel. We sat inside as it was a bit cooler than outside (even at 9pm at night!) and also because smoking was allowed outside. The food was lovely with good spice, and staff were friendly. For 2 of us the bill came to S$90 (a bit more than we would normally spend but does include alcohol) and would eat here again.
5
My husband and I had a very pleasant dinner in this restaurant during our stay in Singapore. The food is delicious, dishes are big, prices are reasonable.It was a St. Valentine's day and they gave a rose to my husband to give it to me, it was really sweet
1
Food was average. Looks good from outside. True Indian restaurant but gives more importance to foreigners. Staff were not behaving professional. Found hair in lemon juice and seafood starter. Returned the food back and waited for almost am hour for the fresh one... Finally we had to cancel the order and leave!!
4
We had the opportunity of a few days in Singapore and a chance to try one or two places to eat as you do well if you like curry this one is not to be missed the service good food excellent and atmosphere good we sat out side it was a lovely evening watching people go by we will certainly be going back the next time we are in SingaporeFrank and Rosemary Devon U
5
The service here was excellent as was the food. We asked for chef recommendations to serve seven people with various breads. All of us loved the food and enjoyed the various dishes. It was slightly more expensive than the street style food we had the previous night (which was also good and very cheap). But, the quality of the food well and truly matched the cost
5
if you love to explore indian food, this is the place to go! reasonable price and worth it! nice food indeed!
4
Vijay was really helpful in selecting meals for our group of seven. Meals are not too spicy for westerners. Very tasty and ok on price. A great option for those staying at village hotel Albert court.
3
I had my lunch at this place on the first day. The food was OK but not great! In terms of pricing they are average.
4
Eating out under the nightsky in Singapore with a cold Tiger beer and a plate of delicious asian-inspired delights - could it get any better.
5
Can't remember what I ordered now, it was a few months back, but we thought the food was average to good. Didn't blow us away but was not disappointing at all. The al fresco area is nice. Away from the street, but gets good walk through traffic for people watching. Sitting out there at night was quite a pleasant experience. Busy enough for a good atmosphere. Service was decent
1
Worst staff and service after visiting so many restaurant in Singapore. Staff was rude and took almost 1 hr in getting our order when only 4-6 guest were there in restaurant. We were waiting for our next set of bread and then suddenly one staff member came and said if u r finish can I clean the table.. They should be aware of these little things.. Talked to another male staff about delay in service and he said in Singapore u will get this type of service only. how can they damage Singapore image with their fault. This kind of behavior happened on two days.. Some staff was from Albert cafe inside Albert hotel and they were very good in behavior but rest of the staff was shame on Albert court hotel's shish mahal restaurant..
5
Ate here last night; wonderful menu, and the food was incredibly tasty. We had the momo, vegetable shashlik, mutton dopiaza and naans. It was all fabulous and full of flavour. Could not fault the food one bit. My only complaint would be the manner in which the staff grouped and hovered nearby during off-peak hours. It was if they were surveying their kingdom. I understand it is important to be attentive but it was a little oppressive to have them pretty much stand guard over us for the duration. That said, I would definitely eat here agai
2
We're not expecting anyone to fawn over us, far from it. But the person taking our order didn't even look at us: it was like we didn't even exist. When the food did come, he just thumped it down and went off. The food itself was just about okay - the tomatoes in the bhindi were smelling strange, and for the price we paid, the food was certainly not tasty
5
Good Indian Food, but they don't know how to cook Goan Fish. Instead of adding Coconut Milk they add Fresh Cream :) , it was tasty though. They cook very fresh food and I found it very well balanced , medium spice and medium salt, was just perfect. Recommended.
4
Enjoyed my meal here,I do enjoy Indian food,& this was a good one.Set in a fairly quiet courtyard,so nice surroundings away from the hustle & bustle of the main Little India area,so was good to relax with a beer & good food.Service was pretty good,they were fairly busy,always a good sign for me,& the price for what we had was reasonable,if Singapore can ever be classed as reasonable
4
Restaurant serves authentic Indian dishes .. We had Paneer and Dal and it was yummy .. Staff was very courteous .. The restaurant has open sitting and the overall ambience is good
4
Good service, lots of choices for their Indian delights, the spice is powerful, but a bit noisy as there are some regulars, i think, drinking at the corner of their outdoor area, talking aloud whole night.
5
Excellent food, couldn't fault anything. Friendly atmosphere, top class service 10 out of 10 would definitely eat here again
5
Excellent food , 2 mins from hotel , friendly staff . Good menu open all day ,reasonable prices .Fans to keep you cool if its a hot day or night outside ,
4
You get authentic Indian food here but is slightly expensive. The sit out and ambience is cheerful. But I recommend this.
5
I had been to Shish Mahal with my friends and enjoyed the food. The service was excellent, owner of the restaurant was personally giving an attention to all the guest which makes them so special. The surrounding of the place is very quite and peaceful. I would highly recommend this place
3
I would have given this restaurant a 4 star rating but I chose a variation of the chicken tikka which said it used breast meat (the other 2 or 3 said boneless chicken). When it arrived, the flavour was fine, but it certainly wasn't breast meat, and I had paid more for it! It makes me worry about the quality and sourcing of the meat you get in Singapore restaurants. The chicken meat must come in square blocks marked 'chicken'
2
We ordered paneer achari tikka for appetizers and it was literally the worst I have ever had. The paneer did not look fresh or maybe it was the preparation - oily and tasteless. We left almost 90% of the dish.Main course was okayish - malai kofta, channa with Puri(oily again). For a $62 bill which is generally expensive for 2 people, the quality of food was really poor
4
We got to this place by chance. And it turned out to be a good experience overall, so we have decided to go there again.Serves veg and non-veg Indian dishes. We stayed with veg since it was Dhanterash and we still had plenty of options.Tasted great bundi laddus after a long time.My suggestion would be to go for dinner as you can sit out and enjoy nice ambience along with good food. Inside could be a bit cosy if you do not get the right table which was the case with us. Still nothing to complain as staff and service quality will not let you notice it.They serve drinks as well...just in cas
5
We ate here twice during our stay. We couldn't fault anything. Although not being experts on Indian food it was probably two of the best Indian meals we have had. Good attentive service. We thought it was reasonably priced. Alcohol boosts the costs somewhat. Singapore is certainly not the place if you enjoy a few drinks with your meal
5
Ate here in the early evening before exploring more of Little India. The courtyard setting is very pleasant and reasonably quiet despite being close to a busy road. The food was good and reasonably priced and the service friendly and prompt.
5
Best food available , Indian thali is the best , very helpful and friendly staff .
Loved the expirence
5
With lots of food options for India fine dinning this is the right place. Place around is calm and you can enjoy for hours and hours.
3
Nice courtyard ambiance with attentive service and good choice of food. Limited selection of beers. Inside seating not so nice, but when it is nor raining outside seating is ok.
5
Make sure sure have either the Mutton or Prawn Briyani. The portion is really generous. Love their naans and butter chicken as well. The quality has remained constant all these years.
4
Very NIce place for Indian Cuisine. I had almost 3 dinner's here since my son only wanted to eat the chicken which they prepared. Average Cost per meal was around 35 SGD
4
Situated in the Village Hotel Albert Court courtyard, this is the most easily accessible restaurant if you are staying at Village Albert court. The food is good and reasonably priced. Do not forget to ask for your discount, if you are a guest staying at the Village Hotel Albert Court. The restaurant did not tell us. We got to know when we asked. They serve all North Indian dishes and the food quality is good as well. Definitely, worth visiting, if you are starving for North Indian food in Singapore
4
The Shish Mahal Restaurant is located in Albert Court, right next to the Parc Hotel we stayed at in Singapore. One nice evening we sat in the courtyard with some exotic drinks and watched the world go by.. outside it is like a pub, with very fast service by smiling waiters. Bar prices seemed reasonable. We did not eat at inside at the Indian Restaurant, but it looked quite exotic! Maybe next time...
4
Our hotel was next door so it was last stop for us before we retire. Tummy filling tasty Indian food after a long day we enjoyed. They offer icewater and aplams complimentary which is not usual at other places. We had vegetarian food and it was good
2
It was a good place for alfresco dining, it was my past experience. But currently poor management can be visible in all aspects. During my last weekend visit , Serving glasses noted with lip marks. When asked to change, again got a similar glass. finally I opt for no glass and drink from a bottle.Quality of food also down. It is not a good place to dine
4
I´v been there in March 2015 and had a very nice dinner while sitting outside.
The service was great and the food came fast. It was really very tasty!
4
The restaurant was in the courtyard right outside of my hotel, Albert Court, so was very convenient. Better still, the food was really good. Very authentic Indian food, nice and spicy.
2
We ordered Indian Thali and Biryani. Though it was good quantity, the quality of the food was really average. Service was just okay too,.
4
the location is accessible by MRT, the food is lovely and authentic, you can eat indoors or al fresco. Interior where the buffet is laid out is a bit small, inside seating a bit crowded, outside seating lovely.
4
As we stayed in village albert court.....we had meal here twice...we had veg thali..it was good ....tasty a very good option opposite to our hotel.staff was average...not very good.
5
Both meals wonderful. Great Indian food, affordable at around 20$ per meal for 2 of us each time. The taste of the food is great.
4
Nice hotel next to Park Soverign hotel at Albert Road. Here you can get all Indian foods with lots of varieties. Food is delicious as comparing to other restaurant we have visited in Singapore. Price is average. You can enjoy food outside restaurant too. There is arrangement outside too.
5
This was our favourite restaurant during our stay in Singapore at the nearby Albert Court hotel just across the courtyard. It was the only restaurant open in the vicinity when we returned late from an evening out and we received such a nice welcome and good advice about our menu choices that we went back twice more during our stay. Each time the food was delicious and the service excellent - we were made to feel very welcome and really enjoyed our friendly conversations with the staff. As we were guests at the Albert Court hotel they gave us a discount on your bill. We would highly recommend this super little restaurant.
5
I Been there more then 5 times for dinner and lunch in my 7days stay.... There food is tasty I can say delicious... I tried there thali on the last day... And its Good enough for 2 person just need to add some 1 naan. Affordable price... Must visit
3
The ambience is nice -- you get the street-food ambience and yet get the privacy of a courtyard. The food is passable in quality though the portions are generous. What passes for Indian is really not authentic tasting and the Chinese food get an Indian flavour added
4
Right next to Albert Court Hotel this restaurant has good Indian food, good and fast service and Air-con inside
5
Great little Nepalese restaurant in Little India. Tasty, yummy food a and great price. We asked them to make us Sagg Aloo which wasn't on the menu and it was so nice. Great staff too. Great Indian food. Thank you!
4
Good ambience in very appealing courtyard. Indian food very tasty and service good but unobtrusive. Clean toilets!
4
Well worth a visit. It is good northern Indian cuisine at a reasonable price. The goat curry was excellent, The chicken Curma was great and after the Mango Lassie the Massala Tea made the meal a very nice experience.
4
Very welcoming with good quality food and wine. If you stop here for a drink you get poppadums and a spicy yogurt dip. Good value. The only downside is the incessant noise created by other bars playing loud music in the square.
5
As this place was right outside our hotel, we had dinner here. The paneer butter masala and naans are excellent. They also packaged the food so that we could take it to the hotel room and eat it there. Good taste!
3
We had most of our meals in Shish Mahal and the punjabi food served by the restaurant is really good with both veg and non veg dishes. Do not go for chinese as it is out of the world that you might not like.The service is overall good if you are visiting for 1 or 2 times, but in case of repeated visits you might see a deterioration in the services
3
Situated within the albert court hotel, shish mahal is a good Indian restaurant and a nice place to chill out. The food is superb, specially the starters from Tandoor. Watch out for the service charge that they add without letting you know. If you're staying at Albert court, they give you a 10% discount. Overall: 8/1
3
Right outside the Albert Court Hotel, so very convenient, especially when it is raining.Food was average - I asked for the mildest curry as I am allergic to chillies, but some of the food was quite hot. Average price, although alcohol quite expensive. A moisturising hand tissue was automatically put on our plate, and we were surprised that it was added on to the bill, as well as a service fee
4
After a walk round Little India, this was the first restaurant I felt I would like to eat in. This was my last evening in Singapore, and if I had been there longer I might have experimented more with more street food shops - Shish Mahal is a proper restaurant though. I love Indian food, and this restaurant offered a menu that I understood better than most places I ate in Singapore. The theme is northern India / Nepalese cuisine. There were some inventive starters, and I had a vegetarian dish, with samosa as the base, with chickpeas, yoghurt and cheese - Samosa Chana Chat. Brilliant, and filling. For main course I chose Methi Lamb, with a naan, and it was as good a methi as I've had - including in the Punjab. The naan bread was also perfect. In all, a really pleasant meal, and there are so many other dishes I would like to explore on the menu, including some good looking seafood dishes. The chef / kitchen therefore get top marks. The front of house lets the place down however. 1.the welcome was underwhelming. This was very early evening and I watched the two waiters standing around at the edge of the tables as potential clients passed by - they didn't engage eye contact. 2. Table napkins - as opposed to small, thin, paper napkins would make such a difference. If you can wash table cloths, you can wash napkins. 3. I had finished a first beer, and would like another. Neither of the servers recognised this, and walked past my table repeatedly, ignoring me. I think they were just not interested. 4. I had ordered a starter, and a main. I had only half finished the starter when the main arrived. I needed to keep it warm by covering the pot with the naan bread. It is the servers responsibility to inform the kitchen when dishes are needed. I have never been presented with a stater and main together. 5. At the end of the meal I was not offered a dessert or coffee. Would I return for a meal? Yes - the food is great. I would however be very direct with the waiter about what I expect. I also hope that the owner - who I think was sitting at another table drinking run and coke, looks at the training of the front of house staff. There is a menu available on line, at shishmahal.com.sgI hope that this review will be helpful

Great food.. North Indian food was just like back home. The service was nice .. the best part was it was quite close to the Albert court hotel. Ambience was very welcoming as well.

Absolutely delicious meal, freshly cooked and service with a smile - a little gem - no wonder it's still going strong after 18 years!

This restaurant in the courtyard outside the Albert Court Hotel is a very pleasant place to relax on a warm Singapore evening. On our second visit we particularly enjoyed a barbecued chicken dish which had a lovely smoky flavour to go with the Indian spices.

Very tasty North Indian food. Loved the chicken, paneer dishes and yes the dal tadka was very tasty. As we stayed at Village hotel Albert court it was very convenient. Loved the outdoor seating ambience in the European style courtyard.

In SG its difficult to find a good North Indian Restaurant. But this place is a gem.
We stayed in Albert Court HOtel and had our dinners here. I was surprised to see such wonderful Indian Food. Just the taste of Home Abroad

We dove in this restaurant after arriving on a late flight into Singapore; it was a real find. In a cute little semi covered patio next to the Albert Court Hotel, the Shish Mahal served us some tasty dishes and a refreshing jug of Tiger. Tandoori and Chicken curry were very nice, naan breads excellent. Just the job. Would return if fancied Indian food again.

Shish Mahal is one of the many Indian restaurants in the Little India-Farrer Park area, but it easily has the best ambiance among all of them. The outdoor seating is a plus. The service was very warm and waiting time was short, which made the experience all the more pleasant. We had the Garlic Naan, Aloo Paratha, Mahal Special Methi Paneer (the gravy could've been more flavoursome, it fell a little flat), and the Kumbh Masala. The food was nice and homely, minimum oil and food colouring, it was a satisfying meal. The prices for the curries are a little high particularly considering the portions aren't all that big. However, it's worth a visit

We chanced upon this restaurant while looking for options to eat around Albert Court hotel.....I liked the ambience of the place....beautiful setting in the open which is quite a treasure in concretised singapore.....We order only starters and soup and the food was good. It wasn't mind blowing but was good..... there were no spoilers and we liked the menu much.....there is Indian as well as Nepali cuisine to choose from. We will definitely return to eat a main course some time. The service was good and the staff was responsive. If you are sitting inside there could be mosquito's under the table (my wife found one...).... I think this must be the only place in singapore which serves very good Indian style cream of tomato soup and Nepali cuisine...

Nice Punjabi food. Liked the taste and ambiance. Reasonably priced. It was very close to the Parc Sovereign hotel where I was staying. Both veg and non veg dishes were good.
5
Just try it! Food was great! The garlic naan is the best I've ever tasted, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting

Eat in here as we were staying in the hotel opposite,very nice food reasonably priced for singapore, service was quick and friendly and the beer cold.

Had lunch and the roti sabzi tasted authentic. Expensive though. Roti was a wheat one and not maida that was good. Dal tadka and the planner butter masala were again tasty and authentic.

Nice place, in the Albert Court Complex. Reasonable fare. Good options. They have Nepali cuisine menu too. One can dine outside during cool evenings.

The food was very bland, I've had better curries at fast food indian restaurants. The paneer pakora were deep fried and did not have any taste, they brought us ketchup! The saffron rice did not have any saffron and was just orange colored.

Good value thalis and curries till late at night. Excellent food. Close to ibis hotel. Nice terrace in pedestrian street. Made us pay 30¢ for our refreshment towels, which seems rather petty (we hadn't ordered them). Friendly and attentive staff.

I came alone and had the fish curry with fruit and nuts (14 ish) with garlic naan bread (2.90). Both were really good, but I found the curry to be off the charts amazing. If you are on a budget, the portions are large enough to split a dish. I had a feeling it was going to be good when I walked up, saw that it was quite crowded compared to the surrounding restaurants, and noticed that most of the clientele were Indian. I was not disappointed :)

Went there first for dessert and tea only which was nice. Next day went for dinner. The person who appeared to be the owner was very pleasant but once we were seated, we were basically ignored - no one ever came by and asked how things were. The service was slow considering there was only one other party there especially when we didn't get our raita and after asking twice, we didn't get it until almost finished the meal .Very big menu selection including a buffet and the food was good but nothing special and compared to what one can get in nearby Little India, nowhere near as good. If you want a white tablecloth place with atmosphere, this is a nice place but you are paying for it in the pricing which is high - seems like everything is a la carte. We thought the warm cloths provided for washing ones hands was a really nice touch until we looked at the bill and they had charged 30 cents extra for that which really isn't much money but VERY TAWDRY AND CHEAP. Would not recommen

Too nice food. The chicken was delicious. The weather on 18th december was having thunderstorm in Singapore but still I managed to get all the food without any hassle and in this huge rains I got the hot food and also the service we look for on normal day
