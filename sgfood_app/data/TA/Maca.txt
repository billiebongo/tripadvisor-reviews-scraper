The menu focuses on tapas and sashimi. Food items are quite commonly found and not tough to duplicate at home if you can get the ingredients. Taste good but not a wow!

The food came a little slow as there was a big crowd but food is good. Worth the wait. A nice place to chill.

The food was pretty good. Appetizers were delicious. Fish was good. Chicken was flavorless. They didn't have our chope reservation. Service was super slow and they forgot two items all together.

Have had a delicious lunch, love the Plum Tomato Ceviche, grilled Hamachi Collar and miso ginger chicken.

Excellent food and service. The food was very creative and very well presented. The service was outstanding as they were very attentive and fully explained the dishes. We'd definitely go back.

please update your site!!!! i went to this restaurant yesterday and was shocked that it was no longer the fine modern european dining i was expecting from your site but a casual dining "mor mor izakaya"? apparently this change occurred last week because the chef left! i made this reservation on the 23rd for a birthday lunch on the 24th yet nowhere was this change made known on your site then despite being already 1 week since restaurant changed and the menu completely irrelevant! such an embarrassing and stressful moment for me when I realized that the spot i picked based on menu and category "romantic date" was no longer the same kind of place! it makes me less confident about using your booking site :( :( :

I was invited to Maca by a client who lives in Singapore, bringing his wife with him. They are regulars and wanted me to try the food during my short trip to Singapore.The menu is very inviting, with an eclectic mix of lead and supporting cast members in every dish. The mode is all about small sharing plates, which fortunately means that it's possible to try a good part of the menu.On eating the food, Maca immediately reminded me of a restaurant I'd been to in Denia, Spain. Beautifully cooked food, with amazingly inventive flavours hits you fast, demanding you to eat more and more.We had Padron Peppers, Chargrilled Baby Octopus, Scallops, Roast Pigeon, and Venison Tartare for starters, but really those menu headlines don't give the food the presence they deserve - just look at the pictures on the website, because it's all about all the supporting ingredients and little touches.For main, Pan Fried Barramundi, Slow Cooked Iberica Pork Collar, Charcoaled Beef, and Hasselback Potatoes.All washed down with a beer and some Sake.Highly recommended - and must be a step outside of what else is doing it for people in Singapore

This was an interesting dinner with some bold flavor pairings in the menu. The execution was a little suspect on some dishes. At almost 100 dollars / pax for dinner (includes 1 beer) this was certainly not cheap. There are better options in the market. The service was excellent. Largest let-down was the ambience. The stark rock walls reflect sound too well. It was our poor luck to be seated near a boisterous group so it made conversation difficult at our table

Service was great and the food was great with the different ingredients having well balanced with each other. What needs more work perhaps is that the menu is short - prob 20 items (including desserts) and the day I dined, there were some products that weren't available hence making choices even more limited. Servings are on the smaller sizes

We enjoyed the food ! The service was also very good. Will definitely return! Love the chargrilled baby octopus n beef!

5 month old but shows great potential. The salt roasted beetroot was awesome! We fell in love with the dried laksa semifreddo. That was totally wicked.
Music can be improved.

Just came for lunch. Was absolutely impressed with quality of food and service. Easy going and friendly place with fantastic food.

Loved the appetisers. Only grouse if any was acoustics which made the place convivial. Noise level was high such that we had to strain to hear the waiters. But the food more than made up for it.

Fantastic food, and one of the best service team I've ever encountered. It's my second time at MACA & it won't be my last!

Have been to this restaurant for dinner with friends and for weekend lunches with the kids. The food is exceptional, in terms of quality, technique and value. There are very few restaurants that can go from being a very grown-up evening restaurant with a modern menu at dinner to a laid back family restaurant (with largely the same menu) at lunch. There is no children's menu as such but they have a battered barramundi and a small steak, both served with roasted potatoes, that kids (and greedy parents) love. The menu is online. It looks and is very modern but at the same time manages to feel like comfort food (the weekend menu duck and waffles is shameless comfort food and brilliant with it). A great combination of style and substance. The wine list is solid and well-priced.

Just had dinner there on 1 Nov 2015.Small but cozy restaurant with a nice ambience, cuisine with their authentic concoction and a most friendly and customer-oriented crew to match !! The chef-recommended dinner set is worth trying, so is their charcoal-grilled ribeye steak.Thanks Irene, Kars and Chef Rishi for a great dinner time ! :) We will be back

We noticed this restaurant last week in passing and it looked interesting. As close friend was visiting we booked for lunch today. They were closing but kept the kitchen open for us. For delectable, scrumptious food, in my opinion the Maca experience was was second only Heston Blumenthat's Fat Duck. To say it exceeded expectations is an understatement. We shared padron peppers, beef tartare, baby sweetcorn and octopus on the recommendation of the friendly and helpful servers, Kars and Ayu.. Each dish was exceptional. We followed with Duck & waffle, pan fried barramundi and Iberico pork collar,and although completely full by this time we shared grilled rhubard and coconut semifreddo, ambrosial. all ambrosial This is a collaberation betweenthe charismatic IreneChow and Rishi, the talented and knowledgeable chef deserves to succeeed. Sunday brunches start in November - we will be there. Next week we will also try the reasonably priced set lunch. If you love food I would urge a visit

Terrific service: attentive and responsive. Food was just as impressive, scoring high in both creativity and balance of flavours. We were even treated to extra surprise of complimentary off-the-menu dessert — served by chef personally — as well as glass of dessert wine for each diner in our party.Our only complaints: restaurant was very noisy, impossible to hold much of any decent conversation due to hard surface. The presence of a squealing toddler did not help. Perhaps age limit for children should be considered? Otherwise, keep up the great work, Maca.

What a find! Small eclectic restaurant at the bottom of the old Post Office building along Tanglin Road that served fine fresh creations. Must try the padron peppers, chargrilled octopus with smoked miso, beef tartare with salted egg yolk and green apple - and these are just the appetisers! My favourite main is the duck and waffle with a 5-spice caramel sauce. The Iberico pork collar was tender and juicy. For dessert, try the coconut semifreddo with laksa leaf ice cream and pomelo, and wash it down with a peony tea. Service was prompt and responsive. Highly recommended. Only one small area that could be improved. The sound resonates in this compact space and it might do better with some mufflers like carpets or upholstery on the walls.
