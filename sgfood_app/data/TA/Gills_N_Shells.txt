Very courteous and thoughtful staff ( a special mention to Gan) and a very tasty meal before a long flight home. Would recommend to anyone travelling in Singapore.

We had seafood and steak. Steak was nice but not quite what I am used to in Australia....more like a chop than a steak....but it was tasty nonetheless

Stumbled upon this place early on in the night. Had great service from staff and management to accommodate two young kids. No issues to mention at all and would definitely return to enjoy drinks and atmosphere.

I went downstairs from my hotel to get some food. Seemed like a good ambience. Some guy approached me from leaning against the railing to offer me a menu. I understand casually dressed staff, but I had no way to tell he worked there.Marinara was ok, but a bit salty, brought out without any breads, the cutlery was self-serve, felt very basic.When I had finished the meal and bill, I looked around for either of the two people that had served me, both were leaning against the railing outside, on their phones again

It sure ispretty and great for chasing away your monday blues. Happy Hour timingat Gills N Shells is from 3pm-8pm, going from $9 Nett for their fullpint beers.2. 1/2 Dozen Baked Oysters $25.90- Choice of Bacon Cheese Herbs Tomato Sauce or Chef's Specialty SauceI really enjoyed the baked cheese, bacon and herbs on the oysters. Itcreated a crusty exterior with a cheesey, gooey texture on the inside,which added lots of flavour to the oyster.3. Spicy Buffalo Fog LegsThese frog legs are sourced from Vietnam, whereby the frogs arebigger than those farmed in Singapore. They are also pretty meaty. Thefrog legs were succulent and juicy. The spiciness was closer towardsthe sweet side and I really enjoyed the lingering sweetness.4. Clams & Mussels- Spicy White Wine Clear Broth with Herbs, Garlic Onions & Chilli or Smokey Herb Tomato Garlic Sauce. Served with Focaccia Toast.The clams and mussels here are sourced from Myanmar. The toast here is made from scratch and sure tasted so. It was crisp on the edges and not too buttery. It added a nice crunch to this dish. The broth was flavourful and yet not too salty. Definitely a great option to start off your meal with!5. Maine Lobster $28.90- Grilled with Spicy Herb Garlic Butter & served with fresh garden greens.The fact that this Lobster travelled so far from Boston, shows Gills N Shell's passion in delighting your palate with the taste of their ocean-inspired dishes. The lobster meat tasted okay, I wouldn't say it tasted as good as the ones I had in Boston, but let's be realistic, we're 10,000 miles away from Boston. With the ambiance of Gills N Shells, this lobster is so much more enjoyable. Not to mention, the fries that weren't too salty!6. Truffled Infused Cod $24.90- Chef's Special Creation. Succulent cod pan-fried, baked and topped with braised preserved radish.Seeing radish on a pan-fried cod, definitely not a common sight, or combination anywhere. Quality here definitely compensates quantity. The fish was fresh and tasted better than expected. Even though I'm not a fan of radish, it provides an earthly flavour that I was savouring bit by bit. It was good! Definitely worth another visit for this dish!7. Hae-Bee-Hiam Pasta with Soft Shell Crab $18.90This pasta is not for the faint hearted. The noodles were harder in texture with an extra factor, Hae-Bee-Hiam! The noodles were evenly tossed to provide each mouthful, a flavourful and aromatic experience. The soft shell crab was sizeable but a tad too salty for my liking. A downside of this dish, it was too oily for my liking and too spicy. For majority of spicy-food lovers, this would probably be a BIG hit for you. Nevertheless, substantial portion and a flavourful note was definitely worth the indulgence.8. Grilled Tiger Prawn with Salted Egg Pasta $18.90Served with numerous tiger prawns along with an assortment of spices and salted egg, the pasta was able to retain it's chewiness along with the flavours from the various ingredients. This Asian fusion dish had the right ratio of noodles to ingredients that carried off a tinge of spice and shiok salted egg buttery aftertaste. The combination of salted egg, spices and prawns was a wining factor and pleasant sensation to my taste buds.9. Salmon Burger $17.90Served with Housemade teriyaki sauce, this huge serving of salmon is sure to satisfy your salmon cravings. The end result of pan frying this salmon, crispy, thin salmon skin along with tender, melt in your mouth salmon. The flavour from the housemade teriyaki sauce provides a savoury umami flavour to the burger. The burger buns are also said to be made in-house from scratch.10. Roasted Stuffed Chicken $18.90- Stuffed chicken leg roasted with fresh herbs and cream cheese.Glistering brown chicken leg skin is what made this dish look so irresistible. Elsewhere, the flavour of the chicken was missing, along with the stuffing?11. Gills N Shells Tiramisu Jar $10.90Served in a rather tall jar for it's serving size is Gills N Shells home made Tiramisu. Melts in your mouth instantly and it is so smooth and creamy. If you close your eyes, I bet one would think that this is Tiramisu ice cream! Not a bad way to end your meal by the Rochor River

I had prime rib, my husband Cajun salmon. Both delicious. Washed down with draught Guinness. Moderately priced, friendly staff. The only drawback, no menu or starter items for a child.

The food was excellent, particularly the Hae Bee Hiam soft shell crab pasta is a must try. Kudos to the chef for creating such a unique dish! The restaurant is located by a canal and furnished with wooden tables - great for chilling out in the middle of a busy city. The service however can be improved. It was difficult to catch the waiters and waitresses attention and our food was cleared before we finished it
