I always come back here for a good burrito.
Portion is big and worth the price.
Good takeaway snack without burning the wallet.
Staffs are always giving their best service.

I just ordered a chicken burrito at this location. The burrito was tasteless. In fact, I threw it away. In addition, we weren't allowed to sit down in the food court to eat as this food stall apparently does not qualify for its patrons to sit down at the food court that it is located in. ??? There is nowhere else to sit down and I prefer to sit while eating. Try another food vendor at this City Square location instead

Stuff'd is fantastic!! I bring my own container and they make my salad in it. I usually go for a Mexican style salad, while my kids love the burritos. My daughter prefers adding hummus over guacamole which gives her burrito a more Mediterranean flavor. I love this place because I can eat slow-car, Four-hour Body style by going with the salad and adding beans and corn - no rice. We've tried both the chicken and the beef and prefer the chicken. Healthy and filling! Thanks Stuff'd for letting us use our containers and avoid plastic! My only request is that they start offering delivery through Food Panda to help us fulfill our cravings for Stuff'd

Servings in Stuff'd are definitely not for single serving. They are heavy on the tummy, so sharing is recommended. Our latest order of burrito and daily bowl were so loaded with different ingredients (which you can freely select), it must have weighed a couple of pounds.Try beef filling for the burrito and chicken for the daily bowl. Tasty and healthy at the same time

Stuff'd is a mexican turkish kebab/salad/burrito store that has earned its place in my heart as one of my default and go to places for a simple and fast lunch during my daily work hours. In recent years, my need for a healthier lunch option has grown quite a bit and it was fortunate that i discovered this little gem near my workplace. It started in City Square mall and has now grown its franchise to 13 outlets strong and most likely setting up even more. My usual choice there will be the Chicken Burrito Bowl($6.80) or the Chicken Burrito($6.80) itself and what i love about it is how fresh the food tastes. The burrito and burrito bowl comes with a base of lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cucumbers to start follow by 2 sauces. My usual combination sauce will be the honey musturd and bbq or tomato ketchup. This is followed by choosing the meat/protein, which is the marinated chicken. The chicken is grilled on the spot daily and you can see it being grilled on the big turnstile on the store front of all their outlets. Next up, you choose more items to complete your meal, the choices you have here will be black beans, couscous, corn, rice and mashed potatoes. I usually go for the corn, couscous and mashed potatoes as you can see in the picture.And there you have it, the perfect bowl or burrito of happiness and all for $6.80. Yes, i know that the price has increased slightly over the years as i was one of the early supporters but still, you can ask for additional servings of corn or potatoes, couscous or rice at no additional cost. The servings are still generous and the food is still delicious. So i'm ok with the current price. Compare their price with other salad outlets and there is no competition. Having worked in town before, you cannot find another place selling salads or similar food at this price, its easily double for the same and less food. So, all i can say is, this is currently my favorite salad/burrito place and will continue to be so as long as the quality stays, the friendliness of the staff stays and the option to have more toppings stays without additional cost. Hopefully, they come up with a way to use less plastic in their burrito bowls or allow us to bring our own recyclable packaging and this would be one place i would always come back to

workplace discrimination should not be cordoned. went earlier to bugis and this lady tiera was having attitude problem and just started at her colleague and rolled eyes at him, who did not have a good understanding of english language while i was ordering. i paid and went to pick up other stuff, but when i was back she did not do my order at all. then the cashier guy cutting chicken gave me uncooked chicken just because there were many people waiting, giving me the runs. how could he gave my order to someone else who came later.. crappy service DO NOT VISIT BUGIS branch at 7-9p

Stuff'd is so delicious it's addictive! Every time I go to City Square Mall for my dental appt, I just gotta have my burrito salad bowl . The portions are usually generous and you can even top up with black beans, cilantro rice, buttered corn and mash potatoes. Thai sweet dressing is my favorite. Costs between$6.90-$8.90 (for those with meat). My kids usually have the quesadillas or burrito (wrapped) which is nicely toasted. But it's so humongous the wrap unfortunately , unravels / comes apart quite easily. It's a messy eat so prepare your hankies / wipes! The only problem is there is no seating area. TIP1: no place to sit? Go to 4th floor food court for free seating. TIP2: don't want the mess and prefer less carbs? Go for the burrito bowl!

Stuff'd offers one of the best burritos I have eaten. The filling inside the wrap is generous, and number of possible permutations of sauce, sides, etc. are very good.Stuff'd works as a take-away model, wherein there are no seats to eat your order, as soon as it is prepared. This means that one has to either eat cold burritos or re-heat them once they find a place to eat; either of the option is not good

The burrito has potato option instead of rice, that was peculiar. Generous filling of meat and veggies. The sauce was delicious though not special.

This is my first time having such a fat quesadilla which i thought it is burritos. It would be my first and last. Not fantastic.

Went here for lunch.... Really nice fresh meat and also vegetables. Great value for money and tasted delicious! Would defiantly eat here again

I have been at this place (Bedok Mall) 4 times. Have tried kebabs, burrito and Quesadilla. Food is very good and choice of toppings and servings is nice as well. Service is quick and warm.Strongly recommend the place for anyone who is looking for mid range Mexican food

I went to branch at Vivo Mall for dinner. I knew I had to try it since I saw the HALAL logo. My husb ordered spicy beef burrito. Its huge & spicyyy! I tried chicken kebab & the chicken really tasty. They also serve quesadilla. The price for all menu are less than $10 - cheap! Thanks to Nita, your service was exceptional

If you're longing for yummy burritos yet don't want to burn a hole in the wallet, this is the place to go. You can customise each and everything in the burrito. They have a nice spread of sauces, most notable being hanbero. They offer only take away option, but I really don't mind the wait until I ride back home to sit back and relish the food!

We loved the chicken burrito that we tried out from Stuff'd. It was healthy, filly and tasted amazing. I was unable to finish mine off. The staff are friendly especially the boys who made our burritos. They were helpful when selecting sauces and other ingredients. Will definitely go here again when we visit Singapore

Started patronising this outlet right after they were halal-certified. Before the certification, I have always seen a long queue. Therefore, that triggered the curiosity cat in me to try out their food. Much to my surprise, the Beef Burrito which I got was tasty. If you are not sure what dressings go well, the staff were really helpful with suggestions. It was also appropriately priced compared to other joints that are around. Its a good place to have a tasty and healthy snack or meal especially for anyone on the go

I am reviewing the Tampines branch of Stuff'd which isn't yet on Trip Advisor.Though not the most authentic Mexican/Turkish food, we found Stuff'd to be tasty and appetising.We chanced upon this take away counter while walking around the basement of Tampines Mall one day. Had it once and returned for more.Both of us had a chicken burrito. It comes with 2 sauces, with a choice to add some others at a $1 cost, which we gladly for the flavourful guacomole. You can even add 3 sides to the burrito at the end.They also sell kebabs, burrito bowls and quesadilla

I tried chicken burrito at Stuff'd today, and to be honest the burrito did not really taste like burritos. I think the chicken seasoning isn't made for a burrito, since the shop sells both kebabs ( shawarma) and burrito so i guess they just have one type of grilled chicken that will serve both kebab and burrito. It just doesn't work this way, since changing the sauce isn't sufficient
