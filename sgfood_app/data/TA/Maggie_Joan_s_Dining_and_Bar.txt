In a hard to find back alley entrance. Nice, decently romantic atmosphere. With great service! Good food!
3
Missed the old menu with cucumber promigrate and that yummy pork. New set menu not that inspiring. The lamb could be better.
2
I had been to MJ several times in its earlier days, and thought the overall dining experience was amazing. I returned for a repeat visit though was disappointed with the food (safe but very average), and service and attentiveness can be improved.
5
Mysterious door way to resturant and good food. Unique dish and flavours that is certainly to leave an impressio
3
Papadelle with lamb ragout needed bit more sauce and felt too meaty. The pumpkin risotto was really good and perhaps should have that as main.
5
Fantastic little gem ~ and I’m not easily impressed. Far better than Lolla. Surprised reviews are so mediocre! Warm friendly maitre d’ showed is through to a quiet and cosy table just by the kitchen. Contrary to reviews posted it was actually quite chilly~ maybe theyve whacked up the aircon in response to everyone complaining that theyre hot. Maitre d’ seemed concerned about us expecting the ‘old’ menu~ but we loved all the items on this ‘new’ menu and its always nice to shake things up a bit! Why not allow a restaurant to show off their creativity rather than serving the same old thing time and again? Food was simple and delicious, great flavour pairings. We had olives, the baked taleggio with warm fluffy sourdough and beef fat butter, a fresh cold zucchini salad w feta and nut brittle, a good sized melt in your mouth steak grilled perfectly rare, and the potato and egg yolk raviolo~ which had magically sharp pickled girolles to cut through the creaminess. Everything was super yum~ paired with attentive but not intrusive service. So full we couldnt fit in dessert which was a shame as they looked good!! Loved the final flourish of a box of two mini choc chip cookies that came with the bill. Can’t wait to come back~ highly recommended, think this will become our new go to!

I went for Lunch meeting and they have this set menus which you can choose 2 or 3 courses. I felt the price was reasonable and the food was quite authentic, it was not those dishes where you can eat them any places. Food was delicious but it was a bit salty and that is the only reason I cannot give 5 stars.Location is near the Club Street which is one of the hot spot in Singapore.Restaurant is not that big, so you'd better reserve the place before you go
5
Not easy to find, but well worth the trip, food was fabulous, I had the courgette and feta salad and it was quite simply delicious. My friends all enjoyed their meals with the Burrata and plums along with the escabeche coming out on top.Maggie Joan's was recommended by a friend in a Singapore for our visit, and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone
3
Ambience - cozy and relaxFood - something different from the norm. The fish dishes needs working on. Second time there and tried the fish on both occasion it has a fishy taste to it, not my cup of tea. Love the starters.Seating - would choose to sit away from the open kitchen as it gets too Smokey and busy.Staff - They tried their best but think on busy nights they need to add on extra waiting staff.Overall great experience to try something different and love the way the entrance is from a back lane.
5
I have just located to Singapore from London for work and visited Gemmil's, which is a stone's throw away from my office. I cannot commend the staff enough for their professionalism and kindness. Huda provided charming and friendly service, while Darren ensured that our glasses of prosecco (on tap!) were never empty. We will definitely be back soon
5
Was a tricky find! While the address says Amoy St, the entrance is from the alley way parallel to Amoy St. but the food there was well worth the confusion in finding the place. Loved everything we chose. Will definitely come back again.
3
The food was, as usual, good but the service needs to be improved vastly. They seemed to be short of staff and the restaurant wasn't even full.
4
Delicious food, great menu selection, cool vibes, friendly service, worth your dollar! Will return. Not suitable for big groups
3
Small, cosy restaurant. Do request for a table away from the open kitchen. We were seated opposite it and it was too warm for our liking. Side dishes were better than the mains. Portions were small too.
5
You don’t need a menu. The friendly waitress will let you know what is best and what is the off menu special for the day
5
Great atmosphere with attentive service. Friendly team and very good entertainment. A deservedly very food reputation. Well worth a visit.
3
Cool hole in the wall restaurant and staffs were professional. I adore the concept of a short menu as it gives me the perception that everything on it will be fantastic. However, the dishes on the menu were simplistic and did not whet my appetite.I had the burrata, barramundi and the steak. A tad disappointing as only the burrata dish was good. The steak was laden with fats and although I love fats on my meat, the steak was tough, stringy and the fats did not melt in my mouth
4
I had lunch with a colleague on a weekday. Maggie Jones is hidden away in the back lane - the address is misleading and it is hidden behind a door. The restaurant was quite quiet at lunch. We had the set menu of S$30 for two courses. Service was ok but with a bit of attitude. The tomato tart entree was good but the salmon was small (although good). The restaurant was unfortunately very warm. Overall good for a quiet lunch
5
From start to finish Maggie Joan's knocked it out of the park. Coming off a disappointing experience at National Kitchen, we were very pleasantly surprised by our experience at Maggie Joan's. It's tucked away down a side street and is quite small but exudes charm through and through. We started with some cocktails which were delicious, and then moved on to a salad appetizer and main courses. All the food was very flavorful and really hit the spot. Our waitress was funky in a very warm and friendly way. She made a couple recommendations when we were having trouble deciding and was spot on (although really we probably would have bene happy with any of the above). Overall it was an outstanding meal, probably the best of our trip. I would definitely return here again if we're in Singapore in the future
4
Came back to Gemmill's (part of Maggie Joan's and located next door) for another lunch visit this week with a friend. This time I opted for one of the sandwiches and then had a coffee to follow. Both were quite decent. The coffee was just the right strength for my taste. I like the hidden location in Gemmill Lane also
5
Fun ambience, mix crowd. The environment is unpretentious yet not entirely laid back. Chef bothered to serve 1 dish personally. Food is great!
5
Fantastic food and great service. Got an outside table so can’t speak for the restaurant itself but from what I saw it looked great, nice decor and a cosy ambience.
5
Chef Ollie runs a tight ship in Maggie Joan's-- food is topnotch, staff is attentive, the experience is what every dining experience should be like. Try the squid ink appetizers!!!
4
The menu was simple and the food good. The atmosphere is understated yet elegant. The cocktails had a twist but nothing too crazy. Had a great time!
4
Great ambience, good food, and attentive customer service in small restaurant tucked away in back alley near Telok Ayer.
5
Every dish was perfectly executed. The apple tartin was the best thing that night! Small kitchen crew, but they were machines! The food came out so quickly! So impressed. Service was so so nice, they let us stay past closing time, and were so patient, attentive, funny, and accomadating with our endless requests (they even charged my friend's phone!!!). Couldn't ask for a better experience. Thank you
5
The nondescript door on a backalley hides an excellent and cool small restaurant. Great to go with partner and friends. The lamb was fantastic, but honestly think the vegetarian rigatono was the best of the night! Service was equally good and price was very affordable for what it is. Guess the only think to watch out is ensuring you book a table, cause it gets full. Will certainly go back
5
Maggie Joanâ€™s was recommended by restauranteur when we were unable to book a table at his restaurant due to a party. An awesome recommendation. We chose the shared dinner set and over 7 wonderful courses were treated to a variety of flavours, styles and texture. The portions were just the right size and the flavours were incredible. The restaurant was busy and lively with mainly very attentive staff with great recommendations. Will definitely be back.
5
Came here few times and always get great services, especially from Nic-the super fun staff! :)The latest visit we got the pork shoulder and the baramundi main foods.. soo yummy!!!!We had some appetizers while waiting for the main foods to come - the squid is highly recommended! so addictive, I ended up having 3 portions of It! lol. the desserts are also the star! especially the Paris-Brest chocolate... and the Apple pie with vanilla ice cream.. super yum!they also have good collections of white wine too!
5
Went there in a party of 5, so we were able to share many tastes.1st impression - really interesting vibe, atmosphere but not overloud (I am of the older generation!) - welcoming. Great staff.The dishes were outstanding - the taramasalata with squid ink nori was one of the best tastes ever (and I mean "tastes" - it's not something to share! And that is NOT a criticism; order 1 per person.). So too was the crab "sandwich" (perhaps better described as a slider) - crammed full of crab meat and flavour.Although I'm not a vegetarian, I ordered the potato/egg ravioli, as I was meated out from too many airline meals. It was outstanding - superb flavour and texture, and superbly satisfying.Did I say the staff were great?The wine list is well-chosen, and by SG standards, reasonably priced. If you look beyond the well known areas, there's great drinking and reasonable value (excellent value for SG!) to be found.I think I've discovered my eating place of choice in Singapore.As an aside - a little later, on business, I ate alone at a Michelin starred restaurant in Tokyo. The bill for one was substantially higher than the bill for 5 at MJ's, in part due to the wine. The kicker however is that the food at MJ's was much much better. I wouldn't eat again at the place in Tokyo. I'll be eating at MJ's every time I'm in SG.The only downside was that there was no room for dessert
5
Chef Oliver Hyde creates interesting and good food in his tiny kitchen behind the hidden entrance to Maggie Joan's.
5
What a great find this was. Nice wine list and scrumptious food. I'll be back for sure. Good for small groups or intimate dinner for 2.
3
Front of house staff were excellent and very friendly. Can't fault that aspect. The food however was below par. I thought the menu was limited. Not as good as previous occasions.
4
cozy place and we went for lunch and celebrate my friend's birthday.
the wine there also nice for drinking. will visit again
5
Great vibe and delicious food. Oliver has brought out very amazing dishes. This place is a hidden gem. Service was friendly and well prep.
4
The place a little bit tricky to find and a little bit small for big groups booking but the food is great!
4
Good food based on quality produce alrhough it doesn't make you soar with joy. The Ambiance is low key, but inviting. Service was fine as well on this my third visit.
5
I had the opportunity to visit the cafe for Maggie Joan's for lunch today, known as Gemmills and located next door. Great lunch deals available here. I opted for the prosciutto sandwich whilst my lunch companion chose the lamb lasagna. We each had a drink and icecream and the cost was quite reasonable. Definitely worth another visit.
4
The menu is limited, the price a bit on the high side but if you're looking for something different then try it. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Food portions are small no doubt but are really of good quality. The ambience is warm and different. Seating capacity is limited so make reservations. Tables are close to the kitchen so its slightly noisy but if you can get over that than this place is a winner
5
Everything was excellent, service, food, ambience, plus anyone who serves me my Iberico medium rare is certainly my hero!! You know that the food is good when you have that lingering dance of flavour fairies on your palate, the next day still!! Will definitely visit again if in Singapore.
5
Went over to Maggie Joan's last Sat (4 Aug) and was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, service and best of all the food.
4
Loved it here! Awesome vibe and the food and drinks are really good. Great service and friendly staff
5
Love this place. Small restaurant with yummy creative food. Not a huge menu but what's on it does not disappoint.
5
The ambience of the restaurant was cosy, maybe a little too cosy as the table set-up was too close to one another. Regardless, the food and service was great!
5
Fabulous food. Great atmosphere!! Would go definitely go again. A little tricky to find as you'll need to go in through the back alley.
5
I had the best lamb and beef tartar ever in this place. it's so hidden make it a great place to have a date or cozy dinner with close friends! will definitely want to visit again! delightful service too
5
This was our first visit to Maggie Joan's and it won't be our last. The setting of the restaurant is dark and intimate due to its furnishings and hence makes a lovely spot for a date night.We shared several starters and had a main dish each, both fish. All of the dishes were prepared and presented to a very high standard but it was the staff who really sold it for us. They were warm, friendly and extremely attentive. A real gem of a place.Try the sourdough and beef fat butter, you won't be disappointed
5
I've never seen a menu as interesting as theirs for a long time. Their starters stole the show; the grilled peach on burrata, and the black rice risotto, were finely handled with complementing tastes. Though I thought my barramundi was average, my family was raving about how tender the poached chicken was
4
Was surprised that the place was empty on a Fri evening. But that works out for our group of 6. Portions are small so you'll need to order plenty to share. I'd say we ordered almost everything on the menu. Not disappointed with the food but do wish the portions are larger. Even though the place was almost empty, service was lacking. The saving grace is the quality cuisine
5
The cosy tucked away location makes the experience even more unique. You almost forget to be in Singapore. The food is stunning and the portions are decent. We had a little miss communication about one of the dishes ordered. But without any doubts we were offered to replace it. Wine was great!! Definitely recommend this place, just hope it won't become too populair ;
4
It's a great concept with a lot of potential. However, the service was pretty bad. Took ages to get out drink orders etc. The food was hit or miss. Didn't like the beef fat butter. Beef cheeks and octopus were tasty.
5
Cozy little restaurant behind a shophouse. Some look but do not see this nice place. Food is good and servic is superb
5
Head round the back alley to Maggie Joan's and be ready to have your tastebuds enticed. Attentive staff and really quick to be served that sea salt or drink that you've asked for.
4
Innovative food ideas yet yummy. It's not easy to find at first, you can tell they had put a good effort on their food and wine
4
If you're looking for something unique to tantalize your palate, this is the place for you. A fusion menu with great flavours. I like the entrance from the back alley - like a hidden treasure.
5
Hidden away at the back of Amoy Street behind a very discreet unassuming door and signage, is a gem of a atmosphere. Beautifully lit space affords privacy and ambiance which compliments a menu that is delightful and quite unique. Thoughtful wine selections made for a very enjoyable and memorable evening. In a market where so many restaurants replicate in-vogue dishes, it is wonderful to see Maggie Joan's making her creative mark with real flair! Great menu
5
Everything our group ordered was presented well, cooked perfectly and full of flavour. It was reasonably priced too. Service on Saturday night for the last sitting (taking orders and bringing drinks) was a bit slower than expected but not an issue if you're not in a rush! Air con could be better, it got pretty hot but we were sat by the kitchen. If I lived in Singapore I'd be a regular visitor at this restaurant, it's good European/western food.
4
A cosy and interesting place, located in the latter back half of an elongated conservation house along Amoy St. Hence its entrance via the back lane that ran parallel to Amoy. Food was good (2 of us shared the buratta) including the beef tartare and the lamb pappardelle. The food was not excessively expensive but not the good value set lunches offered by most restaurants in the vicinity.
5
From the discrete alley entrance to the tasty cocktail list, lots of great surprises. Shared lots and tried everything as we made our ways through a varied menu for the small kitchen. Every dish prepared in some unique way and it all worked together to leave us wanting to return.
3
Resturant is very close by to the famous club st of bars and resturants (about 20m). It is a small place done like a speakeasy. The address is the main road but the entrance is hidden in the alley behind the main road and you have to walk around to find an unassuming door with a small grey sign above....past a burger place. Good place for a smart casual dinner date for shall groups. Food is fresh and contemporary western. Nothing very special but service is really thoughtful and not too pricey. The lamb, cod are reccomended mains and there's a squid ink cracker starter that is quite unique and,reminds me of a savoury oreo
4
Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. A bit loud from the music as very small space. Portions fairly small so still hungry after being there. But good quality.
5
Just loved it, if you haven't been yet, get there before it gets crazy busy. Great food, ambience, wine, service, price. Not a bad word to say...
4
Hardly you can find a place that is cosy and quiet during lunchtime around biz district. Good food and service. Most importantly able to enjoy "peace" while having lunch.🙂
4
Came here to celebrate friend's birthday. Wished to have stayed longer but the dining duration was restricted to about 2 hours each sitting.
5
Wine, food, ambiance, service, design, location. Everything is perfect. I recommend you to go there !
4
Great food and drinks. Menu is very interesting, though the place is a little difficult to find. Good service
5
We had a wonderful evening at Maggie Joan's. Really interesting combinations of food. The waiters were very polite, knowledgable and efficient!
5
This restaurant offers modern western fusion type meals. Really love all the food we ordered especially the taleggio with honey and almond and the pork chop. The Apple Tatin was also yummy.They also have a good selection of wine and cocktails. And service is very professional.Can't wait to go back
4
cheese starter dish was yummy and went well with fresh bread. ordered the cod which was served in a cylindrical shape. Overall great service but staff was quite insistent with reminding several times of the 2 hour dining duration limit. portions were medium sized only, so it might not seem value for money.
2
Rarely does food annoy me the way that which is being served at Maggie Joan's did tonight. The whole place - it's all style and no substance. Love the back alley, speakeasy-vibe. The secret dining club. The hipster staff. And the food is beautifully plated. But that's where it stops. An "asparagus tart with blood orange and anchovy" was 4 stalks of asparagus artfully balanced on a cheese cracker. Octopus was expertly grilled and salmon expertly poached, but the accompanying accoutrements, as eye popping-ly colorful as they were, were drowned in lemon. Lemon, lemon, lemon. The chef failed to let the ingredients sing. The chicken liver mousse with rhubarb and cocoa, however, was delicious, presented as a flowering pot of dirt, and the pours of wine generous. I just don't understand this place
3
Granted it was a busy Thursday night, but service was lacking. Food is decent but for the portions, it was quite overpriced. Wine options would be better too (both in variety and prices).
4
Enjoyable experience starting from the unique entrance, the menu walk through and recommendations, right thru to the dessert. The beef cheeks was a tasty dish.
5
Great good, friendly and knowledgeable service. Really enjoyed the atmosphere. The space is very well designed.
5
I couldn't remember what's the name of the food we had for dinner, but all of them were great! From the appetisers, main, and desserts. The service was really good too!
Top notch, definitely will be back again if I visit Singapore.
4
It was my first time to the restaurant. I was with my friend who had been to the restaurant before. She loves the food there so I shan't include her bias in this review. It was lunch and I wanted a light meal. But I was surprised by how light the menu was (it was so limited with regards to choice). I ordered the fish which wasn't what I would order but had to settle given the limited choice. I didn't expect much but was so surprised at how well the fish was cooked. It was really soft and delicious. Yummy. I finished it. But the alcohol wasn't cheap at all. And that was a downer
3
Our friends had raved about Maggie Joan's but my visit was certainly not worth raving about. It's like a crammed pub, sitting shoulder to shoulder with people at other tables, open kitchen and very noisy. Lots of atmosphere if you don't mind that style of dining, but the food absolutely let the place down. All four plates were basic and uninspired. At the prices and given the competition around Club and Amoy streets, I can't imagine why they wouldn't try harder. Won't be back.
5
This restaurant really is a hidden gem. From the outside you do wonder where you are going, but once you open the door and hear the buzz you begin to realise that it's something special. We were welcomed at the door and shown to our table, tucked away but with a good view of the open kitchen and what was going on.We were treated to a tasting menu which chef, Oliver Hyde concocted for us. Great tasting dishes, full of flavour and textures. Among the highlights were the chicken liver parfait with cocoa crumb and mint, salmon and cauliflower cous cous and the octopus with Persian potato salad. The goats cheese with raspberry and sorrel was a fresh and clean desert to finish with.Definitely worth the visit and a highlight of our visit to Singapore
4
This is a good cosy restaurant, serving modern Mediterranean-inspired cuisine on Amoy Street in Chinatown.Their appetizer of Fried Taleggio and Tomato Chutney (SGD9) is wholesome and reminiscent of homestyle food which is heart warmingly good. This is deep-fried cheese which is irresistible as a gourmet vegetarian starter. Their house-baked sourdough bread was great for mopping up any remnant Tomato Chutney.We also ordered their Cured Salmon Tartare with Dill, Cucumber and Yoghurt (SGD17). This soft salmon was really fresh, and melt-in-the-mouth tender.We tried their Fried Chicken sandwich which had Green Harissa coleslaw and Pecorino (SGD18). The deep fried chicken breast was so delicate and flaky that it tasted like fish fillet.Their portions are generous, and we were well satiated.Recommended for a hearty, but different Mediterranean style of cuisine, which is not typical in Singapore.You have to locate this hidden rustic eating place which is at the back alleyways of Amoy Street, and at the cul-de-sac of Gemmill Lane.Service was efficient, but could be friendlier.Next door is their related restaurant Gemmills, which is also owned by the same father and son team behind Moosehead too
3
The place is a little overpriced. We had the bass and beef cheeks. Both were decent but didn't have anything special about them. What was most disappointing was the service. We don't mind if service is slow, we come from a tropical island where everything is slow. But we do appreciate some attention to what we order and the order we get our food. We had reservations at 8PM and the restaurant was mostly full but seemed normal since it is very small. Maybe seats 50. The hostess took us to a table, didn't tell us who our server was. Then, when our server came, she gave us the menus, didn't introduce herself and came back shortly after for our drink orders. We gave drink orders and appetizers. We got our drinks but no appetizers. Meanwhile, another server popped over and took our main dish orders. While waiting for our appetizers, our main dishes were brought over by a third server. After a minute, we flagged the third server down and asked where our appetizers were. Got a very confused look and she ran around to check with the other servers. Came back to verify our appetizer order and then we assume went to put it in at the kitchen. All while this was going on, our table water was never refilled despite two stops by our table as they say empty. To add to the matter, the first server was serving the table next to us and never looked at us again or seemed to recognize we were her table. Perhaps they changed the server, but never mentioned it to us so we knew who to go to for any requests. Not to mention, no one actually asked if we liked our food. I guess they didn't care which is evident in the slightly above average fare served
4
There's a great atmosphere at this place, probably more so in the front room and a good and reasonably priced wine list helps ensure you should enjoy a night out with friends. The menu is interesting, but probably not ideal if you're looking for a light dinner. The pig's head dish really stood out as a starter, whilst the Persian potatoes and Octopus were a really nice surprise as the main course. One tip: if you fancy a drink beforehand then it's good to head to Gemmills next door as they will let you take your drinks through to the restaurant
4
Had Valentine's Lunch here. Food was above average. Atmosphere was nice but service was super slow long wait
5
Place is nice and cosy along an alley. Food is good, staff was attentive. Cocktails were reasonable. But definitely a nice place for couples or not. Can get quite noisy as its small.
5
I've been to Maggie Joan's a few times now and this time I went with out of town friends and had a great seat outside the kitchen to see the team in full force. Fantastic food with some surprising delights such as the Beef Fat butter and the Beef Cheeks were phenomenal. All round a great night out.
3
My wife and I went here for dinner, had to book in advance. Small restaurant with friendly staff, looked good for a romantic evening. I am all for trying new flavors and interesting new combinations of food however about half the items on the menu seemed to be put together for the sake of being different e.g. peas, buttermilk and Parma ham!Regardless we ordered seven starters so we could get a range of flavors. First few arrived promptly but as the restaurant started to fill up service slowed down. Last item did not turn up without much reminding and when it did arrive it was wrong and had to go back, took another 15 mins for the replacement to arrive and it was the afore mentioned peas, buttermilk and ham-just my personal opinion but this combination does not work. Desert took another half hour. Blood orange and white chocolate which was excellent and Earl Grey tea despite my ordering English breakfast! Little in the way of apologies for the dreadful service.Would not go back
5
My wife and I visited last night for a V Day meal and were really impressed with everything we ate. The onion risotto, baked tallegio and pork chop were amazing. Small but excellent wine selection by the glass, with healthy glass size as well. Service was very good by all of the staff and a bill of less than $300 for 3 courses and 3 glasses of wine each was really good value IMO. The only challenge was finding it for the 1st time, but once u know where ur going it's not a problem. We will defo be back soon
4
You really need to do your research to find the entrance. Service was great and attentive, and the food is of good quality. Cocktails are super loaded; one drink and we were a little tipsy. However, the bill was rather steep for the fare, even though it is quality food, we just didn't feel the value for money
5
Went there for husbands BD dinner, he thought that this was one of the best dinners he ever had. Staff was very attentive and helpful. The brought out a little birthday cake slice with a little candle which was really nice. Recommend their ravioli, roasted cauliflower, lamb, beef cheek and tart tatin. Amazing flavours throughout
4
We had been here once before and really enjoyed it. Allow time to find the entrance because it's really hard to find!Nick looked after us - she was very attentive but not over the top. intimate atmosphere. Menu is small but the food was great and we had no problem choosing
4
If you are looking for a place of the beaten track in Singapore this is the place. Great food , great service nice and small and quaint. Relax unwind with some great food and drinks and the service is wonderful. Enjoy your evening out and don't miss this one. Enjoy
5
We were recommended this small restaurant by some friends who live locally. Not so easy to find but others have explained so there is no excuse. The food was tasty and not too heavy, service struck a balance between attentive and not too fussy. A pleasant and intimate atmosphere
5
I wasn't sure what to expect, pleasantly surprise by the food and service. One of the few places I would go back to.
4
Loved how the restaurant only has a little sign outside of the door, felt like I was walking into a secret backyard. Hamachi crudo was amazeballz
5
Cracking little laneway restaurant. Great for date night or a night out with friends. Owner Darren knows his stuff and has his finger on the pulse. Reminds me of some of the best casual diners in Melbourne and is sure to not disappoint.
5
A hidden gem. Great atmosphere and food to match. Food was unique and brilliantly presented. Even the appetisers and sourdough bread was s delicacy. A highlight of our time in Singapore. Will definitely be back next time.
5
Excellent food and ambience. Prices a re reasonable. My friends and i will definitely come again. BEST hidden restaurant in Singapore!
4
Food is surprisingly fun and tasty. More knowledgeable service from the manageress.
Slightly small place with waiters knocking my chair when walking pass but it's ok.
Have fun searching the place.
5
The service was amazing - staff came to collect me from the front of the building! Food was absolutely delicious - lamb shoulder was yummy! Cheesy starters my favourite!!
4
Excellent dessert and service. Loved the sea bass and pork loin - though i wish it to be a lil less heavy handed on spices. The crackers that came with the cheese is also too Indian-ish, but the fig jam was really good. Keep up the good work! Suggest to bring back the freshly baked rosemary focaccia, it was so memorable.
4
The back alley entrance was really interesting,the door to the restaurant didn't even look like u will be entering a restaurant. The hamachi was awesome, sea bass, pork and cheese with honey was so so Gd! However we did felt that the poached eggs was a bit over rated. Will definitely be back for more!
4
Food was very good and very innovative.A great night out with 2 lovely friends.The stuff has been very attentive helping us with some suggestions and giving details about the dishes when those were served.Unluckily the music was a bit too high in volume making it difficult for us to held a nice chat.Except for that, the atmosphere and the place lay-out are great
4
Great food and atmosphere with an attentive staff. Took initiative to arrange for a nice wedge of cake for my son's 15th birthday just by mentioning it in the reservation.
5
Cool concept great atmosphere stellar food and drinks. Will def be back.
Try to get.a seat at the back, when we visited the front of the restaurant seemed warm. Reservations def advised the restaurant was full!
4
An enjoyable evening with friends
Friendly and efficient team
Small menu but well thought out
Food quality good but lacked seasoning
Atmosphere very good although music was a little too club like
Would return
4
Food at Maggie Joan's has always been dependably excellent since the day they opened for business, which is a big plus when I have to entertain guests.
5
This place is worth hunting for. The entrance is unprepossessing, from an alley behind the address on Amoy St. The food is interesting, delicious, and unpretentious. The Mules are pretty darn good, too. Check out the review on Chope for more details.We would happily take serious foody friends here. And they would almost certainly come again
4
Came here for dinner and it didn't disappoint us. A simple menu with great options. Everything we ordered was delicious and well-presented and the prices were reasonable too. A cosy restaurant - conducive to have a conversation over a meal. Had a really relaxing meal and was very happy with the service.
5
If you can manage to find the entrance to this restaurant (via the back alley), this place is a real treat. Generally the quality of restaurants in Singapore is very hit and miss, and eating out as an Expat can be a frustrating experience. Maggie Joan's stand's out from the normal Club Street eating options and was a delight, Great food, drinks and service, with that slightly underground speakeasy vibe. The bread with dripping butter is a must, as well as the chicken liver pat'e. I would highly recommend this place .Enjoy!

We ordered the artichoke starter and it was very good. We had sea bass and riavioli as mains and they were very well presented and delicious. Had dark chocolate with cherry as desert but it was too sweet for my liking. We will definitely go back again.

I had heard good reviews about the place but was let down by the selection from the lunch menu. We shared the salmon tar tar and chick pea with egg appetizer and got the bass and pork loin. The pork was good. Other dishes were average. Cost is 128 including coffee at the end of the meal

Good start to evening, lovely starters and nice wine and great atomsphere. The main courses however were really disappointing. The side dishes were really bad quality. Cold over cooked chips and poor salad something which should be so basic. We left thinking of the bad rather than the good...

What's not to love about Maggie Joan's? Friendly staff, intimate ambience (perfect for date nights) and amazing food. Would definitely dine here again and recommend to all our friends! Love the entrance via gemmil lane :)

Singapore does a lot of tapas etc. Maggie Joan nails it. We shared 5 starters between three of us and each was spectacular. One main each was just as good. A left of field wine list and a small friendly venue. Definitely going back.

First thing to note - the entrance is behind 110 Amoy St via the back alley, so don't get lost! The restaurant has a nice secretive and cosy feel to it because of that. However, when it is full of diners it can get a bit loud with noise bouncing off the walls. And it is almost always full during dinner time because of word of mouth. The cuisine here is exquisitely prepared - love the tomato bread covered with slices of iberico which felt just like Donostia in Spain. I read that their strengths lie in the red meats - probably true as my lamb shoulder was delicious (except for the slight lambiness from the outset) and my friend's sirloin steak too. Get the desserts as well!

Located in the club st area this little hidden gem has some great food and is also a nice place to come for some drinks. the menu does change with time, but one of the better little places to come both as a couple or with friends. lots of places to go nearby afterwards for drinks to

Maggie Joan's is not actually in Amoy St, but round the back and hard to find. Once the door opens it reveals a much larger than expected space, albeit reminiscent of being in someone's garage! We shared a section of starters, tapas style, all were delicious, and then we shared some mains, the slow cooked lamb shoulder, some fish (I cant find a copy of the menu online so can't remind myself exactly of the dishes - the restaurant has no website which is a minus). All were elegantly served, and the device was top notch too. A fun place e to go out with a bunch of fiends and rather unusual food for Singapore.

I dined at Maggie Joan's recently, and was very impressed. There is an obvious focus on meal presentation, as everything was very stylishly served on beautiful plateware. Presentation will only get you so far, but happily, the food followed through on its visual promise and was genuinely excellent. Flavours were well matched and balanced.The wine list is well considered, although we asked our waiter to pick something for us after we had explained what we liked. He picked well!The venue reminded me a little of Melbourne laneway restaurants, and it is hard to determine how good it is until you get inside. It is hidden away, but definitely worth searching for
4
It took a bit of doing but we found the restaurant after being dropped off in Amoy Street in front of the Employees Only bar. The entrance is in a little lane behind the row of restaurants on the road. When we arrived early for a reservation at 830pm, despite having many empty tables around, the waiter told us the table was not ready. After a few comments from hubby suggesting that we should be seated immediately, the waiter rushed off and in 2 mins, we were seated. Kudos for customer service and effort!The restaurant is pretty small with a great view of kitchen activities. Go if you like the casual enclosed dining experience.We ordered the raw hamachi and roasted cauliflower to start, and mains of lamb shoulder and the 36 hour pork collar as mains. All very good choices, with the pork dish winning hands down. One damper for the evening was the restaurant's wine. We felt they could have improve on the selection, and range.All in all, a great date night with hubs. If I were to go back for a second visit, it will be with our own bottle
4
What a great find. Visited with colleagues and had a fun evening. We tried the arranchini with tomato salsa and the hamachi crudo for entrees and they were delicious and well presented. For the mains, the octopus with Russian potato salad was amazing-definitely a crowd pleaser. On the other hand the pork collar and seabass were a little underwhelming as compared to the other dishes. Still tasted good but not memorable. I would definitely return but perhaps change up my selection of mains.Entrance is around the back via gemmil lane and bring a shawl- Super cold under the AC vents in the back area!

I had dinner at Maggie Joan's a few weeks ago and am already planning a return visit. I'd heard great things about the food at Maggie Joan's and am a big fan of Moosehead, their other restaurant, so I had high expectations and was not disappointed. Everything that I ordered was exceptional. The sourdough bread with beef fat butter and the cheese arancini that I started with were both amazing, the slightly sweet tomato chutney was the perfect accompaniment to the gooey arancini. For main I had the braised lamb shoulder with onion date jam and goat cheese, which once again was the perfect blend of sweet and savoury, with the lamb cooked to perfection and deliciously tender. I lucked into a dessert special, a white chocolate parfait that was absolutely gorgeous. As well as the excellent food the service was also lovely and attentive, and the atmosphere was great. I look forward to visiting again

Interesting menu, won't find it off the street as entrance for restaurant is via back street. Ambience has a cool vibe, and menu is interesting. we were happy with our choices.
5
Great staff. Well looked after. Stunning food. Really good value for money. Wine prices are also reasonable
5
I have been a few times this last month and each time the food has been amazing! Fantastic flavours and presentation. Love this restaurant, highly recommend it.
5
Fantastic food, nice service and reasonably priced - a true hidden gem of Chinatown - all by word of mouth - thoroughly recommended

Singapore is not only the "ideal" city that one's wants to build in SimCity. It still has a lot of small somehow hidden places that only locals know. Maggie Joan's dining and bar is one of them.Even though the official address is 110 Amoy street, the entrance is through Gemmill lane. Without my friend it would have been challenging to find it.As soon as you enter this rather small restaurant, the very cosy industrial decoration, the great music, the staff (very cool apron by the way) tell you that, should the food be as great as the atmosphere, you are going to spend an amazing time.And the food was simply sensational!We decided to let Bev, a very friendly staff of the restaurant, to choose for us. And it was the perfect decision! Inka roasted cauliflower, almond gazpacho, Iberico ham & mint; slow cooked lamb shoulder, onion date jam, aubergine & goat cheese; Jerusalem artichoke, manchego & Rosemary were among the dishes we had: to die for!Fantastic experience!! Well done

We had heard a lot of hype about Maggie Joans and decided to give it a try. Firstly, it says Mediterranean, but I wouldn't call Maggie Joan's a Mediterranean restaurant - its more modern European than anything with a few Mediterranean ingredients here and there. The restaurant is small & cozy, and a bit difficult to find. We were seated immediately at our table, after which service was attentive but not intruding.We first ordered some of their house wines (Pinot Noir, Merlot & Pinot Grigio) - all of which were good. Appetizers were nice as well - small portions but used good quality ingredients. We ordered the bread with beef fat butter, arancini with tomato chutney and hamachi crudos. For mains, the lamb and octopus were outstanding while the bass was alright, nothing special. For dessert, we had the day's special white chocolate parfait and the iced coffee chocolate dessert. Both were adequate. Overall, we paid $70 per person for the entire meal (inc. taxes & GST), which was pretty ok given the quality of food and the ambiance. I won't be rushing back there for a second round - but it could be a nice date night meal again n a couple of months.
5
What a great find.....word of mouth really. We ordered almost every starter and 2 mains to share between 4 of us, and everyone was raving about how wonderful each dish was. The main duck was incredible....the best duck any of us had ever had. Succulent and tender and not over seasoned as is usually the case with duck. We will definitely be returning to that secret little hole in the wall
4
It took me a while to find the place, the address says 110 Amoy Street but the entrance is at the back lane parallel to Amoy Street.The restaurant feels small and dim lit, the food and ambience though are very good. A couple of colleagues commented that it has a very Melbourne, Australia restaurant vibe (cool small lane restaurants) and I must say it did remind me of that.The house baked sourdough bread was great and so was the hamachi entree I had. Service was good overall
5
We had a lovely dinner here. The service was very efficient throughout, as well as helpful. The menu is varied, with lots of influences. We had the asparagus and hamichi sashimi to start, followed by egg and potato raviolo and slow cooked lamb for mains. All were delicious, with lovely clean flavours. For dessert we had dark chocolate custard, and strawberry with yoghurt. Both had an interesting twist to them, and were excellent. A lovely, cosy restaurant with great food. Recommend it highly
5
Maggie Joan's is a hidden gem in Singapore, the restaurant has a great atmosphere, the staff is friendly and the food is absolutely amazing. We ordered a number of dishes to try as much as possible and every dish that came out was better than the previous. If you are ever going to Singapore and looking for a great place to eat this place should be on your list
5
Tasting menu all around for us and food was awesome! Will definitely recommend to friends. See you soon.
5
Cute little place with great atmosphere. Great food selection, Big on taste. Very pleased with everything.
5
Totally hidden in a dedale of small streets, seeking this restaurant worth it!
The ambiance is very nice and cozy. The food is good even if the choice is not huge.
Really nice place beyond the must-be places.
5
We had the set menu and the food was superbly crafted and presented. Great, friendly service and the I really experience we would rate very highly.
4
The restaurants provides in general high quality food although some dishes are a bit hit or miss. The wine selection by the glass is limited, but the ambiance was great. And more importantly the sevice was great.
5
Great food, service and ambience. The cocktails are first class and the food excellent, make sure to try the squid!

"You won't find this place, so lets meet in Club Street". So we did and it was a real surprise. Excellent food & service, charming place with a great kitchen. Cool decoration. Very pleasant experience.

Hidden down Gemmil lane is Maggie Joans, one of the best dining experiences I have had in recent times. Singapore is such a melting pot of culture and cuisine that you expect a lot from those places you choose to eat at. What can I say? MJ's exceeded my high expectations. I am flying back to Singapore in a few weeks and the first thing I am going to do is take my wife straight to Maggie Joans. Give it a try, you wont regret it

I visited Maggie Joan's early this year, and loved my dinner experience there! True, they do have 2 seatings, so if you take the early one, you're going to have to leave for the 2nd seating. Well, we wanted an early dinner so it wasn't an issue to turn up at 6pm, in fact, we saw quite a lot of tables taken up soon after we sat down.If you're already a fan of Moosehead, tapas place nearby at Telok Ayer Street, you're probably going to love this, as this place is run by the father and son team responsible for Moosehead. There are some interesting appetizers to whet your appetite, like the Dukkah-dusted egg. I love how the golden yellow oozes and the spice-mix crust of the egg adds loads of middle eastern flavour to the dish.The dish that stole my heart was the Chicken Liver pate, though. It's pretty much perfection, pretty on the plate and pleasing on the tongue. The pate is rich, nicely offset with mint and cocoa soil, and lovely picked mushrooms to cut through the "fat" taste.The other dish that was great was the Grilled Iberico Pork - nicely charred, tender and flavourful and sweetened with prunes.Desserts are interesting too, i really enjoyed the chocolate dessert - a dark chocolate custard with a nice citrusy orange and fennel kick.2 hours was more than enough time for us to enjoy the whole experience, and we walked out there really happy. It's not that hard to find. Just enter Club street from Cross street end and turn left immediately onto Gemmil Lane and you'll see it ahead of you. Do make sure you reserve in advance

There's excitement in visiting this restaurant, with the nondescript back lane entrance, dim lighting (we have difficulty with our food photography) and the industrial chic decor. Business was brisk when we were there while the menu is simple, I wld prefer that the menu gives more description on the food item esp. The dessert which we have to check with the waiter what exactly it is who has to ask his colleague on the same. We thought that the food is nice but not exactly exceptional, no wow factor there.
5
Locating it was part of the charm! Great food at reasonable prices. There was a nice buzz to the place on a Friday night.
5
Every meal here is always awesome. The staff is always attentive. He even remembered where I sat and the wine I drank my last visit. The fact that they also change their menu means you never get bored of eating there.
4
love the place the design food good,but could be amazing.some of the flavor,clash in my humble view.so if they get the balance right,this could be one of the best in singapore
4
Place is difficult to find. Like a speak easy. Inside is crowded. But the service and the food is superb. One of the better places to eat in this part of town.
Eclectic food but fresh and tasty.
4
Very nice experience, the food was fabulous and the staff are very attentive. The sea bass was lovely, but the selection of sides was way too small. The restaurant has very a modern and cosy decor. Would recommend and will be back.Negatives: Tables are too close together, small menu, and the striplion is nice but not worth $88

We had dinner last night and ordered starters, mains and desserts as well. Firstly, their list of cocktails is rather limited, They did have Kir Royale on the list but it wasn't available.We had the egg dukkah and saffron mayo which was delicious. The fennel entree didn't live up to expectations. Didn't know what to make of it. For the mains, we had the lamb shoulder (the best thing about the meal) and the roasted seabass which was bland.All in all, an average meal in a place with a nice ambience.
4
amazing food and ambience. just the right portions which were plated and served up oh so pretty. we had the braised lamb shoulder, hamachi, grilled octopus, the charred cauliflower and all the desserts. my favorite dish of the night had to be a toss up between the hamachi or the blood orange dessert. so perfectly done. the menu descriptions don't do the food much justice. but they definitely tasted amazinggg. cocktails do need a little polishing as the g&t tasted average with a hint of rosemary and the negroni needed a little more oomph! but there's a wide variety of wines to make up for that. the ambience was perfect. with a catchy but soothing upbeat tune and a nicely dimmed lighting. will definitely be back to try more! thanks for the amazing meal!

We had dinner at Maghie Joan's with friends last night. At first glance at the menu the menu is quit unusual and I wasn't sure what to order. We shared 4 different starters and we had 3 different mains. Every dish was so flavoursome and so unique. It truly was a delight for the palate. We will be regulars. Thank you for a wonderful taste sensation. Service was also very good
5
An outstanding restaurant, one of the best in Singapore. High quality food, creative dishes and classy service. Cannot ask for more in an establishment. Be sure to have some pre-drinks and imported cheese next door in their accompanying wine bar Gemmills. Every time i come to Singapore i will book in a couple of dinners here. Well done
5
We decided to try this restaurant to celebrate the 29th of February. Located in an inner lane of Amoy street, it was rather hard to find but also made it unique and hard to forget. The restaurant is a hole in the wall sort of place with romantic ambience and friendly service. The food was absolutely fabulous and I've to say one of the most Creative menu I've seen in Singapore so far. The poached salmon and goat cheese dessert were stunning. The gin and tonic with rosemary and orange was a refreshing twist. Like all restaurants in Singapore, if we leave the value for money aspect -this restaurant is a must try!! It's very high on my list of recommendations for those looking for innovative Flavours.
4
Great service, simple menu for lunch and a nice ambience. I'd definitely go back again. It's tucked away in a little back lane which is a nice touch.
5
A really pleasant surprise when you open the very unassuming door. Nice atmosphere with open kitchen. Very tasty and interesting food. Also wines priced reasonably, as is often not the case in Singapore. We will be back again.

From appetizers to main course to desserts and finals service , this place delivers 5 star experience at all ends.It's indeed a hidden gem which must be explored while in Singapore - only thing I could pick upon would be the location !! It's really a pain to figure out ... But once you find the entrance door , it's complete bliss !! We tried the poached salmon and iberico Pork for mains - both were exceptional. Finally, goat cheese based dessert ensured that 29th feb 2016 will be remembered for one of the best meals in Singapore in my 9 years here.Try it to believe !!!

We were excited to be dining in the club street vicinity to check out a newer place. Bottom line while the food was not bad it was not value for money - price and size of portions. You can do better in this town at approx $ 100 / head. Maybe it didn't help that the wine was lacking compared to similar priced ones at other fine places we ate this week. We ordered the Egg Dukka which my Dad and I enjoyed but you have to have a taste for a runny egg. The heirloom tomato and cheese appetizer was so so. The pork was pretty good but the tuna was mediocre. The dessert menu had changed so could not try the orange cake. The chocolate custard was really soggy though the goat cheese helped redeem the desserts.

What a lovely, quirky place, hidden away in a back alley, zany, comfortable, friendly. I am going to ask you to go try it. Not because I can guarantee that your meal will be great, but because there is a possibility it will be. I only had lunch there, so I would not want to judge on that alone. Two great starters, deftly prepared and then one truly great mains, fettuccini, pesto minestrone, ham hock - really, really tasty and well balanced. But also a harissa chicken breast with couscous - dry, thin, unrelentingly boring. Saying that, I can excuse the chicken, because I ate half the pasta.

Tucked away in a little alley at the side of Luke's Chop House on Gemmill Lane - bit of a speakeasy type entrance, into a cosy but small interior - the tables really are close together, so not a place for sharing your intimate secrets unless you're happy to let the people on the next table in on the story.My food was fabulous - scallop tartare to start and a perfectly cooked and very flavoursome tuna Nicoise for main course. High praise round the table for the roast potato starter and the pork main course. Wines were excellent too, but they insisted on setting the white aside to keep it cool, and then committed the cardinal sin of not topping people up quickly enough. The bare brickwork and the crowded room also make it very noisy, and we had to ask for the a.c to be turned up as it got very hot.Plus one for the Aesop products in the bathroom - nice stylish touch.A little gem - we'll definitely be back, and if the few little flaws can be ironed out, this is well on the way to a five star rating

Location4/5 - quietly tucked away from the usual drunked ra ra of club street yet not too hard to get to. It's unassuming entrance sets u and ur guest up for a surprise once you enter. Ambience 4/5 - romantically and mysteriously dark. Let's u dine in privacy despite tables being close to each other. Music at the right level, restaurant acoustics let's you talk comfortably. Food 3/5 - interesting menu and ingredients but it didn't carry through to the actual food. Also portions a bit small for the price. Roasted cauliflower with pomegranate and the carrot side dish looked like it would have had that good roast/charred taste but it just tastes boiled.Iberico pork was very salty, but the taste wasn't strong - just tasted like a salty char Siew that lacked substance. Service 4/5 Generally good, food came quickly, friendly and efficient service staff.

A nondescript door along an empty back alley is the entrance to Maggie Joan’s. Pull open the door and you’ll see a cozy and dimly lit restaurant, and a friendly waitress ready to show you to your seats. Speaking of seats – make sure you have reservations as the popular, months-old restaurant gets packed. The Roast Jerusalem artichoke, & manchego, which tasted like potato, came with manchego cream and cheese and mixed seeds and nuts. Would have preferred more texture in this dish. The signature Egg, dukkah & saffron mayo has an egg which is poached, then fried, and coated in dukkah. It is served with saffron mayo shaped like an egg yolk on the side. It was a lovely introduction to the Egyptian spice blend, which is still not widely found in Singapore. The Swordfish, Tabbouleh was cooked with the insides still pink and moist, and was served with a non-traditional tabbouleh. The bursts of sweetness from the dried fruit, creaminess of the sauce and crunchy nuts were a lovely contrast. This perked up the meal after the rather average appetisers. The Roast bass, pesto & marinated tomatoes came drenched in a flavourful pesto soup and the marinated tomatoes were tart and juicy. The Grilled Iberico pork jowl, prunes, & cauliflower, served with marinated prunes, pickled cauliflower, fried curry leaves and creamy cauliflower puree (yum!), was melt-in-the-mouth tender. We also ordered the Rangers Valley strip loin & salsa verde, which was cooked to the right doneness, though it looked smaller than a sharing portion, and a side of Fried potato, ricotta, bottarga. The fish roe provided a light, salty crunch. Delicious! The much-raved-about Orange cake, yoghurt & pistachio, a dense slice of loaf cake completely soaked in orange syrup, was just alright when compared with the other two desserts we ordered. The coconut and mango tart – the special of the day – featured perfectly complimentary fruit and was of just the right sweetness. Everyone was raving about it, so simple yet delicious. The Goat’s cheese, raspberry, muscatel & bee pollen was pleasantly pungent and earthy; perfect with the sour raspberries. I couldn’t make out the other accompaniments with the explosion of flavours in my mouth. It was the perfect ending to the meal with a tiny glass of Limoncello

This is my second meal and food was good but service was off putting. I was told when making a reservation that they needed the table back by 8 pm but didn't realize they would police it to the letter. Being a solo diner, I managed to finish all my courses before the bill was plonked unceremoniously on my table without asking if I wished to order anything else. I took it in my stride but the couple next to me were flabbergasted & were complaining quite loudly. A shame since I ate a delicious starter of burrata with plums & heirloom tomatoes. I also ordered a beautiful piece of strip loin with roasted carrot & cauliflower side dishes. The meat was cooked as ordered but was gristly and grilled fat doesn't have a good mouth feel. I have to say the efforts of my server were let down by the management attitude. They are running a business but it feels as if the diner comes second

New Mediterranean-inspired concept discreetly tucked away in the backstreets of hip and buzzy Amoy-Telok Ayer area, the entrance could be a little difficult to find (entry through Gemill Lane). We came for lunch - the fare was above average but choices rather limited. The servers seem rather unfamiliar with the menu and one of the servers was rather curt in her answers. Cld shape up to be a great place if they sort out the kinks
