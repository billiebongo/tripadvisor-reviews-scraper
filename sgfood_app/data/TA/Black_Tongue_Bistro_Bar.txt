Came back here today with the intention of having lunch. Unfortunately it seems to have closed down completely, with a sign on the door advising as much. A pity as the food wasn't bad here.

Booked the restaurant for dinner as I was attracted by salted egg menu... The ambience is great as it is not too noisy. Price is affordable. Service is great too. The burger is good too but not overly fantastic..

Took my Mum and brother here on Mother's day for lunch. There was a wide selection of food to choose from, all of which came out freshly prepared and beautifully presented. The service was excellent as was the food. I'll be back!

I had lunch there and it was the best place to chill out. The portion of the fish and chip was big and it was worth spending on such good food. Would come back for more. The waiters and waiteress was tip top in service.

Great western food in a standard upmarket bistro setting. Good service and perfect if you want a change from Asian style eating houses. The prices were very reasonable.
We had a steak and the Korean ribs. Definitely enjoyed the food and the service was fast.

Just found this place by chance recently and then came here for lunch today to try the set lunch at only $12 or so for 3 courses. Food was really quite decent considering the price point involved. Definitely worth a visit.

It was an all girls night out and we decided on this bistro for its convenient location. We went with the recommendation of the staff and had mushroom & sweet corn chowder soup, mushroom & lotus root salad, honey baked wings, clam pasta, holy cow burger and duck confit. We enjoyed all the dishes and vowed to come back to try the other dishe

We went and visited Black Tongue Bistro for a meal after visited before for drinks previously and been tempted by all the food coming out of the kitchen!We went for a selection of food including the truffle fries, satay, beef cheek and duck, and absolutely nothing was left on the plates at the end!Good range of beers, and made a nice change to have something other than the usual Tiger/Heineken selection found in Singapor
