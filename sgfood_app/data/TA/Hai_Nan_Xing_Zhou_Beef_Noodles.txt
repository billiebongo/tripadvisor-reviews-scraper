My first time here. Ordered kwayteow beef soup and requested that beef not to be overcooked. Boss immediately assured that they will be "half cooked". Turned out excellent and the broth was thick with tinge of sourness.

The quality of the food is very good, especially the soup which accompanies the dry version of the beef noodles. Please ask for the chinchalok to go with the chilli as it is kept separately from the rest of the utensils. The quantity of the small portion is just nice for breakfast

Something about this beef noodle. Its such a comfort food when you feel like to warm up your stomach. The have really good soup base and good chilli (but not spicy for me as I have high tolerance for chilli). A must visit hawker food in SG.

The is the best beef noodle in Singapore. Every fortnightly, our family will drive all the way from the other side of the island just a bowl of the best! Even now my youngest son love it, by the way he is only 18months old. The stall owners are friendly and generous on the portion. Their beef tendon are my favorite

This is my ‘go-to’ place for traditional Hainanese Beef Noodles. They were previous from the Cuppage Hawker Centre, and shifted here many many years ago. I rediscovered them years ago and after eating at this stall, I have returned many time over.You have a choice of noodles (Chor Bee Hoon - Thick Vermicelli/ Bee Hoon - Thin Vermicelli/ Yellow Noodles/ Kway Teow – Flat white noodles). My favourite is the Chor Bee Hoon - Thick Vermicelli.You have an option of dry noodles which comes with a thick starchy brown sauce or noodles with soup. For your order, there are a variety of options: - Beef Ball: $4- Sliced Beef with Beef Ball: $4- Sliced Beef, Beef Ball with Stomach – Tripe: $5- Sliced Beef, Beef Ball, Stomach – Tripe with Tendon: $6- Tendons: $7Most times, I will order the sliced beef and Beef Ball option at $4. If I am hungry, I will go for $5. My lunch partner couldn’t resist the tendons and ordered a tendons with soup, for sharing. I ordered the dry version - sliced beef and Beef Ball option. The thick starchy brown sauce was full of umami, with soy and beef flavour.The beef was well cooked and the beef balls were nice and had a good bite. The tendons were also nice and soft. There is always a queue here and you take about 20 minutes to get to your turn. But the wait is well worth it.Highly-Recommended
