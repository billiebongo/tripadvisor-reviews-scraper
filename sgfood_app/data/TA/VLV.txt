All food was dry and tasteless and not hot enough. Dont require a management response as they should have sorted it out on the night.
Beware.!!!!

A good selection of chinese food. Price is a little steep but worthwhile. Some interesting dishes. I enjoyed dim sum and meat selection. Fried rice was good. Suggest to go as a group to be able to try out different dishes. Drinks could be better.

Ambience is good but not for patrons with a tight budget. Service is good and still have room for improvements. Situated in Clark Quay where food establishments aplenty. Their food taste good with a tinge of class. Only tried their set menu due to CNY. Will return to try their ala carte dishes.

Went to VLV for my mum’s birthday recently. Made a reservation for the beggar chicken and chairman’s crab which were both excellent! Service was great, friendly. Housed in a beautiful house, it transforms into a lounge at night. Definitely one of the value for money restaurants along Clarke quay!

Went for dim sum buffet but find it a mediocre. Felt that lunch and dinner kitchen have bi-standard as i had a good impression of its dinner fare previously. Was under staff and no attention to dinners. Had a hot ala cart dish for our vegetarian couple but turns out with cold and under cook filling. Very disapponting standard and experience given the reputation behind its kitchen.

We came here to chill out on Friday and found we were very happy with VLV. We ordered 6-7 dishes and they were tasty with good portion. The atmosphere and live music were really great. Service was a bit slow but we satisfied with the restaurant in overall though price was quite high

dropped by for a colleague's hens night that was celebrated there. the place looks rather grand from the outside, with some nice cosy tables and chairs just outside the indoor area that is typically reserved for private functions. our larger group was ushered to some more restaurant looking tables and chairs that were lined up by the river. service-wise pretty okay. did not stay long to try the food, but the drinks were rather pricey, a glass of your typical local brew would probably set you back $20

nice to sit on the terrace, lively but comfortable.I enjoyed the food, even if prices were rather high.The waiters didn't pay a lot of attention

Located at the quieter end of the famed Clark quay area. We occupied a table in open air section. Vibes were right for a Friday late night. There were popular numbers being played but not too loud. We enjoyed few casual drinks. Unfortunately, the kitchen was closed so we had to move to other pace for dinne

My husband and I were in Clarke Quay looking for somewhere to have drinks & dinner. VLV looked to be a great spot and even had a band starting. We sat on the river side (rather than the bar side, which is smoking) but this meant we couldn't get the happy hour drinks deal. The service was great and the Australian waitress who served us towards the end recommended a great dessert - was definitely worth it. The food was great however my main, a stir fried beef was just 'ok' compared to the other dishes we had. Over all, would definitely recommend
5
We had excellent Chinese foods there with very good service. The restaurant has live band and very exotic layout which is perfect for group night out.
4
Good food with innovative presentations and Creative design for food! A little din lighting for a Chinese restaurant ! Recommended to entertain your friends and business customers !

We walked over from Riverside Point after dinner. The group looked for a watering hole and finally settled on VLV. This place has been around for a long time.
Most of us had 2 rounds of wheat beers, and scotch on rocks. Nice live music.
3
We ate late here (10pm). Someone should tell restaurateurs that an unbreakable rule is: if you are open for business and people are eating DO NOT start to clean-up and rearrange the furniture for the following day. The waitress forgot our drinks and even when this was pointed out it took too long to serve them. The sweet and sour pork was delicious but the sesame chicken was average, while the fried rice with egg and prawns was fine. Positioned right on the river, VLV is an ideal location for a meal.

My husband and I were wandering around Clarke Quay looking for somewhere nice to have a relaxing drink and we came upon a large open air courtyard at the rear of the VLV Restaurant. It looks very inviting at night, lots of tables, mood lighting, outdoor bar and a small stage on one side for live music with a huge video screen behind it. Whilst not cheap, $42 for a Suntory beer & a cocktail, it was a very relaxing and pleasant spot to enjoy a drink and listen to good live music

I've been wanting to try VLV and decided to patronize them for my Mother-in-law's 70th birthday. It was a great decision. The menu designed by the restaurant was lovely and service is lovely. Despite the romantic vibes, they are well trained to accommodate 2 pre schoolers. There's enough drama in the food presentation but yet one can tell the chef has strong fundamentals.We went back a second time recently and continued to be surprised positively.
4
The ambiance is the PLUS point at VLV, the big screen and exotic building Chinese emperor like made it really unique. It is located at the central of Clarke Quay. Service and food were really nothing to talk about. Price is not cheap however, great place to hang out

To fully appreciate the creativity of chef Martin, one should go in a large group and order à la carte. Our couple did the brunch semi-buffet instead. Very good value, with some unusual dishes, ranging from OK to excellent, except for the Kurobota chiarsew noodle which is too salty. Friendly and efficient serving staff. The non-serving staff could be overzealous and blurred: (1) In spite of having left a message not to call because I was engaged, an associate called me twice and sent several SMS's asking if I wanted to pre-order any special dish. (2) Although we went for the brunch, the cashier mistakenly charged us by the dish - which would have been more than twice the price! Décor is luxurious, but a bit 'night-clubby-ish', not classy - Versace or LV but not Hermès

Good place for entertaining business people. Bar at the bottom and restaurant on top. Sometimes we get bored of peking chicken so the speciality here is the beggar chicken which has to be pre-ordered. It's fun because everyone has to try and break the clay that surround the chicken. Food was okay - didnt like the crab as the egg white was a bit starchy. Liked the Kai Lan

We had an enjoyable dinner at VLV. Love the luxe interiors & ambiance. The taste and presentation of the food were impressive.The Shoyu deep-fried Marble Goby fish was excellent.We enjoy the Kagoshima Kurobuta Char Siew, beggar chicken & sizzling romaine lettuce too.Our complimentary birthday dessert is beautiful presented & very yummy. (kind of sesame ball stuff with salted egg)After dinner can have a drink at the lounge area.This place is great for special occasion
4
Nice venue with live music at a quieter spot of Clarque key. The outdoor area is perfect when the weather is nice. Both bands were really good. The Singapore slings were great!!
4
Great place for a private lunch with associates or family. Chef Martin does an excellent job with his innovative creations and exquisite variation of tastes. The lunch set menu is good value. Service is however lacking unfortunately and stepping this up will make things complete for repeat visits and a restaurant destination of choic

Was there for business meeting, the food was average, not very outstanding. The service was satisfactory, the food came at an all right pace, but the staff were not friendly nor cheerful. Felt that the price was on the high side. Would not go if it was not paid by the company

Was there to dine with in-laws today. Very disappointed with the lack of service. Actually I was there with my hubby two months ago & we liked the food & received very warm service. So we recommended VLV to my in-laws. We all decided to dine at VLV to celebrate belated Mother's Day today, and were shocked at how the service level dropped. E.g we were not informed that the additional beancurd skins for the fish soup were chargeable, the servers were not prompt in refilling our glasses & the we waited more than half an hour for the desserts which never came. We asked two servers about the desserts; they said they will check but never came back to us. So in the end we decided to cancel the dessert order & they seemed happy to do so! As we were leaving, my mum in law remembered that her umbrella was placed aside when she came into the restaurant. So we mentioned to the lady at the door that we'd left an umbrella with the concierge & we wanted to retrieve it. She told us "We have no concierge; you must go to the back to find your own umbrella. There are so many umbrellas on the floor, we don't know which one is yours!" And she walked away. It's such a pity as although the food was good, we'll have to think twice before going back to this place.

Stopped in for a quick drink on the patio facing the "river". Nice enough list of options on the menu, a few that are somewhat out of the ordinary. Inside seemed like it would be worth a look in, but was content to stay on the patio. Fairly good staff, perhaps a little slow, with typical Clark Quay prices for drinks (i.e. high)
4
Had dinner there with relatives. The service was good. They allowed us to bring our bottle of wine provided we bought one from them as well. That was fair. Service was professional, even had the Head chef come out and say hello. They had their version of Peking duck, which was good. The duck meat served in a cornetto was quite a novel idea. Crackling pork belly was so good. Sizzling romaine lettuce was also good.The Kagoshima Kurobuta Char Siew was excellent. Expensive yes. There are better in town, but the ambience, service makes it a special occasion type of place

Went for late night drinks on a weeknight. Good collection of alcohol– one of the few places that actually weren't sold out on Japanese whiskey– but a bit pricey (even compared to the already expensive Singapore average price).Ambience outside was a good mix of casual and hip– lighting, seating, architecture, music (they had a duo perform live that night). Inside, it was loud and the decors were a bit flashy, even pretentious.For its drinks selection, design, and the nice breeze coming from the nearby river, overall– as long as you stay outside, and the outdoor area is large, anyway– would recommend as a good place to catch after-work drinks

Had dinner with my family, 5 adults and 2 kids, at VLV on a Saturday evening. We were early (around 6+pm) and the restaurant was quite empty, so the waitresses didn't look busy yet. But somehow, I don't feel the welcoming and hospitality from the waitresses. The waitress just put the menu on our table and leave us. Usually at other Chinese restaurants, once we sit down, the waitress will hand us the menu and suggest us to order tea or some drink first while we slowly browse through the menu. And they also didn't suggest or offer any recommendation to us about their signature dishes. Neither did they bother to ask us whether it is our first time visiting their restaurant. Food wise, the taste and presentation of food were good. But it is the kind that I will only go again if someone else is footing the bill. Because, there are other Chinese restaurants which serves equally nice and authentic Peking ducks.

This place is really awful.Nobody there to greet you and a filthy stained carpet leafs you upstairs to the actual restaurant.Later on you get blasted by terrible "music" from the disco below.The waitress did not understand English at all and eventually a more senior person informed us that most of what we had ordered was not available.What we got eventually were prawns(tasteless and undercooked) with noodles that tasted of dishwasher liquid.The duck with a few token slices of truffle was ok but nothing at all special and nearly stone-cold.The staff seemed to be setting up for brunch the next day instead of paying any attention to the customers.Incredibly the chef won an award recently.I can only think the judges did not actually visit this filthy grubby hopeless place

Love both the interior and exterior of VLV!! Was brought to the second floor where the restaurant is and my friends and I were wowed by the spacious and beautifully decorated area. A very luxurious vibe..We were also impressed by the food. All cooked to perfection.. Our favs were the beggar chicken and soya prawns! Must try!!! We also got the orh nee for dessert and it was actually served chilled instead of hot. Very creative!! It was delicious as well.The staff were also kind and attentive with fast service.We later went downstairs where their Courtyard is located for some Friday night drinks -- some wine, great live music and a pretty river view. Will definitely be back again

No atmosphere, pretentious, inattentive, average food and overpriced... do I need to add more?! Don't bother, there are so many other lovely places to visit instead!!!!

58++ / pax. Came on sat lunch, crowd was moderate. Had quite a decent spread of food. They call it dim sum buffet but I guess it's more like an oriental cuisine buffet. Either way, the food is good and definitely worth the 58++

Enjoy creative modern Chinese cuisine in a conserved traditional Chinese house where the upper level has ample dining tables and private rooms for family gatherings and business meals, while the lower level becomes a haven for the partying crowd at night. One can take in the beautiful architectural details of the heritage building as you dine in the natural lighting through the skylight by night or enjoy a drink in the former courtyard while gazing up at the stars by night. Other than the award-winning chef's signature dishes, there is a good selection of dim sum as well as seafood. Accompanied with a good wine list, this is a good choice for entertaining foreign guests in the Clarke Quay area by the Singapore River.The only disappointment was the dessert which was not sweet at all, denying diners of the perfect finale to the meal

Arguably the best Crispy noodles in Singapore! The noodles is still crispy although it's soaked in the delicious Brian computed gravy. Some parts were soaked with the flavourful gravy and it's a good combination of both gravy and the crispy bits. Ambience is fantastic too! Place is cosy with a LUXE feel. Service is good too! Definitely worth the money!

Went to celebrate a birthday lunch. Beautiful paintings adorn the walls of the restaurant with light from skylight roof providing classy lighting. Wine cellar near an entrance into dining area on second floor was not lighted up (probably in evenings) would have added luxury to teh room. We sat in the central area with sofa sufficient for one couple (may be too small for larger people), as sofa was shared on four sides. Was served attentively by Wendy, who provided great service throughout the meal.Dim sum was good, especially lobster dumpling and "har kou" with fresh ingredients, and also the chili crab pows. The serving of chilli accompaniment was not salty but added unami to some of the dishes.Crackling pork was crispy and not salty nor too fatty. The shark cartilage soups were very excellent having been boiled for several hours. The lobster wanton had lobster meat and the soup spicy but very satisfying.The specialty beggar chicken pleasantly surprised with the modern presentation/serving with flames, and diners participation in breaking open the clay wrapping. Sizzling romaine lettuce was intriguing, being served in a claypot, and yet remaining crispy with a trace of traditional flavour of salted fish. The yuzu noodle served in individual portions with scallops or lobster were outstanding, well presented in round noodle rolls, and left lingering feel of citrus, and of the freshness of sea. Rounded our luncheon with many desserts. "Or nee" topped with coconut ice cream was smooth and flavourful without feeling heavy or oily. The almond cream was outstandingly smooth. What a delicious meal! Looking to visit this restaurant again soon

It is a place more for evening with lighting in effect. However, dim sum was good quality and creative dishes are everywhere in menu. Food was good but slightly slow as there were only few occupied tables during Monday lunch. Service was slow and not alert.All in all, it is hit and miss place, it will not be in my list to return anytime soon

We had an enjoyable dinner with refined Chinese cuisine. Martin and his team did a fab job in reliving my memories of Lei Garden in their hey and high standards days. The Chef certainly up the game and present a whole array of dishes at its best. Must have are the Char Siew, pork crackling belly, Kim Chi Seafood Rice. To end of the evening should be the sweet Yam paste. He certainly add to a twist to the original Teochew dessert. We are so impressed by Vincent the Ops Manager who made the night more memorable with his introduction of exquisite wines and Armagnac. Customer service is a bonus in Singapore due to labour crunch in the F&B industry. But we were lucky with attentive service rendered by Wendy and another young lady

We booked a table and on the phone and confirmed the price of $58 without drinks. On arrival the waitress said the price was $78. We showed her the website on our smartphones: the reply was "oh it hasn't been updated". They refused to honour the price quoted on the website. This is appalling misrepresentation and mis-selling. Awful customer service: they obviously didn't care if our party of 7 people ate there or not. There was no apology or interest in giving any customer satisfaction. They kept making excuses such as 'its Chinese New Year' (2 weeks ago), and 'you got the wrong price'. Unbelievable.We left without eating: it wasn't about the difference of SGD20, it was the lying and rudeness of the staff which put us off.Won't be going there again

This new restaurant advertised special weekend brunch rates of $58 for food with no drinks and $78 with drinks. When we arrived the waitress announced the price was $78. They made up all kinds of excuses such as 'it's still Chinese New Year' which it wasn't because that was all wrapped up yesterday. Then they said that the 'website had not been updated'. But when we made the reservation they confirmed the $58 charge. They were rude and intransigent. The manager who came along also tried to justify their higher price. Then they sneaked off and 'updated' their website - to a template!! With no information about prices at all!! Absolutely no customer service skills or even attempt at being nice to customers. Will be sure never to go there again.

Went there for a business dinner to celebrate CNY - quality of the food proposed was really good and the service at the restaurant very professional.We had a few drinks outside before dinner and the place is quite enjoyable, but service was a disaster - we had to repeat our orders several times, had to wait for a while for simple beers,,... while all waiters were gathered just a few meters away.Then inside it's a kind of bar, with some dancing area... resulting a bit weird - especially when it is empty on a Thursday night.PS: bring a sweater or your jacket - it is freezing insid
