Service and the environment are good. Definitely will come back again for the short ribs. Good job guys!

We sat at the bar and got to watch the bartender makes some beautiful drinks!! Not cheap but the decor is elegant and the bar stools are comfortable leather. So glad we stopped in. Complimentary chips and olives too.

My wife and I visited Anti: Dote on a January Sunday for a afternoon high tea. The restaurant is located on the ground floor lobby of a hotel. We could see the bustling movement of guests checking in and leaving the hotel.We had a very comfortable seat. The food was served in a very interesting jewellery box with three drawers. The items came in very small bite size which I thought was just right for a afternoon tea.Staff were friendly and attentive. Overall it was a nice ambience. We had an enjoyable afternoon at the Anti: Dote

Yesterday my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed High Tea at Anti:dote in the Fairmont Hotel in Singapore. Two sitting times are available. We chose 3-5pm. The afternoon tea was beautifully presented. A choice of two delicious egg appetisers preceded a small mirror topped chest of padded drawers filled with enticing savoury and sweet petit fours. Pots of hot herbal tea were continually topped up. Service was very attentive and the subdued, classy lounge provided a restful ambience. While the amount of food provided was not as much as High Tea served at the olde world Fullerton Hotel In Singapore it was quite adequate and we felt full at the end. I would recommend this experience to anyone who enjoys afternoon teas

This is a wonderful lounge located in the Fairmont Singapore. It is a small but very pleasant lounge with excellent service and the best Singapore Sling I have every had (the bartender is from Raffles, which was closed during our visit). The prices are high, but the service is great
5
Although dinner menu announces tapas and lunch menu is more about burger and hot dogs (had an amazing lobster hot dog there), food is truly excellent and worth any fine dinning restaurant. The tapas are succulent and the quantity is very ok for the price. I came here 4 times already since August and enjoyed everything I ordered. I am not a seafood person however I dared to eat oysters, caviar, soft shell crab and ended up enjoying it ! The short rib we had a few days ago were excellent !So far, this is the best fine dinning restaurant I have been to in Singapore and my standards are quite high as I am French. I will definitely come back to try the new menu; Congrats to the chef for his creativity

Had afternoon tea at the Anti:Dote lounge in Fairmont Singapore at the end of December when they have a special one for the festive season.It was one of the top priorities in our to-do list during our Singapore trip.When we got there before 3pm as the afternoon tea starting time, it was fully booked already. Though we nearly gave up, their staff kindly put us on the waiting list and we finally got it after a short waiting time. While we were waiting, one of the staff, Maria who is absolutely wonderful, hospitably talked to us. I was there with a young child and so it was a great help that Maria kindly spoke to us affectionately.They set a price for Children’s tea set, too. Therefore we could order for one adult and one child instead of for two adults. The portions were just right and the price was appropriate.Also during the entire course, Maria treated us with civility. It made our trip very special as well.I’m such an afternoon tea lover and have been to some other famous tea places in different countries (London, Tokyo, Sydney, Vancouver, Shnghai and Hong Kong). But I could rate this at Fairmont as the best regarding the taste of both food and tea, beautiful looking, atmosphere and the excellent staff them all. Everything was perfect!We really appreciated their civility and hospitality, and highly recommend this afternoon tea
5
Located off the lobby of The Fairmont Hotel, I would recommend Anti:dote on a number of levels, most notable amongst which are the excellently crafted signature cocktails and the extremely personable service. Everyone is amazingly friendly and attentive and they make you feel very very welcome. I must mention Maria as she was wonderful; she goes out of her way to look after guests and is always smiling. Singapore has no shortage of hotel bars but this one stands out for me; it's the sort of place you can stop by for an early-evening aperitif as easily as lingering over afternoon tea or ending the night with friends. Something for everyone. Well worth a look

I visited Antidote on Christmas day and have had a high tea there. They serve numerous of pastry and mini cake. I chose the organic egg as my starter, and I like the taste!But too bad, since I do not really have a sweet tooth, I find the pastry and mini cake are more to sweet taste, thus, in the end I even cannot swallow few piece of the mini cake, it's just too sweet for me

My review is about fairmont in general, but the Antidote Bar in particular. Just one word: abysmal.to begin with, it has no view at all (unless you consider a street corner scenic). the food is overpriced, and the whole place simply exudes a very pretentious vibe. Its almost like someone tried to design a hotel concept bar that is supposed to look like a prison cafeteria, but ended up putting an tiresome decor behind bars (well, there are indeed some other bars right in front of the stree corner--where you are better off anyway--even if it was the last meal you will ever on death row).but more crucially, the service is truly deplorable--i went to the toilet, and came back to a waitress (Chloe) who promptly cleared my glasses... and who stood there scowling at me right upon realizing her faux pas. Avoid at all costs. As for the rest of the hotel, its boring. better off in a real prison as a matter of fact
5
Anti:Dote is a fantastic place to taste a great cocktails! Singapore Sling from Demi was amazing! Superb service from the lovely and friendly bartenders. I would love to have the chance to go back again. This place can't be missed!
5
Since Raffles Hotel has closed. We change to Anti dote bar. And the Singapore Siling from Andy is also very nice.
4
Interesting moments of creative pairing: this cocktail bar pushes the limits of flavors from such staples like Macallan 12y whiskeys. I enjoyed every sip of the carefully curated concoctions, and the artfully prepped snacks and desserts.
5
Cosy with warm lighting to relax and good opportunity to catch up with colleagues. The service standard is high and the food presentation is beautiful with interesting flavours. Definitely go back there again
3
Good place to have drink, nice drink list, good hospitality eventhough some of the waitresses were apparently lack in English, dessert was also interesting! 😃 different dessert everyday. Please keep in mind that they don’t open till midnite.
5
We came here and wow... Once in a life is something you have to try.
I couldn't eat everything. I'm more for salty, but here you have more sweet.
But the scones are really good
4
Singapore Slings at Raffles were out because it’s closed for renovations but the cocktail bar in the Fairmont Hotel, just over the road, was second choice but not second class. We had a Corpse Reviver for just $12 during Happy hour and probably saved ourselves $100SD. A lovely little bar, which seemed popular with locals on a Friday night. Staff were very friendly and helpful.
4
Situated on the ground floor of the Fairmont Hotel, Anti-dote is a very pleasant bar with a mix of comfortable seating and high-top tables that provide power points (plug and USB). Anti-dote offers a good selection of cocktails and wines, and the service was very good.
4
We ducked into the Fairmont since it started drizzling during our late night walk around the area. Anti: Dote was not crowded and lots of seats at the bar. We had a great female bartender. We ordered a Singapore Sling and a French Martini. The bar's decor is very hip/contemporary. I'd go back to this place if given a chance to return to Singapore
2
Don't know whether I was unlucky, but I met up with a tasting session for the media apparently, so the service was subpar. Still, not much of an excuse. The food and tea was good, but it doesn't matter if your service turns people off, especially if it costs so much in the first place. Good food, very pricey and poor service. I guess check there's a tasting session before you make a reservation
1
Utterly bad service... Unbelievable... Second time here and service never changed.... All rushing and impatient and cut you off ....
5
The service, ambience, presentation and taste were perfection. I would recommend anyone who would like to be pampered to check it out. The staff were the best.
5
We loved this bar. It was so relaxing after busy morning shopping. The service was fantastic and the meals were excellent and very reasonably priced considering the lovely decor.
5
Stopped by Anti:dote to try their afternoon tea. It was beautifully presented exactly like their counterpart in Jakarta (Fairmont Jakarta) and tasted equally awesome!
1
Antidote is regularly featured on local food blogs so we decided to drop by to have a cup of tea on a rainy afternoon. The experience was utterly disappointing we didn't even stay for our cup of tea. Staff had told us that no cocktails were available until 5pm and yet we saw the bartender mixing drinks at the bar for foreign guests. The menu consisted solely of the afternoon tea set and there were no ala carte options available. When we asked for the drinks menu, we were met with a scowl from staff. Please work on your service for a 5-star hotel. I've always enjoyed great service at the rest of the Fairmont restaurants and the hotel itself, so this experience has really left a bitter taste. While we appreciate that we had visited over the F1 weekend and there were more tourists than usual, please try to maintain some basic civility to local guests as well.

The service staff are busy and not attentive. Took quite awhile to get the waitress's attention. The afternoon tea set comes with drawers. The scones were a little too big to fit in the drawer, causing the scones to get in contact with the drawer. Am not sure how clean the underside of the drawer is. Table settings were not set ready for us. Cutleries and plates were placed at the side of the table. Me and my partner set it infront of us ourselves. The waiter only helped to set it just before the drawer is served. Upon reservation of the afternoon tea, I mentioned in my email that it was for a birthday celebration. Disappointed that Antidote did not arrange anything. As compared to other tea sessions that I have been to, Antidote needs to brush up.

The afternoon tea comes in a set of drawers; 4 tiers - plain and chocolate scones, cookies we could take away, savoury finger sandwiches and a tray of sweet desserts. The scones were beautifully crumbly and accompanied by lemon curd, clotted cream and jam. The chocolate scone, however, was too salty.The cookies came individually wrapped. They were not noteworthy.The finger sandwiches were adequate - an expected assortment of smoked salmon, tuna, duck rilette and potato pie on various types of bread. Again, it was alright but not particularly impressive. The sweets were pretty and quite rich. Although it didn't look like much, it left us comfortably full albeit slightly underwhelmed.If you like sitting with your friends for an uninterrupted and peaceful conversation, this is the place to go. The staff is polite, though they leave you to your own devices most of the time. If you're the sort who enjoys variety and the flexibility to alternate between savoury, sweet and back, then you may be better off at a high tea buffet instead
5
Popped in here twice during a recent visit to Singapore Part of the Fairmont Hotel, this bar is an excellent venue for cocktails prior to going on to dine elsewhere in the CityThe staff are charming and attentive Not a cheap place to drink but well worth itI can recommend the Gin-based Tonic #
3
1st visit to Anti Dote for Hi Tea with friends. Great variety of cakes and teas. I'm not into hi tea and stuff like that. I'd prefer dimsum/yum cha anyday.Please see pictures to justify it and if you like to go for cakes, chocolate and teas.INFO: No gluten free cakes available but you can still order ala carte meals.
2
No people attend to us when we reached the restaurant.Waitress service is poor with no smiley face and unable understand the accent of Philippine English.Food is OK, nothing special. Inconvenience to take out the food from the drawer. Although it's claimed that they using the TWG tea, but it taste as normal.Won't be back
5
As a person who is particular about dining ambience, this place is great. I enjoyed by lunch and will certainly consider coming back.
5
What a lovely way to spend the afternoon! My friends and I treated ourselves to a beautiful afternoon today - lovely food, tea....and bubbles.
4
Lovely ambience, a great place for drinks and afternoon tea looked great but couldn't manage it. Found the staff friendly and fun. Don't forget to plan for the tax and service charge when thinking about your bill
3
Attached to the Fairmont Hotel, relatively small bar which also serves some snacks and tapas. As others have noted it is expensive but I have to say the chicken snack looked great and tasted really good.
Teas and coffees very expensive
4
Was really very full after the hightea.. a lot of variety from savoury to sweet.. love the drawer concept however the drawer seems abit overuse.. love the selection for hightea here in antidote !Easily top10 hightea places in Singapore.. Service was on point staff were attentive to refill the tea.. Located at the hotel lobby of fairmont.. easily accessible by raffles train station.If possible do make a reservation before going down.
3
My friends and I decided to try the afternoon tea which was highly raved about in the media and everywhere else and we were pretty disappointed. Perhaps, we had read too many good reviews and were having exceptional high expectations only to find ourselves more dismayed than usual.The presentation of the food was pretty but frankly, we have eaten more afternoon teas of better quality. Given the price of the afternoon tea, I would not return again unless it's a treat. Too highly priced , I feel.
3
We celebrated a friend's birthday here. This has been a long overdue date with Anti:dote and we were really looking forward to it after seeing so many raves online.Pros: they were able to prepare a small cake with short notice. Appreciate that.Cons: We reached early and was asked to take a seat first while food was being prepared. Our drinks order was taken at 3.05pm. Fair enough since high tea starts at 3pm. I wanted my tea with sugar and milk and even after signalling them for 2 times and they acknowledged, nobody came. I was quite pissed and went up to the counter to request. However, when it came, there was only sugar, no milk, no teaspoon. I joked to my friends that the new way of stirring would be to shake it. Its now 3.20pm and we were still having only tea. The tables around us were starting to get the 1st dish. It was only when my friend who made a new order of drink that she also informed our selection of 1st dish. (Nobody asked and we were conveniently forgotten). Would we have even started eating at 3.30pm if nobody came over?1st thoughts when the instagrammable box came - it looked so worn out, pity. The savoury items were pretty nice. Others not so. Too sweet for my liking.I'll most likely not be back. There are better high tea places out there.
3
After having seen photo's of Anti:dote's sophisticated presentation of their high tea online, i was pretty excited to immerse myself in the experience.The level of service while lovely was somewhat slow and our experience was tarnished by the fact that our beautifully presented high tea offering was in a tattered and frayed looking presentation box. The corners where frayed and i felt highly embarrassed to show my high tea photos in the end to family and friends
3
Anti:dote is located at the Fairmont, the restaurant lacks a certain level of sophistication and ambience and we waited for approx 5 mins for someone to show us to our table that we had reserved. It took a long time for our High Tea order to be taken which they made up for with a free glass of Champagne and a sorry that it was taking so long! Now remember this is afternoon tea and the restaurant was half empty. The High tea itself was exceptional and we weren't disappointed which made upFor the poor service.
3
Summary: Come here if you don't mind paying for a shot of the instagram-worthy chest of drawers (it is very pretty I have to admit)Loves:- Very aesthetically pleasing chest of drawers filled with food- Very filling - most of us were unable to finish the food, and had to ask for the scones to be packed for takeaway- You can request for unfinished food to be packed- Pink Flamingo Tea (exclusive blend) was very fragrant and compliments the food (but Silver Moon is still my favourite TWG tea - not available at Antidote though)Can be improved:- No change of tea allowed; vs other high teas at comparable price points that do allow for at least 1 change of tea- Food wise, taste good but nothing outstanding and really memorable- Table was too small --> barely sufficient space for the food + tea- Inconsistent lighting - some tables had good lighting, but the light was really dim at our corner --> ie. hard for amateurs/ noobs like myself to take a good instagram shot (which is the whole point really
5
Great service and great smiles from the bar team. They were very attentive to our needs. A great place to drop in for a tipple or two!
3
An expensive place to stay too long. Service was slow and hard to attract attention of waiters. Part of the Fairmont hotel.
5
Singapore has an amazing cocktail scene, and Anti:dote makes some incredibly good ones. The food looked good too but I did t really eat there. Had a blast chatting cocktails with the friendly and professional bartenders at the bar.
5
Have been to this place few times and always had a positive experience. One of the best bars I've found in Singapore since bartenders are friendly and definitely expert in making good drinks. The bar ambient is nice & relaxing. Thanks for the good service!
5
The food are very nice. Only shortfall is too much sweet item. Having more savory will even out. The sweet items a little too sweet but overall still taste good. Tea selections are reasonably wide. Love the ambience and seats. Top on the list is the food display which is very, very awesome!
4
Staff at Fairmont Hotel had done a great job setting up for 10 Person high tea. Tea menu offered a reasonable selection and the food was beautifully prepared and stylishly presented. No one in our party was able to completely eat all servings given the quantity on offer. Would recommend to others. PS Not sure why Fairmont President Club membership was not offering added benefit

We had their High Tea lunch yesterday at Anti:dote located in the Fairmont Hotel in Singapore. This is held in a lobby looking like area (to the side of the main hotel lobby) and is somewhat open to the lobby and an entry way door to the outside car drop area. The hostess was helpful to arrange a table for us and the experience started.First you select your tea (or coffee I understand) from a list of traditional and other flavored teas (black, green, etc.). You can opt to pay a surcharge to add champagne to the meal. Next comes the appetizer, a choice between a seafood (cavier, fish egg mix) or dim-sum. The dim sum option was tasty and much more substantial than the seafood choice. Next comes the "box" which has three drawers. The bottom drawer holds dips; the second drawer holds two types of scones, and the third drawer has the selection of main entre finger food (salmon on cracker, some sort of tuna sandwich, etc. All of which, of course, or very dainty and fancy looking, but not very substantial in terms of quantity or subsistence. On top of the "box" is the selection of bite-sized desserts. This was the most well represented selection and filling.Service was, let's say, average. For such an expensive meal, in a unique presentations (e.g. old English high tea), in a very upscale hotel, you would expect only the best service. However we experienced wait staff which forgot to bring the water we requested for my daughter (who became a little vocal when she realized everyone received their tea and she had nothing to drink); we had to request a third place setting with silverware after they only provided two though they seated three adults; and wait staff which delivered the food efficiently but really didn't make you feel welcome or really seemed to care if you were there or not.Overall a unique way to enjoy high tea (and the tea and food was good), but it was just way too little food, and average service for such a commanding price to make me want to "experience" that again
3
We were staying at the Fairmont, and Antidote is the main hotel bar. Unfortunately, some of the drinks that were on the menu were not available, which was disappointing. The drinks that were available were prepared well. The music was too loud and a lot of the time, punk rock was being played?! This might be what you're after if you are a teenager in the middle of puberty, but in general, as a sophisticated adult, it's not fitting. Overall, an experience that is neither memorable nor particularly negative. It's somewhere in-between. If your goal is a quick drink, it's an acceptable option. Considering there's plenty of great bars in Singapore though, coming to Antidote once per lifetime is more than enough.
5
My husband and I had dinner plans but due to heavy storms we had to cancel. Anti:Dote was attached to our hotel and so we decided to try it. Fabulous! Food, drinks and atmosphere were exceptional. Would definitely go again. I'm glad our plans were cancelled and we discovered this place.
3
We stayed here for a week in this hotel. We visited the bar a couple of times to have a drink in the evening. The ambiente is very nice, everything well designed with nice furniture. Most of the staff are friendly. The team leads obviously avoid to serve the guests and stay in the background. A bit old fashioned and not very efficient and client centric
3
We were here for afternoon tea. The food was okay. Our table was close to the window but it didn't come with any view. Average ambience. Overall a decent experience.
5
I am a vegetarian and went anti:dote with 3 friends, there were able to change the savories into vegetarian. The portioning was just right and very worth while!
5
We were here pretty much every night. Bartenders are amzing, Gina took good care of us! All kinds of cool concoctions and decent snacks & music.
3
The bar offers nice collection of wines. the snacks are ok tasting. Not much of a variety. didn't find it the food or the ambience great.
5
After reading the recommendations for many High Tea venues we decided to visit Anti:dote at Fairmont Singapore. The selection is beautiful, delicate and offered lovely surprises as we debated what was hiding inside the desserts. Highly recommend. Don't worry about the location in the ground floor. You can see the Singapore vistas at sunset from a rooftop bar. Make your reservation for this treat.
5
We visited for high tea - it was sensational. All the items were very delicate and well presented and tasted amazing. The high tea is served in a jewellery box which is the most impressive display of high tea I've ever seen. There are lots of treats provided and you will leave very full and extremely satisfied.
2
We went for just a cup of coffee and a small bite to eat.From the moment we arrived, we felt as though we were an inconvenience. The coffee was of poor quality, mostly froth and EXPENSIVE. Two cups cost about $22 and nothing was offered to eat.Go up th road to Rocky Master. Much better value
3
Came here for afternoon tea with a girlfriend on a Wednesday afternoon. I'd heard a lot about the hightea here, so I went with high expectations, which unfortunately weren't met. While the food itself was quite nice, my friend and I both agreed that for what we paid, it wasn't worthwhile. The savoury items were probably the best part of the hightea, especially the mushroom vol-au-vent and duck pâté. Sadly, there weren't as many savoury items to choose from! There was more variety of sweet items, though (good if you have a sweet tooth). Unfortunately, after eating a few of the sweets, my girlfriend and I couldn't eat much more as they were overwhelmingly sweet. The yuzu tart was probably my favourite. Also, the options for tea were not as comprehensive - the tea selections that were covered by the hightea price were limited, while other options carried an additional charge. The service staff also informed us that we were only eligible for one refill of tea (rather ironic and stingy considering this is hightea and tea is drunk in rather copious amounts!). The service itself was nothing fantastic - I've been to many other places where the service is much warmer and more welcoming. I probably won't go back for afternoon tea, though I'm curious to come back in the evening for drinks as the reviews for the cocktails here seem to be much better.
5
If you're looking for craft cocktails that are designed for your flavor preferences and needs, Eugene at Anti:Dote is your man. The drinks and the ambiance are incredible and we can't wait to go back! Eugene is by far the best bar tender we have encountered in South East Asia!

We had a pretty disappointing experience at Anti:Dote for High Tea last week while in Singapore. The positives:Booking process was seamless and they were quick to confirm and reconfirmed via text.Lovely setting, beautiful high tea set up.We were quickly seated.The lemon curd, cream and jam were delicious. The negatives:We were the 3rd or so group to be seated and order for the afternoon. After 2 groups that ordered the appetizers after us were served before us I started to get annoyed. Then 3 more groups received their appetizers while we sat there, at which point I tried to flag down staff. When I finally got someone's attention, they went to check on our appetizers and returned 5 minutes later to say they were on the way. It was so disappointing because these are set appetizers, everyone orders the same things. Because of the wait my tea pot went quite cold so again I tried to flag down staff to request some water to no avail. I had to get up and go searching for someone. This was so frustrating. The food was really lackluster. The scones were tiny and dry and the sweets, while looking impressive, were not very enjoyable. I enjoyed at most, 2, of them. I would not recommend Anti:Dote for High Tea. The display may look good, but the food does not live up to the styling
3
The food here is sharing plates and they are amazing. The wine selection is goo however on the two occasions I visited several of the selections were not available due to 'supply issues'..
5
Drank here a couple of nights as it was attached to the Fairmont Hotel. The staff were great and the food nice.
1
The place was full when we arrived. I know we were late, but could you at least give us a call before giving up our reservation? We had to arrive in vain. I really don't expect such lousy service from a 5-star hotel!
5
Rye bourbon and all the lovely little things that make up a awesome old fashion.
I also enjoy the tapas available.
3
We went to Anti:dote for a coffee after dinner at Salt Tapas next door. The coffees were fine but just under $50 for 3 coffees and 1 hot chocolate is Ok for Singapore but really a silly price. But ok and decor is interesting and cool
5
As a guest in the Fairmont, I decided to have a night cap cocktail which spiralled into a 2 hour session with the barkeeper bringing me different special mixes of high quality gins with brands I had never heard of before- All delicious and powerful.. I wobbled off to bed and SG$ 140 less in my wallet but worth every drop <hiccup
3
I was staying at the Fairmont Hotel and had quite a number of business meetings at odd hours of the day. In a way, this small little eatery was just what is needed for a quick drink to discuss short businesses.The menu selection is good and if I had been a person who take alcohol, I suppose they have a wide variety that would appear to be pleasing. The bar looks nicely set up and the service appears fast. However, for SGD8 for a can of coke, one would not come here merely to quench their thirst but rather for the ambiance.It is rather nicely setup and there are comfortable lounges around the place that suits for a number of settings one my need. Only problem is that later in the evenings, the music can be a little loud and you may have to speak up a bit so that you can be heard. Therefore, it may not be very suitable for you if you really want to conduct in-depth business discussion. For me, this place is convenient and works well for a quick discussion when I am staying at the Fairmont, but would not be a place for me to come out of the way just for a drink

Last minute reservation, usually booked up weeks in advance especially at the weekend. The Anti-Dote is located in the lobby area of the Fairmont Hotel, very modern but elegantly decorated. Cosy table and comfy chairs perfect for a modern afternoon tea. Menu offered starters which are bought to the table prior to the main event. Our starters were a choice of Dim Sum or Egg with Sea Urchin. We chose both so we could try them. Not my cup of tea either of them but they were presented very well. My husband ate both and thoroughly enjoyed them. I personally think one of the starter options should have been more 'Western' style. There is also a selection of Teas to suit most taste and add a glass of Champagne for $SG15 - excellent valueThe starters and pots of tea are served together in a leisurely fashion. Then tables are cleared and the afternoon tea is bought to the table served in a large Jewellery box. The top tier is a masterclass of miniature desserts and chocolates, then a selection of savouries including lobster roll, Iberico ham tart, smoked salmon on rye bread, duck duxelle. Next drawer is a selection of scones and last drawer is clotted cream, home made lemon curd and raspberry jam. Everything is in a duo so no arguing with your partner over who is having which item. When they first bought the box to the table it was such a show stopper as it is very beautifully presented, everyone is taking photos.Each mouthful was beautiful, even items which I don't normally like (smoked Salmon). It could be said that the afternoon tea is heavily concentrated on a 'Sweat' side and could perhaps benefit from a few more savouries as I was overloaded and ended up having a goodie box taking the whole of the top layer of desserts back to the room for later.Service was very good but would have benefited from having a permanent member of staff hovering around the area checking to see if anyone needed anything; top up of tea, fresh drink etc.I did have to get up twice and go to the bar area to ask for more tea and milk/sugar as these were not on the table already.That said the afternoon tea was most enjoyable, a tempting selection of sweat and savouries. Would definitely recommend.Pros: Good value for the amount of food, Champagne is a good value addition, large amount of food, superb presentation, modern location, Cons: Need an extra clotted cream, too many sweat items, service could be a tad better; offering Tea top up/chang

Called for a last minute reservation for afternoon tea. Was fully booked but the restaurant managed to accommodate us last minute. Khrist welcomed us with a smile tho we came very early. Very accommodating. When we were seated at our table, Nancy came to us with her smile. Such a nice feeling to see staff smiling tho we feel they were busy. The food came and we were impressed! The egg with caviar and sea urchin! Love it. Overall, the experience is great! Khrist, Nancy and Adrian were very friendly and recommended places for us to visit around the hotel. We ended at introbar and cityscape. We will come back for sure for some tapas and great cocktails!

Have a Hi Tea session with my friends. They had 2 menu to choose with to start off oriental (dim sum or the scrabbled eggs with a little bit of sea urchin/ roes). The scrambled eggs came in with a nice egg shell container. The treasure box are full of surprises. Some of the cakes are on the sweet side. The savories came well and kind of balanced and matched with the sweet stuff. The whole place was packed with people or maybe those who are having afternoon tea seated an area. Nice and polite staff who went and explained the food on the box but a little bit slow in their service. Price is still reasonable. Thought we could finished the food but didn't managed it. If you would like a quiet afternoon tea with close friend. Not to worry what to eat. This is the place.
5
A lovely atmosphere with a range of cocktails available. Excellent bar staff; a very pleasant way to spend an evening.
4
A really comfortable place to have some nibbles the tapas and the cheese plate was excellent and the service was very good only complaint - the price.
1
Went for an afternoon tea session my kids. The service was surprisingly bad for a 5* hotel. A female service staff told us that we did not inform there were kids thus they did not prepare any kids set. We were bewildered as we did not ask for the kids set in the first place and the way she told us was like accusing us for not informing earlier when we made the reservation. When we asked her about the afternoon tea set, she just scornfully explained to us that a set was for 1 pax. Was thinking what we did to deserve such bad attitude.The food came in cute drawers but nothing to shout about. For such bad service, lousy attitude and expensive pricetag, we won't go back again
4
We stayed at Fairmont so we wanted to try the afternoon tea. We sat at the sofa right at the back but it wasn't comfortable as 2 of us had to sit on sofa stool. We ordered 4 sets for 5 of us which were more than enough. The service was slow; we waited for 30 mins for the food after our tea and coffee were served. Then when the food came, some of them were cold so we had to send them back. It is not cheap but overall, it is a very good afternoon set
5
Brought my mum here for the high tea on a Sunday afternoon. Though it was full capacity, you don't feel it as the seating are spaced out well and the arm chairs are so comfy. There were 2 seatings, from 12-2.30pm, 3-5.30pm. The server introduced the different sandwiches and canapÃ©s and even the mini desserts as well. She had a good knowledge of the tea selection and made some great tea recommendations based on what we like. The high tea set is one of the prettiest I have seen! It comes in a chest of drawers and you pull each drawer out to reveal the goodness in it. The pastries all complimented each other well. As there is a good selection of both sweet and sour pastries, you don't feel that you had to hold back on the deserts! I also liked the creative way of their plating of the scramble eggs.. In a black egg shell! Really cool!

Surprise by this small tiny bar. Surprisingly excellent service, food and cocktails.We are having salmon confit, beef brisket, chicken nugget and burnt corn taco. The chixken nugget is wonderful. Can't explain it. But it just wonderful. YUM! And the beef brisket is fantastic. Thise are out favorite among the other. And the cocktail is well executed. Definitely will come back whenever i return to Singapore anytime soon.
5
Great staff willing to make great cocktails and chat with you. I preferred their Singapore Sling to Raffles because it was made with almost the same ingredients but always freely made
2
The tea set came in a white drawer which looked fancy. But that was about as good as it got. The savoury stuff was okay but the sweet stuff looked childish and tasted below average. In fact, we only took a tasting bite for most of the sweet stuff and could not even bear to finish it. Definitely not coming back again.

I went there after booking one week in advance. This place don't accept walk-in customers for afternoon tea.The reason is simple: they have limited sets of drawers meant to store scone, savoury and sweets. They need to plan how many items based on numbers of customers.Order Oriental set . and teapot and dim sum were served first. main course consisting of savoury and sweet was served later.When drawer chest come, there are sweets on top, savouries in first drawer, scone in 2nd drawer, and jam, butter (for scone) and biscuit are in 3rd drawer.Many female customers went woo-haaa over cute drawer chest and took pics of the drawer and items inside.Over all, good experience and nice ambience.Tea menu are extensive. but for better tea , you have to pay more
5
Really? A hotel lobby you can't expect such an extensive menus of drinks. Service was top notch just like the drinks. Strong recommendation to the 15 year old tequila. I usually have patron gold but this was right up there. Next time you're close by don't judge the place by its cover....go there. You won't be disappointed.
5
Antidote is incredible. Had a night cab here and loved the charismatic and talented staff. The decor, music and service well above par. Kudos
5
One of the nicest cocktails I've had..... Only down side it that's it's called the Corpse Reviver. Great spot for people watching too.
5
The bar is absolutely fantastic - the drinks are creative and taste spectacular whole. They offer good food too and friendly service. Overall a really good experience.

Came with a friend for the afternoon tea. At $48+ it's certainly not cheap so I had high expectations. The location of the restaurant itself is interesting. You feel like you are in the lobby waiting area and are constantly distracted by people passing you by on one side to get to their room and arriving in cars in the hotel driveway on the other side. The afternoon tea set itself is beautifully presented in a chest of drawers. A very clever way to serve afternoon tea. However unfortunately it does not carry through to the food. The savoury selections were much better than the sweet. At least there was some flavour to the sandwich and tarts. The sweet selection was very disappointing. Everything just tasted 'sweet' with no actual flavours coming through. As someone who likes to bake I found this very disappointing and an indication of a sad lack of understanding of the palate on behalf of the chef. If you are going to charge that kind of price for a few small bites, it should be your priority to make sure that every one of those bites is bursting with flavour. I wouldn't recommend the afternoon tea here and would advise you to spend your $48 elsewhere
4
Had lunch here on my last day in country. Went for the Reuben & fries. Aside from the sauerkraut being stone cold in the sandwich, it was actually very nice & the fries were really good. Service was a bit slow but, not horrendously so and the price was reasonable
4
The afternoon tea was great! Had a good selection of savoury and sweet items to choose from and the presentation was excellent. The venue itself lacked character I felt and by being on the ground floor did not help. It felt more like a modern bar trying to play up to the concept of high tea. But I have attached pictures to demonstrate the artist side of the restaurant. For Singapore the price was fair, so I do recommend it those looking to entertain.
4
I always seem to have trouble booking the afternoon tea at Antidote even on weekdays, so try to book early if you really want to try it! The food was really delicious and I enjoyed the savoury ones more than the sweet items. Take the antidote tea set rather than the one with the dim sum as it's much nicer - the dim sum was a little too salty for me. Service was adequate but I had a hard time getting attention from the staff to get us more lemon curd and tea.
3
Was a bit disappointed with the afternoon high tea after highly recommended by my friend.Only the presentation set is interesting but actually nothing to wow about for the set. Two kinds of starter - Antidote starter which is a small cup of organic egg, caviar, salmon roe or can choose the dim sum starter. For the actual high tea set, it comes in a small drawer chests.Top tier are desserts, 2nd tier just some small sanwiches, 3rd tier scones and last tier are the spread such as jam etc. Overall there is nothing great. For the set at $48++ dont find it worth. There are other better high tea set at this price elsewhere with better selection than this
5
Usually I venture outside of the hotel I stay at for bars but I was feeling lazy and the Fairmont was amazing so what the heck. Turned out to be a great choice - bartenders here really know their stuff and their recommendations were on point! Try their #2 Gin drink :
4
Came here to try out the afternoon tea ; it was unexpectedly great! The appetiser was sea urchin with egg and salmon roe, tasty!Service was prompt, and presentation was great too. However it took a long time for the food to come ( about 40mins?) Nonetheless, I had a good time with my friend for the afternoon tea, and will come back agai
4
Recent makeover of the bar won't be to everyones taste but each night the bar is very popular. There seem to be more staff and more attentive service than I have seen previously and the finger food is lovely.
5
Vibrant buzzy and a great atmosphere. Great location. Good selection of food, drinks and menu cocktails. However try and secure a counter seat and talk with mixologists and tantalise your taste buds.
A great way to relax in the evening.

We had seen good reviews so decided to try this, but were disappointed almost from the beginning. Table for 3 people was very small and we waited 40 minutes before receiving any food. We had received tea but by the time the food arrived it had gotten cold (no tea cosines or warmers). Service was below standard - they were polite and seemed to want to help but appeared overmatched and undertrained. Our requests were acted on but we had to ask for everything - nobody ever came to check if we needed more hot water, fresh tea, etc., we always had to call someone over. Presentation is indeed nice and that is probably what drew some good reviews but the food quality was not special. That plus service are most important for us. Later on our trip we tried the Regent Tea Lounge and the difference was stark; Regent was outstanding and very professional. We would certainly choose the Regent again but not Anti: dote. And by the way, Anti: dote was more expensive
4
We had exactly 40 minutes to get to a show. The maitre D did not disappoint us. We had light beverage but the snacks came in good time and were super yummy - oysters, scallops, grilled fish, duck and salmon with roe were fantastic. I recommend it any time and we will be back soon
4
Huge list of delicious cocktails and the bar staff help you choose but asking what sort of thing you like. All seemed lovely. We had some tapas dishes one evening and they were stunningly tasty. My only negative was that on the two occasions we visited this bar was fairly empty and had very little atmosphere. However the cocktails make up for this you just need to make your own vib
3
After a hard day of touring and staying at the Fairmont it was good to find a bar to have a cool drink. Lots of business and convention people discussing their day which made it very loud, not their fault as they were enjoying themselves and we just needed a quiet corner
2
Went with family of four (2 kids) but given a a small table and cutlery wasn't even provided for the kids. How pathetic. Food came cold and very slow though waited for than 30min. Presentation looked decent and eye catching but can't compare to other hotel standard like Regent or Ritz Carlton. Service was lacklustre and felt wait staffs unwilling to serve as they didn't even bother to explain that only Easter Afternoon Set was available though menus (which contains the English or Oriental Sets) were provided. Overall a major disappointment and wouldn't recommend given the costly price tag at $55++ per person
2
Based on all the hype and reviews of their high tea, I went with great expectations and anticipation. I have to admit the presentation of the tea was interesting but the standard of the food was way disappointing. Having gone to countless High Teas this one was more hype than quality thus not worth the price at all. The area where were seated made it difficult for the servers to notice thus it took several tries before we even got their attention. Not a place I would go back again for a relaxing tea
5
If you want a cocktail, then Anti:Dote is an absolute must. The bar is situated on the ground floor of The Fairmont hotel on Bras Basah Road and is an absolute must if you want to drop in for a cocktail or three. We were treated to a first rate service by a cocktail waiter called Adrian: what a gent and very knowledgeable about his trade.
4
Myself and friend dropped into the bar here exhausted from our day and were greeted with a friendly smile and the menu. Two special Japanese men were making special cocktails and of course we tried them. Very happy letting them slide down the throat with some nibbles on the side....Would go back here again.....
4
Service was very prompt, great selections of old-school cocktails - which were nicely made. Sometimes you wished they have happy-hour so you can order more. Average price per drink is about $25.
Cozy environment makes this place a must-go for some after-work drinks.
4
We stop in for a drink and relax just before bed. But the bar was full most of the time. the staff were very nice.
4
- fun place to have an after-work drink
- great, cheery service and well-mixed cocktails
- have heard that they do a mean afternoon tea too.
5
Enjoyed a number of drinks here with family and bar staff made visit so enjoyable. Also has an excellent High Tea in the afternoon.
4
We had a official party at Antidote. The finger food was good spl the thin crust pizza. Nice place to sit and catch up with friends. No music though
4
They serve this lovely rose from Aix. Very refreshing. The food was nice and we had a good time, the ladies who waited on our group was very good. The Caucasian guy was not very friendly.
4
I have no comparison as this was the only one I drank during my visit to Singapore but after a week of hard work I felt I deserved to sample one before flying out. I was pleasantly surprised as I expected to be sweet and syrupy. It was sweet but not too much and the gin gave it a nice kick. Service faultless. Pricey.
1
It was one of the worst experience at a five stars hotel. We wanted to use the fairmont president club e-certificates and had to repeatedly tell the staff during reservation, upon ordering, at payment and asked twice for the printout of e-certificates. The lounge staff explained that they are very busy and please try to understand. The duty manager was very willing to listen to us but I would definitely not return to the lounge again
4
There are 2 kind of afternoon tea set for you to choose. We decided to choose one of each set so we can try them. Each set cost $45++.If you like truffle, choose Black truffle scrambled eggs. Its delicious and we loved it. The dim sum also tasted not bad but preferred Black truffle scrambled eggs. The set may not have alot of variety but we cannot finished all. the sweet dessert was really sweet which I don't really like, the rest was fine. There is a cookie for you to bring home if you cant finished it. The ambiance was very good for us to chit chat and chillax for hours. Worth to try it
3
Whilst this is a nice cafe don't bother with coffee as it is a rip off $9.00 a cup. You should go across the road to Ah Teng Bakery at the Raffles Hotel - they do a brekky special for $10.90 with excellent danish (Blueberry crumble was gr8), coffee and cold drink
5
Fantastic desserts that accompany the high tea, was surprised that some of the staff didn't know some of the items on the menu and i was served swine which i am prohibited from eating, nevertheless i will be returning soon.
4
Nice place to have a drink and small food when you don't want to venture out of the hotel. They make a little pizza that is just divine! Try to catch Happy Hour when drinks are half price.
3
The reason we decided to try out this high tea was because of how the pastry items were served in a chest of drawers. The variety was good and filling, but the scones were not even warm. The staff were attentive but not friendly and warm; they could have smiled more.
2
I'd heard of this place, and as I was making my way towards the city centre I knew that it was just around the corner, so I decided to take a little detour and check it out. Well, it certainly isn't my type of bar, namely because it is adjoined to a really fancy hotel, which means that bar itself is a really fancy bar. I'm much more of a down to earth type of person, which means that extravagance really doesn't impress me. Still, I was here so I decided that I would go in and have a drink. The staff were okay, but the thing was that I felt a little underdressed. They also had these really uncomfortable looking bars next to some of the tables that you lean against. Really, I like to sit down when having a drink, not lean, but I guess some people prefer that. However, they had a decent selection of beers on tap, and I ended up having an American beer that I had never seen before (namely because I have never been to the United States). Still, it's not really my scene
3
Was tempted by the lovely display put up in Raffles City and made a reservation for 3 adults and 1 child. Arrived on the dot and were served our tea very soon but the food arrived only half an hour later.We were seated at the sofa right outside the door to the kitchen and we could not help but notice the empties piling up at the counter of other guests' starters... after we drank 20 mins of tea.The food was definitely Instagram worthy but taste wise not up to expectations. Best was the truffled egg though the buttered toast fingers apparently sat there for too long before they got to meet us.Ginger and raisin scones were good, though not even warm; sandwich spread OK but some slightly soggy at the bottom.Desserts were really pretty and there was an interesting mixture of sweetness n tartness. More importantly, they did not suffer much from the wait.The disappointment was obviously related to the delay in service that affected the quality of the food. I don't mind waiting for food freshly prepared, but it wasn't the case at Anti:dote that afternoon
5
The antidote has been upgraded to serve Tapas with its drinks.We went for High Tea which was excellent although too much to eat.We also went just for coffee after dinner.We also went for Tapas and Cocktails.All occasions were extremely well served by the friendly and attentive staff, who were not intrusive but noticed when you had finished your drinks and may need replenishment.Not cheap but certainly affordable and well worth the visit
5
We attended the high tea for lunch for my daughter's birthday. The presentation is second to none and we loved the uniqueness of the jewellery boxes. We had the oriental set which included a dim sum entrÃ©e whilst the kids had the childs set. We were amazed when the food came out that the child's set is almost identical. We all enjoyed food and atmosphere and would recommend it for a special occasio
3
Its a place in the ground floor of the Fairmont hotel - its OK - they do about 15 fast dishes like Caesar Salad etc and they serve alcohol, of course. Its confortable and fine for a quick snack if you are staying in the hotel but not worth a special visi
4
Me and my friends we went there for the high tea because of the drawer concept they have. We found that is pretty interesting. Most of the high tea I attended is buffet style but Anti:dote is set which means the items are fixed. It depends on how many people dining then they will bring the group drawer out. We are in a group of 3 so all the stuff is at one drawer and looks really good. Environment is good partly because this is 5 stars hotel and all the interior designs have the standards. I feel like Tai Tai when I am seated.How is my high tea set looks like and the taste. You are able to choose any tea or coffee from the selected menu. Some premium tea you have to pay extra for that.Top level - all the sweet stuff. There are few items like the tart I like it a lot. The chocolate is average to meMiddle Level - all savory stuff. I love all of them, there is one or two which is really super nice, but not many choices.Bottom Level - the scones and biscuit. The biscuit they packed nicely so that you can bring back home if you can't finish it. My friends like the scones a lot but I did had better else where so that is average to me too.How about the price? It costed us $53(including all the taxes), which is quite expansive for a high tea set. However, if you are high tea fan, you should try at least once for it. Overall, the experience is quite good
5
Had high tea at Anti:dote one afternoon at the Fairmont Hotel lobby. Make sure you book at least the day before otherwise you won't get in. We actually shared a high tea and it was more than adequate for an afternoon bite. The high tea set consists of 2 scones with condiments (jam, cream, lemon curd), 5 savouries - a curry chicken tart, a quiche, a duck, salmon and lobster dish.There was around 7 sweets, a chocolate truffle, chocolate strawberry, a macaroon, a strawberry cake, chocolate cake, cheesecake, and another one like a vanilla slice.Like all high teas these are pretty much bite size, ie. one or two bites. We cut each into halves and it was more than enough to fill us with tea. The presentation of the high tea was excellent - it was in a high tea box, a three tiered box with drawers, the savouries were in one draw, the scones in another, the condiments in another and the sweets on top. Hadn't seen anything like this before, completely different to the usual high tea stands.Highly recommended
5
Cocktails, knowledge of mixologist. Helpful and attentive. A great range of les well known but brilliant spirits.
5
A fantastic cocktail bar in the heart of Singapore. The bartenders really know their craft and care about making top notch cocktails. It felt like being at home it was so friendly. Highly recommended.
4
Lovely decor. Good selection of drinks. A little pricey. We were a big group in the evening but it seemed to get quite busy.
3
Seating layout does not make it easy for groups to sit comfortably and chat.No replenishment of nibbles when extra members joined the group.Be careful when going to bathroom, it appeared a unisex room, unfortunately the gentleman using it when I arrived had not shut the door, he apologized for using the ladies, not really easy to know if I was in gents or he was in ladies
4
The High Tea seems to be a highlight - it is a visual delight to see the staff dress up the high tea chests with love and affection! The place has a wide range of teas, coffees and some juices. Perfect place for conversations in the afternoon
4
If you love afternoon tea, you gotta try Anti:dote! They offer the tea set daily ($45++ per pax) but you'd need to book in advance because they are almost always full!! Instead of tiers or buffet spread, Anti:dote tea pastries/sandwiches are served in darling little drawers. These little drawers are filled with surprises and treasures that will made you go 'mmmmmm~~~'
3
Decor and fitout are second to none, and while also the food is very well priced and extremely nice....there is a serious failure in their menu presentation, both in printed format and verbal communication, or non-communication thereto.That is, while its expected that drinks are generally expensive in SG, one might assume that when they are 'significanlty more' expensive, even above SG standards, that such should be communicated to clientele, preferrably by inclusion on the written menu, but especially verbally if not so included.So, a bitterly expensive, and common white wine, bittered what would otherwise have been a nice snack at midday.Beware of un-disclosed drinks prices....a bit deceptive indeed :
4
Nice cozy place for afternoon tea. They don't have many tables, so advisable to make your reservations early. We tried both the Anti:dote and Oriental tea set. Exquisite. They were beautifully displayed in a 3-tier drawer. They also have a nice selection of tea. Highly recommend the Tibetan Black tea.
4
I stay here during layovers on company duty. Tonight I tried the ANT:IDOTE bar in the lobby as I particularly fancied a cocktail. I should point out that I am very fond of cocktails. A great way to leave your inhibitions behind without the bloating and headaches of beer. On duty was Mixologist Chris. He made me an exquisite caipirinha, followed by a Sazerac, and a number of beautifully crafted cocktails, with a subtle knowledge of the tastes and bases required for a discerning palette. I cannot recommend this bar highly enough if you love an intelligently mixed cocktail. Chris let me try some amazing gins before I decided on my drink. He knows his stuff and can mix you any cocktail you desire. Even if you're not staying at the hotel, I reco you try a few cocktails here. You won't be disappointed
5
after a disappointing trip at tess bar & kitchen, we walked down to Antidote which was 5mins away for a night cap. this place was unbelivable. the food was well presented and tasted flavorful. the cocktails was strong and well thought up. only we feel like the place is a lounge
4
We didn't eat here but had a nice glass of wine while waiting for friends. It's in the lobby of the Fairmont Singapore and though the prices are a little high (like everything in Singapore) we enjoyed the respite.
5
Excellent staff, drinks and gorgeous decor. Loved coming down for pre-dinner drinks every evening...
5
My husband and I enjoyed a Saturday afternoon tea here and were very impressed. The tea selection was fantastic, it's served is quirky drawers and everything was so yummy. The staff were very friendly and took the time to explain everything. A great treat
5
Beautiful experience in Anti:dote, very good food&coktails. Don't forget the opportunity to dinner there if you will visit Singapur. The catalan chef Carlos Montobbio will suggest you the better tapas they cook.
5
As good foodies, my wife and me enjoy discovering new restaurants in Singapore. This is because we decided to make a tour for the five restaurants with nominees Rising Chef of the Year for WGS (Anti:dote, Artichoke, Dibs, Morsels and Saha).We started for Anti:dote, what is more a cocktail bar than a restaurant. Actually, most part of the reviews never talked about the food... which actually is even better than the cocktails there!Carlos Montobbio is the young Spanish Chef that created the menu. Dishes are small, so they are not very expensive. I don't understand the reason behind, but food here looks like secondary, focusing on drinks and cocktails. Big mistake, because, even if the cocktails are good, the food is really amazing. We tried almost everything, and we enjoyed every single dish! It is molecular cuisine, with awesome presentations in some cases (pizza, i.e.), but also tasteful and with a logic. Because molecular cuisine is not supposed to be only chemistry, or magic, it has to be nice food. And in Anti:dote, it is.Carlos Montobbio is a very promising Chef, and I am yearning to continue my route for these five restaurants because I am pretty sure that Artichoke, Dibs, Morsels and Saha will keep the level up
4
Had a champagne truffle hi-tea set and its was served in a lovely photo-worthy jewellery chest - like other multi-tiered hi-tea display, it saves table space. However, it keeps me wondering how thorough do they clean the drawers - opps! Scones were on the last drawer lined with nice napkins. There is a nicely wrapped lolly-cookie too! There was a nice selection of tea that you can choose from - like most hi-tea places in Singapore, you need to pay extra for premium teas. Well occupied on a Monday afternoon, I was ushered to the back where its more 'undisturbed' - good for spending a relaxing afternoon. Served by a friendly Korean waitress
5
My daughter brought me here for afternoon tea as a treat for Mother's Day. It was absolutely wonderful, and all served in a jewellery box - quite unique. Lots of open sandwiches, warm scones and then the yummy desserts. All washed down with a glass of Veuve Cliquot ....Highly recommende
4
If you are in the hood and looking for craft cocktails before dinner, Tom is your man and Antidote is your place. Here for a conference so it's hard not to stop in each evening. Service is a bit slow, so don't come if you are in a hurry.
4
It was an escape from work in one of the week days. I love the concept , the combination of jewellery box and dessert. Great presentation, food is good, staff are friendly. Definitely good for lovers and girls talk. Have a goal, at least once if u r after a extrodinary high tea experience !! Reservation is a must on weekend.

Stumbled upon this quaint bar and lounge when returning from dinner one evening as we were staying at the Fairmont (bar is connected to the hotel). We were pleasantly surprised by the variety of drinks and very inventive cocktails. Upon sitting at the bar, we were promptly greeted by the friendly bartender who was forthcoming in offering recommendations and popular items on the menu. Our drinks were made with care and precision and tasted delicious. We were even given complimentary bar snacks, as well as advice on where to purchase authentic Singaporean liquors. Upon further research, I was surprised to read other reviews condemning the service. We had absolutely nothing but the best service, which was friendly, fast, and very accommodating. This is the ideal location for anyone looking for a refreshing cocktail or nightcap. I would highly recommend Anti:dote to any locals or travelers
4
the cocktails are well executed and balanced. bartenders are knowledgeable and able to recommend a drink. service can be improved though as we had to wait quite for someone to take our orders.
5
Really nice atmosphere, lovely decor. Fantastic cocktails. Tom really knows his stuff, and if you're in when it's a bit quieter he's a really nice, engaging guy to have a chat with. Would heartily recommend to all who are in the area!
5
The staff stop and chat, giving directions or advice on things to do. Wine list is very good, however being Singapore, is very expensive based on international standards. Relaxing atmosphere. Could easily let the night melt away enjoying a few drinks.

This was my first high tea experience. Not the greatest service or friendly face at the entrance. Some of employees were genuinely nice, but the hostness or whoever seated us, not so much. Due to my Fairmont Gold status, I had $50 USD in credit that I was told I could use anywhere in the hotel restaurants and I was given a pretty hard time about being able to use it here. Three of us arrived at 3pm when high tea starts and were told they were already out of the Oriental Tea menu, meaning no dim sum appetizer. They wound up bringing one out, and two of the other sets. I'm not sure why the confusion, but I'm glad we got to try both. The dim sum was great as was the truffle scrambled egg, the finger foods pretty tasty, the tea was interesting and the desserts were not bad. I'm not sure I'd do it again considering it's somewhat spendy, but it's a fancy way to spend an afternoon in a upscale hotel in a nice part of town

Together with a friend we visited Anti:dote on a Tuesday evening in November 2014. We ordered a bottle of expensive red wine and asked for some snacks. We were told that the kitchen was already closed. And indeed, we had entered the restaurant after the kitchen was closed. We asked if we could have at least some peanuts, chips or any snacks to have with our expensive bottle of wine. After checking with her boss the waitress came back with the message that she could not offer anything to eat except some very spicy almonds, not even some peanuts or other snacks. There were plenty of other guests around at that time. As Anti:dote is part of the large Fairmont Hotel in Singapore, we were extremely disappointed that despite the order of an expensive bottle of wine no snacks whatsoever were offered and no efforts were made to give us something to eat with the wine despite various requests. As the kitchen was closed we did not expect a meal but just something small with the wind. Finally, we took the bottle to our room, took snacks out of our mini bar and drank the wine in the room. We will certainly never again go to Anti:dote
1
I'm not sure if it's because I'm not a typical "white customer" that the girls in the bar are prone to sucking up to (for whatever weird reason), but my experience at this place can only be best described as exasperatingly bad. After we sat down we were presented with a bar menu, but as we were only looking to have a nice cup of after-dinner tea, the waitress snapped back and almost literally snatched the bar menu I was still looking at and came back with the tea menu. When paying the bill, it felt like I was scorned and looked down upon because we only ordered tea, which made us feel like we were not good enough for the establishment. A very empty establishment on a Sunday night. It leaves very little to the imagination why there aren't more people coming to this place to relax after dinner! CAN THE MANAGEMENT PLEASE WAKE UP AND EITHER RETRAIN YOUR STAFF, OR SEND THEM BACK TO WHERE THEY CAME FROM!!!
5
My husband and I were staying at the Fairmont right next door so the distance was extremely convenient. We were waiting for a tour and Anti:dote started their "thirsty hour" at 12:30pm :) Great tapas and service. If in Singapore, I would definitely stay here again.
5
What an absolutely wonderful bar. Forget that it is a hotel bar. This is just a great bar, period. The bartenders make fabulous cocktails and truly understand the characteristics of different liquors and how they interact to make a complete flavor profile. They are also obviously passionate about what they do and share their knowledge with customers. We spent a Friday night enjoying different mixed drinks here and had such a fun experience chatting with head bartender Tom that we had to come back Sunday night, when we were helped by another bartender who was equally as fantastic. The bar food is also great - spiced nuts come complimentary with drinks and the chef has put together some solid small bites. We will come here every time we're in Singapore whether we stay at the Fairmont or not
5
We had afternoon high tea at Anti:dote and the chest of high tea was fantastic. Very unique setting and the high tea was absolutely sensational. The high tea at Anti:dote was very different to other high teas as the presentation of high tea does not come in 3-tiered platters but instead, comes in a chest, beautifully laid out. Highly recommended for anyone to try out this afternoon tea - SGD$38++ per person.Must make reservations as they only have limited number of ingredients and spaces for afternoon tea each day. The Assistant Manager, Amose, is very friendly and has excellent customer service skills. We even saw Kristen Stewart (Bella from Twilight) having a few drinks with her mates at Anti:Dote as she is staying in Fairmont Singapore for a month. Good place to enjoy afternoon tea - for locals or overseas visitors
5
Recently visited Singapore and this restaurant was based in our hotel, being the Swissotel Samford. A Tapas type bar very retro and great music. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The food was amazing. Very different choices of food like I've never had before. Was a great experience. We had a stop over on our way to Europe and back and both times ate at this restaurant. The manager remembered us from our first visit 2 weeks before. I was impressed. Just loved it
4
Trendy but slightly expensive menu for what you get. That is made up by the great service. Chrislie was excellent!
5
Friendly, great service, chill and people watch and chat with friends. Expensive, but so is everything in Singapore!
5
Love the original drink menu. I have never tasted cocktails like these before. One a day is plenty, they are very strong drinks
4
Liked the atmosphere in here- very chic .
Wished I had dressed up a little more but we went straight after depositing our luggage and belongings in the room after our late arrival . Classy

MARVELLOUS ANTIDOTE!The audacious and irrepressible Travelling Gourmet goes to Raffles City in sunny Singapore where...MANY do not know of this wonderful spot for Afternoon Tea, creative cocktails and other epicurean delights like Tapas. The newly renovated Anti:dote Bistro and Bar on level 1 of the Fairmont near the Lobby is very chic and cool.Have a ball! Fairmont's Lobby...The Afternoon Tea from 3pm to 6pm is outstanding! Helpful and friendly Assistant Manager, Amose Chong, brought me to my comfy sofa seat from where I could admire the futuristic rectangular amber chandelier. They have a very good Tea selection like Pink Flamingo which is a blend of Green Tea and fragrant crimson Hibiscus petals. Holiday in Paris has rare white Yin Zhen Tea blended with Vanilla. For that caffeine kick there is coffee too like Latte and Macchiato.Egg & "Soldiers"The Amuse Bouche that precedes the Afternoon Tea is a humdinger! A gigantic white porcelain egg opens up to reveal an egg shell filled to the brim with Scrambled Egg and topped with a disc of addictive Black Truffle and Spanish Per Se Brand Organic Sturgeon Caviar... The heady aroma of truffle almost made me swoon in delight...Beside it are three chunky 'soldiers' or batons of ueber-crispy hot buttered toast to dip in to the egg. It was love at first bite! Super Yummie!The Three Drawers...J'adore the alluring Anti:dote Tea served in a huge and impressive white leather Jewellery box with three drawers! They also have the Oriental Tea with Tim Sum like Shrimp Har Kow. If you are partial to Champagne, then the Regal Tea with one glass of Champagne is ideal for you.Energetic Head Chef Carlos Montobbio, 27, from Barcelona in Spain explained the contents to me. In the first drawer, there was Lobster Roll , Smoked Salmon with Creme Fraiche and Caviar, Proscuitto with Aged Cheddar and Onion Jam Canape, Herb Mayonnaise Cucumber and Dill Salad and spicy Coronation Curried Chicken Tart! The cucumber is actually a concentrated Cucumber Gelee for a more intense flavour.The second drawer opened to reveal Candied Ginger and Raisin Scones plus a chunky lemon and Basil Pound Cake. I was pleased to find nice brunoise of spicy-sweet candied ginger inside the Scone. The Raisin Scone has lots of raisins! I detest Raisin Scones where there are only one or two raisins inside where the Chef has been very "kiam siap" (stingy).In drawer number three were cute little pots of Creme Fraiche, home-made Strawberry Jam and Lemon Curd plus a nicely wrapped Biscuit for you to bring home for later! How good is that!Displayed on the glass topped Jewellery Box was a tantalising and irresistable array of sweet treats called Petit Desserts. Pretty Yuzu Macaron, Cute Strawberry Gateau like a sweet Sushi roll, Green Apple Delight with a dome of Granny Smith Apple, Almond Crumble, Earl Grey Tea Eclair, sexy Anti:dote Baba au Rhum and...the "Piece de Resistance" Karukera Chocolate Mirror Tarte! It is made with Cocoa from the Karukera Islands of Guadeloupe sprinkled with "crumbs". Karukera means "the islands with beautiful waters". The glossy shimmering caramel coloured chocolate disc is absolutely delicious! I also love the Baba au Rhum which has a little pippette so you can squeeze MORE Captain Morgan's Dark Rum into your Baba before you savour it! What a good idea!I had to take a break to let all that beautiful food digest before carrying on with...Cocktails and TAPAS TimeThe dapper Head Craftsman/Mixologist Tom Hogan creates the most unique cocktails and even makes his own bitter tonics from a variety of ingredients like Wormwood Root used to make Absinthe, Licorice Root, Orange Peel and more. Cheerful Tom was born in New York but later moved to Chicago. Brown Derby is a bit sweet as it has honey, grapefruit and Bourbon. The name reminded me of the Cobb Salad in Florida at the restaurants of the same name. Promintory point is "powderful"!! :-) Sherry, Angostura Bitters, Sweet Vermouth, Yelow Chartreuse, Orange Bitters and Cognac in a Martini glass! Beware...it has a Potency of 5 out of 5.A rather herbal concoction is Treat of Kings! Tarragon, Mint and Pineapple combine harmoniously with Soda Water and sour Pisco. I also recommend the Gin & Tonics here.. they are excellent and most refreshing!I really like the so-called "Fake Pizza"...What in heaven's name is that, you ask? Simply put the "Parmesan Pizza" is simply...a base of shredded Parmigiano cheese lightly fried for one minute till super -duper CRISPY. Topped with red "earth" of Tomato Pesto, white 'cheese' crumbs of Basil Cress and Olive oil "Caviar"! My friend, Susie Lim calls it the "Fake Pizza". It is a typical Molecular Gastronomy Deconstruction/Reconstruction dish! It will BLOW your mind! Yum! Yum! Chef Carlos kindly explained all the various components to me: "The red powder are dried tomato flakes. The pesto is normal pesto, is the small green dots around the pizza. The basil cress are the small basil leaves in the pizza. The white powder that looks like cheese is fried garlic and parsley oil powder."A delightful Thai inspired goodie is the Tofu made with peanuts and thickened with the Japanese Kuzu Root. This ancient thickener or jelling agent lets the flavours coat all your taste buds in an instant as it melts when it is warmed up in your mouth! Used in Japan for over 400 years, it is also medicinal in nature and can heal minor aches and pains as well as indigestion! On top of the "Tofu" is brunoise of raw Hokkaido Scallop. The combo of fresh marine flavours and peanutty earth nuances goes well together. The "Tofu" swims in a broth of chilled chilli hot Tom Yam!Caramelized Foie Gras! Vinegar glazed Leeks is a good accompaniment foiled with crisp Puff Pastry. The rich earth taste of Foie Gras is always so delicious with its mushroomy nuances!After Anti:dote's fabulous food and lovely drinks, I was refreshed and rejunvenated and ready for another great day! When the poisonous stresses of life in Singapore impact you...simply adjourn here for your antidote! :-) ENJOY life

For full review & photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/09/afternoon-tea-at-antidote-80-bras-basah.htmlAnti:dote at the newly refurbished Fairmont hotel, is a stylish and modern cocktail bar that has recently launched the new afternoon tea daily from 3-5pm.They presented the high tea items with a mini dresser which is very cool right? The service here was average as the staff were not very attentive, have to try a few times to catch their attention. But they were very polite and made an effort to explain to us what are the high tea items. The latte here was very premium quality, the roasted coffee smells very good! My partner told me this was the BEST latte among so many hotels! So do try their latte when you're there! I would say this is probably 1 of the BEST high tea that you should try

Anti:dote is a newly refurbished bar in the Fairmont Hotel, Singapore. The tapas offerings are under the control of a wonderful, young chef from Spain, Carlos Montobbio. Each course is a clever mix of Spanish, Asian and Euro cuisines - tapas with a multicultural twist. Cooking styles are also an interesting mix of traditional, artisan and molecular. It is the best tapas I have eaten - intense flavours and textures presented with whimsical, visual humour. The anchovy sticks, caramelised foie gras and mini-pizza [ not what you think!] were stunning. Carlos serves each course personally and enthusiastically explains his concept without becoming a food geek. Do try it if in Singapore

This place is a very welcome addition to the hotel bar & restaurant scene in Singapore since it not only offers an innovative drinks menu (great cocktails and spirits), but also very good food. The atmosphere is modern and chic, yet still relaxed and welcoming with many interesting little "twists" in the interior design concept. Anti:dote looks fresh and urban at it's best - yet does not exude any kind of "too cool for you" vibe which you can find in many "in bars". The friendliness of the staff and the excellent product quality offered at reasonable prices also is recommendable. Anti:dote is cosmopolitan lifestyle chic combined with great drinks and food in a very relaxed, but still welcoming atmosphere. A great find for any weary traveler, and a cool place to hang out with friends, colleagues and family as well. LOVE IT

Speed in here as a typical downpour prevented me from crossing the road to Raffles to sit in the Long Bar. What a lovely surprise. Drinks not to outrageously expensive which seems to be the norm in Singapore. Tapas was top quality and fine dining style but delicious with fabulous service. The waitress suggested the food according to the wine I ordered. Lovely if a bit exposed to the front door but really relaxing!
