The ambience is nice, service is good, food in general is ok. The lobster noodle is grossly over rated.
5
the price is very reasonable and food is really good.
their hashima is very good. the service is very fluke and this time it was actually really fast and good.

The dim sum is simply to die for. Must order the char siew pastry. One of the best in SG. XO carrot cake; siew mai, century egg congee.

While pictures paint a thousand words... but it does not describe when I experience or feel. So I always prefer to spend time to share in writing After trying out the two restaurants owned by the same group in Shanghai recently (four seasons and royal china), I organized a lunch for a group of 5. I was initially skeptical of what to expect as I find that fine Chinese dining in Singapore tends to fall short when compared to those in HK, Taiwan, Shanghai or Guangzhou. (I don't like fine Chinese dining in Beijing in general). It is very rare that I would praise a restaurant to such an extend, Royal China at Raffles is really very good. I tried only the dim-sum (点心）and I have to say that it is definitely most of the best in town. I love their Bao-zi (包子) especially (雪山包，流沙包), are particularly. Only the 小笼包 and 肠粉 are not outstanding. I am sorry that I have to write the names of the food in Chinese. The truffle dumpling has a strong aroma of truffle oil while the texture of the buns (包）is very fine yet not too soft and it is not chewy to indicate the freshness of it. I will skip the rest of the dishes (fish maw, chicken feet) I have tried as I know these are not meant for everyone's liking. what is really impressive is that the chopsticks provided matches the concept of eating Chinese dumplings... which shows they make efforts to understand the meaning of an authentic style Chinese dining. Fine dining Chinese restaurants in Singapore provides better # restaurant service compared to western restaurants in general. Attitude of service staff tends to be more proactive than western style restaurants I have experienced here. Royal China is no exception to that, as the service staff are very attentive. Yes, it is not cheap, but it is worth it. Worth an experience considering it is located in a historic building as well. This is an area I feel that #customer service in Singapore F&B industry (especially among cafes, western style restaurants ) needs to upgrade as they lack their counterparts in many Asian cities despite the fact customers are charged 10% service fee (with or without proper service)

Royal China is tucked away on Level 3 of Raffles Hotel. We had Dim Sum on a Sunday morning and reservations are recommended. I enjoyed the food tremendously but my friends commented that the restaurant has seen better days when even the food tasted better. My friends and i were seated in a corner, almost like a private room. We enjoyed it until there were other tables where families brought babies along and they were getting a bit too noisy. Having such luxurious space, my suggestion is to place families who requires baby seats and have prams to be seated together in the same private dining room. It will be less noisy for the children and the wait stuff will be able to focus better when they are serving these tables. For big tables of friends like ours, it would also mean that we don't have to speak softly, afraid that it might affect the sleeping babies or children. Overall, i would visit again for the good food that is value for money

The go to place for quality dim sum in Singapore - make sure that you make a booking as it gets very busy on the weekends. 2 seatings for lunch on Sunday and peking duck is a must order (if you want to try something else then order the aromatic duck instead
4
Attended for dinner but did not know what to make of the restaurant when you enter and see a torn decorative mural and really tacky turquoise decor. To make it worse for such a large dinning room, we were the only patrons at 8.30 on a Friday night. Sometimes you don't know whether to run away politely excusing ourselves or to face what potentially could be a terrible dinner if the decor was any representation of the food. Nevertheless we were fussed over by the numerous wait people with nothing to do.Surprisingly the food was very good with generous serves. The aromatic duck was a little dry but otherwise a very enjoyable meal.Pity the skill of the chef was not complemented by the decor. Ignore the decor and the food is actually very tasty. The price was right up there as expected being in the Raffles

A nice location nestled in the Raffles Hotel. I found right from the outset the service mediocre. ..the toilets too far and closed and staff could not help...then service and flow although quick the smiles were missing. Food was good..and the desert superb. ..needs a few tweeks and it will get there..
3
Food is still good - the XO carrot cake, the prawn cheong fun. BUT the service is AWFUL. 2 seatings on 1 Jan lunch - 1130 to 1 pm or 1.30-3pm. We opted for the first. The day before I received a reminder call, that my lunch rsvn is from 11.30-12.45 pm, I told the staff that in my initial reservation I was informed that the slot is from 11.30-1 pm (and not 12.45 pm). The staff said 1 pm is ok. We arrived at the restaurant on time, very conscious that our lunch time is limited. To our dismay, we had to wait 10 min for our food order to be taken as the server "has to prepare out tea first". She had taken our tea order and walked away immediately, even though we were ready to order. We placed additional orders later, but each attempt it was a brush off saying that she will return, even before we hv finished speaking. She did return. It is brusque efficiency. At 12.15 pm, she told us it is the last order. And we had to place our dessert order. We had barely eaten and certainly not even looked at the dessert menu! We decided not to eat dessert there as we didn't want to rush through what is supposed to be a nice dim sum lunch w friends. At 12.45 pm, she presented us with the bill (before we asked), and told us that time is up, I told her that our slot is until 1 pm. Altogether the experience with the server is extremely unpleasant, spoiling what would hv been a lovely lunch. Unfortunately for all 5 of us, we left the restaurant with the memories of this hurried lunch rather than the delicious food. (Not sure if it is 2 seatings through all lunches or just for festive occasions, better to go for 2nd seating if one does want to eat here, or just eat at Wah Lok or Lei Garden, all near by & good food though).

One of the better restaurants serving Dim Sum Singapore. Must try - Roasted Pork. It comes in a very small plate; portion is small but the roast pork is one of the best you find. Service staff may give you attitude issues sometimes but if treat them well, you may be reciprocated with some attention. Price is steep here
5
The standard of food, especially Chinese, is very high in Singapore. The Royal China is an elegant and luxuriously-appointed space, with quality food to match.
4
Went on 3rd May to have an early Mother's Day celebration.
Service was reasonable. Food was served promptly.
Main attraction is the dining experience cause of the ambience
4
Relatively cheaper than Wah Loh & Imperial. Some dishes are not as nice as other Branded dim sum restaurants. Great service & I like the ambience. Please bring jacket or shawl as it's freezing cold in the restaurant!
3
Our recommended wine was far too sweet and we left three quarters of the bottle - not that anyone made any comment. Food was average and staff seemed stretched. There was a function going at the same time in the restaurant though
3
The dumplings were so so. The Peking Duck with caviar was delicious. Service was terrible. We had reservations at 1:15 and sat down at 1:35. Had as twice for the real to be refilled. Wait staff was more concerned to clean vacant tables at 2:15 then provide good service
4
This restaurant in the Raffles Hotel is dressed up in chinoiserie decor with predominant use of the elegant colour of Tiffany blue. The nice ambience and generally good Chinese food makes it popular for entertaining and celebrations. Service is good with a dedicated wait staff for each table. Their attentiveness and the elegant surroundings will make you feel like a royalty.Advance reservation is highly recommended as It is usually packed (even for lunch) with hotel guests or those from nearby offices hosting business meals

It's been 5-6 years since I've last been here. The decor and furnishings look worn. Indeed the foam centerpiece at the entrance looks torn in multiple places as if a tiger clawed its way through the foam. The staff at the entrance also was also rude as she curtly told me to wait by showing me her palmWe ordered a variety of dim sum. The good - pork buns, carrot cake, chicken feet. The average - pipa duck, pork ribsOverall I can see why this place has garnered an average reputation since it opened 15 years . It is no where near the excellent Chinese restaurants here in terms of food, service and ambienc

We had our first meal in Singapore here. It is a vast restaurant and we were the first patrons at 6pm so it was very empty. If you're used to Chinese restaurants in the UK, you may well find this place a little off-putting, the menu is not in any way similar. I struggled to find anything to eat that I recognised/wanted. They had the usual birds' nest soup and shark's fin soup which I'd never eat but the rest was, well, tricky to negotiate. We eventually managed to order a meal but were surprised that starters and mains turn up more or less together. That said the food couldn't be faulted, freshly cooked, tasty and we enjoyed it. There really isn't much ambience though, I think this is a place for large parties, corporate events etc. The waitresses are all nice enough but seemed quite disinterested.
4
Recommended to this place for their yummy dim sum, indeed the dim sum are good and delicate. The Char Siew Puff, Yam Puff, Egg Tart, Custard Bun are very delicious. Advisable to make reservation to avoid disappointment, please take note there is a dress code for Royal China though the day we went was rather casual and they didn't seem to enforce the dress code. The staff could be way better to be more service oriented and polite. Despite there were very few tables occupied, the staff just took our menu and pass to the other table... not sure if only cater 1 menu per 10 tables
3
Came here for a group lunch and ordered a selection of dim sum and some Peking Duck. The dim sum was quite decent but the duck was far too fatty. If you're at all particular about your duck then I'd probably recommend not to order it here.
4
My favorite dimsum restaurant :3 and love the minty decoration.
My favorite will always be the porridge, chiangfen, and hakao, the chasiu bun too :3
The price is super affordale too, every visit is enjoyable one :)

I ate here whilst staying at Raffles. This restaurant is not an official Raffles restaurant and if staying at Raffles there are better Raffles restaurants on the complex.I felt the food was very expensive and quality didn't live up to the price. Staff were not particularly approachable or helpful and service was unacceptably slow and unhelpful, especially considering they charge for a service charge. Below is further detail.There were only 2 other groups of diners there when I was there in November, which meant no real atmosphere.If you don't eat fish/seafood, there is a more limited choice. One of the dishes I wanted to order came garnished with fish. I asked if I could have the order without the fish on it, but this was not possible. I ended up just ordering a meat dish with rice. The portion of rice was tiny. I asked for more rice for which I was charged for the extra portion (GBP9 per portion) and had to wait 15-20 minutes for it, so my meat dish to accompany it was cold by the time it arrived. Quality of the meat in the dish was not great, especially considering the price.Wouldn't recommend this place. If you want to eat on the Raffles complex, recommend steakhouse instead
3
I'm not one that expect to be served hand and foot, but at least get the basics right.Orders were missed, no smile, hard to attract attention for simple requests like topping up hot water for the tea and asking for pepper.Food was tasty and above average, but majority of the dishes were lukewarm.I will still return, and will recommend this place to friends. But something has to be done with the service staff. Though not directly under Raffles Hotel, but people will associate nevertheless
3
Afternoon dimsum in Royal China was sadly marred by service staff who were brusque in manner unbefitting for a classy, historical hotel. It was effortful trying to get the atttention of the waitresses. When I finally managed to get the attention of one, she shouted out from across the room, "What do you want?!'" ( in Mandarin). I was too stunned to reply. We also waited 20 minutes for our order of dessert, only to be informed that the particular dessert we ordered was out. The waitress claimed that the kitchen staff had not informed them earlier. To make matters worse, when we asked for the bill, another service staff gave us a bill that included the dessert that never came and we had to spend unnecessary time and energy clarifying the wrong billing. The management seriously needs to look into the communication system amongst its staff and to train its staff in proper service ettiquette. Notwithstanding, I would give the restaurant an average rating only becuase the quality of the dim sum does live up to expectation.

We returned to this restaurant for a same birthday function for the good food and service we experienced 2 years ago. This time it was to our disappointment. We regretted coming back although we had a better alternative that nite. 1. Attentiveness by the staff was lacklustre, most basics had to be requested. While waiting for all in our group to arrive, someone asked for some peanuts etc to munch but was told that we had to pay for it. (It would not have been an issue had the nuts been included in the table set-up and eventually ended in the bill).2. We were surprised that the set menu had 02 beancurd dishes served one after another.......with vegetables making the difference.3. The noodles were served on a plate (iso a bowl) at our table!4. The waiting staff seemed to be more interested in serving another party in a private room. They even sliced up their birthday cake but not for our group of 02 tables.Will never return for Dinner
3
It must have been either a bad day for this apparently reputable Chinese restaurant or the consensus at our table was the standard had dropped....very low! First, despite that we had a reservation we were told to wait....but told to wait in a school teacher tone of voice and manner.....without an apology. Next we had to ask for the menu. Then the food order came wrongly, missing a dish or given the same dish three times even when we informed the staff we already had the dish. Food came lukewarm. Service was poor....we would have got better service at a local market! As a visitor to Singapore I m observing that the standard of service in Chinese restaurants has dropped over the years ....this is even worse given Royal China's lovely decor and being located in a premier and famous hotel. Sigh....disappointing
4
Reservation is allowed though there are 2 sittings made available. (Weekend lunch)We went for the 1.30pm seating. A comfortable slightly later (dim-sum) lunch time for an easy Sunday afternoon. One day prior to reservation, a confirmation call was extended. 45mins before reservation, another reminder call was made by the service staff. Dim Sum selection were adequate for various preferences. And food served were fresh. Suitable for families, couple and gatherings. In fact, a gorgeous place for entertaining as well
4
We enjoyed our Saturday evening dinner at Royal China at Raffles. This is located in the shopping arcade surrounding the Raffles Hotel but not technically "in" the hotel. However, they are capitalizing on the location and your wallet definitely pays a price! We enjoyed very good food including prawn toast with caviar, Peking duck, a BBQ platter, house special fried rice. We were delighted with the food but thought overall the price was noticeably higher than other establishments offering similar quality food. Again, they may not have the location this does but still most of us have a budget! Likely to return for a special occasion but probably not as a frequent dining option

Having been a regular patron at the London Baker St. Original I thought I would take the family out for their Fav Aromatic Crispy Duck as you mostly get the Peking duck in Singapore instead ….. Went there and ordered the chicken corn soup and hot and sour soup to start with …. the chicken corn soup was pretty bland and the hot and sour seafood one was way over spiced ….. The crispy aromatic duck was average but not even close to the quality one gets in the original London Branch ….. The sliced beef with mushroom and the roast chicken with garlic were average at best …… the fried calamari with chili and salt was good …. the soft shell crab below average ……. the only thing which was as good as the original was the variation on the fukien fried rice called the hokkien fried rice at this branch …… all in all a very average experience at best and the price was also much higher than London :

We stayed at Raffles before joining a cruise and as you would expect were spoilt rotten in a great hotel.Our only criticism of Raffles is that it could have such a sub-standard, unpleasant restaurant on it's premises. Clearly and for Raffles benefit, it is not a hotel restaurant, just a tenant.The service was attrocious from start to finish. No, we are used to Hong Kong, so it's not the efficient business like service there, this was plain rude and unpleasant. Grunts and more grunts, and very expensive grunts. The food was okay, but a cheaper alternative of the same quality is Din Tau Fung in Raffles City. Friendly, food's as good if not better, and substantially cheaper, just as noisy.This is a bad, bad restaurant overcharging for what it does badly and holding itself out as a part of Raffles Hotel. Avoid, there are a lot of much better alternatives that won't rip you off like this ...... and you guessed it, for the first time in Singapore we both got I crook from it

16 of us thoroughly enjoyed the lunch .Very good tim sum and the service staffs attentive and polite .Roast duck is outstanding .Price a little high maybe dued to the premium location.

One of the better place to have Dim Sum in town. Even though its located in a very prestigious hotel, Raffles Hotel, the prices are actually very reasonable.

Today is the second time I am back at Royal China @ Raffles, and it is yet another family event. I figure that if I want to return to this lovely restaurant for good dimsum, I need to have a larger group so we can order more items to shareRoyal China @ Raffles offers a very comfortable and tranquil setting, soothing, even. Its light cyan / aqua colored walls are often likened to the "Tiffany & Co's Blue Box" hues, and this is a tone of luxury and calmness. The clean-cut furnishings makes the place elegant but non-pretentiousWe started with Char Siew Paus (buns with red, sweet pork meat) - soft and fluffy bun with tender pork cubes within, marinated in a sweet sauce. This is rather tasty, but I still prefer the traditional Hong Kong's Char Siew Pau that comes with the dark-colored minced pork.The next item we ordered was the Peking Duck with Caviar - they served the skin wrapped in thin sheets of crepe / popiah skins, alongside with a small plate of Caviar, spring onions and a sweet dark sauce on the side. The skin was tasty and crispy, of course, and paired with the somewhat grainy texture and sweet hints of the crepe skins, and crackling caviar, the sensation was amazing.Next, the Char Siew Shu (pastry with red sweet pork meat within) - the crusts was a fluffy shell of slightly-crunchy flour, made all the more fragrant by sesame seeds atop. The red meat bits within (char siew) was delicious and tasty, and there was not a hint of fatty meat - somethhing that we appreciated greatly.Following this, we had the Scallops Dumplings - a delicious creation of thin, sticky dumpling skin encompassing scallops and shrimps within. The seafood items were fresh and added a touch of flouncy-ness to the dumpling. The leek within (leek or spring onion or some other strong-flavored vegetable within) also gave this dumpling a distinctive flavor.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/03/lunch-at-royal-china-raffles.htm

Verdict - service needs to match the excellent decor.Ordered Dim Sum. After asking about the ingredients of various items I proceeded to order items which I believed Not to contain prawns. but some of the dishes did have prawns, which I proceeded to consume.. I had a reaction.Staff need to be better trained or they will be rushing diners to the hospital One day.Food- Dim Sum was not bad but not spectacular either. You are probably better off in Tim Ho Wan for delicious Dim Sum in Singapore.

We are serious dim sum for lunch fans, as it doesn't exist in Bordeaux, and it was excellent at the Royal China. Located on 3rd floor at back of Raffles so fun to wander around this lovely old lady.Great selection available for all tastes, and was not expensive for the quality of the dishes.Service was a bit slow in getting started but was very good once underway.Very good pork buns, pork puffs, spare ribs in black bean sauce, HK Kai lan and other vegetables, all forms of dumplings , fried carrot cake and custard tarts ... A true dim sum lunch feast ... We loved it and would readily go again

Service is def. average. I can't help to say it is like hotel style service... Mum visiting in town who really wanna check out Raffles hotel, I called in advance to book a table for lunch, I was told that it was full house. At the end, we still made it to visit and walk around the Raffles Hotel, we passed by here to see if we had some luck, and turned out, we could have a table! When we walked in, it was pretty empty... why was it full? And if the Royal China doesn't know how to do marketing, it def. gonna lose lots of business and customers...We had ordered few plates of dim sum, they tasted good and fresh. It costed us like SGD 55+ for three persons. I was quite surprised that for such hotel style restaurant, it charges like normal restaurants in mall or something. Compare to other restaurants in Raffles, it is quite a good deal!Inspite the good dim sum and reasonable price of Royal China, according to its poor service, it is hard to commit the next visit hereCheers

Raffles Hotel would do well to make it very clear that this restaurant is in no way connected to the hotel. The standards of service are on different planets. I had read a few negative reviews posted on the service but decided to give it a go - it's Raffles - how bad can it be ? Indifferent and disinterested serving staff who were clearing away our plates before a meal was finished. 10pm on a Saturday night, screaming toddlers allowed to run all around the restaurant to different tables while the staff were completely oblivious to the kindergarten din. The dress code is supposedly smart casual - shirts with collar and no shorts, yet of the very few people in the restaurant, several were in soccer shorts and t shirts or track suit pants - dress code is a joke.The food ? - ok but overpriced and most of it obviously cooked way in advance of any order. No wonder the place was not even 10% full on a Saturday night

I was here on the recommendation of a friend to have my lunch as it was my birthday. Food was fresh and good, however the service by one of their managers was horrendously rude. I folded the menu gently on the other way so that I could show my boyfriend what I wanted to eat, the manager came over and snatched the menu off my hands and said very rudely "Can you pls don't fold the menu?" I was taken aback by his attitude. How can he snatch the menu just like that? It was supposed to be a happy day to dine, however this attitude marred the whole experience. From the moment that we stepped in, everyone was rude and grumpy. Most probably will not come back again. There are better food places with much better service

A dinner to meet up with old friends was a treat. But the dinner was not.Reception was good.The clear herbal chicken soup was delicious. Soup was luxuriously fragrant & palatable. Double-boiled chicken meat was tender. Serves 4, SGD 68.Half Peking Duck was well done. Hot pepper stir-fried duck was tender & tasty. SGD 33.Sautéed asparagus with ginko nuts & mushroom was ordinary & lackluster.Was looking forward to Lobster noodle. Disappointed. very small portions of over-fried & battered lobster pieces. Noodles too oily. Expected more.Dessert was standard fare go herbal jelly, glutinous race balls, Japanese melon purée.Dinner was a whopping SGD 290 after a super 10% OCBC World Card discount.Won't miss this place for a while, unless it is offering 50% discount at the next Great Singapore Sale

To be honest, I had high expectations for the Raffles Hotel, Singapore and even higher expectations for dim sum at the Royal China. If this restaurant has any connection to its namesake in London, it must be a mistake. While the Royal China in London has beautiful tasteful decor, the one in Singapore looks tired and dull. My colleagues were kind enough to drive me out one workday to experience the Royal China at the Raffles Hotel. First, we had to climb three flights of stairs and go through hallways resembling mazes to find the restaurant. When we got to the restaurant, I found the furnishings to be too minimalistic, dated and dull.Still, there was a good crowd for a weekday. We settled in a corner and placed our order. Service left a lot to be desired, the food was average, and when we called for dessert, they served the cold desserts quick enough but the hot desserts came much later. We would have liked some consistency- that is to serve everyone at the same time so that no one feels left out or feels a need to rush so that the others don't wait.A meal for 4 came up to sgd 170 with dessert and taxes. It was grossly overpriced for substandard service. If you enjoy food I'd say this isn't worth the time. But if you like ambience and want to pretend you're still living in the 1800's you're welcome to visit

Royal China at Raffles Hotel is worth the visit for a little more upmarket Dim Sum experience, although it is not too expensive. Fantastic Peking Duck and Dim Sum, service attentive and professional!!

My favorite hotel in Singapore is raffles.We have expereinced all the restaurants in the hotel and all have lived up to the Raffles experience.The food is just ok nothing special for the price they charge.The service. Is beyond impersonal and unfriendly.We were 6 people 2 were served there dinner first after 20 minutes one of our party got up to find a waitress to find out where our dinners were.Then they messed up our orders it was an all around bad experience .What restaurant brings your desert while your still eating your dinner.We ask them to remove it till we were finiished with dinner . No one ever asked us if we wanted tea or coffee and we had to ask them to bring our desert. There is no excuse for such poor service they were not busy only two other tables were being served.This restaurant does not belong in the Raffles hote

Went on a weekday. Reservation is still advisable, as people tend to go there for business lunch. Possible to book even on the morning itself. Classy ambience but could still manage to go in casual attire (as long as you are not wearing your pyjamas) like tee-shirt and skirt with my birkies. Recommended dishes:- Peking duck (top fave, comes with caviar)- Char siew sor (very soft pastry!)- Chee Cheong Fun- Har gau (taste fresh)- Century egg congee (really good!)- Fried beancurd roll (very tasty)3 of us. Ordered peking duck, 1 congee and maybe 7-9 dim sum. Overly stuffed. Spent average $35 per person
3
We booked a table here as we wanted the raffles experience on our first visit to singapore.It did not live up to our expectations Firstly you have to find the restaurant not easy.We were then shown to a table for 6 only two of us very impersonal. the menu was not easy to understand and the staff were less than helpful.The carpet beside our table was filthy also the curtains were covered with stains not what you would expect at raffles.The staff brought my husbands main course put it on the table as we were eating our starters when the rice arrived it was warm not hot and we had almost finished our main course.No one asked if we had enjoyed our meal not a restaurant i would recommend to visit in singapore there are far nicer with much better service

I had a business lunch at the Royal China in Raffles this past week. The place was a bit difficult to find since the address reflects the Raffles Hotel but the restaurant is located in the 3rd for the Raffle Mall. I finally found the elevator and waited for it to come down. Maybe because of its age, the elevator was quite slow coming down and going up. It is part of the Raffles ambience, i guess.I finally found the restaurant. The white table cloth gave it a refined ambience that is not typical of dimsum restaurants. The dimum dishes were quite refined and tasty. We chose 4 dishes to share and we were not disappointed
4
The restaurant serves reasonably good food but need to improve on their services which I really cannot blame the management due to the labour crunch in Singapore. The dim sum is good but the other popular dishes such as the crispy duck n braised lobster noodle are not as good as the one served at their London Bayswater's restaurant. Try their weekend 8-course set menu for ten persons - very good associated dishes at about S$40 per person. Avoid ordering Coke - they sell at a exorbitant price of S$8 per can
3
A visit to Royal China restaurant is expected when you visit Raffles. The food is very good but I was most surprised at the poor quality of service - slopping of tea into cups and lots going on the table cloth - indifferent and somewhat unfriendl

Being a regular and a fan of their dim sum at their London Bayswater's branch, I decided to give their Singapore branch a go, especially reading all the rave reviews below. But I have to say, not only it does not hold a candle to the original but we came away highly disappointed.First of all, the service is weird, they don't deliver the dishes straight to your table but let them sit on a station NEXT to the table, and some other staff take their time to deliver them after to your table. so you can imagine our frustrations seeing our dishes going cold in front of us! So not Cantonese. and weirdly a restaurant with this sort of pricing and in Raffles hotel itself, the staff don't seem to be on the same level, they simply lack training and finesse.Now the food, and where do I start? - the cheong fun sauce is way too salty to the point of overpowering, the cha siew buns, which is one of my favourite dishes at the bayswater branch, is rather flavourless, lacking in the honey sauce (蜜汁) and way too doughy. the congees are pretty blend, the century eggs are not the famed sugar heart type (糖心皮蛋) which you would expect from a restaurant at this level and the congee itself tasteless (even the crystal jade at basement Takashimaya makes a better one), the fish in the fish congee is not even fresh. The har gau is passable albeit the skin is bit too thick, the chicken feet however are sickly sweet (a stark contrast to the one in Bayswater). We ordered a portion of roast goose and it was dry, chewy and tasteless (how does one manage to make a bird normally so oily parched?), at this level of dinning we also expected it to be deboned, but it wasn't. However, the accolade of worst dishes had to be given to the crispy skin pork belly and the duck tongues, the former was overly salty and overcooked, the top supposedly crispy skin was actually burnt and you can taste it, not at all palatable, I think I've had better ones at a normal hawker store. and the latter was dry, chewy and tasteless, like eating my shoe sole, they should be tender and succulent. Needless to say, we didn't finish these 2 dishes. Of the whole meal, I think only the yam cake with scallop was palatable, but being a true blue Cantonese, the steamed and cleaner dishes are the ones that separate the sheep from the goats, because there is nowhere to hide.I thought if they would at least maintain the London's level if not trying to surpass it, after all this is a Chinese society compare to London, but boy was I disappointed. I would give this a wide berth and go for some real Cantonese fare such as Imperial Treasure at Great World City or Man Fu Yuan at Intercontinental to name just a couple

Probably the 2nd best restaurant in the Raffles hotel - we went midweek on the recommendation of a friend.Enormous menu but shamefully, we stuck to pretty anglicised 'chinese' food. No matter, it was still excellent, the crispy duck was prepared in front of us as it should be, and the thin sizzling beef steak was wonderful. Service competent and friendly (the waitress even advised us we'd ordered too much and should probably stop).Only one downside and that is that dim sum is not available in the evening
4
I went there for Dim Sum lunch. The place was busy but not 100% full. Waiters gave us menues after 10 minutes and took an order after 30. And made 3 mistakes. And they didn't care about us, I served vine by myself. Sometimes I should order twice cause my previous orders didn't reach kitchen. And Dim Sums should be served HOT. London version is much better, no complains
5
Great food and service, decor and interior could need some improvement, you really feel you are in China with lighting at this level. Happy to adapt many to your taste and requirements.Well worth a visit in a town of many Chinese restaurants.
5
real exquisite chinese food at its best. enough said about the food, the environment is super gorgeous !
3
Decent lobster noodles but the rest of the dim sum is just average. I brought my parents in law there and they though Wah Lok is much better.

I went on a Monday with two friends for their Dim Sum lunch. You would expect them to be more attentive as the place is half-empty, but they were just lounging around avoiding eye contact with the patrons. We had to place our orders at least 3 times before it reached the kitchen. The food were lukewarm (though it tasted good) which was disappointing because Dim Sum is supposed to be served fast and piping hot. Prices were reasonable for the Dim Sum but they should work on their service levels

Saw mixed reviews for this place but decided to try it. Booked Sunday brunch 3 weeks in advance. Got there at 11am, sat down, but took them a while to get us a menu (they didn't notice we didn't have one until we called their attention). Happily, it went uphill from there.There's no ambience to speak of, but the food more than made up for it. We went with dim sum and didn't bother to try the other dishes. The baked roast pork bun (house specialty) was to die for. The bun was so soft as it literally came out of the oven, and we had to send back for seconds. The fried carrot cake was good as well, and the spare ribs and shrimp dumplings were very tasty. All in all, we stuffed our faces (we actually left a few pieces) with a high quality dim sum lunch for less than SGD 50.It's a steal for Royal Dimsum

Dimsum fans would have heard of Royal China and their perpetual full-house seatings that require phone bookings in advance. I called them on a Thursday to make booking for Sunday's brunch but it was all fully booked. So if you're planning to go on a weekend, do call about a week in advance to make reservations.While I was on my craze to find the best 流沙包 (flowy custard egg yolk bun), Royal China was my last dimsum place I've visited three days in a row. Despite how I've had the same dishes for three days by different dimsum chefs, Royal China still managed to serve up fine dishes to whet my appetite.We'd expected a larger seating area but it was just a cosy space that could take about 100 persons or so. It had very vibrant ambience, good for family gatherings over the weekends. Service staff were dressed up just like those in Chinese restaurants and they were all very friendly. However, given the high traffic, don't expect them to respond to you very promptly and as there were large pillars lining the centre of the restaurant, we also found it rather hard to get the attention of the service staff. Chee Cheong Fun ($4.80)A combination platter of prawn, scallop and char siew. The skin was a very unique one, with rough edges on one side, perhaps made such that the different layers do not stick together. It was very soft and didn't stick to the teeth at all. I liked the sauce too, a typical one used in most dimsum places, made with soy sauce as a base. It wasn't too salty and added a light flavour to the dish. Of all the different ingredients, I enjoyed the scallop one best. You could taste the freshness of the scallop bursting with every bite, soft and tender. Generous with their servings of seafood, there were more than enough scallops to go around and each was a big one at that. The prawn and char siew ones were ordinary though. Verdict: 8.0/10Fried Prawn Dumpling ($4.80)One of the best fried dumplings I've had, the skin wrapping the prawn before drying was so thin that it only added a crisp instead of the usual kind where you can taste the wrap. The prawns were so fresh that you could taste the natural sweetness of it. A simple dish done well! Verdict: 9.0/10Carrot Cake ($4.00)With finely grated white carrot strips, this has been pan-fried to a thin crispy layer on the outside and extremely tender on the inside. As it was made with carrot strips, it didn't have the 'kueh' texture that tends to stick to your teeth. Verdict: 7.5/10Har Gao ($4.80)A dish that's always on my must-order list every time I go to a dimsum place, this is my test to how good the restaurant is. A staple in all traditional dimsum place, this is a seemingly easy dish but few can do it well. The prawns, just like those used in the fried prawn dumpling, were fresh and tender, and wasn't overly crunchy. The skin was a little too sticky for my liking and didn't manage to gel well with the insides as it was on the verge of falling out. I find the flavour a little over-mixed with other condiments that you can't solely taste the flavour of the prawns. I might be overly critical though, with my unusually high standards of har gao. Verdict: 7.0/10Mango Custard Egg Yolk Bun ($4.00)A rather disappointing dish for a 流沙包 fan. The bun was a bit too thick, though I liked how it was fluffy enough that you don't tire of it easily. The key ingredients of custard and egg yolk weren't well-blended though, with a little too much custard. It didn't manage to bring out the savory part of the dish and of course, not flowing out is a deadly sin. Also, it didn't have a tinge of mango in it at all. It was quite a pity though, as it could have added a refreshing touch to the dish, setting it apart from other 流沙包. Verdict: 6.0/10Siew Mai ($4.80)It tastes as good as it seems! Tender, juicy and succulent meat with a generous serving of prawns. The wanton skin wrapping it was also just right, not too sticky yet manages to hold the piece together. The wolfberry on top added a unique twist to it, with added herbal sweetness to complete the flavour.Verdict: 8.0/10Lotus Rice ($18.00)More than sufficient for 3 persons, this was one that impressed my mum. Simmered in the heat of the lotus leaves, each grain of rice were infused with its fragrance that got me addicted even for someone who doesn't eat rice items for a dimsum meal. Each piece of meat was tender and juicy, with added flavour from the mushrooms. A finely done dish! Verdict: 8.5/10Mango Pudding ($5.00)This would be one dessert that will get me going back. You might probably think it's just another mango pudding, but don't belittle this small piece of pudding. With real mango bits blended in, it isn't the coagulated hard pudding you get off the shelf in supermarkets or any other Chinese dessert store. Finely blended and mixed with a tad of milk, it was rich and yet not too sweet. Every mouthful got us wanting for more! Verdict: 9.0/10Mango Sago with Pomelo ($6.00)This was very disappointing. I find it a little diluted and it simply paled in comparison to the heavenly mango pudding that came before this. An overpriced glass of mango sago, you can get a decent 杨枝甘露 anywhere along Liang Seah Street's dessert stores. Verdict: 6.0/10Decent dimsum at affordable prices given its location and ambience. I'd expected the bill to come up to alot more in fact. Not all were spectacular, I've got to give them credits for some of the fine details they paid attention to the dishes though.

I try to have dinner at Royal China at least once a month. I like the sharks fin soup cooked with kampong chicken (a pot is good for 4 dinners). Due to the long hours required for the preparation of this soup, you will need to give the restaurant at least a day to prepare the soup. But it is worth it. The restaurant also offers a variety of rather exquisite soup and the experienced waitresses will request that you do not add any vinegar or pepper lest you ruin the taste that the chefs have taken pains to create.My son always ask for its trademark aromatic duck. Just remember to ask them to wrap the duck roll for you and to add more sauce. I find it too dry otherwise. And, a word of advice, it is best not to wrap duck up on your own. It may be fun wrapping up the duck roll but this is no 'popiah' and we cannot roll it like them - the right amount of cucumber, spring onion, shredded duck and sauce (the more the merrier). Recently, it seems there has been a change in the chef(s) (the food somehow does not taste quite as good) and most of the waitresses are new. They even have waiters now (it used to be served only by waitresses in the past).The pipa duck is superb but requires a day's advance order. I like the crispy skin that oozes a particularly fragrant aroma when you dig into it. Yummy!I also loved the fish served here especially the steamed fish fillet served with chopped garlic. A piece is never quite enough but one has to keep some space for dessert.The desserts served here are to die for. They are always the highlights of my dinners at this restaurant.I like the coconut jelly dessert that comes in a coconut shell topped with a scoop of ice-cream (advance booking required) I also love the apple jelly that comes with tropical fruits. The portion is extremely small though ($8 per serving that comes in a small glass). I guess it is the bits of nuts and preserved fruits that lend this dessert that very special taste.For dinners who prefer warm desserts, go for the duck yoke layered cake. It is served steaming hot and the yoke taste like kaya (a local coconut paste). Really delicious.Last but not least, if you have the inclination, do order their suckling piglet. You probably wouldn't like it anywhere else after you have tasted theirs.What separates Royal China from the other Chinese restaurants in Singapore is the creativity of the chefs. They make subtle changes to traditional dishes thereby creating master pieces to be shared with fortunate diners who are lucky enough to discover this little gem of a restaurant on the 4th level of the old Raffles Hotel.Advice: Go for the dinner - more relaxed. And be prepared to spend a little more

They served yum cha by menu; not trolley service. Most of the items on the menu were recognizable to us so it was easy to decide what we wanted to order. The waiter also suggested we try their tea smoked chicken so we agreed. The jasmine tea we ordered was very nice; served weak without us having to ask. The dishes were delivered a couple at a time and were generally similar to those we get in Brisbane. I did find the pork spareribs a little bonier than I am used to. We got three pork buns in the basket instead of normal two. The tea smoked chicken was very tender and had a delicate taste. We were pleased with the recommendation so took the waiter advice on desserts as well. The dessert menu was quite extensive and apart from a mango pudding, nothing that we had heard of before. We ordered two desserts to share. The first was a Japanese pumpkin soup served with coconut ice cream and cashews. Sounded unusual but it was cool and sweet and very nice though the cashews were a bit out of place, I thought. The second dessert was a mango soup with sago and pomelo threads. Again very nice. Neither of us could decided which we liked better so we kept switching after every couple of mouthfuls. A very pleasant meal in quite refined circumstances. I am glad we had taken the time to dress up as we would have been out of place in our jeans or shorts

Booked seats for the restaurant in advance to celebrate Mother's Day and the reason for choosing this place was for the good reviews.The service standard of the restaurant was real bad the moment we sat down.No menu was given and no one even bothered to offer tea instead all were busy trying to sit the guests because we have to eat finished by 1215hrs (we entered ard 1100hrs).The staff came to take our orders after we have to get them to give us a menu. And they didn't even bother to ask if we would like to have some tea. Instead we had to request 3 times before the pot of tea came. Even a regular neighbourhood coffee shop can do way better than this renowned restaurant.The food only arrived at 1140hrs which gives us like what, 30 minutes stuff the food down. Not only that, so many of the food orders we gave didn't arrive and they claimed that it was not in the order sheet. And when the bill came, they staff gave us a wrong information about the pricing of the food when he took our order and insisted that all of us heard the wrong thing.Seriously, I will not return back to this place even though some of the items were quite good because the service is horrible for such restaurant

Well, heard a lot of good thing about this restaurant. Called 3 weeks ago to book a table, with the intention to try their dim sum. Got a call from them a day earlier and only till then, I was told that the Dim Sum is limited to only 8 choices during Chinese New Year. Would have been much better if I was informed earlier. That way, I could have planned.Without any other choice, we went there and was impressed by the design, decoration. Indeed it is very very nice. However, the waitress gave us the wrong tea, served the wrong dishes. Not sure how it can happen and I was really disappointed. Dim sum wise - quality is really just normal! Not worth the price

Serve one of the best dim sum in Singapore. Not to be missed: Char Siew Pao, Siew Mai, Har Kaw and Royal Cheong Fun.

I would have expected better service from a restaurant associated with the Raffles brand. The service lived up to true Singaporean service; rather rude and brash. The food was good though and the ineteror was beautifully and delicately coloured in blue tones. We had dimsum and also a Peking duck and both were delicious.

We booked in for New years Eve and had one of the worst Chinese meals we have ever had. There was no crispy duck because they had sold out (8pm!) and the food arrived as it was cooked so that the 4 of us were all served our main course at different times. The rice finally arrived after everyone had finished. They did deduct the cost of the rice from our bill when we complained, but it didn't really compensate for the chaos of our service

We loved all our orders. The food was served fast, and every food that came tasted heavenly, especially the layered cake with salted egg, lava bun, pork barbeque pastry, and royal china rice roll. Inspite of being located at Raffles Hotel, the price was reasonable. At the end of the meal, we made 2 more orders of the lava bun for take away. The meal was awesome, and we will definitely go back there again and again

The quality of the food and restaurant setting here is definitely above your average Chinese restaurant. And for the price you pay, it definitely also offers fantastic value for money.Especially love the dim sum here, would recommend to anyone who's willing to pay a little more for exquisite tim sum

Royal China has one of the best dim sum places in Singapore. Flavours are clean and distinct. The sharks fin soup is boiled to perfection - the order is able to serve up to 4 people! (With at least 2 bowls each!) Lobster noodles has great balance of seasoning, the lobster meat seasoned just right to bring out the freshness of the lobster. Must try

Staying at Raffles hotel we thought any restaurant associated with the brand would deliver a comparable level of customer satisfaction. We were wrong......The restaurant is nicely laid out and the staff attentive but the food was a disgrace.We had minced prawns on toast. They were old, reheated and oilyThe red grouper was raw in the middle with blood still showingThe mixed vegetables had a thick black hair in themThe crispy duck was the only item to barely pass muster. Too dry and reheated but at least edible.I strongly suggest you consider eating elsewhere and avoid being caught out the way we were. Hopefully people will read this review and think twice before spending al lot of money for terrible food

Been to this place a couple of times but had never written any reviews on it. The last time that i visited this place is a few months ago, for the sunday Dim sum with my family. Before that, i had been to this place for dinner.Anyway, my impression of this restaurat is the clean look inside the restaurant. Somehow, it looked similar to Lei Garden at Chijmes to me. But i would say that the food quality is similar too. Great standard and fresh ingredients. The service provided was top-notch too. Guess i have been there too many times and thus, the captains and waitress all know me (hahaha), that may explains the good service that i'd received.The desserts are fantastic too. Anyway, its easy to find parking lots here. Great place to enjoy great cantonese cuisine. Though the price is abit on the high side

We followed the suggestion of our guide and the good reviews and we had one of the best culinary experience of our honeymoon. Ambient could seem cold (the whole place is white and light blue) but it makes it a very particular place. Service was perfect, our waitress helped us to chose the specilties of the house and we opted for the peking duck, which was one of the best we ever had. It is not cheap but it worths every dollar

Restaurant offers excellent Dim Sum as well as quite a good selection of the classic Chinese dishes. Our favourite choices include the Char Siu Puffs, Har Gao, Lobster Noodles and Soft-Shell Crabs. Prices are on the high side, which is to be expected given its location in the Raffles Hotel, impressive decor and classy ambience. Service is attentive and gracious on the whole
