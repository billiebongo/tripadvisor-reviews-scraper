The area was neat and clean, however the service left a lot to be desired. Staff where every slow in serving us and did not fully understand what they had to offer. Seems like we where second on their list of priorities.

Friendly service, knowledgeable about the beers on tap & willing to give recommendations (be it for food or drinks). Food was delicious too. By far my favourite place to have a drink in town.

I’m a huge fan of craft beer, and I always struggle to find a place in Singapore that serves such a good range of craft beers from all over the world.Plus, I would give them 11/10 for service. I accidentally spilled my beer and I was Super willing to pay for a new glass, but they said “Hey, it’s Friday, you probably had a tough week at work. Take a chill pill. We’ll replace it for you!”They were angels, and I’m going back every week after Easter! (I’m kind of fasting from beer for Lent :P

Had dinner here but came more for the craft beers. 3 of us shared what the servers recommended: Craft beer chicken rice, Green curry Lychee duck Linguine, and a bloody mary pork chop (a Halloween Special). There was a minor mix-up with the orders at the kitchen and it took a while for the dishes to be served, but that was quickly sorted out. Great attempt was made to salvage it as we were offered a second craft beer on the house. Shortly after the food arrived. The chicken rice was disappointing with the rice in chunks and rather tasteless, the chicken slightly under cooked. The linguine was spicy but enjoyable while the Halloween special pork chop was tender and juicy, just that the cranberry sauce was a little sour. Nitro beers were smooth and creamy and refreshing, but a pity the Brewlander beers were not available on the day. Will consider this place for a chill out session over a few beers in future

When you see that their beer menu is longer than their food menu, you definitely know what the focus is on. (That doesn't mean the food isn't good though, the Green Curry Lychee pasta certainly packed a punch, and the fluffy Beef Fat Potatoes definitely helped with taming some of that heat) That said, the beer was still the highlight of the meal. Staff were knowledgeable and friendly, confidently recommending their favourites and taking note of their customers preferences

Five Marbles, a new restaurant set up with the idea of building a community of people who love great food and great beers. At any day, there are 12 craft beers on tap sourced from this little red dot, Japan, Australia, USA, UK and New Zealand. The craft beer list will be refresh from time to time, to allow the customer to savour the exciting offerings.Following the theme of the restaurant, the food here is also infused with their craft beers. Don't worry, you won't get drunk from the food, but you can definitely get high from the beers. We started with Craft Beer Mushroom Soup ($9). Made with four type of mushrooms: shiitake, portobello, white button and oyster. The brownish dark colour soup is robust, creamy and filled with complex mushrooms flavour. Watch out for the hint of beer flavour at the end of each slurp of the soup. Portobello Chicken Cheese Baked Beer Rice ($16). A flavourful mushroom and chicken rice, topped with cheddar cheese. It is then oven-baked, to melt the cheese and create a crisp texture of the cheese. The rice is al-dente, and you can taste the chicken and mushroom in each bite. A solid baked rice dish.Bolognese Linguine ($16). A signature dish where the Chef will proudly called bolognese sauce as Ragu (a type of meat sauce that have simmered for hours under the TLC of the Chef). Craft beer is used here to replace the red wine in the sauce. The flavours of the bolognaise definitely stands out in each strand of the pasta. Green Curry Lychee Duck Linguine ($19). A special recipe by the Chef, where lychee is added to give the sweetness in the curry. Advanced warning, this green curry is very spicy. You will definitely need one of the beers to cool down the flame. I feel the green curry infused nicely with the pasta. However, the smoked duck is more like a supporting cast dish instead of the leading protein in this dish. Craft Beer Chicken Rice ($16). Inspired by Beer Chicken recipe, the chicken is marinated with Cajun spices, beer then grilled. The meat is tender and succulent, to go with the homemade chicken rice. Not sure why they also include baked potatoes in this dish. Although it is delicious, it seems like too much carbo overload for me. Personally think that the Craft Beer Chicken should be served with either the rice or potatoes, not both. Salted Egg Fish Crisps ($9). One of the bar bites. Deep fried fish skin with salted egg. Crispy, Saltish and Addictive. Enough Said!!Beer Grilled Honey Wings ($9 for half dozen). It has the same flavour as the Craft Beer Chicken. It is tender and succulent, with a solid cajun seasoning. LD wish that the skin is more crisp, to give this dish a contrasting texture. I will not go through the 12 Craft beers on the list since I can't drink alcohol due to medical reason. However, for the most updated Craft beers on the tap, check out Five Marbles Facebook Page. The Craft Beers come in Half Pint (priced between $5 to $7) and Full Pint (priced between $10 to $14). The signature desserts in Five Marbles are definitely R-rated. They are called Beer Float, combining the artisan ice cream with Craft Beers. It also come with some catchy name such as: The White Princess ($17, Coconut Ice Cream + Gosnells Citra Sea Mead); Darker Than Black ($15, Dark Chocolate Ice Cream + Chocolate Stout); Crumble & Tumble ($15, Coconut Ice Cream + Apple Crumble Cider); and Calamity Affogato ($15, Vanilla Ice Cream + Coffee Ale). LD's favourite is Crumble & Tumble as it tasted like Apple Crumble pie in beer version. Located in the courtyard of Rendezvous Hotel Singapore, the setting is just gorgeous. The tall glass ceiling allows the natural lights to penetrate through, and the white colour tiles just brighten the place more. A good place to chill out and relax with friends and family.Overall, I applaud beer-infused dishes created in Five Marbles. It is like a bridge that links the food and beer pairing. Although I did not try the beers, LD enjoy their sweet and light version of their craft beer, especially their Beer Float. A good place to chill out and to savour the beer inspired food and craft beers. Cheers!

It's a place for fusion beer as quoted by my regular beer drinker friends, that the beer are too fusion for their taste. As for the food, the menu are limited & taste so so. But aside of that the ambient & service are quite good

Opening its doors in May 2017, Five Marbles Craft Beer Restaurant is in an accessible location, within Rendezvous Hotel, and they offer a good range of craft beers on tap, along with Modern Singaporean dishes that are made with said craft beer!Ambience at Five Marbles Craft Beer Restaurant benefits from the large, open courtyard of Rendezvous Hotel. Ample natural daylight shines through the sheltered, patterned ceiling, while at night, warm and low mood lighting set an intimate tone. Wide, comfortable, sturdy cushioned chairs and spacious tables, make for great relaxing. The place is kept cool with large fans, and there is some greenery around to offset the white, grey, and stone colours. Love the ambience here, it's easy to have hours just pass by, chatting and drinking with friends.Service at Five Marbles Craft Beer Restaurant is efficient and personalised. There are only a few staff, but they're well trained and professional. Guests are quickly attended to upon being seated. While the menu is detailed, staff are able to describe dishes in detail, displaying good product knowledge. They quickly clear away empty / dirty tables when diners leave. I also note that some of them really make the effort to engage diners, and I recommend asking them for advice on craft beer and food pairings. Pretty good service overall.Food at Five Marbles Craft Beer Restaurant is Modern Singaporean cuisine, but don't expect pretentious plates here. Their food is hearty and filling, bold in flavour, rustic in presentation, and absolutely delicious. Nearly every dish here incorporates craft beer in its preparation. Portions are medium to large, more than sufficient for an individual, and best shared. However, Five Marbles Craft Beer Restaurant is best known for their craft beer. Offering a range of 12 craft beers, including several local Singaporean brands, they've designed their offerings such that an individual can drink a variety of half pints. Prices are kept affordable, budget about SGD $40 per person for a full meal with several rounds of half pints here

Located on the ground floor of Rendezvous Hotel, this new casual pub and restaurant offers over a dozen craft beers on tap, ranging from American IPAs to locally brewed ales. They also serve up a clever menu of food that go well with the brews. The young, friendly and attentive staff made sure we were comfortable and kept the drinks coming at just the right pace. The beers are priced at $5-$7 for half pints and $10-$14 for full pints. The tables are spread well apart so can enjoy relaxed conversations or soak in the piped in music as the hours drift by. Definitely a "must try" for any craft beer fan in Singapore
