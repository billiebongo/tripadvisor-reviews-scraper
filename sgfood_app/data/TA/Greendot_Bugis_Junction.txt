The place serves oriental only veg food... if you have a taste for oriental food and are a veg then this is a great place to be... else this should be avoided... the food that we ordered was great.. the service good..

Greendot has truly nailed it. Fresh ingredients, great flavors, clean & bright decor, warm staff who recall regular guest favorite. Fantastic soups and all their mushroom creations are superb. This is veggie food heaven and gracias to greendot for bringing this amazing experience to a much starved veggie fraternity in Singapore. And at these prices - they simply offer one of the best value for money, healthy meals in this super expensive $$$$$$ city Yes - they are for real; they exist; and hope they change nothing

This is by far the best cheap vegetarian place we have visited in Singapore. They use lions mane mushroom a lot so if you like that, strongly recommended! Easygoing and casual place with local clientele. Self-service. Beautiful and clean eating space, does not feel like fast food place even though bento boxes work in a fast food way - the sauces are pre-made
