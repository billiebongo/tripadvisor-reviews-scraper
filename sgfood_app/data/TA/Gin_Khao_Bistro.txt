We usually visit this outlet if we we want to get away from the crowds in the city. The food is average and service rather slow, however ambience is pleasant.

Outdoor seating is good also when you have larger group of people, the dishes that are combination dishes that you find in the back of the menu with pictures, are good and fullfilling, the spice beef in particular. They also have ok Lime Juice and always a deal on the Beers if you are thirsty.. Good regular place also for take out

We were at the W Singapore for the weekend and took a stroll to Quayside Isle for a late lunch. I had read good reviews of this place, hence was curious. We had the stir fried beef slices - which were chewy and hard to eat. The grilled mackerel was decent but nothing you couldn't get in a decent jap restaurant. The mussels in beer broth was such a rip off (10 for $15.80) - and unappetizing (the broth looked insipid and was unfragrant) that we sent it back.Bottom line - don't bother

We visited Gin Khao at Quayside Isle for the first time on 19th Oct. There wasnâ€™t a crowd and we were served promptly by Kanweljeet (we asked for his name before we left). He was the only server the entire night. We wanted to redeem Chope restaurant but he was unsure about it. He asked if we could use it another day, but we were only there for a day. Thereafter he took the initiative to video call his superior to check on how to redeem it for us. Even though he was alone on the frontline, he kept a smile on his face and did get service throughout. He continued with the video call in between serving different customers. Additionally, food was great. Our night was made. Will definitely return

Lovely setting right by Sentosa Cove. The Tom Yum Gai soup was spicy and full of chicken. It was a big bowl and excellent value for money. The grilled mackeral was delicious too. All in all a pleasant meal from friendly staff

Recommended eating place for casual & no frill dining. Great food with a nice view and attentive service by restaurant staff.

Under staffed, long wait, so so food... We expected more of an establishment situated in Sentosa Cove.

Gin Khao offers excellent value for money and nice ambience. 2 thumbs up for their seafood Tom Yum Soup

They were extremely short handed and the service was terrible. One of the female staff has bad attitude (although not serving us). And we witness many others who streamed in with the same problem as us. The food wasn't fantastic either. It was really disappointing as we were there to celebrate our friend's birthday.

I'll start with a positive, this is a good looking restaurant with curb appeal.The negatives:* Ordering: We waited a very long time for our drinks order to be taken, followed by another long wait to place our food order. Bad start when you have two hungry toddlers edging closer to bed time. * Food waiting time: We then waited an hour for our food to arrive but only my husband's meal materialised (no apology or explanation). He finished eating and my children and I were still waiting for our food. My food then arrived but they had forgotten my children's food. My husband had to take them home as they were hungry and upset. I waited so I could pay the bill and finish my mediocre meal.* No apologies: Despite the catalogue of errors there were no apologies or sense of urgency/improvement in service. I waited to get a waiter's attention after finishing my meal to no avail. I had to walk over to the till and ask for the bill, and the doggy bag, which had been forgotten again.* Hostility: Once the waiter brought the bill over, he stood over me as I counted my money out my purse as if I were going to run off without paying. I'm not sure if they were annoyed with us for bringing young children into the restaurant but they sat at the table the whole time and only started crying when we had been waiting around 90 minutes for food to arrive

Great Thai cuisine, amazing location over looking the yacht parking lot at Sentosa Cove. Good menu, staff is nice. Taste is good price is "more than value for money".4 of us had, 3 type of fried rice, 2 type of salads, Tom yum soup, couple of drinks , and it cost us around $40/- per person.Highly recommend for a couple or family dinner out to relax and recharge your batteries .

We were there on Sunday, around 12-1pm. Didn't manage to take photo of the food because we were too hungry. The Phar Thai noodles was good, my Friends ate Seafood Tomyum soup and grill Saba fish with steam rice and seafood fried rice. They were ok with the food as well.Price at Quayside isle might consider as Low range to mid range price. Nice environment
4
We enjoyed the food, with nice fried finger food to start with, and some noodle and rice dishes for the main. Service was efficient and food was tasty, even if the 1 "flame" rating tasted a lot more spicy, and more like 2. Beautiful location at the dock and on the waterfront

Nice ambience good food and great service. Must try the grilled squid and makeral. Service is very good and friendly.

Probably the worse restaurant I've been to in Asia so far. The service is so terrible! I've spoken to the manager and he literally showed that he doesn't care.Sharing a personal experience: I've ordered a squid dish where it states "stir-fried and coated in egg cream", the squid comes like raw in a sort of egg soup, which in addition to looking awful, tastes terrible. I've asked the manager if they could stir-fry it a bit more, he takes the dish, reduces the soup and brings it back after 2 minutes. When I asked if he could change the dish as I am very dissatisfied with the taste and quality, he says he will charge it anyway, because it's been already cooked. This is just one example amongst other poor service details I encountered during my lunch at this restaurant. The other more serious detail is the tummy pain I got in the afternoon after lunch, probably due the use of non fresh ingredients, as prawns where smelly somehow... Just glad I didn't end up with a food poisoning - but some serious stomach ache.So, my advice: avoid this restaurant, it's really terrible

We had a decent lunch here. Good size portions and very tasty food. The service was also pretty decent; friendly and fast.
4
Really good Thai food, nice atmosphere, good value, but the service is poor . Go if you want good food, but give it a miss if you are in a rush
3
Nice ambience if you sit outside. Food is average. Pineapple rice doesn't taste as one, the grill squid is not too bad. The service is not great. The waiter insisted that we have to give the item numbers when we order our food.

We were a little wary that the restaurant was pretty empty but ended up happy with the food and service. We ordered the 2 chicken appetizers, beef and olive fried rice, watermelon fried rice and a beef green curry (which was originally chicken, but they readily agreed to the substitution) The watermelon fried rice sounded strange but turned out well, with generous portions of prawns, squid and mussels. It's a bit sad that they don't have a lot of patronage as the food is quite good

We were a group of 2 families. The staff the restaurant really need training in hospitality management. No greeting, no smile, no checking in even once during our meal. We had to get their attention (wasn't easy) for everything and they almost seemed to be ignoring us. My husband was told to get water from a common table himself after being served twice on the table.... Very rude! They were also totally inflexible with making any changes to their menu for our vegetarian friends. The food itself was decent and tasted good, but overall service (lack of) definitely shadowed the food. We won't be coming back ever!

There was a lot of choice on the menu. We were very happy with our choices. The portions were generous and the food was very good. Lovely atmosphere.
5
Only round the corner for us and we are lucky to have it so close! Whether you eat in or take away the food is always excellent, fresh and spiced to perfection. Relatively cheap beer too for Singapore ($10 a bottle of Chang) is great too...but it's all about the food! The spicy beef special is particularly good. See you again soon

Unpretentious place, nicely situated on the quay. Food was very good. We enjoyed all the Thai dishes we ordered. Relatively inexpensive, SGD 100 for 2 with drinks. Service was good. And a nice sunny day.

Cosy ambience, great and affordable food, by far the best thai restuarant i've been to suitable dining place for couples, families and friends get-together.
3
The cheapest food we could find at sentosa cove as we were on a budget. The food was quite ok for the price, however the staff were less than interested in our existence - it appeared we were bothering their conversation when we arrived. Recommend the deep fried chicken.

New restaurant at Quayside Isle. Great Thai food at a reasonable price. Great location and decor, romantic place for dating couples.
5
We went there for my mother's birthday. The place was cosy and intimate enough for quiet conversations. It was not like those usual thai places where you would expect the place to be stuffy and noisy. The place was unpretentious and the food was surprisingly very well done despite being set in a location that overlooks rich men's yachts. They even went to an extra mile to present my mother a lava cake and ice cream for her birthday. I was only expecting the "good table" that I requested for my mother's birthday hence, the cake was a lovely surprise. I would definitely go back there for another meal next time.
5
Came her to try their famous chili crab, hoever my daughter decided she wanted the fish instead. The meal was very fresh and full of great Singaporean flavours. We had steamed fish, brown crabmeat rice and chicken skewers. Highly recommend. Will be back for the chilli crab next time

This was my first visit to this restaurant and I had been putting off going as I heard the service could be quite slow...but I am happy to say the service was really good. Very nice food and reasonably priced wines. I will definitely be back and this could easily end up as one of my favourites at Quayside isle

Nice ambience, windy, go for the outdoor seating. Something different from dining in shopping malls.We ordered Thai coffee with coconut juice,chicken wing, green curry and olive fried rice with beef slices. Fav got to be the chicken wings, but then again you can hardly go wrong with that dish.Olive rice was a total miss- I've tasted much better white rice elsewhere. Beef slices were rubbery, couldn't taste any marination etc at all. Will recommend diners to try other restaurants along the Quayside Isle. :)
