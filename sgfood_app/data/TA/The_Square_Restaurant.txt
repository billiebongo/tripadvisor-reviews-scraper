The chilli crabs tasted very good with great sauce !
Seafood on ice were fresh too !
The durian penget and dessert selection could be improved though.
Overall, a pleasant dinner with reasonable prices - even special deals for 55 years and above !

The breakfast Buffet was good. Big selection of western and Asian food. Worth it if you are after a good buffet breakfast.

1. In Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay, there's a nice restaurant..."The Square Restaurant", where we tried their very affordable lunch buffet that only costs SS$38++ per person. This hip and modern restaurant boasts an interactive live cooking experience where guests can interact directly with the chefs and have their desired dish prepared in the open kitchen, as they move through the different stations. Swing by and experience an absolute good buffet in Singapore! Located on the 7th floor, The Square buffet is an International buffet that includes Singaporean favorite Dishes like seafood Laksa as well as fresh prawns & mussels, roasted meats, homemade Dim Sum, delicious A-la minute Risotto and a wide range of curries with condiments. The Square Restaurant has a huge range of cocktails made by our experienced bartender mixologist, soft drinks, liquors and wines to accompany your meal.2. As Novotel Singapore Clarke Quay has one of the best or premier locations of hotel in Singapore, definitely this hotel is a very good option for those who wanted to be in the city centre, enjoy the best of nightlife and be near in some of the main tourist destinations like Boat Quay (features historical sites and a buzzing riverfront vibe), Clarke Quay (caters to the party crowd), Robertson Quay (appeals to the leisurely wanderer), Martin Road (also give a peek into the lives of expats in Singapore, as the riverfront teems with joggers, dog walkers, and those getting their caffeine fix over brunch or enjoying a burger and a beer), Chinatown (buying cheap souvenirs and exploring local foods) and Marina Bay (where famous tourist destinations are located like Art Science Museum, Esplanade, Singapore Flyer, Bayfront Bridge, Merlion...to name a few). A must-visit restaurant in Singapore! and we really enjoyed our buffet experience here

This restaurant is a hidden gem and surprises us with the quality of food and warm service. It is really value for money compared to the buffets i had in grand hyatt and shangri-la, which are much more expensive but at par quality. If you are crabs lovers, the quality of crabs served here will wow you. The restaurant is very generous with free flow of crabs and i am amazed at the freshness of these crab meats and the size of the crabs. They usually cause me a bomb to eat in other well known restaurants but here i can have a hearty crab meals. Not forgetting they also come with fresh and juicy prawns, and we are happy to have the same serving a few times.Laksa is another must try and you can choose from an array of condiments which includes seafood. This is very unique compared to other restaurants and it matches very well with the savoury spicy gravy, which we love very much. Durian is another of our favorite and here they serve 'durian pengat', which is pudding equivalent as dessert. I spread the durian pengat on top of plain crackers and add on a spinach on top, and it tastes heavenly. The chef George John and his team are warm and the speed of service is amazing. Being a local, this restaurant is really a hidden gem. We will definitely come back again.

Family dinner on a Saturday at SGD58++. The highlights of the dinner spread were chilli crab, cold seafood and the dessert varieties. The chilli crab was a favorite among the locals. Do not expect high standard of chilli crab in buffet serving. Oyster was also popular but there was limited quantity each time they brought out for serving. So expect to wait for 5-10mins. I enjoyed the wide selection of dessert. My aged mother wanted a cup of hot chocolate and the restaurant got her one without charge. Worth a visit.

The buffet breakfast at The Square has something for everyone. Lots of ethnic food choices: Japanese, Chinese, Indian, American, New Zealand, Malay, European. The only thing that was not readily available was decaf coffee - you have to ask for it.The offerings change daily, so no worries about repetition if you are at the hotel for several days. The cost per person for the full breakfast (as opposed to Continental) is $30 per person. With an Accor Membership card, the breakfast buffet price is $30 for 2 people! Such a bargain! Much less expensive than paying for your breakfast as part of your room reservation. In addition to the buffet offerings there is a "cook to order" egg station, but I must admit, I didn't try it. There were fresh eggs sunny side up - hot and fresh - as part of the buffet! That along with fresh fruit and luscious pastry (and decaf coffee) was all I wanted

Booked a lunch buffet on 27th August 2017 to hold my family gathering. The place was empty during our time there, which made it slightly quieter than I would expect - I liked it. Food wise was slightly disappointing because I've seen a bigger spread in other hotels offering the same price. The live cooking station was most of the time unattended, and another customer had to walk to the door (where the kitchen is) to signal the staff. Staff who came out didn't seem happy or apologetic when he came out from the door. Crabs were available but it wasn't fresh in my opinion, the shells were also too hard. Fish was bad as it had a fishy smell. The dessert station was serving liimited dessert. Overall I guess I will not go back.

Holidaying from Australia we had a beautiful buffet meal with plenty of variety from the salad bar to assorted seafood and meat dishes to the amazing spread of desserts. A big thankyou to Logan and the friendly efficient staff for making our last night in Singapore a memorable enjoyable occasion can't wait to come back

The Square Restaurant located on the 7th floor Novotel Clark Quay, offers a great international buffet to satisfy all tastes. I was extremely surprised with the buffet on offer, It was a mix of both some Singapore - Asian food, but also had quite good selection of western dishes. Great Laksa it taste really good, and cooked to order, other dishes such as: seared sea bass was cooked perfectly, and the other selections such as fresh seafood, and the roast beef on the carving station, was also scrumptious. The restaurant was quite busy and noisy at the time. But overall nice atmosphere.. And nice food .The waiters and staff was fantastic, they presented flawless service, friendly and professional. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, evening. Great place for a sit down dinner buffet
5
The 1st impression is Mr Logan...the Mgr of the outlet, greeted us with a warm smile, took us to our seat and showed us the offering. The variety isn't much, but it's sufficient and yet classy.He gave us a chilli oyster shot, must try...., other must try's are chilli crab, the fried rice...simple but tasty, sashimis are fresh, the mutton dish from the cold side and the Indian style are awesome as well. The oysters, mussels and prawn are fresh and tasty, but my favourite is the cold mackerel....I didn't try other dishes but quite contended with the array of cheese, Singapore laksa and the above.., the durian pengat and bread pudding are delicious.Quite a wide variety of desserts and salad options. The staffs are very friendly, the 2 Indian chefs are very helpful, talking to the guests and assisting them well. Service staff are prompt, maybe also it wasn't busy thus it was enjoyable evening.The ambience is great and kudos to all the staff. Good place and indeed value for money and we enjoyed i

A good selection of food with healthier choice, and yet cater to the needs of the children. Nice ambience with a very friendly restaurant manager who always attend to the needs of the customers.
A place for another great night out with friends ðŸ˜€

Restaurant got a nice big table for my dinner gathering. Everyone had something delightful to eat...salads, jelly, cakes, laksa... Wallet friendly too as they offered senior citizen n kids' discounts even on a public holiday.

limited food
not bad, food was good
quite a variety of dessert and cake.
like the pasta section. nicely done.
services was average, took awhile to get someone refill the drink

Who wouldn't like the offering described on the publicity for The Square. The realty is, however, somewhat different in that all of the Cauvery items (in my view the preferred foods) are set behind a counter and cannot be accessed in simple butter style. Fine, one would think, the chef/catering staff will surely serve what you need. Not in The Square. In the time I had lunch there, I waited and waited for someone to carve some roast lamb for me. In the end, I went behind the counter and lifted a piece from the carving tray (hygienically, with a fork and without touching the remaining food). Next up, I'm waiting for a piece of chicken from the rotary. No sign of assistance so I went to the restaurant reception. The man there confidently claimed that he would "try to find the chef". It would have been fully 10 mins later before a kitchen assistant served my food. Novotel, within which they manage The Square, is supposedly a 4+ star hotel. On the basis of their food offering, this is definitely NOT the case. I recommend that you avoid The Square. Unfortunately, I will be taking around 90 seminar delegates there for lunch later in the week (pre-booked). I am not looking forward to the prospect.

It has been quite a while since we last dined here (which I did a review but at another well known local food website then) and so we decided to revisit this place on a weekday when we happened to be off.Located on the 7th storey in the Novotel Hotel at Clark Quay (next to the Liang Court Shopping Mall along River Valley Road), the restaurant has undergone some renovations and now its much more nicer with cosy and comfortable ambience.We were ushered to our table upon arriving at the restaurant, about 12pm and the restaurant was already quite crowded and we were surprised with that since it was a weekday. But most of the diners were expected to be professionals working nearby and coming by here for their lunch!Well, the restaurant is now much well lay-out and structured, separated into various sections ranging from cold and salad bar, cooked food, live-cooking station, drink and ice cream, desserts and fruits sections. Will say the food variety and spread were quite extensive (at least more than during our previous visit). Credit must be given to them.What we felt impressive about the food mainly Western and Asian that included the roast duck (very good, fragrant and yummy) though the roast chicken was a bit too dry; the roast beef was a "must try" too, others like the fresh and stir-fried prawns, curry chicken were pretty awesome. And of course, the tom yam soup was good.At the live cooking station, you could choose your own ingredients for your pasta or spaghetti and laksa, a local verstion of curry noodles. Well, would say the pasta was ordinary and passable, though would expect it to be better in terms of taste. The laksa was generally ok, but the lack of coconut milk (or too little) made the "one of the local must try" dish a bit disappointing and the gravy was not hot when served.The dessert/pastry section was good, nothing to complain as they offered quite a good spread ranging from cakes, jelly, cut fruits, ice cream etc. Overall, they were yummy.Service was good. Staff were friendly and efficient in clearing the used plates and utensils from time to time and our iced water were refilled regularly too without the need to call them to do so. Staff also initiated conversations, asking diners how they feel about the food and soliciting for feedback etc.As we dined, it started pouring outside. From the restaurant, there is a side door where one could go outside and have a good view of the swimming pool and surrounding view of the highrise buildings etc. But the door was closed, possibly because it was raining outside and prevent water droplets to come inside the restaurant from the wet shoes of the people. There was also no one swimming in the pool then. It was good value for money, considering the spread and quality of food and good service. If didn't remember wrongly, the price per person was around $31-$32. Reasonable.We did enjoy our meal here and will surely revisit again in the near future

tasty pepper crab which is fresh and big. the chicken, lamb, and prawn are tasty. the durian penyat is a must try. there is also good coffee. enjoyed with my girlfriend who was chilled and delighted with the food.the cakes were average thou.will go agai

Travelling with friends enroute to Kota Kinabalu, we stayed at the Novotel and ate twice in three nights at The Square Restaurant. The buffet is very extensive, inluding Singapore Chilli Crab and also Ginger Crab. Fresh seafood, (prawns, oysters,mussels) are in profusion as is other Asian specialities, such as sushi.Our evenings were made very special by the excellent service and assistance of Maitre D' Logan. Being so close to Asian New Year, he personally made a "lucky" salad for us, which 4 of us shared. It was so delicious, we are now trying to re-create it at home. Logan also also supplied the recipe
5
This is a great restaurant for entertaining large groups or enjoying a delectable buffet with friends. Breakfasts are ample as well with different stands for breads, cakes and muffins, a variety of cereals, eggs, fried noodles, waffles, pancakes, and fruit. It might be good to add more local favorites for tourists to sample. Prices were quite reasonable. What makes this restaurant extra special, though, is superb service. The manager and servers are attentive, friendly and outgoing, making sure every customer is satisfied. Well done
3
Went for the buffet breakfast as walk-in guests, usual price at s$26++. the spread was pretty good with the staple cereals,bakery,juices & cold cuts. There was also a substantial choices of Korean & Indian food,possibly to cater to the guests profile. What's lacking was our local favs like fried carrot cake & dim sum like har kow/siew mai.It was about 70-80% filled & staffs handled the guests well.
4
Excellent local and international cuisine for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is good. What made the meals more appetizing is the friendly staff: Mohamed - Restr Manager - good skills and eye for details. Ikhsan- server, hardworking and Dilah - server, always with a smile. Keep it up ! Service is what makes a world of difference
3
Food overall was ok but the replenishing of food was very slow and I guess due to under staffing service was not great too.
3
they have a very few veg options, hence if you are vegetarian, this would not really be a place you want to have a buffet.
4
It's good for the family especially with young kids, as it has an area of kid play zone. Seafood and the duck is fresh and good, it's a nice place to dine.
4
We got a pretty good deal from online website and paid with voucher hence it was value for money. Nice selection and enjoyed ourselves!
2
Was there for Christmas Eve dinner with 10 others......the buffet was pretty sufficient but towards the last hour or so, the live section was hardly manned or replenished.The biggest disappointment was that the dinner was to be accompanied with free flow of beer, wine & soft drinks......we had to constantly remind the service staff to top up even for plain water. The wine was metallic in taste, & who serves non carbonated, luke warm half filled coke...they DO! It seems that the management is not to darn happy to have free flow....if not why such bad drinks then??
5
My daughter and I had lunch at the Square recently. She had the Hawaiian pizza, while I had the slow braised mutton curry. The mutton was tender, cooked with the right level of spicy-ness. My daughter finished the thin crust pizza all by herself. I want to commend Logan for the attentive and prompt service provided to us
1
The selection of buffet was mediocre and the restaurant did not bother to top up the food. Service from the staff was also bad. When i enquired 3 times if they were going to top up the Satay, they did not even respond and merely walked away, only to top up the satay station with 10 miserable satay sticks after 30 minutes. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. It was definitely NOT value for money
3
Inside Novotel there is the possibility to have lunch or dinner in this restaurant . My choice has been on buffet formula. Food is good, well presented with "many" colors, with good variety of both seafood and meal.Taste is fine and staff is professional . Good for me
3
Had an online voucher for two, so I went with a friend on a Saturday evening. Online reservation was very convenient and they were very nice to call a day before to remind me of our booking.Arriving at 6pm, we were the first to arrive for the dinner. Food was nice and the selection was ok. A combination of western and local dishes. The seafood section, which we didn't try because of health issues, seems to be popular with other dinners. The dessert section is also ok but nothing remarkable. One thing I like is that the place is not that crowded considering we went on a Saturday evening. Will go here if there is a good online deal, if not, I will give it some thought
5
Having become accustomed to in Singapore that you get what you pay for, it was a very pleasant surprise to have an impeccable buffet dinner for a faily reasonable price. Food was very good with a full range of Asian / international dishes, overall an excellent value
5
Nice ambience and good spread.
Loved the dessert especially the durian paste and the nonya kueh kuehs. Couldn't stop myself and kept going for more helpings of the durian desserts.....at least 5 times.
4
Food was of good standard and the price was really reasonable. However service can be improved as we were rarely seen in the corner of the restaurant
4
It's more 3.5 star rating rather than 4. Good deal with the free flow beer for dads. Good range of local dishes and international.
4
The food had a good spread of Chinese, Continental and Indian dishes. A live counter was also there. I enjoyed the soup, Laska and grilled chicken. The dessert spread was also good and service was prompt
4
Went for Mother's Day promotion. The staff were very attentive to our needs. The buffet was great! I especially liked the nasi lemak risotto and the durian ice cream!
1
went there @ 9pm with a 50% off. The place is quite empty when we reach there, cleanliness and ambience was quite alright. As we already saw the menu online, we wasn't expecting big spread of food but hoping the quality will be great. honestly, the food is really bad, the seafood like prawns, oysters wasn't fresh, chili crab is the same and the sauce didn't even taste like chili crab. the pasta station is the wrost, when we want to order, no one was there, we have to tell the cleaner to inform the cook to come. we ordered aglio olio, it taste so bland, no taste of garlic, chili or I should say no flavor at all. lucky I went there with 50% off, will not go back again
2
Went for GSS Kids dine free dinner buffet on a Saturday. Was very disappointed with the limited variety of cold cuts and cooked items. The black pepper crabs meant for dinner buffet were quite palatable as the sauce was well done but the crabs lack firmness and sweetness so I suspect they used Vietnamese crabs. Chilli crabs were very lacking in the consistency and spiciness so give it a miss.The chicken kebab or schwarma wraps suited my taste and found to be one of the best items around. Raw oysters were fresh albeit too small to satisfy the palate as each person could only obtain about 2 pieces each time. There was only white fish sashimi and no sushi but seasoned jellyfish was available. Black mussels were too salty while the tiger prawns were too bland. The laksa and pasta stations were very popular and suited the young and old.The buffet offered very good salads amd desserts. But be warned of queer flavours in some cakes such as wasabi, chocolate ginger etc. There was only a big label w all the flavours written on it instead of individual labelling so venture w caution. Durian pengat was delightful so be quick to get some if you like durians. There's free flow of soft drinks and 6 ice cream flavours but dun expect anything fanciful.The tables were all occupied and service slow as only a handful of servers were around to clear the plates and needed reminders to fill the water glasses.At $58++ for an adult on a weeknight, I'll rather pay a bit more to dine at Carousel or switch to Window on the Park at lower cost
3
I ate in this restaurant as part of a hotel stay. The breakfast is inclusive in my room rate. Children can eat in the restaurant free if they are below 12.There's a range to choose from - asian, western, fruits, beverages. But don't expect top quality from the buffet line. The offerings are more than enough for one to sample.Service in the restaurant is good. The waitresses are attentive and clear your plates promptly. I would think this service is also present in their lunch and dinner sittings.I won't mind coming back for their lunch buffets to try in future
1
the variety was limited and on top of that the cold seafood range (especially the mussels) were disappointing. i had actually gone during Mother's Day weekend and thought that it would be a good place to celebrate but the quality of food isn't even up to standards judging that each person pays about $68++. I would definitely not recommend this place to anyone unless you can't be bothered what you're stuffing into your body.
4
We stayed at the Novotel in Singapore, breakfast included each morning. The Square supplied a vast array of food for breakfast and didn't disappoint. From Pho to scrambled eggs and all stops in between. Fresh juice, fresh fruit, create your own muesli etc etc _ too many option to type in. good restaurant layout, with a kid's hub just around the corner, which included xbox and other interactive games. Pool just through the glass doors. We also looked at the evening menu, buffet style and a large range here as well. We were often out for our evening meal, so couldn't sample the menu
5
the food here was wonderful. Cheap as you will get anywhere. A huge variety and very tasty with wonderful service
5
Great range of International and asian dishes for buffet breakfast.
Coffee machines easy to operate.
Very nice selection of cold meets and salad.
Choices of bread and danish pastries
Excellent bread and butter pudding
4
Buffet breakfast, and either a la carte or buffet dinner. Wide range of Western or Eastern (Chinese, Malay, Thai) cuisine.

Located on the seventh floor in one of Singapore's five star hotels, The Square offers a place where diners can relax, unwind and spend quality time with their loved ones. The Square offers a fine dining ambience, with soft music playing in the background and gives diners a good view of the urban landscapes surrounding the hotel. The seating is spacious and comfortable, hence conducive for large family/social gatherings. They have an excellent spread for a dinner buffet - comprising of international buffet flavours - variety of salads (e.g. chicken, beef, potato or "make-your-own"), cold seafood dishes encompassing fresh oysters, mussels, prawns, jellyfish/baby octopus, dim sum, baked ham with honey, different types of pasta (spaghetti, penne etc.), sweet potato gratin, seafood paella, grilled chicken wraps, different types of bread and cheese (Camembert, Swiss-style cheese such as Emmental etc.) speckled with Asian/Singaporean delicacies - Black pepper crab, Fried kway teow, Fried rice, curry chicken, laksa, Yong Tau Foo. For desserts they have bread pudding, chocolate fondues, cakes, fruit tart/puddings and apple crumble, to name a few. They also have their very own unique creation - a dish called "durian penyet" - a local Singaporean style durian pudding dessert, made from durian puree. Despite the rather large spread, the quality of each dish was not compromised. Having a taste-bud for rich flavours, my personal favourites from the restaurant would be their black pepper crab, sweet potato gratin, curry chicken, seafood paella, pumpkin soup and of course, their unforgettable "durian penyet". The Square is definitely a great place to bring and pamper your loved ones for dinner
4
The restaurant is on the seventh floor of the Novotel hotel at Clarke Quay, it is bright and airy with views over the pool and city. We tried the Singapore laksa and Singapore chicken with rice, both were generous portions and extremely tasty meals, highly recommended. The staff were suitably attentive and the meals were reasonably priced at approx $14 (Singaporean) each. They also have a very nice looking buffet but we didn't try it
5
We ate here during December and the menu was a festive buffet dinner. It was an all you can eat international buffet which cost $58 per adult pre taxes. There was a good selection of foods - lots of sea food, turkey, salads and desserts, There was also some interesting food stations which made the experience fun actually. There was a souvalaki station, noodles station and pasta station. I tried the pasta where the chef made the sauces as you watched, I tried the carbonara which was amazing. The desserts do need a mention as they were exquisite. The bread and butter pudding was one of the best I have ever tasted.The atmosphere was buzzing , the food great , the staff were very attentive / friendly and the table we had next to the pool was great. I would definitely recommend The Square they were great when they were so busy which speaks volumes
3
We come here because of the wonderful indonesia food event. As what i remember there are tahu gejrot (fried tofu with spicy sweet sauce), soto bandung (beef soup with fried soy bean and other condiments), opor ayam (chicken cooked with coconut milk), chicken satay, gado2 (mixed vegetables served with oeanut sauce), beef rendang, curry vegetables. Indonesian food taste not bad.They also serve other food such as japanese sushi (not fresh it taste really hard as it just come from fridge). As i can see there are shawarma, roasted beef, chilli crab, cold sea food, salad etcDessert served such as pudding, jelly, nyonya kueh, etc also taste not ba

This restaurant was presentable, classy, nice layout. What lay beneath was the opposite. If you can pay $58++ for nice dessert n coffee, you're at the right place. Everything else was below average and poor! Sushi at the supermarket is 10 times better! It was beyond belief! Our business associate was so apologetic for choosing The Square, that he bought us drinks to say sorry
3
I had an Accor hotel membership which came with a voucher for this restaurant. Hence, brought the whole family out here. Our kids were well taken care of with their own kiddy table mats and utensils which made them very happy. The staff took care of us throughout and were helpful. The main spread is not vast it had what we normally go for like oysters; sushi; sashimi; a bit of local food (laksa; Mee siam) and some western dishes. You can order up your choice of pasta which is done on spot. The dessert section was the best part. The durian pudding; chocolate mousse cake; apricot cake were really good. Had ice cream wit) rainbow sprinkles to keep the kids happy. Overall, while it's not a very wide spread, it was adequate for us. The service and ambiance made the experience pleasant for us and the desserts made us happy
2
We were there for dinner and had the buffet: there were posters and flyers vanting the nice cuisine of the moment with beautiful pictures etc...yeah, i know, this should have warned us.Well, to start, the wines list by the glass is poor: 2 Chilean brands, each of poor quality.Then the buffet itself looks nice, but that's it indeed.The so called tuna sashimi is a vulgar chewy tuna, not even properly sliced (any decent Japanese chef would have had a heart attack), and of poor taste.The grilled pork was in some watery juice/sauce and really average.We had also some chilli crab, very disappointing by the Singapore standards, and so small that the time and energy spent cracking the legs and claws (yes, because they have not been pre cracked, as it is standard...) are not worth the small quantity of meat you are getting. Besides, the chilli sauce is of an average standard too.Desserts are average as well: panacotta with redberries; i doubt the lime sorbet had even just one drop of lime juice as the color was artificial green and the taste was terrible.The chocolate ice cream certainly does not contain much real chocolate etc...Finally the service is average, we were forced after some waiting time to get up and go to the cashier to ask for a glass of wine!Forget this place, definitely not worth it.It is very easy to go out around the Quays area and eat much better for cheaper
4
I have the Accor Advantage Plus card. And this restaurant is our favorite place to use that card.The atmosphere is good, seldom over crowded. The staff is very attentive and are ready with a smile. They often go a little extra further than expected.The restaurant serves Asian and international fare. I find that there is no stand-out offerings.The food is good. They normally have oysters and crabs on weekends. The sushi offerings are weak. The salad is adequate. The pasta and risotto is above average. The dessert and cheese selections are also above average. There is normally durian puree but I am ambivalent to that. The ice cream is generic and disappointing
3
good range of breakfast foods, but service and cleanliness could be better. Coffee is absolutely terrible and I would avoid.Gets very busy at breakfast and the standards were quite low, food was not quite warm but there is a good range of international options as you would expect in a hotel
2
I had dined at The Square some three years ago. My dining experience three years back was not very good. I remember the chilli crabs served that night were not fresh. I have given this restaurant a miss for the couple of years as the unsatisfactory experience is fresh in my mind. But I thought today that perhaps, it was a remote case and things might be better now. So I decided to give The Square a second chance and dined again with them this evening. Unfortunately, the chilli and curry crab served for dinner tonight was a disappointment again. Not only that, the fish, vegetable/mushroom and dim sum served at the buffet were not even warm. I brought this matter to the attention of one staff member who promised to check it out. Service in clearing the used plates was slow today. I have come back with my third round of food but the plates used for the first and second rounds were still lying on my table. Good thing about The Square is that it has a good variety of cakes, about 7 to 8 kinds! With the repeated bad experience, I guess that I will not be visiting The Square again unless someone gives me the assurance that the restaurant has improved both in its food quality and service
3
The Square is another Christmas option for those who are inclined towards local delights and those who are getting bored of all the turkey and trimmings. Besides the usual Black Pepper or Singapore Chilli crabs, the Indonesia Chilli crabs are worth a try as the sauce is piquant and tangy. I have not yet tried the authentic version but I love this more than our local chilli crabs as they held a more robust spice identity.Staples of the festive menu includes the roasted turkey with giblet or cranberry sauce, or Grilled Beef wrapped with garlic cheese & herbs. But it seemed like the strength lie in the pastas or risottos that are prepared at the live station. For full review and pics, visit blog under user's profil

Located on the 7th floor of Novotel Clarke Quay Hotel, international buffet restaurant The Square exudes a simple but elegant and cosy ambience, with a good mix of quality food on display at various stations.There was a huge variety of items ranging from the salads and seafood to local delights such as char kuey teow, chilli crab, laksa, mee siam etc. Then there were the delectable desserts and for this period, some festive items like turkey, roast lamb, log cakes etc. It was a lovely sight to see all these .The Canadian oysters were fresh and juicy - lovely delicacies at all times, especially when paired with Tabasco sauce and lemon squeezes.Next, the Cheese Chicken Risotto - redolent of delicious cheese flavor and cooked with very tender chicken meat. The hotel manager prepared another bowl specially for me later - with dashes of white wine into the risotto - everyone who tried it agreed that the flavor was doubly enhanced because the white wine brought out the natural flavor of the cheese and chicken further.Then the Chilli Crab were being served. As it was Indonesian-style preparation, the gravy was very spicy, but complemented the sweetness of the crab really well. We were tempted to ask for some rolls to dip into the gravy but we were very stuffed at this point in time.The Durian Penget was the other item that was very strongly recommended - a durian cream dream for durian lovers. It was sticky, rich and thick with durian's fragrance, butter smooth except for bits of real durian flesh mixed into itFor full review and more photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/media-invite-dinner-at-square.htm

Being an Advantage Plus member, I decided to try The Square restaurant. To be very frank, I honestly think its alittle overpriced for the Seafood affair ($68++) including Water, Coffee and Tea. I did not see any Salmon Sashimi but only Sushi which was hard (guess it wasn't thawn enough) and Smoked Tuna and some cold cuts. Saw some Oysters, Mussels, Calms and prawns which took some time to replenish. The salad selection is small but quality was there. The local selection is small too, but quality was difinetly there. The Spanish paella was delightful however the risotto the chef cooked was a MAJOR let down...too dry. Pasta was nice. The dessert selection was alright...quality was fine, but the choc foutain was kinda cold???. Service wise was excellent, all were professional but could see some overlooking happening since the restaurant was difinetly understaffed. Another thing that bothers me is how the Hotel, in this day and age where Technology is a must, does not even have a Samsung charger and only Apple charger. I asked a few staff if they had, all said no. So maybe here's a point to improve on...even more so being a Business hotel too.Will I come back, maybe? But hopefully the selection and quality will improve knowing that this restaurant has been here for quite a long time

The day I was dining I was having a severe cough that I almost lost my appetite. A honey lemon at that point of time would be the best remedy to calm my coughs. However, even without a request made by me, Prabu, one of The Square's staff just brought over a teapot and a cup with honey lemon in it. When I told him I didn't request for honey lemon, he said "no worries, it is on the house, its because he saw me coughing very severely hence decided to brew an aromatic pot of honey lemon for me". Such a simple action like this actually made my day!! I would definitely be back again to dine in

We came for Breakfast recently. I was with my pregnant wife. We were informed that the Breakfast Buffet is about SGD29. So we told them that since there was only half an hour left to the buffet it was not worthwhile. We were about to leave when the Assistant Restaurant Manager, Mr Mohd overheard our conversation and came over. To cut a long story short, he noticed that my wife was pregnant and offered us the buffet for SGD15 each since there was only half an hour left and stating that Novotel gives priority to people with special needs (disabled, pregnant, etc). Of course, we took his generous offer. He also helped my wife carry some food back to our table. To summarize, we would like to thank and commend Mr Mohd for his help. We feel that good service, especially in Singapore is quite hard to come by. Its not the discount that was important, it was the fact that he noticed. In regards to the breakfast itself, honestly, it was very average and I would imagine that I would have been unsatisfied had I paid the full price

We ate breakfast twice here during our recent visit to Singapore. The first time was later in the morning and was a much more pleasant experience than the second which was during a busy time.They supply a great buffet with a large range of European and Asian food. We ate fresh fruit, cereal, hot food and pastries which was all delicious. The staff were very friendly and attentive but could not keep up with demand during the busy time. I chose to use the coffee machine because the coffee I had been served was too cold and strong for me. Both coffee machines were either out of water or needed cleaning. When I pointed this out to one of the staff the problem was fixed quickly and the Cappucino I obtained was to my liking. Have breakfast here later during service and it should be a better experience
