Though the deco is not impressive, it makes up with very good food and bouncing castle, rainbow sand play and cupcakes for the kids. Pretty good service too.

The place was very relaxing, even had a band playing! Food was delicious but Abit pricey. Definitely going back again!

The fish and chip was a surprise... It's a deep fried fish serve with fries and tartar sauce and I like it very much. My kid ate the Bolognese spaghetti n she like it too... Nice place to chill out with friends or family.

Staff welcome regulars back and remember the food and beverage preferred. Variety of choices on the menu, delicious as well. I would highly recommend the tuna collar! Dessert is a must, you will be surprised. Cost is slightly above average but with the quality of food and environment, why not. Great for families as well

Polite & attentive staff. Cosy ambience, mini bouncy castle and kids play area to entertain the little ones, much to kids' delight!We ordered a dessert to and not only were candles provided, the waiter even offered wordings! To complete the personal touch, the waiters sang "Happy Birthday" as they served us. Our 4 year old was overwhelmed!

Came here for breakfast with kids. They have a bouncy castle indoors which is ideal, as it is airconditioned even whilst the kids ran around. Can't remember the names, but the croissant was really nice and crispy and fluffy. The poached eggs were good and so was the extra english pork sausage I ordered. The kids had baked ham and cheese on croissant and that was ok but nothing to shout about. The mocha lacked punch but I guess you don't come to such places for the coffee :

Honestly, we didn't order any food or what nots, we had dinner elsewhere and saw this bistro with a bouncing castle inside, so we thought of chilling out with our 2 our old kid. Great idea actually, finally we found a place to let our kid expend her energy and we can chill out at the same time.It would be good if there are more tables & chairs placed around the bouncing castle so the parents can chill and watch their kids play.Safety wise, there are some cushions and paddings on the floor surrounding the castle, which is a thoughtful move, since the parents will be more at ease knowing their kids are safe. Maybe they can fence up the castle area to prevent the kids from running out of the area? Plus slightly thicker and more adequate padding will make it even safer for the kids

4-8pm the Bistro welcomed its patrons with 1 4 1 drinks of beer and wine from S$11-13 of the same pairing.With a relaxed mood overlooking the East Coast beach at the distance browse through the menu slowly.We started off with foie gras well seared with toast below and sauces of orange marmalade and chocolade sauces drizzled on the palate was good but the portion is too small for S$19.We also tried the salmon sashimi with cold angel hair spaghetti and the Japanese fusion sauces were very light with wasabi mirin soy sauce that doesnt burst through your ears and nose for S$14.Our mains were lamb rack medium done, pork cheek, and beef short ribs. All were well cooked and flavorful and tender. The beef short rib would be better if it was marinated less salty.All in the dinner was S$175 with 4 beers.The live band only start at 8.45-11.45pm on Fri and Sat .... would have liven our wkends further if they start at 7pm as i was told it is a youngster 3 piece band.... awwww i miss it til my next visit
