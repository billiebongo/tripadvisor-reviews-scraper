We ordered Quick Lunch - North Indian for $ 7.80
Was it good? We didn’t leave anything on the plate and we will come again.

We visited so many hawker centres and this was by far the best of the lot. Super clean and a great ambience. We had pad thai and satay from the stalls towards the back, all delicious and ridiculously cheap. We visited other Food Republic's across Singapore and this was by far my favourite

Food Republic Foodcourts are sprinkled all round Singapore. Visit any shopping mall, and there’s bound to be a food court either in the basement floors or in the upper floors.Food Republic is a well known brand, and the different outlets offer a variety of Asian foods and token “Western” food like fried chicken, fish and chips, schnitzels or sausages and steak.Prices do vary by a couple of dollars depending on where it is located, higher for downtown locations and lower for if it’s in the suburban heartlands. However, you can be assured it won’t break the bank as you can get a good meal with a soft drink from $8 and up. The 7% gst is included in the price, but there is no service charge as it is essentially self-serve. You order, pay up and collect your food when it is ready.No worries if you don’t speak the local lingo. Each stall displays photos of the menu items with numbers and prices, so just point and hold up the requisite number of fingers to indicate your choice

Hokkien prawn noodles and fried eggs with oysters are very good. I can never have enough of the water chestnut juice. To the lady at the stall which sells fried prawn cake and meehun, I am buying 2 prawn cakes just to sample the taste and will come back for more if it is indeed tasty. Your approach of setting minimum quantity to buy and forcing customers to buy more will only turn your customers away, insulting talk in Chinese won’t help either as your customers may understand the language
5
We loved everything we ate here! We got a variety of traditional Singapore foods like hokkien prawn mee, fried carrot cake, and popiah and loved everything. We tried food from four different stalls and everything was consistently good. I think you're experience at food courts is highly dependent on where you go and what you order, but we liked the food options more at Food Republic than Lau Pa Sat. My only regret is that we stopped by on our last night in Singapore so we were able to eat here more than once

Most food courts in Singapore don't turn me one way or the other, being as they are as fairly ubiquitous all around the island. I'm not saying the food's poor; if anything, you'll find what most visitors would expect at one - good food at fairly decent prices (although this food court chain does tend to be pricier than others), communal seating, and comfortable surroundings. What I did find a different here was that the interior decor was really quite attractive. Its location, right next to the monorail station to Sentosa Island, also couldn't be more convenient for folks feeling peckish either before or after a visit there
5
Got to this food court after using the Sentosa Express monorail from Sentosa Island. Food court was clean, spacious and well decorated with a great atmosphere. Enjoy meals from many different vendors. Meals are so well priced. I had the sambal chicken but did not check the name of the vendor so I cannot recommend the actual food stall. The sambal chicken was amazing. There are also vendors that come around to your tables offering drinks for purchase which is very convenient. The food court offers a “street food” type atmosphere within a cool, clean shopping centre.
4
When you are in vivo city for shopping or to go to sentosa,drop by at Food Republic for breakfast or lunch or dinner and you will have hearty meal whether you are a local or tourist. Though price are a little bit higher if compare to normal foodcourt which you can easily see all over the city,it's still reasonable.Near by mono rail counter to sentosa.
4
Almost a month ago, i frequented VivoCity but we had dinner at Marché by Mövenpick. Then I saw The Food Republic which took me back to the memories I had when I was in Singapore for the first time. We had lunch here prior to going to Sentosa before.So I took my partner as it was his first time in VivoCity. We went around and got befuddled with what choice we will able to make as everything seemed delectable.So since we were in Singapore, we settled for Laksa and Char Kway Teow.We ended up a few pounds heavier on our way back to the hotel
3
For a food court, it's quite pricey. Better spend your money on hawker centers in other places rather here as you'll get the same menu cheaper and better. The interior and design of this food court is nice. You have to be ready that your food will be cleared by busser without even asking if you're done already or finished, a little courtesy is appreciated. We ordered a veggie rice meal, 3 types of veggie and plain rice at about $9. which we really feel not worth the price. Should go safe with Chicken rice set at Sergeant's at $5. An order of Hokkien Mee at $10 for 1 person and $15 for 2 seems bit pricey also. Anyway its only our opinion, if you have the budget then go ahead. Its pricey due to location as its in the mall
4
Another great food court.
I order hainanese chicken rice from Sergeant counter.
The chicken is tender and juicy, while the sauce is just right.
The price is reasonable.
You can see my travel picture at my Instagram : @adjimantoro
5
Had a great meal for sgd $7. Plenty of variety from many vendors. A value gor money proposition you cant go past.
5
The food court is beautiful but the main point is the awesome food there!!! Big recommandation for the stand 'Thu Thu' by Little Hanoi.. the best Vietnamese bahn mi there ever...totally perfect.
4
This is comparable with Kopitiam but I like the one located in Vivo City more because of it's enchanted design.
4
Want to dine with lots of choices while near Sentosa in Singapore? Better go to Food Republic at Vivo City. The place is very good!
5
It is a food court where you would find Singapore's local food and a few international choices. I would recommend the Fried Hokkien Mee, Chicken Wings, Rojak and the hotpot here. Most of the times seats are hard to find as a lot of tourists dine here. You can have your meals here before or after going to Sentosa as it is located beside the Sentosa Express monorail in Vivo City.

Loved the Peranakan food here. Value for money and since I was alone, I can't go to a Peranakan restaurant and order dishes. Many variety and specialities here, Babi ponteh, buah keluak chicken, curry chicken and if you order the set lunch, you get a main dish and two sides. There were about 8 side dishes ranging from different vegetables, tauhu to omelet. The portion was very generous for a food court and they were generous with their gravies too. Although the buah keluak chicken doesn't come with the actual nuts, enough has been mixed into the gravy to tickle your tastebuds. Won't mind to pay for the actual nuts though....Had the cactus-like vegetable although I don't know what's the name. It's crunchy and well seasoned and met my quota of green veggie intake for the day. My second side dish was the tauhu and it came with tiny shrimps with gravy. Yummy and healthy as well. The price is very reasonable, less than $10. This stall sells Peranakan dessert as well but I haven't tried any. The sago gula Melaka will be next on my list. However I bought the rainbow kueh lapis before but it's more like the healthy cake version of lapis. I prefer the heavy duty, buttery, oily Indonesian version. This food court can get very crowded during lunch. One trick is to sit at the coffee joint (Toast Box) but please buy a cup of coffee from them.
4
Food Republic is a great little food court beneath Orchard Road. It's a little dearer than some of the nearby food courts (e.g. the Lucky Plaza) which probably explains why it isn't jam-packed. However I would say the quality is a little higher and justifies the price. A range of Asian styles are available. I had a delicious Vietnamese beef salad from Little Hanoi. The juice bar with chilled fresh fruit is also excellent on a steamy Singapore day
1
My visit today to this food court was bad result. No table (crowded like so so so crowded).3 When we already book 2 table they (resto PIC) ask us to move due to 2 table inspite of 1. Food were unpredictable when it will come. Not doing this again during 11 am till 3 pm
5
I love this Asian food village in Singapore. Aside from having lots of Asian food choices, such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Malaysian, Indonesian, Indian, and of course Singaporean food, the ambiance is also great. It feels like you're in a historical Asian setting. We ate chicken rice, laksa, popiah, carrot cake, and rojak
4
This is by far one of the most comprehensive food court to have both international and local favourite dishes (such as Bak Kut Teh or pork rib soup); char kway teow, etc. that one must try.
4
We ate chicken rice, fish ball soup, bakut teh and pork bakpau. All of them are delicious. We always ate at Food Republic if we go to Sentosa ( Vivocity ).
5
Loved the ambiance of the place, gotta say prolly one of the best looking food courts I've ever been to. So many different cuisines to chooses from and the prices are quite affordable. The food is really good!
4
The Indonesian food here was amazing and it was a nice break from the heat. There are people that come around with drink carts it you want something different to drink. For a food court this was excellent. Try Indonesian Padang, you can't go wrong.
5
One word - Amazing.
This can't be missed, such a great selection and great prices for an urban developed city. The Katsu curry and Duck dishes were our fav from two of the vendors. Definitely go!
4
I love the concept. Different cuisine housed in one location. Much like a food court but with more of the local flavor using designs on the tables, chairs and stalls that reflect local culture. We simply took in snacks of sparkling apple juice, Lotus paste bun and char siew bun.Hot food with cold drinks. Perfect way to end a busy day at nearby Sentosa
3
This very busy food court offers a variety of Asian kitchens from Singaporean, Thai, Indonesian, Indian, Chinese etc. Expect to find curries, rice toppings, stir fried vegetables and noodles, soup from mild to wild.Have been here many times and whatever we orderdoes not disappoint. We always get Laksa with milk Tea, Hainanese Chicken, Phas Thai and all sorts of rice toppings. Can be difficult to find a seat on weekends but it worth the wait:) Budget could be from 8-12 SGD per meal
4
These place has a variety of mouth-watering food for choice which makes it very hard to decide, if only I have more room in my stomach. Tried the Indonesian, 3 veg and a red curry chicken. Came to S$11, I am wondering if this is consider pricey as I have found other foodcourt dishes are usually cheaper in Singapore. This food court does have nice decor. I got there at 12pm and it was easy to find sittings but by 12.30 it's packed with lunchtime crowd workers
4
Always came here while visiting singapore, and order the same food over and over, chicken rice, wonton noodles and chin teng. Place near to resort world sentosa, place we used to stayed. Just 1 station by monorel. A lot of choices for singaporean or malaysian authentic food. Comfortable but will be crowded on the weekend will difficult to find table, and long Q for favorite food. Price is affordable singapore food court standard 5-10 SD. Love it
5
Located at Vivo City Food Republic is made up of various vendors freshly cooking the most delightful local dishes at more than reasonable prices. It is very busy but well organised with friendly staff constantly clearing tables for new patrons. A great place to sample local treats or literally stuff yourself. Yum
4
Hungry, then choose food republic with a varied range of cuisine. Get your chop sticks to the ready. Busy at lunch time so expect a bit of a wait, also the queues for the drinks are a bit too long so take some water!
4
I did not count the stalls but it was a tremendous occasion to see live food preparation and to taste all sorts of asian foods. I strongly recommend this food court. The antique atmosphere and decoration are really nice too.
4
This review is quite late. Food Republic Food Court is located inside the VivoCity. It houses scores of food stalls which serves almost all kinds of cuisine you can imagine.
4
Food courts in Singapore have no comparison to the franchise dominated tasteless food courts in North America. Excellent local flavours and variety. Plus inexpensive for a family to eat. Just watch out and don't take someone saved table as the locals like to use a small item like package is tissue to save their table. We had four different dishes and made our choice based on the length of the line which turned out to work well. The fruit drinks at the entrance of the food court were good as well as no added syrup was added.
5
If you've not been to a Food Republic before then you are going to love this - There are approximately 20 different kitchens each serving a different type of food - mainly asian. You can select Thai or Korean. Prices are super low - I think I paid $6 for a Green Curry and Rice - and its one of the best I have had in a long time
5
This food court has lots to choose from and all very economical. We tried a Thai chicken curry and some Korean Barbecue, both very good and good value. We love these food courts as an option for lunch. Plenty of variety and all at good prices
5
Unsure where to enjoy local Singaporean style cooking & want to have the convenience of choosing & tasting a large variety of local meals? Visit Food Republic at Orchard Rd Singapore. There are 2x Food Republic Food courts at Orchard Rd.One is so well decorated with individual country's theme (Malay, Indonesian, Thai, Cantonese....). The other centre is not as pleasing, but the meals are great value & spoiled with choices.We need a Food Republic centre inside a nice Westfield shopping centre in Sydney please!!! The Food Republic centre in Hong Kong is very average....
4
A late lunch for my family after visiting Sentosa. Hugh variety of loal food for you to chooses. My parents and sister ordered a Laksa and the soup base tasted good, with some crockle inside which they loved a lot, while my Prawn Noodle in Soup was average
4
Whether you're craving Ba Kuh Teh, Laksa or Chili Crab, Food Republic offers them all. It's still authentic as it gets but some how you lose that feeling of really being immersed in the street food culture scene. But in my personal opinion, they still get the job done by satisfying your street food cravings
4
Amongst the various food courts I have patronized, Food Republic is the best. I had nasi padang from Padang Delight and really enjoyed it. The tempeh was really good. They offered sambal belacan which really a kick to my rice. The entire place is clean, bright and spacious.
4
This was our lunch spot after our morning at Sentosa Island. I personally ate something very simple like spring rolls but my friend loves her asian food and ate like a queen!! Loads of choice... just nothing 'western'
2
A broad selection notwithstanding, I felt I had wandered into a robbers' den. The mixed food stall Jia Jia Le charges prices that are 3 times standard hawker fare prices. Left a very bad taste.
4
Just renovated few months ago. Varieties of food selection which able to cater for a family. But it was difficult to
1
Remember the first time we arrived in Vivo City, Food Republic Food court was where we had our lunch and dinner. Staying in Sentosa, this was a convenient place with a wide variety of choices. We loved the satay, the pita with curry, and too too cakes. This time return to the court, it was a total disappointment, the place was not clean, still crowded as before, but the worst is the food! The Bakuteh which was my favorite dish elsewhere, was extremely salty, did not, could not finish it. No more pita with curry found. A great disappointment
5
You need to walk through to see the vast range of food offered here. You will get lost trying to figure out what you want to eat and taste during any point of time. The range is so humongous that it will tire you trying to figure out what is best. You will get Indian Vegetarian food - Saravana Bhavan also here offering a wide range of Indian food. The service is very fast and offerings has good taste. Enjoy the best of wide range of Asian food here
4
We had spent all morning on Sentosa Island and by the time we got back to mainland Singapore we were more than ready for lunch. As we stepped off the train we spotted Food Republic on the same floor as the Sentosa Station.First of all we did a complete circuit checking out the offerings at all of the stalls, the majority of which specialize in one form of hawker food or another.We both ended up selecting ayam panggang, a spicy chicken leg on steamed rice, for a mere S$6. With a beer for me and a coconut juice for my friend the total bill came to S$23, unbeatable value.Food Republic's decor consists of chunky long wooden tables and stools, where we sat with other diners enjoying their lunch. Around the perimeter is a wall roughly thrown together with old doors and window frames. It creates a very funky atmosphere
3
After getting "lost" in the number of restaurants to choose from, I finally zeroed in on the Hainanese chicken at Sergeant's Chicken (sorry, if I got the name wrong). The chicken was not bad, but it's nothing to rave about. It's better compared to the Hainanese chicken I had at the food court on the upper floor of Bugis Junction mall.I loved that the place was vibrant - full of people and seeing senior ladies going around with the drink carts.I was looking forward to using my credit card at Food Republic - as I saw a tarpaulin by the entrance that advertised a particular credit/debit card with a promotion - S$1 off for a minimum purchase, S$6.50, if I recall correctly. The promotion was ongoing, but I was disappointed that practically all the stalls that I checked out (believe me, I checked out many) had signs that said that the promotion was all used up - strange considering that it was only a discount offer and not as if the promotion was for a limited stock item. The tarpaulin could be misconstrued as a piece of deceptive advertising - Food Republic should consider removing it
5
At first it's a bit daunting as this place is huge and packed, but take a few mins to fully immerse and it's worth it. So many traditional food stalls to choose from. The tell tale sign that the food is good was the amount of locals who pack this place out. There was at least 300 people in here and we loved it. Ok so we were the only foreigners and we loved it. Just point to a picture and they make it super fresh for you. Friday nights are the best
5
One of my best lunch meals was at the Food Republic in Vivo City, and the noodle soup I had was super delicious. I was just there on July 14, and it was awesome to go back to the place again. The first time I was there some years ago, it was difficult to get a table. It's still the same, and I don't mind. I love the thrill of having to wait just to have that one noodle soup favorite :
5
I love this place. It caters for large numbers of workers and shoppers in the area. It is made up of loads of stalls selling different foods. I've loved all that I tried especially the Indonesian BBQ. It just is happy in serving cheap and cheerful food and eat on the communal wooden chairs and benches. Fantastic prices. Just remember to bring or buy some napkins
4
As the name already refers it's a foodcourt. So lots of choice in different Asian food. Always busy place...
4
A great place to try out a wide variety of Asian dishes. Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Malay, Indonesian cuisines to spoil your taste for good food. Just be there early before lunch or dinner to be sure of seats.
4
I've been going to this Food Republic for many years and the food never disappoints. There you seat in communal tables in the center of a vast array of food stalls. Price is great, atmosphere is cool, there's A/C and the food is very tasty.
4
Located at Level 3 Vivocity, right next to Sentosa Express. The price is very reasonable with so many choices. I spend about 10-15SGD before each time to go to Sentosa.
4
The BBQ chicken wings is devine.
Also the korean food great
My wife and i go often
Been here for 4 years and this remains best food court
5
The best curried lamb I have had for years (twice) and my energy restored with the freshly squeezed sugar cane juice and soured plum, superb. There are just the right amount of stalls here with a varied choice and comfortable and clean surroundings. Friendly and helpful staff. Superb food and drinks. A great place to have a rest
4
A true sign of 'real' local food is the presence of 'natives'. Food Republic Food Courts are packed with locals and it can be extremely difficult to find a seat at peak mealtimes.All the Food Republic Foodcourts are clean, attractive and - most importantly in this hot, humid isle - air conditioned!Because of the aircon and the prime positions at / close to MRT stations, prices are a little higher than the non-airconditioned food courts a little bit further out. Despite this, the Food Republic Foodcourts are stlll cheap eats as the $1-3 premium per dish (higher as you edge closer to the CBD) over the standard $2.50-4 at suburban, non-aircon foodcourts will not break the bank
5
 This place is located in Shaw House opposite The Grand Hyatt in Scotts Road, down from where we were staying at the Goodwood Hotel. It was great for breakfast. We ordered eggs and toast and coffee at the Toast Box for about $7.00 There is a small but exclusive supermarket in the complex and it sells the most amazing pastries from Johan of Paris. We could purchase fantastic fruit and small gifts there and eat in the foodcourt itself. Dotted around was various different eating spots which we did try. Many locals ate there and it was always busy
1
For goodness sake, do NOT even think of eating here if you think it is some regular foodcourt. It is a cut-throat food court aimed at earning the tourist dollar.A economical rice stall can charge SGD15 for 2 veg, 1 meat and 1 fish. Honestly, this is ridiculous. Almost no stall sells anything below $7. And the food is NOTHING special for that kind of price. Crazy! I would happily spend my money on Carl's Junior
5
I invited my bestfriend to dine our lat the Food Republic for lunch in Vivo City. It's my third day visit in Singapore and I wanted to try the best foods I could eat for lunch. My bestfriend suggested that we should order Ho Kien Mie. I told her we should try different dishes. And because I'm craving for roasted duck, I ordered one for me. Actually, I did order a packed meal for only $15 SGD whicj is really good for sharing. There's a small plate for roast duck and rice, steamed green leafy bok-choy and wanton noodles. Not bad at all! I ordered 1 medium serving of Ho Kien Mie for $7 SGD for my bestfriend. All the foods we ordered were very tasty and delicious that's why we ordered another small serving of Ho Kien Mie for $5 SGD. If we were given a chance to rate the restaurants where we ordered these it would be 8 out of 10! Definitely, I will come back for more because there's a variety of food to choose from
4
Nice food court with plenty of options.. Tables are not very clean and we bring sanitisers to clean them up when we seat with the kids.. Prawn noodle are outstanding!!
5
I love this place. They have the variation of local and Asian cuisine. The price of these foods are affordable. I love the Korean and Malaysian food mostly.
3
There is a wide variety of food in Food Republic, located on the 3rd floor of Vivocity. I personally like the Hokkien Mee and the Ngoh Hiang Stall. The Downside is the food is overpriced and the portion are very small.
3
Nothing special...and not so variatif booth. But good for the ambience, since we can see the fountain of wealth from there. It was entertaining.
5
We stopped here for dinner after a day at Universal Studios. There was a lovely selection of food at great prices. The downside was that they did not sell Tiger beer. Had a clean modern look, but still had touches from the past.
4
Food Republic is a great way to find (almost) any kind of food or meal you want, Hongkong or here in Singapore, and the ambience is very nice.
3
The place has lot of Malaysian/Asian choices however I would want more Indian and Western outlets. After scavenging through the food stalls I found Mini Wok the most appropriate for satisfying hunger after an evening movie. I ordered cereal chicken rice which had a distinct flavour to it. Good place if you want to find many choices at one place if you can compromise on exquisiteness of the cuisines
4
After a great day at universal, popped in for a feed. Like most food republic areas, plenty to choose from. Had a ripper of a char keow teoh from the Malaysian stand. Had right balance of spice. Loved the cold kopi o from the beverage stand at the back
4
Firstly, it must be clarified that a Food Republic Foodcourt is not a restaurant but a collection of different food stalls in the one location. Food Republic Foodcourts are found all over Singapore and the ambience, variety and quality of food, and prices, vary from one Foodcourt to another. Note that at most of the stalls self- service is the order of the day.The latest Food Republic Foodcourt has just opened in the basement of Capitol Piazza at the junction of Stamford Road and North Bridge Road. It has the best ambience and arguably some of the best food stalls of all the Foodcourts in Singapre but expect to pay a little more also.We had Indonesian food at the Barabara stall which is an offshoot of Indochili Restaurant at Zion Road. If you love spicy food then we recommend this stall
5
let's say its just a foodcourt, but, its like a place of wonders..all your local favorites are here. My fave Hokkien prawn noodles,chicken wings, and a lot more..You should try all the famous local foods in Sg. That's one thing you'll surely dont want to miss.. Oh how i miss Sg so much.
3
A good enough food court, given the choice and convenience. Good for feeding after the morning rides at Sentosa and then go back for some more.
5
A must for all foodies. Try all oriental menu. Also has a south indian menu. Only cash payments and no cards. Will get crowded during peak times
4
A bit expensive compare to city price. A lot of choice! The ambiance is soo cool. like we're back to "Kampung" era . hahaha. Food is very good. This is a fast-phase food court, so you you'll get your food quickly. Let's eat!
5
I always order the dumpling on another stall and the beef brisket noodles on the other stall.
Everytime I'm in here, always going back to this food court.
4
Have snacked here many times..for lunch today I had dumplings with flat noodles and a pineapple juice...cost SD$8.60...not bad...can't remember the stall though.
The food hall is on level three...just near the monorail entrance.
5
I just stumbled on this place and thought I'd give it a try. It was outstanding. I had great Thai food, as well as a cool experience eating at one of a seemingly endless number of Asian food courts in Singapore. Definitely recommend this spot.
3
I stopped by this place when my group and I wanted to visit Sentosa. The place was crowded but the mall wasn't that nice I think. By the way, there're lots of foods you can choose at this place. I have to go around for few times after i finally decided to have kwetiau goreng. Taste not bad, quite ok for average dish
5
There are so many choices I had to do 2 laps and still could not decide!I finally settled on the duck char sui with rice and a side of broth. Delicious.All foods are on display and one can see how each of them is prepared. No hidden methods here. Some vendors allow you to choose the ingredients, then make your wet soup from your selection. The best way to build your own lunch.Best advice I can offer: arrive hungry
4
Fried Hokien Mee, Oyster Omelet and Coconut Rice Cake are must-haves. The food court serves a wide range of food for everyone's requirements. Difficult to find a seat during peak hours, especially during lunch and dinner (like everywhere else). Pricey but if you find the food you like, it's fine
1
2 years ago I been to this foodcourt and had a very bad experience. This time I gave it a try and again disappointed with the food. We ordered the Fish soup n Fish soup Mee Hoon, taste is below average, definitely not worth a try. Price is definitely on the high side. Will not visit again. Can get more tasty n cheaper food elsewhere.
4
We ordered nasi ayam. Good food. But we didnt eat there. We do take away. I rated 4 because the chicken portion is really small for $8 meal. But it is close to Bras Basah MRT and Next to Strand Hotel Bencoolen.
4
This is a must do with the abundance of food choices available. Go crazy here if you are a food who has a palette for world cuisine.
4
Before hopping sentosa express, we decided to stuff ourselves.. Quite some choices.. But we choose nasi lemak counter at the front side.. We can choose the dishes.. No need to wait for the cooking time. And it taste alright! Satisfied and ready to explore Sentosa!
2
i am a foodie! but being a mom tops everything and being a foodie sometimes just doesnt work with young kidsthis place has many MANY choices of food and just perfect to try different tastes and flavorsmy favorite was the indian corner and the vegetarian stall too.the dumplings and noodle soups of both the chinese and japanese stands looked amazing but to my disapointment were containing pork in all of their foods "for those who dont eat pork"but all in all the food is nice here but the atmosphere is LOUD during lunch timesso babies and young toddlers might not fit in here
4
There are plenty of local food here and provides a good introduction to South East Asian food for visitors. The locals come here and they have people selling drinks on trolleys going round so you don't have to leave your seat if you need to buy a drink. It always gets very crowded and busy here but this is the place to enjoy the atmosphere. The food prices are very reasonable and the quality is consistent
4
As it is a foodcourt, of course you will have lots of choice for food. But be careful for some food is kinda pricy and not worth it. I have the braised pork (Quan Xuang Yuan rest.) and a noodle. They actually nice, and fit the portion too plus the price is still okay
3
A large range of food. Good value for money Japanese called Goen with great tonkatsu curry rice at a very reasonable price. My boys n husband love it. I like their salmon do biro which is great too. However the fried dough fritter stall has bad, cold fritters n lazy staff that will not help their boss to create business. The fried fritter which is my favourite could not be eaten. It's cold n rubbery...yucks! I just could not eat it. The Yong tau foo stall- soup is super salty n the items very pricey. Too much msg in their food.
4
Hawker center themed food court in the VivoCity shopping mall. The design is inspired by traditional outdoors hawker centers, which makes the place cuter and more fun than the usual mall food courts.Same as the real hawker cents, you pick your food at one stall and your drinks at another and then find a seat. All the usual (Asian) hawker food is available and of good quality.The tone is a little rough and the English of the hawkers is not always good, but you get along
4
The prices may be a dollar or so higher than outside centres but it's well worth it. There's plenty of food choices and you just sit at a bench table amongst everyone else. Typically you buy your food and drinks from separate vendors but none seem to supply napkins so try and bring your own especially if you are a "tuck right in"eater like me. We went there almost every day for lunch. Very popular
5
We ate in food republic food court in Wisma Atria, Vivo City and City Square Mall. There are a lot of choices, range from Indian food to Indonesian food. The price range was between 5 SGD to 12 SGD. The food appearance was 95% same as the picture. The food was very higiene. If you go to Singapore with your family,it's so comfort to eat there since each member of the family can decide what he want to eat.
4
I saw this food court while I was at Vivo shopping center. I didn't try the food but it looks interesting. Asian food with nice display and organized sitting area. Try the Juice at the juice booth at the entrance.
3
Standart Food court in Vivo City Mall Singapore, a lot of food like Steamboat, Chicken Rice, Lo Mie etc. Standart food for lunch after visit Universal Studio and Sentosa Island.
5
they serve me very big size foood. recommended for hungry people... lol. i like the fish katsu curry rice ... cheap eats with just $6.90.
4
this food republic stands out for its old fashioned dÃ©cor, gives you the feeling that you are eating out on the street. We stopped here for a quick lunch before going to Universal Studios and the stalls were overwhelming, we almost wasted an hour just going around. But we made the right choice in choosing the stall selling grilled chicken and seafood served with rice bathed in special curry sauce. I cannot recall the name of the stall but the food is worth the money around $6-12. Even though we went there during the weekend lunch time, we were able to get some seats (for 2 pax) immediately.

Been in Singapore several times and this chain of foodcourt could meet your Indonesian tastes. You may find Java Kitchen, Indonesian Riverside Barbeque, Pontian Noodle, Nasi padang.... and I guess Nasi Lemak could kill your hunger too with its special sambal or chilli.Although it is a little bit more expensive than ordinary or regular foodcourt but for Indonesian this is a small heaven
4
Hawker centre style foodcourt, but more up-market to cater to the shopping crowds on Orchard Road. Great variety of food and cuisines, and many places cook to order. The prices are a little higher than your standard hawker centre fare but still great value. Well worth a visit.

We came here for a quick lunch today after having spent the morning over at Universal Studios. As usual, Vivocity was hugely crowded with people and, not surprisingly, so was Food Republic at around 12.30pm. WIth some effort we were able to find a table, and then obtain some food. Prices are certainly higher than in local hawker centres, but then quality is probably also slightly better and cleanliness is definitely better
4
I visited another branch which is on Orchard next to ION.So many to eat! You can enjoy not only Singapore food but also Western, Japanese, Korean cuisines in one place. But they don't have Chicken rice shop which made me disappointed. I love oyster omelet and hokken mee. Food republic is everywhere around the big city in Singapore. Compare with the hawker center, the price is much higher but not too expensive.

Visited on 18thAug15 w family. Tried the Yafu Kitchen, sell food like Zi Char. Ordered San Lor Hor Fun(white) w fish slices $6.30 n Cereal chicken w rice $6.80. Food taste average. Ordered Ice Kacang $2.80 n Water Chestnut drink $2.20 from Ice Shop. Find that a bit pricey as Char Siew rice almost $7 but food taste average.

We went here on our first night in Singapore with our two children (7&5). We had them all primed to try different foods they hadn't tried before. The place was heaving, we eventually got something for the kids, then had to buy a drink at another stall. Trawled round for ages to find a seat. My son then spotted a rat behind me. I played it down, but then it came out again and came nearer, so we got up and moved. By now not even hungry we found another table with difficulty, to then be thrown out as we weren't eating food from that place's stall. Eventually got a seat where we ate little and left quickly. Never again, and unfortunately didn't encourage our kids to be adventurous with the food here
5
the food republic at Vivo Vivo was great value for money, open flame cooking at it's best, culture after culture and for less than $10 a terrific fresh meal, very nice staff and a vibrant place.
4
We love that this place is very close to the mall and Sentosa. There are varieties of food to choose from. My family and I will be in Sg next month and I'll definitely bring them here again after our visit to Universal Studios.
4
Reasonable prices and many choices. Japanese food was specially my favourite but lot of good choices available. Athmosphere is also nice with wooden tables and door decorations.
4
You can choose from dishes from local hawker stalls, but they are a bit more expensive. We had dinner on our way back from Sentosa. Very convenient after a day of sightseeing.
5
I like the food options and the variety of different types of food served fresh. It seems that locals were also enjoying the variety.
3
If you want to taste SE Asian food IN ONE PLACE, this is the place to choose from.Meals are mostly in set but also may be ordered by single ones.Tastes are okay, not much to be surprised of. I will be here for convenience only. If I want cheaper and better one, I'll go Bugis and Newton or Albert centres
3
An impressively diverse and sizeable range of traditional Asian cuisines on offer here. Very busy and was not easy to find a seat to eat at. Food was good, reasonable sized servings at very good prices. For a first time visitor the range of choice could be somewhat overwhelming, so take time to have a good look at all that is on offer
5
I really speechless for food here. Because, every foods here is really delicious. Especially for Korean , Japanese , Indonesian , and Singaporean Cuisine. Everyone must try this Restaurant if you go to singapore! I will go to singapore shortly and I'm sure I will not miss this
5
What stands out is that this food-court has its own unique feel. Never mind that it is a recreated village feel with the recreated village stalls for a smorgasbord of street food. . Where else can i find such ambience in air-conditioned comfort? I am a tourist but I dont consider this a tourist trap as the prices are reasonable and you eat what you choose. Whilst there is possibly better local food elsewhere, this spot is most convenient within the Vivo Mall. The place was remarkably congested when I was there with predominantly locals it seems to be. On the left as one enters the food court, one sees a whole range of pre-cooked local dishes. Then there are the vendors with their carts of food and drinks. Also stalls where the food is being cooked. Fully recommend a visit. If you like what I've shared, do click yes or is it like? Thakns
2
If you want good local food, go elsewhere. I travel to Singapore to visit family every 3-5 years and am always ready to enjoy the delicious local fare. First off, the food court is really nicely done, I really loved the set up. Unfortunately, the food did not hit the spot. Overpriced and not well cooked. The Singapore carrot cake was soupy, and mostly egg instead of daikon. Greatly disappointed especially when I saw that they had won an award. The chicken rice was ok, nothing extraordinary. save your money and eat elsewhere, there are so many options in Singapore that this one isn't worth trying
5
This is the food court of the vivo mall, decorated like a typical hawkers center. The food is great and super affordable. The kum pao chicken is the best that i had. Must eat when in Singapore
4
Had breakfast here before start of shopping at vivo city mall
It's decorated like a typical.hawler stall setting with old fashion decor
Food is good and the coffee is one of the best I have had
4
The food is good and nice place where you can meet with members of the family for a nice chit chat. Lots of food choices and spacious place.
5
you will have a huge number of choices for Asian food there, stalls, pavillions, small restaurants, all of them offering you delicious traditional cuisine. Do not go if you are very hungry, because you might want to try everything!
4
Incredible range of food available at very reasonable prices. Avoiding taxes and service charges in food court makes for cheap dining. Worth a visit.
5
We went here for lunch with my daughter and two grandchildren when shopping a Vivo City.Ironically, it was our first taste of this style of eating in Singapore and as it transpired it turned out to be the best of the lot. We thought it beat the 'Hawker' style of the more noted places - whilst offering a huge variety of foods.Obviously hugely popular with the locals as it was packed and hard to get seating - but worth the wait.Well worth the visit
5
We came here for a late lunch after a visit to Sentosa Island. Little did we know that we are going to be so spoilt for choices! This is kind of a food court which has a wide variety of stalls and open seating area in the middle. It was crowded but well maintained. We had grilled chicken and rice from an Indonesian place and also Tu Tu coconut cakes from one of the other stalls. Both of them were delicious. And for the Indian tourists in Singapore who are yearning for some authentic Indian food, they have a Saravana Bhavan too ! :-
4
This place is brilliant! So many possibilities for lunch or dinner. We went back twice! A great alternative to eating on Sentosa as you can get the Sentosa Express monorail for free( however you do have a SG$4 for the trip back to Sentosa!) and eat relatively cheaply and with a great selection of local and international food. I discovered the 'POPIAH' pancake which is an unusual mix of egg peanut and stewed vegetables, wrapped in a paper thin pancake! It sounds like a very unlikely combination but absolutely delicious and if my memory serves me correctly it was about SG$2.50! The BBQ chicken wings from the same stall were also the best I've had in Singapore - succulent! For desert we couldn't get enough of the 'Tu tu Coconut Cakes' which were made by a lovely lady who worked all day NON-STOP crafting these morsels of sweet tender cake. They are steamed and filled with sweetened coconut or ground peanuts!!! You can't stop at one! She makes them to order and although the queue is long, watching her make them is so interesting.Look out for her cart towards the rear of the food hall - a must
4
A very busy food court with endless crowds both from the offices and shops around that area and also tourists. I had the traditional "home cooked" food of Szechuan hot and spicy soup which reminded me of my late mum's fantastic cooking. Had some dessert too which was very nice, not too sweet. They are quite expensive for small portion but it taste really good so its fair.Would recommend the food there as there are great varieties and some look really nice. Only problem is getting a seat as its very crowded especially during lunch time
5
There was an amazing variety of food on offer, the nasi lemak was so great I took some away when we returned to Hong Kong. There was a great fish soup noodle, my big son was addicted to the buk kut teh. Also, the price is reasonable. No point paying more for inferior tasting food. In comparison, Malaysian Food Court in Waterfront near Universal Studios promised much but was very very disappointing, each restaurant had a average menu of two dishes only, no variety, no choice and I could not find appropriate food for children there. So stick with Food Republic Foodcourt!
4
Soooo many variety of food. It give me choices for halal food.
Meat, chicken, noodle, rice, bread...just name what you looking for. Seems like you swims in a big food pool. Delicioso...
5
Amazing range of food choices, always stop there when I'm at vivo city and very cheap too very delicious and high hygiene standards
5
We love eating here, as there is something for everyone, the quality is high, and the favour fantastic. We wish we could take it with us.
5
if you don't want a restaurant, No problem! Eat at the food court. Here there are alot of food variouty that you can choose from. I will surely come back here.
5
Everytime we visit Singapore, we never miss to eat at Food Republic in Vivo City. We always come back to ear Nase Lemak, Hainese Chicken, Chicken Wings, Fishball Noodles and drink Barley and Jasmine Cold drinks among others. There are a lot of drinks, desserts and foods to choice from as stalls offering different authentic dishes or cuisine are being offered in this place. When you're inside Food Republic, somehow you will feel the strong Chinese cultural influence because of the place design and decorations. It would have been much better if the place would allow people to take photos while dining or experiencing their food especially for foreign visitors like us. Cameras and taking of photos are forbidden in this place so watch out!
4
With plenty of choices, it makes one indecisive of what to order (because you want almost everything there). We ordered a few dishes and shared. The beef noodles was surprisingly good, and the wanton soup noodles. The kimchi fried rice was a disappointment though. Overall it's a good place with variety of choices. For drinks, you have to try the chestnut drink for $2.40. It's awesome I promise
4
This place is always crowded because of the traffic in/out Sentosa and the mall visitors itself. Lots of food varieties, even some Indonesian brand such as Java Kitchen. I tried Satay with Popiah and my wife had a traditional rojak. Sergeant chicken rice also something recommended here. Just be patient to get a seat, enjoy peolle watching and after that unwind at the rooftop park-same floor as the Food Republic itself
4
The food Republic at Vivo City is a great place for a variety of different food. Before you order, walk around and have a good look at the many possibilities, this because you might change your mind and choose something different than you came for. I went here as an individual as well as with groups of 30-50 people. Their big tables accommodate the fellowship you want to have with your friends. It is also fun to engage one of their dish cleaners into a conversation, they appreciated a compliment too
4
Great place to be in...lots of verity lots of choice.. yummy food.. initially felt it unhealthy but when you are having out once in a while then its amazing... few counters help you get what you want like prepare dishes without seafood or only with chicken or may be vegetables.. Be careful while choosing dumplings etc as most them are beef and pork.. just in case you dont eat them.. request them for vegetarian dishes and they'll prepare for you.Nice timepass place to be in.. would definitely recommend this place for a group of pple or few.. worth it...not very expensive
4
I can say that from the title of the review itself, the food court is pretty damn good. The food court has pretty much a multi-cultural selection of food. I spent a great deal there just for lunch and dinner. Especially in Vivo City and Takashimaya. The food is awesome and the prices are cheap... hahaha I gained 10 lbs just by going there. If you get a chance, go to the food court after a long day. Its worth it. Plus, its self serve. You basically buy the food, you wait for it, then they will give it to you in a tray. You have the option of picking the utensils you want to use and the seating is well... sit anywhere you find is empty. Because once 4 pm hits, the seating is gonna be hard to find
5
This Food-Court is extremely clean.There are many different types of food stalls with a variety of dishes that can be found in this food-court.It's a best place to eat.
This food-court is almost present in every malls.
4
Lots of different food types to choose from all very good quality and freshness. Only issue can be finding a table so suggest get one before you order
5
Clean and uniquely designed place matched with a lot of stores selling authentic Singaporean foods and some foreign dishes as well.
4
A variety of food stalls raining from Thai, to Korean, to Chinese. Most dishes are between 6 and 10 sing. Can be very hard to find a place to sit between 12 and 115 so go early or later. It is on the top floor of Vivo next near the monorail terminal.
5
The hawkers stalls are a welcome change from the expensive restaurants. We visited Food Republic at the Sentosa Harbourfront, located in the Vivo City.Here you can choose and eat from a variety of Asian cuisines and consume in a communal seating area.Very clean, affordable and a great atmosphere. Definitely recommended
5
I have no idea where I ate in these hawker markets or how I even decided where to eat for that matter but wow, I'm glad I did! The smells and atmosphere were wonderful. My daughter had a noodle dish and I had crispy duck and rice. It cost us less than A$10 for both. Will be returning here on my next visit for sure
5
A recreation of a tatty 1950s hawker market in a gleaming air-conditioned shopping mall. Only in Singapore! The atmosphere is great and as long as you are happy with a chaotic busy noisy space where you spend as much time cruising the stalls as eating the food then this will is reallyu fun. The food is good and there is a hugechoice. We had some wonderful jade noodle soup, seafood dumplings, anchovies and peanuts, Indonesian rice and fish and much more decide. With most dishes in the $6- $8 range you can't go too far wrong. Also it seemed friendlier thatn some of the other hawker markets we went to
4
The first thing we noticed was the aroma, and that is what lured us to this eatery. I had the laksa, a spicy noodle soup. My wife had a big spring roll. We were both full and satisfied and spent less than $10. I'd definitely go there again. It's also fun watching the cooks and how efficiently they prepare the meals
5
Only the best hawkers are found in Food Republic, and because of that, along with their locations and hygiene standard, you will find the food to be a bit more expensive than the HDB flat foodcourts. However it is worth paying a little bit extra for guaranteed great food! You can order most meals in 3 sizes ranging from about S$4-7. My favourites are Hokkien Mee, Kway Teow, and Laksa. Of the 5 Food Republics I have visited I think Vivo City and Orchard Rd (313 & ION) are the best due to their size and therefore number of vendors and tables
5
We went there with a group of 60 people. The fun part was, we all found tables to eat in groups together and each on was able to find food according to her/his taste. Being people coming from seven different countries this was not an easy task. But most of us were happy with the food they could choose from. It is just great to have a place where you can go with big groups and eat for a decent price with high quality food of diverse cultures and backgrounds. We will be there again
4
Myriad choices, oriental dishes in store, affordable, with a lot of chairs and tables available. (visited in March 2013)
4
i like noodle beef here. It was very delicous and their services were good. I will come back Vivo to eat
1
I have never received such am appalling type of service before, especially from the Hot Cold drink store. When we asked for a simple drink like Soy Bean, the lady just said 'no' repeated number of times. They really need to improve her vocabulary.
4
various options of food from different cultures. quite affordable, and as usual large portion for non-singaporean. nice place to hang out and have a long chat.
5
Since I first started visiting Singapore in 2009, I have made sure that I am around this food hall at lunch time whenever possible. The selection of food is great, the prices are a bargain, and the atmosphere is quite unique. The whole place has been done up to look like Old Singapore and its hawker stalls. Ok - you may find yourself sharing a table with others, but this just adds to the atmosphere.Choose from Indian, Chinese, Malay, Thai, Japanese, Western - and of course, traditional Singaporean favourites. Find a table, buy your food, and soak up the atmosphere. There are not many places in the world I would go out of my way to visit, but this is one I keep coming back to. Highly recommended
4
Right next to the Sentosa Express terminal at Vivo city, Food Republic is a shopping mall food hall, but not like one I've ever seen. Firstly, it's themed like a hawker market with 'antique' furniture, mood lighting, and even carts coming around selling drinks. Many cuisines and favourite dishes of Asia are represented here, from 'build-your-own' Nasi Lemak and Indonesian bbq meals, to Indian curries, a variety of Japanese stalls, Chinese roast meats and soups, and many many more. My son and I enjoyed a couple of BBQ Pork buns (a bargain 2 for $2), some curry puffs and lime juice. My husband was not as impressed with his Indonesian 'scissor cut' set meal, although it was good value at $6.50, the meat was a bit fatty for his palate. Overall, it was a welcome relief for the wallet and a delicious treat in a relaxed atmosphere. Open for lunch and dinner, and there is a Kaya Toast cafe attached, which is open earlier breakfast
5
Multi national dishes on offer and I chose Indian. The food was excellent the chef friendly and helpful despite many questions from me. The only hassle I had was finding a table to eat....it's the Singapore way or no way and that is to leave something (anything) on the table and then go off in search of food. I took my drink from the fruit juice stall apple & carrot which was so refreshing and complimented the Indian food all for less than 15$. Will definitely eat here again
1
Actually the food are very good, but the people there (the chicken rice stall owner and the cleaning lady) are terribly not nice. My wife was try to help to clean the table since the cleaning lady was very slow, but the lady yelled and said not nice things to my wife
4
Located at Vivo Mall,,,this is where everyone eats,,, Third Floor,, many great selections and at affordable prices,, the food is prepared well and tastes great! of all the tourist spots,, this is the one you can count on for good food and at affordable prices,, perhaps 10 dollars each,, not more,,
4
Perfectly located at the entrance of the Sentosa express, this place has plenty of options. While none of the establishments are exceptional, the food is above average for mall fare, and the prices are fair. The place is very popular, so hold a table if you are in a group.
4
Everything under one roof. We had some dimsum and local drinks plus desserts. I love the concept of dining cheap but without the cheap fast food ambiance.
Always busy.
1
We went to pizza / pasta area of food republic, and after 6 days in Singapore this was by far the worst food we have had. We had a pizza and a steak - did not finish either. Would not recommend.
5
this place was a little gem. they had everything and very very cheap. to eat on the island could be expensive but this place was certainly value for money. fresh juices, fruit, rice dishes, noodles, deserts and more.
3
Some outlets serve reasonably good food. I liked the one in Vivo City though there is always a lack of place to sit during peak time.
4
always crowd of people in every hour, so hard to get seats.
many kinds of good food, in average price. nice place to eat with family.
4
Food republic provides, a wide selection of good food in a reasonable price, every single food there were greatt. We were confused to pick the food we want haha... to many good food, at last We had a tasty nasi lemak and pork rice. Nasi Lemak we had had some delicious sidedish, such as deep fried chicken, curry, potato, etc. The pork rice also nice, great famous tender pork meat with deep crispy pork skin, were rich of flavour, for sure we will be back soon to try other food there
4
Sooo much food to choose form that one can walk around and around and still not decide on what to eat! Lots to choose from, freshly cooked and great prices. Lots of seating and tables are cleaned quickly by staff. Great place to eat and get away from the heat
4
The Food Republic at Parkway is great. We have been there a few times now and every time we try the rojak and popiah. My parents who do not eat out to much also enjoyed these dishes. And we tried pepper chicken at pepper express which was very good. The prices are slightly on the higher side but are made up by good food. Try reaching there a little early as it gets very busy during weekends. The lines are very long and seating will be difficult to find if you go there at peak period
4
My husband and I came here with 2 friends for quite 20 to 30 minutes dinner before catching a 6:50 p.m. movie. We ended up in the Indian stall. Their serving of the Nan bread is quite small, though the quantity they gave us was a lot. The lamb sausage was also not bad. So was the chicken, and mutton etc. The price of the food was reasonable. The only complaint that I had is that the cooking time was rather long, and you need to keep on chasing the cook to prepare and cook your food. Other than that, not bad experience at all
5
Great choice of foods. I decided to try a food I knew nothing about and went to the Java counter. I asked the lady to decide for me what to eat and she put together a nice plate of a few foods which cost S$8. It was all great
