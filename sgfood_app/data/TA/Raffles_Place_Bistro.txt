The bolognese pasta is the best i've ever tried, as well as the chicken wings and their pizza selections. Cozy al fresco ambiance, over-looking the grand Marina Bay Sands. Indeed, a perfect ending to a busy work day!

Really close to the Ascott hotel. This dinner was reasonably priced and delicious. We ordered 5 meals and appetizers, prompt meal delivery and cooked perfect.

Foods are okay: nasi goreng, satay, sea foods, noodles. The environment is cozy and relaxing, with a nice view of beach with yachts. Price is quite expensive, but it is worth for this kind of restaurant.

Just on the street under the busy commercial Raffles Place, here you get a cheerful beer and samosa from the happy servers. Just away from the more busy bars and cafes associated with the business district but a hidden gem
