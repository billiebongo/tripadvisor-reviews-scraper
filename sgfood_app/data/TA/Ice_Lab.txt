It was really amazing and we had so much fun. It was so sweet and the taste is so amazing. I will definitely come back.

Tried this Korean dessert for the first time. Bingsoo! Shaved flavoured ice with Oreo. Many other flavours are available like green tea, mango etc. Portions are large and typically one is enough to be shared by 3 people.

This Ice Lab is different from the othe ice labs I've been to. Try the mango/banana and the strawberry shortcake Bingsoo. They're not too sweet, instead they're rich in fruits and shaved ice. Hope to come back and try their other flavors! ðŸ˜Š

Sometimes I really crave for bingsoo. But the prices in Singapore is over the TOP. Too much. Ok bingsoo for not so ok price.

That is from Korea and all of Korea style. Place is in center of Orchard road, easy to find. So crowded young people come there. And it has good patbingsu sweet ice, so sweet, so delicious what i tried. It's the best.

Iâ€™m a huge fan of snow ice and Ice Lab does not disappoint. I had the mango ice which was fantastic. However, the shop had a very strong pungent smell to it and I had to ask to sit outside on the concrete wall because the smell was so nauseating I couldnâ€™t stand it. If they cleaned up a bit and fixed the smell I would rate this much higher.

After dinner we thought of having desserts and searched online, then this Korean Bingsu shop popped up. My friend is thinking it is probably healthier to have bingsu compare to others. I talk about the food first. I got the coffee Bingsu which costed me $20.9. I know picture is always for illustration but quite different when it presented. Taste wise nothing special. Bingsu itself tasted average. The decoration items are all cheapo. The ice cream not sure why there is ice inside, the ice that you normally have for your cold drink. The rocher chocolate( donâ€™t think is real rocher)like stuff tasted quite funny, a bit like expired and taste oily. The rest I just give up. I got a green tea lava, however, I am not aware that Collection point is different from Bingsu but the caisher din tell me that. By the time I collect Bingsu, I only realized this. So my lava is kind of cold. Initially i am hopping that it is outside for not that long. Taste wise is ok. Environment is really noisy!! They served us to a table, when sit down I saw an army of ants like crossing bridge and passed by us. My friends just feel disgusting to see all these

This is really one of the better bingsus in town and received the Korean wifeâ€™s mark of approval as the softness and fineness of the ice is closer to what you get back in Korea. The lemon bingsu was really refreshing. The coffee bingsu looked really good as well with so many goodies thrown into it

I love everything that involves shaved ice and mangos; be it japanese kakigori, taiwanese shaved ice or korean bingsu. Icelab offers one of the best bingsu's i have ever had. The place can get pretty busy but the staff does a great job in trying to accommodate everybody. If you love ice cream and/or shaved ice, this is the place to go

I'm a big fan of bingsu and I love to visit different bingsu cafes to try out. I went to the bugis outlet. I think this is one of the best bingsu in Singapore. However, my children did not like it. I guess because of the Yogurt flavour. The cashier recommended Yogurt bingsu which I don't think I like sour stuff but bought it since it's bestseller and it comes with strawberries and corn flakes. Big mistake. Bingsu was nice but Yogurt was not our type. Price is not cheap but you can pay with credit card. Ambience is good. I went on a Thursday evening at 6pm and there was no crowd. I would love to revisit and try our flavours
2
I visited the outlet in Bugis. For some reason, the male staff did not speak a single word to me throughout the entire order taking and transaction. The bingsu itself was average, and very much overpriced. Ranges from 13 - 20 dollars.
4
I always love plain original bingsu and they have one the best. I like how the serve the red bean and milk on the side rather than mixing everything because I don't like red beans. I wish the staff were more enthusiastic and friendly.
3
I'm no bingsu expert, so the bingsu I tried was satisfactory to me. My only peeve was the really high cost - 16.90 for a bowl of bingsu. And I do not feel it is worth the price even though it tastes decent.
5
Never tried bingsu before, but I'm totally sold. The strawberry one was delicious! We're defo going back to try the other flavours.
It's bloody expensive though - S$17.9 each.
Melt in the mouth stuff, no pun intended.

Try the Ice Lab at Orchardgateway at Somerset 313 as it is quite busy. The Mango Bingsoo was quite soft a day delicious.
There are ice flakes coming down from the ceiling which is quite different and unexpected which gives the place some atmosphere.
4
Pros- Nice menu selection, good enough to keep the kids and mum/dad happy- Nice touch with the bear and shaved ice at the center, a hit with the kidsCons- Bland interior, although the SG abstract on the wall is a nice touc

Their Oreo Bingsoo/Bingsu comes with shaved ice topped with oreo shavings, and an oreo on top of whipped cream. The ice is quite finely shaven and it tastes great. The only issue I have is the price. It is definitely more expensive compared to other bingsu places. The interior of Ice Lab is very clean, white and spacious. Nice place to sit down and chill
5
Omg I have never seen this before and was delighted to try it. It was a bit pricey but well worth it. The flakes of vanilla milk shavings melt in your mouth with a delicious combination of flavours to choose from. I had strawberry and it was awesome.

Walked by with my in-laws and decided to give this place a shot. Ice desserts were ok. Not memorable. And way overpriced. The bread thing was ok.But the reason I am writing this is this coffee they have called Da Bang coffee my wife ordered. It is an absolute joke. First, it's 3-in-1 super diluted and sugary coffee. Worse, they don't give you the whole pack. They add so little and add a bit of water to make it look like an espresso portion. I asked the staff and they admitted as much. So whatever you do, don't order Da Bang. It's a fancy name for a third of a 3-in-1 coffee in small quantity. Never again. Will be happy to see this joint fade off the face of Orchard Road

Went to their Bugis outlet where they have an amazingly stupid rule that the small size desserts were only to be eaten as take-always. We ordered two (spending as much as a full size) but were asked to leave when we sat down. The cups they serve them in are not designed to be eaten in Singapore heat and would melt away in the first five minutes. Admittedly they did have a little (very unprofessional) handwritten sign on the menu, but we didn't think they were serious- especially as there were many empty seats. Doesn't management (who I imagine dreamed up this nonsense) want their customers to enjoy their product?With many alternatives (who have much faster service) why would anyone go back. What a silly way to destroy a customer's experience. Lift your game management and stop asking your poor staff to apply stupid rules

This was a very nice and friendly place to eat at. The chocolate bingsu is a must try, the mango was slightly disappointing compared to the Australian bingsus
5
Festive season of December Singapore is a great location to be and best is the Orchard street ...and perfectly located is Ice lab with it delicious flavors of Bingsu. Kids had a blast and very friendly staff.
4
Delicious desert-- very unique. Refreshing, tasty... great creative options... will definitely be back
3
Definitely not a good dessert for the $15.90 paid. Rather eat a normal bingsu which is cheaper and nicer. Too much milk and not much toppings. Won recommend to friends
5
All the selections of korean BINGSO are all nice. My favourites are the lemon, strawberry, chocolate. It's quite a light desert contrary to the size of the servings. They aren't cheap like $16 each but each BINGSO can share between 2 adults or 3 kids.Located in the hip and happening Somerset. It's the perfect treat in between shopping hard and eating. Highly recommend
2
I absolutely love the Bingsu here and will drop in during non busy periods. Took my parents and children this time around and had to use the toilet. It was a disgrace, there was wet toilet paper all over the placr and urine all over the floor. Absolutely disgusting, if your general hygiene is that bad and neglected I would say that would include other areas of your establishment. Will not be back ever again until you clean your act up
3
agree with Alice T review - who said it's expensive, too much milk and won't recommend to friends.So we went, shared 2 - strawberry and another. Definitely not for lactose intolerant.Yes, the ice is very fine and of good quality so I guess you're paying for location
5
cool ambiance and delicious korean-style shaved ice desserts - superb flavors! this is not the shaved ice you are used to in the usa, remarkably different. the shaved-ice is soft and fluffy, the toppings are naturally flavorful and intense, the sweetness factor is less than expected. refreshing, with interesting recipes and choices. great place for dates, with the kids or simply to have a unique and different food experience. 3-4 people can share a single bowl, though you might want to try a few flavor-sets
5
Great selection of unique ice creations (Bingsu). Generous quantities and friendly service. Very clean and neat ambiance with a snow making machine that created falling snow in the middle of a round table on a polar bear- Kids loved catching the snow flakes and of course eating it :-). Take your appetite with you as the servings are huge- at least ours were :-)Depending on time of day there could be a bit of a queue- nothing the friendly staff cant handle.A nice way to end your day and enjoy a stroll on Orchard Road to walk it all off ;-)Cheers,Pinto's - N

Between 313 Somerset and Orchard Central shopping mall located at street level you'll find the Ice Lab or aka Korean Bingsu. The portions are on the generous size so you'll find people sharing. Not quite sure why shaved ice desserts have taken off but must admit after a days shopping it's nice and refreshing. You place your order and given a buzzer which will ring when your chosen dessert is ready
5
The Bingsoo is very delicious!!!!! I like the mango bingsoo!!! You can buy 1 portion for 2 people!!! Free mineral water
5
Come here because we saw a lot of people ate in their cafeðŸ˜œ
quite pricey bingsoo..
my fave is their soya bean bingsoo..
Topped with red bean mochi, pumpkin seed and also served with red bean paste.

Went there for dessert after dinner. Ordered a milk bingsu and a yogurt bingsu. When one scoops up the ice, it was so soft and fine. The milk supplemented the plain bingsu with red bean mochi. The other bingsu was decorated with strawberries, cornflakes and berries. The place was crowded with many young folks and teenagers. Snow flakes fall from the ceiling into the center of a round table and the mascot of the restaurant

The location is fab just near Orchard central . The ambience is lovely as well.They've got all their options pre plated and gives you an exact visual of what your dish will look like.The tastes were very refreshing and it's such a change from the usual Haagen Dazs and Ben and jerrys kind of concept.The only downside was that the bananas didn't look fresh and neither did the strawberries and we had to return one of our dishes as the bananas were black on the side. While they didn't fuss about changing much, they weren't the verily receptive about the idea as well although the spoilt bananas were blatantly staring at them in the face. Worth a visit for sure

Overall the portion didnâ€™t really wow us and it didnâ€™t taste as WOW as we thought it would be. I think I would go for my Mango ice which at most cost me $8 with generous serving of mango and topped with a mango ice cream.Though this is one expensive dessert, there is still itâ€™s unique charm that will make people pay willingly for it. Since there are so many different bingsu stores around in Singapore now, I share go find that perfect one that is reasonably price and taste good
5
Despite being our first time trying bingsu, we absolutely fell in love with this cold treat. The cafe offers a very quick service and a good selection of flavors of this dessert. We had no clue that the size of one bingsu would be enough for four of us! But, man, it was something! We tried frozen yogurt with cereal, green tea and mango. The most exciting part of the green tea bingsu is that under those fluffy and smooth (seems like never-melting) shavings there is an ice cream with beans! After enjoying and stuffing ourselves with this yummy dessert, we felt so cold in the airconed cafe that we had to rush out to warm up in a very contrasting weather
5
Ordered the Green Tea bingsu which arrived with jelly nestled on a mountain of shaved ice. The surprise was at the bottom with green tea ice cream and azuki beans! Didn't expect it to be at the base hence it would be better to eat fast before it melted.The ice flake was very soft and fluffy
2
All about ice and ice, a bowl of bingsu is enough for 3 friends to share, if u r a single diner , u may not complete them allWe ordered its matccha (green tea) cake for a try, sadly it has no Japanese green tea flavour at allBe prepared for long queue if u r going there after 9pm on a weekend/PH timingThe bear in the restaurant is cute as it churn out "snow" flake

As you know the craze for Bingsu in Singapore hasn't gone down, I tried many Bingsu from different Bingsu Restaurants and I dare to say Ice Lab has the best Bingsu so far! I tried the traditional option of Injeolmi Bingsu. The milk ice shavings does not melt even after I finished my last mouth. The red bean rice cake decorated at the top is not too sweet and is chewy. What's best about this place is that there is free flow plain water and a toilet within the restaurant! Kudos to the design of the restaurant where there is a sculpture of a bear trying to lick the ice falling from a revolving machine located on the ceiling above the bear

It wasn't first time to try bingsoo and I found it delicious. We ordered the chocolate one and shared between two. It's a big serving. The ice is like snow, soft and delicate and melts in your mouth. The chocolate topping added just the right amount of flavour. Yummy
