Had the lunch set with the egg, my 7 yo daughter loved the rice so much I had to buy her another plate of rice ($1.00)....

Paid a premium on Chinese New Year which I didn't mind too much. $19.20 (usually $3-5 at any hawkers market) what I did mind was everything was cold. Chicken, rice & veg. First & last time eating there.

Came here for lunch one day, get the $7 set which includes the fragrant rice with chicken and a side of soup too. Rich with flavour - the upscale version of delicious comfort hawkers food

Sergeant’s special included chicken, chicken rice, book chop, soup - all delicious for 7.50 SGD. This stall and others were very clean and counter man was helpful to non-Chinese speaking novices. We had similar chicken rice in a hawker market, but when it is 90F outside, it was nice to be in air conditioned comfort

I had a late night take out from Sergeant after visiting Singapore Motorshow. Service and quality of food are appreciated from this small stall. Try the roasted chicken and choose medium size for more quality white meat and bigger volume. Unlike other chains offering hainanese chicken rice, Sergeant doesn’t load your dish with plenty of chicken bones. Overall, very good dining experience.

Singapore is famed for its chicken rice and at the Wisma Atria food court- it houses the Sergeant brand. At 5.50, you can have a small plate of chicken rice, served with a nice home brewed soup. It's chili and ginger condiment adds a nice touch to the rice and soup. I felt the chicken meat was too soft but otherwise its rice and soup was tasty.The food court is easily accessible at B2 from Ion and also Wisma Shaw

Sergeant Chicken Rice is almost synonymous food courts chain stores. As with all chain stores, food standard varies with the chef even though ingredients used are the same. If you are looking for an introduction, this chain will not be a disappointment, but there are better ones if you really want to hunt for a better place

We ate here in the ION Food Hall 3 days in a row it was that good. The Hainanese Chicken is so simple and so delicious. The breast meat is impossibly tender and paired with a delicious chicken broth, coriander and the most superbly flavoured rice I have had. The rice alone is worth the visit.The flavours are subtle but intoxicating. This is simple comfort food done so very well and all for $7. Try it and see if you don't go back

I've dined at this establishment several times since coming to Singapore, and most of the time it is satisfying. The soup is wonderful, the chicken is usually cooked great and the rice is fragrant and amazing. Love that they provide a tasty chili sauce on the side. For $5, you can't go wrong! There was only one occasion where I got a bad piece of dark meat chicken that was fatty and rubbery. Most of the time, this is place is a safe bet for a quick, affordable meal. Seating is limited, and not very comfortable, but much better than most chicken rice stands
