This place has been one of My Favourite Food Hunt ever since my niece recommend to me. She not only brought me to this place and she paid for my meals every time we are here. We tried the from $3.50 for a bowl of Regular Prawn Noodles to $30 plus a bowl for 2-3 person to share. We simply loves this place and always looking forward to our available moment to travel from Jurong East to Toa Payoh for this Meal. Surely it will be an awesome meal that you will not regret or mind the travel distance. Nearest MRT will be Braddell then continue a few bus stops from there. Alternatively cab or grabcar will be affordable to this place too. Just head straight to Block 127 Lorong 1 Toa Payoh, stall number #02-2

Closest halal prawn noodles to those I get at home with the additions of sweet clams, crayfish and lobster. It comes with the proper chilli powder too. This is by someone who understands the market. Well marketed n Facebook and all the halal sites, there's a long queue everyday they are open. If only they will offer the dry version. This takes the dish to another level because cooking the noodles right becomes important
