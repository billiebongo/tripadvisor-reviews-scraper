The food was excellent and with very generous portions. The only draw back was that it’s a small restaurant, so when it’s full the noise level is a bit too loud for decent conversations.

Cosy little restaurant, serves decent Mexican food. Service is good, servings are pretty substantial bit pricy though. Finding parking around the area can be challenging.

My 2nd time at this restaurant. Has got some decent vegetarian options. This time had the Jalapeno fritters, Veg quesillida with mushrooms and cheese and the soft tacos. Great food. Had the salted caramel bread pudding. 5 stars for the appetizer and main course. Maybe 4 stars for desserts.

A very nice weekday catch up lunch with a longtime friend. The restaurant is in a very residential area with no office crowd. It was quiet & we had the whole place to ourselves. Service & food quality were very good & not compromised. Overall very satisfied:

Amazing staff service with good food. Not the best Mexican food because there were few hit and misses. For starters we ordered jalapeño fritters which were amazing and two main course dishes out of which the prawn tacos were best. Generous filling of Perfectly seasoned and grilled prawns which were not at all fishy. Second main course was their famous Yucatan chicken which was flop. The serving size was huge but the chicken marinade was too sweet . and I also felt that the chicken was slighty undercook may be we were the last customer so the cook made the dish in a hurry. Over all we enjoyed our food and definitely going to visit again to try some other dishes

The food is simply amazing.The crab quesadillas and oxtail stew ( Christmas menu ) is a must try. It's so good that I almost didn't want to share with my partner!I also had the cheesy dip thing and the beef dish ( can't remember the name ) and they were equally good.A must have is the churros and the margaritas!Lady boss and staff are friendly too.This is a must visit place if you love Mexican food

Margaritas restaurant is now called Comida Mexicana, revamped with colourful seats and cozy family atmosphere, their frozen margaritas to die for and they have delicious Mexican fare, try not to over order coz the portions are big, we chose one appetiser & one main to share, service was excellent and friendly lady owner would say hi to everywhere, and yes please make reservations weekends, will definitely come back !

We've been going to Margarita's for the last 16 years. The service is warm and friendly, it's a nice and cosy neighbourhood restaurant and the food is great: love the chicken burrito, beef fajitas and the fish....everything there is good, really. And of course the best frozen margarita's in the world. The perfect antidote for a stressful day. 16 years of dining there...need I say more? :

This is one place we come to for our regular Mexican fix.High quality food prepared delicately each time.I am a fan of corn and am thrilled to taste their new corn dish and would highly recommend it ~ ELOTE ASADOS (Mexican Street-Style Corn on Cob) Yummy

I am a regular at Margaritas for a number of years. The food never disappoints , love the carne asada , margaritas chicken , beef ribs, and the Mexican version of popiah, olive rice (!) to name a few , and mouth watering desserts like their churros , chocolate brownies, and pancakes . The staff are always welcoming and the owner comes around regularly to check that the diners are well looked after. A family and friends favourite to dine out, whether for casual or special occasions. Also good for potluck takeaways This review is long overdue !

Frozen Lime Margaritas were excellent. We had the chicken burritos and the quesadilla was specially prepared with crab meat. Both meals were very delicious.
Service staff were very polite. Highly recommended if you love Mexican food.

A sweet place to drop by for quick meal on the east coast. Delicious food , great service but a bit expensive.

I selected the $16 house white which was in drinkable. Asked for an alternative and was advised that this is what I selected and had too pay. $42 wasted.

Magarita's @ East Coast serves not just Mexican food, but absolutely delicious Mexican food. Friends and visitors we brought to Magarita's always had a pre-conceived idea of what Mexican food is all about, but ended up impressed and blown away by what was served to them. You can basically close your eye and point at the menu and any dish you pick would be a mouth-watering choice, but we prefer to let the very friendly host Vivian fix the menu for us. Her choice is always perfect. The dishes that come out of the kitchen are tasty, flavourful, balanced and always fresh. And Magarita's serves excellent magaritas, reason enough to visit it

You cannot leave a restaurant called "Margarita's" without having it's Margaritas for sure. Having had some of the best & the worst Margarita's around the globe. This quaint spot in East Coast simply ranks on top for the unassumingly potent frozen slush (or on the rocks if you prefer). Go for the 'top shelf' stuff...you'll notice a big difference in flavor. Aside to the uber good cocktail, the food does the country of origin justice. While I usually stick to my usual Tex Mex fix of Chimichanga, which I find it's a perfect match with the Margaritas...The other menu items are just as delicious and authentic, rarely seen in this little red dot. Definitely try the carnitas or the yucatan pork or the crab enchiladas...or where in doubt, just simply ask one of the friendly servers to recommend.Ultimately, this is one of the few Mexican joints in Singapore you ought to head to when craving great Mexican fare. Yum yums

A quaint and cosy little eatery tucked in the East Coast. They serve the best fajitas, margarita chicken and the meat just peels off the rib bones when you touch it. Of course you must order their signature margarita to go with your food. The little kids feel good grown up when they sip their virgin margaritas. Top your meal off with the tiramisu or the brownie with coconut ice cream and you go home feeling so so satisfied. The staff is pleasant and cheerful and ever ready to help change your plates if you are sharing food to eat. I recommend sharing so you can order more and try out more dishes.

My son's a great fan of Tacos. Even though the restaurant has a great range of tacos, tortillas, etc. the food was a dismay. The only saving grace is the good and attentive service. But that alone does not make a restaurant good. It can make a good restaurant bad, but not the other way round. And to top it up, the price was atrociously high. It was even higher than the restaurants in the private club at Republic Plaza.If you are crazing for Mexican fare, you wont satisfy your craze here.

1) very good food though there are limited choices 2) good Mexican drinks, margaritas and chile beer, micheladas are my favourites 3) very good service4) owner himself is there and pays attention to all guests personally 5) very nice ambiance 6) a bit expensive but you pay for the quality service and ambience too apart from food so it doesn't look unreasonable

Have been a regular at Margarita's at East Coast Road for a number of years but this is my first (overdue) review of the restaurant. The portions are amazingly large and have not yet been disappointed with any dishes served so far. Try the queso fundido appetizer if you love cheese. It's a hot plate of melted cheese, onions, peppers, tomatoes and chorizo, eaten with chips. The sangrias are one of the best in Singapore. Service is fast and friendly. Roadside parking is available but fills up fast especially on weekends

Jugs of Margaritas set the scene while we caught up with friends and chose from the varied menu. All the dishes were authentic, plentiful and tasty. The waiting staff were friendly and efficient.This restaurant is a good place to socialise with friends. On the next table a family were celebrating their young daughter's birthday, so it's good for families too. We had a great night and look forward to another visit soon

Super place, warm welcome. Amazing cocktails. Foord was very tasty, not too spicy but full of flavour. Service was great.
5
This place serve very good Mexican food and ingredients use is fresh. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
You can ask the staff to recommend the food which is a good choice.

I hadn't been to Margarita's in quite a while, but it won't be long before I visit again. The food, drinks and service were all very good and my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our evening there. The owner remembered me despite the fact I'd not seen her in ages. In Singapore's big and very competitive restaurant industry, that's a rarity

I went to Margarita's with friends. We ordered kitchen sink burrito, beef fajitas and few other dishes including portobello mushroom. Good food! We were happy with what we ordered. Furthermore, the service was very good! They were attentive and helpful. Downside, the ambience is not that great. The restaurant is quite small and the tables are too near one another. The one in Dempsey is much nicer. Nevertheless, we had a good time.

We haven't been here for several months. We always happy to take taxi from our home in the city center to here which cost us ~22S$ taxi fare. Today, we're really regrets to do so. They must have been change management /chef here. The quality of food was quite BAD compared to our old excellent experience in past few years.We ordered ;- Nachos which served in cold, runny tube cheese sauce, 10 tiny cubes of tomato, mixed fresh & processed guacamole and on top of that there was a lot of cheap lettuces on it. It like a salad nachos. If you have read my 1,000+ reviews you will see that I never complain about price. I do understand for renting cost, training or hiring good staffs and etc. But this dish for 21S$ after gst & service charge, I expected fresh and good quality ingredients NOT something came from tube or jar. So, my hubby stopped eating it after 5-6 pieces. I tolerated more by scraped all those runny processed cheese off. In my opinion, this plate is only worth 4-5$ maximum for quality of food court level. After the nachos experiences, we both kinda worried what will happen next??? - Grill Fish Burritos which served soaking in tomatoes sauce. I have been in US a few times and been to a few mexican restaurants both real and tex-mex styles.. Never got grill burritos wet like this.Wraps was tasteless and chewy. Fish wasn't juicy as the good quality one would be. It was edible but Not enjoyable. - Enchiladas De Pollo which my hubby tried 2 bites. He said it was soggy and mushy plus taste quite bad. He told the waiter to take it back and also told him that nachos was bad enough and he aren't take anymore bad food from here. 3 mins later the same waiter brought the same dish back and put it in front of him again. So, he repeated the same sentence.Luckily we both order drinks from bottles today.. 1 San Miguel and 1 Merlot. If I order pitcher of magarita as usual and turn out bad too.. This place will definitely get 1* from me. And it would be #No.18# Terrible out of my total of 1,018 reviews. The service was bearable tonight. We definitely CUT OFF this place out from our favorite place for Mexican in Singapore.
3
Most important thing first: The food was quite tasty, however it comes with a price tag... For two main courses + soft drinks we payed more than 100 SGD. With drinks and / or starter / dessert you can easily reach 200 bucks for a couple.The restaurant is relatively small and they squeeze-in as many table as possible. You shouldn't expect much privacy + the noise level gets very high when the restaurant is full
3
The food was ok tasty and plenty but a little expensive for what you had. Portions were quite large but bulked up with the cheaper ingredients! We enjoyed the food, the service was average for the region but we wouldn't say it was very good value for the price paid.
5
I've been here many times over the last decade and the high standards in the ingredients, cooking and service has been maintained consistently. Vivian the owner is friendly and passionate about her food, offers great personal service along with her staff of mainly Filippinos. The Vera Cruz - fish baked in a rich tomato broth with some chilli and spices - is my favorite. Their grilled meats - steak and chicken - are also excellent. Portions are large and several main courses come with some salad and rice, so it offers value despite prices that are on the high side. Desserts are also good. The menu changes once in a while. Parking may be a problem and one typically has to park in the lanes behind the restaurant.

Tried this place based on trip advisor reviews and I wasn't disappointed. It offers tasty Mexican food in a simple but comfortable setting. Restaurant is located in the heart of the city.we were recommended an off menu baked spinach and tortilla dish similar to lasagna. It was tasty. Food was served very quickly on a Saturday evening and overall service of the staff was good
5
We usually did a double date here quite often in past 4 years. Jug of margaritas were always excellent the end of the night 4 of us go thru at least 3 jugs. Foods is always good such as fish tacos, chicken enchiladas, bake fish in tomatoes sauce, seafood fajita etc. The services by Filipino ladies always exceed my expectation. Another outlet in Demsy Hill is our first try on this restaurant. We went there a few times but it's hard to get a taxi back home and also hard to find the blk no. So, end up went to East Coast instead.
5
Have travelled and never found a Mexican restaurant that does chicken dish like margaritas chicken. Vivian the owner takes a lot of care in preparing this dish, mixing her own marinade. Worth every morsel.
4
Checked out the menu which looks great for a Mexican inspired meal. My margarita was just the right size and mix. We weren't in the mood for mexican but would give it a chance if returning.

Drinks 5*

We love going to Margarita's. The food is always excellent and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. I love the carne asada (to share!) and the margaritas are amazing. We always have a fantastic time here and come away happy and stuffed. Vivian the owner and all her staff make such an effort to make sure everyone is well looked after

This is my second visit to the restaurant . I find that they have added new items to the menu and service was just as good. For starters, I ordered mushrooms sautÃ©ed with garlic and chile guajillo. It was tangy, a little spicy and extremely yums. The crabmeat quesadilla was moist and tasty, and went very well with my 84-year dad. Main course was grilled Mexican steak, served with tortillas, guacamole, sour cream and salsa. A large enough portion for 2 average eaters or 3 small eaters. To top it all, dessert of fried ice cream with coconut shavings and the house special tiramisu were simply heavenly. Service was very good. There was very regular topping up of our glasses with ice water ( a service that is quite rarely seen nowadays, if the restaurant even offer ice water at all!). A good place to bring family as this place is child- and senior- friendly

Whoever hired the staff did a great job. It was nice to sit down at a non-high end restaurant (a normal eatery) in Singapore and have great service. I know that sounds a bit high and mightly, but Singaporeans and non Singaporeans alike, in Singapore, all voice the same complaints about the low level of service at restaurants.Guacamole was decent but could have been better. I had the fajitas, very good, and my friend had the burrito, also good. I would definitely go back, but i would try other dishes. The quantities here were huge. When I left the restaurant, I felt like a stuffed pig, and I ate around 50% of the food on my plate
5
We came here on a childless date night.My wife had shrimp tacos and she loved them.I had the kitchen sink burrito and it was fantastic. It was actually gigantic and I took 1/2 home to eat as leftovers.We each had a margarita and split a 3rd. They were $19 each.. which seems a bit high, but they were pretty good
4
Margarita 's is my favourite "go to "place for tasty tempting food. The cocktails and mocktails are fun too. We were celebrating a birthday and the owner gave us a lot of personal attention and recommended several dishes which were off menu. For this reason, without cake or candles our dad enjoyed his 83 rd birthday dinner. Also I love their colourful decor

Just had dinner at margarita. We spent $660 on dinner & drinks. Food was good and they gave generous portions. However I found 2 hairs in my food, I didn't make a fuss when I found first strand of hair in my rice however when I had to pull 2nd strand out of my mouth I has to tell waitress. I was told they would get back to me on what they would do since I refuse a new serving of food. Good that they decided to take my dish off the bill but I was curious as to why they had to even discuss it and get back to me later. Last orders is at 10pm, this is for everything, food, drinks & desserts. We ordered 2 pitchers of margaritas on last orders, thinking we had the time to at least enjoy our drinks. Staff told us they would stagger our drinks so no worries. 11pm our group got ask to leave, staffs were changed, bags on the table and ready to go. We felt very disappointed at this, having spent so much on our bill and ordering 2 pitchers of drinks only to be rush a total of 4 times by the staffs!! Sorry but this is not good for business. You cannot kick your customers out 1hr after last orders! We were a party of 8 and we would never come back to this place after this treatment. To be fair the staff were good until that point. But making your customers feel unwelcomed after what was a good dinner was a terrible mistake. Had they told us restaurant closes at 11pm we wouldn't have ordered our last order and we wouldn't hold up the staffs who were desperate to leave and we would have continue our evening next door where people were still able to enjoy their drinks.

we went to celebrate my friend and my birthday at Margarita at East Coast Road in 11 Jan 2014 (Sat). We had a few authentic mexican food like quesadillas, Nachos La Especial, portobellow mushroom, fajitas and also margarita drinks too In fact, I went to visit another branch at Dempsey one week ago before 11 Jan. I felt the atomsphere was different concept but both were good.It is a must to try their salad. Was awesome but I felt the East Coast's salad have a nicer presentation and a better spread but the owner told me that it was different mould.Service Staff were friendly for both branches. The owner from East Coast knew that it was my friend and my birthday. She quickly instructed the kitchen to make two different kinds of desserts for us as a surprise treat :) She was so sweet

Very quiet on a Sunday lunch time. Service is good. The food is noting to rave about. The portobello mushroom was okay. The fajitas was so so. The price though was really steep.
5
I was excited to see mole and other authentic Mexican dishes on the menu. The drinks, after which this restaurant is named, are expensive but deelish!
3
Mexican is few and far between in Singapore. Food is ok but the restaurant is terrible for the 'kitchen is closing' and rushing your courses. Is a pity as it could be a great restaurant.
3
Newly renovated...used to like it A LOT. Perhaps have to do this again without the kiddos.
3
not bad, but pricey.
4
Tequila chicken a MUST TRY and drinks are great too - even the mocktails !

This restaurant was recommend by a friend and it didn't disappoint. We go there at least once a week for dinner and that should say a lot about the place. The service staff are very friendly, which is a welcome change. They've a fairly extensive menu and can even make most of the dishes in vegetarian. It gets fairly crowded during evenings. My personal favorites are the nachos, burritos, fajitas, tamarind margarita, and buenellos. The restaurant is pricey, but hey you get what you pay for. Not everything can be hawker center cheap. And for the price, it is still fairly crowded which again speaks a lot about the quality. This place is a nice dining option for a small group gathering or a nice couple's dinner. After our repeated visits, the staff know now exactly what we want and how we want it without having to tell them again. Now that is something rare in Singapore. In my opinion, this is simply the best Mexican place in Singapore
2
We came here for dinner and the waiting staff were friendly and attentive. There were three tables filled for the night, we did appreciate the quiet vibe to end a manic work day. The enchilada and burrito was pretty uninspiring. There just wasn't a distinctive taste to it. Plain. Portions were generous and there were lots of meat in each dish. I like that the meat was shredded instead of minced, there was a nice bite instead of rather mashy meat had they used minced meat.But for the rather tepid taste and prices I would not be coming back anytime soon
3
For a place called Margaritas, you would think they would make a decent drink by the same name. At $56, it is far from the best I have tried. We tried the nachos which were also pricey for wha you get. Small portion with too few nachos.Will not go back
5
My review is based on the time before the joint underwent a significant expansion, when it was still exuding its unique "Once Upon A Time in Mexico" ambience.Taste-wise, though I am no Tex-Mex aficionado, the rendition of dishes I tried my one and only time there left me a deep impression of the passion gone into creating each dish.It was a cosy place back then with merely about seven or so tables (mainly for two) inside, but there should be double the room now with the most recent renovation. Hope they retain the great ambience, though
