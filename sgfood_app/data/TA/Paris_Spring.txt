A typical Singapore `Zhi Char` Restaurant (with aircon). Heard from the waitress just shifted over from Queentown and open for about 1 month. Restaurant is doing some promotion and the price for the foods are reasonable and food taste above average. Come and Enjoy.

Came here multiple times as my family lives near the area. Love the local zhi char dishes here especially the prawn paste chicken which is really crispy and juicy, the hotplate tofu with seafood and their stir fried beef is good too! They have hot pot and the place is air con too. Highly recommended!
