Lime Deli is sister to Lime House, the original and very first authentic Caribbean eatery in Singapore. Lime Deli features Lime Houseâ€™s established favourites, like Jerk Chicken and Coffee-Rubbed Steak, alongside delicious Caribbean street eats like Trini Roti, Jamaican Patties and hearty soups.

Ok. So this place is a little gem. If you don't know what to have for dinner and you just want some healthy, hearty food cooked perfectly, head to the Lime Deli. The staff are friendly, cheerful and chatty. The Tuesday night chef is particularly good and clearly takes pride in his Caribbean meals. We come here every week now and leave with a salad for tomorrow's lunch. The goat, chicken and vegie curries are excellent and the buttered vegies are perfectly cooked. We also like the okra and spinach in coconut milk - a new dish for us. We like to wash it all down with a cold beer and if you arrive between 6 and 8pm you can get the meal and drink deals for $15. A bargain. The decor is bright, clean and basic but the tunes are right out of Jamaica giving the place the right kind of casual vibe. Give it a go for something a bit different.
