They serve good carrot cake (Asian style). However, the hawker has been closed for renovation recently and may remain close for a year.
After it re-open, the stalls may or may not be around anymore.

Nice fish soup and duck rice is good. Many coffee stalls there. Nasi Padang is not bad. I will miss this place when renovation start next month.

Nothing to scream about.
But if you have a strong urge for Fried Kway Tiao or you are a tourist and today is your last day in Singapore , this may suffice.
It just passed the pass mark .
