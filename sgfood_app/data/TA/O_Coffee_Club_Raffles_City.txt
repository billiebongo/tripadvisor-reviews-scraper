Took them over 20 minutes to serve the waffles with fried chicken and scrambled eggs. Chicken was good but would have liked the waffles crispier. The gula melaka cream which served as the syrup was nice enough. Ditto the salted egg yolk sauce.

Stopped for a break after shopping at Raffles City Shopping Centre.Delicious 'Vitamin C' late - but the best thing was 'Cup of Joe'.Download the app whilst you wait, take a picture, decide on your choice of coffees and your picture is transferred onto the top of the coffee!! What next?Friendly staff - regular top ups of iced water.Coffee S$5.40, Coke S$3

The staff were so friendly and lovely which enticed me in.I opted for the coffee and cake deal. Cake selection was small but the Black Forest cake caught my eye. The was OK, the coffee was OK. Everything was just extremely average.Lovely staff but will probably not return

It's a good place to have a meal when you want something convenient and not too crowded. It's like a fast food place but table serving. There are some good promos and the chef recommended dishes are decent. Chili crab linguini is alright. Just the right amount of tomato sauce. The poached salmon not the best though and the grilled chicken is not too bad. Coffee is also pretty decent. Good service tho.

~we're waiting on getting lunch but was too hungry so Sally & I decided on a snack at O' coffee club ~I'd a really nice chicken & turkey sandwich, super tasty except for the long wait even with the place just 1/4 full when I arrivedWhile iconic as a coffee café, the food was good but for the slow service, there are many choices in Raffles City Shopping Centre

Celebrated wife's birthday at this branch as we were near Raffles City. This branch is quietly tucked away at a corner overlooking the Café Swiss buffet line at Swissotel The Stamford. We were greeted promptly by the courteous service staff to our seats.The ambiance would have been better if lightings at this branch was fixed. We ordered the Signature Chilli Crab Lingguine, Xpresso Baby Pork Ribs, Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon and Nachos with Chicken to share. I find the Eggs Benedict different as the yolks were full cooked. I prefer flowy yorks. I liked the pork ribs the best. I also had the Earl's Vanilla which I found very refreshing.Overall, we were still happy with the meal and service

Brought the family for birthday dinner as we enjoy 50% birthday priviledges. This outlet is tucked away from the bustling crowd of the shopping mall one level above and overlooking the Café Swiss in Swissôtel The Stamford. Good to go place if you want a more quiet and private environment. However, the light fixtures need to be replaced as it is a bit dark (not in the romantic way). Service is prompt and good as we were greeted with smiles. Ordered the Xpresso BBQ Pork Ribs, Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon, Signature Chilli Crab Linguinne and Nachos with Chicken to share. Liked the pork ribs best as it hint of coffee. The Eggs Benedict was not up to expectation as it did not had flowy york. For drinks, I liked the Earl's Vanilla - Earl Grey tea topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream - refreshing
