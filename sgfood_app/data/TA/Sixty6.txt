Everything was great except for the waiting time of food is too long. Staffs were friendly and humourous! We've been there twice and will definitely be back again.

The food is better than the other Thai restaurants located around in the Rochor area in my opinion. Portions are not small and food gets served fast. Great for gatherings due to cosy settings and big space outside the restaurant.

Only one person taking orders, clearing tables, doing cashier and serving up the orders. Could have an extra pair of hands to help out. Highly recommend the Thai Red Curry!!

Service was great despite having no service charge. Loved that the food tasted like home cooked food and was resonably priced. The Thai milk tea and Thai green milk tea weren't too sweet too.

We ordered the prawns, Phad Thai, Long beans with salted egg & fish maw soup. Long beans with salted egg was something different & was delicious. The prawns dish was good too. However, the fish maw soup was extremely salty. There was complimentary parking coupon provided but we didnâ€™t park there

The place is not big, and the atmosphere is very friendly, with little kids (of the owner I assumed) running around.The menu is full of options to choose from, which each dish having the separate choice of meat, fish or vegi.We ordered the vegi fried rice, and vegi pad thai. Both dishes were good in terms of portion and flavors. The bill was only 12SGD, and no GST or service charge
