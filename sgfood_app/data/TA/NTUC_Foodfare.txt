Located at the basement of Clifford Centre, this foodcourt is convenient for those working at Raffles Place, especially now when the Golden Shoe hawker centre is closed. There is a variety of food to choose from, and there is a discount if you are a NTUC union member. You do have to wait for a seat during the lunch hour unless you come early. It is also opened on Saturdays but donâ€™t expect all stall to be operating

Foodfare (also signed as Food Emporium) is as crowded as any hawker centre but is cleaner and airconditioned. Prices may be higher to suit the financial centre location (chicken rice for $6, an Indian vege feast for $7) but you can still get quality foods, and if you don't like the crowds, you can get takeaway and cross over the Oue walkway to the waterside
