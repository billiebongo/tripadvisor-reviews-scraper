Various selection of foods, I love the barley they have here. Affordable price, good portion, delicious and friendly staff too!
(For myself, a portion they serve can feed both; me and my friend)

This restaurant has the best rotis in the world! The butter chicken is delicious, as were all the dishes we ate. Good value and huge range to choose from.

This place at Serangon road near with farerr park station. You can find delicious food ala Melayu and Hindia. And the price is cheap for everything. You have to taste Nasi Ayam Sambal or bubur ayam in here. So, delicious! I want to go there again oneday! I love this resto! And the waiter is so friendly. The place is comfortable

Since my previous review, service quality, food presentation and food preparation have.....overall... gone south of the border. Yeah... sulch a bad drop. Sigh.The fish and chips were overfried - as is obvious from pictures attached. The char kway teow featured green chillies, soy sauce colouring ... and pretty much nothing else.Operator need to revamp to check slid sliding down further

Food quality have improved since my last review.We dined on12/Jan/2017 - 8.40pm.Service, ie order taking.. is expected to be on a learning-curve. To be fair, this is my assumption... seeing a lot more new staff... from China. I opted for the regular Indian staffers to attend to me.Food options are varied. Local and western treats are on offer. We had ginger tea (hot), fish and chips, mee goreng. Mee Goreng comprises of yellow chinese noodles, cooked Indian style, with a dash of western ketchup. Howz that for ethnic mix?Also, an impressive range of drinks - as shown in my pic.Overall, a reasonable watering hole. Al fresco and indoors dining beckons. Smokers' section is lined along part of the footpath by the roadside. Carpark lots are available... if you are lucky.Cat lovers will be pleased to note there are cats on the premises.. though the China-staff frequently pet them, feed them, play with them... and I don't see them sanitizing their hands after that... right before the eyes of the owner/supervisor.

I tried Bubur Taiwan since it recommended when i searched "halal food in Singapore" on web. Bubur Taiwan is rice porridge served with, in bahasa We called it teri kacang, kangkung , telur asin (salted egg), telur pitan, ikan jambal asin (salted fish), and sambal.Even the portion is quite big for me, I managed to eat up.Many kinds of dishes like murtabak, ayam penyet, rendang, and prataLocation:- few minutes walk from 60's hostel- near Farrer Park MRT Station- near City Square MallOpen 24 hour

Alfresco and indoor dining. Good variety of dishes and drinks available. Located at the corner of Petain Road and Serangoon Road. Ample parking lots. Halal food with selected 'Smoking Section',Char Kuay Teow came piping hot and delicious. Blueberry drink, iced and in a large cup was great. The Ayam Penyet dish could be improved upon. The chicken was sizeable portion wise, but very dry. The dish could do with a bit of gravy/sauce although soup was served. The pickles was tasty and crunchy. No quarrels with the soybean tempeh. The lettuce slices tasted bitter.We also had fish and chips. The fish fillet was disappointing, looking like the 2 slices were refried. Hence the 'Average" rating of this review

I ordered seafood chard kwetiau, small portion. For Indonesian like me it was still too much. I thought it would be flat and plain, but it was unexpectedly delicious. I like it so much. And i also tasted nasi goreng seafood from my friend, it was also tasty. Not only the food, i like the atmosphere and the staff. They were really friendly. And the location is in serangoon road, not far from mustafa centre. I recommend you to come and taste it

Service, I must say I really appreciate their attentiveness. Arrived at 9 am, but the porridge morning batch was not ready yet. Though disappointed as I was really looking forward to the porridge given that so many raved about it, ordered my drink first to contemplate the next makan option. 10 minutes later the server came and asked if I still want the porridge, which was now ready. So I had my porridge in the end, and boy, it was worth the wait. Huge portion, varieties of condiments. With teh ais, what a good combo! Chatted with one of the servers, and guess what, he's a Malaysian, so we ended up talking about his hometown. Total for my meal was SD 7.50

Ordered roti John cheese mushroom, take away. Got my order and went home without checking what's in the wrapper. And this is what I got. U serious ah. If I staying near I don't mind going back. I stay all the way at boon lay. Ruin my mood.

We always wanted to try this place as it's always crowded. I had Maggi goreng beef, with one ice black tea. My friend had two prata. I don't really fancy Maggi goreng, but they make the best Maggi goreng I've had, my friend also love it a lot. Price is much the same to all these kind of shop, but the food is really good. I would love to try other food next time.

Nice foodcourt, great meals for a good price! We eat two times and both days we enjoyed! We had a claypot and tom yam noodles and nasi pattaya. All very tasteful. Place is always crowded with locals and tourists. Eating like a king for less than 10 dolla

Me and family were walking to the Mustafa Center from the Inn when we saw Adamâ€™s Corner and instantly try it. The food taste really good, served fastly and friendly waiters. Portion packed here is quite large for the average portion of Indonesian people. At the time of breakfast on the last day in Singapore before returning to Indonesia, we (4 adults) stop by again to Adam's Corner to order 4 portions of fried rice in Adam's Corner and we are only able to eat two portions so two we wrapped the other two portions. The plane was scheduled to fly at 8.55 pm, and in the afternoon after boarding we thought still wrapped fried rice Adam's Corner, we try to eat whether it feels it's still tasty. Apparently still taste great
