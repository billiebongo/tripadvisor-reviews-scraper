We were a group of 4, 3 of us having steaks and 1 having pasta. We upgraded to set meal which added a soup and a drink. The food was quite reasonable for the price. Good value. Will probably visit again.

It was a very good visit to Hot Tomato Cafe and Grill. The choice of food was good for all and the service crew were hardworking and attentive.

Stopped here after a long morning walking down Orchard Rd. This place is a gem great food at great prices. The steak was amazing juicy tender and yummy.

Came here for the lunch set. Ordered Salmon steak with fries. Very affordable pricing and decent food quality. This place has a wide variety of choices too. Will be back next time!

Service was prompt. I ordered the salmon teriyaki set meal that comes with a drink and soup. Soup and drink were served vey promptly, however the soup (tomato) was lukewarm. The salmon teriyaki was ok, small portions, edible. Don't think I would return.

Staffs are friendly and able to accommodate my needs. Been there many times for the steak and it's good for the prices that I paid.
5
Very surprised by excellent meal here. Food and service was above expectations. And did I mention the price? Most eateries along Orchard are pricey to say the least. Be sure to look for the “set” price which includes soup and beverage for very little more rather than ala carte.

We had the half chicken and prawns combo and the sirloin salad. The food was ok. I mean its not something you would crave for, but definitely worth it when it comes to the price. servings were actually more than enough for us and we were not able to finish out order. tiramisu was also good. small portion but it was good enough. warm water is charged at $.2

We love to dine here after work. Prices are reasonable for the foods. Promotion was a good deal set lunch come with a glass of drinks and SOD, and 20% for every mains. I love their steak and pasta lime dressing was a very good combination. .Tried their chocolate lava too. Good service, friendly and attentive. We surely be back again.

Service was indeed prompt, however the quality of food were terrible. I ordered a Cesar salad and the vegetables were not fresh. I understand that staff claim it's fresh from the morning, but the leaves were brownish and to continue insisting that it's fresh makes me feel that the staff are not genuinely serving me. No apologies were given and they even got one of our order wrongly. I believe a consistency in the food quality between the outlets are needed as Nex's outlet has better standards.

Friends and I love dining here. Prices are reasonable, food is great and the ambience is just right. Their salad is amazing and their beef was cooked well.

Recommend this to everyone. Has great choices and a very nice setting. Lovely service. Would go again and I am going again soon!

We always come here for the steak, and usually on Weekday lunchtime for the lunch offer, which makes it one of the cheapest places to get a decent steak at.

I never thought that the food is very good, tried the grilled salmon with mango salsa and the grilled chicken with is really tasty. Service is also very fast.

Visited the westgate outlet. This is the first time dining at Hot tomato.Ordered the dory and garlic Prawn. Spread the butter & drizzle with the lemon, but still did not enjoy my meal.No garlic taste on the Prawn. the noodles have a pinch of garlic taste but mostly tastes oily. dory tastes bland.did not finish my meal & as can seen the food was oily even though there was leftover of butter.My hub ordered the rosemary chicken with shrimp with the chicken being dry. The additional olive rice was bland too.Will not revisit

We come here every time we go to orchard road after a fun filled day of shopping. It always finishes off our day rather nicely and never fails to satisfy.The atmosphere of the restaurant is casual and usually the patrons include groups of friends catching up, families and other happy shoppers so the camaraderie is easy going and friendly.The staff are completely helpful and are swift at taking your orders and complying to your requests.The food in itself is very fulsome and gob smacking. For extremely reasonable prices the portions are quite wholesome. Definitely the best part is the food as very rarely in sg do you get to eat good food without burning a hole in your pocket.The entire experience is very satisfactory. Excellent value for money and a great casual atmosphere. Very rare do I genuinely like a place so much

The student value meal is great and worth the money. The environment is cool and I think is great for gathering dinner. Overall service is good. I recommend to give this place try when nearby

I was at Westgate (Jurong East) looking for something to eat, and we came upon Hot Tomato. There was no queue and the food pictures look relatively nice, so we decided to give it a try. I ordered the fish and chips and my wife ordered the prawn pasta, and we ordered the set meal which comes with mushroom soup and a drink.The mushroom soup tasted bland and slightly too starchy. The fish and chips which I had was made up of 2 pieces of frozen pre-made fish in a trapezoid shape (all the cook needed to do is to drop it into a fryer), some chips, tartar sauce, and some greens. My wife's prawn pasta was super oily, and at the end of the meal, there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the plate. The 4 prawns which they serve were not succulent, but limp and soft, hence, it was not fresh. The pasta was "so-so".All in all, the food was below average, but their service was better than the food. This is a place we would not be eating at again

Restaurant was not well organised, one of the staff saw me at the entrance but didn't acknowledge my existence at all. Customers have to enter and look for seats themselves, causing my queue to be cut by someone else. Smile was lacking from the faces of the staff. However food was good and was being served promptly.

Hot Tomato is one of the cafes that i like and satisfied with. The food there are fair prices and delicious, especially, their steak. They have good service and nice atmosphere of their interior. I would be back and visit them again next time. Recommend you to try their food out!

Value for money place for lunch. The tenderloin steak is not as good as Aston but the pasta was nice. Tomato soup is good but skip the escargots. They are small and burnt.

I visited this cafe with 7 other people, this was one of the cafe with no queuing. We expect very little, because we were so hungry and cant afford to queu.We started with caesar salad, very refreshing veggies and sauces. Then we had Sirloin Steak, Chicken Teriyaki, Beef+Shrimp, and Salmon Teriyaki. We were very happy with all of the dishes, they all tasted great, and we especially liked the spaghetti that comes with the steaks.The only downside (abit) was the service, maybe they need to add more staffs

I was wandering through the 313 Shopping Mall when I came upon this cafe (it's really not a restaurant). Having read some fairly positive reviews, and hoping to beat the evening dinner crowd, I decided to have an early dinner. I ordered the tomato and basil soup, the escargots, the lobster linguine and a Diet Coke. The server was very pleasant, but I don't think she - or any other staff there - spoke English (despite English being an official language in Singapore, and this being a very popular shopping centre). The soup was served very quickly - but unfortunately it was tepid. I had scarcely finished my first spoonful when the escargots arrived - and they were very hot, but I left them for after the soup. After two more spoonfuls of soup, the linguine arrived! So I now had three courses set before me on a very small table. I finished the soup - tasty, but as I said, lukewarm, and then tackled the escargots. They were pretty good, considering the fact that I was in a shopping mall cafe. Then I attempted to move the two empty dishes around so I could get at the linguine, and I accidentally knocked over my drink - it went everywhere! But three staff members quickly came to the rescue, wiping and mopping everything up quickly - and whisking away the empty dishes. So no great damage was done, except to my pride! The linguine wasn't linguine - it was spaghetti. And the lobster wasn't lobster - it was squid. But there was chillie in the dish, and I had specifically and emphatically told the server that I am highly allergic to hot chillie (I go into anaphylactic shock). One mouthful told me that this was a no-go. I called the server over and reminded her that I had twice requested no chilie when I ordered the dish. She apologised and took it away, and after only a few minutes brought a new dish sans chillie. (But it was still lobster linguine without the lobster and the linguine!). I ate it - it was not what I had anticipated when I ordered, and the taste of bacon overpowered everything else (the menu description mentioned bacon, but this was large pieces - I could have had breakfast with it!). I had a scoop of strawberry ice cream for dessert - you can't stuff that up! All in all, it was an okay meal, but I wouldn't go back there again. However, every staff member was pleasant and helpful, and if they were in a better eatery they would go far. They were a credit to this cafe

The food is average and the portion are little small for the price. As a tourist, I suggest you head over to some other places for a better western meal

If you are looking for a reasonably priced and good tasting steak in a Singapore Mall, I highly recommend eating at this place. They have branches in Sommerset, Plaza Singapura, etc. I LOVE their Steak and Prawn which comes with a aglio olio pasta and green salad. I really enjoyed the dressing on the salad. If only they could sell that awesome dressing, I would totally buy it! They also have option if you want to go get a Set which comes with a drink and soup. MUST TRY!My husband and I love this place!Steak and Prawn $13.50 Upgrade to $2.50 or $3.50 for a set, depending on the time you are there. Ashley Vetsc

I love the chicken, it is Delicious and tasty. This has a Good and fast service from the staff. You don't need to spend more as it has a Reasonable price. It is Easy access to any transport services

Wow, this place was great to eat at. It is within plaza singapura mall food court. The food is inexpensive and very good quality. We tried the steak, creamy pasta with tiger prawns, creamy chicken and mushroom pasta and bangers and mash. All were great. We also had 2 soft drinks each and the cost was only $77. The staff were friendly and not intrusive. I would definitely recommend you try a meal here.

There are several Hot Tomato restaurants in various Shopping Centres around Singapore. The primary food is Pasta and grill (Steak, Pork, Lamb chops) and they do it better than many top-line restaurants anywhere in the world. Especially great for family meals with the most delicious pasta dishes (carbonara, with prawns) and beautifully cooked steaks or lamb chops. Also really nice fresh caesar salads. Service is at the top of Singapore standards which is high anyway. Unhurried and very accommodating for children too. 2 adults and 2 kids can walk away very full and more than satisfied for a very low price - under SG$60

We've been going to the branch at Star Vista (Bueno Vista MRT) regularly, and it keeps getting better. S$8.50++ for the bargain lunch, plus $2.50 for soup and a drink, is unbeatable. The main course is either is presentable steak, or a roast half-chicken, or fish and chips, or a pasta dish, and every one is great. The place is smart, and clean and the service fast and friendly. Watch out for Francis, the excellent waiter. If he's on shift, he is likely to entertain customers with excerpts from the opera - Italian, Cantonese, English - whatever. Five star treatment at a one-star price
