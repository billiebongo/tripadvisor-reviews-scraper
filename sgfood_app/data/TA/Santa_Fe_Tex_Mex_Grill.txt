Decided to visit during lunchtime because they had a promotional set menu that was pretty affordable. The proportion was generous and their desserts tasted amazing, have visited this restaurant a couple of times now and they never seem to disappoint.

Food was very good . Kids loved it. Ambience and experience was fantastic. Every dish was very good . Will definitely come again .
5
Great experience eating on a boat. Restaurant is not too crowded and food is good in general. Highly recommended.
4
Food was strictly western and tasted mediocre. Cosy and unique venue made up for the lacklustre meal.
3
Quality of the food is very bad
Same goes for their cocktail, it taste so horrible
Service was okok only.
Overall a average experience and very dissapointed. Will not visit again

It was a different kind of dining experience as it was a on a ship and you’ll move as the ship sways a litle due to the currents

An Indian male employee stood out and helped me out with bfâ€™s bday surprise. Knows when to fire bday cake and is efficient. Apart from floor service, boat was really shaky I almost had to puke, but contained anyway. If you have sea sick do rmb to bring giddy medicine! Music at the back was quite loud though
4
Nice display of food especially at first deck.However, the fajitas are only limited to 1 per serving. Drinks are not stated to be free-flow. Thank goodness there is water. Buffet food spread may not taste warm each round.Atmosphere and dining experience is great and cosy.
4
The place was very easy to find. You can hop on the red line and alight at marina south pier. The restaurant is right there on a boat.The place looked pretty with great deco, however, if you're sea sick, this wouldn't be the place for you. visited the place after it rained and it was very rocky.That being said, the food was really good. Definitely recommend the chicken enchiladas and the chicken chimichangas!

Great tasting food however extremely slow service and many items a group ordered either did not come, came in the wrong order, or something else arrives that we did not order. Not sure if we had a new hire server however when spending that sort of money spent at this restaurant we expected better service. Waited 25 minutes for the bill in the end had to go up to the counter and pay as we had another engagement after our dinner
4
rather gimmicky restaurant but luckily the food was solid. got the beef fajitas and damn it was good. really beefy and strong flavours, heard their bbq ribs are not bad too
4
The ambiance was wonderful. Food was tasty enough. Only thing we didn't quite enjoy was the boat rocking back and forth. Also, need clear instructions to get to the restaurant. Not easy to find.
5
Great! Service was awesome! Were very generous in recrifying mistake of serving a wrong dish. Staff were very friendly
5
Exceeded our expectations! We had a birthday celebration for my dad and we were given a surprise cake for that day! Serving was fast!!

Enjoyed the food and atmosphere, the service was good with a complimentary dessert for my birthday provided.

Found this restaurant through an app offering restaurant discounts. Selected this for the reasons below : 1. Reasonable pricing2. Tex Mex Cuisine - we were looking for one3. Boasted of a great ambienceWe arrived right on time - it was a bright and lazy Sunday afternoon. Located on the Marina South Pier, there were a few others in the area waiting for their trips to Kusu Island (have decided to have a trip there in the near future).We were ushered in by the staff and were offered a seat next to the window. The restaurant was not very crowded - only a couple of other families. What was different from other restaurants was the fact that we were on a boat and the thing was rocking. I had seen people complaining about the rocking - but didn't they already mention that it's a boat and of course it would be a big let down if it was not on the seaWe ordered a Chips with Salsa ($5), Fisherman's catch of the day ($24), Chicken Fajitas and Chimichuri, Chicken Tacos ($18) alongwih a pitcher of frozen Margarita ($36). The Fajita and the fish was excellent and the tacos were alright. For the Margarita - well it tasted awesome but they could have been a bit more generous with the Tequila.Pros 1. Good Food 2. Great Ambience 3. Nice Service - though the staff appeared a bit lacklustre4. Good value for money with the discount - other wise slightly pricey5. Nice portion size for a Singapore restaurant - may be small for an American Tex MexCons 1. Those with motion sickness should avoid2. Not for those who want to shop and dine in the same trip3. Even though we didn't drive, the carpark appeared small - May be a problem if it gets full4. Those who like it more spicy may have to ask for more chillies - for us it was o

Lovely little restaurant, with good food. Food was reasonably priced - a full rack of ribs cost $32, and was also delicious. Staff were friendly and attentive. Restaurant's in a good location too - it's right next to the Marina South Pier MRT which made it really accessible and easy to get to. Definitely recommend
4
Ordered chicken fajita and baby ribs. Chicken fajita was tasty but could be better if more tortilla is provided (4 tortillas were provided). Baby rib was soft but after sometimes, the sauce become overpowering. Environment was quiet and good. Only complain was the motion of the boat (the restaurant is situated on a old river boat secured to a pier). Due to the way the boat is secured, it got limited motion to the front and side. The effect of this is there will be a sharp knock whenever the boat rock due to passing boats and there's a lot of them. It's like on bus with a bad driver who brakes suddenly and very often. We had to skip dessert due to the rocking motion
5
Excellent experience. Sea was slightly choppy but overall awesome scenery, staff were superbly attentive even though both waiter and waitresses were trainees. And they even provided a birthday surprise with a complimentary brownie icecream cake for the birthday guest! Live band all the way till 9pm and the band performed birthday songs too. Excellent experience and nice ambience. Food maybe arpund 20-30bucls but delicious and good portion for value and ambience. Highly recommended

Stewords Riverboat. ..... I'm not sure whether it was the house salad, the salsa or the rocking boat that made me sick. I visited this place with 3 other friends and we cannot get over the salad dressing that drenched the limp salad leaves. It tasted of the weirdest and most awful combination of BBQ sauce with mayonnaise. The concoction was slathered over the salad as if the kitchen staff cannot wait to finish up the entire stock of dressing. To make matters worse the salad leaves looks like it was bought off the discount rack way past its best before date. If the salad was bad. Wait till I get to the salsa dip. It was made from baked beans mixed with a few chopped pieces of unrecognizable vegetables. A horrifying mix indeed. I will swear off salsa forever if everyone made it this way!! All this while the boat was doing a fair bit of rolling. It was 7pm and boats were just returning to the passenger jetty adjacent to this floating restaurant. We had a terrible time trying to hold our food down. The ONLY Saving grace was the polite and pleasant young Indian lady who is the assistant floor manager. She reassured us that the boat will settle down once the peak hour is over. But ..... we couldn't wait for that. We left soon after speaking to her, not finishing our food. Never again will be be eating at this place!! The decision was unanimous.
3
The overall ambience and service was good. However due to the constant moving of the boat, it's not very recommended to people with motion sickness as it can get quite bad.
3
Steak was nice, but the turkey slider from kids menu was really bad.. It's cold and the ham/meat was purple....
5
Food good price good only thing sea sick people cannot eat cause is really inside sea and can be quite shaky due to waves
4
Experienced having dinner with the Waves hitting on the floating Boat. Initially it was a little giddy, the conversation and interaction made us forgot the waves.
3
The pork ribs were so-so; as such it was a letdown when I was expecting something better than Tony Romas' :(
A rocky experience actually, given this eating place is anchored by the bay. Not really comfortable for dining in my opinion!
5
Good food good at atmosphere good service reasonable price affordable not pricey food portion is big
4
First visit here and I must say that I wasn't prepared for the constant rocking of the boat with me on it. Fortunately it was made bearable by the attentive service provided by the wait staff. Definitely worth a 2nd visit!
3
Great ambience and service crew was wonderful.
Book early to avoid disappointment.
But i suffered from diarrhoea after i dined at the restaurant. Hope it wasn't due to the food. I still wish to recommend my friends to this wonderful dining place.

Years back, in 2002, I tried the food of santafe tex-mex grill at the outlet in Clark quay. In the year of 2003 (if I remember correct) they closed that outlet and stated the restaurant at this river boat. This is a 3 deck river boat parked at the shores of the sea at marina south pier. Just 2 minutes walking distance from the MRT exit B. This is the least crowded MRT station in singapore. On 24-6-2007, I decided to try this restaurant after 15 years from my previous experience of their Boat Quay outlet. I got Fave voucher for approx 50% off. Ordered buffalo wings, chimichangas and quesadilla as the starters. Surprisingly, the taste kept same over these 15 years. All these items are authentic tex-mex flavoured. As main course, we ordered beef fajita, blackened beef burger. Really delicious. Tried frozen margarita, root beer float, sundaes and the cheese cake in the jar. All items are highly satisfying. Service crew are polite and service oriented. They provided us the best sea viewing seats. They have live music performances. Evening view of sea while having the great food is a wonderful experience. Boat is rocky occasionally because of the waves. As we are not prone to motion sickness or sea sickness, it was an enjoyable experience. Neat and clean toilets too. Any way, value for visiting and having food in this wonderful place. Will go again with friends.

We loved the mignon tenderloin we had in our last few visits. Now they have changed the menu. The tenderloins are of low grade and for a medium rare doneness it was already very tough. Alm the whole steak got to be spat out. The taste also deteriorated from the way it was done in the old menu. House salad at $17 was a small portion. Taco was nice. Waiters were polite.
4
Dinner date at Santa Fe Tex-Mex Grill. Dinner on a boat was a new experience, food was good and location is actually very accessible by MRT.
5
The waiter and waitresses were really nice and the food was good too and I really peaceful view of the sea..Loved the ribs! Sadly we couldn't stay long as I got seasick after awhile as it was pretty rocky! But that's only for me
1
The valentine dinner was so terrible. The food totally not worth the money. Nothing special for the valentine dinner menu and it cos me nearly $200 for couple meal. The amount of wine serve in each table is different. Overall very disappointed in the food

Visited with family. The ambience is fine but not great. There was live band. Food portion was medium sized and quality medium high. I had Groupon coupons, overall okay.
1
Went for their event/buffet for Mother's day - Around the World on Mother's Day on 14th May 2017. With the price of $45++ i could get way better quality and variety of food at a decent hotel. Only drinks available are tea and coffee. Not even ice water is being serve or fruit punch? Live carving station of beef is tough and dry, Salmon is way too salty. Dessert making section - Eclair filling and the red bean for the cendol is hard. Rojak is mediocre too. The better food are the churros, tacos and potato gratin. Live band only started at almost 730-8pm (they are good though), when we are done with our food (reservation at 6pm). Would be good if they state the performance schedule - would have book at a later timing. Suggest to try visiting during their normal operation days where they serve ala carte menu and avoid their "special event". But don't put in too high expectation - as I suppose they all come from the same kitchen. Service was good but I don't think i will ever revisit as I get nausea - after 10 mins of seating (thats just me, my parents were ok

Santa Fe Tex-Mex Grill (Stewords Riverboat) Santa Fe Tex Mex Grill is a casual-dining family restaurant that specializes in serving authentic Tex-Mex cuisine. it is an Americanized version of Mexican food.The service is awesome! When we arrived at Santa Fe, we were warmly greeted by the awesome service crews and were shown to our dining table.Server was attentive and recommended some dishes. Also checked on how the food was and recommended the best seating area with the best sea view. The dining ambience of Santa Fe Tex-Mex Grill is extremely cozy and homely, definitely a unique and special place for dining. We ordered quite a number of dishes to share with one another, we had Cheese Nachos, Chicken Chimichangas, Turkey Quesadillas, and Buffalo wings for appetizers and they are oh so yummy! For main grilled chicken breast is spread with BBQ sauce and topped with bacon and melted cheese. Served with mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables, and finally The Blackened Salmon Veracruz its very flavorful dish that tantalizes the taste buds. Coated topside with crusted black pepper, the salmon fillet is then pan-fried and served with spicy rice and grilled vegetables with tomato compote. Truly, we had an enjoyable time dining at Santa Fe. Though the pricing may be slightly on the higher-end, the dining experience is one that you will find unique, special, and ideal for that one special moment. If you a prone to seasick easily, then you might want to consider popping some seasick pills before going onboard because the occasional waves from the surrounding sea vessels would send the riverboat rocking from side to side. Anyhow what impressed me most is their service, which was extremely well-delivered and way exceed our expectations. Other than the fantastic customer service, I really like the venue, I Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon

last Sat nite, had a dinner gathering at Santa Fe @Riverboat. Easily accessible by public transport - Its a Marina South Pier MRT station.nostalgic feeling as you are dining in an old steam boat, its a replica of a Mississippi steam boat.Baby back rib is tender and juicy. very nice dips with the nacho chips, we had the seven layered party dips (mixture of gaucomole, sour cream ...), chicken is also tasty and moist. the Chilean wine which we had, are reasonably priced.overall a nice place to relax, chit chat, watch the sunset. they had a 2 pc band for some light singing entertainment
5
Love the BBQ Baby Rack Ribs, Ribeye Steak, Turkey Quesadillas. Only the Grilled Chicken was not pleasing to our palate. My teenage kids love the coke and sprite float too. The fries and mash potato were yummy too. It was a Sunday lunch, ambience were serene and pleasant. As the riverboat rocks afloat the sea, my girl was a little sea sick after the meal. Overall a great dinning experience

We had a family lunch here using the groupon voucher lunch deal- 14.90 for soup and maincourse or 19.90 for 1/2 rack riband wine. The service was pleasant and food of a decent quality. The ribs were tender and fall off the bone-served with chips and salad and a good sized portion. The soups were tasty and the maincourse of blackened burger and pan fried tilipia were also of a good standard. The wine was also not cheap plonk and very drinkable. The location is easy enough to get to on the MRT and would be a nice venue for an evening meal. Yes the boat does rock a bit but we didn't find this to be too much of an issue. Would happily eat here agai
3
I ordered 2 sets of full rack pork ribs. They were done too dry. The meat was also not marinated enough. I have eaten here on 7 other occasions.The service remains good. But with a falling standard of food. The boat was wavering exceptionally with the tide too at the front part of the boat which usually is better.
4
The staff was very kind and they gave me a very good seat facing the sea. Dont go if you will get sea sick very easily. The boat is very shaky
4
The ribs were pretty ok. Whiskey flambe probably isn't as good as it sounds.
Service is sub par, though. Takes a while to get their attention, seems like the waiters were over stretched.
4
Service, atmosphere and food were good and value for money. But may not suit people who tends to get seasick.
4
Food was great especially the back ribs. It was so tender. Wine was good too. Service was average and could be better. If you want a quiet weekday lunch, this place is perfect.
5
Baby back ribs were succulent; the meat peeled off the rib bones easily and was cooked just nice.
Nice location for a change.
4
Had the baby back ribs which was quite good but potato skin was bit expensive. Buffalo Wings wasn't that spicy. Parking was expensive though.

First time to this restaurant. Booked and went for Valentine Day Dinner. Feel that were not able to cope, serving were slow. Price were too high for their compulsory 5 course meal on Valentine. Plain bread and small glass of sorbet also consider as part of the 5-course meal. Little disappointed. They can do better than this...

My GF and I had our first visit to Santa Fe Tex-Mex Grill on Stewords Riverboat on 4 Feb 2017. It was very accessible by MRT - simply go out by Marina South Pier Exit B, and you will not miss it. We purchased Groupons for BBQ Baby Back Ribs with Wine, so we found our dinner very value for money. The portion was generous, and came with salad and fries. The full-rack ribs tasted good with BBQ Original sauce (very rich in flavour) and Chipotle Honey-Glaze sauce (a little bit spicy). We chose Shiraz and Chardonnay to go with our meal.We were pleased with the ambience - quiet with few diners. The boat did rock quite a fair bit with the evening waves, but was stable as the sky got darker. After our dinner, we explored the upper decks and enjoyed the views amidst in night breeze.The staff were patient, polite and prompt in their service. By using Groupon, we didn't have to pay any service charge or GST

Groupon for 2 at Tex Mex for full slab of baby back ribs and wine. 6pm on weekday, very few diners so was in quiet settings. Restaurant played nice oldies and air conditioned. Service was prompt and the meal came out in quick time. The ribs was good, not too dry. Came with fries and lettuce & dressing. Wine + mug of ice water.After dinner, walk around the boat, up the decks & had a nice view of evening skyline of Singapore flyer and Bay Sands at a distance.Overall good experience. MRT station is only 1 min walk.The boat does rock quite abit, so need to get use to it. Those with seasick tendencies, DO not attempt! Come for dinner & stay a little for the evening breeze and night shots taken on the boat

Went with a groupon Chop on board promo, for two, dinner on tuesday evening. we were the only couple there at 6pm, a few more tables were filled up by 7pm or so. Had the morrocan skewers (6/10) , beer batter fish (8/10), sausage platter (6/10), calamari (5/10),. The fish is very worth it, nice portion and tastes great.ambiance is ok, can be improved. the spot lights on the dining tables could be adjusted to tilt slightly away from the table (glaring). Service: Was a bit worried after reading the reviews here but i must say service was prompt and friendly. The Indian bartender was very accomodating and the filipino wait staff excellent. good job.Boat rocks as you eat, may cause slight discomfort until you get used to it. View is pleasant. Deck can be wet with puddles of water here and there, this could be improved. perhaps the deck can be fitted with nicer flooring to give a better ambiance, but not a deal breaker.Won't mind coming back again for the Fish and the skewers. We paid using Groupon voucher and therefore found the price paid to be very worth it vis a vis the food/ service/ setting. Food portions are more than enough for two big eaters (we struggled to finish everything). At full prices, one may need to be a bit picky to sort out the good value eats. i think the skewer platter and beer fish to be pretty worth it.Avoid the calamari.. not worth it."honey" Mustard sauce that came with the sausages was a bit runny, we preferred the plain old mustard.The downside: stayed for 3 hours plus and got a shock.. Parking $10 bucks!!!!! And there is no where else to park. Get the parking sorted out, guys

Very nice atmospheric boat - but it goes up and down just slightly so don't get sea sick. Main place to eat if you are going to take a boat though as not many other places inside the pier place. The range isn't very wide but the portions are really big so good value. Very tasty because loads of heavy marinade for all the meats etc - typical Tex mex
1
got a groupon - did not know what to expect - ordered badly i guess and waitress was not helpful or forthcoming, the nachos were covered with some yellow sauce that looked very processed, the accompanying guacamole and salsa tasted like they came from a jar/ ready made mix. the fries came without condiments, the chicken was over marinated and the blue cheese sauce did not taste of blue cheese. the staff did not have customer service experience and the manager neither. had diaorreha the next morning . only the view to mbs is nic
3
We visited the Wood & Steel Gastrobar at the upper deck on the boat and the experience was quite good. We made reservations thru the eatigo app which was convenient and offered good discounts on the food items. The seafood platter and pizza we had were quite tasty and good. However, there are much room for improvement for the snack bites like fries and wings. Prices are also quite steep without discount. Also ensure that you do not have seasickness..
2
Went to the place over last weekend.bought a voucher for the steak set.1) customer service unpleasant: made a reservation but was told couldn't find the reservation and had to wait for a bit (even though it was not full) for the table. Asked for water and didn't get till I had to ask again. Couple beside us who came after we did got theirs. another customer behind us was complaining that they waited very long for their drink order. Staff were very confuse on their duties. Could tell the staff were trying hard to provide good service but could tell that staff didn't know what they are doing.Food: Food came more than 30 mins later, was disturbed when they asked if we did order another dish which was actually ordered by the couple beside us. Food was no longer hot and done-ness of the steak was like rare more than medium rare. Other than that food was fine.Throughout the whole meal could see customers streaming in with reservation but no tables. which was what happened to us earlier. Since it is in a boat docked on sea, could cause some nauseating effects for some. Rather rowdy place as it gets crowded.Overall customer's experience with the staff could be improved but the negative first impression I got wont warrant a revisit

The restaurant is set on a ship which park in the sea. So, be sure that you or the person you are bringing able to stand the sea floating. We went to the Wood & Steel Gastrobar which is located on the 3rd upper deck (most top) of the ship. We need to make a reservation 2 weeks in advance because they are "always full" whenever we called. So, when we were there, they are not full at all. They have 12 tables which can accommodate 4 person per table surrounding the side and 4 tables that can accommodate 6 person in the middle. Kinda big place actually. There were several tables still available when we visited on a Friday night which we supposed is a chillax night for most of the people.It took almost 15 minutes for the waiter to come over and took our order. Even though we had called them twice to take order. Food was served relatively fast. There is a sign that it will be free if they don't serve the food within 25 minutes (Not sure when it will be remove). For pricing wise, I would say $30-$50 per pax for a main course and a drink. The portion for the main course is small which you will not full. We saw the other table ordered "a sharing portion" course which is quite decent. So maybe can try that. Overall, a good ambience as it is very windy and you get to view the MBS, Gardens by the Bay and seaview. Food is nice but not the service
5
This review is for Wood & Steel, which is located on the top deck of the boat, above Santa Fe. Both of them are part of Stewords Restaurant.Great location. The boat top restaurant is an unique experience. You can see the MBS, Gardens by the Bay, Singapore Flyer etc from the tables while the strong ocean breeze keeps you cool. The rocking boat makes it even more fun. Moreover, the food is really good. We a Little Lamb had Mary and Hail the King, and especially the Lamb was just too good. Highly recommended
4
got a groupon, wasn't expecting much but am very pleasantly surprised. Staffs were most welcoming, doesn't treat you like groupon cheapos. Very attentive service, very polite servers, food was good. Seafood platter was complete with 2 king prawns, squid, salmon, dory, veg with tastefully done miso sauce. Pleasant enough to warrant a second visit, chop on board grilled lamb with raspberry sauce was so tasteful they prob marinated the marrows, ribeye chunks with blue cheese was interesting combination. Parking is $2 per 1hour, $2 for second hour, not part thereof. So you can can't finish within the hour, stay for 2hrs to admire the sea-nery
1
Bought groupon voucher. Tried making reservation and was told is fully booked even for the next couple of weeks. In the end they manage to squeeze me in. Went there that day and it was not full at all, there are still plenty of empty seats.Sat down and was told that Salmon and King prawn are out of stock and will replace dory fish and tiger prawn instead. Which i'm fine with it. Then i saw the next table ordered ala carte and they had king prawn. When i question them they say the ocean platter for today were all changed to tiger prawn because alot of customers gave feedback that only 2 king prawn is not enough. If this is the case they should explain that instead of telling me no more king prawn. At least i should have my choice to choose if i want king prawn or tiger prawn.Service was good no doubt but they are just not honest.
4
The baby back ribs flambeed with whiskey and Louisiana hot sauce are nicely done. Meat is tender and delicious. Lettuce is crisp and fries are nicely done. Portions are sufficient. Service staff are friendly and polite. It is walking distance from the Marina South Pier mrt station and a short walk from Gardens by the Bay. It is a unique experience in a cozy environment if you are not prone to motion sickness as the boat rocks during the entire dining duration
4
I made reservation so I got really nice seats with seaview which i was so appreciative of. When stepping into the place, its literally a boat so it does get kinda shaky with the tides which was abit uncomfortable to dine with. However it was such a great experience as the place is super cozy and nicely decorated so we felt so relaxed.The food arrived promptly and we got two of the baby back ribs, honey glaze tastes great just nice but the whiskey flambe can be alil bit thick on the sauce. Salad however is overwhelmed with the vinaigrette so we didn't touch it after a bite.Slightly disappointed when i asked for a wine recommendation, the young waitresses just replies that shes 16 and she doesn't know wine which is reasonable but there wasn't any follow up to get an experienced staff to attend to me.Overall the place is very beautiful, food looks great! Very unique kind of experience and service was good. Had a really great night ^

When with a friend for dinner around 7.30pm not busy .at that time about 7 table.Service was fast .They have a Guinness 1 for 1 free .Portion for the food was big.We have the Ribs and fajitas .it was delicious. strong recommend cheer

When I lived in Singapore, I really loved to come to this restaurant not only for magnificent view and delicious food but also for personalised service and friendly atmosphere. Nachos and All American burger is a must try.

But its a good place to chill, away from the city buzz. Gathering with friends for drinks is ideal. As it on a boat, it can get bumpy.

The Wood & Steel Gastrobar may or may not be affliated. There is much publicity online but reviews warned that the waiting time is at least one hour for dinner. I arrived early by one-hour before my guests to place the order thinking that it would be alright, only to discover that they were backlogged by one hour already, with many customers chasing for their orders at the cashier. The cashiers could not speak English well and had difficulty understanding and entering the orders for the kitchen. Be prepared for a waiting time of 2 hours before dinner is served on weekends. I believe this resulted in only one sitting for dinner as we observed, since it took almost 30 mins for each order/ platter to be served one at a time (there were 9 of us!). Almost every other table was complaining and my guests were famished. The platters for 3-4 persons specified on the menu was only enough for only 2, and the food was all cold, dry and hard, not to mention overpriced. The king prawns weren't too fresh either. The band that was to play on the night of 12 December 2015 had a member named Andrew on guitars who showed up very late making it impossible for the band to start. The drummer was also joining the band for the first time. If it rains, since this is the top deck, the deck does not drain well and floods. Since there were only 3 waiters, aside from the manager and bartender, two staff were busy mopping the deck so that guests would not slip, especially with so many of us shuffling back and forth following-up on our missing orders. I had a question posed to me by my spouse, wondering if the food was actually cooked at the Tex-Nex Grill below deck and served to us on the top deck or perhaps ordered there and plated on the top deck?

This restaurant is by far serving the best BBQ back ribs that I know.. It's amazingly soft and great.The chicken was cooked to perfection and they really take into consideration on the family or guest profile..Wine selection and drinks is good too.Service was prompt by the Indian gentleman over... Food service was pretty quick and the ambience is really great for family or friends hanging out by the sea.. I recommend visiting during weekday dinner where the restaurant isn't too pack and is peaceful... Do give this place a visit once...The indoor seating is comfortable and so are the lightings that allow great feels.I loved the food and serviceZDo give

We came here on a Saturday for lunch. The restaurant was not at capacity.The service was just the worst. The food was mediocre to insulting. Also note that this restaurant is in a boat that bounces up and down on the waves. Not recommended, but really not recommended if you get motion sickness/sea sickness.List of offenses: Drink orders were not delivered for nearly 20min. The waitress said we could mix the taco plate and get a chicken taco and a fish taco. Even repeated the order. An order of chicken tacos was brought out. Some significant time later an order of fish tacos also came out. And they acted like it was our fault.No food was delivered for nearly an hour. I'm really not sure why we stayed that long.An order of nachos consisted of exactly four pathetic nachos chips that look to have been microwaved with cheese on them. These four chips cost $9.Multiple orders for more drinks were made and not delivered.Food was brought out maybe one plate every 10-15min or so. Pretty much nobody ate at the same time in our party of 6.After an hour and a half, and after repeatedly asking for it, our last 2 orders of fish and chips came out.I have no idea why our food took so long to come out when the restaurant was not at capacity. Please do not go here. The staff is incompetent and uncaring

Visited on a Sunday evening. Only one other table was occupied so there was a lack of atmosphere. In retrospect it may be best to go here earlier to benefit from the views, and perhaps the restaurant would also be a little busier. Service was fine, we ordered wine from the menu but also tap water, which was served quite quickly (no charge for the tap water thank goodness). We were using a Groupon voucher which was sold on the basis that a normal charge of SGD 70 applies for the one pound fajita. In fact a chicken/beef fajita (which we shared) costs considerably less at the regular menu price, and less again if using one of the promotions available on a walk-in basis. Even the most expensive fajita (seafood) does not cost SGD 70 at the menu price incl. GST and service. So we felt we'd been duped at the outset. We would not have bought the groupon voucher if we had known its true value. Unfortunately, the quality of the food did not appease us. Not enough wraps and the accompaniments portions were small. Worse.... Totally flavourless beef and chicken. Surprised this restaurant survives given Singapore's justifiably high food reputation

The first view of the restaurant is stunning – a Mark Twain era steamboat? Docked in the South pier at Singapore? Surreal. The rocking made me lose my bearings. Hello seasickness. But the warmly lit interior of the restaurant on the boat’s main deck is comforting and I slowly get used to the swaying and my insides settle down. Coming to the food. Mushroom soup (****) and vegetable tacos (****) and a side order of grilled veggies (****). Enchiladas (****) and fajitas (****) and tacos (****). Everything is fresh and flavourful. Finally a cappuccino (****) that’s better than anything in a coffee chain! More at arunsikka.blogspotcom.What’s the downside? The upside – location – is also in some ways a downside. A long last mile! From Marina Bay MRT bus no. 402 – infrequent – or a longish walk if you don’t want to take a taxi
