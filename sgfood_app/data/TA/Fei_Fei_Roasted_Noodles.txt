This title "Fei Fei Roasted Noodles" is inaccurately named, & misleading.Noodles are never roasted!It should be named "Fei Fei Wanton Noodles", or "Fei Fei Roasted Pork Noodles". Wanton noodles is the more accurate name.The only roasted thing in this noodle dish is the Chinese roasted pork slices, known as "Char Siew" in Cantonese

This stall opens at 10am and you'll see a queue forming already, for just $3 you'll get a hearty plate of wanton noodles. The noodles is springy and the main highlight would be the bbq pork - char Siew. Very tender and flavorful, it's sweet and crispy on the edges.. Also comes with a bowl of soup with shrimp wanton. Soup is a bit salty and overall very enjoyable.
