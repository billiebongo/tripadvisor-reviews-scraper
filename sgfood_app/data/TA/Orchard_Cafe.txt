We stayed in the Hotel overnight and thought it a good idea to experience the Buffet Breakfast before starting our sightseeing. The choise and quality of food was exceptional and we would highly recommend.
4
Good ambience. Good to go early since they won't really top up near the end. The chilled prawns are really fresh, juicy and huge. Cakes are so-so, only the cheese cake left an impression. Overall a good lunch place for buffet!
4
Good service, good food and ample portions but not cheap. There were three Dining areas if I remember.
4
Fabulous array of international cuisine on display, the food was fresh and extremely well presented, all dietary needs catered for, staff on hand to explain the various dishes. Would recommend eating here.
3
Food is average but cost is very high. Staffs are not friendly. You better order your food in the room.

First try of orchard hotel buffet dinner, service was pretty good. Price range after service charges slightly over $80/pax.Food wide not a lot of variety. If you craving for seafood, the seafood ice mountain provide fresh oyster, mussel and claim~( i saw some review showed crab and lobster, probably only available on weekend~~not sure).There is 2 live station, sashimi and satay. And Salad/dessert corner.Dessert was quite impressed, lots of choices and the durian paste is the best among all. Family and business meeting friendly
5
Was the first to arrive .. staff patiently brought me to table.. as the food is not ready.. staff told me to wait 5 min... as I was busy with my mobile.. staff came to me and say food is ready... Variety of food was aplenty... food was top up promptly... clearing of plate is promptly too..Never know this hot buffet was so good... comparable to aquamarine... Had turkey.. baked ham... Japanese section... satay... pasta cook on spot...

Orchard Cafe offers a good range of fresh seafood, ranges from lobster( fast in topping up ), clam, mussels, oysters n prawns. The staff r fast in refilling the seafood. They offer Japanese sushi n sashimi too. The desserts are nice too especially durian purÃ©e. They have roast piglet as well. They provide complimentary Birthday slice of cake too. Thumb up for their fast clearing plate, refill n good service.

The Orchard Cafe is one classic cafe that doesnâ€™t disappoint. It offers a good mix of local delights of all kinds including Chinese roast duck, roast pork, chicken rice, laksa and so much more. The best are its satay and its durian dessert. And so are it roast beef and grilled lamb chop well done. Itâ€™s fresh seafood variety may be limited but itâ€™s variety, thereâ€™s always something you can enjoy.I would like to commend Peggy and colleagues for being attentive to our 7-month baby. Duly bringing the baby chair and kidâ€™s bowl and utensils, while asking us if we need to change to table with sofa seat
3
The breakfast spread is quite a bit with European, Japanese, Chinese and Indian items on the menu. However, was not impressed with the taste of the food. At the same time, service is quite poor with the person who was escorting us to a table got angry when we did not agree to her suggestion for a table.If you are staying at Orchard Hotel, then you do not have a choice otherwise would simply avoid it
4
Utilised the 1 for 1 UOB Cards promotion for the lunch buffet. Enjoyed the fresh prawns, clams, and mussels. The satay was to die for and the noodle bar had extensive condiments. Will recommend to friends and colleagues as a lunch out place.
4
The café is crowded with people. I thought they had average variety of food selection. However, on the second day, I found they got more in the café the hotel door. Do look for it if yo will be there.
4
Fairly priced buffet with good choice of local dishes. Nearly always busy so make sure you book. Service is very good.
4
The buffet dinner offers a great selection of dishes including fresh seafood, sushi and roast meats.
Wear loose clothing so you can eat to your heart's desire. The quality of the food is high. Will not be disappointed.
3
Large variety of ethnic foods including Indian, Chinese, Japanese and American. Hot food was served luke warm, food not replaced in a timely fashion when empty. Quality of food was just so-so. If it wasn't included with our room I would not go again.
5
A fabulous menu with either buffet or formal dining options. Breakfast, lunch or dinner all served here by friendly staff.
5
Dinner was awesome We did not have the buffet but ordered a la carteThe pumpkin soup with garlic croutons was outstanding The Nasi Goreng was simply excellent, I have had this dish at perhaps 20 different places but never one so goodSatay , chicken wings, -- v v v goodPrawn fried rice also v v v v goodI would go back for Nasi Goreng
4
I had the buffet dinner with a friend. This restaurant has not only very good seafoods but also famous dishes in China, Indonesia, Thailand and Singapore, such as lobster, oyster, prawn, Laksa, Satay and Thai milk tea. It's a good choice for visitor to try different kind of Asian foods
3
Buffet is pretty decent but food taste is so-so.The sashimi like tuna and salmon are normal, not those top grade in some Japanese buffet.The best item I think is the laksa. Gravy is great!The durian paste however is watery and don't have the creamy taste.Oyster and crabs are fresh.However I am more concern on the attitude of the staffs. Most of them has no smiles and very mechanical.The cashier was worse, as I have a 40% Eatigo discount I check the bill with her as my kids prices were not discounted.She just simply wave me away saying it's like that, only adults entitled to it. When I point out they didn't inform me earlier nor written anywhere, she just ignore me and keep quiet.I have no choice but to walk away feeling disgusted by her attitude.Will never go back again
4
We have no expectation on the buffet as we went for the 1 for 1 deal. I have been to most buffets in Singapore which is quite pricey so Orchard Cafe was a surprise for me, it was fairly priced (for the deal) and there were an ample amount of choices! There were good amount of seafood that we gobbled up the oysters, shrimps, lobsters and fresh sashimi and salmon. The local cuisine was a treat, there were so many choices condiments, add-ons which I was really amazed. The laksa was lovely too. I will surely definitely going to be back :
4
Decent spread for a buffet breakfast with something for everyone. Not fantastic like some other luxury buffets but standard good enough.
4
Ate the breakfast buffet and the high tea buffet at orchard cafe. The spead was good and had a variety of international food to choose from.
5
One of the culinary highlights of the Orchard hotel - with food from every country in the region and beyond - fresh, high quality and something for each persons tastebuds
4
This is good place for breakfast in Singapore
Normal standard as internacional restaurant but in Singapore where difficult to find meal for early birds this place is ok
4
Variety is not a lot, nevertheless sufficient and good spread. Quality of food is good. Value for money.
4
Worth for value, awesome service, remember to like in facebook to enjoy the 1-1 offer, fantastic seafood - cray fish, prawn, sashimi, oyster..........
1
I was there for the high tea last Saturday. I hardly took any food because the quality of food was really below standard - then again I cannot fault the cafe as this is a subjective opinion. But what was most unacceptable is the 'din' caused by the waiter at 5pm when he was re-setting tables for dinner. Did he have to drag each table with such force as to subject the remaining patrons to great annoyance? Two waiters could have handled the table-shifting by lifting the tables instead of dragging the tables. It is as though the staff was deliberately signalling patrons to leave. I left with my friend soon after. The service is utterly unprofessional
4
Been here couple of times for their buffets (Lunch, High Tea) and I do like their variety of food selections. They served the usual buffet items from cold appetisers like prawns, salads to hot items like noodles, rojak, sushi and various cakes, fruits and ice cream for desserts. The only issue I have is during booking when their phone line is forever engaged.
4
This Cafe is located at the lobby level of Orchard hotel. This place is very good fort all day dining. A good spread of breakfast is served in the morning from 6.30 till 19.30. For residents , the price is SGD 36 pp and for outsiders SDG 36 pp. You have large choice of ASEAN, continental and Indian items to choose from. Egg will be cooked to order as per your preference. You can also have other meals. They have very good buffet dinner spread with choice of oriental, Indian and continental spread. For residents , special price is SGD 46 pp. I preferred a la carte. I had fresh watermelon juice and grilled Australian beef. I opted for medium done. It was served with meshed potatoes , steamed broccoli and with pepper sauce. Beef was well cooked. Bread roll came with the dish.
4
We stayed at the Orchard Hotel and breakfast was served at the Orchard Cafe. Buffet style breakfast with cuisine to satisfy every nationality and taste. Good variety of food available and was well presented and cooked. You are directed to tables by staff but then help yourself to what's on offer. Freshly made omelettes are available from the chefs on duty. One adult and one senior citizen offer on at the moment. The restaurant is spotlessly clean and the staff are very friendly
2
Limited spread and no dishes worth recommended. For the same value, there more and better options available elsewhere
4
Limited offerings for vegetarians . I ordered Finger Chips and Cupcakes . The portion size was huge.
4
We were 13 pax and had a family dinner here. Loved the spacious setting. Walk areas great as mum was using the walking stick. Food was good and replenishing was fast. Oysters very fresh compared to other Millenium hotel buffet. Selection was not as huge but sufficient. Only thing the logans were not so good.
2
So because they advertise as offering a mix of Asian food and also the sweet variety that you usually find in western style high teas, we thought it would be a good deal. But not to be...yes, the variety is there but the quality and spread were rather poor.For example, the gravy for the prata (Indian flatbread) was just left to dry under the hot lamp...not refilled or regular stirring of the pot. The 3 steam baskets were of the plainest variety for example, the cheong fun (rice noodle roll) was just blank and with no filling. I would have thought there should at least be siew mai or har kao (steam prawn dumpling).For the ice cream, since there is durian flavored ice cream and everyone knows durian is a love-hate item, there should be standalone scoop for durian ice cream. No matter how you soak the scoop, the taste of durian will affect other ice cream flavours.Everything about the high tea spread, I am sorry to say, were the low cost (and poor quality) variety â€“ we did not even feel like picking up many of the items.In hindsight, I rather pay another $10 to $15 and go somewhere else...
4
The buffet dinner at Orchard Cafe is awesome. They serves a large variety of food. Quality of food served is good and fresh. Price of buffet is worth for the variety of food and they served oysters and lobsters. Great place for gathering.Do check out if they have any credit card promotion. Quite good deals at times
4
Ordered via Groupon the noodle 3-course set lunch. I chose the chicken and black fungus. My lunch companion chose the prawn and spicy miso noodle. The noodles were delicious with a rich flavourful soup. The pork wanton was very tasty. So was the prawn wanton. Excellent meal
3
Went on a Sunday for high tea as I saw they had a Citibank 1 for 1 promotion ($41.20 nett per pax) which was value for money. A good selection of local delights for high tea which includes chilli crab dip with mantou, porridge, bak kut teh soup, Roti curry, dim sum, sushi, crepes, durian pengat ice cream, mee soto, cakes and pastries, sandwiches, pizza, pasta, prawn paste chicken, chicken rice, salads and more! Juices, coffee and tea included! One downside though, I made a call prior to going down to try to make a reservation but they said they were full and walk ins won't be able to get table as well. Despite this, I still went down to check it out for myself at 2.50pm and...managed to get a table. The place wasn't even full at all! Still had empty tables. So I'm not sure why they didn't want to accept my phone reservation.
4
Had two lunches and a dinner in this restaurant - all buffets. Food was consistently good with a good amount of variety. They also had yam and durian ice-creams (the durian to be served with a separate spoon!), both of which were definitely a first for me. The sushi counter was good. I tried laksa for the first time and liked it. A couple of locals who were with me during the meals said it was one of the best around
3
@TheKuoKnowsThere are times when Orchard Cafe can be outstanding. Then there are those days when it falls on the wrong side of mediocrity.The sushi counter is a good example. With a good sashimi chef at the helm, the servings of raw fish can be a treat. But with the knife in the hands of an unremarkable cutter, the lack of finesse can be disappointing.The Indian section is consistently good, though. The choices might be limited. But what is on offer is exciting. So too is the choice of local noodles. On some days it could be Mee Siam, while on others it might be Mee Rebus. Good comfort food.The desserts can be a tad underwhelming. Perhaps a little tender loving care could be all that is needed to breathe some life into the listless array of sweets in the chilled cabinet. The fruit platter could do with an injection of sparkle too.On balance, Orchard Cafe does just enough to satisfy. But a satisfactory grade is not quite good enough, when diners are paying top dollar

We ate at Orchard Cafe last evening to enjoy the 1-for-1 promotion for buffet dinner. The international spread included Waygu satay, Kuih Pie Tee, laksa, sashimi and sushi, rojak, indian dishes, local dishes (chili crab, fried beef in osyter sauce, salad, desserts (fruits, cake, ice-cream, creme brulee), seafood (oysters, mussels, prawns, lobster) and meats (kurobuta pork belly and beef). Food tasted OK - as expected for a cafe in a hotel of this grade. My main gripe was the kitchen did not refill the dishes even though there was very little food left in the serving crockery even though it was nowhere near the close of buffet dinner time - We felt that the cafe was rather tardy in this aspect. I don't see this happening at the Line, ShangriLa Hotel or the Marriott Cafe, Marriott Hotel. In fact, we had to ask the kitchen to refill one meat dish and were told by another guest that he had to ask the kitchen to bring out more of the Signature Mango Cake. Where we sat, we were occasionally disturbed by the banging noise when the chef made his handmade noodles at the nearby Noodles Bar
4
The meal is nice and service is fine. Location of the hotel is good and worth it with the promotion.
5
Café with different kind of food. Desserts were fantastic. Customer Services were too good. Planning to dine in again.
5
We had an evening meal here on our first night in Singapore. The Nasi Goreng was excellent.
Daily breakfast was superb with great choice and friendly staff.
4
We ate here during our one-night stopover in Singapore, staying at The Orchard Hotel. Our meal was very pleasant and well presented. Recommended.
5
Excellent choice if you like Dim-sums...very small menu, but delicious! particularly if you don't fancy a full meal....and all homemade by the chefs here in front of you!

The Orchard Cafe, located in the lobby of the Orchard hotel, serves a buffet with excellent local delights everyday for lunchtime. Their seafood is fresh, whether in sashimi or the raw oysters,, mussels or prawns, their Thai spicy salads are authentic without being too spicy, the laksa is as good as a laksa can be in a hotel and you can adjust the spiciness by adding chili paste and the pie tee excellent. You can basically enjoy all the hawker food delights but in the nice setting of an air conditioned cafe inside a hotel and without limitations as to the quantities and variety except the capacity of what your stomach can take. A good option if you want to try the various local delicacies in a nice setting and at a reasonable price
4
We went for buffet dinner on a weekday and it was pretty packed. The spread including good selection of fresh seafood was pretty good, though the lobsters tasted very bland and the oysters were a mixed bag - some really good and some were not fresh. Other selections including sashimi and asian cuisine. Liked the durian ice cream as dessert. Service was nonetheless good even with the crowd as they were attentive to requests and quick in clearing plates on the table. When the bill was called for, the waiting staff was very helpful in priorly informing us the best prevailing promotions and we settled with the 1-for-1 card promotion
5
went there with family and most recently with a big group of friends for dinner...the spread was value for the price we paid...best to go is during the 1 for 1 promo...free parking for dining there as well was another plus...location was on the outer part of orchard no need to enter erp if u know where to come from.

As another reviewer said. 'What makes one breakfast buffet stand out from others?' I suppose it must be difficult as they're all pretty much the same. I appreciate eggs the way I like them, and this breakfast has a range of natural cereals, grains and nuts which I like. But the one thing that stands out is the way they pack people in to the large space. I really don't like sitting right next to someone I don't know while I eat breakfast - or lunch or dinner. A restaurant that seats people this way will never get a high rating from me.
5
I had a 13 hour flight into Jakarta, slept for about 3 hours and flew to Singapore for about 5 hours before flying back to Jakarta. As usual the staff fell over backwards to help me and give an outstanding service.  My sincere thanks go to Jane on the Executive Floor and Lewis for his amazing ability to conjure a Taxi out of thin air in time to catch my flight. This year I will be based in Jakarta and guess what, for a long weekend I will be back.....
4
What makes one buffet better than another - possibly a wider selection of choice? Again, plenty of prawns, oysters, sushi but you also get laksa, curries, noodles and an interesting array of desserts
5
Great staff and very accomodating for customers who have food allergies. Ibrahim the manger was very accomadationg
4
The quality and authentic of the local fare on offer was excellent. Mee siam, satay, pie tee and prawn noodle soup were all exactly how I liked them. I would highly recommend this place although it seems a bit pricey at $80 per head.
3
Too crowded and bad food quality. Food quality average. Rude staff and no helping or guiding. Poor Service and cleanliness of Cuttleries. Less choice for Vegetarians.
4
I was happy with the service and the choice was amazing and diverse. The staff friendly and the facilities clean. $48 for breakfast was over priced.
3
The Cafe is operated by the ORCHARD HOTEL, which is now under the wing of Hong Leong Group, who currently owns the biggest chain of 4-5 stars hotels in Singapore. The location is good , as it is located in Orchard Road. The service is acceptable. The Cafe is more popular for it's buffet. The ambience is acceptable. The choice and quality of food is also acceptable, considering the price charged. Right now the Cafe has a promotion for Seniors on ONE FOR ONE basis. Good and economical place for lunch with Seniors
5
The spread is wide. Chicken rice. Stir fried beef with spring onion, pan fried salmon are a must try. Not to mention oysters, prawns (fresh and large) chilli crabs and sashimi and good desserts.The waitress Sunshine and Pei Pei are very helpful and friendly. They specially gave me a good table because my leg is with a cast so that i didnt have to walk too far from the buffet spread.Very delightful and relaxed dining experience
4
Buffet spread is good, with cold and hot sections.The cold section has oysters, prawns, sushi, sashimi.The hot section has local fares that are of above average standard, with laksa, satay, rojak, fried noodles etc.In addition, the dessert section consisted peranakan kuehs, fruits, soups like the red bean soup.The only compliant I have is the quality of the oysters. I don't know the variety that was used, but each shell only had a thin sliver of flesh
3
Choice of foods are greats... But the services of the staffs there wasn't great... You need to keep asking the staffs there to help us refill the cold water, and the empty plates, they just keep clear one side and the other side they just left it there..
4
This place has improved by quite a bit since the last time that I am here. Business is very good and I am being put on a 20 mins waiting list on a Thursday night.Lots of food variety and great choice in the dessert session. There is currently a durian promotion with a lot of snacks and cakes made of durian. There is durian available outside the restaurant for the buffet goers. I saw the durian fondue but i did not try.Some of the must try are the chilli crab, durian pengat, oysters and ice cream. Price is a bit steep for what they are offering. Good place to go to only if there is a promotion
3
good variety of food to suit all and was buffet style but food was cold/cool which spoilt things for us
5
I am looking forward to dine-in here in Orchard Cafe... Many good food selections and the staffs are approachable.
3
As with any Asian hotel buffet, the Orchard Café excels in its wide selection. However, I was disappointed with the quality of many of its dishes, especially given the ferocious competition in Singapore among hotel restaurants.
4
The selection at breakfast is diverse and abundant, and it is good. Basically anything you want, the restaurant has. The dinner menu also is diverse, and the food is very good.
5
The Orchard buffet is great - with all of the variety across seafood, local delights and Western to choose from.
4
I bought groupon vouchers for this and was really impressed with the excellent value. The service was impeccable and the food plentiful and delicious. The was a wonderful range of seafood and dishes from a range of countries. I would recommend this.
5
Terrific high tea and good value for money especially in SIngapore were prices are very high. There was so much variety to choose from including asian and european food and service was very good
5
Brillant. Great choices. I would go back again. Staff are so friendly and its so convenient when staying in hotel
4
Celebrated my boyfriend's birthday with a buffet lunch at Orchard Cafe on 15 July.At $48** . felt that price is a bit high as durian penget (not the thick type) is served instead of actual durian (which is only available during dinner buffet).Would be better if we could have durian for lunch buffet as well
2
I went for the durian buffet and the Manager by the name of Andy Cheoh, is not friendly. We ask to open a fresh durian and was told by him to take those that are already open. I said those are already dried up as it was left in the open. But his staff was nice to oblige but it seems he is not happy. What kind of service is this???. His staff has to apologies on his behave.
5
Great service given by a young tall skinny filipino guy. He is amazing and very accomodating. His service was really a world class one. Indeed.
5
excellent food definitely come back eat here again. such large range of food to choose from would suit any nationality.
5
The food is great and fresh. Can you imagine the prawns are cooked straight from the tank? That is super-fresh prawns!
5
Offered a variety of choices and very delicious! It is very popular at night that the tables spill out of the restaurant onto what is meant to be a passage way to the lifts.
3
Do try the Nasi Goreng which was recommended (it comes with a sunny side egg, 2 sticks of "satay", crackers and fried rice with prawns).
Chicken rice was a bit bland; guess will be suitable for those who wants something that feels less salty.
2
Orchard Hotel boasts of great F&B outlets like Hua Ting, Orchard Cafe. No doubt food is great but I believe its notorious for its poor service especially the reservation and hotel contact service.I have heard of it before and couldn't believe its even worse to experience it first hand! I don't remember there's another hotel in SG that allow such atrocious telephone contact service to exist for so long
4
Cafe situated in Orchard Hotel Main Floor and easily accessible from busy Orchard Road. Pleasant environment to dine in with good selection of international food including Japanese, Chinese, Indian and Western cuisine. It also provides a good spread of mainly Asian dessert and fruits. Price is reasonable for such a wide selection of food in a high class hotel environment.The receptionist, Vivian Chong is pleasant and efficient in getting a table for us on a number of occasions even though we do not have any booking.Will dine at this restaurant whenever I visits Singapore
4
We catered from orchard hotel for an office event, for about 30 pax, with a Peranakan menuFood was great, service impeccableMenu was authentic with buah keluak (which is not the easiest to do ) , bakwan kepiting, chap chye, ngoh hiang... The otak could have been a tad spicier thoughWhile Orchard cafe is not on my top of mind place to dine will certainly visit after this last experience Compliments to the chef and service staff who worked hard that evenin
5
I was a little hungover from a heavy Friday night and walk up orchard road to find the right cure but could really decide. The I stumbled across a hotel buffet in the Orchard Hotel and that kind of gave me the best of all worlds. It was brilliant and fresh which you normally not always would tag a buffet with. There is everything from fresh prawns . Crab and shell fish sushi salads stir fry's car very and many varieties of Asian delights. Poured down with a few pints of Tiger that saved my day and set me up for an evening return to Sydne
5
Very fast and efficient way of reservation. Instant acknowledgment to let you know if your reservation is accepted. Will definite recommend this to all my family members, friends and business associates. For Orchard Cafe, its was value for money with their 1 for 1 promotion. Food is FANTASTIC! Service is also excellent. Looking forward to have dinner buffet there again
