The best ice cream anywhere in the world! With so many flavours it is so difficult to make a choice. Service was friendly and fast.

Located on level 4 of the ION PLaza we came across Haagen Dazs
It was great. Many delicious flavors and toppings to satisfy our aster dinner quest

Haagen-Dazs is Haagen-Dazs no matter which country you're in. But if you're strolling along Orchard Road in the southeast Asian heat, a scoop or two of ice-cream is a great way to cool off.

HÃ¤agen-Dazs is the best ice cream in the world. Good service with quality food. Must get the experience in there for sure.

Tasted variant flavors of their ice cream. Baileys is my new fave at the moment. Like the way they design the tiramisu. =)

We visited the outlet near the Hilton in Orchard Rd today after having eaten lunch at a nearby restaurant. There's a good selection of icecream and a few sorbets to try, all pretty tasty. Prices are a bit expensive, but sometimes you just have to go for it

I apologise first and foremost for having to write a review on this outlet as I can't find the required outlet on tripadvisor. My son and I visited the Haagen-Dazs outlet along Hilton Walkway at Orchard Road on 31 January, between 4.20-4.40pm. There was only one Caucasian man sitting at the seating area with a take-away cup in hand.The Chinese lady staff member (she's local) manning the ice-creak display counter asked us if we are dining in or taking away because, in her exact words, "there is a different menu for dine-in and what you see here is the take-away menu". We replied that we actually want the scoops of ice-cream on display and not the desserts but we will be sitting there (since we have done so many times in the past 12 years! We go there at least once a month to buy ice-cream and sit there to enjoy our ice-cream). At this point, after hearing our reply, I caught her turning to the manager and rolling her eyes. I let that rude gesture pass. We then ordered two double scoops of ice-cream, stood at the counter for some time while she prepared the order and we continued standing while she keyed in the order at the cash register and processed payment. Upon her handing me the change and receipt, I realised she charged me service charge. I then asked why that is so. Her reply: because you are sitting here. I told her that she did not serve me: she did not seat me, did not go to a table to take my order, did not walk over to send my ice-cream, did not send my bill over and did not send my change over. In fact, I was standing there throughout the order and payment - it was practically self-service. I reminded her that she cannot simply quietly charge people service charge when it's self-service : that is cheating. She shrugged her shoulders non-chalantly and simply returned me $2. From the smirk on her face, I think she did that on purpose. She was probably unhappy that I bought ice-cream from the counter and yet want to sit at the provided seats.First and foremost, that outlet is not a restaurant-it's a cafe just like Starbucks & Coffee Bean-I don't remember these places charging their customers for sitting down. Secondly, there is no sign saying that the seats were only for dine-in customers. Thirdly, we did not stinge on ice-cream: we each bought two scoops - it's not as if we bought one tiny cup to share and insisted to sit there. Fourthly, we have always sat there just to enjoy our ice-cream at least once a month for the past 12 years and the staff have never told us we can't do so or that we have to pay 10% service charge to park our butts on the seats. Furthermore, the place was practically empty and remained empty even when we walked by again two hours later (on a Sunday evening!) Lastly, no staff should quietly charge a customer service charge knowing that the customer had been standing and queuing there for self-service-that's simply cheating. Perhaps Haagen-Dazs at Hilton Walkway should change the description on their receipt from "10% service charge" to "10% sitting charge". I find it truly sad that I had so many nice memories previously at the Hilton Walkway outlet only for those memories to now be shattered by such rude and unethical behavior. What upsets me the most is the rude behaviour of the staff member. I would not have minded if she had politely explained to me the store policy instead of rolling her eyes, shrugging her shoulders and smirking.
