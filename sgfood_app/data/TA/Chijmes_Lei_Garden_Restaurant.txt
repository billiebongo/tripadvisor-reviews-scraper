Quality of Food here is still high. 4-head abalone was huge. The Nian Gao dessert was really interesting with Gui Hua flavours.

Visited this restaurant on 04 February 2018 for a delicious dim sum experience. Food was a very high quality and tasted fantastic. Service was a notch above what is normal in Singapore. What a class act! Definitely recommend this place for Sunday dim sum feasting.

nice ambience; friendly staff; the braised pork in sweet and sour sauce is tasty and chewy; the steamed garoupa is fresh; the deep friend prawn with salted egg yolk is nicely done;

We went to Chijmes Lei Gardens restaurant for our last night of our 3 night stay in Singapore. We were with our son and his partner who were treating us. We were seated outside - inside was full of "locals" so this was, we thought a good sign. However outside only one waiter was allocated with a young man to help - she had to deal with about 10 tables whilst inside there seemed to be numerous staff. In all honesty the food, when it arrived, was really good but oh the wait! One of our orders was Peking Duck which was sent to the kitchen to be carved - forty minutes later it arrived at the table after asking on numerous occasions. We ordered a beef dish to be told 20 minutes later that it was "out" yet was offered it again at the end of the meal!! We asked for the service charge of 10% to be removed from the bill. The setting was great, the food was good when it arrived but the service was very poor. Not a place we will return to if in Singapore again

2 star only for the food, no service for the price we paid for, and staff was definitely not trained.1) When we when in, the staff recommended seafood combination, but after we ordered that, came to informed not available.(why recommend to us at first?)2) We informed to the staff that 1 of us is birthday today, we did not hear anything from she again, we did not hear any happy birthday as well.3) When our Peking Duck served, they only served with the skin(where is our meat?), the staff only mentioned she forgot to ask what we would like to cook for our meat when we asked for it.4) There is no one help taking group photo automatically until we ask for it.Thanks for the nice food, but won’t recommend to my friends to dining there.Management team needs to do something to improve their staff and service standard

I used to dine here very often but not in the recent years, mostly due to a sense of not a place with value for money. This visit was due to a relative from UK who missed the egg tart served here which was considered by us as the best. We ordered a porridge with crab meat (S$48 per portion), one fish maw soup ($48 per head), one fried rice with dry cubic meats ($11) and egg tarts (5 pieces to eat at the restaurant and 6 pieces to take away). Total $151.51 with tax and service charge. The best dish served was the fried rice. It was perfectly stir-fried with the typical wok fragrant. The fish maw served was of very low grade quality (it should be thick and not super thin, slimy and tasteless). The crab porridge was shockingly huge as two whole crabs unshelled were served inside. But we were disappointed that it was stated in the menu as crab meat porridge and not whole crab porridge. The egg tart was a disappointment as it was reheated and not served immediately after baking. It is unlikely that we will visit here again soon but we really would like to thank all the staff who served us with politeness.
5
Sat outside and ordered Dim Sum. I asked they not rush service and they served each plate separately.; it was perfect! Delicious Dim Sum (I lived in San Francisco for over 20 years, so I'm kind of a Dim Sum expert.) Kudos to Serene Low, Asst. Captain, she made sure my lunch was served perfectly!!!

I have been to Lei Garden Restaurant for years and to all their branches (all closed except Chijmes) in Singapore by virtue of a good friend and her family who are regular customers. Hence, you can say that we grew up together with the staff and the restaurant. I only get to go there under their invitation. Yes, I am blessed! : ) Of late, I was there (invited) because of a birthday celebration of the matriarch of my friend's family. Food generally was good and sumptuous. Service is still excellent over the years. They allow doggy bag as there was overflow of food. They cleared our plates after every course and very attentive to our needs. They would separate the portion for us accordingly and do ask if we wanted extra portion if there are extras left such as the shark fins soup. Oops! Apologies to the environmentalists. Would certainly recommend Lei Garden only for special occasion and if one loves quality Chinese food
2
Not my choice of restaurant initially but my travelling companion wanted to try it but she too was disappointed by this.Menu was pricey and the food did not justify the price. The decor was nice and the staff were nice but felt underwhelmed .I wouod not recommend it
4
Very fresh ingredients and excellent taste especially if you enjoy Cantonese cuisine. Service is excellent especially if you book a private room. Each guest is served on small plates. Soups and seafood dishes were excellent. However be prepared to pay high prices at this restaurant. Ambience at Chijmes is good for hosting business clients too. The restaurant will provide complimentary parking, subject to terms and conditions
4
Booked a table for 6 to celebrate the birthday of an old classmate. The food was impressive in terms presentation, colour and taste. The ambience was very nice. The service was fantastic.
4
The food is indeed very good but not extremely special as one would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. Duck was good but not different from other good and cheaper places at Orchard. Staff very friendly and professional.
4
We had a good lunch there before going to the museum. The duck curry was very good. Had a table outside overlooking the gardens.
2
We heard good things about the Lei Garden group in general, so we decided to treat ourselves and dined at this location a few times.The ambience and service are pretty good, however, they are the only saving grace for this restaurant, because the food is below average, and the price is waaay above average.During our first time, we thought it could be a one-time incident, so we headed back the second time. Once again, good was mediocre and service ok, but the price was on the high side.After a long time, we decided to order the Alaskan crab tonight and guess what, it was 360 sgd for 1.5kg of Alaskan crab, which was fine with us, except that it sucked.This is officially our last visit, we can pay for good food but when Lei Garden is just a name without the great taste to back it up, we have to give it a miss from now on.You have been warned
5
Came here for business dinner with my guests and everyone enjoyed it. Service was excellent and food was great. Of cos, it comes at a price as well but it is worthwhile and your guests will be pleased. Good place for business meals.Special thanks for Vivian for the excellent service
3
We were looking forward to an extraordinary meal in a unique setting, at least this is how our concierge described this restaurant. The dining room was underwhelming, really quiet bland. The food was actually very good but no better than a far cheaper Chinese restaurant we had eaten in the previous evening at half the price
5
Only Lei Garden left in sunny Singapore. Quality of food was great & likewise very pleasant staff. Very nice ambiance. Restaurant is located at the heart of Singapore; very accessible by public transportations including subway (City Hall MRT station). For visitors who drive, there’s complimentary parking in basement for 2 hours. Valet parking is SGD13
3
I could swear by this restaurant till a few years back. That took me back to this place again. Dreaming of the food , but was disappointed by the quality. The taste has changed. I really don't like to write negative, but for a place like Singapore you cannot be complacent. So please take this as a positive negative comment
5
We often have lunch at ChIJMes Lei Garden because the round tables suit our business lunch/social dining format. Good for casual meetings over lunch for up to ten people. Upstairs they have private dining rooms for bigger gatherings.The dim sum dishes are very good, with plenty of variety on offer. Service is efficient and attentive, while prices for lunch are reasonable given that this is central Singapore. The location of this particular Lei Garden in the lovely old ChIJMes complex - a restored convent and gardens near the famous Raffles Hotel - is a major attraction too
4
Being a Michelin resteraunt, it has its consistency of quality. We didn’t order those expensive seafood as our European guests are not seafood goers. But the normal meat dishes are well cooked and flavored. The Peking duck is indeed spot on, we regretted to order only half. The staffs are friendly and helpful. And, the price is very reasonable, a bit to my surprise.
5
You should visit this place for Dim Sum and try the Cantonese dishes .
Tasty and good service .
Reservation is highly recommended due to good response for foodie.
5
Location is of top attraction for this Lei Garden. Walking into this colonial complex is a complex feeling to any one.
The dishes are just all too nice. While service attitude is amongst the top 5-star experience.
4
Beautiful Chijmes setting and restaurant. Had a private room with a 10 course menu. Food was not super tasty but very well presented and served. If it wasn't for the ambiance I would have ranked average.
3
Food here are good. Dim sum are also good.
Service depends... when u order expensive dishes, it will be better.
Seafood are very expensive here, so beware.
3
Peking duck was not as crispy as it should be. Soup, fish and abalone was ok. Green vegetables was bland. Rice was really disappointing. Worse of all - the almond dessert (maybe just not my type of dessert). The food lacked presentation. Only Michelin-ness was the service which was attentive - they knew when to replace a hot cup of tea when it became cold. Location is unique but beware the lift next to restaurant entrance - it seems faulty. Hope they can improve
3
We went there for a birthday dinner. The atmosphere is nice and the quality of food is generally good. But we left wondering whether the Star that they earned is on food only.My wife summoned the captain for ordering but she excused herself and attended to other tables. We pre-ordered a soup of the day but was told that it was sold out. However, the soup actually appeared on our table. We ordered a peking duck. The skin was sliced by a waitress instead of the chef. We ordered a claypot rice for 8. It came in two separate claypots and the meat, which was thin and few, was presented in two separate small plates.Might be trivial but to be worthy of a Michelin star, the service and presentation is shockingly lacking
3
I,have tried almost every lei garden there is. This one has much improvement but lots of potential. Great,setting, great sized place with nice private rooms upstairs.They need to cut the prices,down a bit for what is,being served. Either increase the quantity of your dishes or drop your prices,slightly. Secondly could the staff please slow,down on serving out the food!!! It'd not a race. I have to tell every staff member to not serve the next dish until I am ready. I can,see it driving them crazy desperate to serve to all 10 dishes at the same time, their face looks like they are constipated ! Lower the prices / increase portion size, slow down your serving speed it'd not a race, introduce a membership program. Fix those 3 things and things,will definitely improve. Also connect the outside lei garden bar with the inside. Ridiculous how it is,seperate and I can't pay for my bills interchangeably !
3
I have had many good meals at Lei Garden group of restaurants in the region, but unfortunately the recent encounter at their Singapore Branch is not encouraging.We have ordered few common home eating type of dishes to go with rice for our dinner there, the daily special roasted chicken was the best dish that day, the scrambled egg with bean sprout was less than satisfactory, it more like shredded egg toss with vegetables, can't really get the eggy feel of the dish. The vegetables in superior broth is ok.But the show stopper was the bowl of rice, too much water, too wet that the rice pilaf stick together in a lump, told one server about the rice, she nodded but didn't response further, at end of the meal we told the supervisor again when paying, she had a glance and apologised immediately and decided to waive the charges for the rice, that was almost like the highlight of the evening
2
We arrived as a couple with the idea to try their famous pecking duck. From the first moment, we were asked three times by different staff if we would like to order alcoholic beverages.Menus were litteraly thrown at us. After telling them we only wish to drink one glass of wine and order some water, service became unexistant. They even managed to bring me white wine instead of the red I requested. Getting attention from waiters was very difficult and the only helpful lady did not have any knowledge of English. Otherwise food is rather correct. Would definitely not come back. They should improve their service and feel theor customers welcomed.Let's hope the Michelin guide will come back soon to update their thoughts about this place.
1
Went there on the suggestion of friends. Let me say straight away that most zi char restaurants (casual eating chinese restaurants) in Singapore have better food at one quarter the price. The food was ostentatious and ordinary at best. Had their "famous" pekingese duck, roast pork and fish, and was underwhelmed. I've probably eaten these dishes hundred of times in different restaurants, and will never go back to Lei Garden. I don't understand how the bland flavours could please anyone. We had about 10 dishes, and yet we went home feeling hungry. For those wanting good chinese, please find other cheaper places to eat at.
5
Located within the Chimes complex Lei Garden serves great Peking duck and crispy pork belly, the ambience and service match the great quality of food.
4
The Cantonese dim sums are as good as their Hong Kong main store, the Singapore store is more spacious, the har gao almost tastes the same as in HK, the soup is good too. Wifi is a bit weak.
4
This is a classy place with a bit out-of-date ambient. Chinese Food is very good and high quality. We had very classical Chinese food (roasted pork, Deep fried shrimps,... seafood fried rice). Staff is attentive but can be more professional considering the place.
5
First time here but the foods quality were very delicious. Portion was small and a bit pricey. However, the dining room was good, clean and classy. Nice ambient too. Service was very good too. Can't complain about anything.
4
I have been dining out at Lei Garden for the past twenty plus years every time I am in Spore, specifically, at the Chijmes. Food is always good as well as wine. A good variety of wine selection is offered at a reasonable price. Staffs are also attentive
4
Firstly we ordered a Pinot noir and rejected, first time I have ever rejected the wine in the restaurant as it really tasted bad. The roasted pork that is signature dish sold out at 745pm ? The other food is typical Cantonese style and not something special as I expected in Michelin rated restaurant. Ordered marble gory fish that's tasted great and the double boil soup is must when you come to this restaurant. Do try their drunken prawn Shih I think is great with the waiter cooked it in front of you. The private room furnishing is a bit run down and the service staff even wanted to clear my food repeatedly without asking ... a bit disappointing.. overall the food quality is still good but with no expectation as Michelin rated restaurant
5
This a beautiful old fashioned, and I believe authentic Chinese restaurant, set in the lovely Chijmes complex, which used to house my friend's school. It is near Orchard st..We had a lovely selection of dim sum. My favourite what was pieces of pigs trotters with ginger in a black vinegar sauce. We had an amazing selection of flavours in our selection.We had local beers and the service was good
5
Lei Garden has a long reputation of fine cuisine in Hong Kong; the Singapore offshoot carries on that consistency and quality. Furthermore it offered the space and dining surrounding that we felt was more enjoyable than in Hong Kong due to the limited space afforded in Hong Kong - whether in Wan Chai or IFC, which we had also visited.This is a place one would come with the confidence that he or she would have an enjoyable Cantonese dinning experience. The dim sim was delicious and delicate, while on one hand maintaining its traditional techniques, on the other innovating itself with new dishes. It's also one of the few restaurants in Singapore that stock live seafood, for those enjoy freshness of their ingredients. The wine list was comprehensive.Service was friendly and responsive. This may not be a Singaporean restaurant per se but culinary goes beyond country boundaries and this is one of the top Chinese restaurants produces consistent outcomes and dining experiences
4
My brother had his intimate wedding dinner here. The place is cozy and clean. We enjoyed the food especially the pecking duck and Alaskan crab.The waitreses were attentive, warm and polite.A very good place for intimate life events but its on the expensive side.Still Highly recommended if you don't mind spending slightly more than usual
5
Fortunate enough to be invited by friends to this excellent Chinese restaurant on the same day we flew in from London.I'm not an expert in Chinese food, but if I compare to other One Star places around the world, I must say: YES, this restaurant definitely deserves its rating.It's a real gift to eat there. The Peking Duck, the abalone and chicken soup (just the broth is worth ordering this dish), inevitable and delicious dim sums. Everything I could taste was really EXCELLENT, not to mention the dessert: a chilled Mango Juice withâ€¦I'm still dreaming of it
5
Superb place, delicious food in particular sea food, staff is very attentive. Located in central part of Singapore in place with variety of restaurants. For me it is must go place during my visits to Singapore.
4
Really authentic dim sum and the atmosphere and service was really amazing. Food screamed composure and definitely worth the money
4
Hosted a dinner for 35 people from all of Asia and Europe at Lei Garden. Good food and great ambience. All the participants left happy and satisfied. It left them with a great first impression of Singapore's culinary expertise.
5
Great food
Great staff
Location is great. A lot of foreigners also like to come this place
I dine here many times and always a good experience
3
Good was that we were 'walk ins' and they could accomodate us no bother. Also, the food we got was pretty good quality.Bad points, we struggled with the menu and eventually chose a few things - two of which were not available, so back to the confusing menu again....We ordered with little help from staff even though we had a lot of questions. When food arrived, it tasted great although it was tiny portions, therefore quite expensive and we left hungry, but by that time, I'd had enough of the menu.So, my recomendation would be to get familiar with the menu before you go and have a few fallbacks in case what you want is not available - it looks very nice and clean inside so I am sure that we just had a badish experienc
5
The restaurant serves excellent Chinese cuisine. I try and visit the place whenever in Singapore with family. Prices are a bit on the high side but it did meet my expectations. Consult the waiter for suggestions if you are after a particular type of food. I almost always end up ordering a Peking Duck
2
The interior is modern and the staff is very attentive. However if you do not plan to stay indoor, the restaurant selection is extensive in the same courtyard.Once inside Lei Garden, I got the feeling I was robbed. The b.y.o. is serviced by 20 SGD and one half of Alaskan Crab is 450 SGD.After finishing dinner I was hungry and we stopped by a near by restaurant where we had a decent dinner again
4
We hadnâ€™t planned to eat at Lei Gardens because we thought it was too expensive and fancier than we wanted that evening. However, the place we had planned to try was fully booked and the wait was about two hours. One of the waiters was on the outside steps of Lei Gardens when we walked by and encouraged us to sit on the terrace and have dim sum. We were glad we did. The terrace menu is less expensive and the setting is more informal than the inside restaurant. We had a delicious assortment of dim sum and watched everyone wandering around the lovely Chijmes center. It made for a very pleasant evening
5
Had no intention of going here for lunch but glad we did. Everything was first class from the time we were shown to our table to when we left. Ordered off the dim sum menu and with help from staff had some very nice dishes. Would go back to try full menu
4
We are not big fans of restaurants in Chijmes - bad service and food however this is the Exception from when we arrived to when we left everything was perfect. The staff were attentive and friendly, the food was just perfect and the suggestions were spot on. what a difference a restaurant with great service and staff can make to your experience thank you to everyone - we will be back.Enjo
4
Lei Garden's crispy pork dish is one of the best in Singapore and their tim sum ingredients are very fresh. Good food and service, pretty pricey though.
5
Lei Garden is in Chijmes, an easy walk from Bras Basah MRT. Because of the Chinese New Year holiday, the dim sum menu was limited but did not disappoint. In addition to dim sum, we ordered Baked Prawn with Salted Oil Served in Crispy Noodle. To our surprise, we were each served a huge prawn over crispy noodle with tasty sauce. Even after peeling away the shell, the prawn did not disappoint. Also, I appreciated how attentive and helpful the wait staff were in accommodating us even though we didn't have a reservation.
5
 Loved peking duck and double boiled fish soup. Price wasnt cheap although peking duck is very well priced. Quality of food was great. Staff were nice but not all of them spoke well English. Comfy seating and ambient was what I would expect for upper range chinese restaurants. Recommend durian dessert.
4
Went on a Sunday for Dim Sim at lunch time. Very good Dim Sim. Service was very efficient. Not the cheapest 140 SGD for 2 adults and two kids in a group of 16 people (with no alcohol ordered) . Lots of food. They have seasonal dishes that you can try and are quite unique to this place. Parking is cheap and available below the restaurant and therefore the place is very accessible by car even if located downtown.
4
Almost everything I pointed to was out of stock by 9 pm. But what was in stock was very nice too. Good service and unlike many other Chinese restaurants, the staff can communicate in English quite well. A bit over priced - but the food was worth it
4
Chijmes centre near to Raffles has multiple bars and restaurants and you could spend days here eating different styles of food.Lei Garden is in a very traditional colonial style building very close to Raffles hotel. Room layout and service are very high end for a Chinese and suited to business meal or romantic dinner. Menu options are mostly what you would expect but the whole experience was lifted by how well the food was cooked and presented. The Dim Sum was delicious as was the White Soy Chicken. I didn't see a wine list but the wine cabinet had some very, very good Bordeaux wines in stock.Price was around SG$60 per head which seemed value for money for the overall experience. There are hundreds of Chinese restaurants in Singapore where you can grab a quick lunch or dinner I think Lei Garden is where you would choose for a long, leisurely lunch or dinne
4
I wasn't involved in ordering the food during business dinner meeting but the quality (food and service) was good. The Peking duck was amazing and I was surprised it came in the portion that was enough for 5-people without making us full (since the purpose was also to order different food to try on). I also liked the tofu appetiser that cut in tiny cubes, as well as the thousand-year-old egg with ginger pickles. Surprisingly so good
4
In the Chimes Centre the Yard is without the main restaurant of Lei nevertheless the menu is extensive and difficult to review as only a fraction of the offering can be enjoyed at any one time.The setting is lovely and sitting outside on a tropical evening a nice way to experience some of the food here.What we did eat was very good as befits the standard of the main Michelin restaurant inside BUT the prices are not diluted and as another reviewer commented they are exorbitant.Food apart even a bottle of Tsing Tao beer is S$20, a very modest glass of Merlot S$22.I am glad I visited but it is not for the faint-hearted
4
Lei garden has been in around for last 40 years. Servicing Cantonese cuisine and it has one of the best time sum I have ever tried.Overly priced but If you are looking for a conducive environment with relatively good food this is the place to try.Everything here best eaten in its original flavor and you don't need any extra soya sauce or other condiments to go with it. Thumbs up to the Chef who did a great job !Best of all you don't get extra thirsty after eating which may means is MSG free
4
When one is paying $42 for 9 pieces of roasted pork, each twice the size of a man's thumb, it could well be said that the food is overpriced. Granted, though, that the above mentioned dish was Iberico pork over glutinous rice, and had almost unparalleled roasting done. It was delicious. The lobster broth with rice and condiments, which came in a luxurious looking claypot, was extremely delicious, could easily feed 2, and well worth the $28. The prawn with mushroom was expensive at $42, but also worth mentioning was the seasoning which made the dish tasty in general. Chinese tea, which the restaurant has several offerings of, were utterly ridiculously priced. For example, Pu'er was at $88 per pot, astounding indeed. The restaurant has won several awards, and is recommended for the taste of the food, though be prepared for the cost of an arm and leg for the dishes. There is an affordable lunch set menu of $38 per person, and I will probably revisit the restaurant, if only for the lunch
4
Seafood fried rice here is one of the best :) whether its packed or its dined in, it still taste great!
4
This is one of the best Dim Sum restaurants that I've ever been. When in SG I always have nice Chinese food and Lei Garden is one of the best.
5
I've now been here several times and never been disappointed. Great meal again and great service. The Peking duck and chilli prawns were to die for. Always worth a visit if you are in the area.
5
If you like Chinese food, there is Lei Garden. I have nothing negative to say, good and friendly waitors. Delicious food and served timely, lunch time was full house and a bit noisy but still enjoyable. I surely recommend thus restaurant!
4
Favorite night cap place over a 10 day trip. The staff is very friendly and the bucket of beers are ice cold which is perfect for the Singapore heat and humidity at night.
3
We had a tricky time ordering. For non Chinese or sing speaking the menu is very hard to readAnyway once we had the FULL menu we ordered some great stuffHigh quality high pricesQuite slow initially but warmed upVery popularDon't start st the top of the wine list look for the house poursGreat friendly staffWouldn't go bac
4
Rather hard to find in the Chijmes complex, but after accompanying a senior Singaporean businessman to lunch, (which ideally met our requirements for a light meal), we returned later in our trip for a further lunch from the Set Lunch ($13++) selection. Nicely prepared wholesome food in pleasant, quiet surroundings, and we will return next year
3
As compared to other restaurants, I believe this restaurant is a tad pricey. Food quality wise, I can find better at a lower price. Staff wasn't as professional as they were talking about their own schedule loudly across tables. Roast pork belly was not as good as I thought. However the charsiew is good. Dinner selection of dimsum is very limited so do some research before. I actually wanted to try the dimsum. Will come back if possible for the dimsum.

We went Lei Garden to yam cha for a taste of nostalgia as it was our family's go-to place for dim sum many years back (we switched to another restaurant in town due to convenience). Since they were recently awarded 1 michelin star, we were even more tempted to try if the standard was as good as before.We booked a table of 9 at 1130am on Monday, which happened to be a public holiday. Few tables were filled and we were brought to our seats promptly. Decor was elegant. At one corner, we saw a group of staff being gathered by their manager to go through what seemed like a morning ritual of service pledge, making things seemed promising.Our area was served by a captain, Coey Lam. We marked our order of dim sum and appetizers and gave them to 1 waitress. She asked if we wanted tea and soup to go along, so we ordered Tie Guan Yin but declined the soup as our main purpose was to yum cha. Subsequently, Ms Lam walked over, asking for our order again. We replied that we have given to her colleague. She continued with the question "Want soup?", which we again said it is ok. However, she repeated 3 times as if we did not hear each other and went on to say the various soups available.After some dim sum which were so-so, we were still hungry and decided to add on dishes from the main menu so we called for Ms Lam. Unlike her pushy self earlier, she gave a look of disdain as we ordered 3 more dishes which was uncalled for. After 15 minutes, none of the 3 dishes have arrived so we decided to check on the status and to have a look at the menu again. Perhaps Ms Lam was unhappy about working on a public holiday, her impatience was apparent and definitely not the kind of service we would expect from a 1 michelin star restaurant. While re-aranging the adjacent table, she was also oblivious to the noise she created from dragging the chairs; Ms Lam even "swinged" 1 chair and bumped into my sis' (luckily not her children who were seated on her 2 sides) without saying a simple sorry.Anyway the food was nothing more than mediocre and unjustified for the price, given such atrocious service. It is sad that a restaurant who had their glorious days have turned into this. If no improvement is being made, I guess they can attract only tourists who do not know the local food scene well and will not last long. Good luc

We celebrated our father's birthday at Lei Garden. There were 22 of us and we occupied 2 tables. The restaurant had the tables spread out so that it did not feel overly crowded. The 22 of us did not feel cramped as the tables were big enough, probably can take a max of 24 each. We were tucked at a nice corner for our birthday celebration. From the moment we entered the restaurant, the staff made us feel very welcomed and even kindly suggested where we should seat our elderly parents so that they were away from the air con, but at a vantage point so as to be able to see the entire family. The ambience and decor in the restaurant was impressive with huge mirrors on opposite walls reflecting the chandeliers into infinity. The staff were very enthusiastic and seemed very happy to serve us. They were cheerful and thoughtful enough to meet our different needs. Knowing that one of us likes to take photos of the dishes served, they would present the dish for the photo taking first before serving us our individual portions. The surprise of our dinner was the birthday buns that were served on a huge plate with a sculptured set of peaches on a "mountain" made out of old ginger set on top of one another. Next came the climax where 3 waitresses stood next to our tables and cheerfully sang the birthday song in 2 languages and a dialect, Cantonese. My father had a really good time! And, of course, not forgetting the sumptuous food which was carefully served with less salt and oil, but still every bit delicious. It was indeed one of our best birthday celebrations at a restaurant. Thank you, Lei Garden for the wonderful time we had. We look forward to our next visit there
5
The food is well prepared and tasty. Importantly the Chef does not use MSG, everything is prepared from scratch. The staff is competent and friendly. The wine list is extensive while a little overpriced
4
This restaurant is a good place to conduct a business dinner as the food is good and the atmosphere in the private room is perfect. Nice thing about this location is that the private room has an attached room for smoking so guests can just slip out for a cigarette break without disturbing the rest of the folks. The food was good although it did have the typical presence of a lot of oil in every dish. If you are looking for authentic Chinese, this place is a good spot
4
We were recommended to Lei Gardens by our butler at Raffles. Lovely location in the old convent grounds. We were early with no booking so managed a table inside. Initially the outside spruiker wanted us outside but we asked for inside which was no problem. Friendly and helpful staff. But we had a few issues with language but got through menu explanation ok. Unusual menu layout for us but with help from wait person we ordered Peking Duck served as pancakes with the skin followed by the meat in fried rice at end of meal. Traditional but was different for us. Pork rib with bun, crab dumpling and vegetables broccoli and asparagus. All dishes were very nice but just different to our expectations. A great experience and if criticism is required it was served a little too quickly and haphazard and wine price was crazy expensive. But that seems to be the way it is in Singapore. Better to stick with spirits and beer.All in all a pleasant meal, probably a bit too expensive but still happy we went
2
Group of 12 had dinner last monday. ..no roast pork no peking duck unless reserved ahead. Place was quiet even for Monday. Food was average quality even for alas kan crab. Service was slow and not like before. Price 2k. No abalone or sharks fins. Byo wines

Having been to Lei Gardens at its old location in Singapore on Orchard Road many years ago, I had put it on the "must-do" list for my current trip. So I went for dinner, along with a friend, to its new avatar located in the "Chijmes" complex of restaurants...and I'm sorry to say, I've just returned from one of the most bizarre eating experiences of my life.To start with, the restaurant is truly elegant...though rather brightly lit. They have a little alfresco terrace serving drinks and bar-snacks; and our initial interaction with the hostess was quite pleasant. We explained we were scheduled to meet people at another restaurant close-by; and if they hadn't come, we would much rather eat here. We were told we were welcome.However, when we DID go there 10 minutes later, we were told their last order was taken half an hour ago. When we expressed surprise, they agreed to serve us if we agreed to clear-out by a certain time...which we found strange, since no fine restaurant would throw diners out in the middle of their meal!Though that didn't happen, we were subjected to service that could only be described as casual in the extreme. The staff constantly carried-on LOUD conversations among themselves, seemingly oblivious of the fact that there were diners in the restaurant (we weren't the only table) and that such behaviour is NOT acceptable. The menu was very confusing; and we were given only the barest of guidance as to its intricacies.When the food arrived, we found some of it truly exquisite (the delicately-favoured steamed grouper and sharks' fin soup with crab meat) and some really mediocre (the noodles and the stir-fried chicken which was supposed to have Wasabi but there was none).Drinks were a dreadful Singapore Sling and a couple of glasses of their white house-wine which was just about passable plonk.In the middle of our meal, a lady arrived who was greeted with much fuss; and we guessed correctly she was the owner. We were then informed, in the midst of even louder shouting among the staff, that the restaurant had just won a Michelin star. We were thunderstruck. Was the food really THAT good? And what about the abysmal service-standards? Didn't Michelin rate restaurants on EVERY aspect of the dining experience?The final straw was when Madame graced our table with her presence, proudly crowing about the fact that this Singapore restaurant now joined their Hong King restaurants, all of which apparently have Michelin stars. I wanted to ask whether these could actually be bought...but bit my tongue. However, I did tell Madame I was returning to her restaurant with fond memories of how good it once was...and informed her the chicken with Wasabi actually had none. She agreed that was not how it should be, apologised (somewhat) and said she would inform the chef. But didn't offer to take it off our bill, which was staring her in her face. I guess graciousness stops at the bottom line. Which, in our case, was a whopping 360 Singapore dollars.Michelin gave this grossly over-priced, under-serviced eatery one star. So shall I

We are here during a busy lunch session. Staff aplenty and attentive. Chinese cuisine and as we were not really sure what to order, settled for a set meal. This was very good and tasty. We also had duck. This was shown to us then carved on a side table and I think just the breast meat served to the table. The gist of it is they will make something with the remaining meat as we were asked if we wanted rice. The remaining meat had been chopped and added to the rice! Quite pricy but then I think most of the restaurants which overlook the square are. We enjoyed the meal here and would recommend but might be an idea to peruse the menu in advance.

I think I'd taken it for granted that restaurants which have been recommended by hotel concierges were usually of high standard both in a culinary sense and in customer service. We had asked for recommendation of a nice Chinese Restaurant which served Dim Sum and obviously we knew it wouldn't be anything like a British Chinese. However, I have never been so shocked by the rudeness of the "welcome" reception lady at Lei Garden. She was so abrupt and rude. We were shown to a table right next to the door. Okay, we could've changed tables because the restaurant wasn't full but the lack of English understanding made it quite difficult. At first we were asked what we'd like to drink and we asked for the wine list. That took a bit of explaining but eventually it came. The wines are very, very expensive and we weren't prepared to pay a huge amount for what was turning out to be quite an extraordinary evening. We ordered 2 gin and tonics - this seemed to be very unusual and took quite a bit of explaining. When they arrived there was no ice nor lemon. We managed to get some ice.The menu itself is quite difficult to understand as the foods on offer are understandably things we have never tasted before. Sadly they didn't serve Dim Sum in the evening which we weren't aware of. The staff weren't at all helpful with explanations. So the food we ordered was tasty but we were made to feel very unwelcome and uncomfortable. I would never recommend this place nor go there again. Polite service is important whether it's a posh restaurant or a cafe - I don't care where I am but like to be treated as I treat others - with respect and humility

What a great lunch, welcomed with young ginger, to cleanse the palate. ( we even purchased some to take away)The cutlery and selection of chopsticks were very nice as was the ambiance and the attentive staff. We ordered bbq Pork buns and crispy deep fried eggplant which was like a delicate paste,Prawns wrapped in Beancurd, good quality chinese tea, Bok choy, and a very nice home made chilli and shrimp paste.Wine was quite expensive but on par with other prices in singapore. A very enjoyable relaxing lunch.
3
We had lunch on a Saturday and selected the set meal. The food was alright, nothing spectacular. The service was good. The place is quiet and nice, even though it is in the middle of bustling city. I would only go back again if there are good promotion
2
We wanted a Chinese meal and were recommended this restaurant. From arrival the staff were unwelcoming - the receptionist was surly - even though we had a reservation. Having been shown to a table we were ignored for 20 minutes - and we had to flag down a waitress eventually even to order a drink. The waitress was not helpful in explaining the menu. Food when it came was of a decent quality - although it arrived somewhat randomly, For much of the time we were there, we were the only non-locals - which is a recommendation for the food - but we did not feel very welcome - other tables had much more attentive service. Wine very expensive
3
One of the better Chinese restaurant in Singapore. However I find the price and quality going in opposite directions nowadays. If you are a regular, you will get much better service.
4
The restaurant is very pleasant. You benefit from a very spacious room, with tables far from each other, so the noise level is very low . We had a wide selection of dim sum for lunch. Great and friendly service from our waitresses. Highly recommend the delicious BBQ pork buns ( different kinds) and shrimp dim sums .

We went back to Lei Garden while visiting Singapore. Sadly the Orchard branch is closed and we went to Chijmes instead. The menu has changed a little and the ambiance is definitely more elegant than the casual upstairs Orchard but then food quality and the XO sauce is exactly as I remembered it and consistent across Beijing and Hong Kong.The house soup is expensive at 98 but good to the last drop, the mini pork, ok but pales to the fantasstic rib eye and we had kailan and fried rice too. The service is a little hapzard with all dishes arriving one after another which is ok in a chinese restaurant but not if we are all served in small individualised plates which makes it quite a mess at the table and a feeling we are being rushed. Recommend having a word with the captain to slow things down as we notice other tables were not having the same issue.Corkage is 10 per bottle which is reasonable given the nice glasses and actual service but being used to free corkage at chinese restaurants, this feels odd. Bill came to 312 for 4 small eaters but big drinkers which was fine.As we were winding down, a nice smell came wafting from the next table, it was a special chicken in claypot dish, something we look forward to trying next time
5
I was there to celebrate my friend' birthday during lunch time. I got good attention and service from the team even though the restaurant was quite full. The main reason for us to choose Lei Garden was for its Peking Duck. My friend has very high expectation and very picky about food, and I was glad that I chose Lei Garden.I can't deny that the price was a bit above average but it was worth when everyone were satisfied with the food quality and services. At the end, the restaurant manager gave us complimentary dessert for the birthday celebration which was very thoughtful.
3
I'm not really sure what we expected from Chijmes Lei Garden. Reviews were ok but when we visited we just didn't get the wow factor. The location is lovely and the actual restaurant is very grand but too bright, in my opinion, lighting could had been more subdued. We didn't get the welcome from the staff inside that we expected and didn't understand the need for all the staff to be wearing headphones, it made it all very impersonal.Food was only average and no particular help was offered to help us make wise choices. I wouldn't rush back or mention it to colleagues as a place to go. Oh and it's very expensive too! Not good value for money- again my opinion
3
i was as it was in my consideration to do my rom there, so i decided to have a lunch there on a weekday.the atmosphere was average, service was nice n pleasant. the dishes were slightly above average but not impressive. unfortunately i feel that their signature roast pork that my mum does is better than theirs. Their char siew was better. porridge was avg, soup was good and rather impressive even if its a soup of the day. chicken feet was exceptionally large but nice.we requested to view the private dining rooms as we were considering to do our rom there. there were several rooms available but it has a really 'old' feel to it. The atmosphere and design were not bad but might b a tad too quiet for my liking
3
Location is good Setting is nice with tanks for live seafood Service staffs are attentive and efficient We were regular at this joint many years ago Now that we return for a quick dinner, regret to say it does not taste as good as before Disappointing experience .
5
Staff were very proactive, enthusiastic and friendly in all ways. They gave lots of recommendation, and we were glad that we tried out some of them! The steam chicken and scallop with asparagus were extremely tasty and fresh! I couldn't get enough of it!The crab meat fried rice and noodles were just as tasty as well. I will definitely come back here for more
4
My husband and I ate dinner here on our penultimate night in Singapore. For the most part the food was delicious and we particularly enjoyed the sweet and sour pork with a bun and the pickled cucumber. The beef shin dish was not to our liking at all, it had an awful texture. We ate at around 9pm which is considered quite late and they had run out of a number of dishes that we wanted to try so may be worth visiting earlier in the evening. The service was friendly and efficient although there was something of a language barrier at times. The lighting in the restaurant is incredibly bright so there's not much of a romantic atmosphere but overall it's very nice. We enjoyed our meal here but don't think we'd be back again. NB. No dim sum in the evening
4
An excellent way to try Chinese food. Busy buzzy but stick with it and do wait for a table.The menu is simple and easy to navigate. Food comes quickly and fresh. Dim sum is excellent. Service is polite and friendly. Don't be scared to ask if you want something specific. Great value for money.
4
very very nice place. Food was good ... slightly on the expensive side .
Loved the salted egg yolk shrimps ,, and the Singapore sling. excellent & very attentive service
4
The dim sum fare was quite good. My favorite char siew pao (barbecue pork buns) were great as was the fish congee. Highly recommended.
4
My company had a tradition of celebrating CNY when we reopened for business.Lei Gardens manager and staffs gave us a warm welcome because we frequent Lei Gardens for corporate meal with overseas clients who stayed in nearby hotels, and also ordered big pots of "Buddha Cross the Wall' for Christmas buffet at our office, etc. We were given VIP room where we had meal , Lei Gardens manager and her captains wish us "Happy New Year" ,entertain us with jokes,and all of them were given angpow by our Chairman.We had special meals and desserts prepared by their chefs because we are their VIP customers. The foods are good
4
Orchard Lei Garden was the first Chinese restaurant we went to when we first came to Singapore many years ago. When it first opened, we used to go to the Chijmes outlet a lot for entertaining overseas guests, as it was one of the few premier Cantonese restaurants not located in a shopping mall. Returned recently. Service is still excellent, attentive and efficient, with helpful and friendly 'captains' - among the best in Singapore! The food is good, albeit not very creative and only above average in terms of quality. The setting now looks a bit aged. This explains why we haven't been back here for a while, and may not return anytime soon, unless we want to stroll around Chijmes for digestion after the meal; for nobody can take away the superb location of this oasis in the middle of the city that is a former convent
3
Visited the restaurant with some friend last week. The place is fully lit and very little ambiance. Felt like walking into a cafeteria. We ordered wine and the girl serving clearly had no idea how to pour wine. It was poured like water. Selected a few items from the menu: - shrimp - shark fin - wagyu beef (if I recall)- coconut dessert The shrimp was awful, it was fried and had a batter that you could taste. A pasty feeling in your mouth. The beef was ok nothing more, however for the price you pay you get only 4 tiny cubes. The shark fin and dessert were decent. Overall a disappointing experience and at a very expensive restaurant. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Cheers
4
For us it`s like an institution. We came here many years ago for the first time and kept a very well remembering. So we tried it this time again and it was the same perfect. They had done renovations meanwhile and so it is a bit more modern now, in a good way. Still they have the Aquariums at the wall, looking like screens. The rest is now in a kind of lounge optic. We had peking duck and different in 2 courses. Sweet and sour soup, vegetables and fried rice. I would like it a little more relaxed, but it`s the asian way to be fast, I guess

My mom treated extended family members to this restaurant for dinner on Boxing Day. There were altogether 16 of us, and that was the largest table that the restaurant could accommodate. The waitress recommended us to either have the water chestnut drink which I had which tasted nice and a bit refreshing; or the luo han guo drink which some other guests had. I tried my husband's one, and it just tasted bitter, kind of like the Chinese cough syrup. We had the appetizer- the jellyfish head specially aired from Hong Kong, the cucumber, and the fried white salanx chinensis (bai fan yu in Mandarin). We had the suckling pig as the first dish, it was a bit much, but luckily not too oily. The meat was okay, though a bit fattening, so I did not have a lot of it. Then there was the bird's nest, which was just nicely done; the fresh lobster with egg whites. The lobster was okay. I am probably not used to eating it, since I am allergic to seafood, and so could not comment much on it, Then there was the cod fish or the beef cutlets for the youngsters (6 of them). I had the codfish, which was tender and nicely done. It came with some kind of salad in mustard sauce, a fried item and a vegetable. Then we had the fried baby cabbage. It was really delicious. We also had their special dish- the soup noodles. It was unique as there were dried scallops in it. We had what their manageress recommended my mom to have as dessert- the coconut pudding. It was a bit sweet, but the coconut was not too strong, so it just suited my palates. We also had their zao hong gao (a dessert mini cake made with dates but came in layers). It was sweet but the portion was just right too. I felt a bit thirsty after the dinner, so think that the cook might have put too much salt or ajinomoto into the dishes. What surprised us is that when we exited the car park in the end, it was free parking
3
Had lunch there w a group of friends. We ordered dim sum as well as fried noodles with beef. Ambience is very nice in Chijmes Service was quite good but after lunch I felt very thirsty the whole day and suspected that they put quite a bit of salt and ajinomoto. Plus point is they give free parking
4
Had lunch with a colleague and a couple of clients. Hadn't been to Lei Garden for a while. Place was pretty crowded. Service was top notch. Attentive without being irritating. Food wasn't too bad. The roast meats were passable but not great. The Xiao Long Bao was good as was the fried rice. Pleasant place for a client lunch.
4
The staff at Lei Garden are very attentive and they take their work seriously. My favorite dishes are the braised pork in sweet sauce served with fried buns (the meat is super succulent, the bun is fragrant and goes well with the sauce) and crispy roasted duck (crispy skin, tender meat and topped with savory sauce). The mango pomelo dessert is very refreshing and not too sweet. Price is on the high side. Be prepared to pay $100/pax.
5
My partner here brought me dinner here. Picking duck very nice including other meals.
Staff really friendly, well service and take care.
4
Had a dim sum lunch here. Quality of food was excellent. Service was very transactional and not very friendly. Overall very expensive lunch but was good quality. I'd recommend but be prepared to pay highly for the food and drinks.
3
Food was excellent. Loved the dimsum and seafood choice. The staff were very helpful and attentive. Ambiance is very conducive to talking with friends. Price is very expensive.
5
Excellent food, attentive staff. A quiet night when we were there, and the service was impressive, and the food impressive.
5
We went twice to this restaurant for dim sum. It is inside Chjimes and it is beautiful. All dumplings are very nice and tasty. The fried dim sums are very crispy and not greasy. Food is of high standard. Service is good.
4
Always love the soup of the day prepared by Lei Garden. No where can I find another restaurant that serve it in a Clay pot and you can have more than one serving.because the soup excellent.So is the roast pork, we (my family) always come back for more after trying other restaurant
5
From now till early January it's the season for hairy crabs. It's also time to savor Xiao Long Bao with hairy crab roe. I really like the Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai Pork Dumpling) at Lei Garden Chijmes. Juicy, fragrant, fresh & tasty. Really authentic. Be careful when eating the dumpling though as the juice is pipping hot. It's best to bite a small hole & gently suck the juice out before putting the whole dumpling into the mouth. Many times I saw people burning their mouths as they shaft the whole dumpling into their mouths.
2
Went for a business lunch because the setting is classy but was disappointed with the food. Quite a few real Cantonese Dim Sum not available so we are not sure what the theme is anymore. The beef shin is probably still the best in SG (nowhere near HK quality!). The crispy pork was chewy and hardly crispy. Even the basic char siu bao was pretty average, like hawker standard. We finished the meal with Di Huang Miao in clear soup but the recommended air-flown Spinach is chewy and stringy (we actually requested for 枸杞菜 Wolfberry leaves but they don't have it! What kind of Cantonese restaurant can't serve Wolfberry leaves?). Overall, we enjoyed the setting but the food is a big disappointment
2
4 years ago I had a brilliant meal at this restaurant. I raved about it, on returning I found the dish was no longer on the menu. So disappointed, we ordered 2 other meals, they were rubbish and not half as good as the hawkers food. So overpriced and the waitresses knowledge of english is terrible. a bad experience
4
Our second visit to Lei Garden once again led us to enjoy the peking duck. Beautifully prepared. However for a non chinese speaker in Singapore normally restaurants are able to provide waiters who can speak english. We struggled with three waiters before an english speaker was found. This was embarrassing not only for us but the waiters too who were trying their best. Front of house should have been more forward thinking and directed us to the right spot in the restaurant. However we would still return when in Singapore again
5
This week we went to this fine restaurant and were stunned with the ambiance, warmth and friendliness of staff and place and extremely balanced authentic Chinese cuisine
A must go with friends, family or colleagues
3
Quite a few options to eat, but you will pay the price. We walk around but found that a meal for two with drinks would be around 100 SGD.
5
If you are craving real Chinese food, as the Singaporeans like it, when you are in CHIJMES, this is the place. Fast service.
5
lovely restaurant this , ate here regularly , the food was fresh and took a little while to get to you but it's because it's freshly prepared , very reasonable price wise too infact everything was good price wise in Singapore in General
5
When the waiter said about the peking duck, we just agree. And I very good peking duck we every taste. Other dish is also excelent. Price is fair.
4
This is a very good Chinese restaurant that is largely visited by local clientele rather than tourists. The service was very welcoming and good. The decor is clean, simple and modern chinese restaurant style and well presented.The staff had some difficulties dealing with the allergy issues that we had, but ended up doing so extremely well. Otherwise the staff was extraordinary in their attention to detail, from filling water glasses to clearing plates, and was an important part of the experience.The local nature of the clients is reflected in the dishes that are offered. the dishes are extremely fine chinese food. We enjoyed the Peking duck, wagu beef in lettuce wrap and steamed rice in particular. we asked for plain vegetables and the asparagus and broccoli dish was fresh and not overcooked. The entry to the restaurant is slightly hard to find in the complex as not on a street front
4
The most permanent F&B tenant in the Chijmes conservation project, this outlet offers a good view of the lawn and has the best location amongst the others in the chain. They serve good dim sum. Other dishes including seafood are average but pricey. Private rooms are available with a minimum spend which is not difficult to hit if you order their set menu. Managed like a traditional Cantonese restaurant, the main dining hall can get a little disorderly when packed, with wait staff shouting and scurrying around to fill orders
3
Had dinner there on a Friday night. The restaurant was barely half filled but the food took a while to come. While ordering the service staff repeatedly suggested that we order the daily soup even though we had politely declined when asked the first time. The quality of the food was so-so for the prices. They seemed pretty stingy when we requested for cut chili and chili sauce to go along with our food. Not something you'd expect of a restaurant of this caliber. There are definitely other better options for Chinese food. Unless you have other reasons to be at Chijmes
4
Lovely old building.Clientele were mostly locals which is always a good sign.Staff were efficient and helpful although we were not sure what we were ordering.Food portions were just right and our choice good as viewing other tables there were some exotic dishes available.Dishes came out in the order they were prepared which did not detract from the overall taste.A good choice and also close to por hote
4
A private room for a large group for dinner, so we had large servings of the many dishes.From what we ordered, the stand out dish had to be the 'Tempura fried wasabi prawns', which were a decent size. As well as the 'Scallops and Asparagus' dish which had so many large scallops for what you wouldn't normally see in most Australian Chinese restaurants. Limited options for dessert between fruit, mango pudding, and some other asian desserts like red bean and ice cream. If you aren't so familiar with these dishes best option is the mango pudding no matter what.A nice and different experience of a fancy Chinese restaurant settled in the Chijmes grounds. It was quite expensive for a group dinner of 16 to what we normally may pay in Australia. But large servings otherwise that will fill you up. Overall a good first experience
5
We went to Lei Gardens (about 40 of us) for our son and new daughter-in-law's 'Tea Ceremony' and we're very happy with it. The food was exceptionally good Chinese cuisine and the staff v attentive.
5
Good restaurants and fair prices, lots of ethnic tastes. In the evening socializing, live music, food (not a complete list) served in late hours.
5
This restaurant was recommended to us as a great yum cha place and it didn't disappoint. We thought the atmosphere was great, quite old world, food was wonderful and the service was great
Probably the best yum cha we have had
5
This place ranks amongst the best dim sum/ cantonese cuisine restaurant in Singapore. Excellent food and service; but what makes them 5-stars is their price. Amongst the best but cheaper; value for money!
4
just had dinner with some overseas friends. it was late about 8pm and the restaurant was half empty. it's my first time at this branch. the good service started from the moment we reached the restaurant entrance. the staff opened the door, greeted us, walked us to the table. the staff's recommendation was really good. we enjoyed the food, the ambience and overall excellent service. there are also private rooms on the 2nd floor, so that is also a good consideration for parties. will definitely return

We had a birthday lunch celebration at Lei Garden at Chijmes. Situated centrally next to the MRT station, in town. The Restaurant serves Cantonese cuisine and the establishment prides itself in creating high-quality delicious Chinese food. The restaurant was bustling with activity with waitresses moving briskly all over the place. The decor smacks of old world charm. Service is prompt and efficient, polite but mostly spoken in Mandarin. Noise level was acceptable thanks in part to the high ceiling, curtains and carpeted floor. We were fortunate that there were no loud parties, as experienced by some reviewers.Besides the dim sum, we had in addition, ordered a few dishes. The dim sum dishes came in quick succession. All very tasty and quickly disappearing from their serving plates. Our soiled plates were exchanged for clean plates when this was appropriate. Notable was the crispy suckling pig which had such crunchy skin and minimal amount of fat under the skin. The Kai Lan fried in garlic was crunchy, juicy and not fibrous. The crispy noodle with sea-food was also well flavoured. The pork belly was delicious, not too salty and the skin was so crispy. The egg tarts were very good. In general the food quality, freshness and preparation is good indeed. Flavours are nice, delicate and well balanced. The dishes were not too oily. The food is not cheap, but depending upon what you order, it will not break the bank either! Otherwise itâ€™s value for money, considering the food quality.I would consider this as a choice destination for all dining occasions, especially for weekend dim sum with the family. Access is wheel chair friendly.Parking is complimentary with tickets available to those who parked their cars in the basement. Otherwise, parking is very expensive, even on weekends.Hours: Mon - Sun 11.30am to 3.30pmMon-Sun 6.30pm to 10.30pm.Address: 30 Victoria Street, #01-24 Chijmes, Singapore 187996.Tel: +65 6339 3822.Web Site: http://www.leigarden.hk/eng

I chose this restaurant for a family reunion dinner during the Chinese New Year period. I had heard good reviews from friends. It was also centrally located next to the City Hall MRT station. The restaurant was very beautiful and service was outstanding. The staff were very attentive and obliging. Plates and cutleries were changed at the right time and right pace.Food was just average. Perhaps it was because we ordered the set menu so the dishes were mass prepared. The ambience was a disappointment. We were seated next to a table of 12-15 Chinese diners. They were talking very loudly and drinking alcohol. They did not seem to be eating much but were walking around the table and toasting drinks with one another. The din and cacophony from the boisterous diners made it impossible for us to hear even ourselves. Conversation at our table was impossible as everything we said was drowned out by their loud voices and shouts. We rushed through dinner and left because it was such a horrid experience.I think the restaurant should have separate rooms for such big groups of diners, to make dining a more pleasant experience for other diners. I will never go back to the restaurant again. Service is excellent, but the average food and horrid ambience are definitely a put off
3
We had a pre-Chinese New Year reunion dinner. The food was fairly good but the service was horrendous. The waitresses interrupts the conversation of 2 persons sitting side by side by squeezing herself in between and serving the food. Its not that there is no other place to wedge herself. We can't help but feel that we are rushed through our dinner. Its as if there is someone else waiting for our table. Overall, the food is fairly good and did measure up with the rest of the Lei Garden chain. But the service must be improved. Fine dining it is not
5
This restaurant is simply one of the best we have been to anywhere, to compare we have an Asian Restaurant in Melbourne Australia called "The Flower Drum" which has one the Best Restaurant in Australia for a number of years and certainly in Melbourne itself for a number of years. This place is as good as if not better, The Chijmes Building where it is located is beautiful as well being a former convent and church, I would say it is similar to Raffles Building with Large Rooms, lovely area and surrounds etc. We were warmly greeted after making a booking for our evening here and we took our Mums here to experience this amazing service. We asked for a Chefs selection of meals to be made up for us with 6-8 courses and were provided with an amazing selection of their signature dishes which included the Peking Duck, Abalone and Lobster with an approximate costing at $420 Singapore for the 4 of us as I had set the suggested rate and $100 per head. We have some wonderful wines as well as they have a great selection as well. We were waited on and never felt that we were left alone and the wait staff were very attentive to our needs always ensuring we were being looked after at all times.This is a fabulous restaurant and exceptional if you are happy to pay for the experience

Lei Garden is one of our favorite Restaurant.Every time we visit Hong Kong or Singapore, we always enjoy our meals here. But tonight we have difficulties to make our orders, the communication were all in Mandarin, although we have asked the use of English. When ordering a Fish Maw soup, it ends up with something, not so much like a fish maw soup. I was asking for a Menu but I do not know why we were only given two menu books ??? Tonight our selection was not to our satisfaction. The vegetables we ordered was not right, or maybe the cooking style and quantity was also not right. And I do not know why this time we feel the bill is extra high although there are no special items. A Cover charge (?) was added in the bill. I suggest Captains in a restaurant with an international reputation, should speak sufficient English, to communicate well with the guest especially in ordering the food correctly. The waiters should also be informed that a certain table, require English speaking communication, so they can always ask the guest in English when changing or collecting the used plates etc. Hopefully Lei Garden will always as good as we expect. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to the proprietor, management and staff of Lei Garden
5
Great lunch here, ask for the special dim sum menu.
Good quality & good value.
Note - you have to be there & order before 2.30pm.
3
Nice ambience but that was about the only plus point.
Food and service was average.
Didn't like their Peking duck but I thought they porridge was pretty good.
5
I am a frequent visitor to Singapore. By far, Lei Garden Restaurant located at Chijmes is one of my favourite. The food they served meets the expectation and is one that you will like to patronise again. I have lost count in the number of times I have been to this restaurant and have always left the place feeling satisfied. I supposed what makes the difference is what you know best to order. Also, who helps to provide the recommendation is important. They have a variety of good dishes which can range from economical to a more pricy dish if one decide to go for a unique savouring. In most cases, I look for Carol Chin who is the Senior Captain. She will always provide you with their signature dish but also hear you out on how it should be done (especially if you are ordering a fish dish). I find her to be a very customer oriented person and one who is very careful in the customer she is dealing with in terms of conversation and tactfulness.Overall, a restaurant that is worth a visit in case one is looking at value for money worth and delicious Cantonese food. Also, not forgetting the condusive environment be it for business or leisure enjoyment

Le Prive Chijmes is a great location to meet up for brunch/lunch on a Sunday. They open at 11:30am and have a wide variety of menu choices, you can view on their website. Ambience is very nice, being outside, yet under an awning. Service-not so good. In this experience (as I know may be a one-off) the service was really horrible. I am not sure the waiter spoke english other than what was on the menu. One member of my party ordered the English breakfast (easy-you'd think) and asked for poached eggs. The waitress first brought boiled....then scrambled...then said they were out of eggs. What? For brunch timing on a Sunday? Ok. So they offered him any other menu item-we ordered fries and potato rosti (both good).For myself, I first ordered a Croque Monsieur (also normal for brunch). The waitress said they were "finished already." On a Sunday morning, at 11:30am, when you open? Ok.Suggestions---train your staff well!! Seriously...the waitress looked lost when she kept bringing the wrong type of eggs. A different staff member came over about 3 times to see what was going on. Then a male-possible the manager- could be seen behind the bar speaking vividly with the waitress, as if it is our fault (or her fault) they have no eggs.Usually these issues go back to management and training. Fix them! You have a great location and good menu/food quality! Don't let the service ruin you!I would go back however, to give them one more chance (and hopefully they have more eggs and ingredients for Croque Monsieur--on a Sunday morning....)Cost:We ordered 1 bottle of wine, 1 coffee, 2 juices, 6 main orders, 2 desserts3 couples = $95 per coupl

A restaurant is a combination of food quality, ambience and service. In this case the service was so lousy that I was not even able to appreciate the other elements. The experience was really negative. Their main worry was to speed up as much as possible and to put the customers out of the restaurant. They claim that the restaurant closes at 22.30 but before 22.00 they were only focused in getting everybody out of there. I was finishing the meal and I had in seconds a waitress with the bill in her hands claiming the payment. To avoid by all means

We visit Lei Garden in HK quite frequently and we were expecting the same when we visited Lei Garden @ Chijmes. Having been here many times before, we found both service and food quality deteriorating with some dishes too salty. There seems to be a lack of pride in serving gd food and providing a gd consistent service. For the price you are paying, you would have expected the high standards but we thought our evening out was a little underwhelming
4
Six of us enjoyed a relaxed business dinner. We were fortunate to have a Singaporean Chinese colleague order for us and therefore sampled a variety of dishes and flavours that we might not otherwise have found. Every dish was interesting. I liked the salted egg prawns more than the bean curd cubes and the steak more than the noodles, but it kept coming. Poor wine list. Awesome food

After a long tiring day, I and my wife never wanted to get back to the hotel and have some boring food. So Chijmes was suggested by the taxi driver, when we said drop us to a place where we can get good food and also walk back to our Hotel. As soon as I entered, I was in for a surprise, never knew about this place, it looked so vintage and at the same time I could see all the modern bar and restaurants offering multiple cuisine. Initially I was taken by the beauty of the place and till the time I did not take a complete look at the place, I did not settle. Being a vegetarian I chose to take a safe bet of Pizza and settled for Pizzeria Giardino. It was a nice cozy place with outdoor sitting (which I wanted), ordered beer, pizza and desserts the food was excellent, the staff was very courteous. I reached very near to the closing hours, but the waitress did not mind that and served us, till the time we said, thank you. I don't remember the name of that girl, but really appreciate her courtesy. Overall multiple choices of food under one roof, a range of restaurants and bars, to choose which style of dining is preferred. Food was great at Pizzeria Giardino, can't comment on others and byfar a good location for dinner. However on an expensive side, as I shelled out $80 for 2 people on vegetarian

I've been on a quest for the best dim sum in Sigapore. I found me 3 girlfriends who share the same passion for steamed dumplings and we've been on a mission since.Our ratings are based on:1) Overall quality of food (one shouldn't be trekking to a dim sum spot for any one particular dish)2) Ambiance3) ServiceLei Garden, of HK fame, has been on the radar so we finally booked last Saturday:Definitely amongst the better har gows and siu mais in town. Far from the best, but sitting comfortably above the mediocre line. Everything arrived promptly, which is always key for two reasons: dim sum ought to be served pipping hot, and more importantly to maximize variety at any given moment.The space was nice enough, a bit tired, but comfortable and pleasant with a nice weekend crowd. The kind of place one could invite fellow yummy mummies or future in-laws to.Service - everyone was friendly and adequate though they didn't give me much else to say about that.Verdict: I've added Lei Gardens to our Return list, which isn't bad considering there are only about 3-4 other places on the list

We ate here on our first night in Singapore, having been recommended to try Chijmes for a choice of restaurants near our hotel. Unfortunately Chijmes is undergoing some major renovations at the moment and there were very few restaurants open for business that night. We opted for Lei Garden and it was ok but much more "authentic" than we had experienced before. Feeling adventurous we ordered a selection of items, including a couple of things we had never seen on a menu before (neither of which were very nice). The staff spoke very little English hence were unable to help us choose more wisely. Even by Singapore standards it was an expensive meal with wine prices even we baulked at. Not somewhere we would return to
3
Went to Lei garden for a large company dinner. Very average food - possibly struggling with the CNY rush. Service while helpful is a problem as understanding of English is very challenged. Not worth another visit.
3
The room is very pretty, but we found the food very bland. The servers were distant and unhelpful as well.
4
Located in the Chijmes complex close to the Raffles Hotel so we ate here after our obligatory Singapore Slings. The setting is lovely, an old Catholic convent which now houses lots of restaurants and bars in the buildings and the cloisters. The lei garden is in one of the halls which has very high ceilings with beautiful plasterwork. We were the only Europeans in the restaurant that night which made it a fun experience. The staff had limited English but were smiling and helpful. There are lots of fish tanks with various fish and crabs and the revolting looking geoduck ( a house speciality) where a hand often appears to catch someone's dinner.We ordered too much, crispy duck, which was prepared at the table, belly pork and green beans, noodles and rice. We ordered wine, which was expensive but hey ho it was a top end restaurant and we would have paid more in the UK. SGD200 approx Â£100 so a very pleasant evening out
3
Been at Lei Garden a few years back and didn't like the food very much. (too bland).Had a company dinner with set menu this time and the food was better than before. But keep in mind that this is a Cantonese restaurant, don't expect the bursts of spice and flavors of other Chinese cuisines. Service was poor for such an expensive and half empty restaurant. It wasn't so much the lack of staff but the aloofness that disappointed us.Will not return, poor value for mone
4
Good food, ambience and good service. Chinese fine dining but not outrageously priced.I often take the set lunch for 4 pax for lunch meetings or else a mixture of dimsum, soup of the day and possibly a vegetable or noodle dish.They have weekend set dinners and those are usually great value for money
4
Decided to go there on New Years day and was given a table next to a dirty old screen despite making reservations! The food was excellent but the dirty screen lowered the enjoyment of the overall experience. The service staff was adequate at most although never rude or dismissive. If you decide to go there make sure you request for a table in the main dining hall. It may be a bit noisier but definitely more pleasant than being cooped up next to a dirty screen in a little dead-end corner of the restaurant
3
Having spent a day sightseeing, we ended up at Chijmes looking for a great dinner to end the day and enjoy a bit of Premier League as well.The courtyard was crowded, and the service poor. Having found a table, we waited over 20 minutes to get served. The waiter seemed disinterested in assisting us with the order.The food, once if came out was average and tasteless.The drinks were expensive even by Singapore standards, but the atmosphere watching the game was amazing!I probably will go again, not to eat but enjoy the experience of cheering a football game with the crowd
5
It is so so so delicious! The poached geoduck is amazing, thinly sliced and poached in clear chicken broth. The waitress serve us in a very professional manner, and did the poaching just right. Thank you so much indeed. Apart from that, they have a huge variety of live seafood, many kinds of ocean catched fish. Definitely the best chinese restaurant in Singapore. A must try in Singapore
5
Me and my family first tried eatingg here during our stay and it was deliciousThe roast pork is a must try! It was so soft and good. Definitely delicious!The ambiance is nice and comfortable, somewhat cleanWe tried beef rib eye and it was delicious as well as other courses that we hadI would definitely come back again

Dim sum is not available in any shape, size or offering in the Bordeaux area, so this was high on our list for our Singapore visit.We tried to get into the Wah Lok at the Carlton Hotel which is considered to be one off the best in Singapore, but it was booked out on the Saturday, so our Hotel booked us into the Lei Garden at Chijmes, which is now a food court with many different restaurants in an old Convent/Orphanage, one of the last remnants of the old Singapore.Don't let them put you upstairs, which is generally a quiet area received for Occidentals. We insisted that we be moved downstairs amongst the locals, which is buzzy and noisy.The dim sum was very good, and not expensive, and varied enough for all tastes.My only downer is that I still prefer dim sum trolleys of food passing by, rather than having to order from a menu, and the fact that the decor is fairly bland. Service was very good. You do need to walk a fair way to get to a cab stand.We had Chinese tea with our dim sum lunch, but I checked out the wine list and prices were scary
4
Peking duck skin with leeks in thin crepe-like wrap is superb! We enjoyed all we ordered. Steamed bamboo shells with enoki mushrooms, fish hotpot, silken tofu, roasted chicken, duck with ginger hotpot. They also have live seafoods.
5
Absolutely beautiful place to eat with many restuarants - something to suit everyone! I love the fajitas from the La Viva Spanish bar & tapas!
4
there are many restaurants located in one location. One evening we had steaks and another pasta or pizza. Just a few blocks from the convention center on victory street. mostly outdoor seating but the have portable fans or airconditioners. Very good place to sit, eat and talk

We went to Lei Gardens as it had good reviews on trip advisor. The staff we unfriendy not a smile from anyof them, the food was nice but very expensive we ordered the whole peking duck and other dishes, we were served the skin in the pancakes and waited for the rest of the duck when we asked where it was we were told that was it after paying $66 for the duck and only geting 16 very very small pancakes for 4 of us and also being charged a service charge for the tooth pick and KFC type refesher towel we felt very ripped off would not recomend this restaurant to anyone
1
Arrived to very grumpy waitstaff. Rushed through any ordering we tried to place. Very unhappy to answer any questions we had. Ordered the peking duck "whole duck" $66. Got the pancakes with the duck skin , yum. Waited for the rest of the duck only to be told we had eaten all the duck. Well , as the duck was carved at the table we were fully aware that we hadnt eaten all the duck. Very grumpy , rude arrogant staff , ok food and high prices. AVOID!!!!!!
5
We stumbled upon Lei Garden after being advised to go to the Chijmes group of restaurants. there are a number of restaurants to choose from in this innovative upgraded colonial building courtyard space. Lei Garden was just beautiful. We had duck which was simply wonderful as well as the wasabi chicken some rice and a plate of vegetables to share. The staff were so friendly and helpful without being annoying. A most memorable meal in Singapore
5
A group of six of us were trying to find an excellent Peking Duck experience in Singapore and were pleasantly surprised! We were directed to Lei Garden by the concierge at the interContinental even though using Trip Advisor we were thinking of another place. The restaurant was very clean and pleasant with white tablecloths and immaculate service. The Duck (which we had to order ahead of time) was presented to the table and then the Peking Duck was prepared table side. They then asked us how we would like the meat from the duck prepared. We elected to have it done in lettuce cups. Hard to say which was better, the pancakes were small and thin and the hoisin sauce was perfect, the skin was crispy and flavorful- basically perfect!. The lettuce for each cup had been cut with shears so that each cup was the same size and the duck mixture with water chestnuts and other ingredients was likewise beyond yummy! We also ordered many other dishes all of which were well presented and tasty. One mistake we did make was that were many items on the menu that we would have like to have ordered that also required ordering in advance.Another note is that there was very little english spoken- they were able to drum up a waitress who spoke enough to get by and she along with the rest of staff were flawless. We were also very pleasantly surprised by the bill- we all guessed it would be twice what it turned out to be
5
The food, the presentation of the food, the service was all excellent. We did a set meal with 7 courses it was great. The 1st course had taste variety, 2nd course chicken soup was savory with good meat, 3rd course barbecued Abalone was tasty, 4th course Sea Grouper was excellent, 5th course Duck was good, 6th course braised noodles with prawns was EXCELLENT, 7th course coffee was good. We had also ordered a special tea which was served throughout the meal which was good
3
The service staff were excellent. Not only were they attentive and full of smiles, they were very enthusiastic in making food recommendations. I remember that the Lei Garden was famous for its Cantonese cuisine but what we ate that night seemed more like Northern Chinese cuisine. Food was not outstanding and definitely not unique. What a pity
2
Chijmes located in the heart of the central business district of Singapore was converted from a 100 year old girls convent school with a collection of restaurants ...prices more for the tourist that have "deep pockets." I happened to experience Lei Garden, a famous Chinese chain found in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Singapore and Shanghai known of its Cantonese cuisine. Food quality so so but ambiance definitely impressive as it occupies the main section that overlooks the Gothic-architecture and sprawling gardens. Amazing to see how they created a sunken garden with open air "been garden" style pub from a "tennis court.
5
This restaurant has a calm elegant ambience and serves the most wonderful food.It is always a treat to go there -staff are very efficient but could perhaps smile a little more
3
This is the sixth time we had dinner on 14 March 201 at Lei Garden at Chijmes ,and foods had been always good, but time around we were disappointed on number of factors. The quarter duck they have served were full of bones though it was chopped into 10 bite pieces. The rest of the food this time were just average like the kurubuta pork that came with "low quality asparagus" at a side which I also thought was lack of presentation. The wasabi-lemon mayo prawn was of inconsistent in sizes and nothing to shout about.We opt to bring our own wine with a corkage charge of $20.00 which we expected to pay as the Chinese Tea is not just worth paying for $88.00 ++ for 4 persons.We always had more than 1 servings for soup but not this time and the soup alone price tag was US$90.00 for 4 servings.Staff were in a hurry to clear our plates though the rest of us were still tucking in and not packed.Any comment from the owners? Please explain  SDR, Singapor
3
I went to the Chijmes location on a business trip, solo, and Cantonese is hard to do with only one person... But the wait staff was not overly helpful with my order and I felt just rushed me through selections with their bossy "You want this?" and "You want this?" without explaining what any of it was. In the end, i had a S$160 bill. For ONE. Some of the fried items were dripping with grease - like the softshell crab. Maybe I didn't order correctly, but again, they were the ones that suggested these things. Probably would not go back - at least not without a Singaporean - or Cantonese - to help me order
3
This is a chain and prices for a la carte does not come cheap as it caters for those with fat wallets n overseas visitors whom are impressed with the ambience n setting in a historic n beautiful heritage building. If you look at the fishtank n see big lobsters n geoduck s that's a telling sign food will be expensive. We came here for a new year set lunch n it was ok not memorable except for big chunks of a shark fin which I rather avoid.My tip is its good for entertaining guests but be prepared to pay .., looking at rental of premises they have to charge high for A premium spot
4
It intrigues me that most Singapore restaurants charge a "service charge" but gives no service. I am delighted Lei Garden at Chijmes is different as the staff are friendly and rather pleasant. Dim sum is good and I particularly like their crispy skin chicken but the roast pork is rather fatty! It was our first time there (my husband and I) and found the whole lunch experience satisfying and delightful. I was very impressed that the restaurance actually cancelled and not charge for a dish I found too salty - really appreciate that! A restaurant that really listens to their customers is hard to find! Will definitely go back to try other dishes

I went to this restaurant with my girlfriend because it was highly recommended on TripAdvisor. Our visit put the quality of the reviews in doubt.The service in the restaurant was not good at all. The waitresses were never asking anything, wondering around before taking plates from the table. One waitress poured my drink on the table in the beginning. There was only one waitress who could speak a little bit of English. However she didn't understand my order fully, which cost me money in the end.The food was nothing but average. Absolutely not worth the money they are charging for. The whole dining experience was very confusing. We got main course before the soup. Rice came just before we were finished with our beef. After that we got our vegetable.When we got the check there was numerous errors on it. They had written in Chinese language some sauces there which we didn't order at the first place. My girlfriend ordered tea, the price for that was $39+++, which was more than our main course. The starters were charged twice, even though I clearly asked only one order. They didn't agree to negotiate about that.For the sugar on the top there was something in the end of the bill for $5. I was asking about it and they told me it was the refreshing napkin which was on the table when we arrived. Thank God we did not use any toothpicks or other things they had!This place was a total rip off and absolutely one of the worst dining experiences in our lives. If you go there, make sure you write down and double check price for everything and go through the bill before paying
4
We had dinner at this restaurant on our first night in Singapore and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and cooking of the dishes we tried. The restaurant is very large and not very romantic with bright lights. However, the food is very good with many interesting dishes to choose from
4
Stepping into the Lei Garden is definitely a wow factor because this restaurant is beautifully decorated with European flair. It feels like one of those antique British clubs, and is a good place to bring guests you want to impress. The food, though, to me was high quality but for the price I think Crystal Jade, or even the Orchard Lei Garden is better. Service was good but one thing I didn't like was that staff kept trying to push dishes at us. We had to tell them times that we didn't want to order the hairy crabs
3
This is my uncle's favorite place. I think it's good but it does not have the punch to make it great. However, it's always so packed when I come to this restaurant. Is there possibly a super delicious dish that I haven't try here? What I like about this place is the atmosphere or more like I'm bias to Chijmes. I like Colonial architecture and it's great that they preserve it well. Even better, they turn it into a restaurant hub and bars so that we can enjoy the beautiful architecture. As the place is nice, I think it would be a good place for you to bring your business partners/ clients for dinner
4
Very good Chinese Food in a central location. Good service, very clean and consistent restaurant. Lei Garden never dissappoints. Good place to bring out of town visitors. Can be a bit expensive, but worth the quality if the food. Bring a jacket, aircon is set to arctic levels.
4
Big open plan restaurant, good staff and quality tableware on a spotless table cloth. Very extensive menu filled with excellent food choices. The quality of the food is very good, the tea flows unencumbered...
4
Delicious and exquisite dim sum - quite a pushy waitress recommended a couple of dishes but we didn't mind - she did it so charmingly! High end but good family atmosphere.... will definitely make this a regular haunt once we have moved to Singapore!
4
We went to dinner here with a local. The foods they offered were excellent (and this is bearing in mind that we had stuffed ourselves full for a few days). The staff was attentive and very sensitive to the needs of the guests. I highly recommend the suckling pig. All in all, it was a very pleasant dining experience. Although, a bit of a warning, it is very pricey
4
My company booked the restaurant (ground floor) for a dinner for about 100 people.Service wise, the restaurant struggled coping with such a crowd - surprisingly. Drinks were slow, place was perhaps a little too cramped, and maybe a little short handed. Nevertheless, the food was good - certainly surpassed my expectation for big group dinner. The Geoduck sashimi, Shark's Fin with Hairy crab was exquisite. The crispy rice in broth was different and quite nice. All in, great Chinese food, but you'll have to certainly pay for it
5
I went here for lunch with a local and certainly was not disappointed. The service was excellent, attentive but not obtrusive and the food was divine. I can heartily recommend the pork belly, crispy and not fatty at all. The small steam dumplings were delicious. Clearly everything is freshly prepared and all members are staff were great. Highly recommended
4
The restaurant is very convieniently located and offers a wide variety of Chinese food. The service as well as the wine list is outstanding. However, they sometimes tend to recommend dishes that can be amazingly expensive for what you get, e.g. one pork rib for around SGD 50
5
This is a great retreat for excellent Chinese food. It is just across the street from Raffels and very tranquil. The diem sum is ordered by checking what you want in a little menu card. I always go for the small steamed dumplings; the shrimp in rice rolls,and what ever seems unusual and to the season. At night I order the Peking Duck which is different in Singapore as light pancake crepes are offered with the crunchy skin in lieu of the usual white steamed buns or tortilla like rice cakes. The service i good ; all wines in Singapore are just too expensive so I porer melon juice
5
Found this place by chance - had gone (again) to Grand China but they wouldn't seat me since it was 1:35pm and they closed at 2:30pm - and just started walking and looking. Now Lei Garden will have a repeat customer. I have dim sum often in NYC and SFO so I appreciated their more varied selection from the usual Anglo favorites
5
Over the last fifteen years we have eaten lunch at many Lei Garden branches in both Singapore and Hong Kong. This is only the second time we ate at Chijmes. We were shown to a table in a row of tables for two in the middle of the large room. We ordered our favorite: roasted chicken with sesame, Hong Kong kailan, and glutinous dumpling with sesame. Crystal Jade and other restaurants also make glutinous dumplings with sesame, but we feel Lei Garden makes the tastiest version. The food came promptly, and it was well prepared. The layer of spices on the roast chicken seemed thinner and lighter in color than at the Lei Garden branches in Hong Kong which seem to do a slightly better job of preparing it. We were glad that roasted chicken was on the Chijmes menu because the Orchard Road branch have requested that we order it a day ahead of time. The layout of the Chijmes Lei Garden, with large garden windows and a fish tank at one wall seemed friendlier and more relaxed than at the Orchard Road restaurant. We enjoy the reliability of the food and the service, which is somewhat old-fashioned (they put your order on your table, and people come by to check it) but efficient. It is especially delightful to walk about in the quiet shade of Chijmes after leaving the busy activity of Lei Garden
5
Chijmes Lei Garden is situated in the Chijmes courtyard area across the road from Raffles City shopping mall (and diagonally opposite a corner of Raffles Hotel ). Went there for Sunday lunch with the family and had mainly dim sum chosen by marking up a paper menu. Also had a couple of other dishes suggested by one of the waitress. Overall quality better than many places we have been to in Hong Kong. Smart dining room includes a spectacular fish tank which occupies almost a whole wall at one end of the dining room. Pleasant service
5
Absolutely charming decor and surrounds. Stunning table flowers and linen etc. Felt very colonial and posh! Prices were OK and food very yummy. We had the Peking duck and it was yummy. The staff were friendly and played with our toddler to keep her entertained.
5
Staff were excellent, but surprisingly not that used to English-speaking customers.
5
Most favourite restaurant in Singapore, we ate here every saturday for 3 months best dim sum!! 
5
Even with the usual Chinese New Year rush, the service standards are excellent. The food, as usual, well presented and delicious. Highly recommended for that special evening to entertain your clients or simply relax with your loved ones.
5
great music bars especially insomnia , this is the best live rock music house in singapore with current resident band "ALL ACCESS "
5
We had a great dinner at Lei Garden. Great service and very solid & sophisticated Cantonese food. Great for business entertainment as the service staff ate very attentive. However, it's not cheap so there is no element of value unfortunately. If you can expense it (not paying out from your pocket) and want a great Chinese food then this is it.
5
We have eaten at Chijmes Lei Garden Restaurant many times and have yet to have had anything less than a great meal. For me, the food served here is as good as it gets. I would highly recommend the steamed bamboo clams in garlic sauce and also the wintermelon soup, which needs to be ordered a day in advance. Those two are our favourite dishess, but everything else we've ordered has been excellent. The service is about as efficient as can be found anywhere. We'll eat there again next time we're in Singapore
3
We came here on the recommendation of Trip Advisor. Bad idea. The restaurant was very nice atmosphere, but horribly expensive 184 Singapore dollars without wine. And this was for lunch! The food was average Cantonese ... Certainly not exceptional. The service was over vigilant. They hovered over the table and wisked plates away before you finished. Not a happy experience
3
The restaurant is up-market, the food ambitious and high quality, the service acceptable, and the price is high. You certainly pay for the cleanliness, ambience and decor of this place.Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the meal. There were some startlingly good things on the menu, especially for those willing to be adventurous. The wine was pretty good too. I'm just happy that someone alse picked up the tab. Special occasion stuff
4
Be careful there are 2 Lei Garden restaurants when you read reviews, this one at victoria street is in the chijmes complex a former convent. It consists of mainly private dining rooms and since we were a group of 24 people we were served a previously chosen 10 course menue which was all in all very well prepared. One may not like everything, like stuffed sea cucumbers, but it was well done. The wine prices are outrageous but there is also a house wine, red and white, for about 130 S$ - by far the cheapest. And the staff has no idea how to present them, even expensive French red wines - you get a sip and then one more. our host commented ' I have tried it already' but no change, they came around with a mouthful every time but in general very polite. The pork belly was not crisp at all but the twice cooked seafood soup, the whelks, giant shrimp and especially turbot 2 ways was excellent. The salad with 2 halfed scallops was okay but a little iffy - mayo dressing? The stuff was certainly not very well trained but polite. The same about the food - it looked nothing like the dishes on the homepage but it was good to very good. Nothing to compare with high end restaurants in China but because they offer quite a variety I would say very good
2
Food was iffy and the prioces outrageous. Stay home...
4
great food and service but there wines are verty expensive still think that the one in Hong Kong is much better but try the shark Fin soup very special taste, stick to the tea and soft drink, to avoid a very expensive bill
3
Friendy staff and reasonable service although not osaka standard.
Tasty and well presented food although limited quantity. not special.
Elegant but costly by Singaporean standards

I have lost count of the number of visits I have paid to Lei Garden in Chijmes, and I am at a complete loss to understand the poor ratings given by some reviewers her. Especially when the same restaurant in Orchard Road is ranked 40th in Singapore. I suspect that some of the reviewers of the other branch just didn't notice the address differences on the TripAdvisor info pages.Anyway, I can assure readers that the Chijmes branch is every bit as good as the Orchard Road one, so do go here without the slightest hesitation. I have lived 12 years in Hong Kong, 5 in Malaysia, and almost 20 in Singapore, and have eaten at the best (and the worst!) Chinese restaurants in all of these places, as well as in London, New York and so on. I would not place Lei Garden in my top ten, probably not even top twenty, but it does offer excellent food at what seems to me very reasonable prices. The dim sum in particular is worth highlighting as it is always freshly prepared, well presented, interesting, and very high quality. The char siu pau would be hard to beat anywhere, as would the cheong fun, the law bahk go (Turnip Cake), and the dumplings with ginger and vinegar. But non-dim sum dishes are always a pleasure, too.This is not an expensive restaurant at all when you take into account the food, ambience, location, quality and quantity of staff. We have often walked away full with a bill of no more than $30-40 a headTry, also, the Peking duck -- ask them to serve the flesh of the duck minced with lettuce leaves. Also be sure to order a plate or two of the Lei Garden XO sauce, an art form in its own right.On our last visit in August, we did feel the service was not up to its usual high standard....hopefully this was a temporary aberration

We celebrated my husband’s 50th birthday 4 years ago at Lei Garden Restaurant, CHIJMES. We enjoyed the food very much and felt the food that we ordered was of high quality and standard. We had a private room and appreciated the privacy and the good service that was provided by the staff.Due to the great experience we had previously, we decided to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary and Mother’s Day dinner this year at the same restaurant. We were utterly disappointed with the food and angry with the whole experience. We will never return to this restaurant again and recommend our family and friends not to do so either.I contacted the restaurant about 3 weeks before (14/4) the date that I wanted to make the booking for to book the restaurant and discuss the menu. I spoke to a staff member there (I do remember her name but will not disclose) to make a booking for 6/5 and requested for a menu. She advised that she would email the menu to me. After one week of not receiving any correspondence by email for the menu, I rang again (20/4) to request for it and again I was told it would be emailed to me. I made a final call (30/4) before I left Australia on 1/5 to confirm the booking and to request for the menu again. The menu never arrived. I wanted to have a look at the menu and pre order so that it will be easier for us and the restaurant when we arrived on the day. More time to spend with guests instead of worrying about the menu. I also booked a private room this time.When we arrived in Singapore on 5/5 I immediately rang Lei Garden to confirm the booking and request for the menu again. The menu was finally emailed to me. The menu was about a 10 course meal recommended by the restaurant. A full menu was not provided. I discussed the menu with a staff member and decided to change one of the dishes on the menu. The steamed fish was changed to a fried sweet and sour fish as we had guests who did not like steamed fish.It was the worst sweet and sour fish we ever had in any Chinese restaurant. It was prepared/cooked like fish and chips, without the chips of course. The fish was deep fried in batter and served individually with a plain sweet and sour sauce to pour over the fish. The sweet and sour sauce was like something out of a bottle that you buy from the supermarket. It tasted horrible!! I would have expected much more from such a well known Chinese restaurant. I am sure even at a hawker stall, the sweet and sour fish dish would have been prepared/cooked in a much better way. The way this dish was prepared made me very angry and I lost my appetite!!The salted fragrance village chicken was another very disappointing dish. The chicken was cold and soggy. The younger guests didn’t even want to eat this dish. The barbequed suckling pig wasn’t that great either. The previous time when we were there, we took the meat of the pig home and enjoyed eating it very much the following day. This time when we took the meat home to eat the following day, we had to throw it out as the meat had a strong unpleasant smell. Very disappointing.The meal cost nearly SGD$1,400. We enjoy good food and are prepared to pay for good food and have travelled around the world to experience good and unusual types of food. But this was by far the most disappointing experience for a very expensive meal which wasn’t worth the price we paid. We are happy to pay a lot for good food, but it was totally unacceptable to be asked to pay so much for a disappointing meal.We will not fall into this trap again, ever!! Singapore has many other much better Chinese restaurants to offer which serve great food for a fraction of the price that Lei Garden charges

Looks like a smart chinese restaurant in the centre of Singapore. Placed our order for crispy pork for £15. Three small flaccid pieces of processed pork arrived about fifteen minutes later. Not even a decent sized starter, though billed as a main course, and it looked like something out of the cheap shelf at Lidl.The vegetarian option we also ordered didnt arrive at all.Had two dim sum. Flaccid slimy outer casing, with slimy tasteless schlock inside. Actively revolting.I wouldnt go back here if you paid me

Great food. Some may say that it's pricey, but I really think that value is very subjective. I regard this place more of food enjoyment like a piece of art. The value is determined by the person appreciating it.Location wise is pretty central, easy accessible by mrt. The taste is good, high standard. The cuisine is exquisite and fine. A great enjoyment both for the taste buds and eyes..

The restaurant's ambience was great and they have one of the nicest and cleanest bathrooms in any Chinese restaurants. This basically sets the tone of what you will be paying for the meal. The quality wasn't great, thus I do not see the value for money if you choose to dine here.I decided I will most likely not come back to this restaurant within the first 30 minutes after I sat down. Why? Please read on.....Our reservation was for a family of 14 for dim sum lunch and they could only accommodate us on 2 smaller tables at the corner, fortunately, by the window, overlooking the courtyard. I arrived on time (family was late, so i sat there waiting, while browsing through the menus and special offers).Within 20 minutes, no less than 4 waiting staff came to me, one after another, highlighting their "special promotions and items of the day/week/occasion" etc etc etc.I must give it to their management for training the upselling skills of the waiting staff, it takes one with an steel mind not to be sold... mind you, they were persuasive and pushy! The "special promotions and offers" were mostly expensive seafood and pricey items.Within 10 seconds after I sat down, the hostess will tell you how great their herbal tea is, great "cooling" effect ideal for the weather in Singapore! Next up, another staff highlighted their blue lobster special promotion (limited period only). Then, it is the Chinese New Year pre-order promotion (New Year Cake, Pen-cai, whole suckling pig etc etc. Finally, come try our special winter melon soup with special ingredients (S$88 per pot), "ONLY 2 POTS left, you have 2 tables, one for each table, OK?"I totally understand the staff has to upsell the promotions to increase average spending, but what I experienced was an orchestrated pushy selling tactic, wave after wave, stopped only after the ordering was made. I was only looking forward to have a nice dim sum lunch on a Sunday afternoon. Thanks to the pushiness and hardselling of the waiting staff, it totally took away what I was looking for. I had much better experience at Peach Garden and Hua Ting at Orchard Hotel

The Lei Garden website has this boast: “Every Lei Garden staff is well conversant with the four pitfalls and four virtues in human nature taught daily by Mr. Chan. The four pitfalls that we have to watch out and refrain from are selfishness, stubbornness, laziness and pettiness” All very nice and fine. But perhaps someone should advise Mr Chan to expand it to six virtues and include dishonesty and non-attentiveness. The assistant captain was very economical with the truth. Instead of a proper explanation or attempting to find a solution, she insisted our group squeeze onto a small table and kept insisting a 5ft-diameter table was same with a 6ft-one. She was walking not around with a dog and a cane, so I knew her eyesight was ok. The hostess eventually came and after admitting that the table was a smaller one, moved us to a larger table.The waitresses are universally inattentive. You do get refills on the chinese tea, if you ever see your waitress. Our inattentive server not only failed to refill empty glasses, they did not even notice that we were trying ot order some additional things. Overall, service underwhelming but not completely disappointing.It’s too bad. Beautiful restaurant, food was yummy, but the staff need an overhau.(www.perfyi.wordpress.com
