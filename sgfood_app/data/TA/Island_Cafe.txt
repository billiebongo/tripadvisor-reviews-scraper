A nice place to zest up after a shopping spree at Tangs. Food is great and service is excellent. Especially love the cozy ambience!

Located at 4F of Tanglin, Orchard and I visited there for lunch. Very neat and clean Cafe. My favorite dish Laksa tasted so good and cost S$32.00 with a glass of Tiger beer.

This ‚Äòatas‚Äô (uppity) cafe on the 4th floor of Tangs is completely in line with the beauty shops on that floor, exclusive, over-priced but with great ambience. The mains are substantial, you get a large helping with the lamb nasi briyani and nasi lemak. These two dishes are the most value for money, the basmati rice in the bryani is well cooked with separate grains as it should be and the lamb shank tender and flavourful with a great brown sauce. The achar hoever was minuscule and not that fresh while the pappadam had gone soft. My friend‚Äôs nasi lemak looked appetising with rendang, fried chicken I think and the usual egg, cumcumber and ikan bills and peanuts, didn‚Äôt get a chance to sample it though as the bryani was filling. On another occasion I ordered the crab tanghoon which turned out to be a disappointing soft shell crab that had hardly any meat.Warm and cold water was served by request and we had Cappucino afterwards, large and strong but base price of $6 each.Ambience is good if there are no screaming kids but it‚Äôs quite popular with families so you might not be able to avoid discordant noise. Good thing is you can sit almost forever so good for catching up with friends. Pleasant service from the young ladie

Local food shouldn‚Äôt have to cost so much, even at a fancy restaurant. Island cafe has pretty good food at reasonable portions, so if you wanna have some local food and don‚Äôt mind paying 3x the price you‚Äôd normally get, island cafe is your go-to. Best dish was the tahu telor! Not common in local restaurants

There's a nice selection of local favourites - Nasi goreng, beef Hor fun, Kueh pie tee and more. The ambience is really comfortable with an option of outdoor balcony seating, which isn't practical on a hot Singapore day. The quality of the food was somewhat disappointing and the prices rather high. The salted egg fries weren't crispy and it just seemed very solid and tasteless. There's a nice deal with a dessert selection for 2 for $15 with 8 pieces of local Nyonya sweets but these didn't taste as fresh and fragrant as they should. Service was polite but slow.

Island Caf√© at Tangs is a great place to bring your overseas guests to sample good Singapore food. In fact, this is just a good excuse as I would go there for a comfortable place to eat our local fare.Besides the usual kueh pie tee, laksa and hainanese chicken rice, their signature dishes include a unique black pepper crab tang hoon, which I will visit them for solely. It is so fragrant and tasty with lots of "wok hei" (the flavour of stir frying in a well-used wok), not too peppery and they are generous with crab meat and a soft-shelled crab.Their portions are large and hence excellent for family-style sharing. In case your visitors are not too adventurous with local dishes, they also serve salads, burgers and kids menu such as chicken macaroni.The prices are more like hotel cafes but I reckon Island's food taste more authentic and delicious. They are situated at the fourth floor of Tangs shopping mall with a very pleasant d√©cor complete with a nice outdoor corridor. There's a long table for a large family or small tour bus or just for sharing with strangers. Service is very friendly

Island Cafe has been a legend for local food for many years in Tangs. In this new-ish revamped version, the menu is much smaller and really pricey. The local food is acceptable in quality and portion size but not outstanding. The non -alcoholic drinks are eye-wateringly expensive. The staff are kept very busy and are quite inattentive but are very sweet and obliging when they finally come to the table to take orders. Given the much better alternatives elsewhere, even on pricey Orchard Road, visits to Island Cafe will be an occasional treat as opposed to being a regular place to visit like in the old days

Completely re-decorated so that entrance is easier to find. The new decor is in keeping with the times and island deco. Kudos!The char kway teow was awesome! now I can;t remember what else we ate. Pork belly bun? that was great. Kuay pie tee was ok. Chendol? was also o

Visited this cafe for lunch and was pleasantly served by Li Mei.She is patient, accomodating, detailed and knows her menu well to recommend it well. She was detailed and efficient in serving and ensuring we had a good dining experience. A great place for a taste of local food coupled with excellent service. A place that makes dining a pleasure
4
Extremely generous portions that can be shared between 2. Always on promotions make it extra sweet for those on a budget yet want to dine in a lovely setting.
4
The atmosphere is super good and I love the black pepper glass noodle! Their price is reasonable for such great atmosphere!
5
The Island Cafe is exactly that. And Island of calm on Orchard Road. Soothing decor, great service and lovely food. There's a good mix of Western and Asian food. I chose the Mediterranean salad and carrot and ginger juice. Both awesome.
4
Great fusion menu of SE Asia and a lovely place to escape off Orchard Road. If you are looking for a place that is quiet to relax, share a light meal or be romantic or just have a business conversation, this is a great place for all! The spicy crab dip with sweet buns and the chicken rice are recommended. Service was very polite and kind-- they also made sure to be hands-on when needed and "hands-off" when not needed. The evening crowd was minimal, so this made a great place to catch up with an old friend
1
Had dinner here, was looking forward to good food because of the high price. ordered indonesian fried rice but the rice tasted sour. brought this up to the waiter and he checked with the cook. The cook denied any problem with the food. was disappointed that nothing much was done to rectify the problem, no one offered to replace our food or compensate with something else. So ended paying $20 for fried rice which we did not touch. Will not return again
4
Oh gosh, ain't it all slick now with a nice sliver of a view of Orchard Road surrounds. The perfect lunch spot to rest and catch up from the hustle and bustle before you re-enter urbane civilization. The good stuff is all there still albeit a tad more expensive. I went for the crab tang hoon (my fave for a decade) and the sago pearls in Gula Melaka (Asian brown molasses) which they could be more generous with! Anyway, it's still a swell spot for lunch in Orchard Road.

The island cafe has been a longtime favorite for my family & this year they underwent renovations to remodel the cafe. The menu has changed slightly as well and has become more westernized instead of a localized menu. That being said the food is still delicious & come in large portions- the chicken rice is a must try!
3
Now I would not have step into here knowing that they charge exorbitant prices for hawker food It's a nice place for a good conversation with friends but not for meals please Overall food is moderate and service is mediocre at its best For that kind of prices , we could be better off with much fancier cafe around orchard
3
Food wise i think is decent, a cosy place to meet up with friends over food. Friendly waiters and service is quite prompt. They had a peanut butter milkshake just like the one i had in sydney.. Though a tad to sweet nonetheless enjoyed it very much.
3
Good cafe food but on the pricier side!Recommend to order asian dishes like the the laksa, char kway teow. Definitely a place to go if you like to shop and eat as it's on the top floor or Tangs Plaza and if you like to have more refined hawker centre eats.Would not advise having burgers here nor the fish and chips. One of the worst fish and chips I've had with 70% flour and soggy fries
5
I was here for dessert after walking at TANGS, a beautiful departmental stores w everything in house. I ordered the 24K Gold brownie while relaxing myself at their cozy outdoor sofa. Worth a trip over if u r in orchard !
4
Like the tauhu telor n food presentation.., coffee n halo halo is not bad..Overall a nice decoration and good services too
4
Located on the upper floor of the department store, I was thankful it was not very busy. The restaurant team member who showed me to my seat indulged me with my choice of table.The d√©cor was slick and the overall ambience was clinical. I especially liked the light piece above the cashier's. I was a little disappointed that my favourite chicken rice dish was unavailable. But no matter as it worked out well. As an alternative, I ordered the noodles instead. The restaurant indulged me as I preferred it with fish slices instead of seafood. Overall, a satisfying experience
3
As you walk into the cafe, wow it was so bright & well decorated with new furnishings. Ordered fried kuay teow, chicken rice & prawn noodles. The freshly slow squeezed juices were good. Fried noodles very oily, prawn noodles had tiny prawns & chicken rice was too wet.

The revamped Island Cafe at Tangs Orchard is a lovely oasis in the heart of town. It serves mainly Singaporean and regional dishes and is beautifully lit, with the floor-to-ceiling windows letting in a lot of natural light. The cafe is also quiet and inviting, a nice spot for a break in between shopping or a lazy weekend brunch.Since it was the Chinese New Year season, we ordered the festive special of Yu Sheng with Abalone, Snow Pear & Lychee ($38++ for two to four people), which also comes with mandarin oranges, pomelo, deep-fried yam and pickles. It was a large portion and the three of us could not finish it. We liked that it wasn‚Äôt too sweet, and the addition of snow pear and lychee was refreshing, but it would have been better if there were more pieces of fruit.Our Gado ($16) was possibly mislabelled as it came almost completely covered in keropok (not emping crackers, as in the menu) and I had to push them aside to see the vegetables. There was no pumpkin, quinoa or edamame, as in the menu, and the egg was not fried either. There was mainly cabbage, an egg, a little tempeh, tofu, long beans and carrot. Quite a disappointment as the ingredients in the description sounded more unusual ‚Äì this was definitely not worth its price.The other dishes we ordered were fine though, and the service and ambience are good. Worth a try, but make sure your order arrives with the ingredients stated on the menu.For photos and more reviews, visit hungrybaker.c

We have been going here almost since its beginning, for its very good rendering of local dishes. Overall, the makeover is welcome; the restaurant now looks much brighter - an oasis of calm on Orchard Road. They still maintain many of their signature dishes (prawn mee, nasi lemak, laksa, etc). Prices have increased quite a bit, but are still reasonable for the area. They took away the delicious and somewhat unique crab vermicelli. Clientele is mainly Asian, so don't know why they bothered to include steak frites? Who would come to Island Cafe to eat this dish? Better leave it to the specialists
2
As a long time fan of Island Cafe and Tank's supporter, my first meal in the new renovated Island Cafe was a disappointment. I liked the new decor and service was as always friendly and efficient BUT food was such a let down. Prices had gone up a bit but this was matched with richer ingredients. Sadly, all of that was for nought, as the food was bland and completely lacked flavor. Am hopeful, that Tang's will get this fixed ASAP so Island Cafe can return to its former glory. Good Luck.

I used to tell people that the island cafe had the best beef black bean hor fun in Singapore. The hor fun is made with wagyu beef and really melts in the mouth. I was really disappointed when the restaurant closed for renovations and I regularly checked to see if it had reopened. When I realised it finally reopened, we immediately went for our fix of beef hor fun.The interior is nice: plantation style light wood combined with withe and even some exterior spaces. The hor fun unfortunately was a lot less nice: the rice noodles were overdone and stuck together in lumps, the beef was stringy and the taste in general was a lot less refined than it used to be. At SGD 24 pp and with ++ (it used to be SGD 20 before the renovation), we paid over SGD 56 for two average hor funs with ice water. That was just too much for the quality of the food
4
Went back to Island Cafe after a long time. It has been renovated and seemed a little smaller. To their credit their food quality has improved quite a bit. The chicken in the nasi lemak for example, was much nicer than previously. What kind of affected the experience was the absolute inexperience of all the student waiters and waitresses. And really, the food is way overpriced. Nasi lemak for $24
4
Visited island cafe for the first time after its renovation! The interior is very resort- like and much more spacious and airy compared to the past where I recalled there were a number of pillars in the dining space. Love the outdoor area and the beachfront kind of couches where you can just hang out and chill with your girlfriends after shopping or just over a drink or 2.Was served with the keropok (crackers) with satay sauce dip - great complimentary appetiser :)Ordered the grilled sambal fish with coconut rice- really fragrant and delicious! You have to try it :)Pop by to try out this newly renovated resort + restaurant all in one in the heart of Orchard road
5
Its all about the experience, a great place to chill out after a hard day at work.
Attentive staff and great service. Will definitely go back again to enjoy the embience.

Island Caf√© in the department store is okay. I ordered the satay and it was really good. The food is reasonably priced for a decent meal.

In the last 2 weeks we have been here 3 times. The first time was just OK and nothing more.On all 3 occasions the food for the diners arrived separately and the food was getting cold whilst we waited for the full order. On our 2nd visit a group on a nearby table waited 45 minutes for their meal only to discover the order had not been placed with the kitchen. On the 3rd visit I ordered Chiken Scnitzel. I asked if instead of salad if I could have fries. The answer was that it is a set meal and changes are not allowed. I requested a side dish of fries and was told they had to be sweet potatoes. On arrival they were normal fries made with the usual potatoes. It is not restaurant we shall return to. The physical refurbishment is very good but the menu has been significantly reduced. Sadly the service does not live up to the decor. The food when it was eventually served was very average

This cafe has just been reopened in December 2015after renovations.The cafe looks very bright & smart now.There is also a bar now.This cafe serves both local dishes and some westernfare too. Please the attached photos of the menu foran idea.There are daily specials of popular local dishes too.For our our lunch, all three of us opted for their ChristmasTurkey set which included lobster bisque, roasted turkey slices with canberry sauce,yam ball stuffed with chestnuts, glutinuous rice with chopped liver & sweet potato mashglazed with maple syrup.For dessert, there was lychee raspberry yule log cake.Coffee or tea rounded up the set meal.There were sufficient wait staff and therefore servicewas prompt & attentive.This cafe seems to be popular as it filled up fairlyquickly and because of its compact layout, thebackground chatter can be loud.Overall a pleasant dining experience

One of my favourite restaurant in the heart of Orchard with great local and western food with reasonable price.It has recently reopened after 3 month refurbishment work. I would actually prefer the old decor but the food is the reason for my visit.Sad to find some of my old favourites missing; namely Reuben sandwich. To my surprise Cendol was already sold out at 12:30pm. You can imagine the crowd support for this little jewel.The food is still great and suggest to go early to avoid any disappointment

With a relaxing island decor, this sit-down restaurant is located on the upper floor of the Tangs department store. The menu consists mainly of local foods like gado gado, tauhu telor, chicken rice, etc. For desserts, try the gula melaka.The servers are polite. However, the service is sometimes not as prompt. We had a difficult time waving to a server and instead had to walk up to them instead. But, their service was always polite
4
Tug on the 4th floor of CK Tang, this place has a nice ambience and is not usually packed. The place is decorated with alot of wood with nice spot lights here and there giving you a very homely and warmth feel.Prices may be slightly expensive for local food but the food is well cooked and the serving portion is generous
4
A lovely place for a fete-a-tete and nice selection of local delights. The surrounds if you can get a window seat is full of greenery and one could imagine being in a conservatory for lunch or dinner. I love this place and use it quite a lot especially when I have overseas visitors. It's so convenient to either shop before or after having a nice meal! They are mostly pleasantly surprised.Staff are very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. There is also a mini licenced bar if one fancies a beer or wine

Lunar New Year is around the corner, I was with colleague eating dinner here.Lou Hei at the Island Cafe is about $38++ which is rather expensive for a simple dish. The salmon was fresh but the sauce was too sweet. Disappointing dinner here, Indonesia Fried Rice was so soPork Chop Rice was saltyCrayfish Laksa sauce was too thickAvoid coming here if possibleMore pictures on my blog:http://www.msw-nvm.blogspot.com/2015/02/island-cafe-tangs-orchard-singapore.htm

premise - quaint and rustic design. Gives you the 'island' feel as the theme suggests. Nestled on the top floor of CK Tangs.location - centrally plonked at CK Tangs, carpark is a breeze everywhere.staff - friendly as most of CK Tangs staff.crowd - couples / friendsverdict - it's quite good and there are choices for the food for your selection. You can even pay using the Tangs voucher! portion was good enough to share between friends so order 1 dish less and go into a share fest! desserts are also OK and they are currently having this offer for a fruit dessert which really went well as an ending to a happy dinner! :

$6 SGD for 2 fresh prawns set among in dark yellow noodles. I think the environment was really clean and I enjoyed the food too.
5
Did not disappoint. Best laksa, hainanese chicken was great, so was the crayfish fried rice. Nice location beside Lucky plaza. Staff were very courteous and helpful. Two thumbs up.

Situated at top level of Tangs, quiet and secluded from shopping district downstairs. Food offering is plain simple and usual local dishes. Pricey for the quality and quantity offered.

I have been eating at this place since I was a child. I take my overseas guests there almost all the time because it has a good selection of both western and local favourites at good prices and excellent quality.My personal favourite dish there is Crayfish Laksa. The gravy is superb! But it is a large portion, so you must be hungry to order it. You can opt to have it without the crayfish too. Still good.I had Caesar's Salad on my last visit. Excellent too! Was just the right food for a late dinner. My two friends had Reuben sandwich on rye bread and were very happy. One of them could not finish the sandwich. He said it was a very big portion.We were served by a nice waiter wearing a black shirt. My guess is he is the supervisor. I didn't get a chance to get his name, but he served us on 29 August 2014 in the evening. He was friendly, helpful and funny too. We asked him to take our photo and asked us instead to take a "selfie", making us laugh. Shortly after, two young ladies at the next table also asked him to take their photo. After he had taken the photo, he said, "Kawaii ne..." (Japanese for "cute"). He just livened up the whole atmosphere.I will continue to patronise this place. One of my all-time favourites

Interesting to find the cafe tucked in the Tangs shopping mall. Setting of the cafe is comfortable. Quite a good range of local food. The food quality, portion and presentation was good. I had hainanese chicken rice with Moroccan mint tea. I had especially enjoyed the tea. We also shared a platter with spring rolls, fried wanton, satay and fried chicken wings. As I am not a big fan of deep fried food, I had only enjoyed the satay.Nevertheless, was still an enjoyable meal.
4
Liked this place a lot. Service was reasonably fast, decor pleasant and staff helpful. Food was good quality and tasty. Nice place to rest from the heat. We ordered asian platter (satay skewers, spring rolls, won tons & chikn wings) and a crayfish fried rice. Soft drinks reasonable at SIN$3..
2
We were brought here by a colleague. The lychee mojitos weren't good. The starters of satay and fried tofu was ok. Most of us had the laksa and a local colleague found the tofu sour, which meant past the expiry date. Our american friends unknowingly had most of it and ended with diarrhoea that night. Never agai
4
I have eaten here a number of times on various trips and enjoy the food- main courses as well as desserts and drinks- but service seems to be mostly trainees and their English pronunciation is at times hard to understand- but Overall a comfortable place with good food at an ok price.
3
With aching feet, I hesitantly found my way into Island Cafe in Tang. Ordered the Indonesian fried rice which was a whole meal by itself. Portion was good. Taste was good. Spice level was adjusted for tourists. Overall, quite a good experience. Ice water was topped up every time I finished the whole glass. The heat in Singapore can dehydrate a person. Overall, if you find your way in Tang's and too tired to look for somewhere else to eat, then Island cafe is not a bad idea

My wife and I were looking at the Christmas decorations for sale on the 4th floor of Tang's, and we decided to try the small but inviting Island Cafe on the same floor. It was raining heavily at the time, and we were hungry. We guessed that Tang's would ensure that high quality food was available for their in-store restaurant, much the same as Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, and Nieman Marcus often provide high quality cafes for their shoppers. My wife ordered crab bisque which was quite good. I was intrigued by a turkey, cranberry, and peach sandwich which was disappointing. Instead of a juicy slice of turkey, they provided a small fried turkey patty. Instead of tangy cranberries, they put in whole berries. There was a lot more bread than food between the slices. We tried lemongrass and lychee drinks with mint which were unusual. The service was better than average, and the food was average. Tang's could upgrade the quality of food at Island Cafe to attract hungry shoppers away from department stores that are in larger shopping centers
