This is a perfect package: best food, best service, best price, excellent location and very short waitI had the chicken curry with rice, and it was the best I have ever had, the price was very reasonable Singapore has many restaurants and many options, I get really excited when I stumble upon the perfect gem, not an easy tas

Came here for a quick take-away baguette for lunch today at about 12.30pm. There were about 6 people ahead of me in the queue, but it moved fairly quickly. After paying for my grilled chicken wholemeal baguette ($6.80) I then had a short wait of about 5 mins until it was ready. All quite tasty, but probably a little on the small side and some extra food might be needed to supplement. Tempted to come back and try the noodles

I have been visiting this food joint from last few years and always loved the food. Taste is amazing and perfect flavours of sweet and sour.Viet curry chicken rice is a must try and surely you will not regret it. All the varieties of baguette are equally good .Soda Chanh is a awesome drink to beat the heat. Overall must try this joint for yummy food
