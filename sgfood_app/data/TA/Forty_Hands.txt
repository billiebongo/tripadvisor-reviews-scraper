The main course is above average. The dish that stands out for me would be the chili crab fries. There is usually a queue around brunch time.
3
These guys are the slowest service in Singapore, which if you know singapore means that they are deathly slow.
Food was actually nice, big boy breakfast. But my hot drink was cold by the time it arrived.
5
This great little cafe served us the best coffee we had in Singapore. Definitely worth a visit for a delicious brunch and a coffee!
4
As a non-coffee drinker; I can't comment much. The dessert has actually impressed me so much that I found my coming hangout place wannabe
4
Good deserts and great black coffee
The chilli eggs is abit disappointing but the French toast is awesome
5
Hands down the best coffee I have ever tasted. This gem is tucked away and is easily missed. The compact nature of this cafe adds to the fantastic buzz inside. The menu choices are amazing and the coffee is next level. A must visit and Highly recommend
5
During our hipster coffee hop around Tiong Bahru we found ourselves in the buzzing Forty Hands. We noticed there were lots of chilli crab fries orders flying through the counter so - even though we’d just finished coffee and cake - we had some. Chilli crab is a ‘must’ when in Singapore apparently, and was on our bucket list. And oh my goodness how nice they were - so much so that we ordered ourselves seconds.
3
Went for a walk with a friend and ended up goin to FortyHands for breakfast. I ordered Egg Benedict with bacon and some potatoes on the side. The food was delicious and good enough to satisfy my morning cravings. Latte was Nicely done. Staff are friendly and attentive to their guests needs. Laidback atmosphere and good if you just want to relax, or just get a quick breakfast.Would recommend
3
Our second visit to Forty Hands. Came back for the coffee which is always good. This time, however, we were very disappointed. Whilst the smashed avo on toast tasted as good as last time, the serving size was way smaller. And forget toast - this was warm bread. Can’t be that hard to toast bread properly. The 40 Hands Cubanos was a shocker. Dry and served in a baguette that had to be yesterday’s if not the day before’s !! Not on at the prices they charge. Will NOT be going back despite the great coffee
4
Taken to this cafeThe area is brilliant and a must visit Back to the cafeThe coffee flavour is great and def the best I have had here in Singapore but the temp is not good More like a warm iced coffee It seems temperature of food in Singapore isn’t a priority but that hasn’t been an issue Atmosphere awesomeDidn’t try the food but it looked great
5
Love this place. The avocado on toast is huge and delicious. Can’t recommend highly enough and have a wander around Tiong Bahru while you’re there.
4
Good solid breakfast and coffee. Worth a visit if your looking for a well made eggs breakfast meal...
5
Food was fantastic, Coffee best in Singapore, service quiet and efficient perfect for a Sunday morning. A return to place
3
We had our last lunch in Singapore here. It located at good position, easy to get here. Nice cuisine, good food and friendly staffs. Recommend Eggs Benidict - simple but impressing taste.
4
Went there for a lazy Sunday brunch with family. All dishes freshly prepared and arrived quickly. Tasty and yummy. Attentive service. The batch brew (black coffee) was nice but not hot enough.
Recommendable place, will come again.
5
Awesome little coffee house in a trendy ex-pat area. A little tight in space but nonetheless a cozy spot with a great vibe. And, of course the coffee is great. Breakfast plates were also amazing and large in portion.
5
Located conveniently within Tiong Bahru. Car parking was available behind the outlet at the open air carpark.The general portions were adequate although may have been a little big for Asian standards but was nonetheless flavourful and of good quality. The orange juice was fresh although felt it was a little too small a portion for the price. Would consider going back again in future
5
Amongst all the cafes I have visited, this is arguably one of the better ones. I ordered a long black for my coffee, and it didn't disappoint. The big boy breakfast set was also amazing. My girl and I had such a great time here! Would love to visit again
4
I have been here before and I keep coming back at Forty Hands. I useally go for the Eggs Benedict which I really love, this time I tried something complete different: the homemade Granola...mmmm....very delicious! Next time will be difficult to choose what I should order!
5
I brought my cafe-loving friends from Bangkok here for a Sunday brunch, and they loved it! Though it is abit cramp, the atmosphere was lively, food was good, and service was excellent. I had the Big Boy Breakfast (scrambled eggs, toasties, sausage, mushroom ragout, tomatoes and crispy bacon) - which could easily feed 2 persons. My friend's Chili Scram (scrambled eggs on toast) and Banana Bacon French Toast were equally tasty.Highly recommended for brunch and/or coffee, but be prepared to queue over weekend
4
It's open later than other coffee shops which I like! We will definitely come back here quite often for the coffee , atmosphere and the staff are nice. I didn't like the banana walnut cake, it was soggy ... not good.
5
Just love the coffee! Probably served the best coffee in town! Cozy and nice place to have a cup of coffee with your friends! Friendly staff and friendly food!
4
Took the family here while on holiday in Singapore, coffee was excellent , steamed buns with pork where seasoned . Eggs delicious. Cool place off the tourist route. Great food court near bye to walk around. Loved it
4
Nice place to find all-day breakfast. This place is quite noisy and very small.I ordered Salmon Hash (Poached salmon in creamy potato, mustard sauce, pan-fried onions, homemade pepita toast served with fries) and Iced ChocolateThe Salmon Hash was nice but a bit creamy but the iced chocolate i ordered is the nicest iced chocolate i ever had
5
Expensive compared to nearby hawker centres (although this is brunch in Singapore) but amazing coffee and the best avocado toast ever - do not miss! One was enough to feed two very hungry people. On a cute street, so look at the book vending machine and see if you can save room for a cupcake across the street
4
I recommend Forty Hands simply because they have the best Tau Sar Pau in Singapore! If you don't like eating sweet stuff in the morning, I strongly recommend you to try their egg benedict with steak or beacon together with a cup of coffee. They open at 7:30 am serving all kind of western style breakfast. The price is very reasonable and the environment is decent.
4
Nestled in Tiong Bahru estate . A nice cafe , small , cramp , and definitely well packed. Seems small but walk to the end to find another sitting area. Pretty cool as it gives the experience of an old 'shophouse' design . Coffee & food is good. Only snag is that it can be a bit noisy . Definitely hipster joint ... it's well ok as Long as the coffee is good . There's also a bookstore across the cafe .. so give that a shot too after the dose . And , car Parks not an issue as there is a public car park at the back of the shop .
5
We came here during our visit to the upcoming hipster area of tiong bahru following reading the reviews here - it didn't disappoint! Felt like you could be sitting in a Cafe in Camden in London - very cool and western place full if plenty of tourists and locals alike. Great menu selection of many western options, and wonderful coffee. Couldn't recommend enough!
3
I stayed at an apartment just around the corner of this Cafe and decided to give it a try for breakfast. Ordered the Big Boy Breakfast with 2 eggs sunny side up. Well, for the first time I have ever seen, the eggs were served sunny side down. I thought may be there's a way to eat it without breaking the yoke but proven impossible. Also, the sautÃ©ed mushroom was too salty to eat by itself.
5
Went for family breaki, and it was a highlight of our holiday! Granola served w yogurt and fruit tasty and generous serve; the asparagus salad so tasty, and the eggs were perfect, but the absolute highlight was the ban mi Viet style steam buns with slow roasted/braised pork belly. Absolutely to die for! So good we actually stayed and ordered a second helping, with extra buns! (The serve of 3 buns wasn't enough bun to hold such a big generous portion of melt in the mouth pork). Total winner. All accompanied by delicious coffee. Perfection. Order the pork!!!!!
5
I had the granola and fresh fruits breakfast and my Friend had the pesto chicken sandwich. We loved our meals and the atmosphere. The cappuccino was good too. Will definitely revisit :)
5
Great macchiato in an interesting neighbourhood with a lot of history. Eggs Benedict was tasty and granola was also pretty good.
5
Highly recommend this cafe - my meal was amazing, coffee was great (and for an Aussie, that's important!) and the street has some great little boutiques.
5
Really cool little place that we will definitely visit again. Great brunch. Tasty food. Really cool atmosphere. Loved it. Totally different to most places on Singapore so really worth a visit.
3
A good place to hang out with your friends or when you just want some time to yourself.
The food is a bit of a hit and miss. Sometimes it's good and sometimes it can be better. Had the falalel this time. Dry and disappointing.
5
The place may be small and what may look cramped especially during peak hours, but it is indeed a lovely place for a nice cup of coffee with light bites on a hot afternoon. Came here at about 4pm and there was still quite a number of people, shows how good of a quality this place has.Prices for food ranges from $13 (coachella crab fries) to $20 (salmon hash). Drinks are from $4 (coffee) to $15 (sparkling wine). Although they may have a full menu on their website, you'll be treated to a delightful surprise at the counter with cakes (probably different each day since it's not on the menu). The food and ambiance is a perfect bait for instagramers I guess, with brick walls etc.There is no service charge so don't expect their staff to walk up to you to take orders. Honestly, I prefer it that way. Furthermore, their staff are all pleasant and always exchanging smiles.Would definitely recommend this place for coffee-lovers and instagramers
5
This is a cute, quirky cafe tucked away in a little corner. Service was fantastic, food was fantastic and they had great value for money. After spending two weeks traveling around Asia my partner and I were trying to find a nice place to have bacon and eggs for breakfast! Forty hands hit the spot!
5
It took me a while to find the place; it is in the heart of Tiong Bahru residence. If I will be living in this area, I'll be number one fan. Creative cakes - carrot & sweet potato cake, moreover, red bean bun is no doubt a must!!! Staff friendly, atmosphere cosy and somehow Zurich's Niederdoerfli. If you are done with Orchard Rd and all this shopping malls, this is THE perfect place to enjoy your coffee and afternoon. An unforgettable experience and moment.
4
The coffee is why we came back - braving the early evening rush from the central business district to Tiong Bahru. Forty Hands is an intimate coffee bar albeit almost always packed and noisy with patrons. Walking around this neighborhood is therapeutic and coffee is a good complement to the environment.
4
Love this place each time I am in this area. Coffee is great and the sandwich is one of the best here. U can pay by credit card and the plain water is on the house. Take note cafe shuts at 6pm and you can park behind the place in the public carpark
5
Good breakfast stop and very popular with locals. Granola with fruit excellent, coffee great quality as is the orange juice. Croissants a treat. Altogether a good option.
3
We came for after lunch coffee, and the line was quite packed. Had to wait for around 20mins before we got to be seated.
Tried the cold-brew and found nothing special with it.
Place is a bit noisy, but maybe it's because the rush hour.
4
Easy to locate,1 busstop away from Tiong Bahru mrt! No much food choice very typical hipster cafe in this Neighbourhood! But staff was friendly and nice!
5
Great spot for a break or even do some work in a trendy yet quiet space, great shops around the area for a full visit to the neighborhood.
4
Great little cafe owned by a West Australian. If your in Tiong Bahru and need a caffeine fix, check it out.
4
Located around tiong bahru area . They offer coffee from common man . Do try their famous egg ben with juciy beef steak .
4
We had the Eggs Benedict with bacon, banana French toast and 2 large mochas. All were very tasty and service was excellent. It was very, very good, but for $35 USD, it was definitely not cheap (hence the reason for only 4 stars).
3
Nice looking place, in a very nice neighbourhood.You have to wait a bit for a table so your expectations become a bit higher.Food on the menu looks good but unfortunately the taste isn't that great.The Avo on toast didn't have a nice structure and was to creamy.Veggie salad was really bad and tasteless.A pity because the place has a nice atmosphere
4
Even this place is not near our hotel at all, but we love to go there. Heard many good recommend for this place as one of the good for coffee cafe that you should visit when you go to Singapore. The food and the coffee is impressed us. You should try. Better to go early for holiday, otherwise will be wait for long
5
This is my favorite place to go for brunch and I always take my friends here. It's cute, the food is yummy, and the coffee is great too! There's usually a short wait on saturday mornings so go on a weekday if possible. There's lot of other cute shops nearby to stop by too :
4
They have a lovely and simple brunch menu. We ordered the eggs Benedict and salmon hash, and both were outstanding. It's a bit pricey, and has a waiting time- so be prepared. But the wait is worth it. Ambience is cheerful, but the place is small and cozy enough that you'll hear parts of conversation from other tables
4
I would come here for breakfast or brunch every day if I could. Fantastic coffee. Decadent eggs benedict (maybe a little too much meat), exquisite eggs-florentine-type dish. Awesome Caesar Salad. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 just because it's a little annoying how you have to jockey for a table without any host's help, and you have to order at a counter the moment you walk in the door or people get annoyed, and the prices are the same as a regular restaurant. The food couldn't be better and comes very quickly
4
I tried egg Benedict as others recommended, it's really delicious, but I think the potato is just average, maybe I should try spicy next time. In general,it's a great place to enjoy brunch and the coffee is also good which reminds me of the coffeeshops in Melbourne
3
Caveat - I'm from Melbourne, so have issues with poorly run cafes as there's simply no excuse for it.I've been here a number of times now (a Tiong Bahru local) and something always goes wrong.Sure, the coffee is okay (if with milk...horrendously fruity as an espresso), but have had to chase something every time. The latest visit was a 40 minute wait for sandwiches while our friends sat and ate in front of us - chased it three times and the staff simply did't care; I'm not sure if it's arrogance, ignorance, or a mix of both. Either way, there are simple solutions to a restaurant screwing up, and ineffective silence is the worst thing you can do.Hugely disappointing and inexplicably popular for a place with such a good reputation.There are cafes in Singapore doing it significantly better than these guys, but if you set your expectations to "mediocre", they'll hit the mark for you
5
This is a great place for brunch or snacks. The food is really great - huge breakfasts and a range of sandwiches and drinks. I had a delicious eggs benedict with bacon. It was really good. The seating isn't wildly comfortable - mainly high tables with narrow stools and you often have to share, but it doesn't matter as the ambience is great - friendly and a little quirky. My only complaint is the coffee - I know lots of people like it but I find it bitter, so my solution is to go for a large size coffee which is better. Highly recommend this place and while you are there spend a bit of time walking around the area which is a low rise, Art Deco part of Singapore.
3
Funky little cafe with three seating areas. Outside, main floor near the counter and indoor courtyard. Breakfast came out at lightening speed. I'd say within two minutes of me seating down. Presentation is on the mark but disappointed when I started tucking in that the avocado was brown, toast stone cold and eggs cold. Which is a shame because the breakfast is delicious but cold and makes me think they gave me a breakfast that someone didn't want. Coffee is okay but drinkable. Total cost : $27.50 including taxes. I'd come back but hopefully next time I'll get a warm breakfast.
5
I went on a sunday exploration of tiong bahru and found this coffee place. Its small and has quite a cool industrial look and feel. It was buzzing with folks. They serve coffee and have a menut of what looked like great brunch options but i ordered just a coffee (had already made the mistake of having lunch -lol). Has a double macchiato. It was really good. I enjoyed it. Its a great little place and i will return for some brunch next time!RegardsOma
5
40 hands is not your vegan/vegetarian friendly choice but it is nice enough to get a drink or coffee and e.g. Their falafel could be a good choice. Even if there is a line waiting outside it is pretty fast to get into. Staff is friendly and helpful, even at their full capacity their serving is fast
4
Nothing out of the box by hipster standards but the coffee is good and the varied menu is good and the version of a caesar salad I had was generous and tasty. Worth going there as part of visiting this groovy old school part of 1930s Singapore that somehow escaped the bulldozers
4
40Hands is tucked away in a corner of Tiong Bahru and may need some serious Google Maps-ing to get there, but it's totally worth it.They have a wonderful brunch menu, with multiple appealing vegetarian options. We were a few of us, got Truffle Fries to share, and individually, ordered the Eggs & Mushrooms, Avocado Toast, Chilli Scram, and Mochas to drink. All the dishes were really well done, the portions sneakily large, so by the end of it, we were all really full and satiated
4
Just around the corner from where we are staying in Tiong Bahru it is well positioned away from most of the hub bub and is great for a morning coffee. Small but interesting.
4
Had an awesome brunch with my friends on a Sunday. It was busy but we managed to get a seat rather quickly. Try their Big Boy Breakfast. Portion is rather huge. Tau Sar Pau is a must-try too.
5
It was well worth the MRT trip out to Tiong Bahru to have lunch at forty hands. The place was tucked away and not overly obvious from the street front. Opening the door revealed that the place was packed - a good sign. Inside it was a little cramped, maximising space for as many customers as possible, but comfortable and trendy. The salads were interesting, delicious and hearty. Good menu and fresh cake selection too.
4
Located in the hip Tiong Bahru area, this place can be packed to the brim if your timing isn't right. My bet would be to visit it early or even if you can't, you can always stroll around the area before heading back to the cafe. The coffee tastes good although you might bump elbows with the person next to you but nevertheless, a place to chill with a cup of mocha
5
This is my 2nd time in place. It's a little hard to get to because of the location from the mrt station. However, it's worth the walk. Coffee was so good as always and I tried their sandwich this time around after landing in Singapore for late lunch.
3
My first visit here was 3 years ago.. the coffee was really very very good but somehow... It's not as nice anymore. The coffee seems a little too acidic and even though it was just served... It was Luke warm.I kinda expect more when the price has gone up a dollar. Sorry... Forty Hands...
4
WOW!! What a revelation Yong Siak Street in Tiong Bahru was!!Two great bookshops, a great bakery and Forty Hands.We called in to Forty Hands for a bite in the middle of the day.....not exactly brunch but more than a nibble. What a find......and the place was packed with a wide demographic apparent....students, a family, girls for goss, young couples and a couple from Oz. And when I say packed, standing room only.The menu was quite extensive considering the size of the place.We settled for fresh juices made in front of us, and served in a jar, and sparkling water served over ice with lemon.She had The Megs Salad which contained roasted sweet potato, baby spinach, bacon, macadamia nuts, feta cheese and asparagus with garlic mustard dressing. The sweet potato, asparagus and dressing were exquisite. It might have been improved with a strip of bacon rather than bacon bits?? Nevertheless, a fresh satisfying dish and good sized serve.He had a cheese & tomato sandwich but not as boring as it sounds....Emmental, Jarlsberg, and cheddar cheese with lettuce and tomato on homemade pepita toast. It is usually served with chips which I avoided but added the ham, and there was plenty of it. A step well above the usual "toastie".Well done to all the young staff who were attentive and pleasant to their patrons. They and the food take Forty Hands well above the suburban café.When in Singapore go find Yong Siak Street in Tiong Bahru!!
5
We had a Saturday Lunch here. You need to get here a little before peak times if you don't want to queue for a table. We had the pork sliders - they were fantastic! Desserts also looked good! Had the bacon cheesecake nice but not very bacon flavoured
4
Many blame Forty Hands for the still growing coffee culture in Singapore for good reason. They serve excellent coffee. Located some distance away from the busy side of Tiong Bahru - sitting next to independent bookshops, a yoga studio and local mom and pop stores, the place is too small for its popularity. We were lucky to get a small table at the back thanks to the most helpful waitstaff, Charlotte. We ordered flat white and cappuccino plus cocotte and cubano sandwich. As indicated in the title, the coffee is tha star with the food taking second billing. No worries here as I consider Forty Hands a coffee bar that happens to serve food instead of the other way around. Service was quick, efficient and courteous. Mid range in terms of price point - around SG$55 for two.
5
This is our regular place for good cuppa and a good brunch. Sitting at this hipster neighbourhood with lots of new cafes. We've tried other cafès around here but still end up come back to this one. It's a little crowded on certain time so if u don't mind the wait. But generally small group like party for 2 is much easier to get a seat than a big group. (It's a small cosy cafe after all). Coffee - standard good cup of coffee like what u can get in Melbourne or other Aussie cafès. Food - I find it easier to find good coffee than good food in cafès in Singapore. But forty hands has the both, consistently. I like to standard egg Benedict with organic bacon and sweet and spicy roasted potatoes. Love those potatoes! Totally worth checking out if u like that kind of hipster Aussie style cafès that serves good coffee and food.
5
We went here for brunch on Sunday and it was pretty busy. Got a nice spot in the yard for two. We ordered eggs and cappuccino and both were good. It's not cheap, but service and atmosphere are worth it.
5
The food is always excellent here and the service is good. Great for breakfast/brunch/lunch. The 40 Hands Cubanos is my favorite!
4
Love the coffee and brunch. Their prices are on the higher side but I guess you gotta pay abit more for quality. Not really the best place to hang out on weekends coz it can get really crowded. So visiting on weekdays are the best!
4
Small place, very friendly, good service, nothing fancy, but really nice place with good food.
We had chicken panini and eggs Benedict with steak, fresh watermelon and apple juice, good coffee.
Very good, will go back.
4
Large choice of meal to brunch from salad to burger and Benedict eggs. Ingredients are fresh and portions are large. Little deception on the citrus cake as desert. Prices are fair too.
3
Tried this place out for a quick snack on a public holiday. Was VERY crowded, so I was looking forward to some good food and drinks. The seating was pretty confusing, there was a sign asking people to wait to be seated, but after standing for 10 minutes, I went to the counter to order. The cashier then asked me where I was sitting, and I stated that I hadn't been seated yet. She gestured to a door, and said I could sit downstairs if I wanted. I ordered the truffle mac & cheese, and a latte, and went to find the downstairs.The latte came quickly, and was hot. The mac & cheese was overwhelmed by the flavor of the truffle oil, and made it so greasy that it was almost inedible. The service was good, and the staff were friendly. The decor was funky chic, and had nice space. Wish that it was a bit more organized, and wouldn't order the M&C again. Looking at previous reviews, I probably should have tried something different for food. Still a nice place for a coffee though
4
We wanted try something else in Tiong Bahru and have then decided to try Forty hands. We had a nice salad and panini. Very fresh and enough to feel satisfied.I have to say that we have been welcomed by a genuine smile from the staff and service was very nice.Maybe just a little bit hard to find
3
This place is a bit over-hipped. The coffee is good, rather than great. Better than many, but not all, other places we tried. The food was decidedly average - waaaay too much truffle oil on the mac and cheese, with more on the fries. The mac and cheese was one of those two-mouthful meals you end up having sometimes. The second just to check the first was as bad as you thought. The sliders were good, but the pork fat to meat ratio was not. Overpriced for what it delivered. The cubanos were just ok, though we might not have finished them if the other dishes were better.If I'm in the area again I'll go back for (takeaway) coffee. If I'm hungry I'll go somewhere else
3
The food at Forty Hands is very tasty - I order the Eggs Cocotte myself. This tastiness may be partly due to the heavy use of truffle oil, which makes everything nice. The portions are rather small, it was a small plate with 2 poached eggs, mushrooms and very little spinach, and 2 pieces of toast. This for 18 SGD is quite expensive. Furthermore, the orange juice that I ordered for 8 SGD was tasty, but very very small, especially in a country like Singapore where you can get a freshly squeezed juice on every corner for about 1/4th of that price. Staff was friendly, but didn't follow up. We were seated at the window, with the first waiter saying she'd let us know when another space frees up, which was totally forgotten about after. Also, it seems like they should make it more clear to people whether and where they should wait for a table.Overall, the food and drinks were tasty, and the environment was nice. But it's a very small cafe and the portions are small
3
We arranged to meet friends here and found it to be a lovely little cafe. Our friends were nearly an hour late but the staff didn't mind us waiting for them without ordering anything and taking up a table. When we did order everything was good
5
We have just enjoyed the best breakfast we have had in Singapore in 10 months since living here. Great eggs Benedict and big boy breakfast. Coffees were really good and service excellent. Well done!!!!😊😊😊😊😊
4
Great place for breakfast/brunch. It is no-frills but cosy, with good food and good staff. Food presentation is good. We are from Melbourne so this reminded us of some of the rustic Melbourne cafes. Good all in all.
4
This bar/restaurant is located in the nice Tiong Bahru area. It is a bit small so tables are close to each other. We had a nice lunch, with some very nice salads. The staff was very friendly, so we had a good time here.
5
Visited on our honeymoon for a quick brunch before our flight to Thailand. The area is very trendy and the coffee shop fits right in. Excellent selection of brunch dishes on the menu. We had the banana French toast; perfect for a sweet tooth! Also the cheese toastie with ham and chips. Delicious. The iced mocha is very nice, with actual chunks of chocolate! Cool art work on the walls. A quirky place for a tasty brunch.
4
They are opened from 7.30 am. You have to go there early to get good seats. Their seats are limited. No service charge, no gst charge, no Wi-Fi.Ordered the following items - salmon hash SGD 20 - comes with fries, poached salmon in creamy sauce + toast + salad. The menu description states that it comes with mustard sauce but it does not comes with it. I have asked the staff there , they say I have to take the sauce at the side by myself. - hot chocolate. SGD 6 - if you want to take pictures, take it soon when the hot chocolate is served. If you leave it for a while, the latte art will get distorted. All in all, quite satisfying meal.
4
With a rather limited menu, this establishment surprised me with the quality of the food and the manner in which it was presented to clients (albeit the long wait for food). Good coffee and love the freshly squeezed juice options. A rather noisy and rather crowded place which goes to show how popular and good the place is. Much better than most other places in the area for sure. Do git it a try but be prepared to wait for a table and receive your food
3
We had been meaning to go to this place for ages but could never make it happen thanks to the consistently long lines and wait times. We finally manged to go with the 3 of us and a friend. The space inside is a bit cramped but still had a nice if rather noisy vibe. They also have a setup where you yourself go to the register, order and pay and then someone serves you. Its a bit of a chaotic setup for a place this busy although I imagine its to help out their wait staff. For such a popular brunch place, the menu for food is surprisingly limited. My son had chicken sausage (which was good), my wife a pesto chicken wrap (also good), and then my friend had a so-so smoked salmon hash and I had a very forgettable and dry falafel sandwich. For drinks I had the passion fruit tea and the chunky slices of toast were delicious. We weren't in the mood for desert though the choices seemed nice if completely standard. I'm not a coffee drinker so maybe that would have made it a difference, and judging by the crowds definitely has its place as the neighborhood coffee place. But from a meal perspective I wouldn't rush back there anytime soon as there was nothing memorable or noteworthy that justified the ongoing lines of people. Plain Vanilla just across the street is far better on the desert front and with an extremely limited savory selection of 5 sandwiches somehow is a lot better on that front as well
4
We enjoyed the coffee quality, taste and its ambiance.We liked the interior and setting. The aura and aroma are just right.The place does not feel too touristy. This is more like a local joint, especially since the location is not around tourist area.You have to put some steps from Tiong Bahru station among the residential area uncommon to tourists
4
I believe Forty Hands also provide coffee beans to Tiong Bahru Bakery. The coffee at Tiong Bahru Bakery is usually nice, so the coffee at Forty Hands is supposed to be nice too. But the day I visited, the coffee was just ok (I ordered iced latte but the ice was not enough and when I added more ice cubes, it was not so nice), the food was quite nice.They were slightly expensive (which is normal in Singapore). The place is quite tiny. Do expect that you will be sitting very close to a stranger when you visit during the weekends
5
I am astounded that in all the years I lived in Singapore I never knew about this place. It really is up there with the best of coffee shops / cafes anywhere. It is busy and crowded and noisy and that is perfect. The coffee was excellent, quick, hot and exactly what I asked for. The food, all day breakfast, really innovative. A deconstructed eggs benedict for my colleague looked great and I told it was better to eat. My French Toast with banana and added extras was one of the best breakfasts I have had, and it was lunch time. I was sorry to have already had breakfast as I would have liked to try another course. I will be back here next visit without doubt....
4
Cool vibe to the place and literally cool air-con, which is great! Coffee was pretty fab too. Food looked pretty pricey and nothing special, so ditched in favour of Tiong Bahru Bakery.
4
This is the best place for breakfast or brunch in Tiong Bahru area. It is small, but cozy. Popular among young couples and people leaving around. Great food.
5
What a great place! A groovy cafe with great food and atmosphere. Would recommend to any Aussie travels or anyone els looking for a hot breakfast spot.
5
Went there with a friend for breakfast, the place is cozy and intimate, food quality eas excellent , service was quick
4
Been here before about a year ago and still very good. The seating inaide is tight and using very small tables and stools and it can get busy.Sandwiches and salads are excellent. Try the Cubanos if you enjoy pork. Coffee is from coffeeman roasters (and much better value here than their own place).Recomended. Possibly trendy and hip (but they still let me in so it can't be that special :-)

I was excited after reading all of these reviews saying it was an Aussie café and very similar to a trendy Melbourne café and I was also excited finding out it was across the road from the apartment we rented.It wasn't a bad café by any means, it was just amped up to be a lot better than it was. It was a good, solid café that I can see how people easily love this place but I couldn't 'love' it. Everything was definitely good. Good coffee, good cakes, nice little café but there is a much better one across the road.Don't get me wrong, I would revisit but I just didn't think it was super special

I thoroughly enjoyed the food here. We arrived around 930 Saturday morning and it was fairly busy, but by 1030 they were almost packed. There is additional seating out the back as well, non air con.We got the "big boy breakfast" and the "eggs collete". The eggs were amazing, would highly recommend (especially if you like mushrooms) and I found the big breakfast really really good. However the mushrooms on that one were a bit too salty and the bread it came with was underwhelming.The coffee here was beautiful. No other word

Wife and I visited Forty Hands fort he first time for a lazy breakfast.The location is ideally located within the hip Tiong Bahru area, but is tucked back a little bit...it wasn't super obvious that one was passing by a cafe.The cafe is long and narrow...parent with buggies will find navigating difficult. Interior is "hip vintage" with darkish tones throughout.The coffee was excellent, with good bitterness and earthy notes. Wife thought it was too strong, but for me their Flat White was as it should be (often Singaporean cafes add way too much milk).Food was nice, but breakfast menu was a little limited. I had Eggs Benedict with spicy potatoes. Both were excellent. Wife had French toast with bacon and caramelised banana...it was very tasty.In conclusion, Forty Hands is a solid cafe with a decent, if a little limited, food menu. The cafe itself isn't really kid friendly, so bear this in mind if you try to go on the weekend

This cafe is one of the many trendy places that popped up not too long ago to cater to the cafe-hopping crowd. I visited the cafe this week with a friend for brunch to find out for myself what this cafe-hopping thing is all about.I had a soya latte and a falafel pita. The coffee was delicious and reasonably priced.The food on the other hand was average. The falafel and nice and crunchy although there were only four falafel in the pita. Chips were a little soggy, pale and greasy. The pita was dressed with a watery dressing (which didn't taste like tahini, more like a watered down yoghurt sauce). I think it wouldn't hurt to add more falafel to the pita as they cost very little to make.The ambience is not particularly memorable: lots of graffiti on the walls, very little space to move about. Got a very hipster feel to it. If you are a late riser, you may have to sit in the area in the back which is very hot (not air-conditioned). The bill came up to about $50 for the two of us... which I found to be quite expensive for something that isn't very complicated or expensive to make.Maybe it's just me but this place is not my cup of tea. Or maybe I'm just a cheapskate.If anyone invites to Forty Hands again, I'll get a coffee to go and sip it on my balcony. :

... and the best coffee ever. Expect it to be busy and quite crowded but good fun and friendly. Great sandwiches! Yong Siak road seem to be an up and coming artsy place that is interesting to stroll around. Easy to reach by buss or MRT at Tiong Bahru

One of our nearby places to visit for good coffee and bites. Come early, it gets busy. The secret is out. The cool brigade know all about this not so secret joint.

Dined here today with my family for brunch after reading rave reviews about this place. Upon entering the cafe, I figured it's a hipster hangout place and definitely not child-friendly. My assumption was spot on as they don't have child seats. The place was super packed and the aisle very narrow and you can't walk through it without rubbing against the person who is passing through or dining. Each table has a set of paper menu with food list on one side and drinks on the other. You have to place your order at the counter and they will serve your food at your table and mind you, there is no service charge.We ordered egg cocotte, 40 hands falafel, cappuccino and a cup of hot chocolate. The food was served shortly. The egg cocotte came with two poached eggs sauteed spinach, Portobello mushrooms and two sourdough toasts by the side. The 40 falafel came with two pita bread slathered with hummus and stuffed with falafels, drizzled with cucumber and tomato raita. The falafels tasted good and were very close to the authentic version. Just that they tasted a little soggy. The coffee tasted excellent as it is from common man roasters and the hot chocolate was great too. Overall, the food was good but the ambience was not pleasant. Good for a quick munch but not for hanging out with your buddies.

Coffee addict had been suffering some withdrawals since arriving in Singapore and have tried a few highly rated places early on. Been here for five weeks and found the time to get to 40 hands today and absolutely loved it. Ordered my coffee of choice - a piccolo latte- and it was utterly delicious! Can't wait to make it my weekend regular and try the food there
3
Perhaps I'm getting old and grumpy, but I'd like my trendy served up with a little less noise. Forty hands has the reputation of having resurrected Tiong Bahru from a sleepy heritage area into a trendy place to be. I'm not a coffee lover, so I guess that part was lost on me. Their food was pretty decent, and we particularly liked their sliders. But it's a small space with a lot of concrete and high ceilings and as a result it was practically impossible to hear any conversation except that of your neighbours.
5
I love the egg benedicts and steak - largely because it is the potatoes which accompanies this which makes the dish a truly unique and differentiated. Diced potatoes sauteed in spicy sauce - you'll be back for more! The only issue is the very limited seating capacity, so go off-peak to be safe
4
Interesting since last visit approx 2 years ago a hip coffee culture has started to develop...the coffee is NOT cheap and there is much to learn when compared to Sydney -Melbourne (such as GLASSES for lattes )...but it is on its way.Good food was had here and the area is good for a walk for interesting bookshops etc...also interesting deco apartments that I suspect are now very expensive... the gentrification process has begun !
4
It's a nice place to come for brunch or light coffee breaks during mid-day. There are good amount of menus for you to choose. Coffee is good, but not great though. I ordered truffle mushroom toasties which tastes okay, but the toasts are a bit chewy. Pesto Chicken sandwiches are good
5
Had the privilege of dining here for a delicious Sunday morning breakfast. Lovely walk past the hospital from the city. Would recommend to anyone. My wife and I had iced lattes and were delighted that the sugar syrup came on the side so we could add or omit to taste. We also had the poached eggs with mushroom and the salmon hash. Both were amazing but the salmon hash was the hero. Prices are about the same as Aus
5
After a wonderful New Years Eve took the short taxi ride to the Tiong Bahru Area to try and find this tiny coffee house after a recommendation from a friend. Blink and you could walk past it but on entering you are met with the hustle and bustle you would expect to find when you put a serving bar, tables and 30 odd people into a space no larger than a couple of front rooms. After a short wait,a place on a shared bench became available. The Big boy breakfast, carrot and orange juice and a couple of wonderful cappuccinos were ordered. Everything arrived swiftly and an array of flavours from such a simple dish ensued. Free range eggs, organic pork and tomatoes and a semi sour dough for toast were devoured to aid the recovery of the previous nights festivities. Very modern, very trendy, very efficient but most importantly beautiful simple food served in an enhancing atmosphere. Worth the trip out and the area boasts some great book shops and various art inspired boutique shops.
4
Most of you had probably already heard of this place as it's quite hip and trendy. The place was packed around lunch time on Saturday but still we found a table after some people left. We had a big boy's breakfast (really amazing dish), some eggs and a 40 hand cubanos sandwich. All were great. Then dessert with some coffees. The cakes were fantastic. Would reallly recommend this place but for one thing. When I was ordering, I was leaning against the counter and my pants were dirty because of that. After washing twice, the stains were still there, so watch out when you order at the counter!
5
Tasty food, amazing coffee art and a very hip place. I haven't seen a better latte swan.
Worth checking out the cool shops nearby as well.
5
Always a must visit for coffee and steamed buns whenever I'm in Singapore ☕️. The place is small though, just squeeze youself in 😊
4
Got to love this joint that started to bring some vibrancy into Tiong Bahru. Come for some beautiful coffee & beautiful food. A charming spot to sit outside & people watch. Come have a piece of odeh-odeh cake!!
4
This cafe serves very nice coffee. The place is pretty small so it's always crowded. If you're in the area, you mist visit and try their coffee.
5
The Forty Hands Cafe was higher recommend by our friend, so we decided to check.
It is a little far from touristic sights but near from MTR Station.
We had a very good brunch there.
5
This little joint probably started this whole postmodern development in Tiong Bahru. The western comfort food served in the retro setting of an old (shop)house has hipster spelt all over. They serve a mighty coffee and the latte (even with skimmed milk) is to die for. The food is pretty decent but maybe just a 4 out of 5. I love their egg Benedict with juicy steaks but I wish they put more effort in the hollandaise sauce. It's pretty hard to get a table at peak hours so go early or after the lunch crowd. Some will rightfully point out that the place is on the pricy side but you can't get that quality of coffee and quality service anywhere here for cheaper
5
OK, let's be frank, Tiong Bahru is hipster central in Singapore and 40 Hands is probably hipster HQ. I had a pretty good caesar salad that made an excellent brunch, and the cakes looked good - I only tried the red bean pau and they were good (albeit good pau can be found all over Sg).Nope - what made this place stand out is the coffee. I had lattes on a couple of occasions. I'm simply struggling to think of a cup of coffee that I've enjoyed more. I suspect that I won't manage - this is probably the best coffee I've ever had

Forty Hands, being tucked away in the once quiet Yong Siak Street, is kind of difficult to find with lots of lanes and streets in the neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru. The nearest MRT station is Tiong Bahru station where you should disembark the train there and you have to walk about 10-15 minutes to the residential area.The Eggs Benedict was tasty and well cooked. The eggs were beautifully poached, just like those at Common Man Coffee Roasters, and the spicy potatoes cooked with sun-dried tomatoes were so addictively good, they deserve a solo spot in the menu.The breakfast menu that never fails me every time I come here is Kong Bak Pau. The seasoned pork was simply succulent. The steamed buns were light, fluffy and smooth in texture.For a touch of local flavour, I had Chendol Cupcake. It was a dense cupcake that has a strong chendol fragrance to it. Itâ€™s a very interesting take on cupcake by incorporating the elements of chendol into it. Creative yet still delicious.The Mocha was very good, richly fragrant and well balanced in terms of sweetness. My friend had the Piccolo Latte which he claimed was very strong with a tad of a sour finish. I can see this type of coffee being loved by some, and disliked by others. It really depends on what kind of coffee you fancy. But most agreed with me that the coffee here had a beautiful roast, depth of flavour, and nicely done latteFive years now, Forty Hands does certainly seem to have retained its glorious spot as one of the best cafes around. Great job, Forty Hands!Feel free to read my thorough review as sassy eater at UrbanOutEaters.

Great all round cafe ... Vibe, Coffee & Food.Funky small cafe spot with variety of layouts ... small tables, benches, outside, plus courtyard with industrial feel.Good coffee, with slightly bitter short macch's. Food menu not massive, but has variety & creativity. We choose the eggs cocotte (with brilliant mushrooms; & toast was a pleasant surprise) & big boy breakfast (so many flavours). A lot to like, so we'll be back soon
3
The food (poached eggs and banana pancakes) were fine, but nothing outstanding - you could have that at any diner. However, the price tag was pretty steep: $18 per dish. And the coffee isn't exactly cheap either... And a bit of a hike if you come by public transport: you disembark at MRT station Tiang Bahru, and you have about a 15 minute hike in the heat ahead of you, along a construction site, down a residential area street, until you finally hit the stretch of area with a few nice restaurants.
5
I love their Eggs Ben and their Flat white 👌🏼Will visit soon! 💯 and yeah the staffs are accommodating and good service. 👍🏼
3
Nice food and coffee. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was very crowded, and we could only get a seat outside.
I recommend the Cubano sandwich.
4
After researching the best brunch spots in Singapore, my partner and I decided to give Forty Hands a try. The staff were friendly and efficient and our order was processed quickly. My partner had eggs benedict and I had poached eggs with mushrooms - both were tasty and well cooked. We also shared some signature spicy potatoes which were amazing! All up we paid about $60 SGD which I personally think is a lot for breakfast dishes, especially eggs. Nonetheless we enjoyed our food and would dine here again.
5
Friendly, smiley & welcoming genuine baristas. Tried the ice coffee which was served in a glass (not plastic, yay!) - made with chilled milk, chilled coffee which was packed with flavour, ice cubes galore & when brought to my table I was even offered sugar syrup with it! The coffee is strong & lacks that bitterness so apparent in those big abhorrent chains, so smooth & easy to taste the flavour of the bean - just perfect!Only downside; although homemade & three cakes to choose from in the window - they didn't have chocolate! I guess you can't have everything huh.. Shows they really do focus on their coffee ,
5
Perfect flat white coffee, served in small venue down a little side street. And a healthy food option of Eggs Cocotte (I abstained from the trendy truffle oil). And a flash of freshly made watermelon/apple juice. Friendly immediate service. A slight bit pricy but I didn't mind. This made an enjoyable Sunday morning. Can be busy so I opted to sit at the counter outside
5
Great breakfast and coffee. 8am to 4pm brunch. Awesome atmosphere a little more rushed feeling than other places in Singapore but they are busy.Only complaint was the stools felt a little low for the bars tables to eat. And im not a shorty..lol . recommended.
5
Stopped in for a late lunch/brunch following an expat friend's recommendation. We were not disappointed, the egg dishes were outstanding and the cuban sandwich was the best I have had for a long time. You want to get here before 4 if you want a good choice as brunch stops at 
5
We are really spoiled with so many great cups of coffee in Singapore and fun cafes to visit. However, the coffee at Forty Hands always tastes the best! The Barista takes his time with each individual cup of coffee and you can really taste the difference. The menu also has lots of fun bites if you want to combine your coffee with a meal. The orange blossom cake is also delicious
3
We have been there for brunch on a busy Sunday and the place was full inside and outside. Luckily, a table for two just opened up inside when we arrived. Unfortunately, it felt very cramped and they might have put just one table too many in the anyway small café. The other guests even had to slide their table over so my wife (slim) could reach the seat on the back side.The salmon hash with its creamy sauce was very tasty but unfortunately the 40 Hands Cubanos sandwich had too much mustard overpowering the juicy pork
4
An all day breakfast with a twist.Took the missus for a nice coffee and brekkie and since we were heading towards Tiong Bahru, this is only a hop away.At 11.30am they were almost full with a mix of young and executive crowds mingling in this little place.They served great coffee and the breakfast fare was visually attractive. We had the:• Cappuccino $5.50 - nice aromatic & rich.• Lemon Ginger Mint Tea $5.50 - refreshing and light.• 2 Asian Sliders $7.50 - slices of thick cut kong ba with hot pau & lettuce. Meat is moist yet skin tender. Traditional flavor done well.• Muscle Mary Salad $14 - seems like a popular salad as we saw a few diners having it. It is unique, tangy and sweet, something fresh just nice with the sliders and fries.• Truffle Fries $9 - seems everyone is serving this now. Their version is generous with the truffle oil and done like McD's, crispy. Would've preferred some truffle flakes but at $9, it's still ok.Note: Don't order more than a plate and drink each. The tables are small likewise the seats and elbow room are claustrophobic. Else go off-peak.Food: 9/10Drinks: 8/10Location: 7/10Parking: 5/10Ambience/ 8/10Overall: 8/10Will return to have a toastie
4
Great little rustic cafe tucked away in the middle of nowhere..friendly service and great Sunday Brunch, cake and coffee.
3
It was not too big but enough to grab a short brunch with friends. But the space was not too spacious though, you can take a seat on their outdoor seating area, but there are some people smoke there, so it was quite disturbing.
4
Eggs benedict are good, portion is big and prices reasonable for Singapore. It's a tiny place so grab a table if you see one. No one is taking your order, you will need to go by the bar for that. Service is quick.
4
Great upgrade to the menu and the decor. Food is super as usual. But the rear side covered lower level seating has a strong smell.
5
Easily the best Eggs Benedict I have had anywhere in the world. Found this place on Trip Advisor, it needs to be rated way higher than it is. You'd never know it was there (but it's often packed with locals). Great coffee, great food. If you're close, don't miss it
3
I visited 40 hands after reading about it in burrple just to give it a try. It turns out the place can be hard to find and may be a bit of a walk from TB mrt or the nearest bus stop. It may also be crowded during weekends. Brunch choices were good. I ordered their famous eggs benedict. Taste wasn't bad. Coffee was average and smaller than usual cafe size. Prices might be steep if not by Singapore standards. I might be back for the big boy breakfast.
3
Went to Forty Hands on a friend's recommendation. Arrived slightly after lunch hour and seats for 2 pax were readily available. The cafe is pretty small and cosy.Ordered truffle mushroom sandwich, latte and flat white. Sandwich portion is generous and delicious except I personally prefer it with less rocket. Coffee was slightly sour and hence disappointing. Definitely had better coffee at other cafes.Would return to try their food again
4
No matter what you will always have a great meal here. Food is generous and always tastes great! It does get busy however tables turn over fairly quickly. My only question mark is over the coffee here, it always tastes a little acidic. Down the road at tiong bahru bakery uses the same coffee and it's so much better. Still definitely worth visiting 40 hands.
3
When I think of Singapore. .I think of a place that I would really enjoy the coffee. The coffee at Forty hands is really lovely. I see a good selection of sandwiches and breakfast food. The service is unhurried. ..And the place is bursting with hungry people. Definitely worth a visit if you are in.the area!
3
Wanted to go to the tiong bahru bakery , after finding a big queue there, we started walking around the place and landed in this place ...what attracted us was that on the street full of options for eateries this one was buzzing ....we just went in.Food was really good...and coffee was amazing...but coffee In This area is great in about all of the restaurants...there are a lot of regulars here . But this area I believe is full of great places to go to, I don't say I won't come here but I believe I would like to give others a try before going back
5
It took a taxi ride but it was worth it. Superb coffee - beautiful roast, crema and depth of flavor. And positioned amidst some great book shops, galleries etc as part of a lovely low rise historic precinct that is well worth walking around in.
5
Trendy place, excellent for breakfast, brunch or lunch. The staff is really friendly and accommodating, you will love their coffee, it is "just right".
There is a lot more on the menu and my orange juice just tasted so nice!
4
This small and cozy cafe is serving good foods and beverages.
They have artistic mural right behind the back doors, and it can be a little bit crowded around brunch time, but we love it.
5
Great Aussie breakfast fresh and hardy good cuppa coffee, great layout, chilled atmosphere, will be back again when in singapore next, only downside service not so friendly but the food says it all
4
I don't know where this coffee comes from and how it is made but it was undoubtedly one of the best shot of espresso i ever had and the best of all in Asia. We didn't try any food but the coffee in itself is worth the trip. Service is friendly and the neighborhood is also nice. A bit expensive for the neighborhood and 4SGD for an espresso is outrageous for european guys but it is the price in sgp
4
A great little cafe. Menu has great options for vegetarians as well as those wanting a light breakfast/lunch. Mainly western options. Coffee is by Common Man Coffee Roasters. Service is friendly. The surrounding area is filled with local boutique shops, bookstores, gift stores etc so worth the wander around. Tiong Bahru market nearby. It is located between Tiong Bahru and Outram Park MRT
4
I stumbled across this cafe whilst exploring the local area so when I went in I wasn't aware of it's popularity, ratings or even it's existence! Brunch menu is served until 4pm. Lovely eggs which they happily adapted to be be dairy and gluten free. Good local coffee too
3
Some friends invited me to go check Tiong bahru area as it's been buzzing around as a great place for brunches and chilled Sundays. To be honest, it takes more than a cool bicycle at the door and decent coffee to make a place stand a part. Forty Hans is a decent place, the food is ok and the atmosphere is good but it's nothing extraordinaire. If you go there, don't get stuck on the "Big boy Breakfast" because I'm still trying to understand why they put that Bolognese sauce and a very poor sausage quality. Go for the Eggs Benedict :-), trust me. Iced coffees are a bit expensive and the place is usually too crowed, which I don't understand. Something they should improve is the ordering experience. Why should I join the same cue than "Take away" orders when I'm sitting there and I want to spend my times talking with my friends in the table?Being realistic, the place is nice but it doesn't offer any "out of extraordinary" to book your Sundays there. Go check it out, not bad but still average..
4
Mosaic tiled walls greeted us and though it was a tight space, ¾ was filled at 2pm on a weekday, spotting expats and rich locals. Unlike what I envision a perfect lazy afternoon to be like where I could sit for hours on end, the constant stream of people made me do otherwise. 2nd time coming to this joint, 1st time I sat at the back (non-air conditioned) in the evening and it was fine by me as it provided a very relaxing, hipster ambiance. Went with an empty stomach so us 2 girls could finish a salmon hash and big boy breakfast respectively. I’d recommend the salmon hash! It’s a pretty unique dish. The Ice chocolate wasn’t fantastic and overall the food is too pricey for my liking. Isn’t one that I’ll regularly patron as I ain’t a coffee-lover and unfortunately have zero appreciation to this specialty coffee joint bringing third wave coffee to our little red dot. TIP: Use the toilet to try their handmade soap
4
Very tight place serving good food and maintained pretty well. The servers as in many such places in Sgp are kids around 18-20 yrs old, thus are quiet dynamic. Coffee was decent and other drinks offered were good too. Overall pricing is a touch above avg for a small cafe. On Seating- I would recommend anyone visiting here to sit at the front side as the back, though has more seating and is cosier is really warm as it neighbours the kitchen. Would visit Forty Hands for more good times. Keep up the good work.
4
Good coffee and good atmosphere for a small group of 6 people gathering! Good for Sunday brunch.....
4
I would recommend this cafe to couples, since it is definitely very small and quite packed for lunchtime on a week-end. The food and coffee were alright, but nothing to swoon over. One orders at the counter.
4
A small little cafe nested at a corner lot in the tiong bahru area.Always crowded and pack no matter what time of the day you head there.Food there is great although a little on the pricey side but the localize flavored cup cakes are a different twist to desserts.Coffee is great and they serve common man roasters beans for caffein fix but the seating area at back are hot perhaps due to kitchen and vents so apart of limited seating its a great place to chill out if you get a good seat
4
Came here for coffee and a pastry after having lunch at PS Cafe Petit in a nearby street. The cappucino was great with a lot of attention to detail with the design on the cream. The pastry was ok, perhaps a little sweet for my liking. Service was a little abrupt, but that's perhaps because we weren't quite cool enough, dressed in business attire on a Tuesday lunchtime. Ordering at the counter was a little awkward given the limited space - not much room for people to get past. The place was pretty busy at about 1pm on a weekday given the location in a residential area
5
Small 'hole in the wall' cafe in the Tiong Bahru Estate, not far from China town. We love this cafe. It has great coffee and fresh juices as well as excellent light food. You MUST try the Pork steamed bun consisting of seasoned port and the steam bun served separately. Also, a delicious Baby spinach, bacon, macadamia and feta salad
3
Went for a casual lunch meeting at fortyH4nds earlier.Entering through the back door which was accessible via the open air carpark, the cosy "outdoor" seating looked like a former courtyard. The area could probably fit about 15pax. While I liked the area because it looked potentially photogenic, the smell of food cooking was heavy despite the industrial fans placed to circulate the air. Hence, we sat indoors.The interior was bustling with the lunch crowd. We arrived at about 12:40pm before more people arrived. There was just the right amount of lighting to create a warm glow. The interior design was tastefully decorated with food-themed posters & military-themed inscriptions were found on the wooden cupboards. Food was to be ordered at the counter. I ordered the Big Bang with pork sausage while my friend took the Truffle mushroom sandwich. We wanted to have the kong bak bao but it wasn't available. The serving size was ok. Might be insufficient for a bigger eater or someone really hungry. The Big Bang took me 6 normal bites to finish up. No, I did not eat it daintily like a girl should. Fork & knife aside, I ate the bun like it should be eaten - with my hands. It was good but definitely not wow. I initially thought the sandwich was arugula only but finally saw the truffle mushroom peaking through the salad. A big issue for me was the poor indoor ventilation. I left smelling greasy & I could only disguise the smell with really strong perfume.Lunch was decent & coffee was good, I even took back a cuppa along with 2 tarts. The Snicker one was a tad bit sweet. Probably best eaten before coffee. The dark chocolate tart was a hit. However, I do not have an desire to go back anytime soon
5
Had brunch here today - great spot, and this could become a firm favourite. My wife loved her eggs benedict (watch out for the spicy potatoes on the side) and my Jamaican pork sandwich was almost perfect - right down to the old skool greased proof paper wrapping. Excellent coffees, drinks of juice in classic hipster jam jars, iced water in medicine bottles - great stuff.Plenty of seating, indoor and out - plus a healthy trade in take-away coffees, and a tempting array of cakes.This place is a keeper - very well worth a visit, and there is a fantastic book shop right across the street. I can see myself being in here most weekends
5
I loved this quaint little cafe. It's in the back streets but worth seeking out. Great atmosphere, awesome food (the french toast was to die for!) and the coffee was of a high standard. It does get busy so be prepared, as the overflow seating down the back isn't air conditioned so if it is warm (when isn't it in Singapore!) be prepared. Can't speak highly enough of this place
4
Reason we went to Tiong Bahru was to enjoy the quaint atmosphere of the place. We chose to eat at Forty Hands as the place was cozy. Finding a place to sit was challenging although the waiters were attentive to help. I had their gourmet dogs and truffle fries. Loved the fries
4
I'll start off this review with a rave about their COFFEEEEEE, I had the flat white and it was great. Right temperature, right flavors, not too acidic - it was a great cup. I had Eggs Cocotte for brunch and I thought that it was good. Good but not great but enjoyable enough. The only thing I don't quite like about the place is that it is SO CROWDED (11am on a Sunday, peak brunch time) and can be warm, not enough air-conditioning. The location is also difficult to get to also, esp for non Singapore residents. A taxi is a must. But the area is nice, a very hipster neighborhood. The coffee shop sits side by side with cute little bookstores, bakeries and quaint places that sell unique items. Will I return? very high probability, despite logistics difficulty
4
One of the famous cafe in tiong bahru area. Great food great coffee but beware it's really small place so you will need to queue if it's during brunch/ lunch time in weekend. One suggestion to the mgmt will be : strong aircon pls!
5
A great little Cafe in Tiong Bahru. Only tried the pork buns but a fantastic choice as they were delicious. The buns were yummy and the pork was moist and tender. A really good atmosphere and well worth the visit.
5
Had a craving for eggs Benedict and this is one of the recommended places. Didn't disappointed. Will be back to try Egg Cocotte.
3
like most reviews have said, the coffee here is indeed not too bad. but skip the iced/hot chocolate, the quality's not there.the red bean pau (chinese steamed bun with red bean paste) was served piping hot, but so are those sold at normal dim sum shops for 60 cents each. this one was $2.50. the only difference is that the pau here is flatter.brunch items were just alright, too many places serving the same stuff for forty hands to stand out.still, if you're going to visit, spend some time strolling the neighbourhood. great old architecture and interesting shops around
5
Great coffee and service! I had the french toast with bananas, maple syrup and crispy bacon with fresh watermelon and apple juice and it was just divine! Mocha was perfect and the milk wasn't burnt which is what we found with a lot of other coffee places in the area.I highly recommend having a feed here
2
It's not unreasonable to be asking for a baby chair in a cafe, especially when other similar cafes (Dispensary) in the area have them. Imagine my wife's and my surprise when we were told by a sullen and rude Malay service staff today that the restaurant doesn't have one, and that customers "normally" sit their babies with them on the cushioned benches (with their heads propped against the hard wall). Absolutely ridiculous and poor service, especially from this staff. The mushrooms in the eggs croqette were too salty, and the dish was overpriced. Will never visit again.If you have a baby, do not go! This is what 40 Hands is telling its customers through it's absolutely rificulous policy
5
I was recommended to check this place out for brunch and it didn't disappoint, i went for Sunday brunch at about 1pm and it was very busy, with almost every table taken. There is indoor and outdoor seating, the latter being in a covered courtyard out back. The tables are a little jammed in but does serve to create a nice buzz in the place. The food was really great, service was good it's a kind of self service at the counter type deal, i had the big breakfast and couldn't fault it, was really delicious, will definitely be back to try some more off the menu some time soon

On a friend’s recommendation my wife and I recently paid a visit to Forty Hands Café in Tiong Bahru, Singapore. Though the café on Yong Siak St. is a bit out of the way, the 10 min stroll from Tiong Bahru MRT is well worth the effort.We visited on a Sunday morning and the place was packed, mainly with young locals enjoying a Sunday morning brunch.Forty Hands owner is a young man from Perth who has recently opened another café (Man in Common) in the more conveniently located Robertson Quay.Forty Hand’s main claim to fame is its coffee, which is excellent. The menu is also very good (mainly Aussie/European) and not expensive. A surprise bonus, much appreciated in Singapore’s tropical heat, was the stock of Fremantle’s Little Creatures beer.John Harriso

What a find!! Tucked away in a back street of Tiong Bahru. The only way the coffee could be better is in a bigger mug!! The food others were eating looked amazing too. Only got the chance to sample a chocolate tart - worth every calorie. Venue very small & extremely busy at lunchtime - suggest you go early or late!! Stay at the Nostalgia Hotel & get the best bed ever - walk here for coffee & hit Tiong Bahru market for dinner - love this are

Forty Hands really lived up to the expectation of having the best coffee in Singapore. I had their cappuccino- it was beautifully served, the coffee was wonderful and the level of sweetness is perfect. I also had their Chicken Ceasar salad- a little pricey, but it was absolutely delicious. The portion was huge too
4
Tiny place, short menu, great coffee.
This was our third time here. This time I had the poached eggs with spinach and mushrooms and truffle oil. Served in a bowl with lightly toasted bread for dipping.
We'll be back.

A very nice little café in Tiong Bahru. Excellent brunch menu - until 4pm. I recommend the Eggs Cocotte! We also enjoyed tge coffee there.
5
Adorable little cafe - makes me wistful for Melbourne coffee culture.
Yummy cakes and I cross the island on a bus for the coffee.
5
Forty Hands is small, but has great coffee, pastries and snacks. Located on a quiet street, the service here was quick and very friendly. We loved it.

Over a month ago I came by for breakfast and also picked up some coffee beans after a recommendation from one of your baristas. Those beans were not the kind I had asked for, and I tried to write to you with my feedback via the email listed on your website. The email bounced back saying the account is not active. I then sent you the message privately on your FB account, to no response. A week later I tried again, with no response again.You leave me no choice but to give you a negative review publicly. I tried to reach out, but you seem to have no interest in listening to your customers

Not too milky, not too hot, not bitter, not weak. Just right. If Little Red Riding Hood was Searching for coffee that day in the woods not porriage she would have been pleased with Forty H4nds.Great lattes & their magic macchiato is a well balanced mix of coffee & milky foamy goodness

This rather well-known café is found along Yiong Siak Street, in the heart of Tiong Bahru Estate. Forty Hands is within walking distance from Tiong Bahru Plaza, where the MRT Station is. However, those who prefer avoiding the sweltering heat may choose to take bus service 121 from the bus stop at Tiong Bahru Plaza (Code: 10169), and alight at the next stop. The stop you’ll be alighting is called “Blk 126 CP” (Code: 10121), which is located along Kim Tian Road. Just for your information, CP simply refers to the multi-storey carpark located behind the bus-stop. From the bus-stop, backtrack a bit and you’ll see a T-junction, at which you should make a right turn. Continue walking straight till you encounter a curved T-junction. Look out for the green-coloured sign that indicates Moh Guan Terrace. At that junction, make a right turn to enter Yong Siak Street. As you enter Yong Siak Street, look out for place-markers like “Yong Siak View” and “Yong Siak Court”; Forty Hands café is located opposite Yong Siak Court.The café serves staple brunch items like Eggs Benedict, several kinds of sandwiches, as well as some local items like Tau Sa Pau (steamed red bean buns) and Kong Bak Pau (Chinese braised pork sandwiched in steamed buns). So far, the items I had were the Eggs Benedict with bacon and roast potatoes (S$16), the Eggs Cocotte (S$16), and the Brioche French Toast (S$15). Of the three, I really enjoyed the Eggs Benedict the most, thanks to the spiced roast potatoes, which taste so good that it could be featured as a dish on its own! I also understand that poached eggs require a bit of technique to get it right, so I really appreciated that the ones served on my Eggs Benedict were firm on the outside and runny on the inside. The Eggs Cocotte also features perfectly-done poached eggs laid atop a mix of mushrooms and veggies, served alongside some toast. I have no complains whatsoever about their Eggs Cocotte, though whenever I pit it against the Eggs Benedict, the former just seems to fall short somehow, which is kinda unfortunate… I’m guessing the Brioche French Toast will be quite a hit with the younger ones, seeing as how they top their fluffy toast with a scoop of vanilla ice cream (yes kids, ice cream for breakfast is allowed here! =P)Forty Hands also serves a selection of cakes and desserts if you aren’t really looking for a full-on kind of brunch; though even with one I somehow managed to try their Key Lime Pie (~S$7), their Lemon Curd Cheesecake (~S$7), as well as their Mango, Passion fruit and Coconut Cake (S$8). I felt that the Lemon Curd Cheesecake was a brilliant creation because the lemon curd added that refreshing, citrusy touch to a normally dense dessert. Though if you’re looking for something slightly more acidic, I would suggest going for the Key Lime Pie. The Mango, Passion fruit and Coconut Cake is no doubt the most expensive slice of cake I’ve ever bought! While the flavours blend quite nicely, I’m sad to say it lacks that WOW factor befitting of its price tag. Lastly of course, what are cakes without coffee? I’m no experienced coffee-drinker, but I simply couldn’t resist ordering a latte for myself after reading about how good the coffee here at Forty Hands is. You can definitely tell that the staff here are dead serious about getting their coffee concoctions right; in their free time in between customers, I noticed the staff doing taste tests of their own coffee, or even practising their latte art! Full marks for effort indeed!All in all, my visits to Forty Hands have so far been immensely enjoyable with all the good food and coffee. It’s definitely worth a stop if you’re in the Tiong Bahru area

This is my second time to the Cafe, the first time was about six months back when I only had a coffee then. Decided to try out their brunch this time round, with a few friends. The place is packed as usual. We had Egg Benedict, Egg Cocoette and Truffle Mushroom Toasties, everyone was happy with their food. We had latte and cappuccino for our drinks. All I could say is that I remembered my cappuccino was better the previous time, but I could not exactly point out why. But overall, it was a satisfying brunch, although the prices is on the higher end. We paid about S$60 for 3 coffees and the food, the portion of the food was not exactly that large
5
The day I visited Forty Hands was a rainy morning. I ordered a cup of hot chocolate and a slice of Lemon Curd Cheesecake. The hot choco was great to warm my body in the cold morning and the delicious cheesecake even make my stop-by greater. Not bad to visit there even there was quite a distance from Tiong Bahru MRT station to Forty Hands

I found out about 40 hands in my rough guides travel book, I dont think we could have stumbled across it any other way as it was tucked around near to a residential area.The coffee is full of character, you will get a much better taste experience here rather than at any well known chains. It's probably the second best coffee I've had in the last year or so. Perhaps the food is a little expensive (I'm only a tourist so this could be normal) but I had the Jerk pork sandwhich which was very nice too.Well worth hunting down
4
The coffee is good,but I have tasted better. The ambient is very good. We sat outside, it was not hot or humid.
The food was ok consider their price is not too expansive...
Overall, good cafe for a drink with friends
5
...a perfectly run neighborhood cafe: great ambiance, vibe, and music programming. But also, perfectly pulled espresso shots, coffee choices, bites, and friendly service. Go here.
4
Solid place to hit for a decent coffee, get involved. Staff always friendly and coffee comes out pretty quick. Bags the couch, best seat going
4
40 hands has always been my recommendation to my friends. lovely setup, easy & friendly environment, and most important is, a good(and powerful) shot to start my weekend. :)
3
This is a nice place with lots of hype. But didn't really like the coffee, brunch nor toasties. Had the mushroom toasties and found it quite awful. Coffee is so-so. But surprised to find kong ba pau here, which tasted rather nice!
4
This had the best coffee we had tasted in Singapore, and the breakfast was fresh and well made. Tiong Bahru is the neighbourhood. Forty Hands is an excellent place to begin your walk around the area. After coffee, cross the road and browse in the fantastic book shop. Then walk around the local streets and discover other interesting small shops and the big hawker centre. Look at the architecture of the housing estate, it is interesting and quirky. All in all, the cafe is well located within the area and the staff are friendly and professional
4
Been here twice. Once for lunch 3 years ago where we tried 3 out of the 4 sandwich choices. They were OK, but not memorable.This time, we dropped in to meet friends before leaving Singapore. It's not a great place for kids as it's really small, but good to hang out with a book. Large cappuccino (SGD 7) was way too milky so not to my taste. Fresh OJ and the orange blossom carrot cake were stellar
5
Stumbled upon this place by accident while looking for a coffee fix. Amazing espresso options. Love the latte and the art is pretty good too. Their toasties are tasty too. All in all a pretty chill place. Check it out if you are in the area
4
This cafe is tucked in a unnoticable corner and we would have missed it if driving.The cafe is a bit narrow and small but there is another seating area at the back. Ordered the big breakfast and signature kong ba pau which were both yummy. But the coffee was a little disappointing.Nevertheless will definitely be back again
4
40 Hands is a great little coffee shop with sweet ambiance (remind me some coffee shop in NY Village. They serve a perfect black coffee. They have different small plates and sandwiches. My preferred is the mushroom sandwich with tasty truffle oil. The service is efficient and very gentle. The price is reasonnabl
3
Just ok didnt really like the taste of their coffee. Place is really busy during off-peak period. It is nice cozy area to relax afternoon!
5
Its the best coffee you can get in Singapore. The food is tasty. The outdoor seating is limited, but has a cool atmosphere.
4
Don't let the small facade fools you!..this place has always been packed during brunch time on weekend. Good food, good coffee. However the egg benedict is not as I expected, the eggs were too overcooked not runny as I like it.
5
Great place, good coffee and solid food. Stay away on the weekends as it gets busy. Staff are friendly and mostly attentive and helpful.
5
Well the reviews are all true, coffee is anazing and it's a funky oasis inside. I also had the fruit and yoghurt which us not very big but very tasty! Highly recommended and make sure u walk around the wet markets whilst in the area.
4
I stopped by this place to try out their coffee. Had the espresso which was strong with a tad of a sour finish. I can see this type of coffee being loved by some, and disliked by others. It really depends on what kind of coffee you fancy. For me, it was great. On a separate visit, I also had the latte which was also very good (obviously coffee flavor is more subtle compared to an espresso). Worth checking it out
4
I went looking for pasta and pizza but they sell more of toasties and gourmet sausages. Tried their truffle fries and it was delicious! The truffle taste was a wonderfully balanced on the fries. If you order a sausage, it can be bought it $6 instead of $8. Prices of the sausages are in the $10 - $20 range. Feel that it is a little overpriced. Atmosphere of the restaurant has a modern and noticed that people enjoy hanging out and chat over a cup of gourmet coffee
4
Walked over on a Saturday and was surprised we didn't have to wait for a table. It's usually quite packed with the breakfast/brunch crowd. I've been on a mission to find the perfect eggs benedict; you won't find it here. There isn't anything particularly wrong about the dish. It is just a marriage of eggs ben and eggs florentine, with the spinach hiding under the ham, and the aioli was physically present but I couldn't taste anything. It was nothing spectacular. Cappuccino was meh. The Bao was very yum. Just the right amount of fluff.It's a nice place to catch up with friends over breakfast. Love the ambience. Mixing the old and the new never gets old. !PRO-TIP: Try sitting outside, it's too hot inside
5
For a relaxed brunch or afternoon with friends or family you can't go past 40 Hands. Known as the best coffee in Singapore, they do not disappoint. Breakfast is also great. Try their Aussie saucepan for a savoury breakfast treat to satisfy your appetite. Service with a smile, always
4
Been here for brunch a few times. The coffee is excellent. Have a double shot flat white. Ah!The place is not very big, a bit cramped but still relaxed in its own way. I have the poached eggs mostly but the grilled sandwiches are good too and I believe the salmon is excellent as well.
2
I gave been here of and on over the past 18 months.
Food is a habit, coffee is a chore.
It wasn't like that before.
4
Stopped at Forty Hands and had a quick breakfast with the kids before hitting the bookshop, Books Actually.
Had lovely latte and poached eggs on biscuit. Kids had sandwich - pork and lamb and they enjoyed every bite. The carrot cake was lovely and moist..
5
I am not coffee person, but I must say their latte, service and atmosphere won me over.This is my fourth time here and their service had been consistent and good.You should be here if you enjoy coffee and a great chill out place :)Thanks FortyHands
3
My wife and I went to Forty Hands as we were told it has the best coffee in Singapore. If this is the best coffee in Singapore that is disappointing. The coffee is ok and the toast is good. On the plus side the atmosphere and the service is very good. I love my coffee and there are only a few places in Australia that have great coffee. So I have to give it a 3/5 due to the atmosphere of the cafe
4
Originally from Melbourne, I love my coffee, so when I moved to Singapore the lack of a coffee culture was cause for concern, okay, okay, agitation then! But over the last few years Singapore has discovered great coffee and Forty Hands is one such gem. I don't know about the food at this place, I come her for the coffee. In fact, I'm sitting outside having one of their coffees as I write. Yes, it's in a cool part of Singapore, a go ahead area called Tiong Bahru. Across the road, Open Door Policy is also worth a visit. For coffee lovers also head to Toby's Estate at Robertson Quay, Cafe Beviamo at Tangling Mall and Highlander Coffee at 49 Kampong Bahru Rd. Now...back to my coffee
4
I ate here one Saturday morning. A smallish cafe in a cool part of Singapore, Tiong Bahru. The coffee although a touch expensive $7.50 for a 'large' cappucino was very good, and what you would find in the cafes of Melbournce CBD. Food good - I had the eggs benedict although the 'biscuit' didn't quite work, it was nonetheless, fresh, tasty and hot. Service was super fast and staff very friendly. A nice way to spend a morning
4
Coffee house that serves breakfast all day long, fantastic coffee but the location is no where to be found. Was recommended by a friend that stays nearby, if you dont know the way around, you might miss it. Normally crowded(grab a seat as quickly as you can when you arrived) and noisy. Overall good food and not to forget, their cakes are delicious as wel
5
By chance I was staying just up the road from this cafe whilst on a short trip to Singapore so I visited for breakfast a few mornings in a row and enjoyed it each time. The coffee is strong and tasty, the sandwiches are good and the breakfasts are really filling and well put together.The service was really slick, laid-back, polite and smiley and the atmosphere is exactly what I wanted - somewhere I could while away a few hours reading, getting ready to enter the city
4
I visited Forty Hands during a morning stopover in Singapore, in search of good coffee and somewhere to wander. The coffee had good flavour, although served slightly hotter than typical in Australia (but hey, you can let it cool). I also had some fresh OJ and the Thai chicken toasted sandwich (with coconut lime flavoured chicken). Delicious, and good service. An interesting little neighbourhood to wander around - go to Books Actually across the street and look out for the Urban Sketchers book on Tiong Bahru to be released this month (Dec 2012) for a nice souvenir of the neighbourhood
4
Great coffee and snacks await you here in Singapore's quirky and cool Tiong Bahru District. It's been voted the best coffee spot in Singapore by readers of the popular I-S magazine. I read it was the owners of 40 Hands who were instrumental for this newly-transformed neighborhood.PS Check out "Books Actually" across the street. Lots of picture books and books in fiction and literature await you there
5
best coffee in Singapore is served here. Good buzzy atmosphere, super busy, but it all seems to work well. Sandwiches are devine, try the salt cod mash sandwich, sounds odd, but really works!!
4
If you fancy healthy and tasty sandwiches, simple cakes and don't mind truffle oil on your French fries, this is the place to go. Oh, and you might want to people watch...

Fancy a couple of groovy guys from Perth taking coffee to the masses in Singapore. After reading an inflight article on Singapore Airlines en route to OZ... we hit the pavement on our 1 day stopover in Singapore to find some 'real' coffee. After google mapping our way with our cab driver we almost missed our stop. Fortunately traffic moves slowly on Saturday mornings. With time to spare we were transported back to a Melbourne laneway as the staff managed to whip up a table from nowhere in this bustling cafe. Not an extensive menu but something for everyone. We enjoyed the Salmon and BIG breakfast but were floored to be presented with coffee from the gods. After a week without we were desperate for something special and Forty Hands delivered on all fronts. A quirky surprise in the mad modern mayhem of Singapore. We will certainly make another visit on our next Singapore stopover. Thanks Guys
4
I love this cafe and cannot understand where there aren't more like it in Singapore. The coffee is great and the food good although I'm not sure why people think it's expensive because isnt.The only downside is the fight for somewhere to sit, not because it's full but because the clientele are somewhat 'territorial' when it comes to hogging tables and seats and they don't share.The staff are lovely but the customers suck

Tucked away in a hidden quiet corner at Tiong Bahru, which was one of the first public housing estates in Singapore, 40 Hands certainly stood out among the old buildings being a modern and trendy looking cafe, which would appeal to students and young professionals alike.The name was inspired from the fact that an average of 40 hands are required in the production of coffee, from the initial process of planting coffee seeds to the end product of a delicious and aromatic fresh brew. What many failed to recognize when enjoying their shot of Espresso or Latte was that the history of coffee was one filled with stories of poverty and exploitation. At 40 Hands, they aimed to promote a sustainable coffee economy whereby certified 'Fair Trade' coffee beans were used, i.e. purchasing directly from growers allowing them to earn a higher profit margin. With the abundance of budding cafes, I must say that I was impressed with what 40 Hands endeavour to achieve and their business ethics.The first impression at the outset was that it was rather cramped, well explicitly, expect to brush some shoulders trying to make your way through. What I particularly favoured though was the clever use of the setting and location of the cafe at a quiet hideout at Tiong Bahru (an old public housing estate) with modern touches to its interior design, display exhibits and arguably the food served. After some 10-15mins of waiting, during which nobody seemed to acknowledge our presence the whole while, a table was finally secured, unfortunately at the rear end of the cafe and down a flight of stairs which was sheltered but in a outdoor setting, similar to what I would call a backyard. With an impressive shopfront, the latter part of the cafe was somewhat lackluster, in terms of design and layout. Some might favour the laid back setting but certainly did not appeal to us the slightest bit, especially the big electrical standing fan blowing right at our faces and food of course.1) Long Black (S$4/-)(+) High roast, slight bittersweet tang with less acidity.(+) Strong delicious aroma, certainly titillating to one's sense of smell.(-) Regrettably, the initial taste was offset by the sour aftertaste.(-) The tart flavour, such as unripe fruit persisted and lingered and had to be washed down with plain water, which was a real letdown.(-) With the fan blowing at full blast, it was not too long before my coffee dropped to almost room temperature and the sour taste was the dominant flavour.Verdict: 6.0/102) Latte (S$5/-)(+) Best among the 3 beverages, richly fragrant and well balanced in terms of sweetness. I am however a Long Black/Americano and Espresso shots person and detest any sugar or milk being added to my drink, so..Verdict: 7.5/103) Iced Mocha (S$8/-)(-) Overly sweet and certainly overpriced for the serving size and quality.(-) The coffee taste was barely discernible, with chocolate taste overwhelmingly strong.(-) Tasted pretty much like a sweetened chocolate beverage.Verdict: 5.0/104) Tau Sar Pau (S$2.50/pc)(+) The bun was very light (in terms of density), fluffy and smooth in texture.(+) The skin of the bun was good in the sense it did not stick to our teeth.(+) Red bean paste inside was rich in ingredients and only mildly sweet, just to our liking.(+) Despite the smoothness of the paste, it was not too 'liquefied' nor fluid.(+) Unique shape of the bun contrary to the conventional round shape.(-) Way Overpriced. Could easily have bought 2-3 tau sar paus at S$2.50.(-) Did not seem freshly made as it was served straight from the pau electric steamer.Verdict: 7.5/10 5) Big Boy Breakfast with scrambled eggs (S$18/-)(+) The ingredients used in this all day breakfast were fresh and of a good quality.(+) Scrambled eggs were done perfectly with a soft curd texture, just the way it should be.(+) Interesting presentation of western breakfast served on an 'old school' metal plate.(-) The portion size was evidently sparing to say the least for the price.The portion size was evidently sparing for the price though. 2 sausages, some sauteed mushrooms, minced meat (think spaghetti bolognese), 1pan fried tomato sliced in 2, some iceberg letture, 2 slices of naan bread and some scrambled eggs for S$18 certainly seemed too expensive to us since we were used to having English breakfast here in UK at pubs and they were about half the price at 40 Hands with similar quality and larger portions. Verdict: 7.0/10The ambiance at 40 Hands was good in general (with seating at the ground floor) not the lower ground level where our table was. Apparently GST and service charge was not levied onto the bill, so prices listed above were nett. Even so, we felt that it was overpriced at current standing, considering the quality and quantity of food. Do not be mistaken though, the quality was certainly above average for the food, though I would beg to differ when it came to the coffee beverages. Being a caffeine addict, I expect nothing but the best especially when it is the first cup of the day. Selling themselves as a socially responsible cafe, I was impressed more by their business ethos rather than, regrettably, their brew. Despite not being charged for customer service, one could certainly expect better attention at 40 Hands. It is not just about the price, it is about professionalism in the service industry. Many cafes and restaurants tend to attribute this aspect of the dining experience to the shortage of manpower and busy orders, but personally I felt that is but an 'excusatory' element conveniently relied upon. It should be regarded as an integral part of one's dining experience and paying no heed to your customers is certainly a taboo in my books.

40 Hands is a little bit ramshackle, but it also has two different beers on tap (one is the rather strange yet wonderful limited edition espresso beer from the Archipelago brewery) and that's something to celebrate in a coffee house.There's a good selection of cakes and biscuits; we arrived at 9:30pm and only a maniac would be drinking coffee that late; better to drink a strange flavoured beer and eat a chocolate cookie. The aroma of coffee is incredibly strong inside; definitely worth making the walk over for. (The only bad thing about 40 Hands is that it's pretty much as in the middle of nowhere as it's possible to be in Singapore - far from the MTR, bus stops, well, pretty much anything
4
40 Hands is a great little coffee shop. Think Melbourne lane ways, think Sydney boho.Gone are the days when you could justifiably whinge about no quality coffee in Singapore, now that there are at least half a dozen great Aussie influenced cafes. I'm thinking Toby's Estate, The Plain etc.40 Hands is very competently run, always busy but never have to wait too long. Well trained staff. Interesting, pretty small menu. Eclectic.I disagree wiTh earlier review on the lamb sambo, I reckon it's a winner.The little nook of Tiong Bahru is already gentrifying (or going ang mo). Popping up in the street is a book shop, funky homewares store and restaurants.I think 40 hands is good value too. When breakfast for two can total $80 at Jones The Grocer and the like, I reckon under 40 bucks at 40 Hands is pretty good.Enjoy
4
Finally, there is a place in Singapore with good quality coffee. Forty Hands is difficult to find as it's located on what is, at the moment, a relatively quiet street in an up-and-coming area. Tiong Bahru has a lot to offer, so it's not necessarily a visit out of the way for a good coffee, although in my opinion it would be worth it if it was. They offer great snags (sausages) at night with a combination of local and Australian influences. During the day I have had the toasted sandwiches - some of which are brilliant (pulled pork) but others I wasn't that fussed about (mediterranean lamb - this one sounds good with ingredients of feta with lamb but to be honest they don't work together at all). They also serve alcoholic cider and some beers if you fancy a quiet beer. There is both some seating on the street, and in a courtyard (I use this word loosely) at the back. In other cities it would be located in areas frequented by the 'arty' crowd and this crowd is finding its home in Singapore either in Tiong Bahru or Joo Chiat. One issue is that sometimes the coffee isn't great but it depends on the person making it not the quality of the beans, which have been, to date, great. It is also relatively expensive for Singapore, which is a bit of a downer
4
It was my second time at the cafe; we ordered quite a bit of food for cafe standard. The sandwiches were very tasty- could taste the freshness of both the bread and it's ingredients! I want to recommend the red bean Pau too! May seem strange to order such a snack at a place so western but I loved it!
5
It is a little hard to find and if you are driving a bit difficult to park but it is worth it as the coffee is far and away the best that I have found in Sing. It gets crazy busy but the staff were active in managing the tables to make sure that they were being used in the most efficient manner and cleaned for the next group. The cakes were really good as well
