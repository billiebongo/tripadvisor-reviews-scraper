Enjoyed the afternoon lunch.Tasted like home cooked food. Liitle spicy though for others, especially for Westerners.

Just the day we landed, we met some people in the hotel lobby while we were waiting for check-in, and talking about their experience about food joints, they recommended the Sri Vijaya Restaurant for south Indian food. We dashed there the very first day. The place serves good authentic south Indian food, but some of us found the food served too oily. Taste was good though. One thing, you must tell them to use less chillies, if you cannot take it hot ! Worth one visit at least.

This is small basic restaurant located just off the road near Village Hotel, Albert Court. The food is very simple home made. Pure vegetarian, simple food. The staff are very courteous. One can choose variety of menu. Mainly south Indian food, but can get chapattis and vegetables. The rice set meal is awesome. If you are fed of eating the restaurant type food and looking for home made stuff then can head for this

This restaurant was located near the hotel we stayed. When we walked around the hotel right after we checked-in, we found this place and decided to check it out. It turned out to be a reasonable place. We ended up having both lunch and dinner here on almost all the days of our tour. One point to consider is that our group had senior citizens who were particular about having south indian food.This is a pure vegetarian south Indian place. Good for dosas and South Indian (Tamil style, to be specific) rice items etc. We liked their paper dosas, rava dosa etc. Service is friendly and helpful. Prices are on the lower side. Please keep in mind this is a basic restaurant, so don't expect anything fancy or plush.one complaint - tea was served cold on most days
