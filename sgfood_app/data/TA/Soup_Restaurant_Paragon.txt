Famous chicken dish with salads and ginger is a must try.
Minced pork with chestnuts is delicious and good
Coconut black chicken soup is tasty. Ambience is good especially entertaining .

If you like to feel robbed eat here. Extremely expensive for such a small dish compared to other restaurants ! Keep to the soup don't order the Sweet & Sour Pork unless you like being robbed.
5
You should try their chicken, chili shrimps with tofu and the mishua! You’ll be coming back for more! They also make their own tofu! A must try place when in Singapore!

With its traditional Chinese tables and chairs, old-style overhead lamps and classical watercolors on the walls, you can tell that this is a traditional Chinese restaurant. And you can tell by the constant line of people waiting outside almost every night that this is a highly popular restaurant. And for good reason-Soup Restaurant, despite its name, serves a wide range of dishes and most are the sort of old-style Chinese food you can't find elsewhere. Although they specialise in Chinese herbal soups and offer a good variety, their other dishes ae also very good. The must-try is their Samsui Chicken, named after the Samsui women (female labourers from Sanshui province in China) who ate this dish once a year at the Chinese New Year. This is a dish of tender steamed chicken served at room temperature, which is dipped into a ginger-sesame oil sauce and eaten with crisp iceberg lettuce leaves. The dish is excellent and is highly recommended.Their herbal soups include traditional ingredients such as black chicken, ginseng, cordeceps and dried scallops, all of which are believed to be highly beneficial to health. Some of the soups do taste medicinal but this is in keeping with this sort of cuisine. Their tofu dishes are also very good as are their vegetables. They are also one of the few restaurants in Singapore that serve venison

Friends invited us there for lunch at 12:30 pm. We had breakfast at 10:30 am so we could not do full justice to the food that our friend's favourite restaurant served..Had the following dishes - (a) fish, (b) vegetables, (c) tofu with prawn and tomato, and (d) plain boiled rice. The tofu dish was the tastiest and worth trying again
3
We just ❤️ the Penang mee sua & steamed chicken and mushroom rice. In fact, more than the sam sui chicken that the restaurant is famous for.The Penang mee sua is lightly fried, not too oily and very tasty. While the steamed chicken and mushroom rice is very flavorful, with the rice absorbing the tastiness of the chicken and mushroom. Yum meh

Our lunch on our second day in Singapore was the lovely Soup Restaurant and we ordered some of its specialties like the Double-boiled Whole Coconut with Black Chicken Soup, Steamed Minced Pork Pagoda with Salted Egg, and its signature dish Samsui Ginger Chicken. Who says only MIchelin restaurants are superb? For me, our lunch at Soup Restaurant was hands down the best meal during our five days in Singapore. [And we also went to Lei Garden and Imperial Treasures.] Thanks to my cousins for taking us there
4
As with their name, Soup Restaurant, they offer good taste of soup. Good value of money, good service, and quick. We enjoy the samsui ginger chicken, fried mee sua, hometown tofu, soup of the day, fan-shu leaves, and of course soup of the day.Will come back again

Samsui Chicken and Beggar's Rice Bowl were a tasty combination for a light lunch. The ginger sauce was delicious and the chicken was juicy tender.I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't because of the extra charges that sprung up when paying the bill. 2.50 for boiled peanuts that we didn't ask for. 1.00 for a cup of water. 0.80 for a piece of tissue that we didn't need. The dishes were priced reasonably for a restaurant but in total we paid 30% more than the menu price.On top of that the waiter was quite pushy with trying to upsell a big banquet menu even though I said we just wanted a light lunch.Get rid of the hidden charges and then you will deserve 4 stars
4
The food is great! specially their white chicken platter, Don't leave Singapore without trying this since they are known for this kind of dishes. The chilli shrimp is also good. They prepare it the same way as Singapore's famous chilli crab. order extra bun when you order this dish as you can dip the bun in the sauce.... hmmm... so good! Price is reasonable specially in groups with good food
3
The location looks very nice! A lot of Chinese vases,... all around so a very nice place to sit. Food was not bad, not good, just normal. Nothing wrong to say about this place but not impressed either.
3
Only the chicken dish is nice. The rest are average. Chicken dish is a little on the pricey side.
Service is average.
4
Famous chicken dish with salads and ginger is a must try.
Minced pork with chestnuts is delicious and good
Coconut black chicken soup is tasty. Ambience is good especially entertaining .
3
The most famous dish in the restaurant should be the Samsui Steamed Ginger Chicken and the soup also very tasty.
4
We mainly came for the conforting soups. If you are into chicken or pork soup with gingseng or gojis, this might be of interest to you as well. On the plus side: You can order other dishes in different plate sizes, so you can adjust according to the size of your party and in case you want to try different dishes.On the negative side: They charge you for the peanuts and the wet towels. If you don't eat/use them, let them know, and they will take them off your check. It's super cold in this branch. No clue why they crank up the AC like that. So bring a light sweater.

Terrible service!The birthday cake I baked for my mum till 3am is being served to the wrong table.The other family finished most of the cake claiming that they thought it is free because they spent $600 and were given free abalone. You think I am stupid to believe you or are you saying that all of you are rich and stupid. Common sense will tell you a Traditional Chinese Restaurant which don't sell cakes will not have whole 7" cakes free for diners' birthday.The family claims that they were also celebrating birthday. Which family celebrate birthday and don't bring their own cake?I can't believe a whole family can be so mean and eat someone else's cake, spoiling another family's day.A decent person will tell the waiter that you don't have a cake or ask why you are being served a cake, not greedily eat the cake, try to pack it home and complain that my 7" cake is small when I confronted you guys.Waiter was horrible too! He lied to us about what happened to our cake when we kept asking him to serve, even asked me to show photo of my cake. So if i don't have photo i cannot proof that the cake is mine, that i baked the cake?The restaurant didn't charge us for the meal and compensated us, the cost of the ingredients, my effort based on a day of my salary. Still the celebration is ruined so is my weekend and all my effort baking. I am pissed with the family. If they hadn't been so selfish or have basic common sense (if they are all genuinely stupid), this would have been avoided

We came here for lunch and ordered 3 dishes for 2. We noticed their specialty is ginger chicken (pak cham kee) but it must be too big for 2. So in order to taste the chicken, we ordered claypot rice with this ginger chicken as topping instead. Quite shocked when the food came, only several cuts of chicken on top of the rice which looked like RANDOM trimmed meat in different sizes. Definitely different from a nicely sliced chicken in the menu book. There were only 2 shoots of veggies too which I found too petty. But I have to admit the ginger-garlic sauce for the chicken is actually really good.Ambient and service in this restaurant is actually good, but for the price points compared to the foods, it's definitely a No No for me. After eating here, me & my husband also experienced unpleasant mouthfeel and very dry throat. We were super thirsty eventho we had juices at the Restaurant as well.
4
Samsui ginger chicken, homemade Tofu, tofu prawns with Chili sauce, soup of the day, sambal kangkung, olive rice are all great dishes. There are other great dishes still yet to try! Wonderful place to introduce Singapore food and story to foreign friends and family. Price is mid range
5
One of the best if not the best chicken - Samsui Ginger Chicken â€“ tender, juicy and goes extremely well with accompanying thick ginger sauce. The dish was so delicious that we visited the restaurant twice within our tree day stay in Singapore. Could not comment on the other dishes from the menu, we deliberately had only chicken, but if happen to be on Orchard road, DO NOT miss this place, it is very easy to find, on the ground level of Paragon shopping Mall, next to Din Tai Fung, which is a must for a dumpling lovers

There are quite a few branches of this worth-eating-at Chinese restaurant in Singapore. We usually go to the one in the Nex mall (Serangoon MRT Interchange) but this time round, we re-visited the Paragon branch in Orchard Road.Even though they are known for their double boiled soups, they have a very variety of non-liquid dishes. Besides the boiled soup of the day (chicken with wolf/goji berries at S$6.50), we had: Samsun ginger chicken ($19.90), minced pork pagoda with salted egg yolk ($12.90), Ah Por ginger fried rice ($12.90), mantou (8 deep fried dough 'paus' at $4), and mushrooms on beancurd ($20.80). Except for the soup, which was a single portioned item, the others were for sharing. All the dishes were tasty and complimented each other well. We were also served chrysanthemum tea at $5 per person. For cold and hot water, the charge is 50 cents.As with some other Chinese restaurants, they automatically place a dish of stewed peanuts on your table for which they charge $2. Wet paper towels are charged at $.40 each. (If you do not use the latter, you will not be charged for it - same practice as at Sushi Tei).NB: What I did not appreciate was that when we bought their speciality ginger paste to take home, it was added to our bill and therefore service charge (10%) and GST (7%) were charged on this as well. This I found cheeky and just not on! So, if you are buying any of their takeaway items, check that they do not add this to your dining bill
1
Overpriced unpleasant food. No atmosphere. Bossy, fussy staff. Charged 40c for hand wipe and tried to charge for a bowl of hot peanuts we didn't order. Beware if you have a peanut allergy as they arrive regardless. Bad experience. Won't be back
2
unfortunately food was bad & disappointed and service was terrible, signalled to leave immediately after finishing the food..
3
Food is average. Nothing special. And very disappointing for us is its sweet and sour pork. We will not order it again.
5
Located in the lower level of the Paragon on Orchard Road.
Super little spot for excellent hearty soups and snacks.
4
the staff at Soup Restn, Paragon was a good experience. friendly and attentive staff .. got us a corner seat which is not so cold, also helpful in recommending dishes. recommended !
5
A must try if you like home-cooked chinese food. It is famous for the ginger chicken and the many types of soup.
4
A local colleague took me to this restaurant. I really enjoyed the food. The steamed chicken with the ginger sauce was a highlight. The twice cooked soup was also full of flavour. Good service - made easier by my colleague who understood what she was ordering.
4
I've eaten here three times now, and its become part of the meal rotation for my friends and I. It's dependable and tasty, though some might find the price a bit off putting when comparing it to a neighbourhood zi char. I ate here with two friends, eating the ginger chicken, homestyle tofu, two soups, an eggplant dish and drinks for ~85 sgd. Not too bad. Particularly like the tofu dishes here, it's just soft and competently cooked. The famous chicken is also very tasty. Highly recommended.
5
Judging from this branch, quality is consistent across its kitchens. The herbal soups are just medicinal enough without being overpowering. Try the steamed and fried pomfret with succulent flesh. The silky tofu in chilli and preserved vegetable garnish is awesome as was the duck lettuce with dace and black soybean.
4
This is part of a chain - but the food is still excellent. If you only order one thing, that would be the steamed chicken and garlic sauce (with rice of course). Everything else is an add on to this most wondrous of meals.Definitely book a table, or risk the potentially long queue. Note that the restaurant only holds bookings for up to 5 minutes - so arrive early or rejoin the queue!
5
We are dining here frequently and it's a must to always order the Samsui Ginger Chicken. I bet you will also love it. The price is definitely reasonable for a location such as Paragon.
4
We liked visiting the outlet for home cooked simple Chinese dishes. Our favourites include the chicken, minced pork dishes.
We enjoyed the brisk and friendly service.
4
was tied of shopping wanted to have quick bite so visited was impressive with ambiance food was good different
2
We totally understand that being in Orchard Road means rental cost is high but charging even the smallest things such as wet tissues is something not quite "Asian" hospitality. The food is good but given the price (which is not cheap), portionwise is unimpressive.
1
Hoping to have different experience since I hail from samsui village. But sadly the atmosphere more like fast food Chinese.
Oily food and quality has declined. Service they try but very superficial.
3
They've some staple dishes such as coconut soup, smoked chicken with ginger, and minced pork with salted fish; which are recommended. May suit a more Asian palate
Seating is not the most comfortable. Service is erratic
5
My uncle guided us here. He said his friend is the owner of the restaurant. Overall, we were 5 dining in. We ordered the good for 5 persons celebration set, I think that was it. WE DIDN'T GET TO FINISH IT. There was A LOT of food. I love everything. We love everything. We ENJOYED so much that we came back for the second time! We love the staff! Seriously, we love you guys and we WILL DEFINITELY COME BACK FOR THE 3RD TIME! Hope I see the 'maganda ako' waitress, Sir Roldan Salingbay, and the woman who wears all black and an eyeliner haha. We simple just love it here
4
This restaurant is our all-time favorite Chinese restaurant here in Singapore. It's our go-to place whenever we're too hungry or not feeling too adventurous to try out new food. We've been here too many times and each time ordered different items from the menu, with exception of a few items which we must order each time. We alway order the sweet & sour pork and they have one of the best ones so far. My other half is a fan of the dish so we've been going around to places to try this particular dish. The Samsui Ginger Chicken is also to die for. The secret is in their ginger sauce, which they sell on retail for customers to purchase. Only thing we wish was better was the barley drink, always too little seeds and leaving us unsatisfied. But I guess that gives us a reason to come back for more. Service is good, staff are friendly and pleasant. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone and would never say no to this place.

@TheKuoKnowsThe Samsui women were once the backbone of Singapore's construction industry, quite literally. Their jobs included carry building material to construction sites on their backs.They also ate some of the most basic but,nonetheless, deliciously nutritious street-foods, which gave them the energy to perform their arduous chores under unforgiving conditions.The Soup Restautant has taken Samsui street-food and elevated it to restaurant quality, whilst keeping the flavours true to their origins.The Samsui Chicken is the reataurant's signature dish. It is always attractively presented. It can be eaten either with rice or wrapped in a lettuce leaf. Either way is equally tasty. The Steamed Pork with a Salt Fish is fragrantly-enticing, if you appreciate and savour the aroma of preserved fish. Not everyone does, though. So a salted-egg version is also available.The yam-leaves are a must-try or should that be a must-fry. Yam leaves are not widely available in Singapore. I don't know why because they are delicious. Or maybe it's just the way that The Soup Restaurant prepares them.There are over a dozen outlets to choose from. I have only been to four. And all four have been a delight
4
My sister and I were looking for some healthy food to eat and stumbled upon this restaurant. The menu and pictures posted outside the restaurant look appetising so we made our reservations. We ordered double boiled black chicken soup in coconut, sambal kangkong and white steamed chicken which is the signature dish. I loved the soup. The kangkong was ok. The chicken was not "smooth" enough. It would have been nicer if we could also get some ginger chilli sauce instead of the ginger sauce alone. I was impressed by the maitre de who looks like he thoroughly enjoy his role
4
The food is excellent, hot, and well prepared. The price is very reasonable. A typical meal starts with peanuts and hot Chinese tea. The prawns with tofu and the chicken soup with chicken broth is excellent. I'll be back.
5
We ordered tofu, and other staff, i have forget, but it was so delicious. We did not tried the soup,though. The daun ubi vegetable are also nice. Love this food,so yummy :)
4
They have a big variety but we prefer the standard fare of the steamed chicken, soup of the day and fried spicy potato leaves.
Good quality, not too expensive.
3
Food are on the whole average. Chicken dish is nice.
If you want to have a taste of childhood dishes, this is the place.
Service is at best average.
5
My friends treated us to this Resto and we ordered their white chicken with ginger sauce, it was super good. The tofu was also nice and the rest of our orders were good. It's quite a wait because the place was packed!
4
Part of a large chain, this restaurant serves traditional meals based on the Samsui women in Chinatown. So we has Samsui Ginger chicken, steamed, served with lettuce leaves and ginger. Delicious. Also recommend the fermented tofu sauce on another dish. Service attentive and speedy. Queue normally outside. Order in the queue from large menus
1
Standard at this restaurant has definitely dropped. Used to love the Samsui Chicken which were always well presented but not anymore. the plate we had were cut irregularly and chunky. the ginger sauce had no 'fire' but was instead too sweet. Requested for breast meat and was told it's not possible. i understand if i were to ask for cuts from the legs but breast ?? Then the soup of the day came lukewarm with loads of oil floating. had to send it back to heat up. We ordered just 3 dishes of which 2 were really disappointing. if this continues i could see they will be left out of the competition. Super noisy but then again it's typical of a chinese restaurant. definitely not suitable for business lunch
3
After price increased, lost the value for money. Food is the same, but portion has becomes smaller.Fav items:- Chicken- Soup of the day- Claypot Tofu with sea cucumber sauceRecommended for the taste of the food. But will not return often as it is not value for money
5
I've eaten at this restaurant numerous times it never disappointed ! It keeps exceeded my expectation. The best dish of course the Samsui Ginger Chicken complete with lettuce leaves. The lettuce leaves here is so fresh & taste a bit sweet unlike lettuce in other countries. The steamed hand chopped minced pork also was the best ever. If it's sound I'm too excited cause I am because this type of restaurant is rare even though they open in my country as well (Indonesia) but the quality is different. Even the chrysanthemum tea felt above average. You think I'm over excited? Try it yourself especially the one in Singapore and you will do your self a favor
4
This restaurant outlet is very popular with tourists,especiallyIndonesian Chinese as it is located in the shopping belt ofOrchard Road. It is therefore advisable to be there before 12 noon.As my guests were late, we had to queue up but the queue managementwas efficient. You even get a menu to browrse through and make yourorders whilst waiting.As the place was crowded by 12.30 pm we had to wait for a table for eight.We ordered the following dishes : Samsui ginger chicken, honey braisedribs, grandma's fan shu leaves, hometown toufu,hand chopped porkpagoda & steamed rice.With a full house, service was slow but the wait was worthwhile forthe quality of the dishes.All of the dishes except for the honey braised ribs were good. We foundit to be too sweet, I think we benchmarked it against the Cantonese-style porkribs.The star dishes were the Samsui ginger chicken & the hand choppedpork pagoda.Food rating : 7 out of 10 points
5
No nonsense tasty soup and worth every penny. Friendly staff, helpful and cheerful. Give a try folks whenever you fancy some comfort food.
4
the queue was long and the air-con is too cold. but food was not bad, had several dishes including the soup, which is very generous as portion was quite big. prawn and vegetables also nice.
4
One of my favourite chinese restaurants in Singapore. Food is not greasy but has a light, delicate flavour. Highly recommended.
5
Been here because a friend brought us for a treat. I never thought that suck simple looking place got a nice spot like this. Will definitely comeback with my other set of friends.
4
All good local cuisine in Singapore are not necessary in a food court but sometimes can be found in a shopping mall.For those who don’t know the “Samsui Ginger Chicken”, you must go to “Soup Restaurant”, known for their Herbal Soups and home-made dishes which are very tasty. They do have a variety of dishes and overall all their dishes are Health conscience!!As it is in a shopping mall, in this case Paragon, it is a busy restaurant, and you will have to queue in line before getting a seat. Well, so far it is fast to be seated, also to get a waiter to serve you.more at:https://drinkeattrip.wordpress.com/2015/03/11/lets-be-traditional

We've been to their various outlets and it's become our comfort food for those days when we crave home cooking style Chinese dishes like granny used to make. It's also good for those looking for healthier options and vegetarian selections. Start with boiled ground peanuts. All time fave is the samsui ginger chicken, hometown tofu, tofu prawn -- order some fried mantou to dip in gravy, hometown fish belly, potato leaves, minced pork with salted fish. Not very keen on the olive rice, we find it a bit too dry. The herbal soups are also too healthy to be delicious..ha!Chinese tea is nice. Chrysanthemum tea is a tad too sweet. Beautiful Traditional interiors, very Chinese service -- don't expect too much. Just enjoy the food.
3
The restaurant bills itself as old Chinatown heritage. Menu looks very traditional to include lots of soup, main traditional dishes,and dessert. Wait time then ask to order in advance before seating is not cool for a sit down traditional restaurant. Service is rush and not personable even though they add on 10% service charge and 40 cent towel charge. Soup is excellent but fried fish with scallion is just ok. Not memorable.
3
We'd been shopping in the Paragon shopping centre on Orchard Road and decided to have an early dinner. Unfortunately we chose the Soup Restaurant, which wasn't overly busy at the time. The Customer Service given by our young waitress was initially good, then went downhill. Our tea was consistently topped up at no exra charge. Our meal (which was nice enough), was served but our vegetables didn't appear until we were half way through eating. They tried to charge us for two small bowels of pickles & peanuts which we had declined to have. Be aware that they charge 80 cents for towels!!! Remember, there will always be a service charge and a GST (Tax) charge at restaurants. We visited a number of restaurants and food courts during our stay - this was the only one that was disappointing. :-
5
A friend made an appointment with us and said he was taking us to this really nice restaurant. Apparently, he comes here every time he visits Singapore. Totally agree with him and enjoyed our lunch today. We ordered the famous Samsui Ginger Chicken, the tofu, the olive rice, taugeh (bean sprout) with salted fish, spicy sweet potato leaves. Everything tasted really good. The staff are very service orientated and pleasant. And it is really good to see a mix of matured and young staff. There is a staff in black who looks like a famous actor - we asked him if he was a famous actor and he gently said no. Maybe next time I will take a picture and you be the judge. Totally recommend you give this a try and make up your mind
4
Must try the Samsui Ginger Chicken and Hometown Tofu! They're really good. The chicken is so tender and fresh, the tofu is very soft and delicious. Me and husband always order this two dishes everytime we go to the restaurant. Haven't yet tried many other things but I believe the rest are delicious too, judging from the long line to get seated everytime we go there. Always crowded at lunch or dinner time. Be prepapred to wait, come early so you won't be too hungry waiting. Most staff speak Chinese and only a handful speaks fluent English, but we manage to be satisfied everytime we go there
4
Our favourite restaurant. The chicken is just wonderful and a must. SOP is great. The taste remains the same every visit. We always order the taufu and veg. We love everything about it from the peanuts to the chrysanthemum drink. Highly recommended.
3
This time I only take away, but in my previous visit I did breakfast here.
It's delicious and fulfilling, and the service is quite good :)
4
The chicken is tender and blend with ginger is really yummy! However the kangkung is spicy and salty.
4
Finally got round to trying their food and I was glad i did. Tried to have lunch during weekends at their United Square branch but they were so busy and I left as I hate to queue. We ordered a large chicken to share for 4 pax and requested for extra ginger sauce which was their specialty sauce. It was very appetizing and the server was very generous when we asked for a refill of the sauce. Chicken was tender but not undercooked, I hate to eat steamed chicken (local chicken rice style as i cannot bear the sight of bloody chicken) as they are typically not fully cooked. Really like their house specialty tofu, soft and flavorful. Their spinach soup with 3 eggs were very delicious too. Definitely would come back for more
4
There is always a long queue; the waiting staff rarely smile and are less pro-active than at similar restaurants. But people keep coming back for the wholesome, simple but delicious food - nutritious soups, smooth tofu, silky kangkong, and of course the scrumptious steamed chicken with its heavenly ginger sauce
5
It was my Boss treat. First time lunch and I never thought that the foods were so delicious! I didn't know what's the signature dish here or what's the most wanted so I let My Boss to order the meals. And there was this food porn named Samsui Ginger Chicken which happened to be my kind of love at the first bite. There's a unique way to eat this dish. First you need to dip a piece of chicken meat in the ginger sauce and then wrap it in a piece of lettuce leaf. The combination of chicken meat, tasty ginger dip, and refreshing, crunchy lettuce..............sooo addictive! I found myself ate the whole plate. They also sell the ginger sauce so that we could have Samsui Ginger Chicken feast at home. Kind of regret that I didn't buy one
4
We went this time to the Paragon location which is very popular.You are immediately in a very pleasant Chinese "chic" ambience with typical furniture and decor. This restaurant may not suit the non-Chinese or non-Asian palate. The speciality is medicinal soups, each recommended for different ailments. They are nothing like any other soups as they are made with different roots, herbs, wine etc derived from Chinese medicine. Another speciality is their special steamed chicken with their special ginger sauce, which is my favorite. Personally, I always leave the restaurant feeling "light"
3
Our group of 5 had to wait for about fifteen to twenty minutes in a line. Paragon location was very very crowded. Staffs, in general, were friendly and foods were delicious. We had Samsui Chickens and Black Olive Rice and hot tea--which were all satisfied comparing to money we paid for. Especially the ginger sauce for Samsui Chicken was so tasty and savorous. A couple of disappoints though were the facts that Samsui Chikcen was NOT warm enough(served chill) and the inside restaurant was so freezing that I just didn't enjoy the overall meal time. but they said they have no control over air conditioner because it was central one. Bring extra long-sleeved shirts or cardigans
5
We had to pick a place to meet our oversea friends from Australia which spent their holidays in Singapore. The Soup Restaurant at the Paragon was the perfect meeting point. However we realized the popularity of the place at lunch, therefore we scheduled our meeting time at 11:30 a.m. To top it of, we also made a firm reservation with the restaurant one day in advance.On the meeting day, all of our were at the Soup Restaurant promptly. Our reserved table was furnished with stools which proved uncomfortable for Westerner therefore we changed to a table with normal chairs. After our greeting and sharing of personal information, we ordered several specialities of the house including their famous chicken, minced pork, steam fish and some vegetable. The portion came just the right size for 4 persons. Taste wise, it was very comforting for being tasting without extreme.We spent close to two hours in the restaurant and the reason we decided to leave was the long line started to form in front of the restaurant waiting for table. We were sure the manager of the place would love to have another table for their anxious guests. However the waiter still refilled our cup with fresh tea without any sign of rush. This I call service
4
I wondered why this place is always packed, and figured out quickly.Delicious Ginger Chicken (MUST order), traditional soup (cures everything), excellent, fast and efficient service. Yummy food without fuss.Not a place to hang out for hours, but suitable for a quick lunch or dinner
5
My wife and I have enjoyed eating soup here before. The service is excellent, the Boston Clam Chowder and Ghoulash soups tasted just beautiful and were value for money. Quality and cleanliness excellent also. We recommend.
5
Loved their traditional Samsui Chicken and home-made tofu. Friendly service and lots of locals eat there :)
4
Might be one of the chines soup places if went in singapore so far. really good quality for a resonable price.
5
Despite the name, the restaurant serves many other dishes in addition to its soup selection. In fact, it is more well known for its delectable Ginger Chicken, steamed chicken with their special ginger sauce, wrapped in fresh lettuce. A definite must eat on every visit. Other dishes which we really like are Beggar Tofu, San Yu fish slices cooked in green onion, and their vegetables dishes. Of course, their selection of soups are also great, and supposedly have medicinal purposes. This restaurant is definitely a MUST TRY
3
This is a busy restaurant, no matter which branch you visit, but the wait time is reasonable. Service is good and it is famous for its steam chicken and catfish. However, if you wanted to try this restaurant out, just order the steam chicken and nothing more. Other dishes are pretty standard taste, nothing of a surprise. This place is not cheap though
4
This is one of my wife's favourite restaurants and we recently had a family dinner (8 adults, 4 children) at the Suntec City branch. Staff were helpful but don't expect English to be spoken really well at some branches. Nevertheless, service was fast, almost too fast perhaps with all our orders coming within 20 minutes. Cuisine is largely Cantonese with some Hakka thrown in. Loads of comfort food options for locals but the standout dish has to be the Samsui Ginger Chicken. Lovely steamed chicken wrapped within a lettuce leaf and garnished with cucumber slices, a generous amount of finely chopped ginger and sliced red chilli - yummy. If you like chicken rice, chances are this will resonate well with your tastebuds. The restaurant also tries to provide a history of how this dish originated amongst the migrant samsui women who contributed greatly to nation building in Singapore in the early-to-mid 20th century. Not sure I believe all of the story but it's a good one nonetheless
5
This Chinese restaurant @ Paragon here has quite a waiting list for seats but it's worth it with all the fine food. It has branches in cities like Singapore, Jakarta n Kuala Lumpur. Food is served in Chinese style with chopsticks n the likes. It's specialty is the steamed ginger chicken served with raw lettuce leaves to perfection. One can't find fault with the rest of delicious dishes either like the black chicken herbal soup. I love this place! It's a great place to be
4
The foods were mild, it is good for people who doesn't like spicy food. The price are reasonable. The only thing that was not convenient the waitress communicate in Mandarin and spoke a little English. Some times they changed from one waitress to another due to English problem
4
We have be patronising this reatsurant at their various branches over the years.We particularly like the Samsui Chicken, the Potato Leaves, and the Double Boiled Soups.The quality of food has always been good, the price reasonable and the service always good although some of the waitress speak only Chinese which could be inconvenient to some....Its not a restaurant I would visit frequently but definitely one that I would visit once a while for my favourite Samsui Chicken and Potato Leaves....
3
I was looking to have my lunch at the Paragon shopping mall and has decided to give this restaurant a try. It offers your regular choice of assorted Chinese menu (although more on the steamed/soup selection). If you want to have Chinese food, this restaurant is OK, nothing outstanding. Price and service match so if you want to try some Chinese food, stop by here. The other restaurants in the same food court are mainly Japanese
4
Always like to dine at Soup Rest. for the good quality, traditional selection and good service. We also enjoy the great design and atmosphere of the different outlets.

This is one of the better chinese comfort food places. Love their soups, samsui chicken and tofu. And it won't burn a hole in your pocket!!

The soup, Samsui chicken, steamed fish and vege dish and steamed pork always does it for me

Had a seafood chowder and my wife a mushroom type soup, both very salty and artificial tasting. Souperlicious at suntec prepares much better soup.

Small portions but the cold drunken chicken is good

i think soup restaurant is highly overrated.. they have averagely expensive prices for their generic, processed food that has no personal touch to it. and the ambiance sucks.

i just love soup restaurant. the soups are lovely, the samsui ginger chicken just comfort food, and the rest of the dishes on their set menu usually not bad though not all that memorable either.

These guys put a small plate of boiled peanuts on your table and charge u $2 for it. food is ok but ordinary.

Delicious chicken rice

Value for money set meal

Serves a variety of Cantonese oriented dishes where my favorite is steam chicken with ginger sauce. It'll be a costly visit though.

Bad. Food quality sub standard. Customer service is poor. Staff not paying attention to customers' requests

The herbal soups, steamed chicken and olive rice are great comfort food.

Value for $.

Chicken is nice but abit cramp as they try to squeeze too many tables in a small place.

Tasty Samsui Chicken with the garlic sauce is a must have!

Great samsui chicken

Great for a decent chinese meal. The Samsui Chicken, Sliced fish, toufu, potato leaves and soups have been quite consistent to date and they taste good.

4
chicken rice and double boiled soup!

Samsui chicken is still good but the portion keeps shrinking every time I go!

Samsui chicken is a must have.

Steaming plump chicken, marinated in ginger. Then toss in sesame oil dip and ginger sauce. The best part is wrapped in lettuce. Reminds me of wrapping popiah.Fun!

the chicken with the ginger is great.

The samsui chicken never fails to amaze!

Love the Samsui chicken with lots of ginger ...

Have not been having authentic chinese meals for quite a long time, but I do think that this restaurant does leave an impression in me. Steamed rice topped with chicken pieces & sliced chinese sausages, the other, steamed rice topped with black pepper ribs, rice dishes you don't usually find in chinese eateries. The double-boiled American ginseng soup with chicken, boneless San Yu fish slices cooked with ginger and spring onion & black pepper stir-fried vension slices are some of the mouth-watering dishes I have tried & would recommend to people patronising the restaurant (though the seats provided are rather not as comfortable - - wooden stools

Decent food

looove the chunky soups here. wish they bring back simon and garfunkel which is my favorite. the others are not too bad though.
2
Excellent for simple chinese food...Soups & stuff ...
3
Good value for money though lately it's become more expensive. No more dessert in set meals
5
Mouth watering suggestions (suitable for a 2.5-year old) include claypot tofu, steamed patin fish, venison with spring onions and ginger and sweet potato leaves. Of course the soups and famous samsui chicken are wonderful too.
3
their chicken is yummy! haha
2
Food is so-so. EXtremely uncomfortable chairs!
3
Kan Shu Ye, Samsui Chicken, Black Pepper Venison. The must-trys! Other than that, the food are just normal.
4
Great value for money. Soups are deliciously healthful and do not leave you thirsty from the MSG. Service however is mediocre and can be much improved as with most other Chinese restaurants. Go for the food, go with friends and go expecting lacklustre attitude from the wait staff
