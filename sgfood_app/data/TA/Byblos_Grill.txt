Humus is awesome and kebabs platter has lot of variety ... it is good music and good service... complimentary herbal tea was given to us
5
Walked pass the restaurant and was approached by one of the owners and he said " Try my food if you don't like it it's 50% off." Decided that there was nothing to lose and decided to give Byblos Grill a try. Woah! The food blew my mind! something as simple as Hummus and Baba ghanoush could be made so well! Coming back for sure

Very polite , humble and efficient staff . Quick service . Lebanese vegetarian moussaka was delicious .the best I have tasted ..I could keep on eating .. highly recommend .. and would come here just to eat that and the lavash they serve with hummus Other orders - lentil soup was more like broth I guess it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s not on their menu but they dint refuse Hubby ordered lamb chops as rest of the reviews recommended were to bland to his taste Head over heals on the veg moussaka he ordered the chicken moussaka but was just ok .they were kind to replace the the bread with lavash Cashh is very humble polite and genuine.offering personalised servic
5
i tried lots of Lebanese restaurants around the world and this one tasted amazing while still feeling good afterwards. falafel is perfectly fried, not to much and still soft inside with good flavor. hummus is creamy and thick. great salad. they pay attention to using food ingredients. the staff is very nice and accommodating to your needs. will sure come back

Food is great. Warm Cosy ambience. Service is great. Love it. Syukur Alhamdullilah. Recommended to try.

I live in Singapore and have tried different restaurants in the Arab Street area. However I keep coming back (and bringing friends) to this amazing place. I have had the hummus, grape leaves, tabbouleh, shawarma, kebab, lamb, greek yogurt, wrap, baba ghanoush, falafel, and fattoush. All simply amazing.You have many choices when eating on Arab Street - take it from me, this place is the one to dine at.Oh - and to drink, have a freshly made lemonade mint. IT IS TO DIE FOR
5
The owners and service team were very friendly - made us feel very welcome & part of the family. A must visit if you're looking for authentic Lebanese food. The chickpea hummus was homemade and the chicken was juicy. The falafel wrap was fresh and crunchy! We loved it & will return!This is a must visit when visiting Arab Street in Singapore.
5
Probably the best restaurant in Arab street. The food is to die for and yes the moussaka‚Äôa is a must try
5
Great ambience and decor. Such pretty lamps! Had the grilled lamb chop and it was amazing! Thanks Cassh for the lovely baklava and mint tea. Made my day. Coming back for sure. :)
5
The food and the service were excellent. Simply The best. Nice ambiance. Have to come back again. All I can say is best Lebanese cuisine.
5
Randomly walked in to eat at Byblos grill..was greeted by friendly staff...ordered the lamb mandi which turned out to be divine....i'm a big fan now...will be back real soon.
5
WONDERFULL place to chill and have a Have your meal at.Great Ambience and delicious foods! The Lemonade mint is a perfect for your thirst.
5
Awesome moussaka! Absolutely the best! Warm boss who goes by the name Cassh üòÜ Must try. Will be back üòä
5
Was there a few times but this visit was the best as Cassh came by our table and talked to us like we have known each other a long time! Food was great and ambience was lovely. Highly recommend this place for a chill out session with friends. The arabic music is a plus! Feels like I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m in the middle east! Keep it up Cassh, your presence made a difference!
5
Came here for supper after a movie at The Projector across the street. Cassh the owner and his staff impressed me and my company with their friendly service and their recommendations were spot on. Most noteworthy was the moussaka was the most savoury and flavour-laden version I've had. I especially relished the smokiness of the roasted eggplant that we were told the chef had spent hours slaving over. Cassh even treated us with a complimentary rose water-flavoured rice pudding, a really lovely way to end the meal with our Lebanese black and mint teas respectively. Thank you for the wonderful supper . We'll be back for more, Cassh
5
The perfect middle eastern ambience accompanied with great music along with variety of delicious food to choose from,the cosiness and setting will take you directly to Lebanon. Though there are similar restaurants around this place has a Lebanese chef to boot. Definitely a place to revisit
5
The staff are sensitive to the customers' needs and check on you and how the food is. We had hummus, and the grill platter which was good for 2 to 3 people. The ambiance and music takes you straight to Lebanon without the need for a passport. Will definitely be back with visitors in tow next time!
5
I had a wonderful time with friends at byblos grill.The food was delightful and interesting for Lebanese food.The mixed grill is a must try, truly mouth watering . Reasonably priced and great ambient. Will certianly come back again ‚ò∫üëå
5
Fantabulous spread of food. The Moussaka is mindblowing and the Baklava dessert was mouth watering . I like their prompt service and price is affordable. The music created a relaxing mood for dining.

We come here quite often. The food is very good. The service is good as well and just keeps improving.
Good stuff..

Middle eastern vibes on point. Food on point. I would lick out the hummus from the bowl. Planning to do takeaway moussaka whenever I pass by

Recommended by my besties and no regrets. We ordered appetizers and mains and it was cooked to perfection. The bread served hot and I ordered signature dish - lamb chops! Delicious. The ambience was relaxing and Cassh; amazing host, great personality and we were entertained! I am certain this will be my new favorite place and strongly recommends to all to try out and definitely get hooked! Kudos!

5
We were on our way to the No. 1 rated restaurant on TripAdvisor in Arab Street. But then we had a stop at Byblos Grill. Good conversation on the street and after a small walk around we came back.Very fresh food. Great Mezza plate for two. Great Falafel Wrap! Great Lemonade Mint!We could not imagine better!Come by and try by yourself!

Just went for a stop off while walking around the area. Really laid back, friendly staff. Food was really nice as well. Got the chicken shawarma, great option for lunch
5
Good Mediterranean food with a lively ambience.
Friendly staff and happy to severe us. We were even given complimentary mint tea.
Must visit for an Authenatic taste of Lebanese food. We're definitely coming back for the food and service!
5
The food was great and it has fantastic service, the Lamb Pizza was awesome. The price range is decent and the atmosphere inside is great.
5
Authentic lebanese food. We had a few dishes, the Hommous and Kafta where excellent. The service was also very good. I highly recommend it.
5
Loved the food!Ate the moussaka, and borek.Haven't really thought about moussaka being great in other places I ate , but Byblos version is something else. Not too heavy, not too light, and eggplant cooked to just right. Borek was light and gentle on the palate. See you guys again soon. Hopefully there'll be tables available next time I visit!
5
It‚Äôs a great place for family or just a gathering with friends with great service and food! Awesome mixed grill too.
5
...Great service, nice people, good food and cold beer. thanks for the great service, will come again!!!

We had the chicken shish which was absolutely delicious, my two year old son enjoyed the food as well. I will definitely visit again. The staff are also very lovely and genuinely care about their customers. Thank you for a lovely meal.

5
I've always passed by this place but haven't actually tried it till now & i wish i had done it earlier. We had the mixed grill which was a good choice if you feel like trying all the meat. It was delicious!The best part of this place is actually the atmosphere. The host is just so friendly & ensures the guest have a great time. Will definitely come back for more

One of the best Lebanese ever around Arab st. I‚Äôve had. Very nice people around and workers are friendly, manager is great even gave us Lebanon coffee on the house. Try it guys! Its promising. The lady behind the counter is üòçüòãüòõ
5
Great tasting lebanese food in a nice environment. Servers were friendly and prompt. Loved the kunafa!! Must try dessert.
1
Food is OK, but the service is awfull.
Waiter offered to bring 2 different types of bread with the meze, and then charged 7 SGD for a single slice of bread.
There are many better options around.
5
I was visit with my family and really very nice food and friendly staff service really I was happy there
5
each dish is simply a joy with its perfect blend of ingredients. Good ambience and friendly service. An enjoyable dinner
5
If you are visiting Singapore, Byblos Grill will be the best choice for traditional lebanese cuisine : hummus , kibbeh , tabbouleh , fattoush and a very wide selection of mezza and mixed grill.
5
Staff is very friendly. Bread was freshly baked and the lamb was really tender. Food is reasonably priced. Highly recommend this restaurant!
5
Very authentic Lebanese food in Singapore. Has got both vegeterian and non vegetarian options! Loved the hand made falafel and lamb chops are a must try!
4
We found the food and service to be very good. Food came quickly and was tasty.We forgot a small backpack here and the server had it stored in the back till we arrived.For us the rason it is 4 and not 5 stars is what other posts had stated, the bread.They also asked if we wanted bread, we said yes thinking we would recieve one and seeing as it is bread should not be that much. Well we recieved 2 and they where 7sgn each, pricy for bread ever for Singapore.They did serve beer so we ordered a couple of tigers not asking the price,seeing haas tiger beer was resonibbly priced everywhere, well not here $10.Would we return, a resonding maybe
4
Nice staff, good food that feels really authentic. Prices was higher than expected, but at least the food tasted very good.
3
As the titles states - the search continues in and around Arab street. Food was okay nothing to rave.
4
Mixed grill platter was full of flavour. Be sure to order th lamb chops and lassi (Aryan). May need to reconfirm your order with the staffs. Slight miscommunication may occur when placing orders and enquiries as English is not that well-conversed or understood.
3
located in the heart of nice place called arab street in Singapore
food quality is average but overll experience is wonderful in such place
2
The food wasn't really that great. The staff keeps calling people, and we ended up there to try the platter which has all medi dishes but it turned out to be really average. Even the smoothie was a diluted version of the market available flavored yogurts. What a pity
1
Avoid this place. The bathroom is literally the dirtiest toilet I have ever seen. It is months of build up of dirt. I can‚Äôt imagine the kitchen is clean if that is the state of the bathroom. Furthermore there was no soap no way to dry your hands and no toilet paper so once I had been in the filthy bathroom I couldn‚Äôt wash my hands properly I ordered a falafel wrap which took a long time to arrive. I only ate the falafel out of it as having seen the bathroom I didn‚Äôt want to chance the salad. Tasted ok.I also ordered a water which never arrived.Staff were miserable Basically just don‚Äôt bother. It‚Äôs on a street of restaurants. Pick another.

The first warning sign at any restaurant should be the overly-friendly fast-talking waiter trying to lure you in. Instantly he told us he'd give us free drinks for our two kids and then 20% off the entire bill. There is another Lebanese restaurant right across from Byblos so it seems to be pretty competitive.We ordered the mixed grill and other things and the food was excellent. It arrived in a reasonable time and was what we expected...until the bill came.On the menu, the mixed grill was listed as being $34.90. But when we received the bill it was $75. And that 20% we were promised was not there. We checked the menu again and nowhere did it state that the mixed grill price was per person; furthermore the photo was not of a single-person serving. It was very misleading.When questioned, they reduced it from $75 to $60 and then honored their 20% bait. But still, it was not honest. So we recalculated the cost and after a lot of hassle and waiting they finally corrected the bill. It started at $215+ and went to $141.I would not return

On arriving at Byblos to join friends we went through the menu and ordered a plate of lamb and asked for chicken skewers. The waiter "suggested" a mixed grill for the chicken skewers, which I said OK to. The mixed grill was enormous, and in hindsight should have sent it back, as it was over sized. We ate half. On receiving the bill, the cost of these two dishes was $200. The price on the menu was $75 for the mixed grill and $29 for the lamb. We had to negotiate the pricing down from $200 to $160.00. And yet, what we thought we were paying was probably $80 total. Basically, due to the "upsell" we were robbed on the bill, and then were made to feel awful for questioning the bill in the first place. This is a dangerous establishment - as they take full advantage of trusting visitors. We were refunded $40, but the way they spoke to us was less than civilized, and an upsetting experience

We had dinner at ByBlos Grill and ordered few dishes and believe me the taste was awesome the kababs with rice flavour was yummmmm mouth watering and Chicken was damn soft n well grilled on charcol. As usual Tea & Fries were complimentary and Kunfee OMG the King of all dessert. Of you guys did not went through turkish and Lebanese food and which is full of awesome flavors please do visit arab street and land @Byblos Gril

My wife and I were enticed into this establishment last week while visiting Singapore.The menu's offered were fairly dilapidated with pictures of what is on offer with prices below.I chose a chicken dish $14.50 and my wife a falafel dish for $12.50. On taking our order the staff member asked if I wanted a beer so I chose a can of tiger (local) beer asuming it would be at a relevant cost.Finally after a half an hour our meals arrived mindful that we were the only customers beside 6 others.On asking for the bill I was surprised that my chicken dish was now $21.50 , my wife's at $12.50 and the can of local beer at $12.50 !!!!!!!!! On querying the costs I was met with a blank expression with no explanation. I was so shocked that I just mentioned I would ensure people knew about these high costs . The food was not of the best quality and having stayed in a 5 star hotel where a similar beer was $9.50 from the bar fridge in the room I was quite shocked.If you must eat at this establishment then check your bill and query your bill otherwise visit another restaurant as there are more far superior in the area

Food sucks! Super slow service ... not worth wasting your time , don't get influenced by sales guy trying to get you inside the restaurant
5
Had an enjoyable dinner! Thanks to great recommendations from the boss! The lamb was tender and the rice tasted beautiful.
5
I've never tried Lebanese food before
But loved this restaurant
Great food
Good service
And great atmosphere
1
Service is lousy, waiters smell, drinks are outrageously priced and food is ordinary. Promised the best and delivered the worst. Mezza plate for 2, 2 wines, 1 beer 74 bucks. No drinks list so unable to price drinks before. Avoid at all costs.
1
Fawlty towers revisited! It started wt trying to order my chicken dish. I had to tell 3 different waiters about 10x. Nearly walked out! The only reason we went here was because they served alcohol and most other restaurants don't. The food eventually arrived and was of very substandard quality. The red was served cold so must have been cheap to buy (for them not me!). Overall wouldn't recommend as poor service and mediocre food (small portions at not so small prices!!) The name on the menu board does not coincide wt name on bill either
4
My first time trying Lebanese cuisine and it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s uniqueness is a good mix of grilled items and lots of olive oil... I love anything with olive oil. Something special about the interior decor is the wall which was plastered with bare hands and it takes the artist a lot of time to get it done!
1
The waiter on the street does a great job to pull you in then he ignores you and continues to try to pull others to the restaurant. Eventually managed to get his attention to order food. Although there were quite a few staff around, none of them seemed interested in looking after customers or replenishing drinks. When food arrived the shawarmas were both cold. The falafel should have come with a sauce/dip and when I managed to get someones attention, it was eventually dumped on the table. As someone else has mentioned, the staff were arguing loudly on several occasions. Will not be back
2
We ordered food and after waiting for almost 40 mins, were told that one of the orders was unavailable. We had to choose another dish which took another 15 mins to arrive. By the time the 2nd dish arrived, the first dish was served to us cold, although we had ordered the kebab grill ( which is eaten hot)! We then ordered 2 cups of Lebanese coffee, which again took forever to arrive. The restaurant was not particularly packed and staff were standing idle. Price was also too high for the plate of food served as it lacked presentation.
1
Very noisy music as a welcome ! Food was very bad and cold, food we were promised never came. Very pricy for the quality of food.Definitely a place to avoid, specially when the manager scold the waiters in front of customers ...However the strawberry juice is good, but super pricy ...
5
Lucky for us, this restaurant was ready for dinner. It was the 2nd one we walked into as the 1st one was not serving dinner till 6pm. Indoor and outdoor tables are available but we were informed the WiFi only works well when sitting indoors. The cuisine here is Lebanese and of course, we had to try the Hummus. It is accompanied with a piece of pita bread and it is smooth and tasty. Definitely a must-have. The Grilled Salmon was well-cooked with grilled cauliflower, potatoes and broccoli on the side. We were also recommended the Mint Tea to wash down our meal.The appetiser we initially chose was not available but it was just as well, as the 2 dishes made for a complete meal. A satisfactory dinner experience
