Great people who run this place. Make you feel at home and cozy. Great attitude of wait staff. Cold, very cold beer is a must in the heat and humidity. Snacks are interesting and JPN inspired, and pretty good. I've been here often and the best is the other folks who visit. Many locals and some tourists and the locals make you feel so comfortable - tons of fun and you may be asked to join in some drinking games. It's not like that every night, but just a fun, hip and cool place. Can also just chill by yourself and be left alone if you desire - but I say, just party at Juban

The staff were very friendly and having spent time in Japan, the food was very authentic in my opinion. Must try dishes are the diced steak, Japanese sliders and karaage (Japanese style fried chicken). Drinks were reasonably priced as well compared to other bars on Boat Quay. They also run a number of drink specials through the week so a pretty cool spot to hang out.

It was actually our first time checking out the Boat Quay area. Felt cozy with the breeze of wind along the river, seeing lots of bars and pubs along the river, it's quite difficult to choose which one you wanna enter, since they all seem so similar...Our friends brought us to a Japanese Pub which is totally not running by any Japanese... Cocktails are nice, there are some nice and interesting choices for cocktails. Snacks are so-so, nothing really exciting.Overall atmosphere was cozy and relaxing, is a nice chill place

The Juban Stand is close to our work and we've frequently since they opened a few months back. The owners and staff are always very friendly and welcoming. Its got a good spot at the 'quieter' end of Boat Quay, and they do ice cold Asahi direct from Japan. They also do a really good Japanese curry set for lunch & dinner - need I say mor
