The breakfast was awesome!!!! We tried the french toast, latte and scrambled eggs on croissant. They had booths so its great for dates. All in all I loved the place <3 will miss it when im back home.

Their signature coffee was good and unique (with coconut oil). Toast was filling as well.
Place is small and cozy. Go early to get more comfortable seat.
However food is a bit pricey for brunch.

Went for a coffee and got the signature coffee with coconut and a coconut brownie. Both were delicious! It's perhaps a bit on the pricey side, but not overly so. Well worth a visit!

Great place for a caffeine fix. Love their beef sandwich, not a fan of their big breakky. Service crew was extremely friendly. One of the few cafes with reasonably priced food.

I have been meaning to visit this place for a very long time now and I finally had the chance on an off day with my mum. The cafe is located along the old peranakan blocks of Telok Ayer Street which means you would normally just walk past this cafe without realising how cool and retro the decor is on the inside. You will feel a wave of old-school 70's or 80's era fall upon you as you step into the cafe. Coffee was nothing memorable but nevertheless good. We ordered their signature Avocado Pesto Toastie and French Toast with Bacon, Maple and Berries. The portions were good enough to get you full yet still able to stand up without struggling and continue walking along Telok Ayer Street. The bread was very soft which was a huge plus point for me as I absolutely hate sandwiches with stale or hard bread.It's a great cafe to visit. I would visit again only if I was around the area and up for a good old toastie

There are many reasons to go to Free the Robot. Coffee is just one of them. The decor is fascinating, hard to really categorise it. The coffee is great. The dog is hilarious. ok no go and find out for yourself, but check the times for opening and they are not always ope

I was attracted by the name and wasnâ€™t disappointed! The shopfront is very plain and I almost missed it entirely the first time I tried to locate it. It is dark and cosy inside with awesomely cool decor, posters and artwork on the walls. The food is pretty good, nothing to massively write home about although I have enjoyed the handful of dishes I have tried there so far. The coffee is awesome, definitely recommend the Free the Robot Signature.Word of warning, they are somewhat understaffed and at lunchtime between 12:30 and 2 the service can be chronically slow. They need more chefs and servers!I will definitely be dropping in again as it is a bit of fun, good priced and wonderful atmosphere.

Came across this place a few visits back and have been stopping in every time I venture back for my morning coffee fix. I don't usually try "signature" coffees but FTR's is good, coconut oil undertone compliments well.The straight black coffee is strong without being too bitter and the toasties (I had avocado) hit the spot. Well worth a visit if you are nearby

I think alot of cafe don' t realise that even if they don't charge a service of 10% but they still need to provide a basic service. This cafe for instance is very lacking in that. Advice to the management: if your staff are not trained to give condiments, at least provide set up some condiments on the table. It's frustrating when guest have to keep standing up and look for our own sugar, milk and sauce.Coffee is average. (Just by looking at the bubbly foam; guess you should know the skill of the barista)$30 per pax for average food and beverage. Overpriced. Ordered: Big BrekkySalmon & Avocado Rice Bowl Soup of the dayCold brew Latte Not coming back

Just wondering around the area and found, not much to look at from the front but once inside complete change.Been twice now, breakfast and lunch excellent food on both times scrambled eggs and meat balls and pasta. The chocolate brownie is delicious. All looks good and a great coffe

Great place for lunch with good food and coffee. All the food are reasonably priced. Love their rustic interior decor.

Great concept for a coffee place. Don't miss it as the outside is underwhelming. Inside its bustling and reminds me of a Havana cafe. Nice decor and lively inside. Great service and they have some chairs outside. Definitely worth a stop with very good coffee.
5
Great for breakfast and/or lunch. Amazing coffee! Great salads at lunch, they even do fresh juices. The bench on the outside is good for people watching.
Good vibes all round!

Visited Free The Robot with my wife and son as it was strongly recommended by a friend.
Definitely a good place to chillout with awesomelicious food. Will definitely be back to try out more stuffs.

Very good is more like it. I look at the gushing reviews below and wonder how long it will be before every city around the world looks the same. Not saying that Free The Robot is the same as everywhere, it's not. Of course it is very much the same as all the New Brooklyn, Portlandia, Berlin, Melbourne, BKK, East End exposed brick cafes of the slightly ashamed aspirational middle class world. So yes, the coffee is fine - as good as I make at home. Knowwhatimsayin? It is also 4 times the price of a local coffee. White peopel will be comfortable here. Gentrification at its finest.Practically speaking: great counter service, good vibe, much too expensive for our real 'workers', perfect selfie spot for your average Ryan and Michelle (now the most common baby names in SG, TIL), terrible banana bread, very good croissant stuffed with scrambled egg and smoked salmon

Nothing to hate about this place, the staff are super friendly, their coffee JUST DIVINE!They have some epic creations for food and everything is reasonably priced for Singapore. If you want to come and do work do it out of the 12-2pm period as that is when it is super busy for lunch.Thank you to the staff for just always being friendly and welcoming me back each and every time! You guys rock

A random find while traipsing through the Telok Ayer area. Quaint little cafe that serves a good cuppa; I had the latte which did not disappoint. The specialty (forgot the name of the burger) is homemade - no frills and served with a juicy beef patty, cheese and tomatoes. On the side I had a serving of truffle fries which were pretty yummy too. Chill setting that would suit singles and small groups.
5
Truffle fries are a win! Definitely better than PS Cafe. We had the Avocado sandwich with salmon, which was AWESOME. Bread is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, very well done. Protein bowl was also good, we had the one with beef. Meat was tender, though I had hoped for more bites. Did not manage to try the signature cold brew, but the usual coffee we had was also good!

I stopped there on my way to visiting old Telok Ayer and was surprised to see a robot themed cafe. It's a really cute place that becomes a bar at night. I had the Kopi Cola which I didn't really like but the place had a good vibe.

Our first breakfast in Singapore and our friend who lives here recommended we try this place out. Breakfast was great opting for the big breakfast which certainly filled us up for a busy day ahead. Coffee also really good and the staff extremely friendly. Find it you won't be disappointed.
