Yes, impressive place, great food however with overpriced wine. We recommend this place with friends or family!
5
We where staying in nearby condo and visited this place 2x during our recent stay in Singapore. My favourite is the goody green.
Food serving was big.
They have good service and nice restaurant.
5
Highly recommended for its ambiance, the roof terasse has a great view. Very good food and wine selection. A wide range of choices ranging from European to Asian. I liked very much the Kashmiri lamb chops and he St Louis ribs.

Had a meal here when visiting relatives in Singapore on recommendations, lovely restaurant, friendly staff, but that where the compliments stop as far as I'm concerned. we ordered our meals and after about 20 minutes the meals came apart from mine, we waited a few minutes and I told the rest of the company to just start to eat their meals as I thought mine would shortly follow. everybody was almost finished their meals when I stopped a waiter and asked him about my meal and he apologised and after about 3or4 minutes my meal arrived. I had ordered Lulus Leftover Lasagne and that what it tasted and looked like, it looked as though customers plates had been scraped into a dish an pasta sheets laid on top and more leftovers put on top and baked. there was virtually no meat in it even though the menu said meatballs and I managed to eat half and left. we had some lovely meal during our time in Singapore but this meal was one of the worst I have had anywhere and it is not a cheap restaurant
4
My first visit to PS Cafe, and it didn't disappoint. For a cafe, the price point is rather steep. However, the young staff gave very good service. I requested certain changes to my meal from the menu, and they were happy to accommodate. The salad was seasoned very well (no overly heavy, bottled dressings here!), and the burger patty was cooked the way I wanted it. They offer a good array of smoothie/juice/brunch cocktails on their drinks menu, but I can only attest that their flat white by their young barista is excellent
4
We had dinner at P.S Cafe Ann Siang last 14 December, with my work colleagues. Since it was December, we made reservation at least 3 days in advance just to make sure we have seats =) and yes, when we reached there, the place was a bit crowded.Ambiance - we loved it. It was very nice, and if you go as a couple, can be considered as a romantic one. But since we went there as a group, we found it very homey.Food - two thumbs up! Portion is quite big and it is really delicious. Even my vegetarian colleague enjoyed it.Definitely, we will be back to try the other food options or maybe try your other branches
2
Arrived at 12:00 for our lunchtime reservation to be told the turkey Christmas lunch was unavailable and that we needed to vacate the table by 13:30. Nice start. So, ordered from the menu. It was OK, nothing special. Its a nice venue but the food is ordinary. Decided to take a cab elsewhere for desert, coffees and cocktails.
4
Ambiance - nice, i like such kind of restaurant setting and designFood - nice, I like what i ordredDrink - not getting anyDesserts - Can't recall what i had but i don't have bad memory on thatPrice - high for me, for a brunch i think i spent close to $50 per pa
5
Huge portions of yummy food with divine desserts. Surroundings are green and quaint and the inside is even better with a mix of quirky and old. Waitresses are friendly though staffing seems a bit thin and so their attention is hard to get. Wide range of items on the menu to suit all appetites and tastes.
4
Made a reservation for lunch this morning and it was fuss-free. Upon reaching the cafe on time at 11.30 a.m., it was mentioned that the upper floor of the cafe will only be opened at 12 p.m., which i find it amusing. Nevertheless, the group of 4 settled down on the ground floor.Ordered a few main courses including the ribs, lamb chops and laksa pesto alongside the truffle fries. Overall, the quality was alright but the truffle fries tasted quite bland, given that it was one of the regular items that i will usually ordered.Overall, the service was prompt as usual but i guessed it is time to visit the new outlet at One Fullerton. Hopefully the truffle fries taste better there
5
I went there on Sunday night as a group of 6. We all enjoyed the food, especially the pad thai salad. The portion was generous and service was prompt.
5
I ordered the crispy calamari to start and the steak frites as the main. The food was delicious and very filling. All this was washed down with a mint and lime fruit soda which complimented the meals well. The food was very flavourful and everything worked well. The decor is very nice and cosy and the service throughout was great. There is a nice rooftop which provides some amazing skyline views and has outdoor seating. The Attic Bar on the top level is definitely worth passing by. It does get packed during certain hours so I'd recommend making a booking beforehand to avoid waiting. It is definitely a tad bit more expensive but with food quality and service it is worth it.The nearest MRT stations are Tanjong Pagar, Telok Ayer and Chinatown are all less than 10 minute walk to the cafe. It is located at the top of Ann Siang Hill and a bit hidden from the street. Don't pass it up
4
Our party of 3 had lunch here on a weekday and are very happy with the nice ambience and attentive service. We chose the crab meat mee goreng from the Asian menu and found it pretty average as compared to the grilled octopus and the pan seared halibut which were far more delicious. This is to be expected since PS cafe is really known more for their cafe fare rather than Asian dishes. For sides we had the truffle fries and ended the meal sharing the large and delicious lychee lime sundae which the cafe agreed to divide for us into 3 servings.It would have been a lot more comfortable if we were only meeting for light bites and drinks since the tables are fairly small and so we felt a bit squished once our orders arrived.Nevertheless with the cafe looking out to greenery and being right where Ann Siang park, it emanates a very pleasant vibe. Certainly you feel great just being in the space and we can see ourselves returning
5
Very attentive service on a weekday at lunch. Menu was comprehensive and food was delicious. Portions are big so come with a big appetite. Date pudding with toffee sauce was yummy. Profiterole was so-so though it was sizeable. Lychee lime drink was wonderful too. Definitely worth a visit. Ambience is cosy and design of the place is unique as it's in a pre-war shophouse with nice views.
4
I visited this restaurant recently with a bunch of colleagues for after-dinner dessert and drinks. It was my first visit and was struck by how cosy the interior was, with the first two floors intended for proper dining with the bar and outdoor seating located on the top-most floor. Naturally, I can't comment on the food as we didn't eat here but the portions of the slices of cake we ordered were very large, with some of the them accompanied by a side of ice cream. We had originally wanted to sit outside in the open, but that area was reserved for guests having drinks only. Nevertheless, the table we occupied next to the bar was adequate. Figure it'd be a good place to head back to soon for dinner. Till then...
4
I ordered P.S sandwiches, calamari and mint lime for drink. Taste of food was quite nice, sandwiches served with small side salad, dressing was a bit sweet but they balanced it with sliced pickle. Sandwiches was similar as BLT sandwiches. Calamari was a bit crispy and soft.Wait staff were polite and provided a good service to me and the other customers.I quite like this restaurant and it is near a hotel I have stayed
3
Went here for Sunday lunch after having such a great experience the week before at the Harding Rd branch.Food portions and quality were still great but the customer service experience was lacking.The girls that served us just didn't really offer any personality and didn't have the initiative or general customer service mindset. It was very much one of the "robotic" style of service that seems to be quite common in Singapore.Restaurant is a lovely space with great decor and so much potential however let down by just the "blah" customer service. Considering they weren't even that busy, and the price you pay for food at PS. Cafes, can't help but walk away disappointed by this visit
4
This place has become a regular of mine over the past few months. Great location, food wise excellent great choice on the main menu esp. if you like fish. Their daily specials are great and very tempting as well. The desserts are to die for... Staff are very friendly and welcoming. They have a great wine and cocktail list along with some good gins. Would recommend that you book in advance esp Thur, Fri and Sat. On the top floor of the venue there is a great bar that is popular in the evenings which also has guest DJ's on some nights. There's an outside area as well
5
My office colleagues chose this place for our Team Dinner.The ambiance was beautiful and the furnishings are well appointed. Space is adequate from a team dinner to a romantic dinner. You can surely find the right spot in their resto. The food was outstanding. I ordered the lamb and it was so good. My colleague ordered other things but they looked very good as well. We also enjoyed the beer with our dinner and it made the whole experience fun and light.The staff were friendly and attentive which also made the experience great.Would I recommend this place?YES - ABSOLUTELY!!! Go ahead (I'm not stopping you
5
2nd time here, this place just gives the romantic vibes with the dim orange lights and decor. We came for dessert and drinks, and ordered the ice cream with sticky pudding, and some white wine. A great place to chill out with friends and loved ones
4
Recommended by friends and PS Cafe did not disappoint. Lovely ambiance, very nice service, and good food. I was told I "must" start with champagne and truffle fries and it was a perfect beginning.
4
European cuisine, good quality.
Do not forget to try the desserts.
Reservations will be necessary, the place is most of the time fully booked.
4
We had a great meal here. The short ribs were superb but only 2 left so you had to be quick. Very attentive service. Well done.
5
This establishment is well hidden with a english country architecture! Was given a table at the entrance due to the place being full but would have loved it if we could have a table upstairs! But nonetheless the desserts did not disappoint us!
3
The rickshaw crab and pork tagliolini may have been a little overnamed for dry wonton noodles but was great, as was my friend's turkey sandwich. A perfectly good wine list, pleasant decor and P.S. Cafe (at least this branch) is an easy recommendation for a catch up dinner
5
I really like this place and I have been there more that 3 times. The food is always very good and the environment very warm. Service is good even if last time there were a little bit slow. For sure it's a very good selection for dinne
5
I always find a new cafe to go on the weekend and this time is PS.Cafe. I went there around 11am for brunch and it was really quiet and not so crowded at that time. I order an americano and Ps. Classic benedict which it didn't disappoint me. The price is above an average of other cafes but the taste and atmosphere are worth the money (for me).
5
I had dinner once early February 2017 and I went back here again mid February. This place never fails to deliver great food and service. What I love about PS. Cafe Ann Siang Hill is no children are allowed, but probably that rule applies on weekdays only. When we visited it on Sunday, we saw no sign of it and there was customer with a kid, so we assumed Sunday is considered family day so they didn't apply that rule (which I kinda sad because what makes PS. Cafe Ann Siang Hill so special is that "no-children" policy)
5
The PS Cafe branch in Ann Siang Hill (near Amoy St.) provided a fantastic dinner among work colleagues the other night.Ambience was the best for either a quiet romantic meal with your wife and family or a lively dinner with friends. Soft lighting prevents strain on your eyes and gives diners a cozy environment to enjoy their dining experience.We started our meal with the following appetizers: - Crispy calamari with a rich dip- Truffle shoestring fries- Crisp and three dips (combination of baked thin slices of ciabatta, Turkish and baguette plus Long grissini with 3 special dips)- Vegetables and three dips (carrots, celery with 3 dips)The fries had a fantastic truffle flavor and scent. So inviting!For the main, I enjoyed the big slab of St. Louis Ribs (baby back ribs) with long strands of coleslaw. Baked potatoes with sour cream accompanied this dish. Heineken draught was a perfect match to this meal. And one way to end it is french press chrysanthemum tea. Great dinner with truly good service.Deserves a return visit
4
It was my 1st visit to the highly anticipated cafe. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by staffs. Ambient was good tho. Love the Roster CNY tree deco, nicely done. We waited rather long for the food to arrived. Order a Kashmiri Lamb and the dessert, Sticky Date were both amazingly mouth watering and great for the taste buds. Love them! Overall, amazing food and great ambient. Kudos
5
PS Cafe is tucked away at the top of Ann Sian's Hill. Restaurant has a tasteful interior with beautiful fresh flowers. Food was delicious especially the truffle fries. Great selection of non alcoholic cocktails.
4
Nice food, great service, and beautiful ambiance on the hill. We will definitely come back for second visit and recommend to others =)
1
I am a rather good customer of ps cafe, quality, atmosphere, ...first time i step in the ang sing Hill branch. Well 10mn with No one coming and say hi and make us wait for a table. Nothing, even though waiters were passing by close to us every second.Bad service, we left ...bye by
4
I confess - i just order the same thing every time - the Superfood salad. Its just so good that I don't see any reason to deviate. I also love the venue and I sometimes wonder why it isn't more packed - but it is a tad out of the way
5
Interior decoration in black and white. Very elegant and quite nostalgic of the colonial era! Staff very friendly and quick sevice. Havent tried the food. Ordered drinks and dessert. Gin n tonic was really tasty prepared with an alternative to Bombay Saphire gin. Crumble apple pie was delicious. My kind of place. Definetely Id return back if in Singapore
4
First time to PSCAFE at this outlet. It's was to that hard to find at first.. it's located right at the TOP and last corner or Ann Siang hill! Love the ambience there, very classic and clean. I made a 13paxx reservation and poor staff mervyn has to entertain the big group of us. I would suggest this place good for gatherings and of cause not to forgot about the delicious food, esp the truffle shoestrings fries! Food were rather quite big in portion so please take note! Will definitely come back :
4
This is a great choice for brunch. Nestled above historic shop houses, this nicely renovated and decorated spot serves food that is good (but not great except for burgers) and always beautifully presented. Extensive cocktail menu and friendly, unobtrusive waitstaff. Flavors could be a bit more robust and the cakes should be moister but the atmosphere is divine
4
When I bring friends to tour in Chinatown, I almost always take them to this restaurant. What can I say, the menu is extensive and imaginative, the food is good, and the ambience is very relaxing. I don't think I ever had a bad meal in this restaurant. The last time I went, I had the fried chicken, which was delicious. The truffle fries, a must-order in this resto, was a great appetizer. My partner's mum ordered the eggs benedict and I almost wished I ordered that because it looked great. From her feedback, it was very good
5
PS Cafe never fails to disappoint. Immaculate locations, immaculate service and top notch food. We always leave happy!Ordered truffle fries (very good), Singapore Chilli Crab Cake (not bad, dip could have been more imaginative), Crab Tart (this was the only disappointment, it was dry and lack flavour), Miso Cod (excellent as always), Beef Burgundy Pie(brings one back to a feeling of English pubs), PS Burger (huge and juicy), Ginger Brulee (the spicy tang of ginger balanced the creaminess of the brulee), Sweet and Sour Pie (lovely, for those who doesn't like it too sour), topped it off with excellent coffee. Highly recommended place, love the ambience.
5
PS Cafe has a number of locations in Singapore - the Ann Siang Hill restaurant is close to my office. We frequently dine there for special occasions and i also order takeaway to the office.Menu is western and fresh and has sometimes an Asian or french twist with their specials. Cocktails are great and the staff are friendly but perhaps sometimes a bit TOO OTT and efficient.Truffle fries are great and their Caesar Salad is good (but they should use breast and inc anchovies) other dishes of note are prawn cocktail, croque monsieur and also chicken parma. Their cakes are to die for!Little touches like hand written notes when deliveries come are very much appreciated - esp with cookies to have post your lunch
5
This is the third time eating here. The atmosphere is sublime and the meal was delicious. Always a favourite and a lovely part of Chinatown.
5
I have always enjoyed PS Cafe whether at Palais Renaissance or its sister Chop Suey but... the restaurant/bar at Ann Siang Hill remains a favourite with its grown up vibe. We had dessert and cocktails here after dinner down the road for a change of scenery. It didn't disappoint. Huge drinks list with cocktails, spirits & wines and the best cakes & puddings city centre or elsewhere. Great service too.
3
We enjoyed a nice evening at PS.Cafe but the decent food was spoiled by the ridiculous service. The waitress insisted on pouring out room temperature wine the moment anyone took a sip from their glass. Another waitress whipped away completed main course plates the instant we put down our knives and forks, leaving others to feel slow and embarrassed. The cheque was produced almost instantaneously-they couldn't wait to be rid of us! Don't go for a relaxing evening
5
You know you are in for a good thing when your French colleagues always select a restaurant for its croque monsieurTry it and you won't be disappointed.The staff were very attentive, there was zero wait for our table and we were in and out within the hour.Just what we needed for our business lunch
5
The food here is great. They have a wonderful selection for Bruch and the service here is good too. PS has a lot variety of cakes and I would recommend their chocolate cake.In the evening, its a nice bar concept and a good place for meeting friends and relax. They have a roof top access and its a nice place to go to have a view of the skyline. The food is a bit pricey but worth it
4
Been to 2 different outlets countless times, both Palais Renaissance & Ann Siang Hill outlet. However, prefer Palais Renaissance outlet food. Don't think the quality of the food is consistent throughout the outlets. The salad they have is good. The truffle fries is wow. I have tried the crab tart-unfortunately not to my liking. However, miso cod, chicken and lulu's leftover lasagna are nice. Do go if you like to savour truffle fries, one of the best in town
5
By far, PS. Burger is my favorite burger in the island. Perfectly toasted buns, thick and juicy medium rare patty, melted cheese and toppings like spinach and deep fried onion slice add original flavor. I have been a fan of PS. Burger for three years now.
5
I have treated myself twice at this location while traveling alone on business. The staff is very friendly and it is one of the few places in Singapore where they accommodate my gluten allergy without any hassle. The bartenders pride themselves in making excellent cocktails and the food is beautiful and delicious
4
Was a favourite for my wife and myself while we were living in Singapore. Today I went there again after a hectic day in Singapore over my business trip. Everything seems reaming largely same iro deco, service, food and etc. Thoroughly enjoyed and will miss there
5
If you are in the area treat yourself to an afternoon pitstop at P.S. Cafe - I can personally recommend the peanut butter chocolate cake. There are also gluten free options. A great atmosphere with leafy views through the first floor windows. A relaxed vibe and friendly staff make this a great choice amidst all the many options in this are
5
Love the food here! Every time I've been here, the service has been great and the food excellent. The variety of cake is unbelievable and always a must after a generous meal here. One of my favourite places for truffle fries.
3
First the good stuff - my colleagues enjoyed the non veg food and especially the lamb I am told was exceptional. Ambience is nice and it can well accommodate large groups.On the flip side - veg options are very limited and they did not seem to be too flexible on making off menu items (did not make effort to suggest any) or accommodate changes in on menu items . The soup (tomato) was good quantity but average in taste though the pasta was excellent. This was my 4th visit to the place- and unfailingly the bill somehow takes time to be settled Will visit again only if there are more vegetarian options
3
You can call yourself a cafe but once the prices go above a certain level you will be judged as a restaurant. This is the fundamental problem with PS Café.As a café it is great but as a restaurant it is average.The tables are small and close together - this isn't a fundamental problem but we had a noisy table of 6 next to us who kept coming and going - everytime someone squeezed in or out we were in danger of toppled glasses of wine. Overall there is a good café ambience.We ordered a bottle of Shiraz $75+++ and reminded the waiters several times. Eventually after half and hour, and after we had finished our entres, the wrong bottle arrived at our table. We were then advised that the bottle we had ordered was out of stock ! Please train your staff, correct your wine list and improve your service. A replacement bottle finally arrived in time for our main courses. We also waited a long time for the requested water to arrive at the table. The food was good - tomato soup and calamari for starters. The spicy prawn pasta was overly oily and the sirloin steak ($65+++) was well cooked but not outstanding. Deserts (typically about $14) are probably the strong point, although my sticky date pudding had some baking paper stuck to the bottom which detracted somewhat.Overall a good experience but the prices are a too high for what you get
5
We found the interior of the café to be charming. There were lovely flowers around. Loved them. We liked all the food we ordered. The muesli, spicy shakshuka to be real value for money. The service was ok. They serve nice, cold water with grapefruit, lime and apple. The ambience was nice and we enjoyed being there for brunch.We had booked in advance and were a bit put off by being told before we went to the table that we had the table only 2.45 pm
1
sitting in a restaurant eating dinner the service team asked "would you like dessert" after thinking we decided to head to our favorite place PS cafe to have a slice of delicious cake. Arrived and sat at the bar, ordered cake and coffee. Coffee arrived but no cake. We waited, still no cake. More waiting, no cake. After finishing the coffee and waiting 30 minutes we asked the bartender Patrick "is the cake coming soon?" and he replied "ya, ya, ya, ya". We waited, still no cake. We looked at Patrick to see if their may be a sign of cake but he was now upset and not willing to help in our pursuit of delicious cake. So, we told Patrick to cancel the cake, paid the coffee and left. The sad part is this, they had cake, we wanted to eat cake, we walked all the way their to have a great experience and this guy Patrick was able to ruin what should have been a great ending to a great day. Well done Patrick you get the award for being totally useless and your attitude was disgusting. keep your cake we will find another favorite place
3
We went to have dinner at PS Cafe on a Friday evening and this was not our first time. As usual, we had to wait for about 10 minutes before the waiter brought us up to the dining area at level 2. We ordered the cheese sandwich for starters, the beef steak sandwich for mains and the brownie for desserts. We had informed the waiter to serve the mains after we finished our starters. As we were having our cheese sandwich starter, the waiter arrived to serve the mains. We told them again to serve the mains later after we are done with the starters. After we finished our starters, we had to wait for about 10 minutes and finally managed to inform the waiter to serve our mains. Another thing to note is that they appeared to have reduced the portion of their servings for the same price.The food is of good quality and taste esp the cheese sandwich, the steak sandwich and the truffle fries. The brownie is average and it is half made of marshmallows, which we do not like.Not coming back unless we have craving for truffle fries
5
Inside, it looks like a European old café, a bit classy but not too fancy. On Sunday, for brunch, we had to wait for almost half an hour; keep that in mind! The food? Well, probably the best brunch we had so far in Singapore. All the mains are a bit pricier than usual (between 20 and 30$) but they are worth every cent in my personal opinion. We had the "croque monsieur" and the "all day breakfast", both truly amazing (with a preference toward the first one). The truffle fries are good, but definitely too many. I'll suggest to avoid them unless you are veeery hungry. We also tried the mint and lime soda: so & so; you can easily live without it, especially since they serve you complimentary apple flavored iced water (like many other cafés in town)
3
We'd heard a lot about this restaurant, specifically the one at this location, so we were looking forward to trying it. The restaurant itself is lovely and the food we ordered also delicious. Where they fell short was on cleanliness and service, otherwise the rating would be higher. When I sat down I couldn't help but notice a few smears of dried food on the tablecloth. My guess is that whoever last graced that table had used it to wipe their hands. The paper on the table is changed but staff should probably give the tablecloth a quick check before setting up for lunch. Back to service...when we arrived inside the main doors we had to wait around for quite a few minutes before someone showed up to greet us. There wasn’t a staff in sight although there were a few patrons at the bar. We had reservations and there was also a sign that clearly asks that you wait to be seated, otherwise we would have ventured upstairs on our own. Someone finally arrived and directed us to head up one floor. On the 2nd floor we stood around again waiting for someone to show us to a table. We had to wait quite a few minutes and ended up taking some menus off the counter to peruse. When we were eventually seated and between ordering our drinks and our food (which thankfully came out relatively quickly), the lunch crowd got bigger and we could tell that they must have been short handed as two of the wait staff were constantly rushing around. When we arrived there was only 1 other table seated so we were not sure what the hold up was at that point. They were prompt when we asked for the bill though. Go figure. Bottom line - food is good but service is mediocre. Wouldn't rule out giving it another go but there are hundreds of other restaurants out there waiting to impress
5
Went here for breakfast. A friend of our kept raving about how this place was good last time they came. She said it can be pricey but the food is really good. It was also walking distance to the place we were staying which was a plus. The place was so beautiful. The staff were very nice and accommodating. The place could get full though I guess we came early so we were able to get a table right away.
5
I love the ambiance whether we went there for Brunch or Dinner (countless)Do go to level 2 if you are here for brunch and move on to Level 3 if you are coming for Dinner.At level 3 you will find an alfresco area with a view to Singapore Business District with its colorful lights in the nighttime.I can recall one of the staff name but he do remember my partner preference whenever we go there.An applause for their attentive service.The foods, I love my Morocco Miracle Stack, Portobello Mushroom Stack or The Spicy Shakshouka.It is just a hearty meal with all the goodness ingredients.Do try their Bloody Mary, recommended as a starter for your brunch.Get the punch of the spicy taste to wake you up instead of coffee
5
A perfect venue for a business lunch or intimate dinner.. With delicious food, friendly service & no small kids allowed, this is an upmarket restaurant with its own loyal clientele..
5
Gorgeous restaurant, nice treat. Overpriced delicious double chocolate cake and coffee.Truffle parmesan fries are a must have.
4
Great selection of food and all taste so good. Their coffees are also delicious. Make sure not to miss their desert
5
Located on a small hill. Nice decoration and charm for chill out after a long day visit in Singapore. I was invited by Singaporean friends. Nice dessert and drink
5
Such an ideal venue for all catching up sorts of occasion. GF date. Romantic date. Group date. Name it, this particular PS Cafe is very cozy and is really perfect for people who would like to dine and enjoy a relax conversation. The only thing this place doesn't allow are kids (which is actually the reason why it's perfect for adults who would like to have a venue with good food away from kids running around) As of the menu, mostly western. Definitely awesome food! And midrange price. Most of the time, I'll have pasta (coz i simply love their "king prawn aglio olio") and a glass or two of Pinot Noir - Red. Per head (just main and drinks) would be around 50-60SGD. With good ambiance, great service and mouth watering food, I'd say very reasonable spending. This particular Cafe is actually the usual venue for me and my GF's to dine and catch up! Must try
4
Tucked out of the way at the top of Ann Siang Hill, just around the corner from Club St, one of my favourite diners in the City. Good food, great service, and a variety of spaces to enjoy, with a casual bar on level 1, a more formal restaurant on level 2, my preferred dining area on level 3, with an additional bar on level 3, and an outside terrace on level 3 for after dinner drinks and a view of the city.Often busy at the weekends, so I recommend booking.No smoking on the roof terrace for those that need it
5
Great food. I ordered the Pad Thai Salad ... it was sooooo yummy. And their chips are to die for. The cafe is styled beautifully. Gorgeous flowers everywhere (even the toilet!
4
This was a lovely cafe with great ambience for both the dining area as well as the decoration. Many of the breakfast selection was definitely with standard. Service crews were friendly and presentable
5
I'm always back here for their Truffle Fries and pasta. Complemented with an old world charm ambience, the food and service is an experience always above my expectations. Parking is convenient. Area is secluded and private; great for couples or solo dining if you want alone time.
2
I always wanted to eat at a special place in the center of the city and here it is, this restaurant is located in the center of raffles, Chinatown and tanjong pagar. Very nice food for the price you pay but service totally sucks i will give zero for the service. Amazing food, good location and expensive. Always crowded with Europeans but 1st floor is generally empty, i been here couple of times and i love the food here though the service is bad. The filipino waiter if i recall his name victor or something, was bloody rude during my second visit and for this reason i have stopped going there. I will still go to their other outlets for the good variety of food though its pricey. If you are looking for a good service dont go here there are many choices around that area maynot have the same ambiance though
4
Best Tomato super in a long while. I have stumbled on this recently and now have it often its a total fave!
4
Good food, great surroundings and excellent service. Always a pleasure to eat here. Only downside is the damage the puddings will do to your waistline!
4
Had a team dinner here which was fun - good location to access other bars after dinner. Had a good Steak and great Ginga Kogen Beer! Service was good but a bit slow at times.
5
Love the truffle french fries here! Love the outdoor seating. This is a must-visit place whenever I come to Singapore.
4
Lovely restaurant a flight of stairs above the street. Situated in a conserved neighbourhood the restaurant is located a heritage building with the most amazing old world décor. Real flowers, wrought iron tables, wooden staircases make this café a charming little place. The food is excellent, service is attentive and the bar well stocked. Do not miss the lovely terrace on the top floor. The café does not allow kids and is open to teenagers and above
5
I went with some friends to Truffles Thursday and met lots of friendly gay men both local and expat. The food was delicious and the portions big, but this is also an expensive place to eat and drink.There is a roof top terrace where you can drink and mingle after eating. The first Thursday of the month is the busiest because it's just after payday!The bar staff were very friendly and although busy managed to get orders going fairly quickly, apologizing if they were delayed. Would absolutely go again
4
It's a little bit up on the hill, something more cozy, chic, with a great fresh air and beautiful view, there're indoor and outdoor in the same times, perfect place for dating or even hanging out with friends and family. This place also serving a great food, TRUFFLE FRIES was amazing, and some of the cakes are so DELICIOUS too !! Love love love , WORTH TO TRY, since singapore always about the city and the bustling day, and here ... You will find different ambience and environment , but better to book 1st, mostly packed
5
Visited P.S. Cafe for lunch on a week day and it was packed to capacity. We had to remain seated for approximately ten mins prior to being given a table. This was justified considering we were simply walk ins as opposed to having a prior reservation. The place was beautifully designed and the ambiance was par excellence.The service was simply superb. Attentive staff, always on call to render assistance. The food was remarkable and the portions will challenge the most experienced gluttons out there :). We had the; brunch burger and truffle fries. The burger in particular was juicy and cooked to perfection...the finest ingredients accompanied the meal. The truffle fries too were great and plentiful to feed a minimum of three to four people. Visitors must also try the Irish coffee...wow! All in all an excellent experience. Highly recommended!

First visit. Very nice decoration. They have real plants as part of the deco. Only down side is you can see ants crawling at certain spots. This was what we ordered:Uncle Freddy fries - enough to feed 3-4 persons. Very nice and generous portion of fries and mushrooms. The truffle taste is strong and good. Banana butterscotch - not too sweet and rich. Love how the ice cream compliments the cake.- Tea fusion: pu er with chrysanthemum is a nice mix. Refreshing to sip it down. Did some work aft the food. Soft music in the background made it even more comfy to just chill. All in all, enjoyed my first visit

Was so excited to try this establishment after hearing so much and wish we had enjoyed the experience more, however we were disheartened for the following reasons:1. Extended wait when tables were available and staff showed lack of communication around the delay2. Overpriced relative to quality of food. 3. Despite ingredients, food preparation and presentation fell short of expectations4. Taste didn't pack a punch5. Inattentive serviceWould be happy to discuss further and give expanded feedback to general manager Thank

Very nice place, good decoration, nice atmosphere and very large portions with very good quality food. Attentive service
3
I'll just go for truffle fries. Drinks are good too. Food so-so but large portions. Dessert especially cakes are big.
5
Amazing menu, good service (waiters a little grumpy, but they are attentive), beautiful ambience and restaurant and incredible food. Little pricey but so worth it. Excellent for a date, girlie catch up, family meal - great for everything! Highly recommended.
5
I love PS Cafe, and this one is no exception. Great location, near club street and lovely atmosphere. The burger is amazing (I have it medium rare without mushrooms) and they also do takeaway!

I had brunch at PS Cafe last weekend and ordered the PS Cafe Brunch.The poached eggs and toast were stone cold and my friends's baked beans , eggs and toast was also stone cold.When we told the waiter, he did ask the chef to cook some more eggs however when they came out, the eggs were on a lettuce leaf (?) not some more toast.Given that most places in Singapore pride themselves on customer service, i would have expected the offer of some complimentary coffee with my meal but was given the full bill at the end including service charge.Not wanting to make a fuss, we paid up.As well, it was very difficult to get any of the waiter's attention as they were all huddled together by the till having a great old catch up.I decided to email PS Cafe service team customer service with my complaint.They state they get back to you in 48 hours.Nobody came back to me so I had to email again.When i received a reply it was scripted and talked about hygiene and therefore not addressing any of the issues i had.I have been a regular customer at PS Cafe for 5 years and i can safely say I won't be returning again.There are lots of other brunch places in Singapore with much better service and food and i suggest you try these places rather than here

Came here with a friend on my visit to Singapore on Friday in the evening. Food was OK, not terrific. Friend had comfort-food style chicken in a basket. I got the Miso Cod which was nice. But we didn't come here to fill our tummy (lots of mum & pap restaurants and hawker centres for those utilitarian eaters out there who love great local cuisine).We came here for a good and relaxing experience and it was such a let-down. Despite raising our hands and making eye-contact with the waiting members to have our water refilled, the members did their very best to look away or on the floor, as if we were invisible (I am 6ft3 and Blond!!). We helped ourselves to the jugs of water in the end (thank goodness no one spilled anything and tripped, would have been a health & safety debacle!!!)Same thing happened when we asked for the bill but this time our numerous attempts worked. A member came to us. When asked about the lack of attention to customers, he explained that each member serves different tables and they were understaffed. What kind of lame excuse is this? This is a restaurant not an assembly line - learn to work as team!! Under-resourced during a universally expected busy Friday evening time is just pure bad management.No more PS Cafe for me!! Plenty of places with good food along the same price range and hipness, but with better quality of customer servic

The P.S. Cafe chain was a favourite of mine when I lived there. Went back with a friend for dinner in November, and they did not disappoint. The steak sandwich is served rare with shoestring fries, and it's just luscious. I will say, however, that it can sometimes be a bit of a challenge to get the servers' attention at this particular outpost, but if you're not in a hurry, then it's great
4
Love the ambiance of this place. P.S. Cafe has been around for a while and is known for its consistency among locals. Price is on the higher end but most popular brunch places in Singapore are overpriced anyways. I loved how much they use real flowers and orchids in their interior. Was relaxing to the eyes and the soul. Food was standard: big breakfast has the usual suspects, the chicken basket is tasty but not many chicken fillets. Flat whites ok. Chocolate cake reminds me of the chocolate cake in Roald Dahl's Matilda - its that yummy but quite deadly. Recommend strongly for tourists aiming to get a peek of what expats do every weekend to chillax and have a good conversation in SGP.
4
The place is just charming and quaint. Best to make reservation before going as its usually full house. Best seats are on the second floor on the inner side. Food portions are big and definitely not local sized portions. So it's a hearty meal. They have lovely looking cakes/desserts lined up upstairs as well so you may want to look at those too if you have a sweet tooth. Nice variety of western food choices with some being fusion food. The waiters are friendly and provide good service. Please note that children are not allowed at this outlet. I like going here to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre

Went out for a business dinner to PS Cafe. It's a convenient place and fun ambiance for both professional meet ups and personal catch ups. It's quite relaxed and the staff doesn't really hurry you through the order. We got Truffle fries and the Cheese board to share. The portions are sizeable, quite daunting considering we'd ordered mains as well. The fries were really good, the cheese board could do with some improvement in terms of variety. There was too much of blue cheese and too little of the more neutral cheeses like Brie, which made it difficult for most of my colleagues to enjoy it. Mains were various: Tomato-Feta soup, Crab Cakes, Pad Thai Salad, & Aglio Olio pasta. The portions were good and most of us found the food decent. They have a good drinks menu as well. The Sangrias (Red and White) were good, so was the Singapore Sling. In all, it is a decent place, but I may not be tempted to visit again
4
I've been to this place quite a number of times. It's definitely great to be hiding out at this cafe. Great ambience and delicious food!
2
First visit. Impressed with the location, decor, and music..very slow service. Finally got our bottle of wine after we had finished our mains..Beef cheek suculent. Gado Gado....chat potatoes were almost raw....spoilt what could have a good salad. Not impressed.
4
From busy office workers to tourists like me... It's a great place to chill out. Although i must say tables are too close to each other so there is no privacy for gossips ane what have yous.. Hahahha
5
Probably the best burger we have ever eaten! A really pretty restaurant with great food and a decent wine list!
4
Had a nice dinner here and enjoyed the food here at Ann Siang Hill. Quiet location. good quality but a little on the pricey side.
4
I came here with my partner following a friends recommendation.We had a Duck Breast special and the Spicy King Prawn Aglio Olio. The food was well cooked, full of flavour and the portion size was excellent.Cocktails are reasonably priced (for Singapore) and tasty. The service was friendly and swift.An all-round winner
4
We have eaten here several times in the past few months, for Sunday brunches (interestingly different menu choices with great cocktails), light lunches (fresh, tasty salads) and dinners, and have always been impressed. The food is of consistently high quality, the portions are generous and the service is good, although can be a little slow when the restaurant is full. The ambience is welcoming and feels a little European - big vases of flowers and greenery in the restaurant, and its narrow 3 storey arrangement set in the greenery at the top of Ann Siang Hill, make it a quieter option than many other restaurants in the immediate vicinity. On our recent visit a week ago we had a fabulous steak sandwich and the special of pan fried duck breasts on a lentil cassoulet - both delicious. No visit to the PS Cafe is complete without their shoestring truffle fries, which must be the best fries in town, and it's hard to escape without trying one of their wonderful desserts or cakes! Sticky date pudding never fails to hit the markâ€¦Thoroughly recommended, and we will continue to return for its predictable high quality and atmosphere
3
We tried to go for a special family meal with two well-behaved and presentable teenagers/Tweens. It was a Tuesday evening and not busy, plenty of space. They kept us waiting 10 minutes, and then announced that they would not allow in the children... Most unimpressed at lack of flexibility, so they have lost our custom in future
4
Went three times to this place, first for dating, second for birthday celebration, third just friend gathering. It was a great dating place for my boyfriend and me, great atmosphere for dine in and wide range of food selection even with the special meal of the day. You should try their dessert on the menu, I personally love the sticky date pudding because I always got strong sweet tooth
4
A very calm place located in the popular Dempsey Hill area. This restaurant has a very nice ambiance with gardens in the front with inside being equally good. I've been here a few times with my friends and always prefer to take seats outside facing the lawns as it gives a wonderful feeling looking at the lush green view away from the tall buildings and so called skyline of Singapore. The service here is not bad but the food is a bit pricey as compared to similar restaurants but its alright I'll forget about it for the ambiance. Nice place to have your first few date meets where you could have an uninterrupted conversation to remember for life. Your partner is definitely gonna love you for this place. Happy living
4
Visited here last month for a Sunday coffee and had to try their amazing cakes! Quiet location on Ann Siang Hill makes it a great place to while away an afternoon reading the papers and chatting. Service was pretty decent by Singapore standards.
4
Found an archway leading to a rising path which looked interesting. At the top this delightful cafe. Good service; a variety of teas and a huge slice of cake made for a very enjoyable stop.
5
Love their truffle fries, which I believe are refillable on certain day/time. They make good cocktails. Desserts are wonderfully large & good too.
5
Great food in a very tastefully decorated restaurant. Love the fish, pesto pasta, mushrooms soup, sticky date pudding and delicious coffee!! Been there many times and it's always good!
4
I had Dinner at PS Cafe with my friends located at Ann Siang Hill.We totally loved the place, environment and of course the food!Felt like the portion of Truffle Fries are smaller than other PS cafes' Truffle Fries, but it is still the best fries in Singapore! Highly Recommende
4
The flower arrangement will be what I will remember of this place. Beautiful. I hear it's done by the staff, and it looks perfect, perfectly done by a professional.Food was great, drinks were well executed.I like the place and the terrace where you can smoke on second level:)
4
Very pretty interiors although food was a bit of a mixed bag, few dishes were great but others were just ok. Still a great spot for brunch and I would definitely go back. If I could change on thing it would be the weird choice of music (classical) which didn't seem to match the crowd and made it feel unnecessarily formal
4
Realy nice place great atmosphere...loads of choices on the menu for veggies I chose the Green Goddess which was a pasta dish although the portion was very large it really wasn't that good too greasy and lacked seasoning....the service was good and they found us a table although they were extremly busy...my friends had meat dishes and two out of three were pleased but my husbands lunch was very greasy and he left it....the waiter never asked why he hadn't eaten it I think if someone leaves the majority of food on the plate its a hint they didn't enjoy it....it's worth staff asking why....would try it again next time we in Singapore...as many of our friends love it there..
2
I had high hopes for this place ! But once again service was terrible ! Food arrived at different times and yet again service was given without a smile - one thing Singapore should improve is adapting western table manners to western restaurants ! Food shops come together and don't bring the food 5 minutes after ordering , let people sit down , enjoy their wine and ambience then bring the food ! The food was pretty average unfortunately so this put together with the bad service resulted in me not planning to go back Ca
3
Nice location in an old building with great atmosphere, first time here with friends who are regulars and overall would rate as above average.Menu is interesting, lots of breakfast and brunch items along with specials which are the real drawer for expats. We all went for different options... I chose the so called Lulu's left over lasagne and it was probably just that and a tad greasy, not the best I have tasted. Fish and chips and a fish special looked pretty good for our friends but the wife was not too enamoured with her green goddess veggie option.Service was friendly and prompt and an overall leisurely experience with some very good sauvignon Blanc.Place was nicely decorated for Christmas and loved the robins in the Xmas tree... not cheap if you go for the wines but well recomended..
1
Waited 10 mins downstairs, not even greeted by a staff member. When eventually met after walking to a table ourselves, was met by an unhelpful unfriendly staff member.
Food and atmosphere looks great. Service needs to be addressed.
4
It's always a pleasure to dine at A.S.H. The selection of main courses is always satisfying and the key lime pie is must try for me.After drinks at the attic is like an escape into the Manhattan city, always chic, buzzing with energy and amazing floral arrangement. Loving it
4
I actually visited this place a few months ago and can't remember what I ate. All I remember is it was very tasty! The desserts looked good too but i was too full!! We were seated upstairs and the service was very efficient. I would go back
5
Service excellent, decor very good, but food was superb. I had the Miso Cod, and for a non fish eater (cod to me is more like meat) it was so succulent I took my time. Returned a week later just to see if that fish really was that good, and again everything as I remembered. My mate had Gado Gado for starters as usual and said this was the best ever. He had fish too and said the best. I finished off with Sticky Date and it was brilliant, much lighter and sponge like than normal. A really great night. The by the glass Voigner and Riesling both excellent too
3
Revisited this cafe last week with my partner. We didnt have a booking and were made to feel quite uncomfortable as we waited to see if they could accomodate us. Order taking was very offhand also. Overall not a patch on the quality of ood and service we eperienced 6 months ago
3
I enjoy the food and ambience at PS cafe but the service is truly dreadful. I went there on 10th November and asked downstairs if I could have a table for two. They gave me an awkward "oh, that may be difficult" look until a manager came down and said, "of course, please go upstairs" - it's like they can't be bothered with more customers.I love the crab tart and the salads and burgers. They have beautiful, quality cakes but they RUINED the chocolate cake by serving it WARM with cheap chocolate sauce and ice cream. It was just revolting, the icing melted and separated. It's a cake, not a pudding: please automatically serve a cold slice with optional ice cream...If they sort out the staff and the way they serve their food, which is good food, it will be excellent
3
Visited on a Wednesday night. Quite an enjoyable experience with what looks like a good menu and ambiance. I ordered the French onion soup and Sirloin steak (very fatty), which both were distinctly average. Price was OK but I expected more given the reviews and the setting
5
I visited PS Cafe Ann Siang Hill recently (I hadn't been for a while) and I was pleasantly surprised. The service is excellent and the ambience is very pleasant. The quality of food is excellent and the menu (although it does not change often (this not being a bad thing!) has a great choice of food. It is a charming restaurant in a wonderful location and I want to return very soon. What did strike me is the value for money - something I don't often say about good Singapore restaurants. This place is a hidden gem
4
Went there with a bunch of my friends to celebrate her birthday. We had dinner down the hill and we came here to have desserts. This place is very good for dating couples, quite romantic. One thing to note is that everyone must order something. The desserts are not bad! I would recommend you to order the Flourless orange cake, it comes with a scoop of ice cream and it taste very refreshing not too sweet and heavy
5
I've been here a few times, the building has a real colonial charm to it with a bar/cafe on the first floor entrance, restaurant/bar on 2nd level, and more seating on 3rd level. Reservations good on weekends, especially for brunch as they get full. It can be a bit difficult to find but I like the charm of that.I wouldn't opt for the truffle fries as others suggest, but that's my preference. I have had brunch here and also nice simple seafood dinner (1 main course is good if you aren't hungry). Good pastry dessert options.Really good service, I'd recommend this place if you want a nice meal with a group. Also can be somewhat romantic for a couple.Thursday nights they get very busy and the cocktails really flow for Truffle Thursdays, and they may even come through with free samples of nibbles to try
4
PS Cafe is a good relaxing lunch alternative in the CBD. Not my favorite (which is Dempsey) I would say it is OK although not cheap. I would get there early for lunch as I've had times where service has been very slow.
5
Cocktails at $15 free sandwiches and scones! Great cakes. Roof top chilled music from international DJ's. Great sundowner , right in the city!
4
Reasonably priced for Singapore and good location close to Club Street. Always have the Miso Cod which I love and wash it down with a bottle of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, which naturally I share! Not haute cuisine but a delightful place for visitors.
4
Although finding this place is a little tricky it's lovely as you go into the entrance with a massive vase of beautiful fresh fragrant flowers. Downstairs is low lit, a French feel bar and cafe, next level more of a bistro feel for lunch/dinner and an array of fantastic cakes and top level more lounge style with an open air balcony section with views of the city. The service was excellent, some of the best I have found in Singapore so far in 5 months. Pleasant, helpful, nothing too much trouble and well presented.The food, however, unfortunately was rather disappointing, therefore I would only return for coffee/tea and cake in future to this branch of ps cafe or perhaps a brunch not lunch. My salad was ok, not fantastic, as was my friends. My other friend had the burger and had to send it back, as it smelt funny and tasted a bit strange. She swapped it for another dish. This was no trouble which we really appreciated. A lovely place to spend a couple of hours, shame the food wasn't amazing
4
I live in Singapore and love coming here. The restaurant itself is beautiful and while the service can be infuriatingly absent at times, the food makes up for that. It's walking distance from the city but it does make you feel like you are worlds away. Try the truffle chips and the deserts are worth the calories too :P We love it here
5
We have been living in SG for several months and had not yet tried any of the PS cafe locations. This was a delight for a casual, yet classy dinner. The place is tucked in the side of Ann Siang Hill Park and the views from the second floor dining room are fantastic. Decor is just the right mix of cozy, classic and trendy - the leather chairs at the table were perfectly comfortable and the table set with single red carnations gives the dark backdrop a pop of color. The food was yummy! If you have a hankering for truffle fries, you MUST go here and devour them. The drinks were generous in size and the sangria another must try. My husband had the steak sandwich - beautiful stacked presentation and tasty. I had the Caesar salad with grilled salmon. Perfect. This reminded me a bit of a bistro you would find in NYC. Service was on point as well. Go. enjoy
5
Went for a lunch last Monday with my very good friend. It was right at mid-day. When we arrived, the restaurant was quite empty. And the huge lily bouquet at the entrance smells amazing. I had lilies everywhere for my wedding, so it brought back the happy feeling. We got seated at the second floor, quite nice spot. I ordered Fish n Chips (changed the regular fries with truffle fries, YUM!) and lemongrass tea, while my friend ordered the Steak Sandwich (medium rare, with truffle fries too. SUPER YUM!). All our orders came out really fast, the waitress that served us was super polite, and she catered to all our needs excellently (too bad I can't remember her name!) The ambiance of this restaurant is really amazing. You wouldn't even remember that you're in the middle of buzzing Chinatown when you're inside. I always feel like I'm somewhere in Paris when I'm eating or drinking here. I've tried most of the desserts on my previous visits and none of them disappoint! That's why I always coming back for more. And the fact that this particular location only accept teenagers and adults is another PLUS in my book! No annoying kids or toddlers running around or screaming. Makes this place really perfect for a romantic dinner or drink (which I also experienced on previous visits).All in all, PS Cafe Ann Siang Hill is a number one favorite for me. I'm a huge fan and will always be! Keep up the amazing service and good quality
5
This branch of PS Cafe is by far our favourite. The menu is always changing and they consistently serve top quality food that is delicious. Going solo, as couples, with family, friends or business - this is the ideal restaurant for every occasion. Always a great ambience!Try the superfood salad, eggs benedict or the breakfast burger! House favourites!We prefer brunch here with friends and family, but its also ideal for a romantic date night.Close to Club Street, its an easy walk into the rest of the city.Pluses - They have a child free policy so you can relax into your weekend without worrying about a restaurant full of toddlers. If you do have children, try the Dempsey branch - it has a lot of room for the children to run and play while you enjoy a brunch on the balcony
3
There's a bit of Asian fusion going on here but the food isn't startling. Other reviews have criticised the service but it was prompt and reasonably attentive, despite being a busy lunch service. This cafe has a lovely leafy aspect and seems to find favour with large lunch groups. The food was perfectly edible but there wasn't a wow factor and it was a bit too pricey. The wines by the glass, in particular, are quite expensive
4
This place is a chain of cafes in Singapore. An expat friend took us there for a late dinner. The food was of high quality & tasted amazing. We both ordered pasta dishes with a bit of an asian twist. I went back for lunch today but the service was really lacking. They were busy with the office crowd & seemed a bit flustered by walk ins. I had soup & a sandwich. Again great quality and was nice to have 'western' food for a change. At $28 however for lunch it was not worth it due to lack of service & 20 min wait for food. Quality food but be prepared to pay additional. If
4
The location is superb, with trees around. Cakes are quite nice but coffee just so so. A nice place to spend afternoon with friends or with a book.
5
The best coffee in Singapore and always serves great food. Highly recommended. Very good service. Good for brunch, lunch and dinner.
5
Went for Farher's Day brunch. Great surroundings and environment. Good service and staff. Great food and quality.
Highly recommended. And a very sure card...
5
We usually go there at least once a month either for brunch or dinner. It's one of our favourites. Nice ambience. Good food. Personally, I prefer this Ann Siang Hill branch than others (less crowded).
5
From the food, staff, interiors and did I mention food? I was happy I got lost and ended up dining here. Best place! You've got to try once, or twice. I know I'd definitely keep coming back if possible!
4
Great restaurant atmosphere with nice greeneries right outside the restaurant. It's a chill place to hangout with friends or family. I tried their brunch menu, it's awesome! The portion is pretty large for me. So, if you would like to tryout their desserts or cake, probably you shall share your main course with a friend.This restaurant is pretty pack. So be prepared to wait in queue patiently :
5
We went here this morning for brunch and I felt compelled to write a quick review. The fruit platter I had was amazing. and eggs benedict pretty darn good also. Its a beautiful little place. The ample newspapers and magazines available really sold this place to me and we would happily spend a long morning here passing the time while catching up on current affairs
4
A few good local friends took me there. Didn't know what to expect was but was quickly impressed by the design and layout. The food was also wonderful: the lasagne was perfect, and the fries and calamari distinctively delightful. Will definitely return when I'm out to impress people ;
4
I just came back from a trip to Singapore and had my last lunch here. It was a really nice experience. I loved the look and feel of the place. Interiors play a huge part in my enjoyment of my meals and I must say PS Cafe didn't disappoint. The food was also wonderful (and definitely good for sharing). My friends and I shared a huge platter of their Truffle Fries (sin on a plate!) and I had Lulu's Leftover Lasagna as suggested by my friend. The lasagna was definitely unique and it did seem like they threw everything from last night's dinner in there (in a good way). Oh and one other thing, it is in a really nice location (Ang Siang Park)- very green and quite removed from the hustle bustle of the main street. I will definitely be back to try more items on the menu on my next Singapore trip
5
We ventured here after walking a few miles around china town and the shops for brunch.Lovely grand looking place with peaceful background music setting the ambiance waiting for our table. The food was delicious, i ordered the bacon with poached eggs and green pesto mushrooms with a large slice of toasted bread.The drinks were water with fresh fruit mixed in and some of us had ginger beer also,no complaints from my friends about anything only compliments.Staff were friendly and attentive.All in all, a nice experience and would come back if ever in Singapor
5
I had fish and chips for lunch. The fish was very good. The fries were thin and perfect. They did NOT have any side vegetables which was a disappointment.
3
Had our dinner last night at PS Cafe (Ann Siang Hill).this is our 2nd time that we visit the ps cafe ann siang. sad that there food is not appreciable. no improvement at all.but we still like the drinks service and ambiance.
5
A drink at the rooftop terrace surrounded by the soaring Singapore skyline, don't mind if I do!
Very stylish place tucked behind another generic karaoke bar. Quite the find.
4
Set in a three storey shop house the ambience and decor is really lovely. Takes you back in time. We were initially seated on the third floor but moved to the second as third was a little dark. Food is of a high standard. I was however a little disappointed that the menu  Is too similar to those offered at the group's other restaurants. Prices are reasonable for the quality. Good selection if wines at decent prices. Definitely worth a visit. Note no children are allowed. Only teenagers and adults.
5
We had drinks late at night on the rooftop. What a quiet place in a busy city, what a good coktails, good music, good atmosphere! A perfect end of a busy day . We did not have food here but no doubt it will be great as well
3
As you walk in you don't get that personal service feel (handed a blue ticket to take upstairs) - once sat down, you then realize just how noisy people are here - v loud we want everyone to hear our conversation types. The hard surfaces of the interior exacerbates the noise issues.Food was good albeit expensive(I suppose expected) S$100 for 2, breakfast and soup/salad. Service- the very pleasant asian lady serving us was excellent. Won't take Reservations for sunday lunc
4
The good was excellent! Had the crab cake, which was lovely. Tip: go for a Caipirinha Classic cocktail, it's very good. Location is great, as it's located around the corner from Club Str, where you can go out all night. Only slight critique: staff did not notice us very often. We took it slow but they didn't always see us.
5
I needed to counterbalance the TA review "worst service ever" because I was in that PS CafÃ© yesterday and I had a wonderful experience there (Sunday brunch). I especially loved the ambiance, the music (lots of classical and opera) and I found the service excellent (the 2 waiters were really nice and helpful). Probably the person who did not like it went there on a bad day; for me it was a great day :
3
This place is remarkably popular. Good selection of different types of food. I went for the Porterhouse for 2, which wasn't especially cheap at $139++ SGD. Sides cost extra when ordering from the grill menu. Decent selection of wines, several beers on tap. Great views from the rooftop out over the city. A little loud inside the restaurant for casual conversation
2
I love PS Cafe at Dempsey Hill. My friend suggested this one for a change. What a bad decision. From the moment we entered the establishment we were treated with rude arrogant attitude. When the "host" finally did get around to seating us ( the cafe wasn't full) we had to ask 3 times for a drink orders to be taken. The surly waitress finally arrived after about 15 minutes and grunted our orders back us - no eye contact and full of attitude. We both ordered the same dish and when the mains arrived you would have thought that they had run out fish. My serve was a full serve my companions was less then half of my serve was. There were plenty of staff but no service. For the high prices I expect a little courtesy and at least some service. I expressed my displeasure at the experience and the reaction was a mute couldn't care less attitude. Very Very Very disappointing. There are many other great places to eat. Give this a wide berth
5
P.S. Cafe Ann Siang Hill is perfect place for lunch, business or leisure
Very wide choice on offer
Portions are sizable
Quality and freshness always there.
Service is impecable and friendly
Right atmosphere
1
The waiters and waitresses are MUTE. They are afraid to approach your table and ask you if you need anything or take your order. The first time I went there, we waited 30 minutes for the servers to come take our order and the pathetic thing was that there were TWO waiters hovering around us NOT DOING ANYTHING! They saw us but did not approach us! When they did come, they just stood there and didn't say anything until we said, "We would like to order." Same thing happened the other day. Why aren't these people trained in customer service??? Gorgeous venue but the service is the pits. Not going back after I gave it a second chance
1
Just had our dinner at PS Cafe (Ann Siang Hill). We were seated on the 3rd floor. This place has one of the worst service we encountered.I asked for the bill yet none of the waiters responded to me. In the end I had to walk up to a waiter to ask for it. I waited another 10 mins before walking over to the bar counter to request for my bill again.Finally I got the bill and passed my credit card to them. I waited another 5 min before I went back to the counter to check with them why they were taking so long. Only after I demanded them to settle my bill on the spot, I left to talk to the manager Mr. Carlos.Mr Carlos mentioned that he was unable to do anything about it because my bill was settled. The only remedy he could offer was to invite me to PS Cafe again but why would I?Definitely not a place I would recommend. Maybe go to the branch at Dempsey instead or till they know what service is all about
5
The atmosphere is amazing! The food is delicious and the service is wonderful. P.S. Cafe is my go to restaurant now, I just love it so much. The decor is wonderful and creates a lovely ambience. A perfect for a meal with a date, family, friends, whoever.

This place is well known amongst residents of Singapore, but not so much tourists. The wine list is extensive and expensive (as all wine is in Singapore) but the food was well prepared, well served, and delicious.We did see that some people come late in the evening and just order a drink and cakes (which are FABULOUS!) Highly recommended

BAD SERVICE from rude wait staff whom refused to pay attention to anyone, threw coasters on our table and just shuffled them around lazily, did not repeat orders while giving a 'reluctant-to-work' face. Me and another friend got bitten 3 times around our arm area by a mysterious insect. We swear it looked like a bed bug bite, extremely itchy. There was an endless train of ants on the wall beside our round bar table located at the end of level 3 near the piano. We were very uncomfortable and felt at many point we were bitten by small insects. We emailed PS Cafe management 2 times to feedback about this bad experience, however there was no reply/callback from anyone. I guess bad service comes right from the top huh

This outlet was on top of the "little hill". It is a little difficult to spot as the sign on the road is tiny and we nearly went up the service entrance! The service was ok and the food was good. I preferred the one on Harding Street. Better ambience then this one

The whole experience was marred by the appearance of a baby cockroach running across our table. We trapped the insect under a glass cup and called the waitress over to remove it. I had already finished my pasta and my partner was halfway through his meal. It was disconcerting to find cockroach running across the table at a posh place like this - very highly unacceptable.When the waitress saw the insect, she didn't seem surprise but took her time to remove the insect. She also didn't offer any apologies.By then, we were both quite unsettled.The food was ok but quite forgettable when compared to the cockroach. The PS Bolognaise that I order (forgotten the name) was not bad while the Chicken Parmigiano that my partner ordered was delicious. We wanted to try something different and called for the Coconut Bakewell Tart which took a long while to come - 30 mins. The same waitress took our order and we were wondering why it took so long when we saw the row of cakes/tarts in front of us. She also didn't bother to inform us upon taking our order.Finally the cake came - it was warm but not to our liking. The coconut taste was too strong and the texture of the cake was rough. For fans of the Key Lime Pie, I would suggest sticking to the tried and tested desserts.Upon asking for the bill, I was annoyed that at that point nothing was done to apologize or make the situation better. The waitress brought us the bill and upon seeing my annoyed face, did a half-hearted apology and said since we ordered dessert, the dessert was on the house. I wondered if there would be any service recovery had we not ordered any dessert?The food at Jamie's Italian (Vivocity) was over-rated but I would say the atmosphere and service was top-notch. Of course, a comparison cannot be made like that but with the price of the food, we would definitely go back to a place where the service was excellent instead of one where the service is poor and cockroaches run amok

After having had pleasant experiences at other PS Cafe outlets, our entire family decided to try out the one in Ann Siang Hill. We made a booking by phone/sms.The sitter/waiter at the entrance looked at my youngest 13 year old son and wanted to check his ID, as he did not believe that he was a teenager. Being 13 and not having been issued an NRIC card (my oldest son got his at 15 years old), nor did he bring along his EZ link card, he had no way to prove his age. The sitter's condescending and unhelpful manner in pointing out that their website indicated only adults and teenagers were allowed worsened the situation. Perhaps PS Cafe should put a warning on their website that if you are a young-looking teenager, bring along your passport or some form of ID to prove your age, otherwise you might be denied entry by an arrogant sitter. This encounter on 15 October left such a bad taste in our mouths, we have decided never to return to PS Cafe as they have plainly shown they do not desire our custom, and we shall tell all our friends so

I visited PS Cafe at Ann Siang Hill last Friday for lunch with a friend and two new acquaintances. My friend chose the venue and it was an excellent choice. PS Cafe at Ann Siang Hill is stylish and spacious with quite a nice outlook too, which is unusual in ChinaTown, albeit a little difficult to find the street address when one doesn't know what to look for.The upstairs dining room in PS Cafe was about 3/4 three quarters full, but still reasonably quiet and it was easy to carry on a conversation. The menu is interesting, though the serving sizes are a little too large perhaps. The wine list was OK - as I said, it was a leisurely lunch so we could indulge. Quality of the food is reasonably good.As always, desert at PS Cafe is somewhat over the top - smaller serving sizes would be better and result in less food wastage.Overall, a good experience in the heart of the city

We enjoyed a very nice brunch the other day with friends at PS Cafe. The brunch menu was reasonable with a couple of specials which were great. The wine list was excellent & varied. Will definitely visit again.

Good for a pre-dinner drink in the bar downstairs and then something to eat upstairs. Always tends to be busy and this creates a nice buzz. The food is OK, nothing to write home about. As for the service, generally quite good.

Great black sesame cocktail with a wonderful view of the city on the rooftop bar. But the café is very beautiful inside too, nice atmosphere.

PS cafÃ© is situated on Ann Siang Hill near Chinatown in Singapore. The views are amazing, you are in the middle of the old section of Singapore with a view of the sky scrappers.Cocktails are wonderful, made by Omar and Nino, who are the friendliest bar tenders you will ever meet. The food is excellent and I would really recommend it to any one
4
The view and atmosphere is fantastic, but the food is average. I like the decoration with a lot of flowers and plants, look so cozy... the one at Siang Hill is the best, i suggest if you go there at night for a drink with friends. I will back there again next time in Singapore

We booked at this restaurant 6 weeks ahead. At that time, the manager indicated she'd give us a table towards the centre of the restaurant so we'd have a good view of the whole room. Sounded good and we were looking forward to it, being the last night of our holiday. When we arrived, a different manager insisted we had no booking (despite them having confirmed it by email) and we could eat at a lounge/coffee table arrangement. No thanks! We were about to be turned away when my husband spotted our booking near the top of the list. So we were shown to a table, conveniently located near the toilets. When we expressed disatisfaction with this, we were advised all the tables in our promised area were made up for groups. We should have left then. Soon after, we noticed they'd split one of these group tables to accommodate another twosome who clearly knew the waiters and wouldn't accept the other table close to the toilets. .As far as the food was concerned, the entree of soup was good, but the mains - crab tart and beef pie - were very average. The crab tart was dry and the beef pie was swimming in liquid to the extent it was very difficult to eat. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, waiters - including the 'head waiter' -passed our table many times before our plates were removed.We hadn't planned on leaving a tip. However they get around this nicely by adding 10% service charge to the bill. This restaurant has the gall to advise in their booking confirmation email that any guests 15minutes or more late risk losing their booking and being charged a penalty to their credit card. I wouldn't object to this normally but consider it pretty arrogant for a restaurant that treats customers so badly.High prices and poor service. With so many restaurants in this area, you shouldn't waste your time on this one

Love the chain of PS cafe - but the location of Ann Siang Hill is one of my favourites. The food is consistently good and reasonably priced. There is a small roof top bar that is very quiet and romantic - the Mojito is one of the best in town

Visited on a weekday night and had a great dessert recommendation from Julie (sticky date pudding) as my preferred dessert which is the banana butterscotch was an eighty-six. My best bud enjoyed his lemon pudding thoroughly. Serving size for both items are not pretentious and the hot mocha that I had, left a good after taste before asking for the bill.Both of us were impressed with Julie's friendly and honest disposition and her service was impeccable yet not intrusive. Worth the try guys. And I'll be back for my banana butterscotch

This place is always talked about as one of the best brunch places in Singapore, so we decided to pay not just one but two visits to see what the hype was about. We've been twice because on the first occasion we thought the kitchen was having an off-day, but our experience on the first visit appears to be the standard.Please note: this place isn't cheap or even mid-range - it's positioning itself in the upper-end of food places in Singapore in terms of pricing. For two people we spent $125 SGD for two mains, one side dish, coffee and soft drinks.On each visit we ordered eggs benedict with salmon, and fish and chips. What a disappointment. The egg's benedict is bland - with tiny eggs and completely tasteless and measly portions of hollandaise. The fish and chips were poor - with badly cooked fish and the worst truffle fries we've tasted in a long time - the oil was old and the fries over-cooked.The only positive point was the service - which is engaging and friendly - and the coffee and drinks.The 'no reservation' policy is pretentious and I'm amazed how popular this place is in a Country so sensitive to price. Perhaps, during brunch, the free-flow champagne detracts attention from the food, but I'd summarise PS Cafe as an over-priced and conceited chain that lacks any real culinary substance

It's a good place to enjoy fine dining with friends or business partners. Every main course & dessert always look attractive, taste delicious & fresh. Big portion - can easily share a dish between 2 people. Don't go there if you are on diet :) Staff are friendly & helpful with good advises, although kitchen seems to be slow in serving. For lunch, suggest you allocate at least 2-3hr, to fully enjoy the main course & desserts. It's mostly full, so reservation is recommended, and try to book a table on the cosy 2nd or 3rd floor. Note that the place can be a little noisy at peak hour after everyone has a drink or two. Like many others said, be prepared to pay for a wonderful meal. It's not a daily affair but most suitable for special moments or events

Great brunch spot. Not cheap though. Good cocktails and the food is not just your standard fare. Have been several times, it is always a nice treat. Good spot to go with friends or for a romantic brunch date.

Average food, slow service and high prices???? Have been there twice and was disappointed both times.
4
We came for brunch and its a nice, stylish yet relaxed spot with a good western menu with good quality ingredients and a couple of inventive options.We also did the $85 free-flow of moet from 11.30-3.30 (cheaper wines and sparkling available on free-flow at $55).Its not so easy to find - at the top of Ann Siang Rd there is a hill with pedestrian steps - walk up it (not far up!)

Was at PS Café at Ann Siang Hill to celebrate a birthday of a friend! It is housed in an old conserved shophouse but hidden away from view and right behind another shophouse. Ambience is so so, food was in between average and good but the prices were pretty high compared to better restaurants! Now I know why my friend order the hamburger. I ate the codfish and paid the price! Hahaha

I visited PS Cafe during my stay in Singapore. First with friends who are living in Singapore and visit here often. Grat wine list and tasty food. We sat upstairs and it was perfect for our catchup and the waiters were just attentive enough. I was in Singapore for a conference on Sentosa Island (awful by the way) and managed to escape and return with a work colleague where we had another enjoyable meal. I have read the comments about service but it was spot on for us

Went here last night a few friends from Europe after a recommendation. I want to start by saying I feel bad only giving this place 3 out of 5 however I have solid reasons for this rating. Let's start with the food.The food overall was great, between the three of us we got a portion of Calamari starter, one Steak Sandwich and two of the White Wine Roasted Whole Chickens. For desert we got a piece of the double black out chocolate cake. We specifically asked for the Calamari to be served first but unfortunately it didn’t come until 10 minutes after our mains, first mistake of the evening. I didn't try the steak sandwich but the Chicken was fantastic both in taste and portion. We ordered the creamy spinach and mashed potato sides but unfortunately the mashed potato on both dishes was stone cold, second mistake. The Calamari came with a Lemon Mayo dressing which was otherworldly excellent.The double black out chocolate cake desert was excellent, moist and rich. It was possible the largest serving of chocolate cake I've ever seen - easily enough for three people.Now let’s go onto the service. Unfortunately and I'm using a lot of empathy in this review the service was poor at best. The Chocolate Cake alone took almost 20 minutes to come even though it was sitting in a display cabinet one flight of stairs below us. When we chased the waitresses they had clearly forgotten our order and gave us the cake free of charge which was a good gesture. Now let's discuss the setting and ambience of this place. With an almost Jazz club noir ambience, very comfortable chairs and mood lighting this place would make a great date night location. The lighting however was so moody we could hardly see our hands in front of our face, when we asked the service team for another light they acknowledged our request but unfortunately forgot and the second light never came. In the group there was an Irishman and an Englishman, both used to year round cold. The air conditioning was too powerful and within 15 minutes of sitting we were freezing cold - good job I brought a jacket! Finally price, for three mains a start and two soda's (minus the free of charge cake) the bill came to 160 Singapore Dollars which is not cheap for Singapore but at the same not outrageous either. In my opinion a fair price to pay for the quality of food but not for the quality of service.When you walk into this restaurant it gives you the overwhelming feeling of quality so expectations were high within 10 seconds of entering. I would definitely eat here again but maybe ask for a table of the 2nd floor where it's better lit and seemed a little warmer or try a different outlet

My boyfriend took me here and we had a great meal. Wine was delicious, food was a bit different but there was enough choice to cater for all sorts of tastes and the deserts were amazing! I think it was quite pricey but was a really nice treat. We didn't go to the roof terrace but it seemed quite busy so could be nice to have after meal cocktails too

PS Cafe Ann Siang Hill should have it all - a great building in a heritage area with gorgeous decor and a strong black and white aesthetic. The premises are spacious with high ceilings and there is plenty of parking nearby in the URA centre. The menu is very similar, if not identical, to the Dempsey Hill branch, where I have eaten many times. The wine list is high quality and we enjoyed an excellent Zinfandel with the meal (excellent and Zanfandel being words not usually associated in the same sentence). However, the execution of the food at Ann Siang Hill was somewhat lacklustre. My main course was a chicken escalope wrapped in parma ham with a prawn and bed of gnocchi and tomato sauce. The chicken was sadly flavourless whilst the gnocchi were slightly overcooked / soggy and few in number. The sprig of thyme which accompanied the meal provided the most flavour. The lamb my colleagues had was tender and succulent but lacked much in the way of supporting dishes. PS Cafe is famed for its generous portions and tasty flavours and I have to say my meal was a disappointment, especially at the price point. The slab of carrot cake for dessert was huge, but a little dry on the outside. The management should seriously look at half portions of their massive cakes and offering some form of fruit platter.The staff were attentive and the service good but I think the chef needs to focus on execution and flavour in the specials, as my special was anything but special. There's a great ambiance at the place, but restaurants are ultimately about the food as much as the surroundings and more work is required here

Great restaurant, a decent menu with home-style food, a good wine list and good service, nice ambience. Nothing to fault. I ordered the Laksa pesto which was delicious. The hamburgers were thick and juicy and the lasagne tasty. Lots of comfort food. Also the truffle fries with parmesan - yum! Also an efficient online table booking system

This cafe is well located in the Chinatown area, and it serves modern food, including grills at a hefty price. It has a great buzz but we found the service very slow. The waggu burger I had was good but not wonderful as it was cold as were the accompanying fries. My wife had a chicken wrapped in prosciutto special...it was dry, overcooked, and not edible. My friends both had average meals, and a side of squid was rubber like. This is a pity as the place itself has promise. Having 10% service included in the bill should be banned! All in all disappointing
4
It is a nice and quiet place for lover and friends. The food also taste good. Just the price a bit more expensive than you expected. I like to try their different type of cakes. I will visit the place again in future.
5
posh environment with a business crowd, but a little overpriced for what i expected. food was good but wasn't worth the high price. glad to have experienced it, but i wouldn't return. there are many dining options in singapore with similar feel.

We thought the name was interesting so we went inside.What a lovely place.PS Cafe serves mainly western dishes Prices range from $25-$40 for a main course whilst desserts are mostly between $10-$15. Prices are not exactly cheap, I guess you are paying for the ambience.It seems a quite popular for lunch. We ordered the truffle fries. Very nice and crispy and good seasoning.Truffle is very popular to use these days.The Triple Cheese Penne is like a classy version of the good ol' mac & cheese. A refreshingly orange and garden green salad on the side help balance of the cheese.Then we had chocolate fudge. Recommended by the waiter.It was too thick for us. And we couldn't finish the cake by the two of us.Overall the experience was nice. The food was not outstanding and memorable. But the place was indeed lovely

I've frequented this corner spot in Ann Siang Hill a couple of times. Service is good and usually attentive irrespective of the time of day.The location is trendy but not overcrowded and the Christmas decor when I was there in Dec, was really rather special so I would imagine this touch would permeate any celebration. Food is good , wines varied and reasonably-priced and ambience is bistro-like. Would I recommend it to visitors to Singapore? Very definitely for a laid-back lunch or extended dinner.

Never come again if the waiter named Marvin Lester hasn't gotten fired. I went to the restaurant yesterday with friends and met this waiter at the host desk; unwilling to serve, keep saying no tables, and try to keep us out of checking upstairs. We went upstairs finally and found that it was empty so we get the table. Later on i found out that this guy is a supervisor of that day. While other waiters are joyful and nice, we don't expect this vile behavior and unacceptable manner from a manager position like this guy. Disappointed. But nice food by the way, will come back again but another branc

A unique place which is the only branch which admits Adults & Teenagers only. No kids . So its something different not having any kids wailing or running around. I guess thats why it is quite popular. You need to make a reservation just in case as it can be quite packed at times. We went at 1200noon and by 1230 it was quite full.Try the PS Chicken Basket. Unique taste. But the best was the huge double Choc Cake. Be warned - you need min 3 persons to finish this. Both of us took a while to finish 3/4 of it.A place not to be missed
5
Come here for if you want to indulge in great food. Service is great and ambience fantastic. I like the look and feel of the restaurant and how they wrote the specials on the glass wall. The no child policy is great! Certainly a great place if you want to impress a date or celebrating that special occassion

It takes 20 minutes from Toa Payoh. You can reach the place only by taxi or car. It costs around S$15. The taxi driver maybe not really know about the place, because it's kinda hidden at downhill. U can search the directions or tell the taxi driver the right address. dempsey hill was a comfortable place to hangout. there's a lot of cafe near the ps cafe, but I recommend this cafe better than anything else. The food was awesome, the staffs was very friendly and have a good smile!! the view was just perfect coz t's rained. So romantic places to hangout.. very high recommended. The price for the food and beverages was kindahigh, but it's pkay. I spent around S$70 for the turkey, bacon-thing food, with 2 beverages and one fried potatoes,

We found this bar trawling the streets of Chinatown one afternoon. A taxi driver informed us this area is mainly full of ex-pats, which may explain the higher prices. But our food was extremely good and the staff were friendly. I recommend the crab tart and will definitely return. Don't miss it as its tucked in the corrner of Ann Sian Road not far from Club Street

We arrived at the restaurant at precisely the time it opened at 6:30 pm. It was a Sunday evening and empty. And it would probably have taken at least an hour until other patrons arrived. Nevertheless, the staff would not allow us to enter the restaurant. Why? Because we had a baby fast asleep in a stroller with a cover over him. Our 9 month old was out for the night. The staff advised they had a no children policy at that outlet. I told the guy to use a little common sense. The place was empty. We'd be out before most of their patrons arrived and the baby was fast asleep. He wouldn't however and told us we couldn't eat there because we had a baby with us. He said we could eat at their other outlets which wasn't particularly helpful since they were at least a 20 minute drive away. Thanks very much for that advice!! We left famished and having to find somewhere else to eat. That was probably a good thing however because a friend recently had the runs after eating at P.S. Cafe at Ann Sian Hill and I did think I was taking a bit of a risk wanting to try the place but after walking around this picturesque part of Singapore, we were starving and the menu looked good. So in short, maybe the food is good there. Maybe the food is lousy. I don't know. I didn't get a chance to find out. But who wants to support a restaurant where not only do they have a discriminatory policy against children which in many countries would be illegal, but they completely lack common sense. Go somewhere else and avoid their other branches as well until they lift their anti-children policy on the Ann Sian Hill outlet
