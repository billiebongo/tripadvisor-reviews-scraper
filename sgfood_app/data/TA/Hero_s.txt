Nice spacious environment, cheap beer during happy hour, with a trivia night every week, a place to go check out if you are in the CBD for drinks

drink prices here are nett, with no additional gst / tax. ambiance was pretty chill, with indoor and outdoor seating. we sat outdoors, and you can just soak in the friday CBD atmosphere here.

Great bar in boat quay.
Really awesome staff, always on hand and quick with the drinks.
The only place with live music in the area.
They also play sport every day.
A winner all round.

Have been here with bunch of friends and it's quite spacious. If you are interested in sports, you can get together and watch games on big screen. Beer price is more or lase same (rather high) as other paces around. Bar food is good, nothing stellar. Nice and helpful staff

This was the first time we’ve been to Hero’s. We didn’t know what to expect but heard about it from some friends. The most amazing thing is the awesome band, Rockweller, we would definitely go back just to see them.Drinks are expensive but ok. E.g. 2 single Malts on the rocks and 1 Jack Daniels with ginger ale costs SGD60.Great atmosphere, very happening crowd

I went there for lunch during a weekday. It has a nice decor with a bar and large seating space. Friendly staff and a short menu - both enable to make up our mind quickly!The food (veg. Biriyani) wasn’t great though. Seems that they share kitchen and Chef with the next door Indian restaurant. The vegetables weren’t cooked well and the side dish which was suppose to be a curry was more like cooked tomato sauce. There were four small pieces of naan which were quite good.Three other things which went right - right portions for lunch, non greasy and the price ($10).Try at your own risk - may be some of the other dishes on the menu are not that bad

Hero´s contracted one great live band. The prices are reasonable for Singapore and Clarke Quay. The atmosphere in Heros is always relaxed. Come as you are - no dress code. The later the night, the better the party. The dancing floor fills every day. The people are usually a good mix of young backpackers and elderly party people. I consider this the best dancing bar with live music in SG

I visited Hero's a couple of weeks ago with some clients as we were having an all day meeting a few doors down.Whilst the venue has not been open for lunch for a long period, we found the lunches tasty and the service from Lincoln was excellent.The lunchtime menu was excellent value at $10 a head, and portions were just right

Had a couple of drinks here sitting outside. The street is very busy with traffic and cars parked. It is in quite a shady area with lots of massage parlours and there was a police presence although at no time did we feel unsafe

I had a few big nights out that have ended here. Good for a beer n a chat n too listen to live cover bands.

Visited on a Friday night with a friend. One of her friends was playing in the "warm-up band" and I joined her and her group of friends. Bar was not over crowded and was not hard to order drinks. Big enough crowd that it was fun but not so much that you could not move. The beer was cold and tasted fresh and the pours of whiskey were not scanty.Both bands were good. The house band was very good, and the warm-up band was also quite good considering they do not always play together. The sound system was better than average and you could actually hear the instruments and the singers well. Usually places like this have muddier sound but not here. Bands both played cover songs and had male and female singers so could do a wide variety of songs well.Small dance floor in front of the band. Good mixed crowd of expats and locals.Only real complaint was that the serving crew was too quick in clearing drinks and three times is a row they cleared my friend's whiskey before she was finished it. When I mentioned it to the bartender, he replaced one of the drinks and said to put the cardboard coaster over the top to let the serving staff know the drink is not done. Was quite good customer service, immediately acted to make good the issue and gave good advice.Would certainly visit it again

We came across this bar while wandering down circular road during Saint Patrick's day, and I must say it's a really cool bar. The first thing that caught our attention was the helpful attitude of the staff. Even though it was a crazy busy night, that staff went out of their way to find a couple of chairs for my wife and I. The live bands were great and they played a lot of cover songs that everyone in the bar knew. Food was good and the portion sizes were genrous. It's walking distance to a couple of MRT stations, which is always a bonus. Well worth a visit

Great comedy every Tuesday with the wonderful Umar Rana at the helm of Comedy Masala. Monthly shows too with Mad About Comedy. Great drinks deals, food and a live band every night too - the best venue on Circular Road. I particularly like the tables with their own beer taps. Awesome

Amazing live music venue. Open 7 days a week, and serving awesome food/drinks and of course live music! You can also catch ALL sporting events at the multiple live screens (at least 6!). Open till late every night. Also check out the hugely successful weekly stand-up comedy show - Comedy Masala

Located on side road at Boat Quay this venue was one of our favourite bars on recent visit to Singapore.I contacted the Manager (Victoria) in advance to check information on sporting events being televised and entertainment information and she couldn't have been more helpful in her response, so refreshing to receive such outstanding customer service. The house band were very entertaining playing a wide range of commercial songs, drinks were good with lots of drink promotions available, the bar had a real feel good vibe to it.Victoria introduced herself on our visit just to add to the personal customer service we received, highly recommended.

Met up with a group of friends for drinks and a live show at Hero's. Great place! Ample drinks menu and good food options, too. Good outdoor and indoor seating - depending upon what you want. Worth going again for sure.

A group of us visited at short notice and easily got a table. The drinks were expensive as you would expect but the service was good. The live music was varied and better when playing rock n roll rather than hits from the 80's....It had a nice vibe and I would say it is good for a visit later in the evening for a last beer or tw
