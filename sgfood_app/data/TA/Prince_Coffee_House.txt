Apart from the normal coffee house set meals, I like the Chicken Pie & Yam cake, which I never fail to pack home, or pack as gifts to in-laws or friends.

We were looking around where to have our dinner walking along the streets opposite Patk Royale Hotel in Beach Road Singapore. Too many cafe and restaurants to choose. We happened to walk pass the Prince Coffee House which claims to be authentic Hainanese food since 1970s. Many types of grills, pork chops, chicken chops, steaks, pies, Chinese food as well. I had the pork xhops and my wife had grilled kurau fish. Not too bad but not that extra ordinary. The boss showed us his famous yam cake and apple pie which are served only for breakfast

This coffee house is near to the yoga studio which I attended. A good place for casual gatherings as their food is unpretentious and delicious. I like the chicken horfun, fu yong prawns, fried bean sprouts with salted fish and chicken pie. The boss is very hospitable and he always serves us complimentary desserts after our meal. Worth a visit if you are around Beach Road

I was regular visitor here as i was living right across the street in serviced apartment. Great food, very cheap and lovely owner Uncle Jimmy. Family run business with loving care of their customers. Try Singapore fried noodled with Tiger beer = 15SGD dinner which is great

I love the restaurant's atmosphere. Pictures that the owner took with the actors and actresses during the 70s were used to decorate the restaurants. The food was great and so was the variety. I had the opportunity to speak with owner and found out that the yam cake and chicken pies are very popular.

Chinese people from Hainan Island came south to settle in parts of Malaya and Singapore in late 1880s and early 1900s. Most found employments as cooks for europeans, hence trained to cook western food but with a twist. Location : At the end of Haji Lane near to Beach Road, about three shops away.Try their sumptuous Oxtail stew, fried koey teow (flat rice noodle) with beef, pork chops with rice, set lunches..... I was given homemade jackfruit ice cream with my dinner one night. Very packed during lunch, go early or after lunch crowd.Try the chicken pie, can ask to heat up if take away. One of the best Hainanese cooking I have tried.A favorite among Taiwanese film stars in the 70-80s. There are many reviews by Singaporean food bloggers
