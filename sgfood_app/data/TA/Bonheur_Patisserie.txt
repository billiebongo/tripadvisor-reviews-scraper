went to their stall at raffles city; very good macaroons with a wide range of choices; comes in a nice box too if you need to give as a gift;

Delicious macaroons as a dessert after having a heavy meal. Get the 10pcs box and get 10% off. Never regret getting a box as the macaroons were not too sweet but just nice. And paired very well with teas and coffee

Not cheap but still worth it for the quality and excellent flavours. We love macaroons and try them wherever we can. These were the best in any country. Of the 6 or so flavours I tried, all were very good.

This is one of my must-buys whenever I am in PasarBella. I find their macarons more delicious than any other I've tasted, including the famous Laduree'. Their size is definitely larger, too.They also have character macarons from time-to-time that are perfect for children's parties or giveaways.The people behind the counter are also very courteous and accommodating. Even offering to store your purchases of you still have some errands to do
