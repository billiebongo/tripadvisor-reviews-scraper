It's a good place to gather with friends or family for valuable BBQ meal. Non-airconditioned restaurant, however, it's not very hot too with it's outdoor space for BBQ-ing. There are fans on the pillars which fan off the heat. The serving is fast with friendly & patient uncle came with our orders after orders. The surrounding is clean, the utensils for BBQ are clean too. Happy to have tried there 1st time. Pleasant dinner with friends, talking & laughing. Will be back again recommending to other friends

This is one of my favourite mookata places in Singapore. Although the range is a bit limited, it is very affordable for a buffet. More recently, they introduced a fondue-like cheese sauce for dipping, in addition to the chilli sauce. Both are very good. Thai Milk Tea is also available free-flow, in additional to the usual soft drinks. Do try to come early, especially on weekends, or you would have to be prepared to wait for a table

This was my first Mookata experience and I'd rate it 3.5 going on to 4 actually. I thought the variety could be expanded although to their credit, they did have several strong offerings like the garlic chicken, scallops & dory fish fillets. If you're a chilli lover, you'll love their chilli sauce. Thai Milk tea (SGD2.50/cup) was good too. Service staff were nice & warm. Also, to our utter dismay, despite this being a buffet, my friends and I were restricted to 1 order of crayfish per pax

Came here for a film fest movie and dropped by for a quick dinner. Sat down and within 1 minute, the platter of cold/raw ingredients was placed in front of us. We asked why no need to order, and "standard platter" was the answer. Hilarious. Average looking food - some chicken, pork, liver, fish balls, fake crab sticks and vegetables. The steamboat was a steam and grill combo. The taste was ok, and the whole experience was just rustic. Are there better steamboats in Singapore and Thailand? Probably most of them ar

Have tried 3 outlets of Mookata and this is the best. Known to be the original Thai Mookata.Price- $39/- steamboat set for 2-3 pax. Drinks pricing are very reasonable costing about $1.50 for thai ice tea and sodas.Ambience - air conditioned hawker style seatingService - Fast response from the staff. Mainly service staff are thai people.Food - seasoning is almost perfect, good for singaporean where it's not too salty and spicy. Those who loved thai food have to try this.Highlights - Prawns have been de-shell for you :) Waiting - Need to wait 15-20mins during peak hours.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. After trying this outlet, will never go for other outlets known as Mookata
