Loved the food and the efficient service. A decent menu and easy to get to. Staff were pleasant. Nice clean surroundings.

located in the middle of China town. Very authentic oriental design restuarant with vast choice of Cantonese Dim Sum.
The mini egg tart is a.must try.here.
The only set back is the mildew smell, probably the furniture is too old
5
A friend in Singapore recommended this place and I wasn’t disappointed. They kept bringing round dim sum on trolleys and it was very reasonably priced, spacious and air conditioned. Definitely worth the short wait to get in.

Great service unfortunately matched with bad dim sum. Cold roast, soft spring roll skins, badly done up dumpling soup etc doesn’t justify the 30% higher price there. De Bao Dim Sum at the adjacent street is so much better.
4
The food was served very promptly. Knowing that we came in even number and dim sum are served in odd number. Service crew took the initiative to cut it for us.
4
The Tim sum is nice and hot when served but the service is not as good cause our tea hv to ask a few time then they add water
5
We happened to dine here as Tak Po is closed down, and we enjoyed our lunch a lot. During CNY there are many ppl doing “lo hei” thus the restaurant is quite noisy. This is how new year supposed to be . Dim sum was serviced with trolleys, they approach the table very frequently and friendly enough to show and explain to us. You can see the restaurant signage from far. However it’s on the second floor thus it may be a bit tricky to find the entrance. I enjoyed the squid dumpling (I can’t remember the name , it’s black color dumpling ) the most You can inform the staff to remove the peanuts when it’s serviced at the beginning if you don’t need it.

Terrible service. Not the impressive Yum Cha I remembered. We had not enough chairs for our group of 6, no space because the other table had their bags on a chair right next to our table, unable to move back because the tea/cutlery station was next to us. When we told the service staff, she basically gave us zero solutions. Move tables? Nope. Shift ours back? Nope. Tell the other group to move their bags? Nope, she actually said, “what do you want me to do?”. I legit just told you what to do!As if the experience isn’t bad enough, 2 of our ordered items wasn’t keyed in. Felt like I was boiling so much throughout the entire meal I was going to get indigestion. Why am I paying service charge?? I might as well go to a coffee shop jfc. Save yourself the headache and monies and go to Swee Choon instead. This place is going downhill.

We ate here as a part of a tour, so had a set menu, which may explain our rating. Other diners appeared to be enjoying their food more than we did. The set menu had the usual suspects: a soup, a chicken with sauce dish, a fish with vegies and sauce, pork fried rice, a broccoli dish, and a mango pudding for dessert. The food was not bad, just uninspired, as was the service. I would hope that one could do better in Chinatown in Singapore
4
We were all craving a good dim sum lunch and found Yum Cha by pure chance. They had a good selection of dim sum for lunch and we enjoyed all of them. The main room is pleasant and has a really good atmosphere and the fact that it is on the 1st floor makes it calmer than other places in Chinatown
5
Unpretentious restaurant settings
Excellent menu with great choice of Dim Sum
Roast duck is sublime
Very fresh ingredients
Good service
Reasonable

Cashier for that day was unfriendly.We arrived with no staff at the entrance and I went to the counter to ask for a table and she totally ignored me! And when we’re paying the bill,she was totally arrogant!Blessings were the serving staff were great!!!

I went here after reading the mainly good reviews on TA. I found this place to offer very poor value for money and the dim sums themselves lacked flavour with very small portion sizes and fillings. I mean, I’ve had better dim sum all the way in the U.K. If this place is meant to be one of the better dim sum places in Singapore then I’m afraid you are better of choosing a different cuisine. I spent $20 on three dim sums and a soft drink for myself. Whilst it may seem like good value compared to the U.K., believe me, it isn’t. They make up for it with the size and quality of the dishes. The glutinous rice was a joke. Hardly any filling, the rice was mushy more than glutinous and it was tiny, half the size of a playing card. Much better food around in China Town. Hey, go to the award winning and Michelin Star, Hawker Chan place two minutes walk away where an excellent meal there will set you back $3; yes, three dollars. That just puts things into perspective. Avoid Yum Cha.

After a long time not visit this restaurant, now we come again while we visited Singapore. The dimsum quality still the best and they served also very fast and good even the restaurant is full. We come there at 10.00 am and it's already full seated

We were recommended to go by our hotel concierge. We were very disappointed with the food, and the service the staff could not care less. When ordering for myself, and my husband I wanted vegetarian food this is what we asked for at the hotel. The meal was under the bean curd section but contained pork. When I asked the staff member she just smiled even laughed. I have never eaten meat in my whole life I knew something was wrong. I am so upset, and unwell due to never having meat. If you want a good resurant with vegetarian food don't go. If you want good service don't go, and if you want a good atmosphere don't go. All I can say is don't g

With review from trip advisor wanted to try some original dim sum . The ones we get in India are the indianised version with 3 choices .( steamed fried or Schzwan ) . We tried 5 of the numerous choices ( Xiao Long Bao ,Fish Roe with Siew Mai ,Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling ,Fried Carrot Cake , and a green colored open looking one forgot the name ). The Crab meat with Thick Corn Soup was plenty for us a family with 2 kids . we also had Braised Ee-Fu Noddles and the total bill after tips was 80 SGD . Most of the crowd where locals and YUM CHA is placed partly hidden in china street . But if you can look in google street view in maps I think you can easily locate the place . except for the fried carrot cake and the endless jasmine tea we loved all the food . it is an excellent try out for anyone looking for exceptional food in Singapore . The asst captain( as the badge read ) was a pleasent and very helpful girl and the atmosphere can't be better as we are in china town .You are reminded that it is china town so don't expect plates forks knifes e.t.c . When in Rome be a Roman . I looked at the way the locals where eating with chopsticks and bowl and followed suit

I had a very good experience at Yum Cha and would definitely visit again when in Singapore. I got there on Sunday at approx. 1pm and it was not as busy as I had expected, so I got a table right away. I tried the Yum Cha prawn dumplings, the chive dumplings, and of course the Xiao Long Bao (my favorites). For dessert I had the mini egg tarts and the red bean banana pancake. All of these were delicious and I enjoyed the entire meal. Service was prompt and also really friendly (which I hadn't expected based on some other reviews)

Singaporean friends had recommended this yum cha/dim sum to us and I’m so glad we went there for brunch one Sunday.The restaurant is near the Chinatown complex in the heart of Chinatown and can be a little hard to find – look for the elevated sign as the restaurant is on the second floor above a shop.We arrived about 11am and weren’t sure if we would get in as we hadn’t made a booking and their website indicated bookings were necessary, however, we were lucky enough to walk straight in and be seated.I cannot remember all the dishes we had but we were pretty stuffed by the end of it and it was all really delicious. We didn’t know what each dish cost as we were going along as the food tally was all in Chinese, but were agreeably surprised when the bill was about S$50. The waiters/waitresses were all really pleasant and friendly and the restaurant large and bustling mostly with Chinese families (we only noticed one other Caucasian family), which we always take as a good sign. We were also happy early enough to miss the long queue that was amassing for lunch at about 12.30pm.I would strongly recommend Yum Cha and we will certainly return when next in Singapore
4
Located on the second floor. Walk up access only at the moment as lift is out of service. Good afternoon enjoyed eating house made dim sum. Some of the best tastings included Xiao Long Bao and Fish Roe Side Mai. They will charge you at the end for the peanuts and wet-towel pack that is already set on the table before you arrive. Nice Chinese tea
5
Located on 2nd floor you have to cut thru a hotel as stairs are under repair. Old school but delicious. Xiao long bao are handmade. Not pretty like Din Tai Fung but actually juicier. Crepe roll was thin and in a light broth. Not heavy which i liked. Full dim sum menu. Good value.
5
Went for lunch. Good service. Ordered 3 dim sum each to share- all were really good especially the Xiao long bao buns. Price wasn't too bad either
4
Nice affordable delicious dinner sum with many choices. Difficult to attract waiters' attention maybe due to peak periods. will visit again.
4
This restaurant is very reasonable in this expansive city. There are lots of variety in food served by wagons in an old style.
3
It was my first time visiting this restaurant. It is was recommended by my Friend.
Food 7/10
Service 9/10
Ambience 7/10 the place was a bit stuffy
Price 7/10
Overall, it was a good experience. I would recommend to try out swatow or red star.
3
I didn't know what my girlfriend ordered but it was delicious! The best dish was the scallop pea-shoot dumpling.
2
We were disappointed as we used to come at this place years back and the food, athmosphere and service were much nicer...
Even the table was not stable...
4
We visited for a late lunch on a Saturday, no queuing, it was reasonably quiet, we enjoyed two pots of oolong tea and a great selection of dumplings. Particularly enjoyed the Yum Cha Prawn dumpling and the scallop pea-shoot ones. Prices are reasonable, service is quite fast. Lift not working at the time of our visit, the stairs are around the corner next to a shop entrance
4
One of the good mid range dim sum restaurants in spore. Prepare to queue especially weekend lunch. Quality is good for certain dishes but not consistent. Lots of seat and served by traditional push cart to deliver the hot steam dim sum to your table. Good for family and Friend gathering with reasonable price. A bit noisy but food serve pretty fast so your queue time can cut down even is long queue. Located in Chinatown Trengganu street at level 2.. a bit hard to find but you can always ask around .
2
We went on a busy bank holiday and were seated within 30mins. Not bad. The dim sum trollers were great and the food was nice. Problem started when we ordered a la carte. The sweet and sour pork was tasteless and sauce very greasy. We wondered if the pork was cooked thoroughly because it had a funny texture. A member of our group vomited after the meal so sure the pork was not cooked properly. The spicy Aubergine hotpot was not spicy and again lots of oil and cornstarch. Don't order a la carte there and stay away from pork
4
This is a surprisingly large hole-in-the-wall type dim sum restaurant with excellent food. The restaurant's somewhat hidden on the second floor of a hostel, with entrances through the hostel's lobby and through a souvenir shop. You can order from the good-sized menu, but the staff also wheels around numerous freshly made dishes for you to choose from. Everything my group of folk tried from the wide variety of dishes was all very good. (Admittedly, there were things that weren't to my taste, but what I didn't like, one or more of my friends thoroughly enjoyed.
5
there are lots of variaties of dim sum to choose from. and they all tasted fresh and delicious. will come back again for sure
2
Food and service ok
Very pricey
Disgusting toilets
You can find better dim sum experience in the area.
4
Sui mai and ha gao are quite nice. But what I like most is chicken cooked in paper,chicken wings are tender and sauce is tasty,I can feel a scent of ginger and soya sauce.
4
Simple team dinner @ Yumcha, the Service staff was quite friendly and helpful with all our requests.
4
Food was good. Not too crowded. More on the pricey side though. Quite small serving for the porridge.
5
A group of friends went there for dim sum buffet which costs $23 ++ and it's served every weekday between 3-6 pm. I was quite surprised by the quality of the food as everything we ordered tasted great. We were more than 10 people so we order a lot different dishes and managed to try a lot. I've heard from friends that the quality is not as good in the evening as they use the leftover from the buffet and many dishes are not available. But I haven't been there for dinner so can't be sure. Though I can recommend the weekday buffet 100%
2
Visited this place today for their dim sum.. was disappointed as it doesn't taste nice maybe not up to my expectation. The texture and overall was kinda bad.. I read some of the review saying the ha gao and siew mai was nice but it really is not, except of the prawn filling which was fresh. I didn't try the rest of dishes though, maybe will visit another time for the dishes but never coming back for the dim sum
2
Went to Yum Cha in Chinatown for lunch today with the family. I had tasted good dim sum there before and was expecting more or less the same.Unfortunately, today's lunch of dim sum was anything but nice. The seafood fried rice was tasteless, so was the BBQ Pork Rice Flour Roll.The deep fried dishes of Fried Carrot Cake and Sesame BBQ Pork Pastry were cold. Probably cooked earlier and left on the service counter for too long.Basically, if this is the standard now, I strongly won't recommend anyone to spend your money there
5
The dim sum was excellent. One of the best shrimp sui mai and fried wantons Iâ€‹ ever had with lots of shrimp. Service was good ( I have seen lots of complaints in the forum ) Din Tai Fung Xiao long bao are better. Good Jasmin tea to go with the meal
3
Unable to understand... by adding order, we just need to fill in used paper forms & the service folks will know the difference. They lecture us "There's no need to inform them". ... Mmmm???... Super Power! p.s. The extra food filled in the used paper form did not arrive. Ha! wonder why... lol
1
Horrible cheap dim sum with horrible service and dirty ambience.
If you are short of cash and want some dim sum, you can come here.
4
The bill for 4 is from 70 to 100 SGP including refilled Jasmine tea. Good place to have lunch while other restaurants open after 12 which is quite late for my stomach. Try Crispy salmon skin and Shark fin with meat dumplings.
4
Dim sum are yummy. Must try stem pork ribs, tenderror and juicy. Definitely will come back again for the good dim sum.
3
Came here for Father's Day treat. The 3 basic requirements for a Dim Sum Restaurant are pork dumplings (Xiu Mai), shrimp dumplings (Har Kau) and Braised Chicken Feet (Feng Zhao) to taste the freshness of pork, shrimp and chicken. Had good meals at this restaurant before. Was surprised that the Xiu Mai is still ok but the Feng Zhao is tasteless. Off day for the Chef
3
The food is good given the price paid! However, the service staff was unprofessional and rude. They're unwilling to serve and zero smiles on the face. Well, I'm there for the food and to allow my grandma to enjoy so I chose to let it go for the time being
4
Decided to bring my colleague since it's her first time in Singapore for some dim sum. There was a short line and around a 15 minute waiting time before we were seated. Because we went on a Saturday, the buffet was sadly not available.My favourite was the dumpling with fish maw at the base. Because items are pushed around in trolleys, we mainly grabbed what ever looked good without knowing the names. The soup dumpling though was quite disappointing because it lacked flavour and the skin was really thick. Overall it wasn't too bad. Not the worst but not the best either
1
I was at Yum Cha, Chinatown SG, for lunch with my spouse on 23 May 2017. After placing our dim sum order, I proceeded to the washroom at about 12:45 pm to wash my hands as habitual before my meal.In the washroom, I noticed a Yum Cha staff coming out a toilet cubicle and just rinsed his fingers tip quickly at the wash basin next to me. He did not bother to use soap and to wash his hands thoroughly. There was a poster on the wall next to the basins with pics and instructions, apparently for staff, how to wash their hands thoroughly with soap and wash after using the toilet. When he saw me looking at him with disbelief, all he did was smiled and walked out.I am not sure if he handles food there. But with that attitude in my presence as the customer, I wondered what he would do if he was alone with no one watching.Needless to say, I did not enjoy my lunch after that.I always thought Yum Cha served quite good dim sum. Now I have great doubts about the standard of staff discipline and hygiene. Yum Cha?, never again
5
Beer usually isn't cheap in a Singapore restaurant, but Tiger Draft was just $5 SGD at Yum Cha. We actually drank Chinese tea. The Dim Sum wasn't especially exotic, but was consistently excellent and unlike a lot of Singapore Dim Sum places, they have carts! Even though they have carts, request a menu as soon as you sit down in case you want something on the back, like noodles or vegetables. Most of the stuff on the front side of the menu will eventually pass by on a cart
3
Variety of Chinese dim sum food to choose from, generally the taste is good however I feel that the food quality has slightly dropped over the years.They offer the trolley service where typically they will prepare popular dishes and wheel them around the dining area, where diners may choose to have as many plates from the trolley service (dish is priced as in the main menu, normally without discount). This might be a good idea if the crowd is large and your order might take awhile to come.Service has been generally good, however waiting time for the staff might be longer if there is a large crowd.Note:The lift has been noted to be spoilt for a long time, unaware if it has been fixed but do not take your chances if a member is not good with stairs. As noted by the other reviews
4
Now that trolley service has all but disappeared on the London dim sum scene it was a real treat to see it in action in Singapore. A decent selection of both steamed and fried dim sum, the usual suspects like ha gau and siu mai but a few unusual dishes I had not seen before too. If you couldn't see what you wanted on the trolley just ask and it would emerge from the kitchen. Portion wise its like it used to be in London about 30 years ago but where London got smaller these portions remained ample
5
Will take you a while to find but authentic Chinese food, very popular, very efficient and speedy friendly service
4
But the restaurant did not received my chope reservation. Luckily there are enough seats for 7 of us.
2
Service was not great, and variety is limited....no signature dish to look forward to....elevator was not functioning so my 90 years old father had to climb the tall stairway
5
Good food and nice ambience, highly recommend the xiao long bao! Service was good and the staff were friendly and helpful in recommendation of dishes
3
We love Yum cha and whilst what we had was OK we expected better. Yum Cha in Auckland NZ is a lot lot better quality. As other reviewers have noted the escalator is still not fixed and the entrance to the restaurant is off a side street amidst stalls up a steep flight of stairs.l;The trolleys come around and you can pick what you want. We asked for bar b cue pastries and prawn rice rolls and they came nice and hot. The har gau were OK and we liked the scallop and pea dumpling which was the highlight. We didn't like the Dan (egg) tart too sweet for us and not a good texture. A very busy restaurant with fairly impersonal service. We had to queue for over 10 minutes to pay the bill no idea what they were doing. There are much better YUM Cha restaurants than this one
2
The restaurant was located at the second floor of the shophouse. Although it was weekday, it was packed with lots of tourists. Menu was a single 2 sided tick list. I was showed to a table by the window. Although there was power under the table, it was not working. So don't plan to charge your hp while eating.Pumpkin Yam Golden Cake 金瓜竽丝糕 (S$4.20++/ 3pcs)The texture was not bad with its crispy top, but it was a tab jelat if having more than a piece and quite oily towards the end. Taste was one dimension.Squid Ink Dumpling 顺鼓墨鱼饺 (S$4.80++/ 3pcs)The folds wasn't perfect. One piece wasn't even folded in.Yum Cha Prawn Dumpling 饮茶虾饺皇 (S$5.20++/ 3pcs)There's holes in the dumplings. I was surprised to find this kind of standard in their signature dumplings.Home-made Almond Tea 杏仁茶 (S$4.20++)The texture wasn't rich and creamy. It looked kind of like the instant type - sweet and lumpy. Service was spotty. I was told to go to the cashier when I asked for the bill. I could spot customers with their bills served to them at their tables. Also spotted that the next table of Japanese customers had a piece of plastic in his glass of beer. The staff who cleared the glass blamed on the plastic covering the ice cubes, but did not apologize. One could see clearly that the group of customers was clearly upset. Although the customer was later told by another staff that the glass of beer would be waived from the bill, the damage had already been done
3
Visited this restaurant ten years ago and had happy memories. This visit found the food much the same. A good selection of yum Cha and mains. Service was adequate and fast. We arrived late morning and by the time we left, about 1.00pm, the tables were mostly taken. Entry to this restaurant can be confusing as the street entrance is hidden under a covered footpath which is crowded by stalls. Walk up a flight of stairs and follow your nose to enter the restaurant. One big complaint is that when my wife went to the restroom she returned saying it was very dirty and she would need to seek another restroom. I visited the gentlemen's and found the same although I managed a successful visit. Some Asian countries are known for poor lavatory management and it was a surprise to find this in a well established restaurant in Chinatown. On the basis of the restrooms, we would not return and recommend only if you have a strong bladde
4
This is a great place for dim sum, but not if you’re a novice. It’s too crowded to bring around carts so you can see what you’re getting. So you order everything off a paper menu by noting how many of a particular dish you want. So if you don’t mind the noise and can go with someone who knows their way around dim sum, the food is excellent
5
We had a good quantity of dim sum and we spent considerable amount of time in the restaurant. I must say, the service was simply impeccable. They took care to attend to every single detail; including ensuring that we ate the item while it was hot; and ensuring that our tea cups were always filled. I was impressed and touched
2
Went back here for lunch after first couple of meals here on a previous trip... While ok, it was a disappointment this time, with a vastly reduced Yum Cha menu, most of the common favourites are gone, not to be found... Sad! The place has become a little tired. If you are after great or even good food, don't go here, seek out other options in Singapore.
3
Nothing special. Very crowded and noisy. Need to speak louder so that people across the table are able to listen.
4
Very popular with locals and tourists. Excellent dim sum and dumplings. love to go there for lunch with family and friends.
4
If you are a dim sum amateur, here is a restaurant for you in the heart of Chinatown not far from the interesting Chinatown heritage center.Essentially patronized by locals, there are few foreigners which is a good indication.I loved the scallops and green peas dim sum as well as the traditional siu mai.When you arrive at your table ask for the illustrated menu if you are not familiar with the food and fill up the form and waive it to the waiter. Service is minimal and the cashier doesn't even look at you ! But the lunch was an enjoyable classic
5
We went there near to chinese new year and we almost did not found the entrance who is surrounded by shops . Plenty of yummy Dimsum of all sorts . This is not a fancy restaurant , its quite noisy , but its clean , the service is good , and you will pay about 15dollars , not more 
4
We went here twice and enjoyed dim sum. The restaurant is usually quite crowded but I don't believe you need reservations. Lots of choices and the prices are reasonable. It is located in Chinatown. It is a little hard to find but follow the "tea cup" symbols which are their logo. It is on the second floor of a building
4
Shaky staircase leads into a bustling restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Carts in the room, laden with baskets pork ribs with sweet potatoes, yams and samami dim sum with shrimp and spinach make an impression even on those who are Asia - a sweet home
2
We are a fan of dimsum having had these since we were young. The typical Chinese dishes you'll see in the Philippines. We also have done a lot of dimsum exploration in HK.Being in the CNY season, we wanted to have dimsum and a walk around Chinatown. Yum Cha is very popular.The ambiance is close to HK dimsum places with the noise, push cart food and most servers speaking only Chinese The food looked authentic. But the taste was far from our expectations. The siomai were the best and that's the only one that got a repeat order. Everything else was just to try and unfortunately, no repeat. To be clear, the dimsum was not bad. Just that the expectations to be the same as authentic HK dimsum was not met.Quite a pricey place too with dished between $4-5 per plate
2
I have been brought to this restaurant in Chinatown twice by 2 different tour guides so I assume that it must have been popular and good at one time. However on both occasions the food was a letdown and the ambience very average. So I don't understand why the tour guides keep bringing us here.
4
he choice for breakfast from my hotel (the Inn at Temple St) was limited to McDonalds or chinese. For an Aussie used to toast and vegemite for breakfast, dumplings were a shock. But they were delicious. Good value - and being over the road from my hotel very convenient. I made the right choice
3
Used to visit this restaurant quite often but today is a let down cos both lift and escalator were out of order and my father in law had to struggle to reach the place in second floor . Food still ok but the place is jammed pack . Food served at quick pace though crowded
4
Wide variety of Catonese Dim Sums, yet not too expensive. Comfortably air-conditioned with close service at a call. Great for breakfast and brunch.
4
Stopped by this place as part of a Viator trip to China Town. The food was very good and plentiful. The restaurant was clean and the staff friendly. Would recommend if in the area.
5
Food was good and the service staff were very friendly and helpful :) food came really quickly upon ordering!
4
it's very easy to reach this restaurant, only a couple of minutes from Chinatown MRT exit on Pagoda street. their weekday dim sum offer at less than S$ 25++ per pax is a very good deal. fast service, wide range of dishes and the ambiance is real
5
I've read some articles about this restaurant, and convinced me to give it a try. It is located among the major streets in Chinatown area. The ambience is not that attractive, however people keep on coming back for its taste. I highly recommend the xiao long bao, and their garlic pork
4
The food is not bad and the service could be rude. This is not unusual for these very popular places. You come here for breakfast in the Sunday morning. If you don't mind being pushed a bit and other minor issues, this is a good place to start in China Town.
2
This is a restaurant I really look forward to going to, however this time it was very disappointing. They charged for the nuts on the table and even for the hand towels. The service was so slow that I had to get up several times and make the waiters come over to our table. The person behind the bill counter was so slow it made me think that she was putting on an act. Food was average and a bit expensive. I ordered a fried rice five times and it took twenty minutes by which time my three year old was hysterical, I ended up having to take it with me. Last time I was here I would have rated it a four at least
3
We were on our honeymoon when we visited Singapore in Jan 2015 (can't change the year so have put 2016) and this was our first meal that we had picked prior to coming to the city. It was very highly rated among others in Chinatown so we decided to give it a try. We tried a lot of their dimsum and it was good but I wasn't impressed. Service was also a bit slow so I was little annoyed. Overall i'd say it was an Ok meal
4
Had dinner here with family on a Sunday.The place was not difficult to find, but the fact that it shares the same entrance as a hotel might throw some people off. When we arrived at 6pm the place was not crowded, but quickly fill up later on. Make a reservation if you want to secure a table.The number of items on their Dim-Sum menu was rather limited (about 20); apparently they have more items during lunch time. They also have other dishes (vegetables, meat, fish, etc.) available.Service was good: staff were friendly and service was prompt.The food was nice; nothing fanciful but tasty enough. Price was reasonable too.Definitely a place worth visiting repeatedly
4
Was pretty good - not amazing but it hit the mark. Beware that the peanuts placed in front of you while you wait for the dumplings to come around aren't free! The place is clean enough if a bit tricky to find - it really is up the stairs through the unassuming door.
5
There is nothing fancy about this place but the meals are first class the service was impeccable the staff are friendly even though they may not speak English
5
Wonderful, tasty Chinese food. Dim sum was perfect, also had sweet sour pork, beef with green onions and fried rice. A truly authentic Chinese meal.
Situated above Jingshen hotel, look out for signs on the wall !
4
Yum Cha is popular not only with locals but tourists alike. No the easiest place to find but the restaurant specialises in dim sum and chinese cuisine. The waiting staff also push round trolleys with steaming dim sum which is novel. Weekends are especially busy.
5
Good dim sum, it can get quite busy so you might have to wait to be seated. There is a large variety of traditional dim sum to try on at affordable prices.
3
+ eat all you can dimsum and chinese desserts
+ walking distance to Chinatown train station
- pricey at SGD24 per person excluding tax
- can be hard to locate the shop
3
The food is not bad. The price is cheap and with Safra card you get 30% off on weekday evening. The place is average but it's on 2nd level but the elevator is faulty.
4
The dim sum was really enjoyable and I liked how the dim sum was pushed around in trolleys like in HK. Not many places in Singapore keep to this tradition. If you're on a budget, this place isn't too friendly on your wallet, I spent about $57 for 2 people on about 10 dishes, the food was filling and satisfying! There is a long queue on weekends so do go early
3
Tried the main outlet in Chinatown for lunch this week. We had 6 different dim sum options and some porridge - all were pretty good and the service was quite efficient. Not too crowded on a Friday lunchtime so no need for a reservation. Worth another visit
5
Yum Cha is my favorite dim sum place in Singapore. The restaurant gives the traditional dim sum feel with aunties rolling their carts of dim sum around. The menus are in English and Chinese so you can order dishes that aren't on the carts. The only challenging thing about this restaurant is finding it if you are not familiar with Chinatown. Thankfully, there are signs above that clearly say, "Yum Cha.
5
By far the best Chinese food I've ever tried! Can't wait to come back to Singapore to eat there again! Warm and friendly staff. Very clean and organized too. Dim Sum to die for! Hard to say which dish was the most remarkable as were so yummy and fresh! Highly recommended
2
Lunched at Yum Cha today and while the food was tasty, service was terrible. Seemed only interested in having you eat what was available immediately on the cart rather than ordering anything else - even though on menu.
3
Foods were average, location at level 2 easy to find the place
Staff with flat face was servicing us.
The place is good to pit stop for snacking..before you continue your exploration at famous Chinna Town.

The price is reasonable. However, food is not fantastic at all. I believe what you pay is what you get. The place is very warm as well despite having fans around.

Had the peking duck. They offer a half duck order so it was just right for me. They come to the table to carve it up and make wraps for you. They did it a little differently though, they rolled a piece of skin with with a pretty large chunk of green onion and cucumber. I would have much preferred if they julienne the green onion into small pieces. The duck also didn't have much flavor compared to other times I've had it
4
Not so easy to find but once up the mini escalator you could be in deepest China. Lovely cup of tea accompanies the buffet - go from 15:00 and you will get the lot.. including the chicken feet. Lovely selection ... go for it, you know you want to.

My family goes there whenever we are in Singapore; this is one of our favorites eateries. What we like about YUM CHA-There is baby chair; not that we need it, but for those who needs to know here it is.- We , of course, like the Dim Sum or Chinese Tapas (my interpretation of it); i have enclosed a copy of the food we ordered please refer to the picture with the ticks.-Everyone there spoke English with a local accent , of course:-). So, they could help you with your order-They have a pictorial menu too ; if that helps-During the weekends, the way they served Dim Sum was different from during the weekdays; they have a trolley dolly during the weekends :-) you could just get up from your seat; go upfront, pick and choose your Dim Sum; a lovely experience. -Seats were spacious; one could sit comfortably. -If you go with your kids would be quite a nice experience for your kids to pick their own Dim Sum; this only happens during the weekends though.There were fish tanks just outside the restaurant for a visit to a very small aquarium;-) The only thing we dislike is that the toilet were wet always, and dirty looking so watch out for slippery floorTips:-To get value for your money eat during these hours 15:00-18:00; it is buffet hours. We are travelers; we wake up late; we have late breakfast therefore late lunch would not be a bad idea at this establishment - If you do not need wet tissues and/or peanuts you could ask them removed these items from your bills otherwise you would be paying for what you didn't need-The Q usually dies down at 14:00. So, you either go early like 10:30-11:30 or after 14:00 or between 15:00 to 18:00.This was my personal experience, of course, you might be so unlucky getting caught in the long Q. -It depends on which entrance you enter; one of the entrances involve climbing up a long flight of stairs, other entrances involve lift access or escalator .Should you come to the entrance with stairs and you need the escalator or lift just go round the corner; you would find yourself having a choice of escalator or lift. I hope my review have been useful to you; enjoy your visit to YUM CHA...Bon appétit

Nestled in the 2nd floor of Jinshan Hotel is Yum Cha restaurant: If you had experienced Dim Sum restaurant, you will find there all its traditional and typical elements: Quick service, fresh food, and the traditional large round tables making it more convivial.When you eat dim sum the waiter is not there to entertain you to explain the menu or answer your many questions: This may be a bit strange for westerners who usually try to establish a connection with the waiter. Traditional dim sum places used to have a cart coming out of the kitchen full of dishes that you just pick-up along the way feeding a large crowd: While regrettably the cart is not used anymore, the concept somehow remains as you order on a sheet the items you want, which are then successively placed on your table.The food is good, freshly made, and you get a bit of a quiet time in this restaurant from all the buzzling of activities around Chinatown: I would go there again

I don't like to give any poor marks in my reviews, but I can't help it this time.This restaurant has received many good reviews on the Tripadvisor, and was acclaimed for offering good food for reasonable prices in the guidebook we brought. As we stand in line to get a table, I saw people apparently from all over the world as well as locals; my expectations for their food were raised.However, as another reviewer commented, the atmosphere was like a busy factory. It didn't look particularly clean. As we sat at a table, a waitress busily brought us a pot of tea and wet paper napkins along with a menu. What surprised me later was that the tea and the napkins were chargeable; we certainly didn't order them in the first place! The pot of tea turned out to be the most expensive item on the bill at 5.40 SGD.The food quality was okay. As they offered dishes off the pushcart, we didn't bother to look at the menu. The prices of the dishes ranged from 3.80 to 4.80. Some people say their dim sums are of the top quality; I thought they were just above the average. The service charge of 10% was added at the end though I didn't feel we had received any special "service" to speak of. After all, you wouldn't be met with much smile at all, and the unasked-for items are charged.Does the total cost of 42.50 SGD for seven dim sum dishes (and tea and towels) sound reasonable? I just don't know.On the way back, we saw many other good-looking, cleaner eateries with smiling wait staff in the China Town. Why not give it a try at another restaurant next time? Would I come back to this restaurant in my future visits to Singapore? Definitely no

We got a recommendation of two mature locals that this shall be one of the best Dim Sum Restaurants in Singapore. The food is good and the spicy soup a good pick. If you like more the food market style you find very good Dim Sum around there as well.

very tasty dim sum
egg tart was perfect.
squid ink dumpling, steamed fish maw, shark fin xiao long bao, century egg congee is very tasty
prawn mango sesame fritters is a must. dont miss this one.. 😬
4
Excellent tim sum in an old house in the center of China town. The quality remains equal through the years, i have never been desppointed. Efficient service. I recommand this restaurant for a genuine Chinese dinner
4
Really large range of Dim Sum, all that we tasted were excellent. Service was fast. Bit of a tricky place to find, but worth it.
3
Good Yum Cha but can get busy. best times to go - 11am and after 3pm. Seafood is good and tasty. Can order off menu - but need to ask staff - prawns very great. Warning - you have to pay for peanuts and towelettes
1
Four of us entered the resturant for a meal, we decided the meals were a little too expensive for us so just ordered four entrees and a jug of tiger beer (equals 4 glasses at a cost of $38 for the jug).There were few meals that were reasonably priced but they ranged up to $160 +The staff were so rude we decided to leave, i usually read reviews like mine & think that maybe it is the customer that is the issue as i have never had an experience like this before, we would have stayed & paid the high prices but decided we could not put up with the staff & the fact there was no atmosphere what so ever. We were also brought a small dish of peanuts which we thought were complimentary as with the servettes placed on the table, when paying we were shocked to find a charge of $2 for the peanuts & $1.20 for the servettes, when questioned the lady at the register said it was not much for the peanuts etc, i replied the issue was we were not advised that we were being charged for same.Will not recomend this resturant or go back, ever !

This family favorite place would've gotten 4 stars from me if their service wasn't atrocious. We like coming for the weekday high tea buffet once in awhile because their dim sums are above average and their price is super value for money. We went again yesterday, the 7 of us. It was pretty crowded and though there were many many staff, all of them managed to not see any patrons in the restaurant. And when I did get the attention of one (for maybe some sauce or tea), they would push responsibilities back and fourth to each other until it didn't come, or we get our item after we finished our dumplings. We were rudely told to wait quite a number of times, and a paper literally shoved in my face telling me to "circle what I wanted" cuz she couldnt be bothered to listen to and remember my order. We were also told to wait and get things from the push carts even though we ordered after we didn't see the items we wanted on the pushcart. So we waited and nothing came out. There are a TON of things on the menu that you must order because they don't come on the pushcarts. I think they just put the most popular things on the carts and hope you don't order more. But the buffet does promise some 65 items or so. And even then we would order 2 baskets of something (because there are 7 of us) and yet only 1 would arrive. The a la carte service is slightly better, though not a whole rating point better. Service aside, the food is worth coming for, which is why we do

We were looking to just have some Dim Sum for dinner in Chinatown, and decided on this one based on a combination of location (from where we were) and menu. We just ordered nine different dishes and shared everything.I especially enjoyed the Scallop Pea-shoot Dumplings and Prawn & Mango Sesame Fritters.

Food delicious but Manager attitude was terrible.We brought our overseas relatives to lunch at Yum Cha Chinatown Restaurant.We were assigned to the table beside a cabinet which initially we thought is for decoration purpose.Suddenly, a Manager in white polo shirt went to open the cabinet, he didn't tell us to give way. Instead he chase away our elderly guest who was sitting closest to the cabinet without waiting for her to stand up and move. Luckily she did not get hurt from this sudden action.The manager even blamed her for sitting there and blocking his way. Since the restaurant assigned us that particular table and we sat as per their seat arrangement, why are we blamed for sitting next to the cabinet?If this cabinet need to be opened often, why they set the seat just besides it? If due to space constraint, manager should know that this condition is not customer's fault
5
As a frequent visitor to Singapore, Yum Cha restaurant in Chinatown is always the first stop on every trip. An excellent selection of dim sum delicacies (including chicken feet) with fast and efficient service.A well-known, popular gem that should be heritage listed for its longevity.
5
I'm very glad that our friend guided us here. It's seriously one of the best (if not the best) dim sum place ever! I think there's a menu that is only available at 11am but I forgot what the menu is. We tried to find it the second time (w/o our friend) and couldn't find it anymore :( . Definitely will come back when we go back in Singapore
5
There is a very wide selection of food to select from. Reasonably priced and good service. Highly recommended.
5
Convenient to use this service. Do not need to call for reservation. Good food, fast service and delicious food. But slight noisy.
4
Second visit and didn't disappoint, great yum cha food with a good variety and quick service, fun and full of atmosphere.
4
The staff were very attentive and food wasn't bad. Very near MRT and not too crowded. Not exactly cheap, but good variety and service was good.
4
Craving yum cha, my hotel pointed me to this restaurant.
I was alone but starving!
I had 5 different types of yum cha and they were all great.
Definitely worth a visit in Chinatown 😊👍 !
4
This is a very pleasant and bustling restaurant in Chinatown that should certainly be visited at least once, as they accommodated us well. The air conditioned dining area has a casual feel and attentive, if slightly pushy, staff that endeavour to please, even if they do not sometimes understand exactly what you want.We ordered creamy corn soup, wok fried chicken with stir fried local vegetables and scrambled egg and the stir fried fish fillet which were piping hot, good portioned and served without waiting too long
4
No Doubt you can find many other dim sum restaurants in Singapore, but at the end of the day, we always come back to this one ! Mid-low price range, air-conditioned, no queue (if you can be there earlier or make reservation for bigger group, we always visit there on Sunday 9.30am - NO QUEUE)We love it because the food is good and the ambience is very Oriental. They serve dim sum on different push-carts during the weekend. A casual eateries located in the middle of ChinaTown. If you are visiting China Town this is one of the must-go (we always bring our visitors here and they loved it). 2 Person spent around $30 for dim sum brunch. (not bad
5
So there maybe cheaper dim sum in Singapore and it is everywhere we found the dim sum here to be quite delicious. Stopped by for a pre dinner snack and it was quite full. I can say you aren't going to get five star service and might have to track down the servers but they seemed to be doing their best to serve the guest and clear and clean. Very easy to locate and as I said quite big with awesome fried and non fried choices. The steamed scallop was just awesome.
3
i'm a big fan of Dimsum, but the portion here is small and expensive. Taste average and not worth the money.Not to be picky, but it takes long time for the food to be served.only ate a little bit and the bill was close to SGD 100average is about 4.20 per dim sum with 3 little small pieces of food.don't think will come here againsorr
3
I do not want to make accusations of what ingredients were put in here, but after my tim sum tea break here with my friends, we ALL felt extremely thirsty an hour later. We all suspect that more than just salt was added to make the food all so tasty (and indeed the food was very good). But tasty food should not be due to adding (that particular ingredient) and I am most disappointed. I aint coming back here ANYMORE
4
This our forth time we have eaten at this restaurant, it didn't disappoint . This authentic dim sum is the best in Chinatown we were the only non chinese in the restaurant which says a lot about the food . Great value for money.
4
We ate at yum Cha as part of out Chinatown tour, there was quite a variety of food to try from the set menu. We did not leave hungry !
3
Ok,it's basically cantina,no place for business lunch or romantic dinnerVisited for the first time,had dim sums only but they are really ok,and the price is really cheap,what else?Reed some reviews regarding staff and design,frankly-don't careFour off us overeating for the total price off 100 singapore dollars?With good sums,come on.
1
I received a confirmation email from Chope only to go to the restaurant on the day itself to find out that they never received the booking. It was a friend's birthday and there were 10 of us and of course the restaurant was not able to accommodate us. Had to scramble to find another place to go to. Better to call the restaurant directly instead of going through Chope
3
The food is nice with lots of variety but the waitress service is really bad. Placing order with smile to them and even by saying thank you but return you are all black face attitude.. Seem that they doesn't welcome you there to eat at all ... Hah
3
For authentic tasting dim sum but served in relatively larger portions, Yum Cha is the place to go. However, our favourite egg tart has suffered a huge drop in standard. It's been served cold and lacks the usual soft fluffy texture and aroma. Otherwise, other usual suspects like siew mai (steamed pork dumplings), har kao (prawn dumpling) and rice dumplings still taste good. Service, however can be improved. Serving crew was obviously overwhelmed but they tried their best to be hospitable. The same cannot be said of the young male manager, however. He was haughty and waved customers away to ask them to wait when he was busy. As a local, guess I am used to this but this may not be entirely pleasant for a tourist curious about local delicacies and can do with some patient serving staff who can explain the wonderful flavours that Yum Cha can offer. In short, go purely for its food and expect nothing from their service.
2
The place is like a factory, so busy.Staff have no time to give any attention as they are running all over the place. Very busy.Dim sum are great, tasty but unfortunately one more place that don't give sh... about the shark fin awful trade and offer shark fin dim sum on their menu.Not recommended at all
4
This yum cha (dim sum) place is the best and most authentic I have been to in Singapore. While we were there there was only 1 other non Chinese in the restaurant which I think says a lot about the food because the Chinese really love to eat. My friend and I shared 9 dishes and 2 pots of tea for a total of S $69.Great valu
4
This place is excellent - lots of choices, little servings of everything so you can try as much as possible, cheap(ish) for Singapore and quality, efficient service. The only disappointing thing was that you had to have shark fin Xiao Long Bao. I love this dish but don't like contributing to the practice of killing off the world's sharks. Get the dumplings in chili oil and the pork buns. Bon appetit!
5
There are about 5 gazillion places to eat in Singapore, and many of them are really good. One place where great healthy vegetarian food was a bit of a surprise was in the middle of Chinatown, close to Buddha shrine.Yum Cha is great, but takes just a little looking to find. Hidden among the street stalls is a stairway that leads up to Yum Cha. They weren’t very friendly, but the food is great. Half of the menu is available as steamed and half is fried. So if you want the healthier choices, you have a lot to choose from. On the steamed side, are a lot of non-meat items. I tried the bean curd with supreme sauce, and it was really good. Also, the steamed dumpling with asparagus and shrimp was heavenly. The prices are pretty good too. Most items are $2.5 to $4 Singapore. I ordered 3 items and the bill was $20 SG, pretty cheap and great food. So even though it’s a little hard to find, give Yum Cha a try. It’s really good
2
Popped in here for a quick casual dim sum dinner and left disappointed. The prawn with mango was the the highlight. Friendly staff but significantly inferior to both Spring Court and Yann Palace. Will not return
4
The Dimsum was really good and the price is affordable. The steam fish maw in shrimp paste is good. The restaurant area was quite big.
5
I would say the Yum Cha Restaurant beats many dim sum places in Singapore and Hong Kong.The dim sum was good, there was a wide variety of dishes.We liked almost everything we had - prawn in crispy beancurd skin; mango prawn in crepe; xiao long bau; pai kuat; feng chau; 2 types of porridge; rice in lotus leaf; ha kou; siew mai; egg tarts. Deserving special mention were the salted egg custard buns; on the other hand, the sauce for their cheong fun was a bit thin and light for our taste.We went there on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite packed. The tables were quite close to one another and the dim sum trolleys plied whatever walkways available. While there was the ubiquitous dim sum restaurant din, still we could hold a decent lunch conversation. The service was better in than most Chinese restaurants in the category.There were 6 of us so all items were ordered in pairs, the bill came up to $120, which was very reasonable
5
Best dim sum ever.I really enjoyed my lunch here.I ordered several dishes for myself, my tummy was so full, I felt content :)Was a bit confuse to find the entrance - it was located between shops.I will surely be back for their dumpling and buns
5
If you like Yum Cha then you must visit this restaurant. It is located right in the heart of Chinatown and serves some of the best we've had. There was a queue on arrival, but it moved fairly quickly and we were seated after only about 15 minutes. The food was worth the wait and served on trolley by helpful staff. Prices were comparable to Australia and quality was second to none
4
This Ym Cha Restaurant is located on the first floor in Chinatown (20 Trengganu Street), and it is somewhat difficult to find. There are two entrances - one from the five-foot way hidden by souvenir stalls while the other from the entrance of Jinshan Hotel. From the former, ascend a flight of steps and from the latter, an escalation. The food is quite tasty and price reasonable. The service is efficient. If you are a first timer, you will probably be hungry and sweaty by the time you find this restaurant that straddles 3 shop lots on the second floor
4
Same names for all the dim sum dishes I have eaten all over the world. Here the dishes are not as oily. Some of the same name dishes made a little different but all great. Place does need a major update and lift needs to be fixed
5
Ok this Yum Cha was yummy. However it's not in the Santa grand hotel like Google says, it's a couple of doors down the street. Value for money tasty food, all day service.Just a tip if your looking for other places that serve similar food search for dim sum
5
Please give yourself a chance to check it out Dim Sum is one of the best PARTY FOOD, because they are mostly bite-sized and thus, easy to eat. If you are looking to plan a party for: the upcoming Holidays ,Office events or even a mini-Zoukout in your house, Yum Cha Express would be your ideal food host

Every time i come and stay around Chinatown area in Singapore, i always like to visit and eat Dimsum in this restaurant. Located just very near to Chinatown MRT, it is easy to find. The dimsum selection is quite original and most of them are good and tasty. The price is also still quite reasonable.So every time when i'm craving for some dimsum in Singapore, this restaurant will come in mind and so far it has not disappoint my taste bud. Recommended
3
Worth a try for tourists. Good solid Dim sum with acceptable service. Nice setting and good variety. I enjoyed myself but food is quite heavy.
5
Stumbled upon this restaurant while exploring Chinatown. So glad we did. Food was excellent both presentation and taste. Quick and very clean.
4
Lava Bun is the best. Dim Sum is great and resonable price. Restaurant is easy to find. If you are in that area, give it a try!
5
Huge servings for one person can feed two big eaters.We asked our double cooked fish to be done without any chily and they made wonderfull job.excatly how we thought shoul be done for our taste.
5
Good selection of dim sum. Love the traditional push cart style of serving dim sum. Staff are well trained and are always smiling. The char siew buns are my favorite.
4
Hidden away in China town this little treasure has great food, quick service. The venue ambiance is cheap but so is the bill. You won't need a mortgage to eat here and the food is great. Go and enjoy

Yum Cha has become my favourite dim sum restaurant in Singapore - buzzy atmosphere, Malacca style tables, trolley service, great dumplings and grumpy staff in the middle of Chinatown. Perfect ! You can also visit the nearby temple if heading this way. The dumpling pastry is excellent and the range of fillings pretty good - the one downside from this diver's view point is that the restaurant still offers a couple of dishes with shark's fin. Ho, hum. Is everything good ? No, I was disappointed by the cheung fun and the lotus leaf wrapped rice got the thumbs down as well. You may have to wait for a table at peak times but the turnover is quick and the queue orderly. Note that there are three ways of getting to Yum Cha, which is on the first (second in Singapore) floor, if you are laden or have a push chair - the stairs, and round the corner either an escalator or a lift. The well chilled beer is by the glass or by the pitcher, and tea is a good, non-alcoholic alternative. When you are starving and the trolleys arrive too slowly you can always ask one of the staff for the plates that you want and, if the sauce is a little for your taste just request some chopped chilli in soya. The greens of the day are fresh and cooked to order. Oh, and the price is very reasonable - maybe half that of London's Chinatown
5
Dim sum by push cart in this very crowded place in the heart of Chinatown. What can I say, great food, lot of variety, just order lots of reasonable priced dim sum and jasmin tea and I am sure you will be having a good time. Restaurant is on first floor, only stairs to go down
5
4 of us have to follow the signs in order to be able to find the location. It is located on the second,floor near a tuck away stairway. The place is about half filled but we have to wait for about 15 mins being second in line. Apparently the restaurant is short of staff. When we are finally shown our seat, we were given the standard menu only. Only after some while then we get the attention of a free staff, we asked and got the Chinese New Year (CNY) set menu. We quickly decided since there was just standard of either 4, 8 or 10 people set. It took another while before we place our order with the staff. There is the first Lou Hei salmon salad dish. There are a total of 7 dishes. the shark fin soup is the non thick kind of soup. All the dishes are good, with huge servings. It can probably be able to serve about 5-6 people depending on whether you have a big appetite. After dinner, you can get to enjoy the pre CNY street shopping in China town. Will definitely be back next year. The only setback was the Long.... wait
4
Very crowded dim sum restaurant where they bring the food around with carts for you to choose your selections. You can also request things directly from the servers. Besides your traditional dim sum choices, they also have Singaporean Carrot Cake. (For those not in the know, this is not a dessert, nor does it contain carrots, that I could tell). Get a seat by the window to watch the hustle & bustle of Chinatown go by as you stuff yourself silly. Service was on the slower side, but allowed us time to enjoy a relaxed brunch
5
Authentic Dim sum restaurant with waitresses pushing the dim sum trolley, you would feel the same in Hong Kong. Crowded even during lunch which shows how popular and affordable it is.
Strongly recommended!!!
3
It was our second visit, The dim sums were mediocre, nothing special. I remembered they used to be better especially the egg tarts. It is conveniently open all day for dim sums though.
4
Great spot for dining in Chinatown. The mango prawn is a must I reckon. Not particularly cozy though.
4
The mango prawn fritters, all sorts of porridge, and scallop dumplings are amazing (along with all the other options.. wasn't disappointed with anything) !!
3
The long queue to get in - including many locals, or at least apparently ethnic Chinese people - suggested good things ahead.When we got to our table, tea and Tiger arrived promptly. We ordered in part off the menu and in part from the trolleys. The steamed offerings were good, the fried were a little bland and boring. The wok-fried spinach (with ginger and garlic) was outstanding.Service was, at its best, patchy. Staff seemed run off their feet, and although we were given menus, it took a long time to flag down someone who could take our order. Likewise, the trolley circuit was erratic, and we had to wait for long periods to get attention (and food).The location in Chinatown is great, and the place itself has a pleasing atmosphere.There are better dim sum elsewhere, but Yum Cha is an institution
5
Was delighted to find that this dimsum restaurant has pushcarts. Rather than ordering from a menu you get to order the old fashioned way from old women pushing the carts of hot dimsum around. This plae looks like a blast from the past -- like the dimsum restaurants I remember when I was a chil
3
THE GOOD:Some interesting dim sumCheapTHE NOT SO GOOD:Toilets are disgustingCheung fun blandWe ate here for lunch and the food was okay, nothing special I thought. You need to be aware that if you don't eat peanuts or use the wet towels they will charge you for it.The squid ink dim sum was tasty and was our favourite. Although the cheung fun was very bland and only had two prawns in them. Service was okay, my biggest gripe was the state of the toilets. They were absolutely disgusting. The staff or patrons obviously use it for smoking but not only that, the toilet seat was smeared with brown all over it. Really ruined our visit
5
I enjoyed every visit I had to Yum Cha restaurant. The Dim Sum dishes are not oily nor too salty. I recommend all their steamed dishes and also the custard buns. The Chinese tea served is of good quality too. We spent SGD68 (including service charge and GST) on 12 dishes, a pot of tea and the peanuts/papertowel. The place is very noisy though it seems to bring you back in time to the old days of Singapore, or feels like in Macau dimsum cafes
4
A really great meal in a nice environment, but the service is strange ... we ordered soup, dim sum, main courses, rice and vegetables and every dish was delivered together, all at once within five minutes ... when we asked if they could keep the food hot so we could eat the soup first, we were not accommodated ... when we finished, no one asked if we wanted dessert or if we wanted a check ... we just sat and sat and sat until the entire restaurant cleared and still no one came to the table ... the staff just proceeded cleaning up and ignored us ... it was a wonderful meal but a bizarre experience ... it was not until we asked that we were told to go to the cashier ...

I read something from the Guardian about this place being good so I stopped by here on my trip to Singapore for some dim sum.The food was good, above average even. The Shu Mai were succulent. The bean curd was delicious. I would be giving this place four stars except when I got the bill I noticed they charged me $2 for eating a couple of the little peanuts they put out on the table. They also charged me sixty cents to use the moist towelette on the table. Now maybe this is a cultural thing, but usually if a restaurant puts something out on the table without you asking for it it is a courtesy and you are not charged for it. I was charged nearly as much for a couple of peanuts I thought were free as I was for a dim sum item. This practice feels dishonest and I would recommend the management at Yum Cha discontinues it immediately.I would recommend this place, with the caveat that you shouldn't eat the peanuts and bring your own towelette
5
Busy, friendly environment to eat, with a variety of delicious dishes. The staff are friendly and attentive. Dim sum are excellent
3
Visited the outlet near Expo for lunch today. Quite a busy place, but efficient. We had 6 different servings of dim sum and tea for a price of about $35, which seemed like reasonable value. All tasted pretty good.
5
If you want to have an excellent dim sum meal this is your restaurant. Plan to take your time it truly is an authentic Chinese restaurant we enjoyed over 18 different varieties of food all very good
5
Gd dim sum, value for $ buffet dimsum. Have to ask the staffs to change your table to a cooler location if u r afraid of sweating while enjoying your hot food 😁
4
We were having a group dinner with a friend who just came back from overseas. Friend was craving dim sum so badly. Food and service was really good. However, Yum Cha serves only limited selection of dim sum for dinner. Would be good if there are more dim sum options for dinner
5
We enjoyed the food. They are tasty and above average. Reasonable price too. Good location right in the heart of Chinatown. A little challenging to locate the entrance though.I booked using Chope and it was a breeze. I received confirmation via email almost instantly despite it was late at night and the night before a public holiday. However, the staff at Yum Cha told me that they do not accept booking on public holidays. I was adviced to feedback to Chope. The queue was long at the restaurant and no way I could let my guests wait in the queue. Thankfully the staff was nice to honour the booking. She got one table for us after 10 mins which I was very thankful. I hope Chope can sort out the booking policies with the participating restaurants to prevent such incidents
4
Preference for dim sum in Singapore is Red Star, but we couldn't get a booking, so opted for this place insteadWe also had my relatives in from Hong Kong and so finding a decent dim sum was essentialThe restaurant itself is nothing to write home about, but nevertheless, still very popular - especially with passing tourists wandering through ChinatownWe were a table of 11 and so lots of dishes were being ordered and when the aunties with their dim sum trollies caught on that it was a table of Hong Kongers, they scrambled to show off their dishes, hoping they diners would be impressedThe char siu buns went down well, but my relatives found the portions to be extremely small for the priceHowever, we all left satisfied enoug
5
this long time restaurant on the second floor in Chinatown has terrific dim sum with many options and great tasting dim sum.we went around 3 pm (just as the dim sum all you can eat for high tea was starting) but ordered fewer items off the menu. The choices were varied, tasty, not oily and fun

it stays in 2nd floor of the building on Temple St., China Town. Opening time is from 09:00 am.it's great place for gathering family. their dim sum is delicious, great & deserved with its price.they will not give you any menu, each staff that takes care for some dishes with trolley; will come to your table and asks whether you would like to have dishes -> such a nice experience

When I googled yum cha, this place kept coming up and the reviews were really good. Well I was really shocked that it would be so popular! We queued for a while and even though the restaurant wasn't full, it took a while for someone to take us to a table. We asked for the peanuts to be taken away as didn't want to be charged for something we didn't want. After all, we wanted to save room for delicious dim sum! Well what a disappointment, in a nutshell, they weren't super hot, the dumplings were bland and tasteless and I have had far better in other countries! The restaurant is also really noisy due to the wooden flooring, and we will never return. Din Tai Fung is far cleaner, better service and their dumplings are far more delicious!

Dim Sum is the best in Chinatown comparing with other famous restaurant. Price is not that expensive. Better try this shop!
3
If you'd like a taste of Chinese Dim Sum, try out Yum Cha in Chinatown when you do visit there. You get a good spread of Dim Sum spread on push carts. The quality isn't the best, but it's a good sample spread taste test.
4
Authentic Cuisine at affordable prices. very good ventilation. with so many choices from ducks to pork to chili crabs.
4
Dumplings etc were good and service was very attentive. We were there with our 9-month old twins and the staff were fantastic with them.
5
Probably the best dim sum in my admittedly limited experience. I like that its a little hidden, up some stairs and around a corner (though not hard to find), making it feel like a respite from the busy touristy street below. There was a healthy mix of tourists and locals, and no question as to the authenticity. Prices are very reasonable. Service is a little business-like, but not unfriendly and frankly that seems the norm at dim sum places.
5
Head upstairs in the heart of Chinatown to probably the best Dim Sum house in Singapore. Full of character and served with traditional trolleys. The food is delicious and varied with a few items that you might not have seen elsewhere - such as the squid ink dumplings. The yam dumplings, Cheung Fun and Char Sui Bau are traditional favourites. It is hard to go wrong
4
I first came here 10+ years ago when the place still had ceiling fans, now replaced by air conditioning, but no matter when or what, the food has maintained consistency. I have been several times now, but I have only just reviewed it.Dim sum dishes are plentiful. We also ordered a fish and on occasion I have watched my friends order chilli crab. The food service is very fast - he kitchen must be efficient.It is the sort of place that the locals go to, so give it a try. I am sure you will like the place
5
A friend of mine had recommended this restaurant as a good lunchtime venue and he was certainly correct. It is on a corner location and two stories up via escalator. Not too busy when we arrived about 12.30pm. Huge choice of dishes on menu. You just mark on the menu how many portions of each dish you require and the waiter then collects. All the dishes were freshly cooked and served without delay. Great value for money, for a change, in this rather expensive city
4
This is like a classic old school dim sum restaurant. Yes if they give u clean wipes and pickles/ nuts they will charge u for them but this is quite normal. The Ha Kow was very good. The chicken Wings in a bag were too oily for me. The cheung fan with prawns was average but not bad. Overall I give this place a 4 and was glad I tried i
4
This restaurant is located on the second floor in chinatown area. The restaurant is spaces and bright. Usually crowded during lunch time. Very traditionally decorated to give you a feel of the old times. The food is considered reasonably priced compared to restaurants in the prime area like orchard road. Food is good. I ordered steam "char siu" rice rolls, fried glutinous rice, steam char siu bun, deep fried yam, fried silver fish etc
4
We visit Yum cha reataurant at Chinatown, It's on second floor, a big place with many tables. Many custom are a long queue, should be booking before. Dim sum food has excellent menu, many kind of stream food, fried food and dessert with egg tart.
5
Average food and reasonably priced Place a bit drabby, could do with some refurbishment and upgrade of the whole area.
4
We liked the food! Prices were reasonable, service friendly. Good place to go when looking for dim sum. If you want to get a table for sure, make a reservation!
5
Visited hear for dim sum while shopping after being highly recommended and it surely never disappointed. Even though we arrived close to closing time the food quality was great and the service was good also. Priced decently and surely not too expensive. If your around the area I would definitely recommend this place. A must visit! #amit1chaha

Our visiting Australian is crazy on Yum Chas but only likes the ones that has trolley service. Yum Cha Restaurant in China town is one such place that offers a trolley service but only on weekends. we got there about `215 in the afternoon and the wait was about 15 mins. once we got a table the trolleys were there and it seemed as though they were in a hurry to get you out as soon as possible. all up the quality of the Yum Cha was good and there were a few items not seen on the traditional Yum cha menu. all up very good and $15 corkage fee for a bottle of wine was not to bad. will go again
5
Yum Cha serves a variety of dim sum. Trolleys roll by frequently for you to make a choice. Or you can place an order. Service is quick. There are always queues, but it moves quickly. If you are trying dim sum for the first time, read up a bit on it so you know what you are ordering. We go often, never been disappointed.

We found that place because of the "Singapore Restaurant Month", where they were supposed to have a special dish, celebrating Singapore's 50 years of independence. Upon arriving, we stood there, waiting to be seated, as it is usual around the city. At least half a dozen waitresses passed us by and none of them even care to address us or even nod. Since the restaurant was not so full, we decided to get a table on our own. Little we know, the bad service was just starting to show.The special dish was in a separate menu over the table, so we decided to order it. The waiter simply told us that we could only order it after 6PM, even though there was absolutely no such information on the website or even at the menu. We then decide to move to the dim sums, as they are supposed to be the house specialty. Granted, some of them were good, but most of them were too greasy, even those that were supposed to be stir fried.The place itself it's also not very clean (on our way out we noticed it received a 'B' grade from hygiene inspectors, which is below many food stalls).Bottom line, if you want a good dim sum around town, you'll be better off with Dim Tai Fung. It's more expensive, but it's also on a completely different level
4
This restaurant specialises in dim sum. We were advised to come to this place by family. We were told to expect to wait for table as it's always busy, we awaited approx 10 minutes for a table of 8. The way it works is each table has a list of all the food and drinks available and the food is cooked to go, some ladies bring the food round as it's cooked and you have to tell them what you want off the trolley and they write down how many you've hadn't the card, at the end of the meal you take the card to the till and pa for what you have eaten. You have to be patient because the trolley goes around the whole restaurant. You can order specific foods that aren't on trolleys and the waiter will order it to be cooked (again please be patient) it's not a quick service but the food is absolutely amazing! I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the area!
2
Be careful when you dine here. What we thought was a small dish of complimentary peanuts,($2.00!!), and hand wipes, (60cents each),were added to our bill! And a teapot of tea was $3.60!!!Dishes were cheap $2.50-$4.80, but service was terrible. We were given a menu, pencil and ordering sheet to fill out. Food tasted stale. No sign of authentic dishes, eg chicken feet or beef tripe, or porridge, or veggies. Still looking for authentic yum Cha in Singapore
4
The decor is nothing special and I've seen greater variety of Dim Sum selection, however the six Dim Sum dishes we ordered were very fresh and tasty, the price was okay - not too cheap (about 5 SGD per steam basket) but fine for what we got for the money. Staff seemed busy even though the restaurant was only half full, but were helpful when we needed anything
4
staff were very busy and had no time to attend to us.
the aircon was not strong enough, especially for a hot and humid afternoon.
5
One of the best Yum Cha's i have had, great food and service. Well priced and good variety of dishes. really easy and fresh.
4
One of the most delicious dim sun restaurant in Singapore. But you must be careful about the price which does not include 10% service charge, 7% government tax, towel and peanuts on the table.
2
service poor attitude whereas food were not that fresh
ordering was a long awaiting process
prices were not reasonable
4
Recommended to me by a taxi driver. The restaurant can be difficult to find- the sign is a teapot and upstairs.
Only had the dim sum which was good and hot, service fairly average and prices OK
1
We decided we'd like an air conditioned seafood restaurant for my infants comfort and to enjoy a night out with my hubby and the in laws... Upon arrival you are directed to the table, no smiles.. Sit and be prepared to be yelled at. Staff are extremely rude, but they do attend to the table... The way they express them themselves is rather aggressive... Anyway...We ordered a few of their signature dishes... Peking duck is a waste of money, duck was dry, pancakes tiny! Waste of stomach space. We ordered a beef dish, ohhhhhh that was the toughest and piece of meat ever. The other thing that disturbs me whilst try to eat my meal is the constant staring by all staff members .Awkward night out, in terms of food, I would never recommend this to anyone I know. It's not cheap either

Came for dimsum but was shocked with waitress foul attitude. Her tone of voice was haughty as though there's no other restaurants we could go for dimsums. We could anytime go to Yan Ting, Peach Blossom, Summer Palace, Asia Grand, Royal China or Spring Court & be welcomed witb open arms & hearty smiles. Even the captain Simon couldnt care less whenever we gave feedbacks to him, he is too aloof as though he was indispensable. Silver Fish had deteriorated a lot over the years, soggy with oil. The skin of Har Kao is thicker than before & hard. Siu Mai had so much fatty pork. Worst of all was the century egg porridge which had only one tiny wee 5mm bit size of century egg & the rest was plain congee. Seriously, this is daylight robbery. Service was lousy & food was terrible yet management was never bothered with customers' constructive feedbacks. Only one chinese female waitress did a great job as she was pleasant, efficient, caring & helpful to our needs. After supporting Yum Cha Gardens since it first opened in Serangoon Gardens, it kicked off with fanfare for 3 years then continually deteriorating till today. Would i recommend, "no way" bcos i dont want to lose my reputation for such lousy food & lousy service
4
We really wanted dumplings, this was recommended by the hotel. It had an address of Trengganu street in Chinatown, but it is actually around the corner on Smith street, upstairs. Great food, attentive service, OMG the garlic on the garlic prawns.....there was a lot. Lovely dumplings
4
If you want good Yum Cha without the tourist trimmings - this is for you. Set up a long flight of stairs, hidden amongst China Town shops - well worth the fine. You will get a good feed here of quality local food without the grandeur.Basic seating, restaurant has no view but is cool. Service is ok - but the food is why you are here and it delivers.Would definitely be back
5
Yum Cha is located in China Town Singapore, which is the place is less noticeable. But they served the best dim sum I ever taste. The LoMaKay (sticky rice with pork meat and salted egg, wrapped with lotus leaf) is the best ever. The Shu May also good. They also served the various soup menu and also porridgeLittle bit pricey, but totally worthed
1
Do not bother to come here. Drives you crazy.
The food is not fresh. There is no one that speaks English well. Frustrating. If you sit further in the restaurant, the food trolley never comes to you.
4
This restaurant was a little hard to find. We passed the entrance and had to back track to find it. . . maybe it's just us. We were there before 11:00 and the place was packed. Really enjoyed the dim sum that they brought around with the carts. I can't speak Chinese but the ladies were nice enough to show me all the different dishes she was carrying. I like to eat my dim sum with some soy sauce but there isn't any on the table. Just ask the server and they will give you a small dish.
2
We went there for dinner and all the food we had was pretty poor, especially the dim sum and the flat rice pancakes, which were impossible to eat. We ordered some glazed beef and the taste wasn't bad but quite tough. The Peking duck was good, though pancakes had a different taste from others I've tried elsewhere. Service was quite annoying because the waiters kept coming every 2 seconds to pour more tea, even if we'd only taken a sip
3
Food was served quite fast. Whole restaurant is not that big and currently there is 10% discount for NTUC member for weekend. I would not say that the food is that fantastic. Those fried items were very oily and fried carrot cake is the best. One of the unique item is the squid ink dumpling which is worth trying
5
Found the restaurant when in China town,my friend ordered and what a fabulous Dim Sum lunch we had. Was introduced to some really different food.The menu was large ,food was hot in temperature ,good service,friendly and typical Chinese atmosphere,thoroughly enjoyed the experience.Restaurant was busy with Chinese and Europeans.What a treat and will definitely go back on my next visit.The Singapore noodles were wonderful which is one of my favourites and a huge portion.It certainly was worth it
4
We took the Singapore Chinatown By Night tour and one of the stops was for a meal at "Yum Cha". What a brilliant, yet simple, meal. There were 12 on the tour and we were seated at two tables with 6 on each. We love Chinese food and it was really good in a way that everyone could enjoy. The way the locals were tucking in to their food showed that they were enjoying their experience too. It looked like it would be a great place to eat at any time. The only problem was that we were kept waiting, on of the party spent too much time in the markets!!
2
This restaurant had been recommended , but unfortunately we were not impressed. The restaurant lacked atmosphere and the food, admittedly not dim sum was only average at best. We had looked forward to a meal in Chinatown, but left unimpressed. We also felt that the food was over priced
4
Really decent quality dim sum without the usual surly waitress service. Nice to be able to watch through a window into a prep area where they make the dumplings etc. High quality but pricey with it and a bit put off by the coach parties of well-heeled tourists.
5
We had lunch at Yum Cha and tried a variety of dishes. Without exception the dishes came to the table hot, freshly prepared and were tasty.The service was efficient and empty dishes were cleared from our table promptly.One of the best Dim Sum i have had anywhere in the world, but overall quite expensive
2
The staff who served us were unequivocally non-chalent about taking orders. They were only interested in quickly unloading those already cooked and being put on trolleys. They were rude at best.Some of the dim sum was good, but some were tasteless. The fried dishes were cold. I rather spend less at restaurants like crystal jade/ding tai feng and get better food
4
We were in Singapore for a brief stopover, and had found details in guidebook. It was a little had to find, given all the stalls in Trengganu street. We were not sure we had the right place but several businessmen and other locals went past us in rapid succession, obviously intent on a quick lunch. We were seated quickly, in a sparsely decorated restaurant. The waitress was a little gruff, but attentive nonetheless and she warmed up over our lunch. Although she had little English, she pointed out an additional dish we may not have tried, the bean curd and shrimp dumplings. We ordered from the menu, and ordered a variety of dishes, including BBQ pork bun, chilled baby octopus in sesame, crispy wonton, steamed pork in garlic and chilli, prawn and wood ear fungus dumplings, and our favourite, mango prawn fritters with sesame. She also understood when we ordered just one small plate of fried carrot cake (3 pieces) between 6 of us, and offered to cut it in smaller portions so we could all satisfy our curiosity. We reordered three dishes because they were so good, but then we were struggling to finish it off. The almond tea was lovely, but some of our party ordered beer. We agreed it was the best yum cha we had eaten in 20 years. The bill came to around $30 singapore per head, but understand we ate a lot! Happy to recommend, but you really don't need to try the fried carrot cake. Everything else was excellent.
4
Excellent dim sums with some good varieties - particularly for someone like me visiting from the UK. Be prepared to wait in a queue on the weekends but it is worth the wait and the line moves fast. Essentially the restaurant serves dim sums on a trolley and one just picks their selection. Had some different varieties like squid ink dim sums which were delicious! The pastry around the dim sums was thin and well made.Service was no different than any other average Chinese restaurant.All in all worth a visit on the weekends..
4
@TheKuoKnowsYum Cha is not the easiest restaurant to find. But do persevere. It is really worth the bother, especially if you enjoy stepping back in time into a piece of old Singapore as much as I do.Yum Cha does away with many of the frills that other dim-sum eateries spend inordinate amounts of money on. So, don't expect plush decor and comfy seats. It is functional rather than fancy.The service is pared back to the bare minimum too. But that's ok. It's the food that counts. And the food is wholesomely good.The Char Siu Baos are some of the best I have had - big and fluffy and full of fillings. The Har Gau are generously size and the Cheung Fun are thin and delicate.Do leave some room at the end of the meal for a sumptious egg tart - that is if you can stop at just one. I couldn't
3
My husband and I visited with my brother-in-law and his partner just before Chinese New Year. We had the Hi Tea Buffet.The staff were attentive (but there was hardly anyone in the restaurant anyway). The food was pretty average. I have definitely had better dim sum in other restaurants/countries I have visited and unless you eat absolutely masses the buffet is not brilliant value for money. If you visit you will need to make a decision based on how many big eaters are in your party.I am not a big fish eater. We asked if there was any fish in the steamed carrot cake with cai poh and were told no. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted and I'm guessing from the taste that cai poh is a fish!It was an experience and we enjoyed some of the dishes - particularly the fried chicken in Thai sauce, baked mini egg tarts and chilled mango pudding
1
We had lunch at Yum Cha today and every waitress treated us so rudely! Pouring the tea spilling it everywhere, grabbing the plates before we were finished eating - unacceptably rude behaviour when we brought an out of town guest with us. We will never return!! Your food is not that great to put up with this insulting behaviour !
3
Visited Jan 2015 during our Chinatown Night Tour. We had a fixed dinner, starting with herbal rose tea, which was nothing more than rose scented hot water in a kettle. The other items in our dinner menu was ok. Though it was included in our Chinatown tour, the quality and quantity was not fulfilling. But we had a good tour team and we enjoyed our time throughout the tour and this place gave us a chance to sit and talk with each other. The restaurant was somewhat crowded with lots of locals and tourists and it was surely understaffed. Our server picked up our dishes couple of times before we even finish our food, which was not good. Didn't had a chance to order other items from the menu as it was a fixed meal. Lots of other eateries in Chinatown, so this can be skipped unless you're in a tour which includes dinner here
4
For those who are unsure about eating off the hawker street stalls, Yum Cha is a gem in the middle of Chinatown. We tried the afternoon Dimsum Buffet and left completely satisfied. The staff were polite and helpful as we explored the unfamiliar menu and ordering routine. Going in a group of four meant that we were able to sample a broad range of what was on offer with no left overs - note that the restaurant has an excellent policy for the buffet of charging for wasteage. The key to the buffet is to order little and often to make sure that your eyes don't exceed you stomach! The dimsum arrived freshly prepared and with little delay. We would advise others to arrive earlier in the afternoon - we came at 16.30 which left us a little tight for the 17.30 ordering curfew - and take your time to enjoy the buffet to its full extent. Do leave enough space for the excellent deserts we especially enjoyed the custard tarts and mango pudding though the almond tea was a pleasant surprise. For non fish eaters - avoid the steamed white carrot cake - it's VERY fishy. The lavender and coconut steamed balls would also be better saved for desert. If you are not hearty eaters then consider ordering a la carte as the reasonable prices may be better value than the buffet. We found the restaurant to be well signposted despite the extra street activity of Chinese new year - signage was clear if you looked up while walking along
5
I travel for Dimsum and have loved other dimsum such as the one in NYC China Town and SF's China Town. I can compare their siomai (pork and shrimp) texture, flavor to both. Its so good we order quite a bit of it. You can't go wrong. Eat with your eyes and then try everything
4
This restaurant was very popular the staff were attentive and service was quick. Recommend the BBQ Pork Bun, Shark's Fin with Meat Dumpling. The Prawn & Mango sesame Fritters were different but nice.BBQ Pork Flour Roll again never had them before but OK. Shredded Chicken Congee were very good and for desert we had Crispy Red Bean with Banana were also very nice. Would recommend this restaurant
4
it is in china town, a bit diffiult to find the entrance, specially during Chines New Year with so many stalls. but it is good place for dimsums . They still go around the restaurant with trolleys showing off the food. So jut pick inside the bamboo box and choose what you fancy most. very reasonable priced, Quality is fine but not the fine dinning level.No reservation on saturday or sunday. Just send an advance person to start the queue. Nice place for a family gathering or with friends
4
Long queue but worth it. Good place with great taste for dim sum. Fast service/serving. Will be back again when visit SG.
2
Overall this one deserves sad applause, winning no category of service, quality. Cost, taste or ambience. The place is hidden in Chinatown and gives somewhat of an impression that you might find a gem located in the hustle of it all. So up a narrow staircase and excitement brews but alas a big hall, no music and bold bright light. We enter and get pointed to a table fairly promptly and were thinking "the food should be good since there are a lot of review of the place that speaks to it". So we rush to call for menus and order too much so we can give a whole bunch of things a try.First comes the vegetables. Vegetarian they say and sprinkled with the usual dose of unnecessary shrimp. Next the fried rice then dumplings etc. dish after dish waiting for something to write home to. Unfortunate I can't say a single one. The service was fairly prompt but never with a smile. The price...hefty for Chinatown. I would carefully reconsider if you want to go here. It's simply not worth it and there are far far better options in Chinatown. Skip it and save yourself the attempt to prove me wrong.
5
If you are looking for a dim sum type experience and you look at the time and think " missed it", do not despair. Yum Cha has their version of a high tea dim sum (no carts, just a menu with pics) from 3-6pm, but you must arrive by 5 or they will tell you its last order before you order anything! All the food is delicious, shrimp and mango rolls, paper chicken wings, custard buns, you name it and it is made to perfection.As is the case in many Chinatown eateries , the service can be gruff and dismissive but for me that's all part of the charm.You will find this place upstairs, try to get a table by the window and watch the Chinatown chaos go on below you while you enjoy perfectly cooked food and deliciously hot Jasmine tea
4
We didn't have to wait for too long to be seated. They gave us Chinese menu and never came back for the order. We didn't know the waitors would come with dim sum trolley. We just had to point and speak. But our table was in the corner where the waitors didn't seem to notice we were there. A bit unorganized service, ortherwise, great variety of delicious food
5
very traditional and typical Singaporean Dim sum, cozy atmosphere,traditional ambience, amazing and very helpful staff.Cook very well presented and cooked to perfection,Located right in the middle of Chinatown on a second floor corner.The place is a little difficult to find because of all the little stores lining up the alleyway, once you find it and go up the stairs the place opens up to a pretty nice dining room, very cozy and warm.Will definitely visit again on my next trip
4
You get a very comfortable dining experience with the no-frills dim sum spread against a very cozy ambiance, notably the marble tables and classic wooden seats i.e. very typical Singaporean style. I like their har gows and siew mais, which is consistently tasty and good. Their porridge is also worth mentioning cooked to the right texture. As for dessert, make sure you try their banana pancake
4
When in Chinatown this is a great option for Dim Sum. Whilst it is in the heart of Chinatown it is a little hard to find the first time as its on the first floor and the entrance is not particularly well signposted. We thoroughly enjoyed Yum Cha and visited it several times when in Singapore. Staff are friendly and the food was delicious.
4
Good to be back after many years and see things are still mostly the same. The dim sum still being carted along the aisles which has disappeared from so many restaurants in Bangkok, Singapore, and Hongkong as was commonplace before. The quality is good to very good.I especially enjoyed the chicken wings in paper bag, steamed sticky riceParcels, and the hargao dumplings. Good, fast service and very reasonable
4
VIsited Yum Cha numerous times and think they deserve a good review after my visit this afternoonLocation - easily accessible via train/bus as it is in the heart of Chinatown. its on 2nd floor of the hotelFood - tried both dim sum in the morning/noon as well as Chinese dinner in the evening. Good quality, and fresh. Most important - food is served piping hot. If you are on dim sum go int he morning/noon as the selection of dim sum is less on dinner session. typical fare like char siew bao, prawn dumpling, siew mai are very good.Service - very good - i love the fact that a lot of staff are middle age but still very enthusiastic and friendly.Pricing - not the cheapest in Chinatown if you compare to Tak Po, but that is a complete ballgame all together.tips : - do not be tempted to order everything in 1 go no matter how big is your group. order 1st round a few items, see what you like and order again! then you get to enjoy piping hot dim sum rather than a table-full of lukewarm dim sum. - Remember to enjoy your dim sum with a pot of hot Chinese tea.- do not be intimidated by the menu that looks very extensive especially if you are new to dim sum. there is no right or wrong way to enjoy the good Chinese meal
5
Above the Santa Teresa Hotel, there is a lift if stairs aren't good for you! You either arrive early for lunch or dinner, or you will need to queue. I hate queues, but we did on our second visit because I knew what was coming. Yum Cha is frequented by locals too.... That is what I always look for! There are pictures and descriptions of every option and all you do is fill in your menu card and the food arrives. The food itself is amazing!Great place to be adventurous in your food selections and for us, we learnt more about how to blend flavours. This is a place we are still talking about and a friend is armed with the address for his visit in the New Year. TIP...... Get there about 1130 or slightly earlier for lunch if you do not like to wait and go armed with accurate directions
3
Eficient and friendly service. Good variety of dim sum. Tasty but not surprising. A place where local chinese families go. Over all an interesting experience. Advisable to arrive early as lines can be long.
4
Almost all the dim-sum served are delicious, steamingly hot & in perfectly big sizes.
Lots of varieties which included Chinese noodles, fried rice, seafood and hot & cold Chinese dessert.
4
My friends and I visited for lunch. We choose a la carte so we filled in the order form and all our selections were brought to us. The lavender coconut dumpling was AMAZING! Prompt service and reasonably priced esp for Singapore.
5
Worth the wait. Went there with family for Sunday Lunch...line to get in or get a table is long. best to get a reservation instead.
2
We dined here recently as part of a group tour of China Town , the food was served promptly, but sadly very bland tasting , in fairness it was set menu and not really to my normal choice .
4
People say that this is arguably the best dimsum in Singapore. Nice tradtional shophouse atmosphere, fresh dumplings, easily accessible by train, and in the heart of Chinatown. Great value for money as part of the Singapore experience.
5
It's in the Chinatown, you can experience the old Chinese dim sum restaurant. Food selection is excellent, taste is good and price is reasonable.
4
We frequently go to Yum Cha for dim sum on a weekend either to dine in the restaurant or get take away. Efficient service and amazing dumplings and, for those who struggle finding vegetables that aren't swimming in oil in the food centres in Singapore, the broccoli is great!
4
meals are served in the nice location in a Shophouse in the middle of Chinatown - if you do not have the exact location, the restaurant is a little hard to find! Great food...not very very cheap, but very reasonable. Service....well, Singapore like most of the times! Still a place I would send people to go to and enjoy...top tip: dessert: Glutinous rice balls in a Ginger Tea. A must try...!!
2
Don't waste your time and money here. Limited selection, poor flavour, very very average. The dim sum you can buy frozen and steam yourself is better than this.On the plus side the service is pretty good, waitress was very attentive and kept my tea topped up.
4
Get there early and great for a Sunday lunch. It is queue and wait and well worth the effort. Reasonably priced for good dim sum and sufficient through put of people not to be stale.
4
Went there to try their Dim Sum Buffet after spend the morning at River Safari.. Was overwhelmed by the variety of delicious dim sums and we enjoyed it.
4
Enjoyed this restaurant as we went there on a tour then returned on our own. It was good value and the kids loved it
5
Filled with locals and has a great atmosphere, service was great and the food was fantastic, definitely recommend getting the first dumplings on the menu. A must to dine in singapore!
4
Right in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha has the atmosphere revered by locals and tourists alike. It's always packed at lunch hour which ensures freshly baked dumplings by the minute. The crunchy banana& bean paste deep fried dumpling is the best way to finish a large selection of dim sums. And the top it all it's not expensive, always a bonus
4
I heard quite a lot about this restaurant and always wanted to try it but didn't have the chance until very recently.Yum Cha, literally means, 'Drink Tea' in Chinese also means to having Chinese tea and dim sum. Dim Sum, small Chinese dishes. Think of it like servings of individual bites, in small portions.The location of the restaurant, in the middle of Singapore's Chinatown, adds to the allure of this place.The Dim Sum were had are surprisingly good, the portions just nice. Yum Cha does not skim on the ingredients and we could find whole pieces of shrimps, for example, in our Har Kow (Prawn Dumplings) and Prawn Chee Cheong Fun (Steamed Prawns in Rice Rolls). The fried carrot cake was very crispy and still soft to bite. Overall, I like the food and the price.However, the only dish I find not well done was the Prawn Chee Cheong Fun which I felt had too much oil and not enough of the light soy sauce.It is a very popular restaurant and do expect to queue for a while if you are going during the busy times of lunch and dinner

You can tell a good restaurant when it is used by locals and this one was packed. We didn't have to wait too long and it was well worth the wait, food was delicious and the sweet and sour fish was excellent. The staff work hard and are polite and served the dishes without delay. A good place to eat

I was recommended this from a friend, it's near the Santa Ana Grande hotel. Went around 9:30am on a Sunday morning.Meal wasn't overly expensive, and lots to choose from: either hot or cold options. Custard bun was good but be careful or it can pop open and you'll have custard sauce all over the table (or you!). Try a little of a few things and you can order more of the same if you like it. Good service, rarely have to wait long for them to come around again. It wasn't overly crowded yet so that was helpful.Depending on which direction you come from, it can be difficult to find the entrance, and you have to take stairs or elevator to 2nd floor to the restaurant

I got this restaurant recommended by a local friend and went twice during a one week visit to Singapore. Yum Cha Restaurant is located in the heart of China Town. Both times I had a great dining experience, but I must say I enjoyed the second most, as it had a different set-up. First time I visited the restaurant on a late Sunday afternoon and we were served from a menu. The second time I visited it on a Saturday during lunch time and servers were passing by pushing trolleys with different dumpling you could choose from. Loved the fact you could actually see how the dumpling look like before choosing. The restaurant was both times packed with locals and expect to wait for a table, specially during lunch time.

I went to Yum Cha with friends while visiting Singapore at the end of June. The dim sum was good but I have had better, and overpriced for what it was. It was nice to see the place filled with locals, and our service was good. This place seems to be highly recommended to tourists but I believe there is better dim sum to be had in Singapore
4
Nice place, quite hard to find, lost in the middle of the shops. But very goog food, decent and precise service. The dim sums are creative and awake curiosity and awoke my tatse buds very nicely. Spice is present but not invading.
3
Enjoyed the timsum. But in terms of service, it has a lot to be done. Atmosphere can be further improve too.
3
Strategic location in Chinatown, nice name for a restaurant too. The dim sum was nice and the food tasted good. The staff were not as friendly though. Sure it's a crowded restaurant, but smiling when you take someones order makes a difference.
5
Whilst I had been warned that the service could be inconsistent but the food would be very tasty, I was disappointed on one front - the service. Both the food and the service were of the highest quality on the day we visited. Highly recommend you go early though
2
Came here for lunch with my mum and ordered the usual dim sum items like har gow and siew Mai.Sad to say that the standard has dropped. Skin of har gow was one of the thickest I've tried. Taste of the other items are average and pretty saltish.Guess this may be the last time I visit this place considering that there are just too many dim sum joints in Singapore
5
The food was some of the best Chinese food I have had. Located in the heart of Chinatown, Yum Cha handled our large group very well. The food came out hot and was clearly well prepared. It tasted fresh and was nicely spiced. They were sensitive to folks' allergies and food preferences
4
In the middle of Chinatown Singapore, up an old staircase is still one of the best Yum Cha/dim sum restaurants in town. I have no hesitation in taking visitors here and going there myself for my favourites. In a town where prices are going through the roof, this is great value for money. Nice mix of shoppers, tourists and locals
1
Had such a terrible dinner here I eat a lot of Chinese food all over the world and this by far is the worst I have ever had.The waitresses were so rude and never explained what the food was when they put it down,had to ask for soya sauce. We were on a china town tour.The staff just stand there and stare at you like your a criminal,they refuse to remove dishes it was getting pretty crowded with 8 people at the table. Also when leaving one of the people apart of our group went to the bathroom and on her return her camera had been stolen by a staff member. This is terrible and leaves a bad taste in your mouth for the rest of the tour.I would never eat here again due to the lack of service and rudeness.
4
Really nice, freshly cooked dim sum in authentic surroundings. No complaints, we visit here once or twice each year and it's consistently good but why oh why do they add on for a tiny bowl of peanuts on the table and for the service totes, 2.00 peanuts and 60 cents for each serviette. No big deal just silly. In addition to the dim sum menu we always ask for a bowl of plain rice which is great value at 1 dollar so we shall continue to visit
4
Just had a Saturday lunch here with my son, his partner and my grand daughter and we all enjoyed the food.Trollies full of delicious steaming dim sum calling at our table every few minutes and it was a mighty effort demolishing the food fast enough so we could order refills!Good family atmosphere here and heaving with all sorts of people, the staff certainly weren't unfriendly, just extremely busy.The restaurant is situated at 20 Trengganu St in Chinatown amidst many other Chinese restaurants and a very short walk from Chinatown MRT.We ate plenty at the bill came to 72 Singapore Dollars
3
The dim sum was nice I had (dinner), but charging for the peanuts on the table, charging for the wet towels, leave a Chinese rip off aftertaste..
4
Yum Cha Restaurant is on 2Floor in Santa Grand Hotel China Town. Dim Sum and congee is delicious but this restaurant don't have English menu.
4
Solid Dim Sum place in Singapore. Not the best dim sum I've ever eaten in my life, quite good nevertheless. If you're a fan, you'd probably like it.
4
Situated along Trengganu Street, it is around 5min walk from Chinatown MRT. Used to be quite small, it has now expanded so it was crowded (cos food was nice). It now seems to be partner of a hotel (same lift as Santa Grand Hotel). Service was not that great but that's to be expected. Dimsum was fresh and tasted good. Typical steamed ones would be around SGD4 (eg a basket of 4 siew mai/prawn dumpling SGD3.80; Lo Mai Kai SGD3.80). They have several types of chinese tea.Overall, very nice food
3
As other reviewers have said this restaurant is not so easy to find. After visiting this place it seems it is targeting the locals. Menu all Chinese, as we were leaving we got an English menu - handy!! Food quite good, plenty of choice and fresh. But didn't have any wow factor at all
2
The location is good for visitors not knowing very little about Chinese food & culture. People who really like Chinese food would easily find better offerings elsewhere in a lot of food courts and eateries. Service was good though. Definitely not a suitable choice to bring your friends or guests, unless you are really very very hungry and happen to be nearby
2
Located right in the heart China Town, this is a great location to bring visitors for a Dim Sum breakfast, but do not expect to be serviced, even though they charge 10% service fees. And be prepared for the noise and crowd of hungry (angry) people - on Sunday morning! We waited for more than 15 minutes without any dim sum trolly passing by, we indicated to the staff three times that we would like to have some dim sum. Unfortunately, all three of them ignore our requests separately. Everyone seems too busy to care or to talk to customers. Finally, after 20 minutes (it seems much longer when you are hungry), one of the trollies with steamed Dim Sum stop by. The lady in-charged of the trolly was attending to two other customers appeared from nowhere, despite acknowledging our existence. We literately have to 'fight' for her attention. There was no vinegar, ginger and soya sauce on the table, we have to grab it elsewhere ourselves. Another interesting thing is being charged for pickle or peanut which was not on the table, and we did not order. We paid S$22 per head for a stressful Sunday morning breakfast. I used to like the food here, but I will give it a miss after this torturious experience
3
We went to this restaurant as my friend is a dumpling fan - so it that is you then you will love it. A couple of us who are not so partial to the white saggy testicle like sacks will be disappointed as there was not much else on offer
3
The dim sum here is decent. I live in New York City where there are several good dim sum restaurants. Yum Cha compares to them.I did appreciate the menu separating the steamed dishes from the fried dishes. The restrooms need to be cleaned. Service is fine
4
I liked the big selection of different snacks that you can choose from. I disliked the tea they served. I expect better quality tea leaves in a "Yum Cha Place". After all, the authentic Yum Cha is having "tea drinking" as the core of the enjoyment, supported by snacks of different kinds.
1
Me and my family had to wait for very long. Toilet is dirty, the supervisor is rude and generally i will not come back again
4
It is great this restaurant. The dim sum is delicious. After 3:00pm they have open buffet with a lot of different choices. The decoration is very nice and cozy.
5
We took Roasted duck for four persons here and we love it much. they made us full after order a lot of foods. Good taste.
4
Good variety of authentic Chinese yum cha
I went there with a friend
The only problem is that is a little bit disorganized service
Expect to wait to be seated for approx 15-20 min
4
Don't really need to say anything else except ......don't miss eating here when in Singapore. The food is fantastic.
4
There are several dim sum restaurants in Chinatown - this one stands out for several reasons.1. Ambience is the best of the lot, with the look and feel of a classy Chinese restaurant.2. It attracts the most tourists. Expect long queues during peak hours esp. Weekends.Dim sum is generally good - standout dishes being the fried glutinous rice, custard dumpling and steamed beef balls.Prices have been steadily increasing and a dim sum meal for two should be about $40-$50 now.Service can be compromised on peak days with urgency to clear the queue as quickly as possible
3
I visited this restaurant upon recommendation from my taxi driver.i expected a really awesome culinary experience but it was very ordinary.i had prawn wanton which were cold and too appetising, xiao long bao which was already but broke easily not the best and seafood dumplings that were lacking in flavour.i love dim sum so I was disappointed. The meal was reasonable $4 for each choice.it was very Averag
4
This is one of my favorite places for a weekend breakfast of dim sum. I highly recommend you go early (9ish) because the place fills up quickly. The quality of their dim sum is great. The staff are always hustling around to bring the food to the diners. Don't be shy or you'll miss an opportunity for your fave dim sum to go to another diner
4
Yum cha in Chinatown is a must and we stumbled on this restaurant. The entrance can be a bit tricky to find but people will point the way. It was Sunday so very busy and the waitress helped by bringing dishes we pointed to in the menu to our table (although it's more fun to choose from the trolley especially if you have no idea what it is). Some of the dishes are pretty standard but we had a few exceptional ones as well eg the crab and five treasures soup. It was a little pricey as we got stung for extras on the table (peanuts) and we think a ten dollar surcharge. But it was fun
5
We went on a busy Saturday lunch, hence, the relatively long wait. But it was worth the wait.Trolley and trolley of food will pass by your table and It can be intimidating to the uninitiated.Clueless about what to order, just point and ask, and the staff will answer the best they can. Surprise yourself and randomly choose what ever fancies your eye. If you have food allergies, make sure to ask whats inside as there are a number of food with shrimps and crab meat. And, yes, do try the peking duck (if available)
4
Loved the variety of dim sum available. The menu is in Chinese so did not really know what to order. But they bring the dim sum in a trolley and you can pick whatever looks good. It did match the great dim sum I had in Shenzhen (China) some time back. Very authentic. It is not really a fancy restaurant, but gives you a feel of how food is enjoyed in China
3
I was disappointed, to be fair, that the promised trolley service was not available on the Friday we visited: weekends only! The long biao xai was good enough and the mixed seafood in green casing really delicious, but some of dumplings were a bit sticky and hard to extract from the steamer. Disappointed not to have any green vegetables at all so the meal is all a bit stodgy. Service good and friendly and the tea was tasty. Having feasted at the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei, it's a hard act to follow
3
Eating here may be a little intimidating for the non frequent traveller as within 1 minute of sitting down you will be presented with 5 to 7 bowls of food but rear assured this happens to each diner. Be prepared to say No and ask for the menu with pictures and english descriptions.The food was really quite enjoyable and the service was reasonable.There are some odd components though to this place like being billed for nuts that are already on the table and napkins (hand wipe) even though it was only $0.60.Is a real hit with locals though which is always a good sign
5
My GF and I had the lunchtime all you can eat Dim Sum, they have a great trolley (several in fact) and also a la carte, you can pick and choose from both.Staff were very friendly constantly bringing more dishes.Best Dim Sum I've had, including places in China and London!It's tucked away upstairs but quite easy to find.
3
nice place to have your first dim sum experiences.the resturant has the same name as the near by hotel and is a bit hidden behind the shops.the quality and kwantity of the food is good. but it lost its charme and the services is poor
5
Look behind the stalls for the small sign and stairs leading up to Yum Cha. It is better than anything else in the neighborhood. We had the Dim Sum and were very pleased with the quality and quantity. As we sat there we could see other full dinner platters pass by to tables in other rooms that were having full meals. They looked wonderful. Except for the beer the prices were very good. Plan on just one beer or none at all. The tea is a very good alternative both for quality and price
3
We can't make reservation to take dim-sum buffet in Jade of Fullerton Hotel.So we went another famous dim-sum restaurant named "Yum Cha"It is located in temple street of China Town.There's so many people in queue even it's almost end of lunch time.There're many kinds of steamed and fried dim-sum.Most of dim-sum taste good, but service is very poor. We ordered and ordered repeatedly, but our dishes not served fast. So it took so long time to finish our lunch
4
The food is somewhat better than the other chinese places, I've been to. Nice pepper crab, tasty tofu and shiitake... No great lover of chinese food, but this was ok. Service is acceptable, but by no means accomodating. Entrance is in the bach of a store. Look out
5
This was a superb experience in China Town. Look on google maps for location, and its upstairs in a little hotel. There was a fast moving queue, as this place is really popular with the locals. The food was absolutely delicious, and all freshly prepared. Once seated, the ladies come around with a trolley loaded with baskets of dim sum……just choose what you want to eat - get a mixture of baskets. I would avoid the spinach with garlic, as it was a plate of stalks……..they said it didn't come with leaves!!! Ummm!! But all in all, don't go to China Town without paying this little diamond a visit
3
I have mixed feelings about Yum Cha. I ate there two years ago with friends from the US who were working in Singapore. They raved about the best Dim Sum at Yum Cha so we mad our way to Chinatown upstairs to Yum Cha and had a delightful meal.I returned there a month ago and then took my family last week when we visited Chinatown. Its evident that this is a local establishment that continues to serve very good quality dim sum. I would have given Yum Cha a higher rating if their staff had been a little more gracious rather then just efficient and if the atmosphere was a bit warmer however this is my personal opinion based on my past two visits which were quite different than my first time dining there.If you are in Chinatown its worth checking out although a bit challenging to find the entrance in the shopping arcade
4
The Xiao long bao is Excellent, you need to ask for it as it does not make it on to the carts. The dumplings are uniformly very good.
3
The food is good,but the service and the ambience is not good at all. We also got the bill without even asking -I guess, the staff wanted to go home.
1
This is the worst Yum Cha style restaurant I have eaten at in the world. Awful service, awful food and vibe non existent.
Worst meal of my trip this year by far!
4
Visited last may.. We had a great experience.. Recommended place.. I enjoy the food enjoy also the ambience... I hope I can visit this place again in the future
1
We went to this restaurant on 10th August as part of a Chinatown Trishaw Night Tour and it was supposed to be a Chinese Dinner......however it was just a joke...the staff were downright rude, the 4 courses of food were put down all the same time from the soup to the mango pudding...they were reluctant to lift dirty plates away....a table of 9 people and no lazy susan to pass the food around which had been "dumped" on the table with no explanation.....we also had plastic cutlery and the money for the drinks which were not included in the pre paid trip was demanded whilst we were still eating by a sour faced waitress.....the food was pretty awful, it was bland and also cold when it arrived.......I would not recommend this place....I kept waiting on someone jumping out and saying we had been "pranked"...just a joke......
4
Located in the 2nd floor of this shop house in Chinatown, it's one of the traditional style of dim sum service - push carts, a nice touch.Food is very good - everything from Siew Mai, Har Gow, Char Siew Pow, Lo Mai Kai.I personally felt the porridge was average.Try the crav meat soup dumpling, around sgd6.80 per bowl, really nice
4
The dim sum buffet offers good value and selection. The quality was above average as compared to other dim sum outlets out there.Service wasn't the best but I've experienced worse. They do seem short of staff during peak hours, hence, the slower service.As for comments on being charged for napkins, tea and peanuts, from my experience, it seems like a fairly normal practice here for Chinese restaurants. You can opt not to have the peanuts and napkins by returning them if you do not want to pay for them
2
The food was good, my family all agrees with that. but we had to pay for the foods that we didn't even order, and the food came out really late. I think it is because we are foreigners. We also had to pay for peanuts and wet tissue even though they were there at first
1
We been recommend this place by a local guy in the market, the service was very poor, the food average. We were shocked to see the bill- they tryed to charge us $2 for peanuts and $0.80 for each napkins..we refused to pay them for it as they was on the table when we got there and no one told us its not free. I think we got this bad vibe from them only because we not local people
2
Avoid this place if u are Asian .... They don't serve Asian well...we were there sitting at one of tr corner for 10 mins with no one serving us, they kept telling us that dim sum trolleys will come and serve us, but the 2 tables with Caucasians next to us were able to order and they serve the dim sum to their table, well I thought we can do the same but they kept asking us to wait, wait and wait. We asked another waitress if we can order the food instead of waiting the trolley since it took ages for the trolley to serve to the corner we sat, but the other waitress told us to wait too ..... Seem likes this is their management direction n we decided to bring our money somewhere else ..
4
cheap and good. location is very close to the hotel.china town was very fun. but some people do not understand even English. i thought is this Singapore
3
nice food, nice staffm best tastying saudies and ummy burgers tuna was fish but coconut was runny, Squid was tough but waiters nice and chummy.
5
I like the dishes here coz they are delicious and affordable. Like the push carts ladies selling their wares.
4
Very good hrs to do yum cha. Food very good and prices very good. Up on the 1st floor off Temple St. We were given a good recomendation by a local to this restaurant.
3
WE recently went here for a work lunch. you need to get here before 12pm otherwise the queues are huge and on sunday, this restaurant is very popular so get there early. Its very good for basic yum cha/dim sum - steamed dumplings, wantons, spring rolls, rice rolls, congee and rice and noodles. The service is "brisk" and its pretty cheap and cheerful kind of place with less of the "cheap". It is moderately expensive for what it provides
5
This appealing second floor place in Chinatown serves the best dim sum anywhere we have been, including home-base NY, Hong Kong, Hawaii, etc.Everything is cooked to order, as opposed to the cute roving carts often seen. You order yourself, guided by the list which has many photos of items. Wonderful flavors and combination of ingredients such as snow peal leaf/prawn dumplings, prawn asparagus dumplings and many more. Service is efficient if not personable. Ice cold Tiger draught.This is a "must try" aNd definitely worth returning to if you have the time
1
This restaurant was recommended by the hotel (Conrad Centennial) and was also in the DK Eyewitness Travel Book. I asked for a table by the window and they said it was for a larger group; but then they sat two people there. We had a variety of waitresses, all of whom could care less. Ordered a springroll, bok choy, and duck. they first brought the bok choy, much later the spring roll, and fianlly the duck. The quality of the food was good but the service was abominable, and the order of the food was really strange. At the end of the meal when we received the check they charged us for the handiwipes (they never gave us napkins) and for nuts on the table that we never ate. All in all, a big disappointment and really poor service with an attitude
5
I loved this place. The more the merrier! Not the most straight forward way to find the entrance, but clear enough. Once up on the 2nd Floor, you get welcomed by... people queuing! But do not give up, because the turn-over rate is factory-like and you will be seated in no time. I think I waited 10 or 15 min once, but it is worth it! A woman cruise by to note down how many of you will be eating (that's how the queue never stays long enough for you to complain, usually). You get to your table and get served straight away some Jasmine tea, and then either trollies or waitresses zig-zag between tables to present you their freshly steamed or fried dishes. The waitresses then tick the boxes on the receipt that lives on the table. Generally you will end up with a USD 20 note per person, and that is for a full belly! I only tried the Dim Sum and other buns, but it had became my Sunday ritual and I recommend it to whoever stops in Singapore long enough to visit this restaurant.Ho, and please try the mango Sago. It's a liquid mango dish with clear rice beads, and it is soooo refreshing. Do get rebutted by its appearance, and try it
5
We were recommended this restaurant - went for yum cha, steamed dumplings were great, Peking duck pancakes yummy and fried prawn wontons great. Spring rolls only average. Friendly service and a mix of local and western customers. 6 dishes, peanuts and 3 soft drinks cost $S36. Would definately retur
1
From the moment we entered the staff were sour and certainly far from sweet. No help was offered ordering and when the bland dull food arrived we had to ask for bowls which were ceremoniously dumped still stacked on the table, how a place like this exists I do not know, maybe they just don't like foreigners and are happy to rely on local trade, most certainly would never go back or in deed recommend
3
Upstairs in a corner in Chinatown. A mix of Chinese and tourist diners so they are doing something right. The food is good enough. Not amazing but hits the spot. Nothing in Singapore is cheap (except the trains) and this place is no exception.
4
I wrote in my book, BBQ Port Bun - OMG! Perfectly cooked garlic softshell crab. Pan fried pork pancake, really good, fragrant, not like pancake we think of in the states! Great energy at this restaurant. Not supergreat customer service but I would go back.
4
An appetizing light well-seasoned luscious porridge with a delightful aroma which gratify one's gustatory sense
4
Despite the reviews about grumpy staff we were pleasantly surprised and had an enjoyable lunch. Good selection of average quality dim sum in a great location if you're in China town. Staff were helpful and responsive. Get there early to avoid the long queues.
1
Terrible service, food without taste and very rude crew. Be careful! They even charge for the napkins. And if when you sit on the table, they offer you complementary pickles, don't accept it. They will charge you in the end without warning.
4
We have been here a few times now, and have even taken visiting guest here. The dim sum is very good the Xiaolongba are very tasty, as the is the deep fried banana and red bean and the mango pudding. Service is a bit slow though, but we think its worth it
5
An awesome array of yum cha, each one of which was melt in your mouth, from the ink squid dumpling to the mango and prawn roll with sesame, the treasure soup....expertly and accurately appeared on our table. Loved how they were served in the order we had ticked them on the menu so we knew exactly what we were eating. We would have loved to return, but the crowds preparing for Chinese New Year prevented us from reaching it again. BTW there is now a lift as well as the wooden staircase that used to be the only entry.we were lucky not to have to wait when we arrived......there was a huge queue as we left. Only criticism is the two staff who were a little grumpy and need to learn how to smil
3
I had to wait for my eldest daughter to return from Melbourne before visitng Yum Cha again bcos she loves dim sum alot. So, together with my family I bought along my mother to sup before 2013 appears. We found new dishes eg chocolate pretzel sticks which are Pork Springrolls, the very colorful Baked Cheese Seafood tarts & the Chive Dumpling. They are good, give them a try. Our fav & Best dishes are still the Durian dumpling (moochi), Beijing Duck, Crispy Red Bean paste wt Banana pancake, Century Egg congee, siu mai, har kao, phoenix claws, carrot cake, etc. One particular dish that seem to drop standard is the Char Siu chee cheong fun which used to have thinner & softer skin. A standing ovation we would give to is waitress Ms Leong Lai Chee for her excellent service & beautiful waiting attitude. She carried out her duties without any flaws but full of our praises and profesionally done. Our cups were continually filled up without having to remind her at any moment, hats off to her. She cleared our used plates promptly & timely and replenished with new ones efficiently and courteously, everytime with a genuine smile on her face. The climax was when she efficiently served us the Beijing Duck with such promptness. She made our lunch a great JOY indeed. I was very disappointed with the Captain who first attended to us when we stepped in, Ms Zhou Ling despite only 3 tables in the hall at the point we were seated. She seemed to display both in action and vocal tone that she's either serving us out of obligation or out of reluctance. Her physical gestures combined with her facial expresssions and her sarcastic tone of voice when she answered our enquiries or during serving us were congruent to poor service as a Captain. We felt we were not welcomed, if not for Ms Leong & subsequently for Captain Ivy Lim's presence. Halfway through our feasting, Captain Ivy Lim replaced Zhou Ling (we dont know for what reasons). She was bubbly and excited to see us dining as a family. In fact, with her presence she brighten up our dining experience with her resourcefulness and cheerfulness, unlike Zhou Ling's lethargic & unwelcoming body language. Next, is our praises to aunty Ong Ah Choo, who never failed deliver dishes with a good-feeling attitude and genuine smile everytime we dined here, countless times already. This is the real 'unsung heroine' whom many customers take for granted and would never mention good of her to management. Such is the character that made my family want to come back again and again besides the cosy clean ambience, the good food and the correct pricing. One of the very best take away we would buy home is the sambal belachan. Die die must try. My family reckons and votes this to be the very best in the whole of Singapore. Kudos to the chef

We went to this Restarant in a group of about 100 people. It's obviously a very popular Restaurant for Tourists and locals alike, because there was lots of people waiting to get in. Aside from that the food and service is very good. Their speciality is Dim Sum served in typical Cantonese style. We had a fixed menu and all the dishes was very tasty if you like that type of food
4
Yum Cha is a great original Dim Sum restaurant with the old trolley System, serving great assortment of Dim Sumcharging for the extras is typical in Singapore bring yourOwn napkins,,,Lobster is expensive in Singapore food is expensive period.The food is great and the Staff helpfulCome with a good attitude and you walk home with a great experienc
4
the food quality not so bad..tasty too but the dessert still not as good as the one i had at canton-I :) very friendly and helpful people..
4
Quaint and simple with push-carts and noisy environmnt. But food tastes good and good for an informal lunch or tea with friends.
3
Yum Cha is your usual dim sum place. It's pretty good quality, but not exceptional. They didn't have cheong fun when we visited, which was a disappointment.
5
Very good value, full juicy dim sum pieces, innovative too. Love the banana red bean fritter. Also love the various prawn-based dumplings and the noodles are good. I also always use their delivery service. Good food!
1
After reading the reviews of Trip Advisor me and my boyfriend decided to go to Yum Cha Restaurant.What we thought it would be a plesant dinner end it up being a headache.My boyfriend order the lobster but never specified the weight of it. The waitress decided by herself. Then when the bill came, we had to pay too much money for an average meal.The bill also included the peanuts that we never order and the hand towels that another waitress gave me when I asked for napkins. Unbelieveble..
5
I am a local and this is my 2nd visit. The pushcart dim sum is fantastic and I actually prefer this style to ordering, as u can see the exact dish and decide whether you want it.The food is great and inexpensive.I'm surprised that other reviewers commented about the bad service? They are mostly Chinese aunties who were quick and efficient in handing dishes to us. Maybe they don't smile too much and describe the dishes in detail, but that's because they can't speak much English and I don't fault them at all. :) Don't expect 5 star hotel service because that's not what this place is about. It's fantastic for its food, efficiency and atmosphere.
2
How to rate this place I wonder. The food we ended up ordering was good but the road to getting there was not without hassle. Due to non-smiling, no english speaking, non-personal and frankly non-caring about anything or anyone staff at this place you are on your own figuring out the menu. If you would know what to get it wouldn't be a problem and you just don't give a crap about the horrible, unhelpful service. Unfortunately, we were without help and ended up with a bit of a strange menu mix of dim sums. True, they were good but I feel it could have been so much better. Only go here with advice or knowing your stuff and you'll have an awesome lunch/dinner. Otherwise avoid it because you'll leave the place not feeling totally satisfied and there is no need for that in this part of town
4
Terrific classic yum cha food. It was full of flavour, generous servings of prawns, yummy slippery and crispy coatings on tasty fillings. Servings were attractive.It was inexpensive, quick and has a very pleasant ambience, apart from the somewhat glum waitrons.Sited in an old shop house, up a flight of lovely teak stairs, it is in the middle of the bustling and crazy night market. Certainly the place to visit in Chinatown. Loved the food
4
Fabulous authentic dim sum delivered by waitresses pushing choosing trolleys . Excellent value great choices friendly efficient staff. We were upstairs and it was busy at midday on Saturday. Chinese tea and beer, plenty of dim sum 5 eating 80 dollars. Hope we shall go agai
4
The food was good. Service so so only. However the atmosphere wasn't good as it was like a market, simply too noisy. It is always with long queue and if you really want to go, remember to make reservation one or two days in advance. And reservation is very strict, cannot be late. Suggest to let customers fill up the menu slip on what they want to eat rather than pushing the carts around because the restaruant itself is not spacious enough. The restaurant sign board is not easily seen along the road. If you are driving, the parking is not cheap, $1 per half an hour

The dim sum was pretty average - nowhere near the Crystal Jade standard. Restaurant has a quaint chinatown location, but the waitresses were pretty unfriendly and some even quite rude. I wouldn't go back there.

Nice Chinese restaurant.
They have good dim sum, chilli crab even. Best thing is they have delivery service.
4
This place lives upto its name - awesome dim sums and you will be spoilt for choice. the menu is very friendly, it has images of each of the dish.
Dessert recommendation - Egg Tarts.
4
Food is very good and good variety of choices for dim sum. Very busy during lunch though. Breakfast and tea time is better

Nice chinese restaurant with good food, lot of chinese people come during the week end with their family all the generation together, the old women serve you, kids like so much !

Recommended by a local and we were not disappointed. Very good, fresh dim sum - very speedy service, lots of locals which is always a good sign and delicious food so perfect for a tourist who wants good food at a reasonble priced without having to spend hours waiting around. Would definately go back

Located just of Temple St, this restaurant is always busy with locals and those tourists lucky enough to know about it. During peak times there can be a line up to get in but they turn over the tables quite quickly so usually the wait is not bad. They provide an excellent menu with pictures of each dish, so can order off the menu or wait for the trolley to come around and take what is there..Food is excellent quality, staff are efficient and service is fast.Will always visit when going to Singapore

I tried the weekday tea buffet which was good value because you can order as much as you want. Food was pretty good, there were plenty of steamed and fried dumplings and other dishes you can order as well. Prices have increased from last time and they did take out some dishes (eg. sweet and sour pork) that used to be there before. Service is poor - almost all the waiters there speak mostly chinese and they give you attitude as and when they feel like it. Ordering from them is hard and requesting simple things like water can be a challenge. The waiters/waitresses there never smile and are impatient when taking orders or answering questions. Food that we ordered did take quite sometime to come so be prepared to wait if you don't want to fill up quickly on the fried dumplings they repeatedly serve you on a cart that they go around with. The century egg porridge was a big disappointment because there was about 1/4 century egg inside the porridge. We liked the desserts - mango pudding, egg tarts and red bean pancake. It can be very crowded and noisy, especially on weekends

I always bring visitors to Yum Cha for the experience and of course the food. The service is usually average to poor, its incredibly noisy at lunchtime at the weekend and you usually have to queue for a table.However it is all worth it for the food. Excellent dim sum, great flavors and incredible value for money. Can't say its a relaxed experience but definitely a 'must' if you are visiting Singapore

I've been patronising here since its inception when our favorite Jumbo Restaurant left Serangoon Gardens Country Club. The ambience is grand wt high ceilings & spacious. Very good for inviting guests & family gatherings. Food is good but slightly on the pricey side. Dim Sums are good and lots of variety to choose from either order through waiters or pick from the push-carts. Seafood is presentable and nice but the crabs may not be always packed and meaty unlike No Signboard Restaurant which never fails to serve good quality meaty packed crabs. Service can be unpredictable & depends on your luck. Our first few visits were unfortunate to have this one female supervisor, Mag, who was blatantly rude, unprofessional & ill-treating us & other neighboring tables too. I feedbacked to Simon, the manager, but he coudln't do much to improve. At times, we had an excellent supervisor named John but sadly he has left after our 6th visit. Simon is stll there and he still behaves with an indifferent attitude, one ear in one ear out. Occasionally, the waiting time for our dishes was late and delayed despite several reminders. I reckon Simon needs to improve his attitude to serve diners with a heart and not just as a manager title. I find the elderly aunties who serve dishes are nicer, more pleasant, courteous and friendlier than the supervisors or Simon. With UOB cards there's discount.I normally hold celebrations like birthdays, Mothers Day, reunions, gatherings in this place due to its proximity to my house. Oyes, parking is ample and can be valet too. Sad to say, the standards have dropped through the years. Also because the management are not willing to listen to genuine feedbacks from their loyal & faithful supporters. Seems to play hard to reach giving the impression of aloofness & cold

It is a good restaurant, descent food, good service, and great location. I wouldn't say this is the best dim sum, it is worth a try and pretty famous in Singapore. It is crowded during meals peak hour so reservation is suggested.

Being from out of town the concierge recommended Yum Cha for Dim Sum. If you are looking for a quite, intimate meal, Yum Cha is not the place for you. Of course there was a line and once you got in you got a feel for the rhythm and the controlled chaos. I had so much fun picking and choosing what to eat and asking for recommendations from the staff. I was not disappointed and all the flavors were new a enjoyable
3
I used to be a big fan of Yum Cha. However, it has grown in popularity so much that (1) there is always a wait for a table, (2) the staff are overwelmed and getting a waitress' attention is a struggle, (3) because of the full tables, it is hard for the "dim sum" carts to move between tables, meaning that it is hard to get food, (4) it is very noisy, and (5) trying to pay one's bill takes a long time. Our trip there for lunch last Saturday was just not fun. I also noticed that food quality has gone down and prices have inched up. I recommend going to one of the many other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood -- after all, all Chinese food is about the same: lots of sauces and MSG
5
I ordered Yum Cha delivery today for my colleagues and wow I am so impressed! We ordered Set A and 3 other ala carte items for 12 adults. What impressed me, besides the delicious food, was their thoughtfulness and attention to little details! The delivery man carried all the food to the allocated place, which required him to climb up the stairs. Then, he took out a disposable table cloth and started laying all the food. I offered to help but he kindly declined, saying it is part of his job. What impressed me further was the fact that my delivery came with disposable cutlery that was catered for more then 20 adults and even had several garbage bags! Wow, I am really impressed! Each of us paid $11 for this delivery and we definitely agree that the portions could feed another 3 adults for sure! Thumbs UP for Yum Cha! You are a gem

Every time I'm in Singapore I go at least twice to this restaurant in the heart of Chinatown. Dim sum is fantastic (reasonable prices) and the lobster noodles are over the top (but expensive). My favorite is steam dim sum but I have to say that the deep fried mango and prawns rolls are great. I suggest to drink chinese tea with dim sum and here the chinese jasmine tea is excellent quality. At the weekends you don't have to order from the menu because you can choose directly from the trolley passing by the tables

Last weekend, I took some Australians friends to Yum Cha for breakfast. Out of the 15 reviews for this year, half have four and five stars. My friends enjoyed the food, the dim sums are fresh (especially those with prawns), and I findthe service greatly improved from my last visit. The moment I flipped over the cover of the tea pot (meaning that they should refill the pot) someone quickly took the pot away and came back with a fresh pot of tea. We left behind one small pau, but one of the elderly waitress saw this and insisted we should not waste and she went to put it in a small bag for us. I will visit again
5
dim sum is one of those things that can either be wonderful or tatseless , yum cha has a menu of plenty options and wonderous things to chose from me and my partner have fallen in love with dim sum ever since i came back from hong kong and introduced him to it , anything steamed IS GOOOOOOD!!! yum cha is always busy but always easy to get a seat never waiting more then 5 mins .its cheap cheerful and right in the middle of chintowns markets , a little hard to find at first but just ask a local and they will point u in the right direction ..enjoy it ! and tell me alllll about i
4
This is a feast not for the faint hearted. The pork buns are truly amazing! The sauce they use is so tasty. The service was lacking but lets be honest its all about the food! 3-5pm they do cheap Yumcha and we wish we had more time to go back again
2
So we are Yum Cha fanatics and were excited to be in a largely Chinese city with the opportunity to indulge ourselves. We were very disappointed. The restaurant was ok the service was not bad but the food was mush. Poor fillings, tasteless dumplings and weak sauces. If you have Yum Cha regularly in either London or Melbourne dont bother coming here. Trip Advisor is usually very good for recomendations but not his time
4
My husband and I have been to Yum Cha a couple of times now, once in 2010 and once just last month. It's a fairly decent restaurant, slightly hidden away if you don't know where it is - the restaurant is kinda sparse, hence my 'basic' title .. there are no fancy frills here! The staff are ok, I mean they do their job and serve you quickly, but it's a place for striking up conversation or having a joke with the staff .. it's just about serving (which is fine, though can sometimes come across a little unfriendly). The food however is amazing! We love the dim sum, congee, and there are these amazing prawn and mango rolls which are just incredible! In 2010 we also had some kind of deep fried prawns hung over the side of a half carved out pineapple - we couldn't get that this time but they do still serve it, and it's delicious! Even though the service/decor is pretty ordinary, the food is amazing, and it's a perfect spot to go for lunch or dinner after spending the day in Chinatown. We'll always go back
3
Nested upstairs in Chinatown, no problem withe the range and flavor of the food but there isn't much joy /personality from the staff and the ambience is light compared to other places in the area. Pricing suggests more work needed on these points.
5
Great place to get Dim Sum right in the heart of Chinatown!
5
This restaurant has very good dim sum, great menu, and good service, always busy.
3
The dimsum variation quite alot, and it taste great! The prawn is freshly made, and there are some new variation of dimsum that you cant find somewhere else. However, the service is not so good. Alot of customers yet so little waiter around. Anyway you can view some photos in my blog, cassijes.blogspot.com :

We were able to get a last minute seating on Chinese New Year. We only waited about 10 minutes. Pretty decent dim sum where there are ladies with carts and well as being able to order off the menu. All the basic choices available included hakaw, shumai, egg custard pies, lo mi kai, cha siew boa, etc. Not the best dim sum I've had (in LA:)) but definitely quality.
4
We took the High Tea Buffet Promotion - $21.80++ for adults and $16.80++ for children 3pm-6pm (Last order at 5.30pm).Even thou it's a weekday we got a shock when we enter as there's a huge crowd; we manage to get a table along the restaurant pathway (which is a good choice). :)We were presented with a menu (which is a A4 size red colour paper), a total of 67 items were listed. There's 5 categories: Steam Dim Sum, Fried Dim Sum ,Rice,Rice Roll & Congee, Side Dishes & Dessert.The waitress will be pushing a cart around with all the Steam/Fried Dim Sum & Side Dishes, just tell her what u want or u could simply point at the dishes (if u not sure what's the dish name, like us) and it will be put onto yr table. Or u could order from the menu, dish name is in English & Chinese.We were so overwhelm be the variety of Dim Sum available that we just keep pointing and ended up with a table cover full of food! The Dim Sum were pipping hot & fresh, personally I like the steam stuff better as I found the fried Dim Sum a tad too oily.I would advise to get yr hand on the baked mini egg tarts & coconut tarts half way though yr meal and not wait till last as they run out pretty fast, it's really delicious.A good way to end the meal with the lemongrass jelly with fruits, the slight tangy favor of lemongrass is refreshing after a full meal.It's a nice place to have a meal and play catch-up with friend or family member. Just don't seat too far away from the pathway, cos at times it's had to catch the attention of the waitress & the push cart may not be able to go near yr table
5
Was a little put off by some of the reviews but we found this restaurant fantastic. Couldnt fault the food or the service.We had the afternoon tea (buffet all you can eat). They came around with push-carts and the manager was very attentive. We asked for a particular dish that didnt seem to be on any of the carts and after about 5 mins a lady brought us a plate to the table... they had made the dish especially for us and you could tell how fresh all the dishes tasted.We did seem to be the only Westeners there, but doesnt that say its good, eat where the locals eat is our motto.Much smaller than Maxim's in Hong Kong but just as good we thought
4
I've visited Yum Cha several times with my family, and always had fine meals. This is something of an accomplishment, given the surly disposition of the management and the unhelpful wait-staff (many of whom don't speak English). The challenge is to secure the items one intends; photos of many varieties of dim sum in the menu are of considerable help.You're going to spend a good deal of money to satisfy a healthy appetite, but the quality of the flavors you'll experience may well dull the pain in your wallet! Stated simply: Yum Cha does dim sum right
5
I found there was a lot of improvement compared to the last time that we visited 2 years ago.Everything is good, our bill came to $60 and the both of us really enjoy it.The service is good, maybe because I can able to speak Mandarin to the ladies
3
I can only compare this to the yum cha back home in Melbourne.I found this place upstairs in a street off Temple St in middle of Chinatown. Poorly signposted and had to ask local shopkeeper for directions.Came for lunch on weekday and there was a photo description menu rather than wheeled trollies which made it easy to order but less interesting.The yum cha was standard rather than inspiring. Tasty+ Would like to try Yum Cha elsewhere in Singapore before rushing back
2
Had brunch here, restaurant was crowded, service was slow and rather apathetic. Dim sum was cold, overall standard of food has dropped. And do remember to check your final bill as they overcharged me by $15
4
Excellent dim sum and traditional Chinese food at affordable prices in the heart of Chinatown. The wine is expensive and only sold by the bottle so stick to tea. Delicious food can't wait to go back.
5
we liked their crabs , shrimps..everything!!! the staff were also helpful in keeping my son's birthday cake while we wearing still having dinner
5
This is a dim sum heaven in the heart of Chinatown, during weekdays you have to order from the menu but during weekend waiters pass by from table to table with trolleys packed with bamboo buckets full of dim sum delicacies. A must try in Singapore and don't forget to eat your dim sum drinking only water and chinese tea for a very far east experienc

Nestled in the heart of the Chinatown district, Yum Cha offers a delectable array of authentic Chinese cuisine. During a short vacation, a friend who lives in Singapore highly recommended this place. Me and my friend's family went here for some dim sum feast and we were not disappointed. The dim sums were great and we enjoyed every bite of what we ordered. I especially loved their siew mai, che cheong fun and xiao long fun. Restaurant ambiance was acceptable and the staff were accommodating
4
We had lunch here on our second day in Singapore and it was a great experience - very authentic dishes for Dim Sum. The service is perhaps not as good as the food, but this tends to be the case in most Dim Sum restaurants.Best to arrive earlier on Sundays, to avoid the long wait at the entrance
5
Visited there with my husband and daughter for lunch on Sunday afternoon. Although the restraunt was crowded and were so many people waiting, we were so lucky to get the seat soon because we were only three people, while the others were large parties. We seated at a table beside window with a pretty view of lanterns, but the window itself adds a oriental spice to the room. Of course the food were good: as were shown in the pictures, they look nice as well. We rushed to Pekin Duck, and had nine dim sum and oolong tea. What surprised us was that the total price was 56 Singapore dollars!!! Definitely visit there again

Dined here several times & had enjoyed most of the time except for this particular manageress, Madalene, who was rude to the core & deliberately pick a fight with customers.Without the ugly encounter with her, I would have rated this restauarant as "Excellent". Apparently, when we returned next round the management did nothing to her even after giving valuable feedbacks. Otherwise, i find the food 'great', waiting service by other staff 'good', ambience 'very spacious & high ceilings', price is on the high end. Would i go back, the ugly encounter is a phobia unless the management take actions on Madalene's rotten attitude

Well, despite the place being busy and often a bit noisy we always enjoy this place when we go to Sing. The Dim Sum are good ,at times very good. with a wide choice. If you arent getting what you want then try a bit harder and be nice to the staff, they a generally rushed off their feet. Ordering rather than waiting for trolleys ensures you get served The main i.e. non dim sum menu is fine and the food is goood. Bargain dealls for early morning and afternoon. The best DS place in Sing, or KL for that matter

We went here on our last day in Singapore. We were staying in Chinatown and wanted something from a restaurant so we could sit down. Service was absolutely shocking.They use a button system where you push a button when you are ready to order, want more water or want the bill. Good luck getting them at any other time. And my waitress was very cranky and spoke no english whatsoever. But.... our meal was good. Sizzling beef and sweet and sour pork, rice and chinese tea came to around $45 sgd, not cheap for chinatown but the food was tasty. Pity about everything else thoug

It was better.
3
They have nice char siew paus but overall, it was average.
3
expensive.
2
Food wasn't the greatest. We've had more authentic dim sum in LA.Service was ok. The hostess needs some attitude adjustment.
3
too much msg in the food, cause the group was really thirsty afterwards. otherwise the pushcarts added to the whole dim sum experience.
4
Great place for value-for-money dim sum high tea on weekdays.
2
nothing to rave about
5
Good!

went to yum cha restaurant in singapore for the first time in ages for yum cha and was sooo dissapointed. the trolleys didn't even make the efforft to come to our table. we had to keep asking for more food. they weren't THAT busy...surely they would want to try to make more money??

Dim Sum @ Yum ChaHad a desire for some nice Dim Sum. Followed a recommendation and headed into the heart of China Town. A little hard to find, hidden away in the back streets between Smith and Temple Street, above a perfume shop.Had the DimSum Buffet at SD16.80++ per person. If you arent sure what you like, or want to try lots of different things, its a great idea. The waitresses bring round and offer you a variety of plates by hand or in a trolley, and you say yes or no. Because you pay a fixed price, it means you can try some new things without worrying about wasting money.Tip: the menu has a few categories of things that you order from your server, the rest is pot luck what is brought round. However, we found that if there was something on the general menu we particularly wanted, our server was happy to order it for us anyway.Left feeling very stuffed, and having tried some interesting things. We appeared to be the only non locals there, but that wasnt a problem in any way.(http://www.yumcha.com.sg/Contact.html

Eh...it's still Hongkong specialty to yum cha la...we're so not like them. SIgh~

The best Dim Sum in Singapore

First Dim Sum after moving to Singapore. Fried rise was good.

It's really that bad... low price, no quality.

Improved a lot over the past few yrs.

Red Star is definitely better

overrated and pricy

Dim Sum was quite tasteless.
