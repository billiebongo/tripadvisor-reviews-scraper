Slow service, cold food. Not as good as expected. Pastries were cold. Waited to collect one item by one item.

it's basically continental breakfast...but yes, store is filled with old world charm...food is really just ok.

The boil and and toast is the one we went there for. The egg was awesome, its on point of a soft boil egg. Toast was delicious, kaya & butter. However its cold. No doubt is a famous oldie food shop however the price is kinda expensive. I cn get better toast with cheaper rate outside. I tried it because its always on Q. But i womt go back just for it. Service is fast but with attitude problem from old folks. Well.... u decide. & egg tart is more like custard tart. Disappointed

We came here with our local friend who recommended the kaya toast and soft boiled egg with kopi coffee. It was amazing!! You dip the bread that has a coconut spread on it into the soft boiled egg and it is the perfect combo of sweet and salty. The coffee is pretty strong but with the perfect amount of sugar and milk, it is delicious. We also tried the egg tartlet and thought it was pretty tasty. Highly recommend this local spot

The shop went through simple renovation last year, but menu remained unchanged. Prices of pastries and drinks have gone up, but noticed that the quality has declined. A pity that this has happened, but will visit for old timesâ€™ sake as the shop is a gem in Katong. Queue can be long at certain timing, so be prepared to share table with someone else.

It seems nowadays people are reading reviews then going to check out places based on someone else's say so. Sadly, all too often we can go with these expectations that are built up way too high. If we go without expectations we can often just enjoy the experience for what it is, without being too judgemental. Just like here, simple old style kaya toast with eggs and a cup of old style coffee. What are we to expect from somewhere selling the most basic dishes? This simple food can't and shouldn't be made to be anything more than it is. What this place does is to toast their bread in a way that gives it an old charred flavour. Their kaya spread is rich and tasty and their coffee, sure it may not be as good as some others, but hey don't forget how much for paying for it.Put simply - great value for money simple & tasty food

And found it! A tiny old schoolish Chinese bakery complete with the slightly moody aunties to go with it. Lovely egg tarts and other baked goods. Worth the trek from our hotel. The East Coast area also has a semi old world charm interspersed between the ever burgeoning modernity of singapore.

this little coffee shop situated in old colonial building. old people take care of the shop. so be aware: SLOOOOOW food! coffee was good, strong and perfumed. people seems to go there for eating half raw egg and bread with butter and a yellow jam. friendly atmosphere. even cakes seems good. i just like the coffee very much that i took two cups
5
I think I've just discovered a new venue for the old-school kaya butter toast. The bun is toasted to crispy perfection, sandwiching a thick slab of butter with home made kaya that is oh-so-sinfully delicious. I paired mine with two soft-boiled eggs drenched with dark sauce and pepper along with black coffee to complete the course. They also offer other pastries on the menu.The decor of the shop offers a touch of nostalgia that is rather appealing in my view. There are not too many tables so one must be prepared to wait in queue
2
Don't expect anything at all..it has long lost its authenticity and passion. The quality of bread and coffee served here can be easily found anywhere in Singapore. In fact the coffee shop at the corner serves better toasts and coffee (minus the hype). Attitude is extremely bad..if you are coming because someone raves about it, don't waste your time. This place is nothing more than hype
3
The coffee and kaya butter bun were far behind my expectation but indeed it is very cheap. It only cost $3.90 for what I ordered in the picture
3
Very traditional, even the service is old time take-it-or-leave-it. Like the coffee. Toasted buns are nice. They are known for their kaya, and I noticed many older people buying tubs of kaya from the owner.
5
Recommend the eggs, toast and black iced coffee. The pastries from the counter at the front are also yummy!
5
Honest good food which reminds me of childhood. There's always a queue so be patient. Order their half boiled eggs, coffee and Kayu toast!
Highly recommended!

CMCC as it is often abbreviated is located in Joo Chiat/Katong area and is one of the iconic hotspots in the area. Visiting CMCC is all about old world charm of what an old coffee shop looked like in the olden days. Its old style coffee tables and chairs and the mosaic floor. The Kaya toast and egg tart are pretty standard as compared to other old style coffee shops. Be prepared for crowds especially on weekends.

Located not too far from Katong 112 Shopping Mall, this place is small and old. Looks like they're selling old local breakfast. Sadly said, i expect to feel "local and authentic" but too bad, cannot feel it from their food. Place wise yes, it's really old. Drinks and kaya buns were good, but the egg tart and other cakes were below standard
4
The food itself which is the kaya bun, no doubt, it indeed is nice. A typical local breakfast: bun, half boil/ hard boil eggs and tea or coffee. Get to experience the atmosphere of the olden days kopitiam in Chin Mee Chin. Recommend to have breakfast here
4
Retro in its original form. From the wall & floor tiles to the marble top tables & wooden hairs to the wall clock & paintings. Come here early for the all time favorite cream puffs which sells out before lunch. The coffee & tea is super value for money prepare in traditional cloth bag manner, good till the last sip. The Kaya toast is another must try with boxes of home made kaya flying off the shelf on daily basis. Be prepared to share tables on weekend mornings. Simply love the nostalgia.
4
Famous for its kaya buns, Chin Mee Chin has good local coffee tea as well (the tea is so-so). It has custard puff pastries too, which are delicious. The kaya buns (on buns, rather than white toast bread) are heavenly. You can also pick up their kaya pase for $6 a pop

I'm not someone who grew up in the eastern part of the island, so some of my friends think I climbed down the wrong tree in the past. Therefore it should be no surprise that I hadn't even heard of this confectionery till about a couple of weeks ago. I popped in to get some kaya (coconut jam made from coconut milk, eggs and sugar) because it was supposedly very well known and generally sold out quickly. After spreading it on some bread, I have to admit that the kaya was rich and tasty, so that's my grade for this review. I didn't stop to eat at the shop, so can't really comment on the service and such. But looking at the place, my first impressions weren't too good and I probably bother coming back

Was recommended by a local friend. Had Kaya sandwich. Warm bread, warm kaya and melting butter. Lovely.
5
this is one of the specialities of SIngapore and it was so lucky that i had tasted it once. Very good!
5
Great place to visit w/ authentic unmanufactured retro food & feel. Clean but prepare to Q if going mornings. Best time to visit lunch time or after lunch to beat the Q. Must haves Kaya Butter Bun & coffee. And the simple cup cakes. Service can be laid back but the feel & food make the place genuine.
4
This place has had a long history. The coffee is good. The cream puff is a must try. If your lucky, try the egg tarts, curry puffs too. That is if they are not sold out yet. A pity that the current generation managing the place can't cope and usually the stuffs get sold out in the morning right out from the oven

This is a place strictly for having a look at how coffeeshops look like during Singapore's early years. Then again, there are many such places in Singapore too. The food there is nothing to scream about. In fact, none of the pastries that I bought tasted exceptional. The icing on one of the pastry is similar to the shell of an egg - hard. Service is none existent as the staff there are just cold and not interested to talk. lastly, it is not exactly cheap
5
I rate this place highly solely based on the taste of the kaya toast and the Confectionary, which is very old school, but good that way. FOODThe kaya is homemade everyday. The old school kaya is not as smooth as the modern day ones, and there is a stronger taste of eggs in it. But it is not very sweet, or as ridiculously sweet as some kaya can taste and it complements the buns and butter very well. The Confectionary you get to buy depends on how early you get there. If you go to the coffee shop early, you are likely to enjoy the luncheon meat buns, cream horn, donuts. By noon, there will only be custard tart, whole cakes and chocolate cupcakes left. Coffee is very good and robust - but this depends on who is making it. The ice coffee is bad though, as they don't put a lot of condensed milk in it, so it ends up tasting very bitter. PRICEThis maybe an old coffeeshop, but the price is nowhere near what it was in the past.Bun- $1.802 Eggs- $1.50Kopi O-$1Tart/cupcakes-$1Donut- $0.80Big whole cake- $16Service can be very slow and inefficient. The old lady is nice but the middle age short hair woman can be very ferocious. They won't hesitate to lash out at customers, but despite that, people still flock to the shop for breakfast on most days. This place is not appropriate for long hearty conversations as you will be expected to leave the moment you finish your meal when there is a queue (and there is almost always a queue) I like going to this coffeeshop as I sometimes get to meet really interesting people when I share a table with them, like an elderly Singaporean couple who migrated to Australia but was back for a holiday and a Cambodian man who went to America to escape the pol pot regime in the 1970s

My first time trying this place. Very nostalgic feel the moment you enter the shop. Please be prepared to queue on weekend mornings since the place is quite small with limited tables. Many young couples patronize here for breakfast. The egg tart was damn damn delicious. Kaya toast was great and Kaya is not too sweet. Soft boiled eggs are done just nice unlike those from Toastbox or Ah Kun shops. But please note eggs are single order. Ventilation not that good so it's not a place to catch up with friends. Don't expect much service as most of the servers average age is at least 65. Total bill was less than $15 for family of 6

It was a bit hard to find this place. There are not that many seats in this place so you may need to wait a bit for a table. We ordered kaya bun (not toast), coffee and eggs. Service was rather slow - it's run by a family I think. I think the kaya bun is quite traditional but we prefer kaya toast. We also tried their egg tart which was our highlight. Come here if you want to check out the old style breakfast otherwise it may not be worth the trip
5
I was here for breakfast and it is clearly a popular choice with the locals. Kaya toast is a must-have. A long line for a table and you might even have to share a table, but it's well worth it. This place takes you back into the 70s
5
The atmosphere is very old style, the food is still made the old way.The kaya they make is absolutely the best in Singapore. The place is so popular that you might need to queue.A definite stop for those who want to have a genuine although not "healthy" since kaya is made by eggs, coconut milk and sugar - with addition of pandan to give its characteristic color and fragrance
2
You simply pay for the atmosphere. Nothing special about the food or anything there. Did not quite like the coffee or anything. Was normal.
Service was quick and polite.
1
Yes, there is a bit of an old colonial atmosphere in the area.Yes, it stayed authentic and probably didnt change for years.But it doesn't mean its great at all.If you like to wait.If you like when its hotter inside than outside.If you like when the food takes 30mn to come while you are sweating under the fan.If you like to know for yourself why kaya is better with toasts, not buns.Then, yes go there.Otherwise, please someone take over this place and make something great

This is a bakery that’s located in a corner shophouse, next to Holy Family Church.The bakery has been here for years and the second generation of the original owner is now running the show. Their specialities are their home-made kaya, that you can eat on-premise or takeaway. I ordered two toasts with kaya and butter. The toast are placed over a charcoal fire, which gives the toast a nice browning and lines where the bread rests. The toast also has a smoky aroma. The kaya was thick and lumpy and spread onto the toast with a thick slice of butter. Spread the butter out and I ate it. Absolutely wow… Delicious!We also ordered tea: They have the usual tea with condensed milk and tea with evaporated milk. Every table has a glass of sugar and a spoon, where diners can scoop the amount of sugar that they prefer into their tea for their prefered level of sweetness. The tea is served in small porcelain cups and saucer, so it invokes the old time feel of Katong. The tea is good. Takeaway for the kaya comes in containers: Small for $3 and large for $5.Highly recommended to come by after lunch or the afternoon for a cuppa in a yester-year nostalgic ambiance

the kaya bun was lovely, the service laughable (got it wrong, then forgot it, then finally brought it), the atmosphere like something out of the 60's....tiled floors and walls, no air con, hard chairs and marble tables, crowded. but i loved the kaya was delicious and the atmosphere a welcome change from the onslaught of gentrification in the area
1
Do not ever step foot into this place. Staff are very rude & obnoxious.Obviously if there is a queue the person infront is to get the next available seat. Staff & the lady boss herself ignores customers & can't be bothered with running a business. Disgusted with such attitude & bad behavior.

Step into CMC and you feel like you've been transported to decades ago. Makes me feel like lazing around reading papers leisurely over a cup of kopi. Never been able to do that though as the incoming crowd just puts pressure on me. I enjoy the kaya but the bun came cold which was really disappointing. It's $1 for a small bun.Drinks are so-so, starting from $1.10 for a small cup of kopi or teh.Take your pick from the tarts and cakes in the shelves. Start from about $1 each. I like the experience of picking but taste is just normal. Run out fast tho, so if you go say in the late morn, selection is limited.Auntie got our drinks order wrong and didnt tell us the luncheon meat bun we ordered had run out. We discovered. later when it didn't arrive.Would say food is normal, at rather expensive prices. Best part is the nostalgic traditional setting.
2
I was a regular customer here until their service dropped maybe due to the busy period. Although their kaya buns are nice but they don't even know how to time their soft boiled eggs that turned out either too cooked or too uncooked. Gave up and decided not to waste anymore time here with the poor service

Stepping into the historic kopi tiam, you see people from all ages and all sorts of attire, drinking kopi, playing iPhone while waiting for the kaya toast to be served.I must have forgotten about the crowd as I came here on one of the busiest day-National Day.Don't be alarm if the auntie ignores you. Just be on an eagle-eye to catch the next empty table. We managed to squeeze into a corner table, stuffy but at least that saves up the extra charges for air-con. "自己拿啊、自己拿啊＂,chirped the Hainanese old auntie, who left after clearing the bowls from earlier visitors. "Wah! So good ar! " What if anyone take extra and not pay?" Well, this boils down to trust and honesty, I guessed. Grab a plate and pick your own pastries. No need to wait for the aunties to come......just start feeding yourself because the drinks, eggs and toasts take time to cook.Each pastry on display sits on a paper lining, which the auntie did not even bother to count after everything. We had 6 pieces at first; 4 egg tarts, 1 plain and 1 almond cupcake. And ooh...these egg tarts are SUPER delicious. I have been deceived Nth times by numerous tasty-looking egg tarts which ended up with pliable tarts. But not this time. The dark brown shell is thicker-than-usual, but crumbly and fragrant.Call them cupcakes but do not compare them with those popular cupcakes on the street nowadays. Not moist, greasy nor very sweet. You might find it dry but these are how they should be.Being just fresh out of the oven, I popped one carelessly into my mouth, forgetting that they are meant to be shared. Every now and then, a fresh tray of baked items out from the kitchen draws me to see what's out there. Though they were not the golden cream horns and custard puff, I took another 2 cupcakes with chocolate icing.The much awaited open faced toast buns ($1 each) were spread with green kaya. I did mention previously that my family usually prefer brown to green, but this is an exception. The kaya spread was aromatic and sweet, but just nice. Nonetheless, I would prefer thin-sliced kaya toasts. There was no need for the butter knife to spread the butter evenly. Just slam the other side down and chow through the lukewarm bun like a burger. Kopi? Milo? Or Teh? We had all of them. Though their beans are roasted traditionally in their kitchen, the coffee was diluted. The milo was not spared too. You won't have time to laze around and chill out with your friends compared to many hipster cafes (be prepared to receive glares by people who are queuing.... some people were hogging tables while playing iphones after their meal) I enjoy it this no frills kopitiam. Chop chop. Eat. Drink and Go.For full review and pictures pls feel free to visit my blo

Unlike other coffee joints, this cafe serves buns that are toasted with yummy self-made kaya with butter (4 stars for buns). Each should cost about S$1 each. However, the beverage served there was only so-so (3 stars for drinks). Each drink should also cost about S$1 each

This is like a throwback to the old days, when Katong still had many other similar old style confectioneries like Red House etc. The place is always crowded and people tend to take their time to have a leisurely breakfast, so it might be better to just pack the stuff to eat elsewhere. Highly recommend the cream puffs and the coronets (these sell out very fast), taken with a cup of kopi C or Ovaltine
