good italian food. It was my first time there. good food, good service, I will come back one day for sure.
5
The services are good, all the waiter/waitress serves with a smile. The food is slightly above average but the atmosphere compensate for everything.
4
Very nice meal, interesting takes on Italian, nice atmosphere, efficient service, all round recommended.
5
We had their white truffles special, black cod and ribeye.
Food was stupedous and service was warm. Wati, the asst manager offered good suggestions. We really enjoyed our maiden meal there and will definitely be back.
5
beautiful place with fantastic and warm service. the food was nice though nothing super mindblowing, just good italian done well.

We had a nice evening at Alba 1836 and were pleasantly surprised by the high service level and truly kind personnel. Not that they could all tell a whole lot about the food or wine, but at least they tried. The food was good, but not great and you would expect great for these kind of prices. So therefore the "average" rating
4
good customer service - service personnel wati is helpful.dining service - is good. all waiters and waitresses encountered are friendly and helpful. Nice bosses too who make effort to reach out to each table to build rapport, gather feedback from customers.food wise - i would say ...ok. wish to see improvement. soup served not hot...lukewarm is not what i like on a cold rainy night esp. ambience - good. clean and pretty good place for couple or for any biz meeting dinner. most important clean washroom haha!Wish - food improvement..frankly wish there is something real good and special that will make me want to go back. Selection is pretty soso. The cold cut platter not as outstanding to my expectation. For the pricing they charging, frankly i can get nicer italian at greenwood area or even at Mozza at mbs. However sing praise to the service, It is good so does the atmospher
4
Alba serves decent Italian food and surprisingly many wines by the glass. Knowledgable about the wines and giving tasters when in doubt.Friendly chefs are smiling through the windows from the kitchen, and service staff are attentive and friendly.I just wish there was non-smoking seating ourside as well..
5
I wanted to take two friends out for dinner. A sort of thank you. We had no place in mind when we arrived at this part of town and found this gem. Restaurant feels spacious and relaxing. The wine list is superb and the owner was on hand to chat through it. He was very friendly and helpful. We had the 5 course tasting menu which was really great. Each course fabulous. Would definitely recommend this place. And I will definitely be back.

We held a farewell party for a dear colleague at Alba at the recommendation of one in our party. Had the outdoor seating as we were a big party of 12. There was a big screen on the wall showing photos of Italy. There was only one other small table for 2 next to us. Thankfully the weather was quite cool that night. Wait staff were attentive and we were served by the owner as well. Mains took a little long to be served. Good wine list and enough food options. Found the octopus appetiser too chewy though unlike the ones I have had in Spain. Had the lobster pasta dish, found the pasta too soft. Presentation was good. We ordered a few dishes to share as it was hard to choose. Nothing unpalatable but not much Wow! Maybe next time will try their set menu which has to be preordered 2-3 days before. Easy parking at Craig road multi-storey parking. Restaurant just a stone's throw if you exit at the 2nd floor of the carpark Duxton hill exit
5
This is a great place at the top of Duxton Hill. The lunch menu is reasonably priced and the wine is delightful. The owners are very engaging and give good advice on the wine and food combinations! Well worth a visit!
5
Just a great experience every time we go. The owners are fantastic and front of house staff friendly and knowledgable. Our go-to place in Singapore when we want to know we're going to have a great evening.
5
Love the ambience and decor of Alba. Very sleek and modern.
The staff are very attentive and knowledgeable.
Food was excellent too.
Couldn't ask for anything better.
5
We had their 4-course dinner today, as a family of 7. The food was really good, and Matteo was so friendly. Service was excellent. Will be back again!
5
We had a business lunch with 10 pax in the separate room.
The staff was very attentive and correct. The 3-course lunch was amazing quality for excellent price 32 sgd ++.
We'll be back!
4
For a Friday night, the restaurant was pretty empty. Decor was nice as we walked in and service was good. However the food was pretty average which is probably why the restaurant was so empty - lots of other great Italian restaurants in the Tanjong Pagar neighbourhood with better food.
4
Was there on a Saturday evening. Even though the inside was full, and we were sitting outside, the staff were super attentive, beyond most other places here.They have many wines by the glass to choose from, and Schott glasses to enhance the flavours.We liked the outside garden, just wish that part of it could remain smoke free
5
We dined at Alba 1836, on a very special occasion. The host & owner Matteo was very cordial, and so was the staff! Some great choices of Antipasti, and main courses. Ordered the Taglioni with lobster, must try this one! Highly recommend to go for the desserts as well.
4
Classy and trendy Italian restaurant, excellent genuine Italian dishes. Maybe the tuna carpaccio was a bit too thick , two thinner slices could have better than oneExcellent red snapper perfectly cooked , good service but the waiters tend to push very expensive Italian wines , superb wine list but Singapore prices!!!!
3
We had a birthday dinner at the Alba. Alba is a beautiful property, great looking menu with generous wine selection. Staff is friendly and owner of the place greeted us and helped with the wine selection. Food just wasn't very good and there were quite many mishaps with wines and orders. Dishes were generous is size but flavors weren't that great. My main course was bass with chickpea pure, fish and whole dish was quite dry and lacking sauce. Overall dishes were ok but lack of ambition with finishing the portions and flavors was evident
5
we had an afternoon drink and business dinner. great atmosphere , exceptional wine list, very good service , great food
4
Very good value for money and nice environment for business or social lunches. Mixed fruits for dessert wasn't great but overall quite good.
5
We enjoyed all food and wine very much.
This is very very nice restaurant.
We can enjoy a lot of wine by glass hear which is very nice and all food is unbelievably wonderful.
5
What a great lunch menu. Had the burrata, squid ink risotto and tiramisu. $27 nett. Cant wait to go back and also try the dinner tasting menu!
5
Our party of three selected from three different items on the menu, pasta, Oso Buco, and steak. All three were done to perfection, and the extra bonus was that white truffles are in season and we enjoyed a white truffle extravaganza.
5
Excellent location, very peaceful and cosy: like having dinner in your own garden. I loved it. At last a very good wine list by the glass, a rarity in Singapore. Very good wine list.Tasty starters and desserts, with excellent service. I did not try the main courses: I definitely will the next time. The warm welcome by the owner was really appreciated
4
Second time here, food was fabulous just as it was the last time. Servers are attentive though could be a little more. We had to pour our own wine a couple of times (not that we couldn't of course) but with the servers just in the vicinity but backs to table.. thank you to the owner for the limoncello on the house!We will definitely be back
2
Went with important clients for their truffle celebration. Was not overly impressed. Poorly trained service staff . not value for money truffles which taste somewhat mixed. All the food was too salty and I like my food a bit more salty than most. Ordered rib eye steak , tiramisu , pasta . and coffee. Sorry not going back again
5
I've been here twice now - once for a biz dinner and again with my wife and a friend. Duxton Hill is a very pretty street with some older type buildings in the Shop House style.We were met by the owner and he made us feel really special. There was absolutely no drama when my wife asked to rearrange the menu because of very serious neurological issue she has. Often we are made to feel unwelcome but Alba were very sensitive.We love our wine but are not that well informed. The owner directed us to a really great red. My wife had steak, as did our friend - I had truffle pasta. The truffle is grated on the food at the table - it was delicious.I strongly recommend this place
5
We had never been to this area of Singapore and its no traffic location was great. So glad we chose to eat at the restaurant. The owner is an a lovely Italian man, very friendly, happy to advise and answer questions without being too intrusive. The food was delicate, delicious and well presented. The wine list was fantastic.we love the piedmont area of Italy so everything was right up our street. The d√É¬©cor and ambience was refined and intimate. Next time I think we will go for the outdoor decking seats which look out onto a small garden.We will return!
5
Great restaurant, wonderful atmosphere, fabulous food, wine and service. Would definitely recommend for couples/friends, a lovely way to spend the evening
5
Great restaurant. Food was good, service was a little slow and a bit inexperienced. Wine list was big and excellent üç∑üç∑Well worth a visit. Will definitely go back.
5
As an Italian, I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to eat excellent food, with an attentive service in a beautiful surroundings. Definitely not to be missed and my new favourite Italian in singapore!
4
Good reasonably priced food with impeccable service especially from Matteo, the boss himself. Huge collection of Italian wines.
5
Been to this restaurant many times and each time they do maintain the same excellent standard of the food. Had celebrated my son's birthday and the restaurant had a surprise complimentary dessert for him! Well done Alba and thank you!
4
Booked my table through Chope requesting for a table with a nice view because it's my friend's birthday. Got seated under the aircondition in the crappy corner of the restaurant instead. However, the food was great, and the waiters sang my friend a birthday song when her cake arrived. Thank you for the nice surprise.
5
Great space well decorated roomy.Fantastic wine list honoring the great wines from Italy at honest prices. Super octopus appetizer, rustic in best way tasty ragu tagliatelle, heavenly seared foie gras, sublime carpaccio. Everything homemade very clever chef as good or better than any top place in Italy. Go blindfolded, you will be more than satisfied you will be delighted

Alba 1836, is a new Italian restaurant to the Singapore circuit, located at the end of Duxton hill in a modernized spaciousness Shop house, which manages to retain the charm of the original building while providing a modern-day dining setting. The food and wine here is amazing. Better than most Italian restaurants in Italy. The food prices aren't unreasonable. The Oven roasted crispy suckling pig, and the Roasted lamb loin in a Sardinian Pecorino cheese crust were both really tasty. Very well presented and nice portions too. Seasoned and cooked to perfection.Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back
5
I visited the restaurant last Friday with my friend.The food was amazing and unique!All the staffs/manager were really kind and professional :) Thanks for the good service!I used to go there for drinking but I highly recommend the food too! I will visit again ;)
5
Have to agree with the other reviews - this is a great place. The service was friendly and efficient the entire evening. And the food was wonderful. The menu had many delicious options it was hard to decide but we ended up sharing two starters and then each had a main course.
4
Great ambiance in a quiet location. Service was lovely and set lunch was very good value for the quality.
5
The food was good, impressive wine list and what stands out most are the ambience and service. Our waiter Isk (not sure if I got the spelling right) was very professional. Likewise, the greeters as well. Would definitely go back again.
5
Went to ALBa with my husband for dinner on my birthday. It was our first time there. We had a great time! food and service were the best! Would go there again!!!
5
What a treat great location beautiful restaurant and the food I ordered was first class. The simple olive oil and balsamic delicious, the minestrone soup delightful and the Italian sausage pasta superb. A real treat all round in Singapore.
5
This is one of my favourite Italian restaurants. The set lunch is excellent value, costing $28 ++ or $35++ and the food is refined and tasty. Service is excellent too.
5
We were walking around late at night on a Tuesday and strolled in here at 1055 pm and greeted with a big smile despite closing time at 11pm. We enjoyed a lovely bottle of wine and chit chat in the garden in front of this lovely restaurant. For sure we'll be back soon. Thank you Mateo and staff for the smiles and hospitality
4
Came here for lunch with some friends this week and opted for the 3 course set at $32++. Food was really decent, just that the portions were a little small. Fortunately some very good bread is also provided so I didn't end up hungry. Service was friendly and efficient.
4
This is a good restaurant and like a few in Singapore does a great value fixed price lunch.For 32S$ you get a superb tuna tartare or a wonderful mushroom soup with truffle oil and a poached egg.Mains are excellent but the ragu is well worth it .....but the fish is good too.You can always go a la carte too.The wine list is superb - great variety of Italian wines and at a good price.Service is good and the owner is often around to give wise advice on wines.A very good place to have a long lunch........
5
I had a business lunch for the first time at Alba 1836, which was an excellent choice. In the evening, Alba has this romantic flair with its beautiful interior design, cosy lighting and Italian mellow music. I was therefore surprised to see that Alba is just as good for a business lunch. It's quiet for good conversations, without being embarrassingly quiet. Lighting is nice and bright at the windows and in the court yard. Food was excellent and impressed me (I had a seared tuna salad and saffron tagliatelle). The tuna almost melted on my tongue - excellent value for money!If you are taking people from outside of Singapore, the location on Duxton Hill with its nice shophouses is worth to stroll past. From evening visits, I can add that the Italian wines are excellent and good value for money. A good place to go when you want an alternative to the Kiwi Sauvignon Blancs and the Aussie Chardonnays here in Singapore! As a little detail, the olive oil served with the bread was of a quality that I have not had since I was in Europe last year. The al fresco setting - outdoor dining - is nice and quiet
4
This was our second visit to Alba and I realised why I like it so much. It is a modern looking restaurant with a lovely quietness to it. The sort of place you go to if you have people you actually want to converse with and hear them with ease! Don't get me wrong, the restaurant was quite full with other patrons, it is just the spacing of the tables etc that allow for this. The service is efficient and the food was beautifully presented as well as tasting wonderful. I started with a Wagyu beef carpaccio with some rocket salad, parmesan and truffle. Light but tasty. I then followed it with Veal Osso Bucco with polenta and again some truffles shaved on top. Very flavoursome and serving size was quite large. My husband had mushroom veloute with a soft boiled egg which he said was very flavoursome. He then had Seabass with asparagus which again was cooked to perfection. We didn't have room for dessert but were served some chocolates just to sweeten the palate!We had a bottle of Italian wine that was recommended to us and that was also a great suggestion as we thoroughly enjoyed it
4
Great value lunch set and good service. Location was quiet and peaceful. Ideal for catch up with friends or business lunches.
4
The chef has the talent to transform Italian classics into modern tasteful dishes. The wine list contains a wide variety of interesting Italian wines . The good thing is that even the cheaper wines are more than tasty . A place to return to !
5
Good food choice, originally presented, tasteful and pleasant staff, decor a little stiff but overall welcoming atmosphere
5
Every aspect of our visit to Alba was above and beyond expectation.
The variety of wines is outstanding and the food was sensational.
Service and atmosphere were delightful, a definite must for all visitors to Singapore and specifically Duxton Hill.
5
We just had a splendid evening at Alba. Overall fantastic which is rare in Singapore. This place really beats the standard.+ Service is very professional and good+ Tabbles are perfectly set with nice white linnen amidst a tasty decor.+ Staff respects the full etiquette and service standards of an upscale restaurant.But most important food & wines was simply top. And the restaurant bill was less than I anticipated. I would even say a very good price-quality ratio. Especially the wines are very friendly priced. Good quality, served at the right temperature in beautiful glasses and always filled before the next course (as it should be).We had the Burrata (very good), Octopus salad (very nice), fillet de boeuf Rossini (nice big slice of foie gras, good brioche), Lamb carr√É¬© (slightly too rare for lamb but fully to our taste. And as desert (Mille feuille of dark chocolate). With the desert we did not discover the dark chocolate but is was very tasty.Overall I am very impressed. I will come back and highly recommend Alba for a nice perfect quality dinner in a tasteful setting.You will not regret, recommended!
5
This is my favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore so far, the food is very tasty. The atmosphere is very pleasant and I had a great pecorino cheese with figs! The wine was quite nice too. My husband and I sat outside and as it gets darker, it gets cosy and quite romantic. The service is pleasant and the owner visited our table and we spoke a bit about where the food (ie pecorino cheese) came from. I would definitely visit again
5
Dear All, I brought my business associate there for dinning. The food of the quality was fantastic which I had never tried in any Italian restaurant in Singapore though I am a Singaporean. The wine was of course excellent. Will definitely recommend to friends and business associates. Never miss to frequent the place if you are in Singapore. Best Regards,Corrine
5
Can't go wrong. What a treat to have found this place.Difficult to find but well worth the effort. Google map and the taxi could not locate the place but with a little effort you can find it. You will NOT be dissapointed!The chef and the owner both visited our table and even though we were tourists gave us five star attention. The food was absolutely amazing. Good wine selection also. The service was immaculate. I can't say enough how great this place is
3
The restaurant has a nice modern feel with elegant touches, perfect for a romantic evening. The service was good and the owners were very welcoming and charming. We had a variety of dishes and the steaks stood out well, cooked just right, tender, juicy and flavorful. (USDA Prime Ribeye was a fairly big portion) Professsional and attentive service with good selection of wine. Park at the multi storey car park just right beside the restaurant and there is access from the 2nd storey if you drive.
5
Perhaps the best food experience I have ever had. Went for lunch with a client. The greeting by the waitor, the maitre'D, the service, their knowledge, wine recommendations = absolutely flawless from start to finish. The head chef himself came out and talked to us and we asked if he could put together a 3 course menu for us. He did so on the spot. An excellent salmon for starters followed by a home made velvet-like ravioli filled with ox-tail. It was absolutely exquisite from start to finish. Honestly Alba 1836 should at least have one Michelin star if not more! I expected the worst when the bill came, but it was completely affordable and I would have been happy to pay a lot more for the service and food we were provided. Hence we went heavy on the tip which was well deserved.I have never once given full score on every criteria to a restaurant, but Alba deserves it! This is a hidden diamond amongst the wealth of Singapore restaurants. Please go! You will not be disappointed
5
The place looks really nice, a mix of modern and classical.
Food is genuine Italian (the owners come from Italy and the chef is from Sardinia) with a modern touch.
Incredible selection of wines, the ones from Italy are fantastic.
5
This restaurant at the cul de sac end of Duxton Hill is simply sensational. The owners and the staff make your dining experience very personal and inviting from the moment you walk in the door and while the menu is totally enticing, so too is the interior design. Natural stone feature walls blend with earthy timber and clean contemporary furniture lines. Starting our meal with a complimentary glass of bubbles and the Chef's Amuse Bouche we went on to enjoy a gorgeous minestrone soup and a Wagyu beef carpaccio. This was followed by the Angus Beef fillet and grilled Mediterranean Sea Bass - both cooked to perfection. We finished our meal with a cheeseboard and while the cheeses were delicious and beautifully presented we had to ask for some bread to accompany them as no crackers are served. This is certainly a hidden gem that doesn't disappoint
5
My dear friends booked a table at Alba last week for dinner to celebrate Diwali, this was my first time dining there and i must say is was a great experience.We are all big fans of Italian food and have tried many places in Singapore but this is definitely a place not to be missed.The Sicilian red prawns were amazing very fresh and succulent, and so was the ravioli agnolotti filled with burrito cheese and black truffle. we had a great wine pairing from the sommelier at a surprisingly reasonable price.The warm welcome from the manageress and the friendly and attentive service made our experience very enjoyable.We will definitely be back for more
5
This restaurant is hidden in the back of Duxton hill.But something not to over look. I had a great dinner in a very nice atmosphere, with good service. And for all you wine lovers out there, they have a very large wine cellar. With a great selection at some of the most friendliest prices I have seen in Singapore
4
I was speechless when I walked towards the end of Duxton and found this almost hidden standalone gem almost resembling a villa in Toscana. The exterior faces a small patch of greenery and there are tables outside well ventilated by large fans. However pretty the exterior maybe, I am not a fan of drinking Piedmonte wines at room temperature so decided to take an indoor seating. As we walked in the restaurant, I was immediately impressed that the wine cellar was a part of the walk in corridor. I spent 20 mins looking carefully over the wine menu and found the list not only expansive but well priced. If you don't know your wines, try going for the house bottle Barolo Liste 2008 for SGD 104 or even the cheap Baron Riscasoli for 70 SGD. The Barolo Liste is elegant and well balanced. Other wines that I thought was value for money was the Tignanello 2011 for 165 SGD which drank pretty well.The service was always good and attentive.The disappointment was the food. I'm not saying it wasn't good....It just wasn't "wow". The burrata with heirloom tomatoes was beautiful and colourfully presented. The taste and portion was decent. Next, the raw red sicilian prawns marinated in olive oil was boring...the octopus salad was a bit bland. I didn't enjoy the thinly sliced octopus on my palette. I would've kept it chunky with cutting cubes of octopus and dressed it with high quality olive oil and lime, pepper and not added any greens or lettuce. That way you can taste the octopus on its own. Next I purposely ordered a simple pasta vongole to test how well they do simple dishes and it came out fairly dry with the texture of the pasta not even al dente. The taste though was ok. The biggest let down was the grilled USA beef prime grade angus rib eye at 60 SGD. The steak was dry served with a thick sauce. For 25 SGD, I could've bought a US Rib eye from Swiss bakery and cooked it myself to perfection.In short, I love the decor, the service is great and the wine list is impressive. But the food disappoints.....If I came back here, I would probably do what I do at Oso. Call the chef to the table and ask him what he can do for us and hopefully then they'll realise, we're not just average diners that get impressed with average food
5
We love this place, tucked at the end of Duxton Hill, the restaurant is wonderful to look at inside and out and the staff attentive from start to finish without being over the top. Menu is wonderful a collective difference for everyone's palate and the wine list is very extensive and the somiler knows his stuff. We take everyone here that comes to visit us in Singapore and everyone loves it - we took my Mum for her 70th and they must of over heard us taking and came out with a beautiful dessert and best wishes. Can't fault it love it , on every FB forum that asks for great place to eat I recommend Alba - thank you guys

It is shocking how some restaurants think they can get away with food court like shoddy service yet expect diners to pay $100/person. Alba 1836 is one of these.1- We arrived and they claimed not to have our reservation, asking us if we were in the right restaurant. Even after showing the confirmation email they still couldn't find our reservation.2- They told us to sit in a courtyard by the entrance and we demanded to sit in the main dining room, which they said was fully booked. 1/3 of the tables there remained empty all night.3- They poured olive oil but didn't bring us bread. Ever.4- They took our wine order but didn't bring the wine. We asked 3 times. Finally AFTER we had eaten our starters, I went into the wine cave to see the manager. He came out a few minutes later to ask what wine we wanted. They finally brought a different bottle, but we had to pour it ourselves5- They brought our wives their mains before we received our starters. Then when we were waiting for OUR mains, they brought menus for our wives to order dessert.6- We asked for ice three times, didn't get any.7- Finally the waiters pretty much disappeared, leaving us alone for the rest of the meal. We had to do everything ourselves.Shockingly bad
2
The food was disappointing - various canap√É¬©s of which they liked these fried balls with stuff inside - Heavy and not very good. It was white truffle season and they had the tagliatelle with truffle. The tagliatelle was completely over-cooked and ruined the whole dish. Desert was not too bad So many Italian restaurants in Singapore - maybe even cheaper than what we made. Never coming back Service was so friendly but not nice. They were always so cheerful but I sensed that they were impatient with us so it wasn't a nice feeling. We had two birthday celebrations but we forgot one so I arranged one last minute with them. So they highlighted to the birthday person that I had forgotten - talk about completely ruining the occasion!!

A nice setting on Duxton Hill (a leafy old street with beautiful old shophouses converted into a good group of restaurants, and bars). Alba 1836 has an open terrace outside next to a large tree and a modern interior. Tables are well spread out so you can dine without thinking that your every word is being heard by another table. We went on the recommendation of a friend who has been coming here since it opened and is a very satisfied regular customer - so expectations were good.The menu is well put together with numerous delicious sounding Italian dishes - no too pimped up and not too simple either, they've struck a good balance.We ate as a Group of 4 friends so had the chance to sample quite a few dishes.Starters: Tuna carpaccio was superbly presented, delicious. Foie gras was also delicious - simply done but well cooked. One of us had the prosciutto and mozzarella which was disappointing compared to the other dishes in both presentation and taste.Pasta: web chose four different ones. all delicious, and good sized portions tooMains: steaks. The black Angus with foie gras was perfectly cooked, delicious and similar level of fine dining as the rest of the food. Classically Italian with little or no vegetables. The U.S. Ribeye were very large and prepared well. They came with potatoes which were a little average, slightly hard if we are being picky. Whilst these steaks were good they were not 'fine dining'Desert: menu looked good but we were all full so had to pass on desert!Wine: mixed experience. The white we ordered was served too warm so had to sit in the ice bucket until our starters were already half way through - not what you'd expect for a restaurant like this. We had two different reds, one lighter, one heavier. We asked for advice about what to have with our good and their choices were ok but we didn't get the sense that there was a really superb sommelier on the staff. Service: we had many different waiters and waitress throughout the meal, which made it difficult to build up any kind of rapport with them, mixed experience with them too. It felt like some were not experienced / trained about what to do (picking up plates from the wrong side, knowing which dishes people had ordered etc. which are points of improvement if Alba 1836 aspires to be truly fine dining experience rather than just very good.We also had the owners regularly passing the table to check how we were doing
1
This place totally lost it! There's no longer any italian manager to greet you and give suggestions.Instead we were approached by the owner, and his terrible cigar breath. I asked him advice on wine by the glass, something easy going... he showed up with a glass of Barolo! It was served in a narrow bordeaux glass and smelled a tad oxidized... it seemed to me this person is just trying to score a hard sell, with no knowledge at all. After this, no more interaction.. it felt uncharming and cold environment.Big shame, i thought the food is good

Lovely Italian restaurant.
Delicious food.
Perfectly presented.
Attentive knowledgeable staff.
Relaxing evening out.

Ambience is very nice and cozy. Staff is attentive and knowledgeable.
Overall a very good restaurant with an interesting price to quality ratio.
As well, if you are looking for a business lunch, is strongly recommended.
5
Loved this Italian restaurant! Nice ambience, attentive service and great food. One of my new favorite places in Singapore!
5
We fell across this lovely restaurant at the end of Duxton Hill 2 weeks ago, we popped in for post dinner cheese and wine, we were so impressed with food and wine menus and the hosting and enthusiasm of the Maitre D', Chef Luca and the owner that we booked for dinner the following with 4 of our friends. We enjoyed a fabulous evening, in a classy and spacious environment, with excellent authentic Italian food and wine, superbhosting from beginning to end, including being escorted to our taxi at the end of the cobbled stones to the car park! Now one of our and our friends favourite restaurants in Singapore

If you are looking for a place that serves you're starter with a hair in it and a dessert that's gone off, well you've found the right place.We ordered the octopus salad, which was tasty in its own right, until my friend noticed a hair on her food. The servers took it away swiftly to replace it with a fresh one. By the time they had brought it across and placed it in front of our noses, our appetite had subsided.In terms of the dessert, the tiramisu was sour. The maitre D explained that this was from a previous batch which they had 'wrongly' left in the fridge with the new batch of tiramisu. He offered us a new one to make up for this slip, but again, our stomachs had already turned inside out by then.Front of house should have dealt with the hair and sour tiramisu situation better, by either offering us the desserts on the house or starters at no charge.I shan't be returning in a hurry.
4
This is a lovely space right at the top end of Duxton Hill. It isn't cheap but we enjoyed it a lot. The pasta was home made and some of the best we have had in Singapore. There are some Italian standards but also some more adventurous dishes. The wine selection was good, Italian, with a decent number of wines at (for Singapore) affordable prices. The only let down was the desserts, which were uninspiring
5
Good, wine and service was excellent at Alba. I had the Fois gras and burrata ravioli which was bursting with flavour. They had a great selection of wines by the glass and the sommelier helped us select ones that matched our food, but was also reasonably priced. Portion sizes were good, so we left feeling full and satisfied, but not stuffed. We'll definitely be coming back
5
This is a great restaurant.The food was beautifully prepared and presented with flair.We had delicious oysters and tuna carpaccio followed by veal ravioli.The wine list is extensive with a huge range by the glass or carafe including such gems as the third wine of Sassicaia-a rare find and fairly priced too.The service is highly professional and friendly.Undoubtedly one f the best new restaurants in Singapore.Enjoy

My friend celebrated his birthday and after much contemplation on where to bring him, I asked him if he has been to this restaurant and he hasn‚Äôt. So I recommended him to come here for his birthday. He was agreeable. Carpark was convenient for him, as the restaurant is right next to the multi-storey car park which is sheltered right up to the entrance of the restaurant.The restaurant has great value set lunches, and after looking at the menu for the set lunch and executive set lunch, both my friend and I decided to go with the set lunch. I had the Set Lunch. It costs $32. Starter: New potato and Parmesan soup with 40 minutes low temperature cooked egg with black truffle. The soup was nice. The soft boiled egg when broken and mixed with the soup made it more delicious. Try it!Main course: Grilled tuna tagliata style, served with fresh cherry tomatoes, oregano and capers sauce in fine extra virgin olive oil. Great presentation! A decent piece of tuna grilled and presented with the tomatoes and flowers atop it. I liked the sour taste of the sauce. It reminds me of the gravy that you get when you steam fish with salted vegetables, done Chinese style! Its tangy and gives you the mouth-watering feeling. This dish was well done.Dessert: Sicilian ‚ÄòConnoli‚Äô with sweet ricotta cheese, candied orange, chocolate shavings in a marsala flavoured Cannolo served with pistachio ice cream. I had this before and had good impression of this, so I readily ordered this. You get two cannoli rolls which you break up and eat with the chocolate shavings and ice cream. Its good!My friend ordered the Executive Set Lunch, which costs $48:Starter: Tajima Wagyu Beef Capcaccio, wild rocket, foie gras praline, fresh black truffle and cresenza cheese and Parmigiano Reggiano. This appetiser is to ‚Äòdie for‚Äô... I tried some of my friend‚Äôs appetiser, and it was ‚ÄòWOW‚Äô. The beef was fresh and the foie gras praline was like little balls on the plate. When I bit into it, it had the texture of grounded sesame, but the flavour was unmistakable. The black truffle lent a decadent touch to the dish. Absolutely divine.Main course: Spaghetti with slow cooked beef ragout Naples style. I also tried a small portion of this. The spaghetti was al dente and has a good bite and a different texture to the spaghetti I have eaten before. The beef had two types of beef including wagyu beef and the meat was cut into cubes (not minced) and cooked in a ragout sauce. It‚Äôs good. Dessert: Sicilian ‚ÄòConnoli‚Äô with sweet ricotta cheese, candied orange, chocolate shavings in a marsala flavoured Cannolo served with pistachio ice cream. Same dessert as what I had. My friend liked the dessert too.The manager was very attentive. He had heard me greeting my friend with a Happy Birthday greeting and presented a surprise dessert with birthday greetings to my guest at the end of our meal. The dessert was two molten chocolate cup cakes with birthday wishes on the plate. A nice touch!My friend had a great time and he said he will be bringing his friends down for a meal soon. Highly recommended for the food and service

Recently opened restaurant serving good and original Italian food. A very interesting wine list is available. The place is pleasant in a contemporary well executed wine bar style. Usually in Singapore the local staff is insufficiently trained. In this case instead the performance of both the Italian ma√Ætre and sommelier sadly was not excellent. A pity because the work done in the kitchen deserves praise
