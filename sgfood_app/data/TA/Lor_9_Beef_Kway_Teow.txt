Lor 9 Beef Kway Teow has in business in Geylang Lorong 9 for many years. The only down side is difficult to find parking lot as it has limited carpark lot. You can order other food from opposite coffeeshop like the famous frog leg porridge.

Went with the house specialty and wasn’t disappointed. Very rich flavour, plenty of it and a good price. Service was quick and the place is clean. You would be hard pressed to get a better beef kway teow.

We used to love this stall, but now, very disappointed. The beef is definitely unnaturally soft (tenderiser!) Used to be better - less wok hei taste now, the texture of kway teow is different. The gravey was hot but the noodle was cold , so can you imagine how it tasted, yep, cold dish for us. Price, not worth going now. No wonder we see no crowd on a Saturday night. 2/5. col of dish faded to

Grew up eating this comfort food and since we have not had it for some time, decided to have an early dinner at the original outlet at Lorong 9 Geylang. Parking here is free after 5pm but it can be quite difficult to get parking here unless you donâ€™t mind waiting for a lot or having to walk a distance. As it was early, we did not have to wait long for our beef kway teow and Sambal kangkong. As expected, beef portion was generous and love the tender texture. Average cost per person for the black bean gravy beef kway teow is $6. The sambal kangkong was also not too bad but would have gone down better with plain rice.

The restaurant is simple by the street -place, plastic chairs and tabeles without table clothes. But, but food is very tasty. Long menu offer lot of choices. Service was fast and very kind. I like it very much: delicious food and the view to the street life

This eatery frying the beef kuay teow could have been here more than 2 or 3 decades. The beef is soft and succulent and one of the best soy bean beef kuay teow I have come across in my life. The gravy is so yummy you can drink it up while eating the kuay teow. Whether you prefer it not spicy or spicy, it will not disappoint you. I have been patronising this corner coffee shop unit at Lorong 9 Geylang for as long back as I could remember as I used to grow up in one of the main road shophouse just a few lorongs away. There are other tze zhar dishes served definitely, however I hardly get to try the other dishes because I come here mainly for my favourite beef kuay teow.Please do not expect too much of the eatery for its ambience because it has no air-conditioner and you may end up perspiring if the weather is really humid and hot. When the weather is still bearable, I definitely would not mind coming back again and again for this comfort staple which I have grown up with

Ordered a plate of beef kuay teow for three persons cost $18. The quantity was lesser than expected for three persons. I would recommend you order a plate per person for $6 so everyone can expected compare to a plate for three persons . The distinctive wok taste of the kuay teow, tender beef and thick black bean gravy are the reasons why food-lovers would flock here. We came to this restaurant by walking from the nearest MRT which is about 20 mins distance. I believed it is more convenient than driving since parking may be a challenge

The beef is really tender and the Hor fun has "wok hei". The black bean sauce is thick. They increased their price. It's now $7 for one personal and $14 for 2. We ordered another vegetable dish to go with it since there is very little vegetable in the Hor fun. The Claypot tofu was average. Parking in geylang is a nightmare. We went early before 6pm on Sunday and managed to get a lot.

This was my first meal in Singapore, We had just finished getting checked into our hotel and needed something to eat. I opened my TripAdviser app and found that Lor 9 Beef Kway Teow was just a short walk away.The restaurant is situated on a corner, there is indoor and outdoor seating, we decided to eat outside, we took a seat and menus were brought to us. We ordered drinks first and then looked over the menus, despite the name of the restaurant there is more that just beef offered here.I decided on the Black Pepper Beef, my friend decided on the Deep Fried Baby Squid, we also ordered some Yangzhou Rice to share.One thing that was a little different here and something that I will soon find out if it is the norm here in Singapore is that when the drinks were brought out we had to pay for them right then, it was the same when the food arrived, the plates were placed on the table and you pay right then and there.Well anyway I took a couple scoops of rice and started in on the Black Pepper Beef. I have of course had this dish before but here the sauce was thick, rich, and slightly spicy, the rice was good but my main dish was outstanding. The beef was tender, the vegetables were fresh, and the sauce was perfection.My friend enjoyed her meal but not as much as I enjoyed mine, she thought the squid was too dry. She is from Thailand and I'm sure that she is used to her food being cooked a certain way. I have no way of judging what she ate so I'll chalk it up her indifference to different cultural influences, cooking styles, and local ingredients

I have been a fan of Lor 9 beef horfun for a long time as my grandmother stays in the vicinity. The place is usually crowded during dinner and I only order the beef horfun whenever I am here so can only comment on this. The beef slices are very tender and the gooey black bean gravy that the put on the horfun makes it very tasty and yummy. I didn't give this 5 stars as they don't give a lot of vegetables in the dish and the standard has actually dropped recently. Carpark in geylang is also a challenge and the hygiene of the place can be better. It's basically a eat and go place. I usually do takeaway as I don't like eating along the street in the heat

Went to try the beef noodle with thick gravy, beehoon, seafood yee mee and omelette. 3 of us cost $44 include hot tea. Not bad. We came when it wasn't crowded. Had nice meal and staff are friendly.

Ordered the bigger portion of beef hor fun to share with a friend. The beef slices were soft and tender. Hor fun has wok hei. The cereal chicken is crisp and fragrant. Would drop by again. Drinks are paid separately from the food.

No problems here great food,i was standing there looking at menu wondering if they do take away then a loverly lady came over to help,placed my order 2 min later i was on my way,Fried rice and an omolete two thumbs up!

Their beef noodle is very average only. The soft texture of the meat is not natural... Meat is not sweet...
For the price is fine.
For the waiting period just to eat ? Forget it.

Food is average. Crispy tiny squid is a bit too hard. May be were just used to eat Chinese food. Staff are not that friendly

Apparent famous local place for beef kway teow but it was such a let down with uninspiring kway teow in bland gravy. Yang Zhou fried rice was so so. Fried prawn sauce chicken were alright. Bill came up to sgd 50+ for 4pax. Not worth for the food and trouble of searching for parking lot and the chaos around that area.

Dont know how to appreciate it as many sinaporean tend to say this is their childhood food. For foreigner like myself, i find the beef a bit unaturallly. First it doesnt have the beef fragant and the meat is so tender. Infact more tender than chicken until i find it a bit unnatural. Overall i think it doesnt pass my taste

We tried the beef hor fun with gravy. When it was served shortly after our order, the wok fried smell was compelling our attention. But we were disappointed with the diluted gravy and the 'over - tenderized' beef slices. The meat was too smooth for our liking. And the greens were completely absent.

Been a regular customer for 30 years, food has been consistently good. Good place to bring foreigners for quintessential Singapore street feel, supplement with oyster omelette and for the adventurous foreigners- frog porridge from across the road. Suffice that the Beef Kway teow (white rice flat noodles) is an attraction by itself. One advise - the coffee shop serves drinks in exorbitant prices, eg sugar cane is SGD2.50, double anywhere else. Profiteering from a captive customer base. Hence, rather adjust somewhere else for drinks after a quick but good dinner !

ลองเข้าร้านนี้เพราะเห็นคนนั่งเยอะ แต่ค่อนข้างผิดหวัง ราคาอาหารค่อนข้างแพงเราจึงคาดหวังกับรสชาติกันมาก อาหารส่วนใหญ่จะมีความมัน เลี่ยน นำมาก่อนเลย อย่างเดียวที่อร่อยคือเนื้ออะไรสักอย่างผัดเป็นก้อนๆ ที่ผิดหวังมากคือหัวปลาต้ม มัน เลี่ยน และแพงมาก เป็นฝันร้ายที่สุดในชีวิต เมนูอาหารจะมีภาษาอังกฤษให้อ่านเข้าใจแค่ชื่ออาหาร แต่ไม่รู้ว่ารายละเอียดอาหารมันคืออะไร และสิ่งที่ไม่ประทำใจสุดๆ คือมารยาทของพนักงานขายเครื่องดื่ม ผิวขาว ใส่แว่น หน้ากลมๆ ซึ่งเราพูดทักท้ายและยิ้มแย้มด้วยไมตรีจิต แค่เราถามว่ามีน้ำอะไรบ้าง นางก็ชักสีหน้าใส่ กรอกตามองบน ถอนหายใจ และเบ้ปาก ประมาณว่ารำคาญจะถามทำไม เพื่อนเราทุกคนอึ้งกับกิริยาของนาง แทบอยากจะเดินออก ** Your employee has very bad manner and never has service mind especially a white women wear glasses who standing at beverage counter. very very bad manner. You make our first singapore dinner as a nightmare

Beef hor fun was nice and flavoursome. But the fish slice been hoo wasn't. (Although the fish slice was cooked well)We wanted to order the sambal potatoes leaves but they ran out so got the kangkong instead which was still pretty good. Overall a good experience.

Once or if we're lucky, twice every year we get to fly to the Food Paradise that is Singapore. This is one of our "go to" food centres when we're in Singapore. Usually the tell-tale sign of a good dish or chef is the lines out the front but I think some people just enjoy lining up for food at times in Singapore without their being any substance behind the food for my tastes and although we've never had to wait to be seated here, the food's always been good.Another gauge is that there's photos of celebrities, certificate of awards and merit and newspaper clippings adorning the stalls sign or posted at every convenience but it seems to be becoming more and more popular amongst stalls and not always a denominator of quality.Beef Hor Fun or Beef Kway Teow is a wok fried beef dish with flat rice noodles which are all cooked at an extremely high heat. The skill of the chef is always evident in how they can infuse the "Wok Hei" aka wok's breath or flavour of the wok into their fare and balance that with all the other flavours going on in a very complex flavoured dish.The flavours balanced extremely well and the Wok Hei was far more prominent than most hawkers and the chef has it down to a fine art as it was beautifully crafted on every occasion that we've been here.Overall I think it was an excellent example of Beef Hor Fun and by far the best in our travels. We also had the clams, the sweet and sour pork, the fried baby squid or Sotong Goreng, ginger frog legs and you can also get vendors from across the road to serve you up meals too and had Oluak aka Oyster Omelette from across the road too.Cheers!Dave

The kway teow tasted a little burnt.There was a good amount of beef that came with it.I ordered broccoli on the side which was a good addition as the beef kway teow can seen a little samey.A little more expensive than surrounding restaurants ($16 in total for mine) but perhaps worth trying out if you are in the are

I love hor fun (flat rice noodles) and I believe I have found my favorite place in Singapore. Most other places just seems like the noodles were blanched in water, drained and brown gravy poured over it. Some might prefer it that way, but I prefer the noodles tossed in a super hot wok so it can absorb all that "wok essence" which I can definitely taste in the noodles here. Tried both the wet and dry versions of beef hor fun and both equally delicious. I saw a TV food program and this place was presented on an episode about hor fun. I mentioned it to the waitress and she quickly started waving her hands (assuming I meant I saw her) and said, 'oh no, that wasn't me, that was the owner' ... so humble.Also tried their coffee pork ribs and sambal kang kong - all very tasty. Will visit again for sure

I have found out about this place from a TV show, without a doubt have made a trip there the next day to try.It was one of the best kway teow I've ever tasted. They provided generous portion of the beef, the kway teow was tasty which comes with the delicious specially made gravy sauce.Besides that they have many other stir fried dishes you could try too. Don't miss it

It was a two blocks away from where we stay and I really put it in our itinerary that we go and visit the restaurant to eat the Famous Beef Kway Teow. We were not dismayed as the food was really great! We ordered also for the Seafood Horfun, Seafood fried rice, Lou Han Vegetable, Sambal Prawns and Chicken Claypot - these I did not like the Chicken Claypot that much but it was just okay
