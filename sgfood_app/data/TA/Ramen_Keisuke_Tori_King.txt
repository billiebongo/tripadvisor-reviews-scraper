Very good ramen, super nice broth. Simple but still a lot of options like spicyness level, soft or harder ramen etc. And best of all free flow of eggs ðŸ˜„
5
It did look worth with with the price as they will provide you part of the chicken and it's really delicious. There are many franchise under keisuke and they are all worth the try.
5
Always choose the $5 option with all the ingredients! Yummy soft chicken drum stick, lava egg, vegetables! Service was also efficient, eat and go but they won't chase you if you stayed longer! (;

Do you really want to spend $100 or more looking for the authentic Asian food in Singapore? In a city as expensive as Singapore it is fantastic to not only fine an affordable meal but the REAL DEAL!!! Don't be put off by the line outside...the man at the door keeps things moving, turn over is fast...let's face it...they only serve Ramen...there aren't a whole lot of choices to be made. Luckily for you, all your choices come with their broth...OMG... It is the richest, deepest, delicious broth EVER! I had the pork slices and mushrooms topped with pork belly...Now come on...how can you beat that? Enjoy
4
This has become one of my favorite places to eat when I am in Singapore! The concept is simple, choose a Ramen base, from non-spicy to very spicy, few extra ingredients (mushrooms, flavored eggs, seaweed), saltiness/flavor etc and ready is your Ramen. Service is superquick and attentive. So me and my friends are definitely coming back for some deliiicious soup

Nice ramen with huge chicken leg but I don't really taste the chicken soup, it seems mixed with others. Same as other outlets, Tori king offers unlimited boiled egg for the customers. i had my 1st experience being asked to leave after i had finished as there are too long queue outside. The staff asked politely so we don't get offended. Overall, nice foo

Always noticed a long queue at this ramen place and decided to try it. Ordered their Tori King Ramen Special (All Toppings) consisting of grilled chicken thigh, soft boiled eggs, a slice of pork and seaweed in chicken broth. The broth was quite rich and the chicken was not bad. They also served free flow of hard boiled eggs (they are placed in a basket on the table so you can help yourself to as many as you want). Rated it average as I prefer pork based broth and found it a tad difficult to eat the chicken with chopsticks and spoon without creating a mess. My friend likes it though and said he will come back. Guess you will like it if you like chicken and rich chicken broth.

1st time there with my wife. Ordered their Tori KIng Ramen and TanTan Mien (Ultra Rich) with Special All Topping.I tasted both soups and no matter which one, you will fall in love with it. Their Ultra Rich is for those who loves thick and rich soup; If you like something lighter, go for their standard soup. The chicken meat is soft and tender. Chicken Cher Siew is well marinated. They provided unlimited hard boiled eggs and bean spouts. Seats gets filled up fast during lunch time. But don't worry, if you have to wait in queue, you will be treated with Cold Japanese Barley Tea.Total bill for the above without drink was $43.30. A bit on the steep side for lunch but I have to say, worth the price!!Highly recommend to try
4
I love absolutely everything about this place but the music! Sometimes they play Chinese, Cantonese and or " popcorn" kind of selections, and sometimes, they are pretty loud. I am a bit sad that they don't do take away! Because of whatever reason. So, if I want to surprised my loved one and send the warm noodle to their working place, I have to " physically" go there, queue for 20 mins, sit down and bring my own "tapaw" container, pay and leave! Sometimes staff will " chase" the costumers away to eat faster and so they can let the Other queuing customer can have a seat and eat! You see ?! Why not they have " take away" options since some costumers are willing to have it outside the restaurant, which relatively small seating area. PS: I would still highly recommend this place to everyone. Must try the dry, spicy noodl

Enjoyed a lovely casual dinner here at Ramen Keisuke Tori King... Tori means chicken and so everything on the menu was chicken. Place your orders on the forms ready on the table... select your choice of noodle texture, saltiness of soup and amount of oil you would like. You could also add on toppings such as egg, bamboo shoots, chicken chasu, etc...That being said, we tried the black Spicy tori king ramen and the tori king maze soba, a dry ramen. Love the dry ramen... with its tinge of spiciness, this was our favourite. Hubby was a little disappointed in the black spicy tori king ramen as it was not at all spicy for us though it had a rich broth. What was interesting was that you could help yourself to the free boiled eggs and free bean sprouts if you dine in. Unfortunately, there were no bean sprouts at our table and we did not bother to ask for it.
5
Came here solely for the ramen... very rich in the soup and can end up a very heavy meal...
worth coming and always drink finish the soup though as it is really tasty!
4
very affordable ramen restaurant near the Amara. The soup broth is very tasty and unique. The chicken is soft and tender
5
This is my fav comfort food at its best. There are also of outlets and versions in Singapore but this one takes the cake, and I have proven it by taking a lot of different people here. Free flow of eggs and beans spouts to go with the large serving of chicken that comes with the ramen. Another fav is the Washabi ginger ale, which likely to appear at every few tables. Strongly recommend if you are in the areas, please take note of opening hours and expect a long line
5
Visited the restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. There was no queue. The server was extremely helpful, explaining to us patiently how to order. In front of us were a big container of bean sprouts and a jar of 8-9 cooked eggs. Diners can help themselves to the eggs and bean sprouts. (The server said there were plenty and if those on the table were not enough, he would bring over more!) The bean sprouts were delicious. But the rich soup was too oily though. The chicken thigh which came with the noodles was tender and juicy
4
Thick tasty pork broth with firm smooth ramen to delight your hungering palate for ramen. I usually ask them to drain the fat out of the broth and with every slurp of the noodles and good broth I m in ramen paradise .... oiishiWith free hard boiled eggs and sesame oiled bean sprouts coupled with slices of stewed pork seaweed and bamboo shoot the ramen meal is very satisfying.The cola green tea is highly recommended.After your meal at Parkway parade, marine parade road you can enjoy your shopping
4
Good ramen, variety of flavors to suit anyone; spicy or normal. Broth is great and chicken meat is great. Would return again. Price is worth the food. Try the Wasabi Ginger Ale, tastes like ginger ale with a bit more spice from the wasabi but it's not overpowering, better than I thought
4
Had the wasabi-spiked ramen with the full range of toppings and the hint was wasabi just hit very lightly, and I think it's perfect although I would prefer it a little stronger. However, any stronger would probably have the diner be turned off, or suffering. Stock was rich and hearty, possibly full of collagen. It's so rich it makes your lips kinda stick together. However it's still light enough to carry off the whole dish. I'm honestly mindblower with this ramen. If I was working in the building, I'd probably be a regular patron there seeing as how much i love my noodles. Loved that we had free reign on the marinated bean sprouts and boiled eggs. Also tried the wasabi ginger ale (slightly disappointed on that). Absolutely loved the fave we get to grind our sesame seeds. Staff were accurate and polite even when they don't know much English

Recently the outlet had updated its menu and introduced 5 new dishes from 14th Nov 2016 : MAZE SOBA, Ramen Clear Soup, Ramen Rich Soup, TAN TAN MIEN Ultra Rich, TSUKE MEN.Tori King MAZE SOBA (Dry Ramen) (S$12.90++)Similar to the Bak Chor Mee (local version of minced pork noodle), there was minced meat, spicy sauce and vinegar. But there was also a nutty texture as there was chopped nuts in it too.The noodle used here was similar to the thick flat yellow noodle used for Lor Mee.Spicy but addictive.Tori King Tsuke Men (Dipping Noodles) (S$12.90++)Same as the above dish, the noodle used here was similar to the thick flat yellow noodle used for Lor Mee.The ramen was served with dipping sauce by the side. The dipping sauce was rich and creamy with lots of dried fish flakes and chicken cubes in it. It's signature grilled chicken leg was quite tender but I felt the size of the leg seem to have reduced. I remembered that it used to be quite big. Topup S$2++ for each bowl to up-size.Topup S$5++ for special topping (flavoured egg, 2 pieces of thick bamboo shoot, 2 pieces of tender chicken chashu, 2 pieces of roasted chicken meat balls, Japanese seaweed) for each bowl.With just 2 bowls of ramen, the small table for 2 persons could barely fit in everything.My favourite topping was the chicken meatball which was juicy and crunchy with Yuzu skin for a hint of tangy taste. Similar to the chicken cha shu at Ramen Keisuke Lobster King (another outlet under Ramen Keisuke), there was alcoholic taste which mean that the cha shu could have marinated in sake.Overall the ramen were much better than what I had during my last visit
5
Ramen Keisuke Tori King is one of the best ramen outlets in Singapore, in terms of the taste, springy ramen, soup broth and the meat and not overpriced. It also serves free flow hard boiled eggs and beansprouts. The queue can be long, but good things are always worth the wait
5
I remember my first time in Ramen Keisuke Tori King like it was yesterday. Very polite staff, a bustling kitchen with smiling cooks, and a sense of warmth you only get when you sit down in a place you know will serve good food. One year later, the quality is still there and the ramen is as flavorful as ever. The chashu, broth, mushrooms and noodles are still on point. If you are looking for a great bowl of ramen, look no further, stranger - you can't go wrong
4
Long queue even on a weekday night. But luckily there are seats in the waiting area. Ramen was delicious and in a typical Japanese ramen restaurant setting. But no credit card payment.
5
Tasted most of their ramen stores. But I love this ramen store. I tried their original ramen. The noodles, chicken and soup... was flavourful and tasty. I would recommend anyone to go try this ramen.
5
Went here for a ramen and was surprised how quick service was. The waiter was very polite and professional. The ramen was hot and delicious. Go for the spicy ramen....yummy
5
My friend visit this ramen quite frequent and I not sure why until they brought me for a try last week! The queue is doesn't matter at all! Free flow of egg and bean sprout provided are really delicious. The soup base is definitely delicious!! Must come back restaurant
5
We heard that Keisuke Ramen is the best one in Singapore and we got invited by our friends to have dinner here 2days ago. The queue usually long but lucky us that night it wasnt that long. We only waited for 15minutes before we come in. I ordered the red ramen with strong taste plus falvoured egg, charsiu pork and seaweed. Its the best ramen I ever had and I actually craving for it as I am writing this review... Its a must try, and worth coming back to this ramen place
5
A very good place to eat ramen. I have eaten here a lot of times and it always worth it. The queue would be long at times due to the limited space. You have different options to take when ordering such as less salty, more noodles, with chicken, with pork and more. The flavor of the soup is very nice and the noodles is really good. The serving is heavy and would really be a good meal. Hard boiled eggs and togue are served for free
5
Well worth the money. You can choose the hardness of your noodles, balance of flavour in the soup, add toppings etc. A very tender chicken leg is served with ramen in a thick broth. The spicy sauce goes great with the chicken by the way! Also, I love that there is unlimited hard boiled eggs and beansprouts for you to eat.
4
We ate here on a Friday night at the Tori King Ramen Restaurant, which is located in the 100AM Mall.This has one of the best chicken broth RamenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s I have had. It had tremendous flavor.The place is very popular and busy, with a queue at the door. If by yourself or with 2 of you dining you will be able to queue-jump easier for a seat than with a large group. It is not a big place seating about 30. Service is quick, with only Ramen being served. There are no side dishes available.Staff were very nice - we did love the traditional welcome as you come in the door.Would definitely eat here again. Prices about $16
5
We love this restaurant and all their locations around Singapore. The broth is delicious with the best flavor, noodles are perfectly cooked and the pork is wonderful and not fatty. Chicken karage is also a great side dish. Great value and speedy service. A must try
3
The first time we went here we had a good experience, the service was lively and greeting were very original Japanese style. Normally opt for the black spicy soup which has a nice taste. More recently when we have been back we had only had average experience. The dishes are still of a good standard however the service is more of a formality than welcoming. Perhaps next time we will just get takeaway
5
I kept coming back to this ramen restaurant for a few reasons- generous serving of noodles, fantastic broth, huge drumstick and cosy atmosphere. The interior looks like Japan in its olden days, very cosy but small.
5
Loved the spicy black chicken Ramen ! Make sure to add the flavoured eggs - they are brilliant ! try the wasabi ginger ale ! and do ask then less oil ! the regular seems to be a bit oily for me !
3
If you prefer a "standard" soup base, you won't like it here as their soup is extremely thick. The chicken was melt of the bone soft so plus points to that.
4
You can customize the type of soup base, type of noodles, eggs or anything on the ramen. Which is decent cause I like the noodle soft.
Price is typical ramen price about $15. But there are unlimited eggs for you to eat.
4
Irrasaymasse (welcome) in Japanese joyfully greeted when you walk in at Parkway parade branch.FREE eggs and cold bean sprouts together with sesame seeds in a small mortar are given for you to mix the flavour of your choice. Nebuta ramen with fish and pork broth are sold at S$13.90 abd Tonkotsu at S$11.90 with add ons of bamboo shoots at S$2. I usually ask for less salty and NO fat nodules. Awww what a tasty clear flavourful rich broth that entices you to slurp your springy smooth ramen further.With orcha and green tea cola it complement the complete taste of good Japanese ramen.When you are about to pay for your meal a strike of the drums to indicate their thankfulness of your patronage and return
5
I had their Tonkotsu Ramen and on the first sip, I felt that I was on a trance. This is the closest in terms of taste and the consistency of the broth. We waited for a couple of minutes but every second was worth it. Price isn't too expensive as well
5
Small, cramped and full of bustling energy, this little Ramen joint slaps you in the face with its authenticity.Choose from 4 different ramen and customize your broth , noodles and oil to your liking.From the delicate egg to the subtle yet flavorful broth, the only flaw is i wish their healthy portions were even healthier. This little gem will keep you wanting more and don't be surprised when your cravings get the better of you!Make sure you arrive with a little patience, you will most likely need to queue before settling in for a warm bowl of tasty comfort
4
To enjoy ramen always savour the broth first then slurp the springy noodles to your great satisfaction. Here at Parkway parade and other outlets you are treated to as many hard boiled eggs as you want. A pot of savoury cold beansprouts is also at your disposal. If you want your ramen to be more flavourful then pound sesame seed in the mortar given. Add ons like bamboo shoot is at S$2 seaweed at $1 and if you find the broth too "fatty" request it to be sieved so that you get a clearer broth to your liking
4
- Small place at a smallish mall.- The second of three ramen joints under the Keisuke name: the original tonkotsu and a gyoza place are at Orchid Hotel nearby.- Tasty stock, springy noodles, a succulent chicken thigh/drumstick - a winning combination.- Service is quick despite the occasional queue outside.- Guests sitting at the long table may find the dining experience a little too close for comfort
4
The shop is pretty small so expect a long queue during dinner time. When you arrive, you will be given a chit sheet to fill up your preferences of noodle texture, soup strength, oil level etc. for your ramen selection. I loved the full toppings, with the succulent chicken drumstick, seaweed and meat. However, due to the small shop space and long queue, this restaurant is not very appropriate to sit for long after you finish your ramen. Venture nearby for desserts!
5
The food is super awesome. Free flow bean spout & eggs. However is fast pace since is lunch peak period. Very good for ramen lovers.

For more reviews and photos, visit my site hungrybaker.coTori King is just one of Keisukeâ€™s many ramen branches, but the reason why I keep coming back here is the chicken stock and meat. Most places serve only pork broth, if not itâ€™s salt or soya based. But what about people who do not want to eat pork? (those poor cute pigs). Well thatâ€™s where Tori King comes in.Tori means chicken in Japanese and the creamy, rich and comforting broth here is made with chicken bones, chicken feet, Japanese seaweed and vegetables boiled for eight hours. I always go for the original soup cos itâ€™s soul food! But for those wanting something different or spicier, there is the Green Spicy version (with wasabi) and Black Spicy version (black pepper).The ramen bowls (starting from $11.90) are all topped with chicken thigh, which is tender and flavourful, and you can add other items such as seaweed ($1), super yummy flavoured egg ($2), a huge slice of pork ($1), more noodles and more soup. To go with your noodles are sesame seeds (which you can grind yourself) and a free flow of hard-boiled eggs and slightly spicy beansprouts. The beansprouts are addictive and I can go through half a container.Not only that, you can choose how salty and oily your soup is, how al dente your noodles are, and what toppings you want (spring onions, deep-fried onions and black fungus). Itâ€™s basically a win-win situation.There are also interesting drinks such as Green Tea Cola ($3) and Wasabi Ginger Ale ($3). My companion loved the Green Tea Cola and bought two bottles home.Tori King is not big and fills up quickly; it is usually packed by 1930. Also, the seating style is communal so be prepared to have strangers eating right opposite you! But the ramen is so good youâ€™ll be sure to return again

Firstly, this is a small eating place. Not too child friendly. Most people eat and go. Their ramen is popular for the chicken thigh. Free flow hard boiled eggs and seasoned bean sprouts which I can't stop snacking on them. Extremely crowded with queues during lunchtime on weekdays.
4
Where else you can get a chicken leg and a slab of buta on your ramen than this place? The broth is a mixture of sweet and savoury flavour with the option to choose your own preference of noodle thickness, broth saltiness, and oil levels. Queue is always there even at bit odd hours (2pm) but it worthy waiting for.
2
This place serves decent ramen that the japanese would considered localized to suit our palate. Its not bad but do come alone or in pairs.Unfortunately for us, we came with 5 diners and we were punished for it. We were made to wait in line while everyone else were being shown to their tables. Remember that the next time you swing by or go to some place with better service. Ramen places are all over the place after all
5
Singapore is no lack of ramen places but Tori King one of the best. Been there a few times and the food never disappoint. If you can handle spicy food, go for the Black Spicy ramen or tan tan ramen, the smell itself is good enough to kill hahah. Green spicy ramen is quite interesting with a hint of wasabi but it's an acquired taste, love it or hate it. Each bowl of ramen is topped with tender chicken thigh that falls off the bones yum yum. Not to forget the freeflow cold beansprouts, they are really addictive.Service is fairly good, and atmosphere is cheery with waiters shouting welcome in japanese. Only downside is that the place is tiny and the amount of guest they can accommodate at a time is fairly limited. But that would not hinder me from going back again
5
I just love this place. Delivers exactly what it promises to: delicious ramen at affordable prices. Once you get a table (normally after a bit of a wait), you'll be served quickly. It isn't really a place to sit at leisure and talk with your friends, but as a quick yummy dinner, nothing like it.
5
A thick and savory chicken broth ramen with eggs and beansprouts as condiments makes this ramen diner the ultimate dining experience!I love this place: cosy, not suitable for big groups. It gets pretty packed too. I frequent this branch about at least once a week or minimum thrice a month.I always go for the black pepper chicken ramen, with light soup, little oil and hard/normal noodle texture.The way I eat the hard boiled eggs: remove shell (duh), remove yolk and in place of yolk, a hearty serving of the Japanese mayonnaise plus a little drop of their special spicy sauce and a dash of bonito flakes. Yum!!!After the ramen, get either their special green tea cola or a regular can of coke to burp it all out.(Grossly) amazing! Slurp!!!
4
A new branch has opened its door at Parkway parade offering FREE eggs and salad. While waiting for my ramen I ate the cold bean sprout marinated in sesame oil and seeds together with the egg and first time I enjoyed this combination. My Nebuta tori with fish stock came with its thick tasty broth of pork served with seaweed, meaty pork with toppings of bamboo add on. A g o o d ramen secret is in the broth delicious and hot tasty rich broth. Goblets of fat could be found that gives this wonderful rich flavor to the broth. Used to a clear thick broth I would ask the chef to sieve it before serving the next time.The Awaodori ramen comes with topping of cheese powder, a fusion I have yet to try together with a raw egg and sukiyaki pork and add on of bamboo shoot.Worth going back as the chef have painstakingly produce a very good broth that lingers on after you slurp your noodles noisily
4
Their chicken ramen is a nice change from the other ramen places in the same area serving the usual pork ramen. Best feature is that you get to customize your ramen according to your taste. The chicken thigh that comes with the noodles is very tender and there is a special broth available in limited servings daily. Every table comes with a free flow of cooked eggs and condiments that you can enjoy with your noodles. Great value for money but I found the broth a little to salty for my liking and so will have them down it one notch next time
5
You can choose the soup strength, the length of boiling, oil, and the toppings. So it is more of a customized for yourself. Chicken was tender and the price was great.
4
This ramen eating place is located on the 3rd level of AM100 (Tanjong Pagar) and previously known as "Amara Centre". Easy to locate and its near Tanjong Pagar MRT station and has ample parking. Its quite popular so be prepared to queue. Orders are taken individually on slips of paper where you indicate your choice of soup, additional meat/egg/seaweed. Our daughters loved this place and said that they have eaten this joint before but maybe before they moved to AM100 (they can't recall). The restaurant also provides free flow of bean sprouts ("tao geh") and hard boiled eggs to go with meals. I find the bean sprouts quite nice combination with the ramen noodles but passed on the hard boiled egg as there was already a egg that came with the ramen and its done ramen style where the yolk is still soft boiled and the white hard boiled. Looks and taste great. Still I see other diners whacking down extra hard boiled eggs for fun! Guess they they have a cholesterol issue:)A full ramen meal bowl can be very filling - it came with a chicken thigh, large slice of char siew, egg and seaweed roll. The soup is really very thick and you can indicate the level of saltiness, the amount of oil in the different type of soup base. The next I visit the place I will keep my order simple with just the chicken leg and egg, that all. Will also try out the other highly recommended soup base which is called "black soup" base
5
The basic bowl of ramen, at $11.90, comes with a huge piece of roasted chicken thigh. You can pay for additional items, such as stewed eggs and char siew. There is also free flow of boiled eggs and pickled sprouts, which you can help yourself to at the table. Noodles, saltiness of broth, amount of oil used can all be adjusted to individual taste. Broth was thick with collagen. Good value, hearty and absolutely delicious
4
We visited the Bugis branch. On two separate visits, I ordered the Autumn & Winter ramen. They were both delicious. The broths were just so thick & rich that it would be impossible to forget the taste. Ordering a bowl of ramen is enough to fill me up so I have not tried other dishes in their menu
5
I decided that I should start writing reviews on restaurants I regularly go with my husband in Singapore. I have come here a few times and tried different combinations of toppings. So far I think the spicy black soup (black pepper) is the best broth, then green spicy (wasabi). The regular broth is the least favorite. We think extra pork topping is good but the seasoned eggs are unnecessary as the restaurant provides free flow of eggs. You can also try ginger ale and green cola (wasabi and green tea flavour). It is different. Not my favorite but worth to try something unique. You can also choose the texture of noodle to be hard, soft or normal. The saltiness and oiliness of the soup can also be chosen. The best part is the tender and juicy chicken leg, makes me want to go back every time.
4
I visited the branch at bugis today with my colleagues and the restaurant have given me a good feeling. There are hard boiled egg being served to you while hungrily waiting for your ramen to be served. The preserved bean sprouts is also nice. The pounding of sesame seeds also let you keep your mind off the waiting time of your ramen. The ramen is tasty and unique. Choose less chicken oil if you do not wish to end up with a bowl of oil. The only setback was the service staff. Lack of smile when ordering and clearing the table, and was able to feel the unfriendliness. Around 9.30pm, the staff informed us that they are closing soon in an unfriendly tone. After 10 mins, we decided to leave which i saw there are another 3 tables of 5, 2 & 2 customers are still eating. It gives me the impression that the staffs are trying to chase us out. Anyway, there few other outlets which i can patronize then having to face such lousy service staffs. Do share with me if we are the unlucky ones
5
My family and i passed by the restaurant and decided to try it after going to bugis. The restaurant was different, there were eggs on the tables, and the menu was unique- i could choose my type of ramen, and what type of pork to add in. Also, it was amazing that there was a ramen for each season! I chose the spicy pork ramen and ordered a green tea cola (must-try as it is rare). The food took a reasonable time to arrive, and the ramen was delectable! The pork was just right, not too fat, and the ramen was at the right texture that i wanted. All in all, it was a new environment and a different type of restaurant, special and not like others. It is definitely a must-try! However, it is not advisable to eat at this restaurant in big groups as there are not many big tables
5
Simple style restaurant, just like the ramen houses in Tokyo. But the ramen is just amazingly delicious. I ordered the Autumn specialty with all toppings and this restaurant did not fail to take my breath away. The broth was thick with just the right amount of kick that adds to the flavour. And everything else was just OISHI ! Be sure to try all the ramen specialties
4
So many choices of whether we wanted our ramen, normal or otherwise, the soup normal, spicy or extra salty? I really wasn't used to this, nor did I know what to choose so it was just tick the "normal" box and that was fine for me! Three of us came here for lunch and really enjoyed our meals! The service was swift and when one of our dishes was going to take longer than the others, they came to tell us.Really good decor and I have to say, it felt more Japanese than restaurants that I've been to in Japan!I think though that because there are so many different ethnic restaurants in Singapore, there's a greater "need" to make the decor and "authenticity" of a restaurant fit what they think the customer's perception of what it should look like, whereas in Japan, they don't need to "prove" that it's a Japanese restaurant as it obviously is! Here the waiters and waitresses were dressed in Japanese uniforms and greeted customers in Japanese as they came in!I thought it was a little on the pricy side, around S$60 for the three of us but the food and service were excellent and it really was more than a "fast food" restaurant!Will certainly return when I'm back in Singapore
5
Chef Keisuke is known as the Ramen Champion of Japan after beating about 30.000 competitors in 2011.This place simply wows with the authenticity, richness & thickness of the broth (which uses mainly chicken), tenderness of the chicken, and accurately cooked tamago (eggs).Simply put, I've never tasted any ramen better than this.The interior of the restaurant is also great. With 1970-1980s Japanese comic excerpts, movie posters, and vintage ads on the walls, it does feel like Japan.Just a magnificent place
