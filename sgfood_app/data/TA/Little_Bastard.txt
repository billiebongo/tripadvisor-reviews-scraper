it was a little restaurant sitting on top of Refinery. A very special area and a nice bar. The restaurant is quite cozy and staff is friendly and attentive. The food served is kind of local fusion and I like it. Will visit again.

The service was amazing and the food was very good. I visit this establishment very often and enjoy its consistent quality.

Ordered the smokey cocktail which was way beyond my expectations! Enjoyed the smokiness and pulm. The location and ambience was a another plus.

The portion for the Bone & Marrow is big. But it is so delicious, 1 per person is never enough.The shadow leg is a tiny bit disappointing because it was a bit charred.

Drinks were excellent (especially like the Simply Yeo's!), Shah and Alif were awesome hosts! Pok pok was my fav dish. Def dropping by again soon!

A cute hidden restaurant around the Lavender area. We ordered the swee kueh, beef tartare, charred rice bowl and shadow leg (lemongrass marinated chicken thigh). I'm usually quite apprehensive when it comes to fusion food - it can be a hit or miss - but the food exceeded my expectations! Enjoyed the unique takes on each of the dishes, highly recommend all of these. Only gripe is that the portions are small for normal eaters, so we still felt hungry after our meal. We also ordered the chendol cocktail for "dessert". Not too big a fan of this, it tasted like jager mixed with chendol bits. Service was excellent and the ambiance was ideal - music wasn't too loud, lighting was just right - makes a good location for quiet conversation. Fully recommend

the concept is interesting... hidden restaurant behind a book shelf haha. i wonder how long it will last tho without much walk in traffic. have to say i was extremely disappointed in the food. they have sort of an open kitchen concept... basically food is reheated in a toaster oven by the servers. probably the worst bone marrow i've ever had in my life! oh dear... and the "free" tea they served was most definitely nestea powder... cute tea set tho

This is the sister bar/restaurant to The Refinery and tucked away up a very rickety winding steel staircase. We only stubbled upon this small little bar by chance but glad we did. Having climbed the challenging staircase (even more intereting on the way down) we arrived at small venue with the bar filling most of the back wall. As we were 3 of only 5 people in the place we wondered over to the bar and got talking to the barman - who turned out to be the star of this great cocktail venue. Never before have I tried a smoked infused Hibiscus flower with wiskey and a cricet ball sized ice cube! We were offered a dried prune which is transpired had been soaked in Jagermeister for several weeks - this was a wonderful explosion of flavours. The rest of the evening was a bit of a blur but the flavours and mixing went on for a while, all of which were great. Definitely a place to spend a couple of hours with friends

Found this restaurant on Entertainer app and went there on a Friday night for dinner. The place was cosy and fairly quiet. Tried the pok pok chicken, duck confit, charred rice and shadow leg of which I would recommend duck confit which has the right crisp on the outside.

The marketing was stronger than the experience. The food was alright and it is fairly priced. I believe the menu may expand. Drinks are pretty interesting. The atmosphere is really lacking although they do try. I could see the attempt of a theme but it looks lazy. No complaints tho. Just don't make the mistake of setting your expectations high like m

Love the atmosphere there, very cozy venue for friends gathering. Food taste great with limited selection though. The price is on the higher end given that its portion is quite small. However, overall experience that is still great and will return again

Not too bad. But prices are on a steep side. Could have been better if they offer more food items for selection.

Ambiance of the restaurant was good where location is a secret hideout above their sister restaurant. The place serves interesting cocktails that are worth a try.

Nice chill place for a quiet Friday night w good food. Service was good, price was reasonable. Worth the buck üëç

Food is out of this world, especially the Bone and Marrow. Overall the food is great. The only downside is that the drinks are expensive.

So bad. No joke. I never write reviews but no one deserves to experience a place as terrible as this. There are only 5/6 tables here and on the Friday night we went here only 2 other tables were occupied. The problem stems from the fact there is only ever 1 waiter. In contrast there are 2 "cocktail specialists" and 1 person whose sole responsibility is to support them. These 3 people behind the bar refused to help the waiter (except to offer a tissue because he was sweating) despite seeing that the service was horrendous. If anything it seemed to amuse them and distract them from their phones. I waited 45 mins for a vodka soda. Without lime. And it wasn't even busy! We waited another 45 mins for them to settle the bill. All this whilst the "cocktail specialists" sat around having a jolly time. Online reviews make this place sound amazing. Do not be fooled. This was without a shadow of a doubt, the worst place I have been to in Singapore and a complete waste of time

I visited the restaurant with a gf. We went with excitement thinking that the local delights with a twist food and drinks. But I was v disappointed. The quality of food is poor.. the udon turns out to be yellow skinny noodles. The chicken leg cameout warm not hot. So by the time we are half way into the dish it's already cold. The pork collar is also another disappointment. The pork is also served mild warm. The Thai red curry is too strongly coconut flavored to the extent it's too thick.. and there's not enough gravy to be shared by two of us. Overall the hype of the restuarant.. and overall price was 140. Not the price but the quality of food do not match. Drinks however was ok... interesting mix yet not weak .. still overall rating by me is a poor .. sorry

The bar can be accessed from an unassuming backdoor and upon arrival you'll be greeted by a couple of mahjong tables set within a chill atmosphere. We ordered the Duroc Pork LuRouFan, which came with a fragrant rice patty and tender pork belly on the side. Their signature One Night in Tom Yum is a must-try for the adventurous because how often do you see cold tom yum noodles? The highlights of the night were the drinks and we had the Simply Yeo's and Cheng Tng. Both arrived looking harmless but came with a strong punch of alcohol and the various flavours complemented each other

What a mysterious place - you either head up the stairs via a secret door in the back alley, or ask the friendly folks at The Refinery to show you the way (it's hidden behind one of their shelves).Both the Duck Confit Penyet & One Night in Tom Yum were delicious ($20++ each). The former had a great dollop of homemade sambal that paired well with the absolutely tender duck meat. The latter had chewy Japanese Inaniwa Udon in a bowl of Tom Yum Consomme, coupled with crab meat. It's served as a cold dish; I do wonder how this would've tasted as a piping hot bowl of noodle soup.Stuff here is expensive considering how small the portions are. I could've eaten 2 mains & not be completely full. But strangely enough, after I left, I was thinking of the food for the rest of the night. Great execution, but my stomach is too big for this place methinks.Ambience was awesome - quite lovely place to chill or go on a date. Music played in the background was excellent. (But I was hungry at the end of it all & walked a few streets down to eat some waffles with ice cream.) Ps: My glass of beer was $15++. Sigh. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats Accepts reservations - I used Chop

Had the chef's menu (engustation) and the Cheng Teng cocktail. There were several items which were delightfully great to have. The tofu medallions were excellent with its topping and texture while the crab meat clear tom yum udon was also exciting to have. The food were generally very well done. However the cheng teng is really a small portion of simple cheng teng ingredients with alcohol added to it. My initial anticipation ended up in disappointment as there was the alcohol enveloped the dessert and it was like drinking dry whisky
