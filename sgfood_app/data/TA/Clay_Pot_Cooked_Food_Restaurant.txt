We were brought here by our local guide, who ordered two chicken dishes, each prepared in a clay pot . First, the menu is not in English, so you need someone who can order in Cantonese. Second, the preparation took about 20 minutes. Easy time to kill when the stall is in a shopping center. Third, the result was amazing. The best food - by far - that we had in our almost 5 days in Singapore. We asked for no extra spice, but it was available. The kung pao chicken was the most memorable: extraordinarily tasty, in a dark, rich sauce, with tender chicken pieces (they really know their chicken in Singapore, we discovered repeatedly). One serving easily fed two of us. Can't remember what the second chicken dish was (since we didn't order it), but it was also delicious. The clay pot cooking technique really adds to the intensity of the flavor. This is a stall with tables and benches shared by other stalls in a shopping center. Be sure to look up directions, because we got lost just wandering around the shopping center. Well worth finding someone to order for you. Fabulous
