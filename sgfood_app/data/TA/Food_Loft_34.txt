We are staying 100m from this place that has a variety of food stalls like Taiwanese, Vietnamese, Thai etc. All looked great and the kung pao style chicken was good. Clean and very very cheap.

Cleanest establishment we saw in the Geylang area as well as very tasty authentic food. Hand made Springrolls were one of our favorites

I was walking back to my room from the MRT station after a day of sightseeing, I was hungry and saw Food Loft across the street so I headed on over. There are several vendors to choose from, I ended up ordering Roasted Duck with Noodles from a vendor named Hong Kong Roast.There is a seating area that is covered which is useful when it sunny and hot or when it's raining, there is also seating outside along the perimeter which is useful at night when things have cooled down a bit.When my order was ready I took my food to one of the tables and sat down. The duck was very tender and flavorful, the noodles (which had been cooked while I waited) were cooked just right. The whole area looked clean, I saw an older gentleman busing the tables and as soon as I was done he was there to pick up my tray.The food is good and the prices are reasonable

At 5SGD, you can have 3SGD worth of set meal which includes 1 meat + 1 veggie + rice and get a delicious Naicha or milk tea for less than 2 SGD!Food served here is delicious unlike nearby restaurants/canteens offering the same price. Great value for money. Will always go back to eat here if nearby

Lots of different stalls selling good food at very low prices. I particularly enjoy the duck rice from Hong Kong Roast. I also like the hand made ice lemon tea at the beverages stall. It's totally open with no air con but it's full of fans above your head to keep u cool

Several years ago this place was swarming full of third-world hookers cavorting around with old Chinese men. With a refurbishment & a broomstick most of these hoon women are nowadays gone. The Geylang Food Loft used to have that lively Geylang buzz when full of people, it still has a good variety of cheap Asian food-open 24 hours. There are several different food stalls offering Thai, Chinese, Vietnamese, Malaysian & Korean….that’s food, not Asian pootang but this ain’t far from the truth.Food is ordered & paid for at each kitchen, unlike a take-away store most dishes are prepared fresh upon order so you are given a beeper to alert you when your food is ready for collection. Plates are cleared & tables are cleaned by old people, a profession that is dominated by them in Singapore. There is a good fruit store that sells fresh cut up exotic Asian fruit pieces or you can get them blended into any delicious drink of your choice. There is a small toilet facility here that gets a real workout located near the drinks & beverage station. This beverage station no longer serves alcohol at the Food Loft like most other places in Geylang due the 2013 riot in Little India where an angry mob of hundreds of drunk Indians smashed up police & ambulance vehicles. Many food stalls have had to close due to falling business in Geylang, once a major drinking & nightlife area.Groups of women still sit around pretending to eat but are not allowed to solicit for sex however nothing is stopping you from making eye contact with a young woman in high heels while eating your bowl of noodles. This may initiate her to come around to ur table. If you notice a stinky cabbage & sausage smell don’t panic it’s not any of the weird kitchen fumes but just a Chinese girl from the north coming your way, just turn around & ignore her or like most straight men say you like lady boys. Within sight of the Aljuneid MRT station on the corner of busy Sims Ave & Geylang road right in the thick of the action, it is only two blocks away from the famous red light area teeming with night life activity. The Food Loft is located next to a budget variety store that is open til really late that sells all sorts of junk from underwear to padlocks, condoms & cheap cold drinks
