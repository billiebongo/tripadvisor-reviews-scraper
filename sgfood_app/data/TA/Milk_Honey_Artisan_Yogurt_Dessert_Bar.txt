Love their yogurt and every time we are at MS and Vivo, we will definitely get our fix ... it's simply the best yogurt in town that you should not miss!

Nice and smooth yogurt with endless fine desserts to choose from as toppings. Most of the toppings are handcrafted and unique.

They have very high quality frozen yogurt which is bursting with flavour. I would highly recommend you visit though it is a bit expensive.

We visited their OneKm store on many occasions on our latest visit to Singapore. The choice of toppings is almost overwhelming! We loved the passionfruit and could eat this everyday! We will be returning!

I chanced upon a photo of a beautiful parfait from Milk & Honey on Burpple app and saw there's a branch at Jurong East (shut) so I went down to try it. The store was rather hard to find because their signboard is not really obvious if you're passing by from the other stores beside them. I walk past 2 of their outlets twice while searching for the outlet.This is my family's favourite froyo place. The taste of their frozen yoghurt is just right for me.I haven't visited them for probably a year or more? On my last visit to the Bukit Panjang branch, I realised some of my favourites were no longer available (chocolate deco, Valrhona pearls, poppin balls, "Pocky" sticks made in-house). Not sure if it's permanently discontinued or just not available during both of my visits in December 2017.With so many of my favourites missing, it was a rather disappointing re-visit. Nevertheless, their portion ($6.80 for large) is still as generous as ever. Tastes is still great. Large size comes with choice of 4 toppings. I like their honey sauce, almond and brownie. Maybe I'll just opt for a macaron for one of the choices or omit 1 topping altogether next time.There's a membership programme where you can sign up with your mobile number.

This is part of a chain so the same menu is available at all their outlets.The frozen yogurts on offer were delicious and the options to add and customise then seemed boundless. We tried quite a few of them and every single one was delicious, so if you have a sweet tooth; give them a try.They also were able to cater to my Coeliac diet

They serve yogurts mixed with different toppings to combine. You can choose from a lot of varieties of toppings to add on to your yogurt. They have an existing choices of yogurts or simple combine your own. The yogurt is not too sour and really taste good. Kids and adults would surely like it.

And I meant the distinctive taste in a good way . The taste of yogurt surfaced once I took my first bite of the yogurt , the way I like it . It is milky too . The taste is similar to Llaollao . At Milk and Honey , there are ingredients similar to Llaollao but there are different ones such as macaroons and green tea sauce . I ordered the smallest size yogurt . It costs $4 with one topping . I went to their outlet at Marina Square.

The outlet at bukit panjang is located beside star bucks and is a new addition to bpp after its renovation. There are three sizes of artisan parfait to choose from with different number of toppings. The largest one allows one to choose six toppings, the medium one four etc. We tried the chocolate and peanut butter flavors. Red velvet cake went quite well with chocolate and pop corn with peanut butter. There are also other toppings like corn flakes, nuts, honey sauce, macaron, brownies and the list goes on...As generous portions of the toppings are provided, it 'overflows' from the side of the cup. I like the tall curly yogurt shape that sticks out of the cup. One need to be careful when scooping in case the yogurt 'topples'

I'm not a dessert type person, ie cakes n heavy endings to a meal. But I'd make an exception for this yoghurt parfait dessert (in addition to durian, n korean bingsu and Taiwan Blackball). The honey parfait is a fave of mine but today I had the mix n match, for which I chose white choco balls, orange poppa balls n nata de coco topped with passionfruit sauce which gave the yoghurt a tangy twist. Finished it all. Yum. I believe they have a few outlets n the one I have gone to are at Geylang and City Square Mall
