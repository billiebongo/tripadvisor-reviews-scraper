It was an amazing experience. Foods are really delicious. It is wonderful place to foreigners who wants to try local foods. Stuff was also friendly and quick.

This is the best restaurant in Singapore. If you want local, unique and delicious, you must try this. Just get all the food you see on the picture. You'll love it!

We had a lovely dinner for 9 persons. 11 delectable dishes kept us going for more, and the bill was totally reasonable. Parking was ample. The place is so good you cannot make reservations on weekends and have to be prepared to queue.

Nestled among the housing areas, this is a nice place to have Zi Char food. Realized that it is quite hard to get nice Zi Char in SG, and I’ve been back this place several times. Have always loved the Drunken Cockles & the Butter Pork Ribs with Condensed Milk Powder; their Fried Hor Fun is quite good too. Can get super crowded, it’s advisable to call for reservation.

It’s been almost a year since I visited this place. We ordered cockles, Song fish head, butter pork rib, salted egg sotong, fragrant pork (curry), enoki with tofu. All the dishes arrived within 15 mins. Quality is consistent and much above average. Taste wise, they all tend to be sweet and salty side, appealing to the younger crowd.

This is probably as Singaporean as you can get, with zhi char dishes that you grew up with. We had the coffee pork ribs, fried yam sticks and stir fried kailan, all so simple yet delicious. And the environment is so unpretentious and casual, it makes a good meal even better. Located in one of Singapore's oldest housing estates, this is one restaurant that will bring you on an enjoyable trip down memory lane

Family decided to visit this place again just for the cockles. It was nicely done with raw garlic and little red chills. The portions this time round were smaller but still good. The drunken prawns were good. Fried chicken very good. The curry fish head was a tad more salty but still could drink the sauce by itself. The sambal Kang Kong was great.Services was fast and there was a long line waiting for tables by 6.30 pm, and when we left at 7.30 pm, there was still a long line.

Don't get me wrong, food here is good and reasonably priced but does not have that 'wow' factor. I have tried signature butter ribs which is different from what is imagined; this comes with topped with a white powder which tastes more like powdered milk with a bit of sugar added. Portions were generous but the pork was kind of dry. Other dishes were ok as what you would get from other similar restaurants. Service was relatively fast and staff were pleasant
4
They’re really good at butter pork ribs, very fragrant and somewhat sweet... And a few more dishes in the list are fabulous too, the food here is really a good find. We are very happy with the experience and will definitely put an order in again next time! Be sure to be here early, it can be pretty packed especially during peak diner time!

That's what I think of this special hawker. Not much from the outside, just your average street food facility. But you'll get a hint that it isn't average when you see the long queue of regular patrons.And when you taste its dishes, satisfaction is guaranteed. I recommend the following which we ordered recently.- fresh shellfish marinated in soy sauce and vinegar, with chopped garlic, onion and red chili pepper- honey fried chicken (crispy outside, tender chicken meat)- beehon (simply good)- shrimp omelette - tofu and mushrooms in birds nest soup (though a little bland)High food quality with low food price. You can't beat that formula
4
Good local stir fried food. All Cantonese and Hokkien dishes available. Prices are reasonable. They have their special dishes. Fast service and can be crowded at weekends. Do come early.
5
Very good food and service is fast and efficient. It's zichar and it comes with wide variety of food that you can order from and the portion is big too.
4
I went with some friends. They would not sit you if all parties haven't arrive. Service was pretty fast. Love every dish except for the milk powder pork.
4
Featured here are two of their signatures dishes and our "must have". The butter ribs is served with milk powder ($10). Never seen this version anywhere else. We also love the cold cockles with loads of chopped garlic ($7).
3
Despite the numerous reviews, I found the food to be above average. The pricing is reasonable and if you don't book you most probably have to queue.
5
the food is nice at affordable price. no reservation but q is very fast. good for family dinner or large group.
4
One of the most value for money local cuisine restaurant that serves local cuisine. Must try the drunken cockles , butter pork ribs, drunken prawn, tofu cooked with mushrooms, Mee rebus, fried Hor fun with fish and many dishes looks great ..a bit warm for outside seating but do go earlier or make reservation . Friendly service staff but long q during dinner time .

This is my second visit and the food is as good as on the previous occasion. I do not consider this hawker fare, where you order small dishes from various stalls. This is a proper restaurant albeit in a low cost street environment; ideal for dinner for several persons. The price is ridiculously cheap for huge portions. On this occasion, the cost for 7 dishes and 6 bowls of rice came to less than 120 Sing dollars for 6 persons, which made me question if they have confused our table with another and thereby under charged us. We had steamed fish, cockles, sea shells, and an excellent chicken soup and others which were all equally good. Just the previous evening I paid 123 Sing dollars for 5 modest dishes in a more upmarket restaurant for 4 persons, which could not compare as they were not expensive fish or seafood dishes.This is a very popular eatery, and you will invariably face queues ahead of you. Do not despair, because they have about 30 tables that seat different numbers, and they can incredibly turn around the diners, that you don't even need to wait more than 20 minutes
4
This is my local Hawker. I live and work very close by. The food is very good quality and has lots of flavour. If you visit here, it is best to go with a couple of friends as the portion sizes are pretty big and more like sharing platters. Considering this is a Hawker, I was a little surprised at the price. It isn't cheap.

My Singaporean friend brought me and my other friend here for dinner during our trip. We let my Singaporean friend order since she's local, and she got us delicious food. We had the restaurant's specialty pork with fried milk powder (?) and shrimp with salted egg. We also had a flat noodle dish, a tofu and mushroom dish, and a veggie with three types of eggs. Everything was amazing, just too much! Their barley drink is a good accompaniment
5
simple, classic food in this place. love the three eggs vegetable. cheap and delicious. spend less than $20 per person but excellent array of food
3
Not too bad and worth trying. Overall all the dish is common and nothing signature. In term of pricing, slighlty above the line perhaps due to increase of cost.
3
Enjoyed a beautiful evening Chinese's New Years dinner with friends simple food Ina quite neighborhood. Look forward to coming back sometime. Great food great friends.
3
The food is great unfortunately, I can't say the same for their service.
Even with a reservation, you will not be shown be shown to your seat until you have placed your order. Not entirely elderly or child friendly either.

Another one of my favorite eating places in Singapore. Two Chefs Eating Place serves pretty awesome "Cantonese" zi-char dishes (and one which i got my friends addicted to). Place is small and often have to queue awhile but well worth the queue. Prices are reasonable and food quality superb. Dishes to try: 1. Baby powder pork ribs2. Drunken cockles (its raw... in a way)3. Honey Chicken4. Cereal Prawns5. Herbal Chicken Sou

i have been living nearby to this place for 15 ++ years and every so often hear raving reviews from friends envying our proximity seeing the mile long queues also puzzled medecided to try it again after avoiding it for quite awhile. just like the 2 other times in the past years, the food to me is ordinary and slightly above average..... had the herbal chicken, century egg vegetable broth coffee chicken and cockles and to be honest it's just food to me price wise - very reasonable the gentleman collecting monies and taking orders too was just to involved in the transaction and not any more the relationship
4
Have been here few times. Same style, you've got to queue a bit but not still bearable in my opinion, it moved quite fast.Tasttyyyy yet not so ex. Of cos this is not aircon place, it is a 'hawker' style at a local market at Commonwealth.Die die must try food - my fave: Butter Pork, Drunken Prawn, Chilli Cockle/Crab, Herbal Chicken (if they happen to have), Veggie with salted egg mmmmmmmmhhhhhhThis place is so 100x worth trying and coming back for ! Esp it's near my house lo

Despite the late hour of 10pm, the place was still 3/4 full.We ordered the sliced fish, bean sprouts hor-fanwhich was reliably good; the pork rib was better than most served in ribs franchise/chain restaurants in town. A big disappointment was the la-la. We pointed to the dish on the menu (taking for granted it was cooked in clear soup).Instead the la la were drowned in heavy ala chilli crab gravy which was scandalous! The sauce was just some neither sweet nor sambal concoction and we could n't really taste the la la. A pity.We've eaten there several times, this was our first and last time with the la la done this way

Introduced by our son, we decided to try this eating place, never having been here ourselves. We arrived early on a weekday evening before 6.30pm. No queues yet. Still a number of empty tables. We were seated and then given the menu to order. Allowed our son do the ordering since he is more familiar with the food here.We ordered the cold cockles and the milk powder pork, two dishes that were specifically recommended in reviews online. However the salted egg prawn ball (not listed in menu) was the hot favourite. The salted egg crab was not bad either though at $42 a crab, we felt it was a little on the high end. However the other dishes were reasonably priced. Must say we were surprised by the speed the dishes were rolled out. Guess with the outlet being busy most of the time, they have to be able to churn out food fast!Nice place to try if you have not done so.

Good and delicious local 'stir fried' food. Prices are reasonable too. You can order any dish but I would like to recommend the 'milk powder meat', prawns in oatmeal or butter-sauced, and the KL styled dark noodles. Go early whether lunch or dinner or you might not find a seat. Strongly recommended especially for those who have not tried it
4
Expect a queue. But due to good queue management, the queue was quite fast moving. Must try - Milk powder pork ribs and cockle salad. Food reasonably priced.
4
I went there with some local friends for supper (its well know in the area), was quite crowded but we found a spot to seat. Food was good and prices reasonable.

This first outlet is in an old school coffeeshop located in an old housing estate and you will see their patrons filling all tables at meal times. Their signature dish of the unique buttered pork ribs is a must-have while the other dishes are average.
5
On Friday, Weekends and Public holidays, GO EARLY. @ 5pm if you can. Otherwise, it will be an agonizing long wait for your table, while you smell & watch others eat. Food is 4.8/5 well worth this wait. Value for $, well someone paid for this dinner. Oh, please park properly and put a coupon. The parking aunties are hyper active ther

Came here for a gathering with friends. Reservation was made, but were only allowed to be seated after we placed our orders. Once seated, the dishes came in quick succession!The famed Butter ribs are wonderfully marinated, with the special butter milk powdery dressing that gives it a unique taste. have not tasted this elsewhere. Mushroom with beancurd is wonderfully done, and the gravy is excellent together with the rice.Seafood horfun is good too, if you want to have something simple that warms your tummy.Great place for group gatherings, but expect to wait for up to 45mins for weekend dinner
4
We have been to this place late at night for supper (usually 2 to 3 persons) for a couple of times. This is the first time we had lunch here in a big group of 12, and we thought we could try out more dishes. The buttered pork ribs is unique and delicious, and the cold cockles dish is well received, at least for those who like cockles. The spinach with the usual 3 types of eggs is nice. However, the hor fun is forgettable - it lacks "wok hei". All-in-all, the food is tasty. Prices are close to other tze cha stalls. Previous reviews in TripAdvisor had indicated bad service, but we saw none of these during this particular visit. We called 30 minutes before to make a reservation for a party of 12. We arrived early but the table was ready. After placing our orders, the food arrived quickly. Service was ok but we note that the owner was there, so that may be a factor.

DO NOT EAT HERE!! Well I should say I can't review on the food. Just the experience. We went to dine here and say and waited for nearly 20mins. After being "hassled" to sit down and eat we decided to see what was on offer. Should of known better. The lady served 3 other Asian couples before us (that were seated after us!) and then still ignored us. Even though She wasn't that busy. I tried to get her attention then she WENT TO ANOTHER TABLE and took their order. So I got up. Threw the menus on cashier desk thing and left. Terrible service and the rating on here shows that!

Located several blocks from Commonwealth MRT. This busy and fairly large restaurant serves Chinese seafood and meat dishes. They are known for their Butter Pork Ribs and Drunken Cockles. Both are very tasty. Cockles are extra heavy on fresh garlic so be warned. I also tried the Claypot Curry Fish head and found that to be very fresh and delicious
4
Don't even bother reserving a table!We did that... And we told them we had a reservation but guess what! They don't give you a table unless you have your order through. Not very friendly in my opinion. Food wise it was good- if you ordered the right stuffs. This place is full with locals (and there's always a queue) you know it's goo
4
Freshly cooked Chinese food in simple open air surroundings. Marmite chicken, chilli mussels, butter ribs and egg fuyong are highly recommended. Yang chow fried rice and sambal kangkong were good but the hor fun was unspectacular. Service was incredibly fast and efficient. Great value for money too
5
Just great food and fresh. Real value for food! We ordered around 7 different dishes to share with 4 people. Rock crab, butter ribs, honey ribs, and other various dishes the waitress recomended.. Will be there for a second dinnner!

I have never been to commonwealtharea in my whole 10 years of living here, but I did when I read some great reviews about thus placd, and luckily it didn't disappoint. Must try: drunkard cockles, butter pork ribs, egg yolk fried prawns.... yum....

I am currently here with my family (2A + 2C). Ordered the famous Drunken Cockles and Butter Pork Ribs. They are indeed delicious. We also ordered the Herbal Chicken, Stuffed You Tiou and Spicy Potato Leaves.The lady who took our order was rude. My hubby thought we might have over ordered as initially I had wanted to order a fried noodles as well. She rudely told my hubby ok to order the noodles as not too much. Who knows how much we could eat better? My hubby or the lady?When I decided to cancel the noodles order. Her face turned black immediately.
4
We ordered the salted egg prawns, century egg vegetable, kang kong, chilli crab, prawn paste chicken wings, omelette and braised bean curd with inoki mushrooms. Everything taste really delicious and food was serve quite fast. Just that the food served were not hot enough (no steam from the dish) except for the chilli crab, so it made me wonder if it was already prepared before hand and maybe that could be the reason why the dishes were served quite fast
4
The food is awesome! Just to name a few:1) Butter Pork ribs2) Vegetable with 3 types of egg3) Assam Fish Head4) Drunken Cockles5) Salted egg prawnsTheir service is fast. It is always full house. So make sure you reserve a table before you go and don't be late!

Don't understand what the fuss is about with this Tze Char. Ordered a few of their signature dishes and all were just average. The worst dish we had has got to be the curry fish head. Salty, vegetables were under-cooked or under-boiled. The vegetables were boiled separately and chucked into the claypot just before serving. The fish head was not even fresh.Service was slow. We stood waiting for a table while service staff were chatting with each other. The peak period was obviously over as there were empty tables. We decided to take one table and were informed to move inwards as they had to keep this table else they could face a fine from NEA. As we left, the same table was open again and some patrons were seated there. Oh well...This is my second time to Two Chefs after a two year gap. The food still fails to wow. Won't be back again

Was there in the evening at 7pm. If you're prepared to walk in and find a table, you're going to get a shock. You need to stand near the staircase to first select the dishes you like and place order. Only after doing so will they show you to the next available table through you can see that there's empty tables. They were pretty quick to show us to the table and we wanted some drinks. Asked one of the passing waitress and was told she'll come back but it never happened. We landed up placing drink orders with another waitress. Ordered a seaweed soup, salad prawn balls, double-egg spinach and their speciality - buttered ribs. Must say their buttered pork ribs is definitely a must have, unique from others. The salad prawn balls was also good and they added meat floss as topping, making you want to go for more. The soup and the double-egg spinach was disappointing. The amount of seaweed was sparse and one may possibily termed it as loads of water with some ingredients as garnish. The double-egg spinach was also a little off balance with their portions of ingredient. Nevertheless, their speed in serving the dishes were fast. Overall, a mixed average experience in dinning there.

First visit to this restaurant and it came highly recommended by friends. Certainly didn't disappoint. We had to wait for a table but order was taken while we waited and once a table became available the food arrived soon after. There were seven of us and we ordered ten different dishes and each one better than the last. Highly recommend the deer, honey chicken,coffee chicken and the egg and spinach soup. If you are in the area don't pass this by

Had dinner with friends. Ordered the recommended chicken herbal soup, butter pork, drunken cockles, salted egg prawns and fish head. Soup was good, salted egg prawn was good. The rest was average. I didn't like the butter pork, had just one piece. Don't understand the fuss about this place.

Very popular eating place, so prepare to stand in line. They actually take reservations but still ask you to line up when you come. However, they allowed us to "jump queue" when a table was available. They take orders while you are standing in line so the food comes hot and fast when you get to your table. Their signature dish is the butter pork ribs which is succulent pieces of pork that are deep fried and coated with a yummy butter/milk topping that is addictive. We also always have the imperial chicken soup which has a tasty, rich herbal soup and fall-off-the-bone chicken. For those who like near-raw cockles, this place does it well with the cockles dressed in a sweet-sour sauce and topped with garlic, chilli and chives. The staff manage to remain friendly and polite despite the large crowd
