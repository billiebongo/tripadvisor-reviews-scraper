Never knew soba could be a delicious main by itself. The warm soba here tasted very good, especially when dipped into the pork broth.
4
Served homemade soba with great taste & valuable price. Both dry or with soup soba also taste very good, will definitely come back again next time.
4
The casual restaurant offers a few ways to enjoy soba. Not inexpensive (43.55sgd for two people), but the food quality is consistently good, and serving portions are filling Service is brisk too, and interiors are clean. Recommendable.
2
After reading that the soba was freshly milled on premises I gave it a try. I ordered one *tempura seiro soba*. Whilst waiting for the soba three different waiters asked me if I’d like to order a drink in addition to being asked that when ordering and stating ‘no’.Then the soba came along with some tempura.I regularly buy fresh soba from the Japanese supermarkets here in Singapore so I know good soba .In contrast the soba at this restaurant had absolutely no texture (it was glassy like over cooked pasta) and no taste it was translucent In color too
3
This restaurant is good for vegetarian and non vegetarian as they provide vegetarian options to japanese food that is usually non vegetarian ( soba soup etc)My boyfriend had the tempura soba set and he enjoyed it however the vegetarian chikara soba is a little on bland side as well as agedashi tofu. No complaints though as it's difficult to get authentic japanese vegetarian food. Food was said to be authentic by my Japanese boyfriend.
5
They have nice vegetarian options too. You can find healthy dishes with little or no oil. The soba sets are tasty and so are the desserts especially the sesame jelly one. The sencha tea goes well with the food. The Great World City branch is not that nice. Stick to the Paragon one
2
Ordered soba noodle that tasted relatively plain at $23++Ordered a Bara Bara Chirashi that came with very little fish. Tasted very salty and the amount of fish was ridiculous. $18++ for what seemed to be a bowl of rice.Total $47 for two dishes that were just not really great
3
We had the unagi soba, and paid an extra 10% for the Hokkaido soba; it makes the dish as expensive as the ramen at Tsuta (Michelin star in Tokyo)! The unagi is ok, but not as plentiful or healthy-looking as in the photo on the menu. The dipping sauce is over-salty. In the old days, they used to give boiling water for you to finish off the sauce, but not any more - cost cutting? The cramped place is usually full at meal times, so it’s hard to get the attention of the overwhelmed staff. Soba So Good is a bit like neighbour So Phở So Good - both quite mediocre.
3
Busy restaurant offering different combo dishes often with their signature soba (either hot or cold variations). The soba is made on site and the soup stock is good quality stock. There are also special offers for slots that are off peak like tea time offers etc
4
My first visit to this restaurant and found that their soba was good and portion size is large enough as main course with mid range price. I like the texture of the soba, has little chewy feel to it and once you mix the soba with the broth, it was excellent combination. Sure will visit again
3
Ordered the cold soba with tempura. Texture was good. Serving was large. The soba soup dip small but sufficient. Table is small so don't order too many sides as space is v limited.
5
Love this place, you may encounter a small wait, don't let that discourage you. These soba noodles are made from scratch. You can watch the chef making them. First class food and service. Delicious and healthy. Must try!
4
Not the normal Japanese food, famous for their soba noodle. They serve vegetarian food as well, price a little bit on the high end but the food quality is good. Good for family or small group meeting.
4
Good food! I like the cold soba, ebi tempura, gindara teriyaki, unagi sushi, fried toufu and matcha mochi kinako.
4
Lunch with Ikura Salmon Don. Really fresh Salmon roe( eggs) and Salmon sashimi over rice and really good cold soba with accompaniment dipping sauce. A good generous meal with a bowl of salad included. Soba was cooked andante and really authentic. One could see the master soba stone grinding the flour and hand handling to make the home made soba. Price was reasonable against ramen stores in Singapore! Quite a number of other choices and the menu is in pictures therefore easy to choose from
4
The 5 different kinds of soba served as a main was interesting. A salmon sashimi one, a beef one, a tempura one, a salad one and a yuzu flavored one. Great for people who love variety in their food. Portion is not large but sufficient. Quality is good, delicious and firm soba noodles.The shimbashi combo comes with a hot soup soba and a cold dry soba with assorted tempura. The hot soba tastes great, soba noodles here were slightly softer than the colder ones. The cold soba is served with radish, tempura bits, seaweed and tamago. Mix it all up and it is good to go, yummy! The tempura however can be improve, batter wasn't that crispy and the insides of the tempura were really oily, almost like the ingredient was drown in oil before it got covered by a batter. Service wise was efficient and good. Friendly manager
5
Watch the Soba master make the Soba from scratch, then sit back and slurp away! So light, flavoursome and delicious! Been before on last trip to sing, couldn't wait to go back. Didn't dissapoint. There is often a queue, but it moves quickly, dont be out off!!
5
Oh my God! Buckwheat, Buckwheat, Buckwheat! Made fresh on the premises in a showroom window. Hardly ever find Buckwheat in Frankfurt where I live(d). Actually never! So I had to come here on crowded Orchard Road on a Sunday afternoon.I ordered fresh chilled Buckwheat noodles with Tempura, but they actually brought me another dish, which filled up our table and which I started eating first. No matter as it was as good too! All food was delicious and no spices to be added to it, very well made! Only thing I disliked in the place was the constant elevator music which was a bit too present (not loud). Makes you want to kill yourself or slice your wrists with your chopsticks right after the food, which would be a beautiful finale of my life indeed. But I had to go to the loo right after so expect more reviews from me in Singapore, please!
4
If you're a fan of soba, I encourage you to try Simbashi Soba at the Paragon. The soba is homemade, soft yet it has the chewiness that makes it special to me. Try the duck soba as one of their favorite menu, don't forget to ask the water to boil your soba at the end of your meal and mix with the soup in your bowl; its yummy. This is a spot I always make time for when I'm in the city. Come early too, there are lines building up during meal hours
4
I've been here several times and tried several dishes.Their cold and warm soba are both good, the sides as well.The warm soba comes with soup bases that taste slightly citrus-y, very refreshing to drink. The soba is freshly made and cooked al-dente.The cold soba (w/o dips) which comes with various ingredients are also really tasty. The gravy or sauce that comes with it isn't over-powering but complements the soba well.As for the sides, their Salmon Yukke is really good. It is also consistent in taste. Not once did their standard slide. The deep fried soba also made a really good snack - healthy and tasty.Service here is also amazing. The staff are usually polite and helpful
4
The soup stock was great and will be lovely to have a great handmade soba soup on a rainy day. The place was quiet and pleasant when I am there when it just open.
3
Located conveniently in the basement of the Paragon Shopping centre.
The food was okay, not great & not awful.
The service was equally okay but not great.
Overall it really was an average experience.
4
With its handmade soba noodles and dashi stock, this place is by far one of the best soba restaurants in Singapore. Reasonably priced too!
4
Freshly made soba for a healthy delectable dinner , the hot and cold soba were simply delicious, tasty and healthy with no msg. We had our noodles with prawn and veggie tempura, the entire meal was awesome at reasonable prices ! Will definitely return!
4
The soba at this restaurant is made at the spot. There's a window where patrons can see how the soba is made. The soba tasted fresh and packed a good texture.
4
Choose any of the set menus with 7 or 8 different sort of food, and we think you will be happy. We had two of them and both were of real good quality and excellent taste. And the service was quick, efficient and friendly. The place was more or less full all the time we were there, and that's a good sign
5
We found this place by fortune 10 years ago, and again in January 2017. So much fun to watch the chef making the noodles in the front window, both now, and when kids were smaller. Tasty noodles, fresh salads, good broth. So glad I could reproduce the experience
4
I tried the Japanese Soba (warm) and they were excellent. Along with raw tuna and scallops. Then there was grilled salmon (Japanese sizes!) along with rice and pumpkin corquette and vegetables. All for $25 plus service. Not bad. Really tasty food and excellent quick service. Alot of choice of food is there and its all good
3
We heard that this is 1 of the to-go place if you are looking for good soba here. Like the many soba restaurants we had tried in Japan there is opportunity for one to see how the Japanese soba master prepare the noodles in the shopfront, skillfully shaped by hand into fine strands of soba, from buckwheat flour!! Was there on a Friday 7pm after a night shopping at Orchard Road. Waited only a short while before we are seated. It was full-house by the time our meal arrived shortly after 15 mins. It has quite an extensive vegan menu. We ordered the Chikara soba and beef Tusekemen set. Here most soba comes in 3 different forms (dip,cold or warm). w/o MSG! Taste neither too sweet or salty. A bit disappointed that there is not much chill/cold soba available, mostly chilled-soba with warm broth. It was hot Houjivha brown tea for us but we got the complimentary soba water that is good for your healthThe place somehow reminded us of Kineya杵屋 in Osaka! But the taste of soba was not familiar.We like it that shimbashi Soba localized their dishes and have even the “Laska” and “Curry” version of soba in their Promotion. Kudos indeed..Do drop by to enjoy a freshly, healthy, delicious handmade Soba on-the-spot noodles from any of our chefs. And enjoy the good hospitality from the staff crew too
4
I had never eaten at a japanese place because I associated japanese food with fish. But I found this place in trip advisor, and thus decided to give it a shot. I had some of the best vegetarian sushi i ever.Also the vegetarian soba dish was very good. A place to visit
5
This place is awesome! Extensive vegan menu, absolutely delicious home made soba noodles, which I paired with roasted buckwheat tea and finished with matcha jelly! Awesome! We will be back on our next visit to Singapore!
4
The soba noodles are handmade fresh in front of diners throughout the day. They're nutritious, delicious and healthy. The broths and side dishes are equally excellent and well executed. Service is prompt and efficient. There's even a range of umeshu to try from.
4
The soba, as one can witness, is freshly made. Family favourites include the Yuba Healthy Soba and the Tenchirashi Soba. Try the mid-afternoon meal promotions and the high-tea sets that are served much cheaper than the lunch sets!
4
Another of my family favourite restaurant where we'll go without too much thought. The quality of the food and service is consistently good. Soba here is handmade on the spot and you even get the complimentary soba water that is good for your health.

We discovered Shimbashi when we were looking for a good lunch stop while on our retail adventures. The manager was very welcoming and the team made great recommendations for what we should try. The Soba was perfect and hit the spot. We also paired it with a recommended chilled sake, the perfect way to refresh in the Singapore humidity
4
It's my second time back here, the first time being two years back. The soba is freshly made which I had no complains about, however the dipping broth was too salty. The beef was good which made up for it. My friend's chicken dipping broth was not good and my friend was not impressed with the food.Sashimi was fresh (as per friends) and the tofu steak was pretty disappointing. Chawanmushi was exorbitantly priced at $7 per cup and it tasted like one i could get for $3 outside.Could have been better but it was alright. Loved the smiles on the staff after a long and tiring day though!
5
This was a very pleasant and authentic Japanese restaurant, the atmosphere was authentic and the service was very professional and courteous. Very relaxing place to focus and enjoy the food with good or intimate conversation. We ordered the chef's recommendation (forgot the name, it's their signature dish warm Soba) and ordered the special hot buckwheat tea. It was an excellent combination!! Refreshing and delicious.
4
Till some time ago I thought Teng Bespoke was the default choice for vegans like me who also want to enjoy Japanese cuisine. However, I was pleasantly surprised to locate a new option right in the heart of Orchard (Paragon Center) which serves very good Japanese vegetarian food. I tried the Veg. sushi and the mushroom soba. Both were very good, gave a sense of fulfillment. My wife tried the seafood variety and confirmed that it was good too
5
Great hand-made soba, made right here in the restaurant. Our kids had fun watching the soba chef slicing up the soba noodles from a big batch of dough. Even the adults enjoyed watching the whole process from the grinding stone mill grind out flour which is also sifted on the spot. I'm tired of mass produced, machine made food, and it's really nice to have hand-crafted food at really reasonable prices
5
The duck cold soba texture is tasty, and the egg is cooked to perfection! My partner tried the duck soba in hot soup version but didn't come off as well. Will definitely come back again!
4
The food and service are great here. Loved the soba noodles, sashimi was fresh. Excellent customer service. Not the cheapest meal in town but very enjoyable
5
Visited this outlet earlier and was tastefully surprised that it is almost close to the one we had in Japan. We had three different kinds of soba and all turned out almost perfect. The price is reasonable by such a standard.
5
great food and very quick services. Visited for lunch twice. Noodles freshly made. taste fantastic, would visit again when next in Singapore
5
The texture of the soba, coupled with the rich soup base makes this one of the nest soba one can find in Singapore. Highly recommended for anyone searching for authentic soba while in Singapore.
4
Took their signature handmade soba noodles . They are soft when you chew on them . Soup is a bit saltish and chicken meat has a strong smell. Good ambience and you can see a lot of business lunch take place at this restaurant .Staff are attentive and response fast.They even serve vegetarian meals.Wide range of choice to choose.
2
We have been here a couple of times. The soba is decent standard. The dips are also good. Try the standard soba cold dip, the beef dip, or add on stuff like tempura or kimchi on beef. Chirashi was absolute horror. 1) Rice was regular hot rice, not room temperature. The salmon was half cooked by the hot rice. 2) The chef used a blunt knife to cut the salmon, till the meat tore at the edges and some even frayed. They got something so basic and fundamental in Japanese cuisine so badly wrong, my advise is they should really stick to only soba.
4
We went for my birthday and Father's Day lunch. We need ordered ala carte. Mostly fishy stuff and hot soba from my daughter. Food was good all round. Can't complain. Was it outstanding well no, but good is good isn't it. Wagyu beef didn't look the part but at least it tasted the part. Service was great with our Filipinos waiters doing their best.
5
My wife and I are regulars at this restaurant, having dined here every other month for many years. The quality of the food and service here has been consistently high from the first time we visited, which is why we keep coming back. The loyalty rewards system they have is a great encouragement too, but that is just the icing on the cake for us.The soba is made on-site and the process is just therapeutic and fun to watch, whether as an adult or a kid. The attention to detail of the thickness of each layer of flour and the thickness of the soba tells you something about this place. Collectively, the staff speak many languages, which is important as Orchard Road is a well-known tourist spot. Our personal favourites are the Yuba Kinoko Healthy Soba and the Nishin Soba, both warm sobas, which are comforting, filling and affordable
1
We made a reservation here last night. We are vegetarian and I confirmed that the vegetarian menu was available.When we arrived they told us that there was no vegetarian hot soba, only cold. I am pregnant so not able to have cold soba (and didn't feel like it anyway!)They then told us that the miso eggplant was on a menu which we were only allowed to order from if we ordered alcohol with it. That made no sense to me. They wouldn't make an exception even considering I was pregnant and my husband has never had alcohol in his life. Needless to say we left to find somewhere else
5
Frequent visits, sometimes daily, to this delicious soba specialist. Never gets boring because they serve them in so many different ways!
4
Very convenient location - right in Paragon. And I was surprised at the soba dish I ordered, because it far surpassed my expectations. I expected a so-so sansai soba (try reading that fast), but the soba noodles were full of texture I did not expect.
5
The texture of the soba was just right. I had the Paragon Soba, which lets you try the hot and cold soba together with a plate of Tempura Moriawase (1 prawn and some vegetables)
3
Given that ramen is somewhat more popular and common here than soba, this restaurant serves freshly made soba. They have both hot and cold soba (including the less common tororo soba) as well as some traditional Japanese desserts. An option for a healthy family meal.
4
Service: 3/5
Standard service, do not expect too much.
Food: 3.5/5
Soba is freshly made, but standard has somehow dropped over the years eating it. Still good nonetheless.
Note:
Go with the sets, won't go wrong.
5
I dropped in for lunch, drawn by the sight of the chef making fresh soba through the display window into the kitchen. Having some allergies means that I always need to ask for changes to the menu. Ijima-san, the manager is the epitome of thoughtfulness. He served me personally, checking to ensure that my standard set lunch contained the changes he suggested when I told the waitress that I have some food allergies. What more can I ask for? About the only thing I would have liked would be more distance between eating tables. The service and food was excellent
4
This is my regular go-to when I want soba. If you are lucky, you can see the chef making the soba fresh at various times of the day which is great to watch. The service is efficient and the food is good value although the quality seems to have dropped recently but it is still good
4
There is so much propaganda for how healthy buckwheat and soba is so it makes me feel good to come here. The food is also delicious so I am not choosing this place on health reasons. The dishes are light and their secret for the delicious combination is the poached egg that it comes with. The queues are shorter now as there must have been a drop in popularity. Sometimes not all the dishes are here (which can be frustrating); Having said that its still a good place to come for
5
Shimbashi Soba is located at B1 of Paragon and it is always very crowded for its quilty Soba. Soba is very healthy and Shimbashi is famous for making its own Soba on the spot. Shimbashi in Japanese means "New Bridge" and geographically it is located near Tokyo Station where they compete fiercely for food business. Given this background, the experience at Shimbashi Soba will not disappoint you, however, make sure you avoid the crowded lunch and dinner time since you need to wait 15 minutes before you can order
4
Love the freshness of the pasta and the menu has some decent choices. However did not see any lunch specials which makes this place a bit pricey for daily meals. Has a good variety of Vegeterian meals though and that is a very big plus indeed. Good food but would prefer the pricing to be a bit more wallet friendly
4
You can have a choice of cold or hot soba here, or both. Soba is smooth, and the hot one comes in a nice sweet broth. Tempura however is on the greasy side.
2
Terrible dinner with greasy tempura and tasteless soba noodles. Really don't understand how someone can make a simple dish so bad!
4
I had a lovely lunch here at the Paragon Mall, after having spent a couple of hours walking around the place looking for suitable Christmas presents.
The food was very good.
4
Had dinner sets at this restaurant twice, and we love the kobe beef. We also like the mocchi dessert very much.
5
Found by chance when wondering the food court of Paragon Mall (Orchard Road). Lots of restaurants here.
This place had a separate vegetarian menu and like the other restaurants here was packed. Great food and service and reasonably priced.
5
The separate vegetarian menu uses proper vegetarian broth etc and is totally delicious. The service is excellent too!
2
At 6pm you would think that all items on the menu would be available. .. especially vegetables since they seem to pride themselves in having vegetarian options. But when our first the choices were "all finished today" we decided to just have a taste of the noodles and go somewhere else. So we ordered the housemade atsumori seiro noodles with dressing. Good.
5
This is my go-to for soba in Singapore. The noodles are all handmade and have a firm springy texture! No matter what I have, I always leave feeling completely satisfied! My favourites are the Cold Soba variations and practice of drinking the soba water after the meal to cleanse the palate. Happy customer for several years now
3
Came here for a late lunch. The servers were very friendly and offered us a nice table for 2. Menu was extensive, with sashimi, sushi, and several noodle packages.Both me and my friend tried their packages. Mine (cold salmon soba w/ sushi) did not feel authentic at all. It wasn't bad, but nothing noteworthy. My friend had a larger meal, which included a gooey, greasy mixture we still don't know the name of. The rest of the meal was also very oily, not good.I also consider the price too high for a (semi) fast food restaurant. True, it's Singapore, but $31 for a small set? Not worth it
4
I didn't used to be a fan of soba but Shimbashi made me a convert. The noodles (served both hot and cold) are smooth and always consistent. They have a variety of set lunches which are all reasonably priced. The tempura that came with the Ryujin set had fresh prawns and even a crab leg (not crab stick). It also came with small serving chawanmushi, wagyu beef slices, croquette, sashimi, sushi, dessert and of cos their signature soba noodles. Very good value for money. Service is good. Expect queues during peak hours
5
We are not used to fine dining in the basement of a shopping centre, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this place. Good vegetarian options as well as authentic soba.
4
One of the best place to eat soba (either hot or cold). The place is always packed and we must wait in line.
Dont really understand most of the things the waitress said.
But still the food and portion are worth the price tag.
4
Reasonable price for good soba. Portends go there if I feel like it. Very casual place so it's ok to dine by yourself. Nobody cares. Could be noisy during lunch time.
3
I find the soba here not as good as the one from Paragon. Surprising the salmon sashimi was good!
There were many set meals to choose from. Dessert selections are ok too.
But will go Paragon for the better quality soba.
3
Food portion is tiny for the price you pay. I think it's a little pricey.
Normal tasting, nothing fantastic about it.
4
The food is good. Not excellent. You won't find a beef rice set here nor a fish rice set.
I like their beef udon while my son likes the salmonsashimi.
Service are prompt and friendly.
4
The soba tasted fresh, & I like the range of menu offered, with different varieties of cold & warm soba. They also have sushi, but I went here for the soba. Service was quick & efficient, also accommodating (the people on the next table had difficult requests). Price quite reasonable
4
I'm an absolute noodle addict and just love the healthy options you get at Shimbashi Soba.The noodles are freshly made in a shopwindow display kitchen, with the flour milled on site. The variations of dishes are endless and you can have your noodles in a low-fat, healthy way.The desserts are also yummy, and the staff is very helpful and friendly.We come back regularly
4
I tried both outlets, one at Paragon and the other at Nex. I like authentic Japanese food, no fusion, so I would be happy just eating plain soba with the appropriate sauce/s to go with it. They have this soba drink for free, but staff seldom recommends it. A pity, since their articles recommend highly on its nutrients. Prices are reasonable and hospitality is good. Would definitely go back again to try out more dishes
4
Come here for soba. Nothing else. If you wish to eat sushi and all the other Japanese dishes go somewhere else. Classic soba made simply but very well. Reminded my wife and I of the soba we had in Kyoto recently. Not cheap but this is the heart of orchard road and you don't have to fly to Japan to get authentic soba. Enjoy
5
I'm a soba fan so this place was one of my favorites. They grind their own buckwheat and hand roll and cut their own noodles. I took some colleagues there and they didn't know what to make of cold noodle soup.
4
The texture of fresh soba is springy and it doesn't have a processed taste. The desserts are also made from buckwheat. According to the blurb on the menu, buckwheat is healthy and nutritious. Service was attentive. Prices are slightly expensive. Worth revisiting.
4
Better than those soggy soba I've had in Singapore so far, but feel a tad too chewy.
4
Freshly made soba in the establishment, everything on the menu is buckwheat.. why not
4
Great soba & high teas!
2
Ok food, better looking at the demo from the outside.
5
Our family - my husband, myself & 2 boys, ages 11 & 14 - came across Shimbashi Soba @ Paragon in the beautiful Paragon Shopping Mall on Orchard Road. We wanted an inexpensive lunch that was healthy and tasty - this cute little restaurant fitted the bill perfectly. I adored the decor - so CUTE! We had a table adjacent to the young staff member making Soba noodles by hand behind the shopfront window, so watching him expertly rolling and cutting the noodles kept us entertained while we waited for our meals. Soba noodles are a specialty on the menu, along with a variety of other fresh & healthy Japanese dishes. Our food came out quickly and beautifully presented for such an inexpensive restaurant. We all really enjoyed our meals - my younger son loved it so much, he wanted to come back again the next day for lunch! Service was super-friendly and attentive - what a great find
3
Menu has been revised. Vegetarians can now order a set meal as well. Pricing is a bit high. Worse of all they did not have Sake in Stock .....which for me is a must with a Japanese dinner......Would frequent it may be once a quarter...
4
The outlet my son and I visited is located on Basement 1 of the Nex mall at Serangoon Central, Singapore. Having had a large brunch, we were looking for something light at 3:30pm. So, we ordered the 'special' featuring a small soba and a small bowl of rice. I chose the marinated salmon sashimi topping and my son, the teryaki chicken. We also had edamame beans on the side. I must say that we were surprised at how very tasty the dishes were (OK, the edamame was good but not exceptional - don't think this can ever be, though). Reading their literature about how good soba is for health and how it is prepared helped to whet our appetites. But regardless, the food was great - and at under S$9, exceptional value for money. Other soba dishes start at $12+... shall try other varieties on my next visit.From their website, there are currently 2 Shimbashi Soba outlets in Singapore - with the one at Paragon being the main one (where all the promotions are)
4
So i had always walked past this restaurant... not really noticing it because of my love for din tai fung. However my boyfriend recommended it - so we went one dinner. Being quite skeptical (having had Japanese noodles plenty of times in Japan) - ordered cold noodles. It was surprisingly delicious!! The noodles were the right texture (in pasta terms: al dente) - firm but not too hard and definitely not towards the soft scale. Just how i liked it. could have done with more sauce but was very satisfied! Will definitely be returning when I get cravings for Japanese noodles - was actually craving it today but unfortunately they don't do take ou
