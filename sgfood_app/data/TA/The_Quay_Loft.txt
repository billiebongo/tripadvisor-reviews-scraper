We visited The quay twice during our 2 day stay in Singapore, once for a snack at lunchtime and once for dinner. The Quay is exactly where it says, overlooking the Singapore river a nice stroll away from our hotel and conveniently located by robertson Quay.We found the staff warm, friendly and welcoming. We had a couple of beers before ordering some nachos and dips which were lovely and looking around others were enjoying delicious looking meals so we decided to go back for dinner. I had the sweet and sour chicken and my husband had the sirloin steak. Both meals were excellent and we didn't have long to wait either. We were pleased the restaurant did not add tax to the bill which is the norm in most Singapore bars and restaurants. We would definately recommend The Quay if you are in that location in Singapore

Needed a light meal and walked along the quay and chose this small place.Had the Singapore Platter between us - all freshly cooked, very tasty and a lovely place to pass time in the warm evening people watching. Inexpensive, friendly helpful staff and no service charge added

We visited this well hidden second storey restaurant along Boat Quay facing the Singapore River.The restaurant serves bento sets from Mondays to Wednesdays, and buffet on Thursday and Fridays. Delivery service is also available if you meet the minimum order. We visited on a Thursday and we note that the buffet spread is simple. The spread included laksa, gado gado, spaghetti, chicken wings, egg omelette, mini sausages, vegetables, salad, porridge, etc. Beverages include coffee, lemon grass tea, grass jelly drink and fruit punch.Seating capacity is limited so do go early if you are part of a large party. Do not expect too much from the spread (for the buffet) and you will not be disappointed. It's a lovely place for a meal and chat with friends. The staff are friendly too.
