Ordered mixed korean dishes. No complain on the taste, serving and portion. Only thing its not authentic and $$$$$ for what its worth
Ambient and atmosphere is allright for family dinner. All ordering done through electronic menu which is nice and fast

the place is expensive but its a nice touch to get a feel of koreatown. there are other places in singapore to get a koreatown experience like in bukit timah which is the unofficial k-town of singapore with real koreans living there.

Highly recommend for their watermelon soju and army stew~ the side dishes topokki, seafood pancake, kimchi pancake are tasteless~ free topping of soup too!

Visit this Korea Town. We need to order the food from a computer and take it from the counter. It is very convenient however there are many people queuing there because they haven't decide what to eat. The foods are okay, not that bad.

When you were in Sentosa Island, especially nearby Universal Studio. You guys can enjoy the korean style food in INSADONG KOREAN TOWN. It's authentic

Great place to bring visitors, or to visit! Not too busy place to have lunch or dinner nice korean food.
4
There are selections of Korean, Chinese and Indian food in this food court setting where diners order their food using a self-service kiosk.
Food is quite good and the price is great value considering its location in Resort World Sentosa.

Was at Sentosa for a short visit and came here for lunch. It looks very similar to the Malaysian hawker food street next door, but as we have tried the other one before, we thought we will come here to try the food. Ordered the unagi bibimbap and the kimchi mandu. Both were decent but not outstanding, but overall i felt that the prices were slightly steep for the quality of the dining experience that we were paying for

The Xiao Long Bao is great but the food is not so much. Servings is huge and light eater can share one meal (although extra rice would be recommended).The beef we ordered was rubbery but the taste is okay. It's also expensive so I would suggest people to just look for other place to eat.Location is strategic and near Universal Studios

I have visited this outlet several times for dinner and I always wanted to try the bingsu but was too full. Hence, I decided to try the shaved ice (bingsu) during tea break on a Saturday. So far, the Korean food that I have tried are fine in there, so I have high hopes for the bingsu since it is a Korean restaurant. We ordered the Mango shaved ice as it is chef's recommendation as stated. The price written as S$12 but was S$13 during payment as there was a 1% service charge and 7% GST plus a round up to nearest 10cents.The ice was rough and unlike snow kind. There was no milk on it. Basically, it's shaved ice below the Mango and a scope of ice cream. It's unlike the normal bingsu that I have tried in many places. I have high expectations as it is afterall a Korean restaurant. But the shaved ice was rough and like ice kacang in hawker centre. Disappointed.

Food was not out of the world and as expected, was a bit pricey due to its location. Lucky to meet 2 service staff whom were really friendly and courteous. Seating area was comfortable.

Bulgogi beef stew was like a soup. Didn't taste Korean was expensive. Felt like it was a fast food joint

Price is not cheap and it's not really very authentic Korean food. If time is not an issue, you might want to pop by Vivo City instead.

They sell all kinds of Korean street foods and delicacies, must try and Korean games too. You will hear k-pop songs along the halls. You will enjoy if you love kpop. :)

We are here 3 times. Food is really good and there are many options to choose from. You order and pay at the ordering machine, which is also convenient. Great spot for eating on budget!

We decided to try korean food here after visiting the trick eye museum. The self ordering kiosk was a bit confusing since we couldn't read korean and ended up ordering from the cashier instead. Ordered one noodle with black sauce and a hotpot bimbimbap. Both were excellent.

I must say that it's not easy to find good Korean food at a tourist area. I love seafood tofu soup. It's a must have for me whenever I do Korean food. By far, this is one of the best I have ever had in Singapore. The clams n prawns r big n fresh! The entire bowl of soup is flavorful n not too spicy. Just right. One ramen with beef + one seafood tofu soup + 8 pieces of fried chicken + 1 drink = $35. Not too bad! We will surely go back again.

We were 3 families, with both Veg & Non Veg preferences. Luckily for Vegetarians, there was a counter of Kurry Korner, and of course for Non Veg multiple choice was available.For Dessert we ordered sizzling chocolate brownies, they took time to prepare, but the dish was excellent and the helping was generous

Diners are required to use a self-service kiosk to order food and make payment DIY before bringing the receipt to the various counters to collect your food. It is a pleasant setting, although functions more like a cafe or higher end food court. Food served is not elaborate but simple and easy to prepare stuff. It has Korean, Chinese and Indian food available. Prices are a little bit more expensive than food court but not exorbitant considering it operates on the grounds of Resorts World

Insadong Korea Town is like a food court where you can buy different Korean food. Beside it, there's a Malaysian version as well. Anyway, so they have a menu, you order from one counter and then you will get your food from different stalls. We weren't really that hungry so we just bought some snacks. We bought dukbokki, bingsu and banana fritters. I still prefer Cafe Seolhwa's bingsu though. Nobody beats their super fine snow-like ice! This is quite a unique food experience though

I tried their desserts coz its alluring in ther posters. the banana fritter is so so... But Im glad i tried J cone. It tastes good :)
5

Went with my 2 kids. We had a baked rice, spaghettis, bulgogi set and 2 desserts and cost about $60. The quality of food is good and my kids liked it very much. Good price for a self service restaurant.
4
The menu spread is good and a lot of variety. Price is reasonable considering in RWS.
The only troublesome part is having to collect the food ourselves and sometimes it can be a bit heavy.
2
Went cos space available. Menu looks really cool. But disappointed with the food... its like paying slightly higher than foodcourt price but lower than foodcourt standard.
3
we ordered 2 cold buckwheat noodle (냉면), 1 kimchi pancake and 1 beef hotplate with rice, and it costs sgd 49 in total. overall, food was cooked quite healthily and not too oily nor salty (only to avoid the streetfood station - it's pretty oily). the concept of a dedicated korean "food-junction" is refreshing, the crowd isn't too large at mealtimes, otherwise the seating space may not be large enough to hold a typical peakhour lunchcrowd

We spent the day in Sentosa Island. We visited S.E.A. Aquarium and immediately after, it was time for lunch. Korea Town is unique since you come in, order on an automated kiosk, obtain a receipt, then drop off the receipt to the numbered stations based on the number printed on the receipt itself. Once you drop off the receipt, they provide you a pager to notify you to pick up your food. The Korean food was definitely tough to beat and comparable to a sit down restaurant while this is considered as fast food

The menu is displayed overhead once you step in. Ordering is via the touchscreen, self-service kiosks. Ordering is simple and straightforward, and quick. The machine prints out your order chits, which you have to hand over to the respective food counters (sorted by type of food) and await for your orders with an electronic beeping device. It can get quite messy during peak period (dinner and weekends). The food served is pretty authentic, but I would be able to get it much cheaper on mainland Singapore. The seating arrangements are very much favourable for large groups, so it was a good option for families and large groups who cannot get a large enough table anywhere else in RWS. Note: If you have an RWS Invites card and you wish to chalk up rebates on it, you can ONLY order manually at the service counter, which usually takes much longer than the self-ordering kiosk

We went there after being to Adventure Cove with the kids and we found there some inexpensive and quick food. There are many options (not only Korean) and you can order through the machine (although you need a little time to understand how they work). Food is fast good portions and taste (in general) and you can feed a family of four without breaking the bank which is not bad considering that you are in Sentosa
