They added magic in the sauce. It even made the cucumbers taste good. Simply divine. Me and my colleagues favourite duck rice stall.

This stall has a long-standing reputation for its braised meat. While it used to be roast goose, these days it's the duck. while we found the flesh to be well cooked in the braising liquid and tender to the bite, this stall also serves up delicious pig head. The meat is a mixture of soft, thick and glutenous skin with pork flesh flavored and colored by the braising stock. A portion at $10 can easily be shared by 3 adults. Quantities are very limited and sell out even before lunch. Get there for an early lunch if you want to enjoy a portion of this well-braised meat

Though the braised duck sold in Heng Gi is not the roast goose it was famous for in the past , one can be assured of a fresh bird , reasonably succulent if you get the upper thigh or even the breast meat .Ducks do not yield much meat and Heng Gi makes the best of what can be made of it .The sides, including the soy bean cake are really the best because of the tasty braising sauce but they refuse to sell more than a couple with each order.Just a nostalgic joint which has it's followers but there are not a lot of places which still sell braised duck in Singapor

This goose and duck rice stall at 01-335 Tekka Centre, 665 Buffalo Road was featured in the CEOsâ€™ choice book 2010. How wrong could a bunch of CEO get? Brilliant at corporate strategies and decisions, this distinguished group of intellect got it horribly wrong at picking Heng Gi.The duck and goose were braised (not roasted as the signboard says) The meat was tough and dry. The sauce was bland. The chilli sauce was sourish. The price was expensive (perhaps only catering for CEOs?) Value for money was NIL.Avoid this place like the plague. (www.perfyi.wordpress.com
