The Writers Bar and Grill.
Did we dine with Noel Coward?
Was Hercule Poirot on the next table?
Obviously not - but it felt as if they could have been.
Relaxed fine dining with an air of sophistication.
Superb.

Lunch in restaurant with nostalgic Colonial ambience. Lunch menu is simple and tasty. Great service.

Great ambiance touched with history in the bar, probably one of the homes of the Singapore Sling, but boy do they charge you for the experience. Food nice, but again costly. Make it a special ocassion.

We had out Singapore Sling in the Writers Bar at Raffles because we wanted to make a request to the pianist. This worked very well - lovely cocktails and service. We got our song played which was romantic. The courtyard of the hotel is lovely. Most people go to the Long Bar which is more lively.The shop is good and you can write a postcard there and post it

After coming back to a hotel on Monday night, especially after a heavy meal, we were looking for a place to chill and enjoy our digestive. Designed right next to the main lobby, the Writer's Bar seemed liked an appropriate place, as not many people were there. I have to say that Ludeth (assistant restaurant manager) made probably the best campari orange I have tried to date. Either because of the type of the oranges, the ratio or something else, but it was an absolute balance in flavors (the bitterness of campari and the sweetness of orange). The roasted cashews were also a great snack

Raffles is a beautiful hotel in the British colonial style and popular as a tourist site for high tea or one of their famous "Singapore Sling" cocktails, which is encouraged by the hotel's website. However, the colonial attitude seems to have gone a bit too far. If you are a guest of the hotel, I have no doubt you are treated like royalty. But as a tourist just to have a look around, you get the flavor of how the colonialists treated the "locals". Despite some question about the availability of the Writer's Bar, my friend and I decided that it MUST be open to the public since the website is quite clear about other parts of the hotel not being so, as well as it's historical importance. When we first arrived, we asked about the Writer's Bar and the gift shop and were told where they both were. We elected to go to the gift shop first and when we came back toward the front, suddenly the Writers Bar is for residents only. What? Why? "Because they don't have any other place that is all their own." Um, their ROOMS? And who the hell expects to have a place "all their own" in a tourist-attraction/hotel?? SO annoyed. Like every other stupid schmuck, we made our way to the Long Bar and paid $84 SGD!!!! for the consolation of two Singapore slings and some free peanuts. Never, ever again. If you're not staying at this hotel -- not worth the money or aggravation. Support establishments that actually welcome tourists - there are so many of them! And leave these sad relics to the loneliness of their outdated, elitist notions of a world best left in the past

Having had enough of expats in the Long Bar we headed for the Writers Bar for a whisky. It's pricey ( $20 + for a whisky ) but the atmosphere is priceless. Enjoyed chatting to Reuben at the bar as he detailed some great anecdotes from Raffles' long and fascinating history.

Staying at the hotel could not wish for a better place to have a drink..located in the classic setting of the superb lobby of the Raffles Hotel. Solid dark wood bar, high stools and glass fronted cabinets with a great choice of premium scotch and cognac to choose from....only hotel guests, no walk ins and dress code observed.Great atmosphere and you get the sense that you are indeed sitting where the great writers, Kipling, Somerset Maugham and Hemmingway were inspired to write..A couple of Singapore Slings may have helped as well...

Relaxing with good friends together, listening to the excellent performance of the pianist lady you get inspired for your writing or a new endeavor. We had an excellent appetizer and the service personal explained us how the Singapore Sling came into being, explained the surroundings and were very friendly and created with their service a friendly atmosphere. The Writers Bar is located in the lobby of the Raffles hotel, as a tribute to the writers who have stayed here or have written about it. Sublime, elegant, refined

My dining experience in the Writers Bar at Raffles hotel was both pleasant and a disappointment. The atmosphere and company were excellent and the attention to detail of the staff also of the highest order. My wife, daughter, partner and I spent a most enjoyable evening celebrating a birthday. My evening, however, was marred by the standard of food served and the exhorbitant prices of what I considered to be an average restaurant meal of three courses. My most disappointing thing was the main course. I had of duck breast. It was totally overcooked to the point where the skin was charcoal and tasted thus.and therefore inedible. The wine list was again a disappointment as I can only assume the sommelier was French and had not heard of the excellent wines from around the world. 1 South African red (Stellenbosch) and 1 New Zealand white (Marlborough) and the same for Chile, Argentina and others.
