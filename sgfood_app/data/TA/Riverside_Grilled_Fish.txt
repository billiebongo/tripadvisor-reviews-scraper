Specialises in large fish meals. Nice presentation, guite hot/spicy. Somewhat varying quality, but quite good if you are into this kind of food. Ended up eating there several times.

We tried this dish several times during our visit to Guangzhou last year and thoroughly enjoyed the chili and spicy taste. Then we chanced upon Riverside Grilled Fish in Raffles City. We ordered the standard fish with enoki mushrooms and lotus root as add on. We chose the lowest level of chili. I must say they recreated the same authentic taste as that in Guangzhou. The portion was more than enough for 2 persons without any other dishes. Staff were attentive and courteous. It was an enjoyable experience. Thumbs up.

An interesting experience where you chose your dishes from an I pad. We chose the option of not so spicy fish which was more than enough for most western palates. The fish was nice but a bit overdone. That was compensated for by the excellent vegetable fried rice and well cooked veg.A popular place and I would definitely go there again to try the other sauce selections.

Come for more than the fish! While visiting Singapore, we stopped into this restaurant since we found it to be more interesting than the Din Tai Fung at the end of the hall. Since we like spicier foods, we found ourselves more or less in the right place.Ambiance was darker/intimate at dinnertime, moderate noise level at peak time, and the crowd had almost no tourists. You place your order by using an iPad-like device while eating unshelled sunflower seeds.We ordered the following items: pan fried shredded (scallion) pancake, dumplings in chili oil (pork/shrimp), Szechuan Flat Noodles (served cold), and La Mian with Minced Pork & Black Beans (a noodle dish). Although impressive, we wanted less food than the fish.Being somewhat experienced foodies, we found everything to be amazingly well-made and flavorful. Being shredded, the pancake was easy for groups to eat. The only non-spicy dishes were the pancake and the La Mian. Easily the spiciest were the flat noodles...so spicy, that we couldn't finish it (and we'd go for Beijing Style Chilled Noodles for less spice next time). Our favorite were the dumplings--so good in fact, that we ordered a 2nd round. They were incredibly silky.Ironically, many of the dishes we ordered here happen to be some of the more sought-after choices in Szechuan places in the US. Guess we got lucky?Service was efficient, nothing to write home about. Our total came out to be ~$45SGD and we saved no room for dessert

We were looking for a nice decent lunch and wanted to go to Din Tai Fung, but the line was too long . Next door looked very appealing and lots of seats were available so we decided to give it a try. But it was not the right choice although we didn't have any of their fish dishes as they pretty large .we had sweet and sour soup w noodles and dumplings and green veggies with peanut spice which I always eat in Shanghai. The later was so utterly disappointing as they have just used the sesame sauce from a bottle ... the soup was very average. Sorry next time I am happy to wait next door .

Riverside Grilled Fish - This restaurant is an offshoot from the branches in China, and the standards hold up pretty well. This was our second trip and the grilled fish of seabass in 'fragrant sauce' doesn't disappoint. We also managed to tried the 腊味炒饭 and it really provided a good contrast to the more punchy fish. Service was good and we were pretty satisfied

Visit the outlet over weekend. Was surprised not to see a crowd for lunch. Maybe already was late at 1pm. Am glad to try out the restaurant as the food especially the grilled fish was very good and authentic. But for those who can't takr spicy fiod, do not order the original flavour. Other dish ordered was the chicken dish which had a nice aroma. Will be back there again

The signature spicy grilled fish tasted really good. We are glad we asked for less spicy and it came out just right. Otherwise it may be overpowering for some. This dish goes very well with steamed or fried rice. The braised chicken dish was also delicious. Service was good and we didn't have to wait very long for our food
