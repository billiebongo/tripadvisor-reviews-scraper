Located at far end mallHad better Chinese than thisWatch what you use and eat as you will be stung on bill. Including hand wipes, complimentary nuts that you are then charged for, service fee, basically increased additional $10.Food is nice but not 5 star. Wheelchair access easy if on large banquet table, otherwise too narrow between tables. Ask restaurant if they would assist to provide easiest table if you book in advance

My family and I just went to the Marina Bay Link Mall Paradise Classic for our dinner. When we reach there, we were very warm welcome with the staffs and be seated comfortable. We enjoyed the home make water chestnuts drink which either hot or cool. We ordered some of the new dishes which just launched recently. It worth to visit

I was at Sun Tec City and doing the normal walk around looking for possible dinner places. Paradise had a poster board with different selections. I spied several dishes that looked good. Came back for dinner. Shirley was my waitress. She took time to explain the different options. I chose sweet and sour pork. It was very good. I had white rice with it. Observations. They didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have table napkins. She said this was customary. There was a wet nap on the table, it was added to the bill. $0.30.After dinner, she brought a complimentary jello plate that had orchids in the jello. The bill included a %10 service charge.Food was very good, service was friendly and fast

Paradise Classic dishes such as seafood fried rice and chilled ice jelly are my kids favourite. The mayonnaise pork chop was well executed too.

Mass produced tasteless food. Quantity but lacking quality. Price reflects that. Will not be rushing back.

Food standard has dropped badly. Service was terrible . Can't find an excellent staff. All can't smile and when being asked for something no response so don't know they understand or not . No complimentary starter as stated in the order chit . Horrible ! It has never been like that before .

Had just landed back in Singapore and we were craving some good local food.Stumbled upon this place whilst looking for the Suntec food court.Line up outside shows it is popular.What a treat, fantastic food.Fried rice, yum, prawns in salted egg yolk, delicious, beef with ginger and spring onions, very tasty, sweet and sour pork was homely.Recommend this place as the prices are good, food tasty and service very friendly.If only two of you eating, go for small portions, medium sized ones are quite big!

Around the fountain area of suntec city, i assume this is part of the large and expanding paradise restaurant group. Mid-tier and caters to working crowd and tourists. Ordered the food and it took too long to come, at least 35mins. The hotpot tofu , sweet and sour pork, bittergourd with fried egg were good. Prawn with wasabi is almost o

Ordered the mayonnaise prawns, salted radish egg omelette, sambal kangkong and pig stomach soup. The soup was very salty and does not taste like pig stomach soup. Prawns and omelette was average and only the veggie turned out pretty well.Staff are friendly and apologetic when the lunch crowd slowed down the serving of the dishes.Expensive lunch that costs about $70 for 2 pax, considering the type of dishes ordered. Do make a reservation as it is full house by 12:30

There are several ways to get to this branch located at the Marina Bay Link Mall...one is via MRT and the other above ground. Either way, depending on the weather and where one is coming from, it's pretty accessible. First, reservations are encouraged especially during during work-week lunch hour. The placed gets packed quickly. Service was quick, friendly and accommodating despite the crowd. The concern was the food. To be fair - it was good. We had bitter gourd, fried tofu, beehon noodles braised fish and fried rice. However, there should be truth to advertising here. The actual was nowhere remotely near what was marketed. Not so much of an issue except our expectations were not managed well. Price was competitive - roughly SG30 per person....a good deal, if you ask me.
