Delicious Korean food! Our kids also loved the BBQ Green Tea Pork Belly, Ginseng Chicken Soup (taste was really nice and not reminding one of ginseng), Beef Bulgogi and Spicy Tofu Seafood Soup. Now they are ready to visit Korea :)

Seeing good review online and long queue each time we passed by and finally decided to give it a try. Yes authentic perhaps as run by Korean. However, compared to many other Korean outlets taste was very bland. Ordered spicy beef soup but bland, diluted and beef super tough. Beef kimchi bimbap again bland as very little kimchi with miserable dry meat. Pork squid hot plate taste bland again though squid was fresh but pathetic meat portion. Seafood kimchi pancake (last to serve) again very bland and found hair in the pancake when almost finishing. Already unsatisfied meal but worst of all, disgusted by the hair. Showed to the staff and staff offered to replace but I rejected. No initiative to waive off service charge despite the ordeal except free ice-cream that my son wanted to buy from the chiller placed at the entrance near the cashier. Did not bother to ask for discount as definitely no more next visit

Had the pork BBQ, ginseng chicken and the pork sushi roll. We don't usually try Korean food but this one is our Favourite. The BBQ pork was succulent and tender, while the ginseng chicken soup was fragment and slurpy good. The pork sushi was a good starter while waiting for the pork to be bbqed.

Patronised the restaurant with friends and family on two separate occasions of late. The food ranging from BBQ meat, army stew, rice cake, glass noodles to side dishes were tasty. The lady boss appeared genuine in serving customers. However most of the crew especially the male supervisor were very task oriented. The latter had no qualms hurrying customers to make last order, finish eating, etc as it is near closing/rest hour. Visit by avoiding closing hour so that you would not be disappointed by lack lustre service

We frequent Hansik regularly as it is near our house. It is amazing to have a good authentic Korean restaurant in the northeast! We love the bbq meats, the haemul pajeon, the doenjang jjigae, the yukgaejang, the naengmyeon etc etc... We have tried most of the items on the menu. Do go early to avoid the queue (especially during dinner)

I must say this is the best Korea food that I have tried in Singapore. The restaurant is located in heartland mall in kovan, not a tourist shopping mall though. There is always a long queue during dinner time but waiting time is still quite fast. The varieties are good with many selection of authentic Korean food. We have ordered chicken mushroom hotpot, they have taken our order during queuing which is good and not wasting any time. They will serve some small side dishes which are refillable that include kimchi, vegetables, ikan billis.....etc The hot pot is served fast and the portion is big, the chicken is a lot and the ginseng soup is good. I will definitely visit again to try out other main dishes, highly recommende

Been to Hansik twice. We tried the Jjampong, seafood pancake, chicken bulgogi and kimchi stew. The Jjampong is a must try for spicy food lovers, not for the faint hearted though. All very well prepared and tasty. The chanpon (side dishes) are all very good too. Refillable when asked and good variety each time we were there. Prices are affordable, considering not the quality. Be prepared for queues in this heartland eatery!

Our family dinner brought us to hansik Korean restaurant this week, the place is quite crowded . Waited a while in the queue. We were seated well and the hot pot soup was marvellous , the Ian cakes were delicious . It's a real authentic Korean dinner with Kim Chee service on the table before the food arrive . All of us really enjoyed the place and the food served. Recommended

There are many good seats in the restaurant with an excellent view of the street en lovely trees. The restaurant has an excellent choice of meat for the buffet Korean BBQ

Had lunch here with my gal pals on Sunday. Some queuing is needed as the restaurant is a small family-run outfit. Reservations are highly recommended if you have a big group. The food is phenomenal for a restaurant that claims no usage of MSG in its cooking. We had 2 soups- beef ribs soup- spicy tofu seafood soupBeef rib soup is very flavourful with soft and succulent meat hanging from the bones. The spicy tofu soup is very addictive. You can taste the seafood Flavours very distinctly and I don't detect any MSG used. Fantastic!Finally we had the beef bulgogi with rice. Delivered in taste and presentation!The service was efficient and the place clean. Overall a good place for friends and family dinners but do note that there are only max 15 tables catering to varying sizes there so queues are expected.

Today, I invited my very old classmate (since primary 1) to the Hansik Korean Restaurant at Heartland Mall, level 2. We ordered the ginseng chicken soup and the spicy beef soup which comes with rice and we also ordered crushed pear juice. The meal was sumptuous and the pear juice was refreshing. We enjoyed ourselves very much and the service is good. I would recommend this place to my family and friends

My family enjoyed our dinner at Hansik though we would have appreciated it if they refilled the small plates.. The service was polite and prompt. We didn't wait long for the food though we waited a short while for our table. The restaurant doesn't take reservations.I went home spelling of bbq; wish something could be done about it.

I have been to this korean Restn a few times and food has been consistently good. What's disappointing is the poor service level. The staff there don't seem to be happy to serve. In fact, it shocked me to see them with black faces. Ask for more kimchi but used a plate with coleslaw to top up with kimchi. Such attitude leave a bad taste in the good foo

Feel the homely cooking style of the Koreans. Great service too. Lady owner is also serving and helping to serve the BBQ meat. Your body and hair will not smell of the BBQ after you leave the restaurant.Place is small but cozy. Serves great ginseng chicken soup in a pot, side dishes were good. Love the kimchi and the beancurd soup too

Went to the restaurant with few best friends. Apart from the tough bbq beef (don't think I will be calling for that dish again), the ginseng chicken is the best Korean dish I have tried in Singapore thus far. The taste was authentic and will be back again whenever I have the craving

People had positive comments about this Korean restaurant but I have never got to visit because there is usually a queue during meal time and I don't prefer to wait. I was told by a Korean friend that the owner is Korean. So this time, it was off peak ie late lunch and we were promptly seated and food was served quickly. They served about 7 small dishes of starters and I liked everyone of them because they tasted very fresh. I was disappointed they didn't have the anchovies for starters. For mains, we had ginseng chicken soup and Korean non spicy pancake. Not bad. Next time, I will try the spicy dishes

Hansik is now serving unlimited BBQ at only $16++ for lunch and $22++ during dinner.And i think this is really a cheap deal worth going for because the quality of food is good which is sooo important.Love their well marinated pork belly and beef.and SUPER IN LOVE with their Korean Kimchi Pancake which is so crispy and very very tasty.Please see my blog for full reviews:http://ilovedawn00.blogspot.sg/2014/12/food-review-hansik-korean-family.ht
