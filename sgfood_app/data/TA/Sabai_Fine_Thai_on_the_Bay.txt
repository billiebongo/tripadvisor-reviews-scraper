Standard menu, fast and great ingredients with a fair amount of spice. Service reasonable but not overly attentive, they have enough foot traffic and business executives not to care. A good choice
4
Nice spot in marina bay.
Inside and outside tables
Thai food was very good, esp the Pomelo Salad, wonderfully done
Good wine list reasonably priced
Service pretty good
Will will go back
4
Good Thai, with seating available outside by the bay. Expensive, with beers the most expensive we found in Singapore. Was very quiet when we were there and so there was little atmosphere. Would try and find a more reasonably priced Thai restaurant next time.
5
I had lunch at Sabai Thai in October with two family members and had a very enjoyable and satisfying meal. Would recommend the pomelo salad, stuffed chicken wings, fried prawn cakes and tomyam seafood soup.
4
Good overall Thai food. We had a private seating area on the upper level which was private. I had the vegetarian options and the portions and the preparations were excellent.
5
I've been coming here for years, and have never had a bad meal. It's equally good for dining with friends, family and clients. The staff have been here for a while, and they remember return customers. Service is prompt, and I can bring an important client there with the assurance that we can sit down, order and focus on our business discussion without worrying about slow service or bad quality food.It's also one of a few restaurants in the Central Business District with a decent selection in their menu for vegetarians. In many other restaurants, you know what the vegetarian diner will eat even before you arrive - as there is only one vegetarian starter and one vegetarian entree on the menu.Finally, even though it is a fine dining restaurant, I have never felt pressured to spend. I can get a Pad Thai and a beer there, dine alone, and still leave with the feeling that I've had a great meal and great service

Went to Sarbai for NYE. While the food wasn’t too bad, the service was annoying. We had a 6 course set menu and were constantly being rushed for the next course, even though we were there for NYE and the fireworks at mid-night. We had a table next to the waiters station and I think we shared half the night with the waiters, who it felt were at the table with us - it was really close. Toilets were outside and I got wet each time I had to go due to the rain. In the end, we had a nice night in spite of this but I wouldn’t be in a hurry to go back - definitely not fine dining.
3
The atmosphere is amazing and the service was excellent during our visit. Menu selection is ok but be prepared to pay higher. It's very pricey and the taste is ok. Not too bad but maybe not worth the price. the steamed fish with lime is good. It was a good first experience but I may not come back again
3
The food was good but slow service at this restaurant. Quite cramped between the tables. Seemed quite popular, but unfortunately you were quickly forgotten, kind of overlooked, if you apparently were not a big spender. No toilet inside,but around the corner where they shared toilets with many others! Although we was not happy with this restaurant it was a nice area to spend the evening
4
We went to Dinner at Sabai Fine Thai, and very much enjoyed the food. The flavour was great and the way the dishes were presented was very appealing. We frequently eat Thai food, and this is for sure one of my favourite places. For any europeans, please be careful, the dishes can by quite spicy. If you however ask the waiters to not make it too spicy it shouldn't be a problem. What was amazing, was the view that came with the food. We sat outside and therefore were able to see the entire Singapore skyline at night. I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere especially with this beautiful backdrop. The one critique point would be the waiters. The staff was forthcoming when asking for special requests, however they did however seem very busy and not quite as attentive as in other places. We also had to wait for two of our entries, which meant that the rest of the table had to eat even though not everyone had their food yet
4
Had taken out some colleagues who were visiting us to this place. Nice food with a quite a few options available for vegetarians.
Good place for formal lunch / dinner near the bay
4
Loved Sabai! The location, food, service everything was perfect! They have an extensive menu for Vegetarians with some great Tofu dishes. Cant wait for my next trip to Singapore for a meal there
4
This is my favourite Thai restaurant. The location is great. I usually like to sit outside to enjoy the view.
Food are very tasty! service is good too. A must visit for me every time when I am in Singapore
highly recommended
5
Fine Thai is keeping the promise in its name. Delicious food, welcoming host and professional service. The few is great with Marina Bay opposite. Outside dining possible and very cozy and relaxing.
5
They have an extensive menu for vegetarians with the most delicious pomelo salad, corn cakes and mango sticky rice. Lovely location with an amazing view when you step out. Service is attentive too.
2
The restaurant is well located near Fullerton on the bay.We did not enjoy the food, nor the service. They are very expenive and food was below average.Very disappointing indeed and by far too expensive for what you get.The same for the quality of the food - it was just not good and we eat a lot of Thai and Asian.We can not recommend it
5
Visited for dinner. Just a minute walk from the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Tables were covered with white cloth, dishes tasted so good, beautiful Marina view from the outside tables, staffs were all good. Nothing to complain. S$150.00 for 2.This restaurant is supposed to be closed for 2 weeks (till end-Sept) for renovation
4
Had dinner at Sabai and since I am a vegetarian I was quite particular about the food I eat. Sabai is highly recommended if you are a vegetarian since they have a a lot of vegetarian dishes. I asked for a seating on the outside by the water and with lovely weather, it was a very good experience. Food was very good and the quantity of dishes was more than enough for 2 people to share. Waiters were very helpful and took very attentive care during dinner. Overall, a very good spot to eat if you are looking for a nice quiet dinner. Good value for mone
4
Was there with my ex- boss for dinner as we haven't been catching up for a good 2 years!! He plan the venue and indeed it was a nice ambience with a very good location ,nice sea view. We were seated indoors and service was warmth and genuine.Entrees and mains are of good portion and a good blend as well.We were serve by a gentleman (unsure of his name)But he looks A little from Laos or Nepal.Great service from him and he is very attentive as well and anticipating.Will recommends this place to my friends as the ambience is very welcoming.Thank you very much.
5
Had some good Thai food at this place. We were a large group and we got seating on the 1st floor - almost seemed like a private dining area. I liked their red, greed curries as well as the raw papaya salad. The ambience of the restaurant was also quite good
5
We ate dinner here. The location is lovely, by the bay. They served us awesome vegetarian food. The service was great. Very personal. The pineapple rice and olive rice stood out. Although every thing that we ordered was delectable. Must go!
5
The food, service and location we all fantastic. Sabai has great starters and the main coarse are excellent also. After a long day of sight seeing this hit the spot perfectly.
4
Went there to celebrate my sons birthday and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service was above average and the ambience was good. Highly recommended for good quality and genuine Thai food.
4
We booked a table on recommendation of our Hotel (Fullerton Bay ) and although they said they could only seat us outside or upstairs when we got there we had a table downstairs by the window which was very acceptable The staff were very attentive and helpful - when my husband ordered Jungle Curry the waiter explained that this was very spicy and might be too hot for European taste so we opted for the Panang red curry and Chicken & Mushroom with Oyster sauce with a prawn fried rice All very tasty. Yes you can eat Thai cheaper in many places in Singapore but this is a prime spot on the waterfront and a short walk from our hotel so we thought it was ideal for us and the light show still taking place when we finished was good too.
4
Went without reservation. Usually quite busy. Got a table outside. The service staff is quite courteous. Ordered prawn green curry, Kai lan, pomelo salad and rice. The food was served quickly. The food was good and the quantity was appropriate. The pricing was slightly expensive, duly so, as it's right at the marina Bay Area having the best views. Had an enjoyable evening.Didn't know it was a smoking zone. Had a bit of difficulty as people were smoking around us and we were passive inhalers
3
The food was solid (not amazing) and the service was inconsistent as we had to ask many times for some things. We sat on the upper-floor which was quite ugly, but the lower floor seemed to be nicer. I would not recommend this restaurant as overall the experience was average
4
The atmosphere was busy and classy. Thai food here is really good, on authenticity, I am not sure about but it was pretty impressive on taste. We have spring rolls to nibble on and the Thai noodle salad as starters, for mains the fried battered garoupa , kailan and Thai Green Curry Chicken served with white rice. The kitchen worked really fast, and being really hungry as we were that night, we were served pretty efficiently. The food tasted fresh and the portions were generous. I had a glass of crispy white wine from New Zealand which was a perfect combination with the spiciness of the thai herbs and spice I thought
5
Excellent food presentation and I enjoyed every single taste of the food. Five stars for the Chef and I must say the food is wonderful. Corn cakes was excellent and curry prepared I must say is authentic and different from all the other Thai restaurant that I visited. Their rice cracker called Khao Ta na tang is an excellent starter. Service staff very friendly
2
After reading some great reviews on Sabai Thai, we decided to head out there for a celebratory lunch. The first thing that hit us was the noise - it's in the CBD so huge lunch crowds are to be expected, but it was far too noisy for a fine dining establishment.The good thing was that they have an exhaustive vegetarian menu and the service is top notch too. The food, however, was disappointing. We had the Pomelo Salad, Red Curry, Cashew Tofu, and Pineapple Rice, plus a Lemongrass Mocktail and Thai Iced Milk Tea. The unique spicy Thai flavours you'd expect were completely missing and the food was fairly flat. Wouldn't go back unless there's a huge lift in the food and the ambiance
5
Visited Sabai Fine Thai on the Bay to celebrate friend's birthday. Joe See has very good product knowledge and knows what to recommend to customers. He was also very patient and attentive. When one of us spilled the soup over the table, he attended to us immediately and addressed the problem straight away by helping us to clean the mess up. Excellent service and the food was a bonus!
5
So far the best Thai food in Singapore since moving here 6 weeks ago. And my wife is Thai so it should mean something...... :-). Prices for food are reasonable for this quality but wines is obviously on Singapore level :-(.
5
After tasting the first plate I was back in Bangkok very impressive I recommend this place even at 9.00 pm they have accepted us for dinner very unusual in Singapore nice place nice people and the price attractive
5
Had a great meal here with some very flavoursome food. Authentic Thai food.
The service was also great.
5
We Chanced Upon this Restaurant While In Singapore 2 weeks ago.
The Food was Amazing although a Bit On the Expensive side being vegetarians and No
Alcohol but Was Definitely Worth It.
5
Plus: great food, best than cuisine, good location & ambience
Minus: slightly cramped, small portions
Overall: Happy
5
Great location, very attentive staff and excellent food. Easy walk from our hotel at the Ritz Carlton & well worth the visit. Thai a bit hotter than we are used to in the UK but rose to the challenge (they will happily adjust heat to your taste). Would come back next time in Singapore
4
We had eaten at Sabai Fine Thai recently. The food was to die for especially the fresh coconut water and the cream - took us right back to Thailand. The food was very authentic flavores and portions being very decently sized. overall, the food was a little expensive, but it was justified to for the authentic taste and the big party that we were (total 10 of us). Also, the restaurant had ample vegetarian options. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting to eat authentic thai food in Singapore
5
Had dinner here with my family last week and I must say that this is the best Thai food I've had in Singapore. Fresh ingredients and wonderful seasoning. Tom Yum Goong here was the clear but lethal kind, exactly the way I like it (without the heavy taste of nam prik pow). Seriously everything was so delicious. Don't let the waiter deceive you into thinking you've under-ordered- Thai food is meant to be eaten with lots of (free flow) rice, so you only need a few dishes to share. Also be sure to specify exactly how spicy you want your food or you could be crying through a few of the dishes like I did. This place seemed to cater mainly to foreigners (read: quite pricey), fresh coconuts cost $10++ each but the one I had was really sweet and tasty. Service was pretty good. Not much of a view from inside the restaurant, but hopefully the weather is cool and you can have a lovely after-dinner walk around the area.
5
i have been to this restaurant a few times over a number of years. Rare to find they serve authentic thai food that hasn't been "toned' down for the locals. service and food match. staff are very professional and do everything to cater to specific needs. cocktails and beers are of a very high standard. ambiance is understated and very welcoming. Anyone looking for good quality food - this place delivers with service and ambiance to matc
5
As good or better than any high end restaurant in Bangkok. The green papaya salad and the pomelo salad with shrimp were perfect starters. Green Curry, Grilled meats (beef and chicken, Pla Neung Manao, Som Tum, Yam Som Oo excellent and authentic. To finish it off mango and sticky rice and sliced durian. Singha Drafts and glasses of an excellent chard. A must in Singapore but it is small so reservations are essentia
4
I love this restaurant. Especially their vegetarian mushroom soup. Apart from that they have a big range of other vegetarian dishes.
I actually visit this restaurant every opportunity I get. Love the food. The location and the ambience.
Excellent food. Highly recommend.
5
Excellent Thai restaurant conveniently located at the Quay.
All the food was excellent, well cooked and very tasty, specially the red curry.
4
This restaurant is located in the customs house.Location is amazing.Seating available both indoors and outdoors.Please make a reservation before you go.Place is crowded.Food is amazing.Service is a tad slow.Good vegetarian options.Try the pomelo salad.Restaurant is worth a vist.Would cost SGD 150 for 3
5
My fiancÃ© and I were looking for a place to eat along the bay and stumbled upon this restaurant on Collier Quay. The manager took care of us personally and was extremely friendly as were all the staff. The food was just so delicious. Obviously fresh and we were checked on by the staff to make sure we were happy with the flavours and the spice which we were! It is a shame that we are not local to Singapore otherwise this would easily become one of our places to go. Thank yo
5
Love this place so much !!!! The food was tasty, properly prepared and a great value for the price. I like the pamelo salad, mouth watering ... keep appear in mind even back to hometown ...Good view, confortable environment and atmosphere ...Exellent services and friendly staff ... This is a place that we will highly recommend it... Surely will revisit whenever i travel to singapore !!

@TheKuoKnowsSabai Thai has done itself proud. It has turned humble Thai street food into exquisite Thai fine dining, without losing too much of the definition, which is not easy.Thai food is characterised by its strong kick of spices and herbs. Sabai has managed to round off some of the harshness but still retain the authenticity.There is enough flavour in the individual dishes without overpowering the dinner. Some might say it is too bland. I think it is just right.The set menu is not cheap, though. At $31 for a two-course lunch, it is almost as expensive as a meal that would feed four in some cheaper Thai cafes in Singapore.But all is forgiven after a mouthful of the Mango Salad. It is delicious. So too is the Mince Beef with Basil. Two courses with a generous heping of rice is more than enough to sate an afternoon craving for a touch of Thailand.The view from Customs House is pretty spectacular too. It is little wonder the restaurant is packed to the rafters at noon. So booking is advisable
3
We ate here on our first night and had some lovely food as described on recommendation. It was slightly on the pricey side, but this is what you get for such an excellent location. Once our drinks order was taken, we were pressured into making a quick decision for our starters and mains. I accept that staff want to get home, but why accept us in the first place? Don't get me wrong, the staff were very polite but a few problems arose with communication- maybe to be expected in a foreign country. I expect this is a 4* or 5* restaurant usually...
5
~dropped in without a lunch reservation for 5pax, was seated outside with a friendly smile and attentively served with multiple check walk pasts (a smiling hover by) to see if we needed anything else (we did too)~with a business meal always order the Tawd Mun (Fish or Prawn cakes) it's arrives fast and goes down less with the Yum Som Oo (Pomelo Salad)easy YUMz~Kao Pat Neua Kem fried rice with seasoned beef topped with fried egg is a delicious treat & scores a DOUBLE YUMzeasily the best drop in Thai restaurant that has out lasted everyone else at the Customs House, be forewarned lunch reservations are always very tough to get but if you arrive at 1130am and ask for the very hot but umbrella-ed outdoor seating you may get a chance to savor just why it's still so good

This evening we were a family of 5 and wanted to have a nice Thai meal for our last night in Singapore. Instead it turned out to be a complete disaster and after repeating several times we did not want the Papaya salad and red curry to be strong but very light it arrived so hot and spicy that we could not eat it. Not much Thai about this restaurant starting with the owner! Very angry that one can manipulate clients in this way instead of informing that the meals have already been pre-cocked. Small restaurant with a fairly large choice on the menu, does that justify such behavior? Not in my book!
1
As a foreigner staying in Singapore for only a few days, I was looking forward to a delicious Thai dinner which is, probably, one of my all time favorite cuisines in the culinary world. I will cut it short, the food which me and my family ate was almost unedible because of how spicy it was (eventhough we had asked after our appetizer not to add anymore spices on our following dishes). I regularly eat green and red curries all around the world and have never tasted such a spicy and tasteless curry in my life. The waiters were available only when we needed other drinks but never came to take away our appetizers!In addition, a waiter kept staring at me while I was looking at the bill which made me uncomfortable and unwanted.Terrible dinner!Don't recommend this restaurant to anybody in the area
5
Delicious food from the banquet menu and a great cocktail menu. Really loved the venue and the service was pretty fantastic too. The duck red curry was delicious as was the grapefruit salad and everything had a really great spiciness to it.
4
Good place to have the authentic thai food along with cocunut water by the sea.
Food was well cooked and staff was very courteous .
4
This is a small Restaurant on the Bay at the Customs House. It has both inside and outside dining and a very extensive traditional Thai menu. Service and food was very good. Like most Restaurants in Singapore wine can be expensive, theirs was no exception
3
Went there with my colleguage over my recent trip to Singapore. We order the dishes from the set lunch menu. The food was OK but too salty for me and I had to keep drinking the coconut juice. The service was alright. Overall quite an average restaurant although the location was quite good on the bay
4
Atmosphere is good. Both in and outdoor. If you can take the heat outdoor though.Am not a Thai food enthusiast but the food have worked to amaze me. Beverage selections are plenty. Red wine itself is enough to make me happy.Good view sitting outdoor, marina bay sands right across the quay, yachts parked by the bay. Suitable for quite dinner at the same time can also handle huge crowd for a Friday night drin

I was in Singapore for two days and a night for a very quick business trip, but was able to eke out enough time to meet a very good friend for lunch. He works close to the Marina, so suggested Sabai Fine Thai. So the restaurant is around the business district so highly frequented by office goers, and as such, fills up very quickly on a working day lunch time. I am assuming this means there are a lot of regulars who know what they want, and service is quick. Well, we took our time, didn't order alcohol, and ordered a few dishes. We ordered a chicken dish, a lamb dish and salad, all of which were excellent, and good sized portions! I had to go to the airport immediately after, so I do appreciate the staff's efforts in finding a spot in the packed restaurant for placing my luggage. The restaurant itself isn't big, so packs up quite fast. While the quality of food was very good, I was somehow put off by some of the staff. It seems they were focusing more on the larger, corporate groups, and we had to ask for service a few times.There was this server lady who was very nice, but the Maitre 'D seemed to ignore us mostly. All in all, very good Thai food
4
If you look for a nice ending of your day in Singapore, go to the bay and dine at the Sabai. If it is not too hot, go for a table outside (at the back side not at the front of the restaurant, the back side is quitter and the view is in my opinion better â€“ you have a good view on the skyline of downtown Singapore).The green curry was real good, try the Dtom Kha Gai, delicious!We went for another site for the dessert as the card was not that exiting (for western gusto)
2
As a vegetarian, the fish sauce smell was too overwhelming to sit indoors, so we opted for a table by the water outside. Ordering curries which they said were vegetarian, I am 100% certain were not and contained fish sauce. Seems the miscommunication between waiting staff and the kitchen cannot be avoided, and so we will not be returning. A real shame, as finding a good Thai place with veggie options in Singapore is not easy
4
Booked by our hotel, we secured a table by the window overlooking Collyers Quay. The menu contains the familiar staples, some more exotic choices (by English standards) and we were fortunate to enjoy a special, festival, regional menu from which we chose. Satay was succulent, main courses lived up to expectation and the wine as reasonably priced. Service was personal and we were surrounded by Thai diners. We would go back
3
We ate outside and it's definitely a neighbourhood where many people go after work for drinks. You sit nearby the Marina Bay and there's always stuff going on there. So good location. Food is OK, not spectacular but still fine. There were some misunderstandings with the order but that can always happen I guess. Staff were very friendly and so I could recommend this, but it's really a place I could recommend to a tourist given the location and price/quality, if you want real authentic Thai food there's also other options available in Singapore.
5
There aren't very many places in Singapore where you can get great quality Thai food and enjoy a comfortable, classy atmosphere. Sabai delivers in spades and the service is impeccable. Our out of town guests were very impressed and we will certainly be going back.
3
We went for New Year's Eve but we felt a bit rushed and also like cash cows. Food was ok but not great. What a great location for watching fireworks in first row!
4
I would say - best Thai food in Singapore!! This is a fine fine restaurant and they serve really good quality Thai food. The service is good - thanks to Joe ! He looks after us every time. Please inform the restaurant on the spice levels. The mango salad, red curry, steamed fish in coriander sauce ... Excellent !!
4
A Thai Restaurant close to Marina Bay Sand which offers a broad band of dishes, cooked to perfection. However, it is a little bit expensive, maybe you have to pay for the view. The staff is very friendly and helps you to make the right choice. The restaurant can be recommended for sure
5
Sabai , is a place where my husband and I go when we need comfort food. The food here is a modern take on Thai food. Being vegetarians , the choices in Thai food is usually limited for us but the staff here recommend and customise our food such that we don't have to put up with fish stalk etc. The tofu basil stir fry is an absolute must have. They have a good selection of wines as well. Location is fantastic and offers both alfresco and inside dining. Fridays and Saturdays are usually packed and would recommend making reservations.
5
Met a business associate for dinner. We had a couple cocktails form the menu which were quite good. I am vegetarian and am pleased to note there is wide selection of options from their separate veg menu. We had spring rolls and corn cakes. The corn cakes were amazing and worth going back for by themselves. We had Pat Thai, veg and non-veg, which were equally delicious. We of course topped it all off with mango sticky rice which was good.The location is great if you are out and want to walk around Marina Bay before or after your meal. It has an it side bar area that and inside air conditioned space. The restaurant is clean and well organized, as you would expect for the price point. The staff was attentive, though a bit slow as the restaurant filled. If you aren't already parked at the Mariana Bay somewhere, suggest a cab. Your closest and most convenient drop off is the Fullerton Bay Hotel on Marina Bay (not the Fullerton which is on the opposite side of the road). The Fullerton Bay is also the nearest taxi pick up.Overall, this is a great restaurant and goes on my personal favorites list in the number 2 position. I'll definitely be back next time I crave an outstanding Thai meal.
5
We went there midweek after Chinese New Year and it was busy but we were fortunate to get a table outside with an awesome bay view. Service was outstanding as we were immediately offered water and guided on our wine choice. We ordered the Pomelo Salad and Satay as appetizers. The main courses were green chicken curry and steamed sea bass with lime and chilli. Thankfully we had asked for all the food to be less spicy as it was still with plenty of chilli. The flavors were fantastic though. The only thing we might do different next time is substitute the Satay as though it was good you maybe better off at a hawker for the char broiled taste. Would agree with the others that this is the best Thai option in Singapore
5
We dined at Sabai at the recommendation of our concierge. It was delightful. A small restaurant that was nicely appointed, yet comfortable. The service was attentive and knowledgeable. We enjoyed the green papaya salad and deep fried chicken wings to start. The wings were deboned making them very easy to enjoy. They were stuffed and served with a spicy sauce as well as a sweet chili sauce. The papayas alas was ordered medium and the spice level was perfect for us. It was fresh and tasty. Both starters were presented with beautifully carved, edible garnishes. For our entrees we had pad Thai and a red curry with chicken. Again, we ordered medium spicy and it was perfect. The curry was silky smooth and I believe I could have enjoyed just the curry sauce and been happy- it was that good. The pad Thai was also delicious. My only regret is that I was not in Singapore long enough to dine here again.
4
Without a doubt the best fine dining Thai food in Singapore!Went with friends (dinner) and then again with my wife (lunch). Both times the food and drink was amazing.Tip 1: If you happen to go for lunch, they have a good set menu.Tip 2: I found their portion sizes to be generous. Enough for 2-people. For lunch, we got away with not choosing the set menu and sharing a main meal and we just got more rice to be smothered in their delicious curry sauce!Yummy, looking forward to going again with the wife
5
We went as a group and had the opportunity to try several dishes which were all good. The basil minced pork was perfectly cooked and moist. Definitely the best I've tried so far. Lychee Duck curry tasted delicate and spicy at the same time. My favourite of the night was the pomelo salad with dried spicy shrimps. Every bite was delightful! The Thai iced tea was costly though at $9++. Suggest to skip this and go for their signature cocktails
4
Really enjoyed the food here, and it's probably the nicest Thai food I've had in Singapore, but it's really expensive. Worth a nice treat once in a while.
5
Definitely a nice place to be with friends and family. The best Thai food i've ever tasted.. Loves the view and the concept and everything there.. To those Thai food lover you should give it a try.
5
3 of us came here for dinner. Food was excellent and authentically prepared. Fish cakes were well done. The curries were also spicy and thick.
Portions were also decent size which was great.
Would recommend coming here for meetings or a special occasion!
5
I visited this place last night. It's a really nice place to visit. They served soup, appitizer, noodles, rice, meat, dessert of traditional Thai food. It was really the best Thai food i've ever had ! Most of all, i was impressed that they served good service
4
I've frequented this place several times as it is great for business lunches and for friendly dinners by the river. Food is great and service is just about right. Their raw mango salad, usual thai curries are great. Their drinks selection could do with some improvement but even so nothing to worry about
4
I visited this place as a part of a brunch meeting. Very courteous staff, the ambiance was great - not loud nor silent. the view is beautiful and especially in the afternoon times when the heat is killing you.the dishes are of different variety and sometimes i feel they lack the authentic thai flavor. but i guess being in singapore, they need to cater to every taste in the city.all in all, worth a visit and putting them in my top restaurant list hereon
2
The only thing nice about this is the location. We went for a friends birthday and they kept serving water and never mentioned it was still from the bottle so my friend paid a lot . food is not super authentic so u pay for ambiance.
5
Wide selection of Thai dishes - quality verified by my Thai friends :)Nice atmosphere for outside dining. Helpful and friendly staff.Recommend it mainly for meetings with friends or for a couple dinner - make sure you call in advance to book your perfect table for the occasion

Not. Very. Good. about sums up our visit to Sabai, a Thai fine dining restaurant near Raffles Place (in Custom House). We had fairly high expectations having had good a la carte fare there in the past. Tables were quite close to each other and the place was bustling and busy, but acoustics were good enough for comfortable conversation. Two of us were there for a weekday lunch and chose 2-course lunch sets. The starters were yam so moo (pomelo salad with prawn) and dtom yam gai (chicken tom yam soup); mains were pat gaprao talay (spicy stir fried seafood with peppercorn & basil) and kao pat gung (fried rice with prawn and egg). The starters were good. The salad was mild but well balanced – the prawn and dressing (which we couldn’t identify) balancing the pomelo well. The soup was excellent, spicy but fragrant, the flavours of galangal and lemongrass distinct but not overpowering. The mains, though, were scarcely in the same class. The fried rice was saltier than it should have been and the prawns in it weren’t the best. The stir fried seafood was quite a small portion, and was neither particularly spicy nor very memorably flavoured. The seafood in it was quite average and the basil and green peppercorn didn’t really give it the kick we expected. It didn’t help that we were charged fifty cents each for tap water on top of the $31 price of the set. And the service was competent without being welcoming. If you must go, we would suggest ordering off the menu (at least the food is better) and avoiding the table d’hote lunch. Perhaps ok for a business lunch where food is not the focus but not for a date.We would have rated this meal "Average" at a less smart restaurant, but at a fine dining restaurant it's definitely "Poor"

Food was good, and authentic. Great location next to the Fullerton Bay hotel with nice view. They also have private rooms on the second floor for business meetings and family gathering.
4
A very nice Thai restaurant, with personalised and efficient service. Across the bay from Marina Bay Sands. Nice view and good food.

i tried this sabai thai in customs house 2 times. Thai food so authentic and good collection of wines and beers.staff is warm and offered great service. food will arrive 20 mins. good place to chill and great food and spend a evening. i loved it .. must tr
5
One thing that you MUST try is their out of this world PANDAN CHICKEN ( which is not always available due to its popularity ). Every ingredient used to prepare its dishes are personally scrutinised and hand picked by the owner herself Miss Nu. Even the mangoes are flow directly from Thailand otherwise no mango dishes will be served. Yes its pricey buy hey you pay for what you get - Its fine dining mine you

We visited the restaurant today for dinner. The food was fine but service levels leave a lot to be desired. The waiter serving rice was behaving as if he was parting with a precious commodity... The service was slow and when mentioned , we got a shrug of the shoulder in response. And btw, this place charges for tap water. Food is ok but frankly there are a lot of similar restaurants with good food, ambience and better service ethics.. And free water.

I researched this restaurant prior to visiting Singapore & we were not disappointed.We both had a starter and a main all amazing presentation & flavors topped off with friendly service which advised us perfectly. The highlight main dish was chili crusted grouper. My wife & I are complete foodies & a month on we are still talking about this dish. I recommend booking at least a day in advance for dinner to avoid disappointment. Fantastic meal thank you very much we will visit again on our next visit to Singapore
4
This is a great place near the Marina Bay Financial Centre, we ate upstairs which whilst modest in size is a great place to have discussions over lunch.The service is discrete, and the food good. There are two and three corse set lunches and these are very easy to order and a joy to eatAll in all very goo
4
Business lunches are never easy but the service at Sabai was exceptional, no fuss on the orders all the food came at the same time. The service was excellent but invisible just what you want when out for a business lunch and discussing various matters with no interruptions.. Well done and I will be back for more. Thank you

I had dinner here with my wife. The restaurant looks very nice and modern. It's located at the bay. There are some tables outside that have a nice view, but most of the tables inside the restaurant do not offer any special view on the bay. The service was reserved, but not necessarily in a positive way. We found it a bit indifferent, and the staff was not very motivated. What we disliked the most was the food. The food here was not well prepared. It lacked a number of spices, and was rather bland. My wife and I cook and eat regularly Thai/Indian food, and this was a disappointing meal, definitely nothing for foodies. We regretted eating here, also because of the relatively high cost to value ratio. We will definitely not go back here
4
We enjoyed our National Day dinner at Sabai. It was an impromptu decision to watch the fireworks display. Luckily we managed to reserve a table at Sabai. Joe was very patient in handling my enquiries. The food was served within a short while. The omelette was very fluffy and crispy. The succulent chicken satay were above our expectation. We had a wonderful view of the fireworks after dinner. Good food, good view and bonding time wih family made this day a memorable dining experience
4
The overall ambiance, view and the flickering candlelight on the table made the night an exceptionally enjoyable one. Service was good too, staff was very friendly. Great food, authentic.
5
Unpretentious and very sweet service, generous helpings, good value. Originally went there with friends some time ago. We'll be back. I don't know about later in the evening, but it was beautifully quiet early in the evening.
5
An excellent venue for a business lunch as it's upmarket, close to CBD and has great food. Dinners are even better with outdoor seating possible (by the waterside). Chef's suggestions are very good as they have some unique dishes..
4
Did the 3 course set lunch for two pax that came to about S$80 all in. Food was decent and tasty but understandably pricy given the location by the water and in the business district
4
I loved everything. Been there many times.
My favorite were the olive rice, the grilled Bengal prawns and the salads.
5
Visited with my wife and her parents. Of all the places we tried during our trip, this was the best. Nice setting, very good food, attentive service. Tried several vegetarian items (they have a separate vegetarian menu) and all were good. We ordered the Tom Yum soup and a curry, both mild, but both were still quite spicy. Be careful.
5
We ate dinner at Sabai Thai. Ask to be seated outside, the side facing the Marina bay. It is gorgeous at night. The food was delicious. They had a separate section on the menu for vegatarian. The service was friendly and prompt. Singapore is expensive so should not be saying much on the price, but this place was quite expensive.
3
In a good location near the business district and with a waterfront view, this place has a nice ambience and is good for hosting visitors who want a break from the local cuisine. Food is so-so and in small portions for the prices charged but they have a bar and service was excellent
5
i have been going to this restaurant for over 15 years never seen just good quality of food and service maintained for such a long time. tom yum soup is outstanding. i have visited over 100 times this restaurant but the service is outstanding. please book and go. sat only dinner and sunday it is close
4
I stopped by for a dinner the other day. Food is good, there is a nice view if you sit outside. Service is adequate overall. My main course was delayed, so I got a free dessert. The deep-fried catfish salad was ok. The duck curry was excellent, well worth waiting for. The dessert was pretty good as well. I didn't love $10 bottled water. The check came up to $70 or so, what with service charges and taxes. That's a bit high for what you get.All in all, works for a dinner with a view. I did find it funny that I could get better Thai food in, say, Montreal at a fraction of a price..
4
Located next to bay, views are excellent. Food is very good.Thai fusion. Highly recommended. Tends to be crowded.
4
It is one of the better restaurants in the city at Customs House.
I love the Olive Rice and the Pamelo salad. Bengal prawns. Service is adequate no complains. They have a good vegetarian selection. For a dinner fare for 2 S$120.00.
5
We had an excellent dinner here, seated outside in the breeze along the river, with excellent vegetarian fare. The wine selection is not expansive but the food range is great. The rice is real Thai rice and the food options are wide.
5
Authentic Thai Food - great location and - premium price Totally worth it !!!This is a fine fine Thai restaurant on the bay. The food is delicious.. I would recommends :Steamed fish in spicy sauceGreen curryOlive fried rice Red riceChicken with basilRice crackers with minced chicken
4
My niece had organized for my partner to celebrate at Sabai Fine Thai on the bay.The restaurant was a bit on the small side on the inside, I was unaware there was more tables outside.The service was very friendly and efficient, but to have to pay for tap water was a bit too much.The food was not as flavoursome as the thai dishes I was use to, and the dish my niece had was usually not too hot, but she found her dish very hard to eat, The wonderful staff did try all they could to help my niece.My niece had also tried to organize some sort of cake for my partners birthday, they did not have a cake so they gave us a plate of Tapioca with coconut cream with a candle in it, very unusual but kind of tasty with the coconut cream and very nice of them for trying
5
Sabai Thai at Customs House by the Bay gets our vote for the best place to entertain for it has the whole package of a beautiful restaurant nestled in the Fullerton Bay Area. Excellent authentic Thai food, cosy ambience & good service provide for a lovely experience altogether. We had the following - mango salad, rice crackers with minced chicken, stuffed chicken wings as starters. Red duck curry with lychee, fish cake, clay pot prawns, clear tom yam and mixed vegetable for the mains. Everything was just delicious! Unfortunately we were too puffed up to try the desserts. If you want something fool proof and safe, Sabai is the place
5
An evening catching up with friends who know I am a foodie; they brought me to Sabai and we had a range of dishes including green curry, fish with ginger and shallots, and the amazing tapioca in syrup with coconut cream. The service was great, the setting just perfect for people wanting to chat and catch up (not noisy at all), and the food tasted very fresh with great flavours. The dessert was the highlight for me. I highly recommend, and will return when I am next in Singapore
4
The reviews tempted us to try this fine dining place in the old Custom House in sinagpore waterfront. We did.themfood lived up to its expectations with good suggestions from the steward Shiva. The chillies are well camouflaged so do be careful.The red and green curries are both exquisite and the soups were delicious . They serve soup in a pot for easy sharing.The ambience however is less than what the photos suggest.its also much smaller than what the photos seem. The outside tables are on the pavement and not like the breezy outdoor seating at the places near the Fullerton

Chef Samlee is known for her skill and expertise in Thai Cuisine. After all for thirty years, she cooked for HRH Princess Srinagarindra while she travelled.In my mind I couldn’t quite grasp the concept of Thai and fine dining together. I love them both separately so surely I’d love them just as much together? Unfortunately I must say that we were both pretty disappointed with the meal that I received at Sabai as I love Thai food very much.Let’s start with the positives…The delicious Yam Mamuang (spicy green mango salad with prawns, chicken, roasted coconut, grounded peanuts and sweet sauce) is bursting with fresh flavours and exotic notes. The See-krong moo op nahmpeung (deep-fried smoked honey pork ribs) is unbelievably succulent.From really good to really bad. The Gang gwio warn gai (authentic green curry with chicken, coconut cream, sweet basil leaves, eggplant and pea eggplant) has a rich, heady flavour that comes with well-seasoned curries but the overall effect is disappointing due to the crappy “Plastic chicken”meat texture which is so rubbery and tasteless. The Pls kao sam rod, ratt prik, tawd gratiem (deep-fried garoupa fillet with three flavoured sauce, spicy and sour sauce or garlic and peppercorns) was so dry…so bad tasting.A Thai meal would not be complete without a bowl of Dtom yum gung, pla (spicy and sour prawns and fish soup with lemongrass, galangal, chilli, kaffir lime leaves, fish sauce and fresh lime juice). Beware though, this one is a tongue-numbing experience.Sabai is somewhat more expensive than many other Thai restaurants in Singapore, but judging by my recent visit, easily forgettable compared to most Thai food I’ve had.This is the true truth as I say it as it is…(www.perfyi.wordpress.com

Dear Trip Advisor Team,It is with great pleasure that I have the opportunity write a review for the Sabai Fine Thai on the Bay in Singapore. As part of my role in SAP SE (German multinational software corporation), upon request from my Manager (who leads a global team), I had the opportunity to organise a business dinner event at this restaurant from Ireland without any difficulty whatsoever through both phone and email communication.The management team were fantastic and accommodated our every requirement and understood our needs for attention to detail. The team delivered to the highest standard both in Service and Food. Our SAP team evening was a great success and a wonderful evening was had by all involved.It would be our pleasure to revisit this restaurant in the near future and we highly recommend it to all to experience it both for business or pleasure.THANK YOU JOE and TEAM @ Sabai Fine Thai!Regards Niamh MaloneSA
4
We had a great Thai food and service! I really recommend to go there with people not leaving on SG. The Marina is nice and there are few bars aorund as well. This place is quite expensive like all restaurants there.
4
Very pleasantly surprised by the service provided by Joe and his team. The food exceeded our expectations, though a couple of dishes were pretty spicy.
We will definitely be back for more!
5
We came at the recommendation of the Concierge at the Four a Seasons. We had a table outside...... waterside. Great food. I can see why it's recommended. It reminded me on eating at Woolloomooloo in Sydney.
5
food here is really amazing and one can sense the flavors even after 3-4hrs of having food here. Must try while in Singapore and quite popular among locals.
5
My partner and I had a party recently at Sabai Fine Thai where they have a nice little private dining room upstairs which caters up to approx.30 people. We had eaten in this restaurant before and were very impressed by the quality of the food and wine. When I was in the organising stages for our party, Joe was very helpful and catered to our every request and even gave advice on particular dishes. The location of this restaurant is in an excellent area of Singapore and I would advise prior booking as it is very popular. We will be back again and thanks to all the Sabai team for all their help
4
The restaurant was running a full house for lunch. Luckily, we made a reservation. I requested for a quiet area when making the reservation, so we were given a private room which was perfect for a lunch meeting.Service was great - attentive but not intrusive. Food - yummy with a good selection
5
The staff at Sabai Thai were extremely friendly and very knowledgable of their menu. They helped us out with our vegetarian selections and the food was divine! They even helped us find the best red wine to compliment our meal. The combination of delicious food and awesome service made our experience that much more memorable. Can't wait to go back for more!
4
By the bay only applies if you sit outside and during the day it's going to be hot. For a more better outdoor experience it's best to visit in the evening.Good food, wouldn't say there is a real speciality. Got to give it for their tapioca dessert and mango sticky rice. Rich and awesome.Worth dropping by for a dinner
4
It's probably one of the best Thai food in Singapore and not overly expensive (note that it's not hawker center price either). Recommended dish - red curry and chicken with basil leaves. The ever smiling servers is also a nice change from the usual service you may get in a number of restaurants in Singapore
4
A fairly standard Thai menu with favorites such as soft-shell crab, fish and prawns cakes, sates etc. So why come here? First the food is very well cooked, and the service is brisk and efficient but they are in no hurry to see you go. So we had a couple of beers before we ate sat outside on the boardwalk and a couple after dinner. The bill, including 9 bottles of beer was around S$230 for two which we taught represented good value. Eating inside is a bit smarter and cooler. Second vist, very good both time
4
After 2 weeks in Paris eating baguettes and macaroons a spicy fresh and interesting Thia meal hit the spot. It is very popular and busy but well worth giving it a try.
4
Very authentic thai food, best mango sallad we ever had, but all dishes was really tasty. A friendly observant staff took good care of us. Good location, with a nice view over the marina.
4
My third visit to this restaurant. Good solid Thai food and curries. A balanced and good menu (some with a twist) with a reasonable selection of wines. They should have a better selection of wines by the glass though. Service was very good and attentive. On Collyer Quay so one can have 2 different views (outdoors) depending on preference. Very enjoyable
4
Our first NYE in Singapore having moved here from the U.S. and we could not have been more pleased. Service was highly attentive and accommodating. They were very considerate of several food allergies and the substitutions were as delicious as the original menu. A variety of flavors and textures displayed beautifully made this an extraordinary meal. We would definitely return
4
We had a guest from England and wanted somewhere serving good Thai food in the centre of the city. This hit the mark. Service was attentive without being intrusive. The food was very good and beautifully presented as one would hope given the price range of the dishes. The waiter took care to check how hot we wanted the dishes prepared. Slightly odd to have to leave the restaurant and walk in the rain to the toilets
5
A beautifully appointed restaurant in a superb location - on the quay in the Custom House. I was seated immediately and served with drinks efficiently. The food came quickly and the service was efficient and friendly which contributed to a very convivial atmosphere. The prawn cakes and chicken pandanus was very good.
5
We come to this place often. My favorite dishes are stuffed chicken wings, rice crackers with minced chicken, green curry, mussamum curry, deep fried prawns and sweet and sour pork. Although a little pricey it's worth it! Service is quite good! Cocktails are tasty! Will definitely come back! Atmosphere is cozy and comfortable
5
Took my parents who were visiting Singapore, book ahead on weekends, especially if you want to sit inside. The restaurant has a wonderful setting by the bay with outdoor seating overlooking the CBD, the interiors are good, just like one would expect at a good fine dine restaurant. Not sure of this fact, but I believe that the chef from Thayning at Amara moved to Sabai a few years ago and since then the place has taken off. They have an extensive menu including loads of vegetarian options (they understand the concept of Indian vegetarian - no fish sauce in those dishes). We ordered a mango salad and a tom yam chicken pot to begin with, both were very good. For mains we proceeded to get a steamed seabass in chilly lime gravy (not spicy), minced chicken in basil leaf sauce (can be made spicy), a green curry and rice. They've mastered the proportions of lime to make their dishes tangy but not overbearingly sour. Each dish had multiple of flavours - something which I use as a yardstick to grade taste, for me one flavour can be good, but when you can taste multiple flavours in your mouth such as sweet and spicy or sour and spicy etc I quite enjoy those dishes. For desserts we got steamed tapioca with coconut cream - this was probably something I won't order again. The prices are quite steep here, especially for the drinks and the coconut water is probably off the charts, but if you fancy good Thai food on a special occasion or want to bring somebody out, do give Sabai a go. I believe that they have another branch at Takashimaya in Orchard, but check before heading there. The service is courteous and fast
4
This was a convenient food joint for lunch which I bring my colleagues and business associates for lunch. The Thai food is good, red curry was authentic and the tom yum very nice. The stuffed chicken wings are also good. Nice for a quick business lunch.
5
I frequently have good quality Thai food in Melbourne, and to be frank, I wasn't expecting much more when I arrived here. I was wrong. I visited on another balmy evening in SIN, and the alfresco dining setting was most enjoyable - coupled with the Marina Bay Sands and the various big buildings. I only went inside to pay but it looked very civilised in there as well. Environment? Check. There was a little mix-up at the start, where I was given the wrong cider, but that was resolved promptly and efficiently with no fuss at all. The various waiters coming in and out to serve were also very polite. So to was what appeared to be the manager, who was very willing to anecdotally discuss his experiences of travelling in my home country. Customer service? Check. The food is sublime, and very well presented. The chefs here really know Thai spices and this was very evident in their cooking. Food quality and presentation? Check. While this is not the cheapest meal one can have, in life, you DO get what you pay for, and this is a very appropriate application of that motto. Don't get me wrong, it's not audaciously expensive, but it's not Chinatown either. Value for money? Check. As you can see, this restaurant IS a "showstopper - in all areas". I highly recommend this to well, everyone
5
Great service as staff busy but always attentive, interesting and varied menu and we enjoyed excellent food, nice ambiance as the place had a good buzz about it.
3
We were ordered pad thai, chicken curry and fish pla lard prik. Pad thai and green curry quite good. Service is fast and attentive. Price is a bit expensive but you can enjoy good view in this restaurant.
4
....And its rare that one can say that for restaurants in Singapore! And it's a good veg menu too (not swimming with mock meat as they often are). Quite spicy.
5
Had a recommendation from a friend to try Sabai, or The Longtail Brassiere next door, the night we visited, The two restaurants were very busy, but some people had just vacated a table outside Sabai, so we decided to try it. The location is just perfect, overlooking the waterfront, which is a perfect position to view the laser light show. Would definitely have no hesitation recommending Sabai, and if we manage to return to Singapore, will be back again
4
Think the real attraction of Sabai Thai in addition to its reasonable quality of food is that its priced just right for the location and the ambience is pretty nice as well. Great food selection for vegetarian and non vegetarian - and I have hosted a vegan couple here as well - where with pre-communication of restrictions, they were able to cater to the restrictions as well which I found amazing. The outdoor seating on either side of the restaurant is great if the weather is conducive - and it makes for a very nice Saturday dinner location away from the crowds (they are closed on Sunday's last time I checked - and may not be that appealing for those who work in the area but I don't really mind that :p)
4
I am a big fan of Thai food and Sabai didn't disappoint!!!If you are a vegetarian (l am), then you must try their Thai green curry with olive rice. I didn't like dessert menu though. Seating outside is very pleasant as well with view of the bay.They serve excellent coconut water and you must have it instead of the usual drinks.Overall, a very good experience
3
Expensive thai place, not backed up service to match. Food was brought out piecemeal even though we requested for the main dishes to be brought together. Had to ask twice for drinks, and for the bill. Hate the fact that we have to pay 10% service for non-existent service offered.Much better Thai to be had at a better price around the city.
5
Consistently excellent food, and a reasonable priced business lunch. Firendly and attentive service, and owners that care.Interesting lemon grass and other cocktails & drinks. I am a regular and always enjoy my lunches there. Also a good place to meet with friends, eat outdoors and view the Marina Bay light show
4
I had lunch in this fine Thai restaurant, the food was very good and since it was a nice day, we chose a table outside with great views. Since it was a work day the restaurant was very busy, but calm descended after 1:30 pm. After a great lunch we took a stroll on the the riverside
4
Although I didn't get a chance to select from the extensive menu as I was part of a large party, I have no complaints about any of the dishes served.All very very enjoyable, good quality and tasty!Based at Customs House I was also lucky enough to see the light and laser show from my hotel, the Marina Bay Sands. Set off a great dinner!I have been to Sabai before and will be back
3
Good views when sitting outside, but overall the food was extremely spicy. staff was good and understanding. I feel that one could probably go elsewhere.
4
When you sit outside at Sabai Thai at Customs House and watch the light and laser show at Marina Bay Sands watching the world go bu enjoying their great food and wine the world is a happy place!With a vast menu to choose from and an extensive vegetarian one Sabai Thai hardly ever fails to deliver quality food. The wines on offer are also pretty good. Service is occasionally haphazard with food all coming at the same time even when you tell them starters first but that's just Singapore! You get around that by only ordering one course at a time.Sit outside and enjoy the views and the atmosphere and really enjoy a great place to go for dinner
4
Great food! The server went the extra mile to help me understand how the dishes were prepared. Even expained the different types of noodles and sauces. Great job! Food was a cut above the regular Thai restaurant experience. Much more care and attention to details in preparing the dishes
4
I have a very long experience of Thai food. Even though I am European I regularly cook and eat Thai food. Sabai is my favorite Thai restaurant in Singapore (so far). It has a great choice of food and an excellent service. I was very sad when they closed their second restaurant at Takashimaya but its I worth traveling to the old customs house on the bay to get a great Thai lunch or dinner. Reservations are essential.Service: 4 out of 5Food: 4.5 out of 5Décor: 4 out of 5Value for money: 4 out of 
3
We had a visiting colleague from overseas, so took them here for a more 'up-market' Thai.Interior has a nice décor & outdoor tables have a water view, though more side on than actually facing out over to MBS like some other shorefront restaurants.Overall, the food was very nice & service friendly - but I thought that paying $220 for 2 entrees & 2 mains, 4 Singha beers & a water was a bit pricey & I've had just as good at many more casual Thai places for much less, albeit minus the view
5
What a great restaurant. Innovative cocktails and classic thai dishes made to mouthwatering perfection with the freshest ingredients. The salads were fragrant and delicious, the duck-lichee curry was without doubt the best curry I have ever tasted, and the steamed sea bass was pure delight. A treat
3
Went to this restaurant based on the good reviews but was sadly disappointed. The restaurant is in a lovely location with great views over the bay. Service was efficient and friendly and the cocktails we ordered were nice. Real let down was the quality of the food. The fried honey chicken was overcooked and very chewy and the Pat Thai was served with a very bitter Tamarind sauce and was lacking flavour. Not sure if the food was not so good as they were quiet on a Monday night but on the basis of the food I would not recommend this restaurant
4
Very tasty food, with a few unusual dishes not often found at other Thai eateries. Some dishes (salad, curry) tend to be on the sweet side, but they will adjust sweetness and spiciness on demand. The menu is not as extensive or creative as at the Ngee Ann City branch, but it's long enough. Professional, friendly staff. The décor is a bit too bare for a restaurant of this class and price level. The set lunches offer decent value. Overall, I am sabai (happy) with Sabai
4
We recently had an opportunity to dine at this venue on a week day night. Reservations are a must. The place was booming yet we had terrific service all evening. Our waitress was fully capable of describing all the dishes on the menu and making recommendations so that we could enjoy the full Thai Food experience. Everything was served in a timely fashion and at the right temperature. We found an affordable bottle of wine that we enjoyed. It seemed to us they were hitting home runs with everyone in the restaurant. Located at the water front it opens up lots of places to walk to afterwards to enjoy the balance of the evening
5
Had a lovely evening in May at this restaurant as guest of Mr Robert Ng and Mr Ronald Arculli and their charming wives.Service was excellent and the food was the best Thai food I have eaten.Well worth a visit and easy to see why it is so popular
5
One of my favorite restaurants have been here over 100 times. One of the best Thai foods available in sing. Tom yum soup is a must. They have separate veg menu which is unique thing . Also unchan lemon drink is worth having.
4
Enjoyed the thai food which aws of excellent quality and service very good. Quick and helpful staff. The chicken satays and green curry were good and the peanut butter chicken delicious. Will definetely come back
4
I have been to Sabai Thai many times when I was living in Singapore. I have been there with friends and family. While I would not strictly classify this as fine dining, I would not call this casual dining either. It falls in between.The decor is good, but not outstanding. It has a touch of formality, without overdoing it, and this allows you to go there with your kids.The service is very good, as is their food. I absolutely loved their salads, especially the papaya and mango salads. The beef massam is excellent, as is their soup. All their soups are good. The flavours are good, without being too richThey have a great vegetarian selection, which was a boon for my wife. I liked their vegetarian food as well. So, I tended to overeat when I went there!A good place to eat good Thai food
5
The most oh-my-god Thai mango salad I've ever had.I have had Thai red curry at many restaurants, but this one is in a different league altogether. They also have a range of vegetarian options. So if you are vegetarian and are looking for something beyond tofu, this might be the place to go.My vegetarian friend was pretty excited. Yes, it is a little pricey, but then again its fine dining!Definitely a great place to go for celebrations
5
My boyfriend and I are fan of Thai food. We came here once by coincidentally and we love the place here. Second time here to celebrate my mum bday. The food and service was awesome. I love the mango salad and Tomyum gong was freshly prepared so you can choose the level of spiciness, green curry and Red curry was amazing. Another must try will be the stuffed chicken wing.For the dessert, I would strongly recommend tapioca and mango sticky rice. You can try their homemade coconut ice cream too
4
Love the fact that you have a choice of steamed white or brown rice. That apart the flavours are very good too,We had, the green curry, which was a tad on the spicy side but delicious; morning glory in yellow bean paste sauce which gave it a lovely mildly smokey flavour. The piece de resistance though has to be - the bitter gourd salad. We ordered it with some trepidation but the balance of flavours was absolutely heavenly, a tangy lime & chilli sauce perfectly setting off the mild bitterness of the gourd.And yes the service is pretty good too
4
I have been here several times, with guests.The food is always delicious and very close to authentic Thai food taste.They serve very delicious brown rice, as an alternative, with the main courses.The service is great, very attentive and flexible. Last night, when I was there, they took my order before my guest arrived and, when she did, they had the food on the table within 5 minutes.Location is great, close to the Customs House, near Collyer Quay
4
Good location. Food is consistently good - I have visited this restaurant on multiple occasions, though always for dinner. The tom yam seafood soup is excellent. So are the corn fritters (which I have not seen at any other Thai restaurant in Singapore).It has 3 pages of vegetarian dishes, which is a welcome change as against other Thai restaurants (or any other Asian restaurants) in Singapore. Most of the mains are tofu based though - one wishes there were more vegetable-based dishes.  I believe there are more cost-effective lunch options available, targeted at the office crowd during working days, since it is located next to the CBD.The service quality is average - the staff has a slightly indifferent. Thus one of their captains - Ivan - stands out by his excellent attitude and attentiveness. If you're going there for dinner, ask for him to assist you with your meal and service, and you would have a more pleasant experience than otherwise. The rest of the staff's attitude, unfortunately, is not worthy of a place like that. It has outdoor seating on two sides. Both settings are nice, but Singapore being Singapore, it can get quite warm. From both sides, one can catch a glimpse of the Marina Bay Sands laser show at the fixed timings. Parking needs to be done either at One Fullerton, or at the building called Sail (which is the closest, but across a busy street). Parking, and then walking from either takes time - so plan accordingly
4
Both locations are offer consistently beautiful thai food. Great lunch time menu and plenty to offer the seafood, beef & poultry & vegetarian lover.Imagine how surprised I was when I asked for a modified a vegetarian dish and the waitress said 'of course we can make variation'....this is not common in SIngapore! so I treasured the moment and the food even more.You can vary the spice, sugar and lime & fish flavour. Just ask.This is not for Singaporean pallet - to enjoy you must know thai food and be willing to pay (i guess to cover the rent!).Its a little pricey; of course its not processed rubblish like thai express but its also not top end thai - think mid range experience .Ngee An City branch needs a makeover - and could do well to offer you a wet towel - I thought they used to do this
5
Sabai has two locations -- Ngee Ann City / Takashimaya in Orchard Road, and near Customs House in Marina Bay near Raffles Place and Marina Bay Financial Centre. The one at Marina Bay has outside seating. These locations suit both the tourist and business person. We frequent both. Over the years we have tried many dishes and the best include the steamed cod (2 variants), green curry (chicken or vegetarian); tofu or chicken with fresh basil and green pepper; fried chicken in Pandan leaves; and fried prawns in an egg net.Foodies not accustomed to spicy foods can request a toning down of the chillies as some of the red or green babies can get really hot! Sabai's Thai spices are aromatic and not necessarily hot. So enjoy it.I like the "Red Ruby" for dessert (water chestnuts with coconut milk and crushed ice) -- a great "coolant" after spicy food
4
Tried the one in Ngee Ann City Orchard. The dark rice is nice. The pad thai a must. The grapefruit salad has interesting and flavorful salad.The sweet potato desserts aww..
5
Have eaten there numerous times, mostly for lunch and can say that it serves the best Thai food in Singapore. Food has not once been a disappointment and service is excellent.
Excellent green curry and their sweet&sour chicken with cashew is fantastic.

Did not know what to expect after just returning from Thailand and being lucky to get a table at last minute for new years eve. Set menu was great. They catered for full veg option and also dietary needs. They even spoke to chef on shopping items. Very accommodating. Excellent service over the phone. Welcomed on arrival. Tabled decorated. Party packs provided to entertain ourselves. Food was elegant and impressive. Not rushed. Service could have been better but I guess the extra hands did not want to work on new years eve. Views were good. Not sure what the normal menu is priced at. But I'm sure I'd go back again.

Went to the one on Level 4 in Ngee Ann City Orchard; The quality of the desserts are declining and the number of selections also have been reduced; whilst the price remains the same. The food is nothing fantastic. The environment is quite dark at times looks dirty. The service is horrible. It's as if the cook are waiting for everyone to arrive so that they can cook the same dish altogether. Avoid if possible; unless if you really have a taste for Thai and happens to be right in front of the restaurant

Definitely the best thai food I've ever had outside thailand. We tried different types of curry and all of them were superb. I suggest the peanut curry, an amazing explosion of taste in your mouth. Also the salads, like the mango or pomelo ones, are eccellent! Last but not least the view on the bay is great

Travelling to Singapore a lot on business, I get the chance to eat out regularly. I was introduced to Sabai by local friends and tend to return each trip, either entertaining a client or just enjoying a meal by myself.The place can fill up fast and booking is sensible, but I have found it easy to get a table if I arrive early or late. I have always found the service to be friendly and accommodating. Often restaurants struggle with solo diners, but at Sabai I have been offered magazines, and on one occasion as I was getting ready to leave the heavens opened and a fierce rainstorm hit. One of the staff came over and suggested I wait for the storm to pass and gave me green tea. A nice touch!I love the food. The Tom Yum is spicy and mouth filling, the salads hit the spot, but my personal favourite is the red curry duck. Reasonable serve of duck (many restaurants pack the dish out with duck skin), real spice and just a touch of sweetness with the addition of lychee. I have eaten quite widely from the menu with friends but always come back to the duck. The beer is cold, the wine list good, and despite what a couple of other reviewers have said, I have always found the Sevice great. This is on my list of Singapore favourites

The restaurant menu has a good selection and I love the fact there is a separate vegetarian menu. For starters we had the prawn cakes, chicken satay and spring rolls. Each dish was excellent and very delicious. For mains we shared a sweet and sour pork and scallops. The scallops were tasty and the sauce they were cooked in gave them a kick. The pork dish was average. The pieces of pork were very small and they felt like lumps of minced pork that had been deep fried. Friends we were with all enjoyed their dishes, so personally I recommend the restaurant but think some dishes will be hit and miss. The service was very good and the waiters were very professional. I found the atmosphere outside warmer than inside given that the seating is by the water overlooking Marina Bay Sands. We did have a table outside but had to move inside due to the rain

We had dinner at Sabai Fine Thai. We had a seafood soup and some springrolls as a starter and a Green Chicken Curry and Gung Op Wunsen (baked prawns with noodles).It was 2 big portioned and it was nice but nothing special and it did cost quite a lot.Overall I would say there are better Thai restaurants in Singapore for this price

Following pre-dinner drinks with a friend at Prelude, our group went on to Sabai for dinner. I was very impressed with the range of Thai food on the menu and we had 4 mains between 3 of us so we could try various things. The red Thai beef was good, green Thai prawns Lso good although the prawns were a little on the small side, but the pad Thai noodles and pork ribs were great, if maybe a little on the small side. The star for me was the chicken satay we had as a starter....I could'veeaten 2 or 3 of them and been very happy. With all the drinks included, as well as post-dinner spirits, at SG$300 I guess you'd say it was a bit on the pricey side but for 3 of us to have had such a good time with great tasting food, that seemed acceptable to us all

Highly recommended. Fresh produce with striking flavours.A great menu, including wines. Modern and traditional menu.Requested a slight change to a dish to highlight flavours I felt like at the time and the Chef accommodated my request and produced a superb dish. I'll return when next in Singapore.

Authentic Thai recipes...good ambience. Situated on the buzzing Orchard Road

Close to the financial district, very nice views, great food with decent prices

I have dine / had a lunch at Sabai quite a few times. The location is very convenient. The food is generally good and I am quite sure you will not be disappointed, albeit I am not specialist in Thai cousine so can not comment on its authenticity. In any case anything I have ordered was tasteful.... But.The service is a real disappointment. Perhaps half of the issues are caused by their weak English,half can be attributed to the lack of basic training. Like if you dine in group it is normal to expect tge food to be served at the same time. It should be normal to assume that starters will be brought first...It is a pitty that a place with good kitchen and location does not capitalize its potential

Sabai Fine Thai, located near Marina Bay serves the best Thai food, I have had in Singapore. I am a vegetarian and they have a great selection. There is a fresh taste in the food and is authentic. I tried the olive fried rice, Green veg curry and Pomelo salad. Thai Lemon Grass tea was outstanding. Must visit for a genuine Thai food lover

The two of us went to for dinner and we picked a table overlooking Marina Bay Sands. The overall ambience, view and the flickering candlelight on the table made the night an exceptionally enjoyable one. Service was good too, staff was very friendly, attentive and prompt. Food is authentic as well, tried the clear seafood tomyam soup and green curry. My favourite would be the mango sticky rice, it's very fragrant yet not too sweet. I would definitely be back again. Just one thing, be prepared to pay quite a bit for the dining experience. :

Sabai Fine Thai, located along the marina near the Fullerton Hotel, serves some excellent Thai food, as well as some rather wanting. Try an outdoor table. While the view is not directly of the water, itâ€™s still nice.Stick to the choices near the top of the menu, particularly for the tom yum soups and the curries. The ones further down the menu tend to be undistinguished. However, the duck in red curry sauce was quite nice.Good, friendly service. I would go back

This is about the one located in Takashimaya:The food is good. Especially the sea bass in lime and lemon grass soup; it smells and tastes just great. But the service is so terrible that kills all your experience at the restaurant. When we went there we had to wait half an hour for our cocktails and after we asked 3 times, they told us that the spirits were finished. Hey, there is a big supermarket just 3 floors downstairs in the same building open until late. Just go down and buy what you need! I saw my food going to the wrong table twice, than back into the kitchen and finally to my table. Needless to say that it was already cold. You wait 10 minutes for a beer and so much time for each dish even when the restaurant is half empty. All the good food experience is killed by the bad service that makes you mad because you think that they forgot your order and you keep asking etc. Don't go there if you have guests

Sabai at Custom's house is a very good option for bit more elegant dinner. Their Thai dishes are very nice and the choice is more then sufficient. Also the prices are reasonable (for S'pore).The problem is the service. Most of the guys there do not speak much English and also they are not properly trained. Otherwise it would not happend that the meals are not served at once, they can't recommend a wine and usually mix up the orders. All these are small things and could be fixed easily would there be will.So give it a try but do not expect "european" standards of service

Went with my wife for quick dinner. Eat Pat Thai, Satay and Yam Som etc. All excellent, with chearful service and nice location overlooking the Fullerton Bay hotel and the marina. Good view of the light show at 8.00pm if you are interested. Not cheap but the best of the Customs House places. Lunch menu good value if you fancy that

My choice of dish (Green Thai Curry) was not exactly an adventurous choice but the spices took care of that :) It was like putting 6 red hot chillies in my mouth. Main criticism is that there wasn't much chicken in it - mostly vegetables and 70% cherry eggplants (bitter). It was naieve for me not to have requested it milder given I was in Singapore where they like it hot and to be fair the waiter did offer to change it even though it was once I had requested the bill. However I still enjoyed my short sitting by the waterside as it is a lovely view. Its on the financial district so attracts a business type crowd

Excellent Thai food. Service is good. Kid-friendly. Pity they reduce the size of the dessert buffet.

Ex Thanying chef.. how can we not go?

Love its roast duck green curry with fruit in it and its dessert counter

Fantastic stuffed chicken wings and clear tom yum soup...what a kick! not crazy about the duck in green curry though. And he waterchestnut bits encased in green gelatin is yummy in my tummy!

Went to Sabai at custom's house for a dinner with business partners. The food was good, but nothing special. What has disappointed me was the lack of professionalism from waiters side. They do have decent choice of wine, but apparently do not know how to serve it. Also when I have asked them to save for my bag, they refused saying that they do not have facilities for it. Maybe you would say that these are small things, but they have spoiled the whole experience. Not sure whether I will return

I love eating at the Customs House branch of Sabai. Sitting outside overlooking the water is a really lovely atmosphere. The food is always great. It's rather pricey compared to other eateries in Singapore but for a treat with friends or visitors it always goes down well. The deep fried garoupa fillets are amazing, the pad thai is authentic and tasty and their mango salad is to die for. My friends also rave about the curries. They have a good wine selection and the staff are very attentive, bringing more rice/iced water often. I've never had to book a table to be seated on a weekday evening - though be warned that it is closed on Sundays

Went to this restaurant for my birthday dinner - I have to say they serve thai food with a great touch gourmet however it comes with a pretty hefty price tag. The food is well worth the money in my opinion. They have some truly unique thai dishes on the menu which you wont find at a Thai Express or a normal run of the mill thai restaurant. Their menu is well crafted with plenty of dishes to choose from. The host/hostess know the menu and can provide you with recommendations on what and how much to order. If you sit outside you get a great view of the marina bay sands skyline. We had gone when the weather was nice and cool - on a hot evening it may not be the best idea. The interior of the restaurant is quite nice and posh - well chosen artwork and lighting it just right. Not too bright and not too low and dim as well where you find it hard to see what is on your plate.Overall opinion - great food, pricey but if you can afford it you will definitely visit again

The ambience is not bad and the location in Takashimaya is pretty convenient. The food is ok. I went a few dishes and most of them were fine. The pandan chicken though was really bad. Pineapple rice is one of the better dishes I would recommend. The other problem was that everytime i was there, food was pretty cold. And since the plates are not warm either. by the time you are half way through the food, your food is completly cold. The service is not great compared to Singapore standards. Overall the palce is ok, but i would not go if I have other options

Disappointing! Especially the seabass steamed in lime juice. Even the dessert buffet was a far cry from the one at Thanying. Other dishes from the ala carte menu are of acceptable standard - nothing outstanding. Service is rather mediocre for a place that claims to be the best

We are regular customer here, always come for their great duck curry and mango salad. Great staffs, one of the best in Singapore, a rare gem indeed. Location is not the most exciting place (just a boring Orchard road shopping mall!) but convenient. We normally combine the trip there with book shopping @ Kinokuniya
