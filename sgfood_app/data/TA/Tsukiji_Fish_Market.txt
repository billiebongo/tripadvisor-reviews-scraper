My booking with them was to celebrate my friend's birthday. Though no special privileges but overall the experience was wonderful. Definitely can visit again with the reasonable price and good food.

So Sumiya leaves and is replaced by this operator. Decor has changed a little. Food is average but location is good and price is decent
4
Nice little place. Food was pretty good. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Would definitely come back again.
4
Good service, nice & spacious environment, pricing is generally affordable. The raw items are fresh except uni & hotate which are average in freshness, can't taste their natural sweetness. Cooked food are okay, nothing particular stands out. It's ideal for gathering.
4
The place offers quite a range of sashimi’s and chirashi don but if you don’t eat raw food there still are some hotpot cod and grilled squid which are great and really fresh tasting
5
Very good food but place ca. Get abit noisy. Food servings and services were pretty efficient. Only point is that staff should have been better trained (e.g when serving / clearing utensils to avoid accidents or disturbing the clients from cleanings without warning .
3
I went for dinner, even the place was half empty it took 5/10 min to be seated.
Ok oysters (good value for money) ok scallop sashimi, price reasonable.
The restaurant looks tired
4
Here for small reunions with college mate, great place! Food is average and a bit overpriced but definitely worthy because of the service
4
First of all, I requested window seating during my booking and this was provided. The view from the high floor where the restaurant is situated is quite nice and adds to the atmosphere. My husband and I enjoyed the dining experience of good quality sashimi, tempura and there was nothing we ordered that we didn't like. The service was prompt and courteous
2
Came here with a friend after reading a review from a local food blogger. Ordered the sashimi platter which was very appeasing to the eyes. Quality was ok. Had tempura, bara chirashi, overpriced small bowl of miso that cost $8+. Service staff looks glum - never smile at all. Youâ€™ll probably get better value for money Japanese elsewhere.
4
Not many people during weekdays. Ordered maki, don and fries. Seafood was fresh but the fries were quite tasteless. No seaweed and truffle taste. The mentaiko sauce did not have the mentaiko taste. Maki was average.
3
Was expecting much more from this jap restaurant, but somehow fell short of expectations. Food was generally acceptable but nothing to rav about. Only thing special that we liked was the cheesed-baked rice in crab shell. Small portion but was the highlight of the meal.
4
Like the service there, as staff were helpful with making sure that we are comfortably sat at our table when we have a 2 young children and a few bulky shopping bags and a stroller.
The food was good. Liked the sashimi.
2
Raw fish was fresh but the crab and prawn were just so so. For the price, quality was disappointing.
They also forgot some of the dishes we ordered until we asked.
3
The food was alright and we didn’t have to spend a lot. However, getting the attention of the staff seemed to be a problem although the restaurant wasn’t full.
5
Reasonable price with fresh ingredients. Definitely will go back for more. Fast serving. If you like seafood + Japanese cuisine, it’s one of the reasonably price restaurant to visit. Oyster lovers, reminder “a must” to order.
4
Very yummy miso crab rice, and lunch set is value for money! Fresh fish and very nice ambience too! Will Visit again.
4
The food was really wonderful- especially if you like fresh, quality sashimi. The unagi tasted really good, but not everyone might be able to handle the strong fishy taste of the sea urchin in the special bara chirashi sushi don bowl. We also noticed a couple of Japanese, who seemed like regulars in the restaurant enjoying a drink and food there. With the service being relatively good, the price being affordable and the nice ambience, whether its for social, business or date nights, this is a great restaurant to visit

It is a centrally located resturant on the rooftop of Orchard Central (12th floor). It has a comprehensive menu from entree to dessert. However the decoration, ambience, service, food & value is rather forgettable. Nothing memorable. Just a quick fixed for Japanese food. We shared Entree, Sashimi, Don, Ramen... About S$35 per head for small eater. Pretty forgettable and an average Japanese resturant
4
Great place for japanese food but because this restaurant has 5 concepts, their menu comes in laminated pieces and they tend to be confusing for first timers.Staff are friendly and helpful although they can be shorthanded at times. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place if you want to try out good and reasonably priced Japanese food
4
Although a bit expensive but worth it to eat because the food very fresh and nice. The service is good.
5
their food are good, service & ambience are good too :)
We order Salmon and Salmon Roe Don, Tsukiji Special Bara Chirashi Sushi Don & Charcoal Grilled Eel over Rice in box, all are very delicious & fresh!
2
Below average food and service. Place wasnr even crowded but a a simple request to change tables was given a rude reply. Many other alternatives that are worth the money
5
Celebrate my best friend's birthday day, the foods were good. A very nice place for gatherings. Staffs were friendly and got the orders correctly even tho it's a large table.
2
We ordered the sashimi platter, everything was not fresh we almost gagged while eating. The bill was $96 for two, no ambience either - it felt like a cheap casual dining place. For the price point I definitely will not visit again
3
service was top notch at tsukiji fish market however for the value in terms of chirashi-don and sashimi slices, to be honest sushi bar will be a better place..
5
Located at the rooftop garden with floor-to-ceiling glass window for a grand view of the city. Sea urchin and Jumbo sweet prawn have no surprise while Seared Foie Gras Sushi and Hokkaido Scallop with Roe are must-tries.
5
The variety is good and food is of good quality. In particularly, the grilled squid and tempura dishes are marvellous.
4
The food is yummy and service is fast. price is okay. The place is a bit small and atmosphere is casual.
3
Staff gave the wrong information and I ended ordering a portion that is too small to satisfy, but too much for me to order a second dish. Food quality is average and portions are too small and overly priced compared to other dining areas in orchard. Place is really noisy as well and more suited to groups who like to bask in the atmosphere.
3
think they were short on staff so service was abit slow. Sashimi was alright but definitely not the freshest. disappointing given its name and reputation. was also looking forward to the much raved-about bara chirashi don, sadly it was also average.
4
We had our usual chirashi don and red garoupa. The food was fresh as usual! Service was great too! Do reserve a table in advance as it gets quite crowded after 7pm
4
Had the cheese wagyu beef patty which tasted unique. Price point was a little steep for a meal that contained no other sides though. However, service is stellar!
3
I am a repeat customer. Was impressed with previous visits, so returned for lunch on a weekday when I was in the area. Ordered the chirashi don. For $39.90, found the serving small and the cuts of seafood miserable. Could probably get more value elsewhere.
5
That my favourite dinning area. Flesh seafood and nice beef. Been patrolling numerous time, will nv sick of it. Feels like eating in Japan.
2
One of the worst ever salmon don I ever tasted. With the price I am paying, I can get something better at other restaurants. Totally not value for money.
3
They have a variety of dishes, from hotpot to ramen to Don. Our group tried and shared the Tsukiji Special Bara Chirashi Sushi Don, Tuna Don and Tempura tendon. The dinner was alright, but the freshness of the sashimi just could not live up the standards we had just tasted in the famous Tokyo fish market a few months ago. Might give the other dishes a try the next time
3
Food was not as delicious as our previous trips there. Had the tendon which came our luke warm. Not as fresh and piping hot as we had. Taste wise, the sauce was not enough. Even the rice was not as fragrant as before. Left still feeling hungry. The seats were not as comfortable also, the table height was quite low, and I had to slouch to eat. Not sure if we're going back again.
5
I never liked Japanese curry but decided to try this when they had one for one and it was so good I went back again! It's not peppery and abit sweet but it was yummy and the chicken was crispy and juicy. Rice was soft and fragrant
4
The friendly headwaiter & waiting staff were both very firnedly & seated us immediately. We eachordered chirashi-don (all-time favourite) as mains with a salad & side appetizers. The wait for our mains tends to take rather long during the peak times (e.g. Friday evenings, weekends) but the salad or appetizer came quickly & our tea got topped-up frequently, which was nice :-) On the four previous occasions I've been here, the restaurant has a happy, relaxed buzz. Always pleasant to be able to admire the rooftop garden view after our meal here. Will definitely be back again.
4
Set comes with Miso soup, salad and pickles. Fish was served in a hot stone plate along with cherry tomatoes, 2 long beans and 2 pieces of grilled potato. Appropriate portion. Adds up to approx. SGD24.50 per pax after tax.
3
Foods wasn't as fantastic as expected for the price we are paying. Most of the crew can't speak English.
5
Fresh & nice food, service and atmosphere with reasonable price.
1 of my favourite Japanese restaurant after 1st visit.
3
Nice restaurant with a great view.. Oysters are fresh..
Sashimi is so so this time round, it was better during my last visit..
3
There was a wide selection of food on the various menus available. We ordered the hotpot cod fish, salmon-tuna-swordfish don & ebi tempura don. The food was alright but not fantastic
4
Food is nice and the price is reasonable for orchard area. Service is prompt. Need to take lifts to 11th floor before transferring to escalator to 12th floor.
5
Generous serving of sashimi and overall dining experience is great. Will definitely go back there again. Keep up the great work!
4
Variety of food available. E.g. Ramen, pasta, sushi dons and ten dons not forgetting ala cartes. Food was great. Place is so-so not much of an ambience and server can be more attentive (tho most probably we were seated in a corner). Will most likely go back and check out other dishes again if in the vincity.
4
It's a good place if you n your party can't decide on the type of Japanese food you want. You have three or four different menus to choose from tempura, sashimi maki sushi or soba/ ramen. We tried one of 2 Michelin Bib gourmand ramen n a yellow tail collar grilled - both were gooood. Our waitress was very attentive but getting to the place is unwieldy and the place looks a bit cluttered and the seats not very comfortable
4
My friend asked for a change of table and the staff were very accommodating. Even checked back to ensure we were comfortable and the sun was not too bright (they lowered the shades voluntarily). Very attentive and friendly. Food is good and reasonably priced. Canâ€™t wait to be back
