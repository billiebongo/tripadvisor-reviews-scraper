There are many such restaurants around the area and as such we tried this one too ... The food is decent specifically the Non Veg version .. Nothing great but neither bad ..
3
its in indian market not far from mustafa shopping center but veg lover i dont advice here.indian non veg lover may like it but not a great place as far my concern
5
Excellent service, great atmosphere and great food. Best Butter Chicken we've had, tasty tandoori chicken. Great value and size of generous portions
3
We visited amber last evening and were overall satisfied with the food and experience.
Few sugfestions for improvement:
1. Service is little slow
2. Paneer tikka was blad but mushroom chilli was great.
Overall wont mind going back in
4
Lamb chili was 8 points, but garlic naan was really good. And chicken tikka masala, my wife order, was best one at long time
3
We eat at this restaurant mostly when we crave for momos, as it’s one of very few restaurants in SG serving momos... FYI momos is a Nepalese version of dumplings...Momos are good... chutney too... spicy n yummy... though can’t compare with authentic versions..Other food is just tastes average or a bit better than average... so we don’t visit it when we need good authentic Indian food as there many other options in this area...Another good thing I like is outdoor seating ... enjoy it especially in good weather..
4
We went there for chicken , ordered chicken , ate chicken , loved chicken ... We ordered Tikka and Tandoori and some kebabs .. they were very nice .. wasnt expecting but they surprised us .. srvice is decent .. ambience is average .. nothign great except for the chicke
5
First night in Singapore we chanced upon Amber and tried it out. Great staff, interesting roadside views and .....really excellent Indian food. Both the Garlic Naan and Dal Tadka were absolutely delicious (as was the Tiger Beer and a nice G&T !). So after 3 nights in this wonderful city, we decided to return for our final meal. Once more it was just excellent with a memorable Tandoori platter. Next time in Singapore, we will definitely make a return visit to Amber
5
Me and my husband ate here today, the food was sublime! We had half tandoori chicken with a mutton rogan josh and the mutton Mysore. They were all outstanding dishes, with an exceptional garlic naan to accompany. We both eat curry at least twice a week at home and currys from all corners and this food was at the top great value for money too

Sept. 2017 . This Restaurant is in Little India in Singapore . The Food is excellent ! I ate CHicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Bread , it was wonderfull The Priceis very fair .The Restaurant is nice , it is possible to sit outside . The Staff very nice and friendly . If you are in Little India : Visit this Restauran
4
They serve good chicken Briyani and naans. Do try the garlic naan, is good. Price is decent for this restaurant.
3
It is located in front of Hotel Broadway in little India. It is kind of an open to street restaurant serving until midnight. I had their mutton Biriyani for Dinner and it was delicious! the portion was large too.
5
We loved soaking up the street atmosphere. Had chicken tikka with raita and naan breads, butter chicken and rice with drinks for under $45 plus loved the fans.
5
Delicious Vegetarian and Non Vegetarian foods served almost original indian taste in Singapore one must try the staff is too good had a wonderful experience. Yummy Yummy.....
4
Though I am a vegetarian, my husband and his friends loved Tandoori Chicken at this restaurant. We have been visiting this place for many years, services staff used to very friendly and warm and they remember most of their (regular) customers. North indian dishes are pretty good, not best though. It used to be more delicious earlier compared to recent times. But overall, it's value for money
5
Have been dining here for the last 3 years almost every month. The food here is the best indian food i had in singapore. The boys handling the restaurant are extremely courteous and hospitable. Pricing, portion, taste, service all make you a happy diner. Just love the place and keep recommending the restaurant
4
Amber Indian restaurant in Little India was very good and well pricedRestaurant located on a Main Street but that added to the ambiance The restaurant is open air with fans to keep the customers coolThe Nan bread was especially good but both dishes were very goodStaff were very pleasant and attentiveI like Indian food and I would return to this restaurant if I had more tim
4
I went here just to pass time until my friend arrives to Little India... Just ordered a Tiger Beer and Prawn fried rice... the beer was chilled and served well by the waiter... The rice arrived in 15 minutes as it takes little time to prepare since there is reasonable crowd... and it was very tasty... When my friend comes and he tasted the rice, then we ordered couple of beers and foods here... specially i love the location... having a chilled beer at the roadside restaurant was an awesome feel... Dont miss this food if u roam around little india..
5
I have been regular visitor to this restaurant. Its simple little bit noisy due to location is on road side but that is ok! Overall I like almost all dishes of this restaurant. I strongly recommend to go for it.. specially for western tourists who likes Indian Food must visit this
5
I got to know Amber through a friend. The 1st impression is that the restaurant is located right next to the bus stop, where you can have a glass of lasi and watch the world go by. The 2nd is about the food: wonderful!!! Butter Chicken and Palak paner are highly recommended. Garlic nan is a bless
4
☺️ I love this restaurant because it has my name in it. Overall the food was cooked just right and I enjoyed the little walk to the restaurant because I got to enjoy the scenery.
3
I was disappointed with my Nepalese meal as it was very bland,
Portions are good and the staff are friendly
5
Large variety of vegetarian food - huge portion of rice (order one eat 2 people) - fast service - good naan
1
Food and drinks is average.
But today found a piece of glass in veg manchurian for which the waiter apologized.
Won't visit ever again!!
4
Sat down and rested my feet. Ordered the Butter Chicken and Garlic Naan Bread. both were lovely! would def go back! Glass of wine only $8 as well. Cheap for Singapore!
5
I recently re-visited Amber for my birthday dinner and, as with previous visits, I was definitely not disappointed! The food was excellent! Tandoor-cooked chicken, meat, fish and prawns for starters, followed by chicken kadai and garlic naan. Definitely a "must" on the to-do list for Little India
2
I went to this Restaurant many times and the service and food is always good. As it was the good place nice indian and Nepalese food and sime chilled drinks, i decided to go down for drinks and food as it was my friend's last day in Singapore. But it was real disappointed. Sat down for more than 10 minutes but there was no one to provide us menus. After rising hand we go menus frome one of the waiter. No one offer us a drinks. Food was horrible. Ordered chicken vindaloo which was supposed to be spicy (also asked for extra spicy) but when served it was not spicy at all. Not recommended if you want to have nice Nepalese and Indian food
5
This is a good value Indian restaurant. They also serve Nepalese food. I have eaten here several times over the last few visits to Singapore and the standard of food & service is always the same, excellent and well priced. I can highly recommend this establishment
4
After a long day my partner was after some Indian food. For me it actually made no difference where to go, since I wasn’t hungry at all. We didn’t argue, because I like Indian as well.Amber was our choice, since we stayed in Little India, so it wasn’t far, and looked like a nice place. My partner chose a Chicken Korma , and he was satisfied with it. I had a Garlic and a Kashmiri Naan, that I shared with him, and a Mango lassi. It was all mine, to good to be shared.It wasn’t a big dinner, but for me it was enough, and after a fast and attentive service and friendly prices we left this restaurant with good feelings
3
I went to this restaurant for dinner and ordered the butter chicken with pilau rice and a mango lassi.The chicken was tasty, a hug portion which was fit for two persons. The herbs accompanying the rice made the impression, as if kitchen garbage was used here. It tasted accordingly. The lasse was allright, so was the service. In my opinion the food was overpriced for what I got.Overall the dinner was ok, but the next time I would go to a different place
4
Walked passed and it looked okay. The food and drink was good and not expensive.
The staff was friendly.
4
A very casual restaurant on Serangoon Road where you can relax and watch the world go by. The food was plentiful and delicious. I've seen it on past visits and am sorry that I didn't go sooner.
5
Exhausted after a morning shopping in Little India and spotted this restaurant for a quick refreshment and ended up staying for one of the nicest lunches we have had in Singapore. The very friendly waitperson was the enticement. Glad we stayed. I had chicken Marsala and pilau rice...very nice. My partner had Jhingea Mew (check spelling!) which was exceptional. Prawns in Pawpaw to keep it brief. The sauce was amazing and the whole dish was a taste sensation. I had half of it! It was a large meal. My partner was so impressed we went back the next day and begged for the recipe. No problem. Chef Mohan came and shared his recipe which was very generous of him. Thank you. We will definitely be back to this great little restaurant next time we are in Singapore. Service and food were excellent. Great value for great food

Started with a mango lassi. It had a nice, thick yogurt consistency, but the mango tasted like it was canned. Next came the Chicken Tandoori, which was absolutely fabulous! It came out on a sizzling platter with lots of spices and vegetables, and the flavor offered lots of promise for the rest of the meal. The next dish was the Mutton Rogan Gosht, which is claimed by Amber Restaurant (on their menu) as one of their house specialties. The dish was overly salty, to the point where none of the spices could come through. My friend had the Chicken Shahi Korma, which had a nice sweetness but was otherwise one-dimensional. I finished the meal with a Masala Tea, which was served far too hot and lacked the distinctively nutty and seed flavor that makes masala tea so special. It ended up being bland and bitter. To end on a positive note, their Butter Naan was excellent. This restaurant has several things they do well and many areas for improvement, so a three-out-of-five rating seems quite reasonable.
4
We were in Little India on the main Serangoon Road and we choose this out of three adjacent Indian restaurants. I had chicken Korma supposedly with pecans and cashews but if there were nuts they must have been crushed into a paste lost in the Korma curry sauce. However, the chicken curry was very good. My lady had a garlic naan and a thick mango shake which she said was very good. We were eating light because we had been sick from air conditioning and had done a lot of walking earlier
1
I ordered a chicken vindaloo but got just a plain old chicken curry. I am of Indian descent and yet they thought I might not know the difference between a vindaloo and a regular curry.. seriously.. I've grown up eating chicken curry and a vindaloo is my favourite dish to order at a restaurant.. I know the difference. Anyway, I didn't enjoy my meal. Never going back. I'm not even sure if it was freshly made curry either. They were probably trying to finish up their leftover food

I found this restaurant nestled in little India by accident. I was walking down the road of little India, starving and looking for some clean, fresh food. All the others I had been passing offered food that had been sitting out for hours and flies roaming about. I was tired and about to give up when I saw a waiter carrying steaming hot food. It's al dente. I immediately walked over and had a seat. Service was fast and the food was soo good. I had the garlic naan and the cheese naan. I wolfed them down, they were so delicious. Then my main dish came. I had chicken masala and fish tandoori. The masala tasted like tomato sauce made creamy with cheese but I was surprised to learn that the sauce was made with yogurt. The fish was also good. Best part is that they were prepared healthily and the ingredients were healthy. All for a moderate price. For the rest of my stay in Singapore, I couldn't find any other food to rival the taste of the food served here. It was just gastronomically satisfying. I recommend this restaurant
4
We recently visited this restaurant to try some Nepalese and Indian foods and they were great. Foods come in great portion so be aware before you order multiple meals. I personally felt like "reduce the price and meal portion" so that people won't waste foods. Overall the service was great, outdoor seating and great meals
3
The food here was just fantastic. But the waiting time was killing the mood. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated and another hour to be served. When we managed to order insufficient amount of naan bread we waited another 30(!!!) minutes for a refill. All in all highly recommended if you are very very patient and not extremely hungry :
1
Decided to try this place since it claimed to serve Nepali food as opposed to the mostly Indian fare offered by most Little India restaurants.The lassi we ordered was little more that milk with sugar. Those of us who ordered water didn't see it till the food arrived. The lollipop chicken arrived first (after 40 mins) and was basically blandly marinated chicken deep fried and poked with a bone. The soup then arrived only after we reminded one of the waiters that it had been 45 mins since we ordered. It turned out to be watery cream of chicken with a generous helping of salt. No herbs on top, no condiments on the side. Finally, the biryani which might've been the saviour turned out to be little more than the 'Nasi Brani' served locally (oily rice, dyed red and served with bits of chicken). Nothing like the actual biryani that is the crown of most (Indian) restaurant menus. And finally, no sooner had we received the bill than they ushered the next batch of guests over to our table who waited by the table apologetically while the waiter/manager cleared our table even as we were still seated at it.I'd recommend waiting a longer period elsewhere (since they make you wait 45 mins anyway) or simply going to 'Delhi Restaurant' right next door. The latter has MUCH better food and much warmer service

Found this place on a visit to Little India area. Food was very good quality, was plentiful and well presented. Chicken Tikka appetiser was my favourite. Was great value for what we had. Would recommend to others.
1
Came here with friends and as usual food was aweful, this is the last time I have visited this place
Service was good and people were friendly
4
open air restaurant in Little India, food is tasty, afterall its a great relief when u r tired of chinese food..
5
Visited on a busy day tried various differnt dishes in party I was with, all were great. Price was a lot lower than expected and atmosphere was like being in India.
4
A restaurant with much less expectations, we sat for a dinner. Gobi manchurian dry they served is all wat i never tasted ever before. Rest of the food is typical. A good place to try with friends. Not recommended for couples
3
Right smack on Serangoon Road with the Broadway Hotel Bus Stop right in front. This place is great for people watching but the food was just average. The menu and sign says they serve authentic Nepalese & Indian cuisine. Menu is extensive and has something for the veg and non-veg diners. Really nice table servers and always looking out for a wave of a hand for anything you need. Sunday streets can be quite crowded
4
I've walked past Amber Restaurant (north IOndian and Nelapese cuisine) which is outside of the Broadway Hotel a number of times (it's by the busy bus-stop) and never ventured in till today. And I was pleasantly surprised. The waiters were laid back but friendly. I ordered Murgh Amber Briyani (chicken bryani) - the rice was fluffy, yet full of flavour, with pieces of soft chicken mixed in with the rice and accompanied with a bowl of soupy curry. You get a 10% discount (removal of service charge) if you take out. I haven't tried the soup, mutton or kebabs that some reviewers mentioned, but I will try them in the future
5
Went to this restaurant today and all I can say is yum! Myself and my boyfriend ordered a curry each, rice and a plain nan bread. The portions were big one curry would have been enough for us! Food was tasty but a bit toned down on the spice level although we did order mild curries, I was over the moon with how mild it was my boyfriend wanted it hotter. Service was spot on and the meals came out quick! Overall I would recommend this restaurant to anyone even the kids! And I would recommend the butter chicken dish :)
3
We stopped here for a quick lunch figuring that anywhere in Little India must be good to survive. We weren't disappointed. The food was tasty, just what we were looking forward to. The staff were a bit too laid back, we had to ask to order, as did another table, but then we were outside of the normal lunch hour timeframe. We had two of their lunch specials, a chicken and mutton dish. Both were tasty and tender. The serves were bigger than we anticipated for lunch, but we had no trouble finishing our meal. The only disappointment was that there were no samosas available ..
5
We stayed at broadway hotel just above this resturant. used to eat mostly here. Nice and friendly boys serving good food. The portions are good for 2 people and a young child. My 6yr old son asked for Egg Parantha (Prata) which they don't serve, yet they made is on special request, every time we asked for it. Special thanks to Pahadi boy who always took order from us. Highly Recommend
5
Beautiful food in Little India. Authentic and flavoursome. Value for money. Loved it and the service was great. Dining late at night was not a problem.
5
Visited Little India and had a superb lunch. All meals were excellent and very tasty, I would recommend this restaurant.
3
Went for lunch ,very average,very reasonable,hit the spot for a quick light lunch.The restaurant was quite busy,the service was friendly and good .It is situated in the heart of Little India.
4
Our friend who lives in Singapore had treated us for dinner in this restaurant. The Kebabs were simply mouth watering. The Pilaf so well made. The mutton so soft. The ambience was also good.
4
Typical in many respects with typical tourist items and reasonable prices. Convenient to departure from Sentosa
4
This restaurant is just outside the Broadway Hotel.
Chicken Biryani is good. Both the quantity and the taste.
Value of Money.
4
The hotel apart from delicious Indian Cuisine offers great Indian chartbusters also, which is one off experience in a city like Singapore.
5
Amber Tandoor is in the heart of Little India. Fish masala was great. Atmosphere in January evening was cool. Also had biryani and chicken masala. Prices are on a bit higher side. But overall a good restaurant.
5
Food is great here. The chicken momos are a must try. The butter chicken, chicken biryani and egg curry are great too. Not expensive, and definitely worth the price.
5
This probably sounds like faint praise coming from a westerner, but this is honestly the best Indian food I have ever tasted. Reasonable price. The momos are a great starter. We went with a large group so I had a chance to try several of the curries and all were fantastic. The mutton, which can sometimes be tough, was tender and delicious. A must try if you find yourself in this part of Singapore
3
food was expensive, for what we got. The taste was ok but the price was too much. seating is available for about 20 - 25 people. the menu is not extensive but rather average.
4
Great Indian food . Naan /Dal/Kofta was well made. Serviced with a smile. Seemed to be fairly priced.
4
Well priced and nice tasting food. Very authentic. We were sitting out next to the street and it was good to watch the traffic and people go by. It was very busy when we were there.
4
Went pass this place walking in Little India and in need for a beer, and I also stayed for dinner. I first had a vegetable soup which was excellent in it's simplicity, and then some large shrimps also very well prepared. Indian food, but not too spicy for me not used to that, even though they they had spicy food as well in the menu. Recommended
4
Much of Singapore is rather sterile - not so Amber - in the heart of Little India this felt a little more adventurous than most of the places we went. The service was excellent - friendly and attentive. We are given excellent guidance on the dishes available and warned where they thought we may have chosen something a little hot for western tastes! However none of the dishes were too hot and we tried a range of food that we would not usually eat in England. All the food was tasty and the mix of spices was excellent - well worth a visit
4
A great little spot on busy Serangoon, set back enough from the street to enjoy an outdoor meal in peace. Friendly waiters, excellent food, and reasonable prices made our dinner very enjoyable. We ordered the mixed grill, which came with a copious variety of deliciously seasoned meat and is a good way to have a variety of food without having an overly heavy meal. There was a wide range of seasoned naan options as well and vegetarian choices for those so inclined. The mango lassi was a great way to end the meal
3
There are not many restaurants that serve momos well and these guys certainly did. Having had amazing momos in North India, I was skeptical that I would get similar quality here but boy these were good! We even tried their kebab platter and it has a reasonable serving size and good tasting reshmi kebab. Do try the kebabs.Drinks were also pretty reasonably priced and the selection of alcohol is good. Will definitely go back here to chill when I'm there next
3
Visited in January when the outside temperature had dropped to below 30 degrees (with a breeze) making this outdoor restaurant comfortable. Right beside the busy Serangoon Road is a good location for experiencing Little India. The food was good, beer ice cold and the price reasonable.
4
We went yesterday for dinner at this restaurant. We didn't ordered much but was quite happy with the food they have served.Tried steam chicken monos, tandoori chicken starter, butter chicken. Momos were really soft and so was chicken. I liked the tandoori chicken the most it was marinated nicely. Mint chutney has lovely tangy taste. Overall food was nice ! Could be that many people don't like open restaurant as it is next to the road.
4
We went to celebrate with dinner at this food joint with trepidation as some of the reviews online were unsavoury for Amber. How wrong they were! We had the mutton korma nawabi, butter chicken, garlic naan, steamed chicken momo, and lots more, with sweet lassi (yogurt drink) & beer. Great food in the middle of Little India. We didn't like one dish and they took it off our bill to our delight! We paid a total of $120 for the seven of us, very reasonable for the magnificent kormas and curries. Nepalese and Indian food fare! We'll be back for sure
