This is the closest we could find to an English bar. Several kitchens serve the bar so the selection of food is good. Service is good. Nice atmosphere. Just across the road from one of the entrances to the Botanic Gardens.

This is our favourite bar in our neighbourhood in Bukit Timah. Good selection of draft bars, with burgers from Burger Bar, Thai and Indian food. Pretty relaxed and open aires atmosphere.

Not a bad local spot - shame the Mexican place closed down. Wish all of the food outlets took credit card though!
Charcoal pit is nice, boss's fave is a great burger.

Basic and pricy as is all of Singapore. “Happy hour” prices at $9 (£5) a pint doesn’t make me smile only grimace. Various food can be ordered which again is average tasting and not cheap albeit in a cheap basic setting with disgusting toilets Handy if living local and that’s about it.

When you visit will determine the type of experience you have here. I went to get something to eat at about 5:00 pm and things were quiet. By 6:00 pm, the crowd was starting to build. I live nearby, so a few days later, I walked by at around 9:00 pm and the place was hopping.Early in the day, I saw mostly families, many with their children, getting something to eat. Later in the evening, there were still families, but many more of the tables had adults, either eating, or out for a drink. I will need to go back around 9:00 pm for a beer to see what this place is like after dinnertime.I tried the Indian food and was pleased. The Naan was some of the best I have had. The butter chicken was excellent. When I was there, they had a Carlsberg pint for $9.00 for happy hour. By Singapore standards, that is a good price

Bar Bar at 879 is my local and a place, either on my own or with my family, I visit regularly.There's always a great buzz about the place and you won't feel out of place on your own, with your kids running around; or a group of friends. There are also some great happy hour promotions and I think, either Monday or Tuesday, all evening pints are $9! The food selection is decent - Burgers, Thai/ Malay, and Indian, although I think the Indian is a little on the pricey side but still, it's good, and you can't really complain about the overall price/ value.Friendly bar staff, cold beer, and pretty decent food. You can't go wrong

I visited this place regularly for two years, but I'm sad to say that it has gone down hill in recent months, particularly with respect to the Indian kitchen. A while back, the indian went by the name Sher - it was run by a very nice couple, the food was excellent, particularly given the reasonable prices. Now Sher is gone and has been replaced by Shaan. The food is still cheap, but the quality is nowhere near as good. Most of all though, the service is terrible. I visited about 6 weeks ago on quite a busy Saturday. I placed an order and 90 minutes later hadn't even received pappadums. When I went and asked, it became clear that they had forgotten our order. They rushed to fill it and got the dishes wrong. I sought a refund and then left.On my next visit, the service was quicker, but they missed a dish which I had to go and chase up.I went again tonight - there were 3 tables occupied when we arrived. I placed an order and once again waited for an hour only to discover that they had failed to make the food. I overheard the table next to us having the same issue.If such a mistake happens once I am disappointed , but can understand, especially on a busy night. But twice in three visits tells me that they don't know what they are doing and as a consequence I won't be going back. I'd like to emphasize that I haven't ordered from either the thai kitchen or the burger place and so I can't comment on their food or service. The drinks service was swift, although I had to request the drinks bill several times

Cold beer, friendly service, several takeaway eateries nearby to choose between Thai, Indian etc and have at your table. Relaxed, indoor and outdoor, this is a great local spot. These bars are all over town but this one has a unique feel thanks to its leafy surrounds, and including the lauded original Violet Oon Peranakan restaurant right next door and a great Chinese Hawkers style eatery at the other end of the block. Very popular with locals in the know, as an easy spot to walk to or park

Great place for a drink and some good value food from the surrounding outlets. Place has been tidied up with some new furniture and is always pleasant

Our friends took us here last year making it worthy of another visit this year. The kitchen area has been refurbished and still offers a choice of Singaporian, Indian, Chinese and Burgers from different vendors. Food is very good but could be considered a bit pricey for what is essentially street food,

Relaxed place to have a nice diner with family and kids. Many different dishes to choose from. The tamarind prawns where delicious. The spring rolls a great starter.
Many reasons to come back.

If you want to go for a quick, easy dinner, this place is worth a visit. Good selection of different cuisines (Indian, Thai, Mexican, Japanese) und a well equipped bar with regional and draft beers.
You'll find a lot of expats there.

Still a good place for a beer on your way home. Bartenders change very often, but good atmosphere. Food outlets now also offer mexican food.
Worth a visit

Curries were great, wings were okay. Overall feel is a local spot which has lots of regulars. The Indian food was the best of all we sampled, though they have a good variety!

Took a party of 8 with ages 6 years and up for a nice easy meal. Shared a bucket of beer (4x500ml stubbies) and had a selection of Indian, vegetarian pizza, Thai and a chicken burger.It was very open with large canvas awnings that kept us dry in the sudden intense Singaporean downpour.Prices were quite reasonable, comparatively speaking, but BRING CASH

This is basically a bar with some restaurant concessions (a Thai and an Indian). Unfortunately the bar has just changed hands and they have hiked up their prices massively. I don't take well to being ripped off, so sadly the concessions will now be losing business because of greedy owners of Bar Bar.

I have been going there for a few years and just found out about change of ownership taking place. The beers are still fine but the food at the Indian station has completely changed for the worst. Portions are much smaller, there is a lot of sauce for very little meat, prices are therefore now very high for what you get. It is more canteen like, which is a real shame as previous owner was very sociable and was obviously caring about what was going into his customers' mouths. Papadoms no longer complimentary and are 2 dollars for substandard ones. Very very very disappointed, the crowds at the Chinese eateries next door will only continue to see growing queues to get in as a result, leaving empty tables at this once overcrowded bar. Or simply stop serving food and focus on the drinks....

Bar Bar Black Sheep's concept is really cool - you get beers and a choice of Indian, Thai or Western food. The beers are good and reasonably priced. The curries at the Indian stall are really tasty and reasonably priced, but they put too much food colouring in the dishes. When I am ordering Indian I always do takeaways rather than eat there, for a very simple reason - for some bizzare reason the indian stall does not have any knives! It is a bit strange that they expect you to cut the chunky chicken pieces in a chicken tikka entree with a fork and spoon. The Western stall right beside the Indian stall has knives but they get a bit grumpy if you use their knife to eat the indian food. I really can't understand why the indian stall can't invest in knives to give their customers a good dining experience. But overall it is a good place

~3 eateries to choose from & SHER is my favorite for Fish Briyani :)~You can top up for the gravy but I prefer it without, so heavenly a teste from freshly tossed cooked basmati rice grains of delicious goodness ALWAYS 3x YUMz~there's always 5 or more chunks of fish filet hidden in the biryani you can't miss them with every bite you're bound to bite off a morsel & more

We sat ourselves down at a table and the service staff came to take our orders. When another big party arrived, the staff came over and promptly told us 'Can you please move!' because they needed the table. Towards closing time, they hovered around the table half an hour before closing time. Rather than saying it politely, we were basically shooed off. Guess our service standards have gone to the dogs. The paying customer is made to feel as if they are such a nuisance.
