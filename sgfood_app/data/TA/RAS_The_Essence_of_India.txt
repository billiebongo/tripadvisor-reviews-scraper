Having eaten in here a few years ago with work colleagues, and looking for Indian food on Clarke Quay, we stopped here as a family. Prices are a little steeper due to the location I guess, but food was tasty and service good. Would return.
4
Overall good view and food but was very crowded on new year eve. The waiting time was not too long if you have reservation.
4
Great food and a pleasant ambience. The service was quite good. We tried a few mocktails and enjoyed them. Good vegetarian choices. Great service
4
We visited this place on Valentine's day. Situated in clarke quay,Excellent location along the Singapore river. Food was a little expensive but tasted good overall. Tried Singapore sling which was also good
5
We did not dine here but took a take away . Excellent food which has flavor and taste, the location is great but then so is of all restaurants at Clarke Quay . Yes it is expensive but then it fine dining not a regular off the mill food .Do go there 
4
Location is great, by the river, service was good, if not a little slow off the mark when busy. Food was good old fashioned Indian food, nothing special if you are from the UK, price of a beer was eye watering, food wasn't cheap. Overall around £100 equivalent for 4 currys (no starters) and 2 beers plus shared rice. We enjoyed the night but just felt a little like a tourist trap
5
Very busy restaurant, fantastic service and amazing food. The chicken Chettinad was delicious. Portion sizes generous, and drinks nice and cold. Great value for money would visit again

Hospitality...... Clarke quay is one of the most happening place for youngsters and Indians after leisure and pleasure, the way to there heart is good Indian food. The restaurant fulfills all the expectations. A warm welcome and some Indian faces in a virgin place.Taste....... Superb although on a higher side but the location and place compensates that. Damages......A family of four could easily spend 90-100 Singapore dollars.Ambience....... perfect on the banks of the river an open dining area covered with canopy and a full fledged covered restaurant too.Suggestions......if you happen to be at Clarke quay then do try this novelty for its food and electrical atmosphere
4
This restaurant has a lovely view of the Clarke Quay. The setting is vibrant and colourful at night. We really enjoyed our meals which were full of flavour, with just the right amount of heat. Service was on the slower side and prices on the higher side.
4
Located at the Clarke quay side on the banks of the river, this place has both outdoor and indoor seating’s. The menu covers the starters to the curries section. Prices are on the higher side and the staff service was ok. On this side of the Clarke quay – this is the only Indian restaurant amongst all the pubs and houses. The food was just fine
4
It's locate in one of the most happening places in Singapore-clarke quay. There is an option to dine inside or outside near the river. The food was nice and quick service. The staff was friendly, however they didn't wait to take full order and had to be called a couple of times to take the order.The food was not spicy at all, which was good considering the kids
3
Even though we did not come here for food, we enjoyed our time having a drink with a great view of the Singapore river.Service was good enough, drinks were cold enough.
3
The location of the restaurant is great. Right on the banks of Clarke quay and with all those lightings at night it's really good. It's usually full. But food was just ok and so was the service. We had ordered kebab for starters and roti sabzi main course . Bhindi was saltless . I will have second thoughts to visit the place.apart from ambience I don't see any preference for visiting it
5
Truly one of the best Butter Chicken ever!!Not tasted anything like that since Mumbai. Vindaloo was excellent. Huge serves, great staff. My go to in Singapore
3
Dear Management,Can you please let us know if they serve halal Meat.We have visited your place but i had vegetarian since i was not sure of the meat. I didnt find in any of your blogs mentioning halal. your response is appreciated
5
A small jewel in the middle of Clarke Quay. I went there a couple of times and enjoyed butter curry and korma, all perfectly spiced with great naan accompanied with a beer.Service is friendly and they have a nice terrace along Singapore riverIt is a bit more expensive but it is Clarke Quay and the location is great
5
located on the scenic Clarks Quay this palce has a great view of the Quay and serves great Indian food.. a boon for Indian struggling to get good veg food in Singapor
5
We had a lovely meal here. It is a little expensive but you expect that due to the location. We had a table for two right by the waters edge. We started with a share platter for two that had Tandoori Prawn, Fish, Lamb and chicken which was presented on a sizzling platter.We also had a main course of Lamb Rogan Gosht and a Bhuna Gosht that were very tasty. Also rice and Naan bread. We would highly recommend this restaurant for authentic Indian meal
4
Decided to eat here on our first night in Singapore and wasn't disappointed. The menu had something for everyone. We had delicious onion Bhaji to start with...always a crowd pleaser!! We all had something different, f Butter chicken, vindaloo , chickpea curry and a Korma. The vindaloo was spicy and hot,....just how I like it. My wife said her chickpea curry was a bit spicier than she liked it, but was tasty all the same. Authentic Naan breads sealed the deal, and everything was washed down with a pint of beer. Great location in the heart of Clarke Quay. A bit on the pricy side, but hey......it is Singapore!!!
3
Giving it a 3 star only because the food was very good. The fact that they did not take reservations or guarantee a table considering we were a family with senior citizens (who have health issues) was sad. Even when we were there, the seating provided to us was very uncomfortable and dangerous (if we slightly pushed our chair back to get up, we’d fall down the stairs right behind the chair). The service was also okayish. Would go there again only if I’m already in Clarke Quay and feel like eating Indian (don’t see that happening though)
5
Excellent range of Indian dishes on the menu. Fantastic dining location overlooking Clarke quay. Reasonably priced.
5
We really enjoyed ourselves at this restaurant. We were hoping to get tables with a view but we're unable to do so as the place was busy. Nevertheless, the food and service was exceptional!
4
food was aromatic, ambiance great. we sat outside in the open area & it was lovely seeing life go by. Its a little expensive but most of the places are at clarke quay. You should try it once.
5
We had a few hours to spend in Singapore, went to Clarke quay, just looking for a quick dinner, and was very surprised to find such a good Indian place! There were not a lot of people there, like some of the other spots in this area, but don't let that fool you ! The service was excellent and they were very attentive, and kind in their guidance. We had lamb chops for starter this can definitely be recommended and the butter chicken for main, also excellent. So if you are in the mood for Indian, this would be a good place to go.
5
Excellent crew. Tasty food. Superb fish, chicken options. Spice levels based on your need. I love the choice of breads and veggie options. Don't miss Gulab Jamoon and Kulfi for dessert. Decent wine and beer options too.
3
Went on a Saturday evening and enjoyed it. After a walk on the Clarke Quay I dropped into RAS and got a nice seat next to the river. I could enjoy the view on the active streets of the Quay as well as the river view. I had great and luckily quite spicy chicken, nan and rice as well as Dahl. Very pleasant and if your heart is set on Indian food this restaurant easily makes it to your list
4
You can’t expect to get a cheap meal on the water’s side in Clarke Quay, so there’s no point grumbling that it’s more expensive than your local curry house. That said, we had a really enjoyable meal at RAS last night and would absolutely go back. Food & Service were both terrific, which wins it for me
4
I’ve been here several times before and the food is always first-rate as is the service and great location right on Clarke Quay. We had the Lobster Marsala, Chicken Tandori, Prawn Byriani, Fish Curry, Nan, Popadoms, all was excellent. It’s not cheap but the quality is great. Would we go back, absolutely, every-time I’m in Singapore
3
Great service from the staff but the overall experience was average as the food was below expectations considering all the great reviews. We ordered spicy but got rather bland curries and the menu selection is limited compared to other resteraunts. The resteraunt is in Clarke Quay therefore prices a bit higher than other indian resteraunts outwith. However if you only have a stopover in Singapore and staying around Clarke Quay looking for an Indian, this is an ok choice
4
We fancied an indian as we decided to give this place a try as we had two tired and hungry kids. The non spicy chicken kebab was massive and amazing. The curries madras and jalfrezi were delicious. And the service was spot on. If you enjoy a good curry and some spice eat here!
3
Not very impress with the taste and cooking skills. Overall foods are cooked with too much spices and taste are overwhemed. The vegetables curry are great. Service are good with courteous staff. Pricing are reasonable with not so nice ambience.
3
Good food, but very spicy.On a Saturday their last order is at 2 pm....strange.We expected more people but the place was pretty empt
4
Although in the middle of the popular Clarke Quay and nicely located at the waterfront, this place offers a wide range of very good Indian dishes, served by a friendly group of waiters and at reasonable prices, at least for touristic Singapore standards
3
This was a busy Indian restaurant at Clarke Quay, We ordered Crab Masala, and Tandoori Lobster, both of which were a bit too spicy for our palates, although obviously we realise others would enjoy them
5
 We had a meal there pthe water front . The meals and quantity was ok. However it was supposed to be north indian ( generally mild) it ended tasting more South more hot
5
It is at the Clarke Quay and one of the 2,3 Indian restaurants in the locationWe are vegetarians and after the whole day of travelling Veg food was the need of the hour. The chef didnt failed us and we had delicious dal makhani and tandoori rotiIt has non- veg options also and people were highly appreciate of the food. I found the starters quite tempting ,but for next timeSpeciality - India Curry/dal, starters,Butter Chicken etc. Run by Indians, if you love Indian food this is the placeLocation - Right in heart of Clarke Quay opposite the boat ridePrice- Clarke Quay has most of the eateries which are on the high end and Ras was no exception. 
1
Like I have said in my other reviews, I also go for Indian food even when I am travelling abroadI visited this restaurant after seeing its reviews but it was a disappointment I didn't understand why dal makhni should be spicy or why one would serve onion salad without soaking the onions beforehandI also ordered Pineapple raita which wasn't fresh as expected This restaurant isn't exactly a budget restaurant but a massive disappointment for the price (or taste)Avoidabl
4
Have not been her for a few years but still good. Popular and one of the few long term restaurants on Clarke Quay.Service is friendly and efficientIndoor and outside seating in a modern setting by the riverDid feel rushed and it was not full with a queue outsid
5
We were welcomed by the outdoor area manager. He recommended us exactly what we wanted - perfectly spiced, great food and service. We gave the team a tip, and our manager simply handed our tip money over to his waiter that also looked after us. Classy move that just sums up a great experience. Well done
5
Visited tonight with colleagues that are staying in Singapore with me. We had a cracking meal, everyone enjoyed each course to the upmost degree. Very happy with everything. If I'm back in Clarke Quay, I will be back at RA
5
RAS has great quality Indian fare for those who are dying to have some 'home' food. Located perfectly in the midst of Clarke Quay restaurants, this is a must visit.
4
visited for indian food.. good food, good ambiance for good price in clarke quay Singapore..only indian restaurant in that area
5
It is the only Indian joint in Clark Quay, Singapore and it is in high demand not only from Indians but also from locals and European expats. Good Indian food is served. The kababs are good and the service is quite prompt. They have a open sit out by the river side and also a sitting area in the inside. If you are looking for a good Indian joint then this is the plac
5
Have eaten at Indian restaurants all over the world. This is By far the best indian food by any standards. In and out of India.
4
The Ras kitchen takes the most unfussy ingredients and magically renders them into delicious hearty fare with an unparalleled depth of flavor. Portions are incredibly generous; one entry can easily feed two people (possibly three). Especially high marks go to the Lamb Keema and the Chettinad Chicken
4
The best Indian Restaurant in Singapore. The dinner was really good and the service was perfect. I really enjoyed it
4
Great Indian food and friendly efficient service. We chose to sit adjacent to the river which was a great setting with bumboat tours travelling up and down the river. Seating is also available inside in the air conditioned restaurant. We had Vegetable Samosas and Onion Bhajia entrees and Rogan Gosht and Prawn Masala with basmati rice main courses which were very tasty, excellent quality and good portion size. We had two Tiger beers (pints) and a bottle of sparkling water to go with the great food. The total cost was SGD150 for 2 people which was quite expensive in comparison to other meals we had during our week at Clarke Quay
3
Situated right on Clarke Quay we were given a table on the deck outside. The wait staff were very courteous and friendly. We ordered the Chettinad chicken (we like to try different dishes from the run of the mill butter chicken etc) which did not have much of a description on the menu, so we asked the waiter but all he knew was that it was spicy!We also ordered the taarka dal. The chettinad chicked curry was very good and spicy as predicted but the dal was way too watery. The rice portion we got was quite meagre.We had 1 Tiger beer and a non alcoholic cinderella cocktail and bill was over SGD90. We thought this quite expensive and surmised we were paying for location
4
Set at busy Clarke Quay with seating inside and out along the riverside. Very busy when we went so sat inside which was really nice. Good menu and really good curries. We're able to take away what we didn't finish. Also good wine list. Great service
4
The service,resturant and our choice of dishes was very pleasant and satisfying.The bucket of 5 beers at a cheaper price was a good suprise. The biggest suprise was the final bill at the end.We are obviously spoilt back home with the same great food at a very affordable price.Take a full walle
5
Good Indian food at reasonable price combined with great service! We were initially seated inside the restaurant as the quay side was full but to our surprise we were shifted to the outside within 15 mins as soon as a table became available. Fresh & delicious food, good beverages on a breezy evening !
5
I really loved their Chicken Biryani! :)The ambiance is lovely (restaurant by the river). Food is great. Service is commendable. The restaurant staffs are very polite and friendly
5
We've been going to this restaurant for 5 years and it has never disappointed. The service is great and the food is always fresh and excellent
5
Visited here with a colleague this time.Hasn't changed: friendly helpful staff, great spot (we dined by the river).All courses were really good, the main course with a sauce made from chillies and cashew nuts was superb
3
My husband and I ordered butter chicken, naan and rice which was all lovely, however I don't think it was worth the insane amount we paid for them, especially when there are many other quality Indian restaurants in the area.
2
Service was excellent with the staff helpful throughout. And very helpful with free wifi. It was downhill after that.The food was not bad, we had the chicken tikka (chicken parts, not in a sauce) which was ok, dal tarka which was below average and a the sag paneer which was poor. Beers were over priced like the rest of Clarke Quay.On travels through Asia and Australia, this was the most expensive "average tasting" meal on the voyage. Incredible price tag for what we ate.My previous indian meal was in an excellent restaurant in little India. I guess I thought the Clarke Quay version but be similar. i thought wrong
5
Ras is one of the best Indian food joint I've been to in Singapore. A bit heavy on pocket though, but the taste and service is worth it. Must go.
3
We dropped in for a light supper – reasonably busy – popular with people from Indian sub-continent – seated by river – service attentive from outset – not wanting mains we went for appetisers – onion Baji and vegetable pakoras – not recognisable from home – a lot of batter and little taste – Karli Murg Chicken Tikka – a lot better – well-cooked throughout – hot to the table and well spiced and very much appreciated – again a score draw – judging by its popularity and our chicken this a better restaurant than our pakoras and baji’s would suggest – thank yo
5
Went here for a family dinner earlier this year. Very high standard of food and service, very friendly and helpful staff as well as extensive exterior seating
3
The only Indian restaurant in Clarke Quay, Wish we had more choices in Clarke quay.The Sweet Corn soup, Dal makhni were really tasteful. The food & Service is good but if you check out the prices, Its a total rip off. $1027 for 14 of us. Did we dine in a 7 star ??? We can get better ambience, better food at other places surrounding little India
4
Really good food and service. Don't have the Lamb Rogan Josh - more like soup than anything else. lamb bhuna was excellent.
Staff quite nice. Good location. Good value
5
Had been to this place a couple of times. Cherished the food every time!! It's tough to get authentic Indian taste outside India, but this restaurant provides what you miss when you are abroad. The location is amazing (Clark quay) and the evenings are adorable!!
4
The taste , quality and the quantity was good.. Priced higher... Full course Dinner for an adult will cost you 100$...
5
The location of the restaurant is great. I preferred to sit outside. The restaurant has good variety of delicious Indian dishes. The taste of food was best among vegetarian restaurants in Singapore.
5
Very good Indian restaurant with very friendly staff. Located at Boat Quay is also really nice. Portions are big and prices are reasonable. Have been there several times and will return..
4
We were looking for a curry and came across Gas, the food is excellent we had a vegetarian,chicken and lamb curries with a range of heat. All dishes were excellent and very tasty. The restaurant is next to the river at Clarke quay and this creates a lovely atmosphere
4
We had a great meal at Ras though it was a bit pricey- however, eat at Clarke Quay and expensive is really the norm.Food was wonderful. We had butter chicken, aloo gobi, saffron rice & garlic naan. The chicken was tasty & had a little bit of heat, the aloo gobi was just right and the garlic naan was garlicky and light!!We had a jug of beer with the food and the whole experience was great.If you are in Clarke Quay & fancy an Indian meal, then I recommend Ras, just watch your pennies!
5
We initially dined outside with views of the river however due to a storm we had to move inside. Both areas were most comfortable and the location is excellent. The staff were friendly and efficient. The food was outstanding, both the appetisers and main courses and the flavours and quantities were excellent. The prices are high, but they are the norm for restaurants in the Clarke Quay and similar areas. The toilets are round the corner, but this applies to most if not all restaurants along the Clarke Quay riverside. An excellent place to dine if you like quality Indian food
4
It's located in the midst of the bustle of Clark quay on the river side. The service was good but rushed as this is a very busy part of the city restaurant wise. The starter and main for both of us was very good and I agree with another writer that good Indian food is hard to find. So good food but expensive and unlike Chinatown there are few drinks deals so beers will be expensive. With two starters mains one beer and a bottle of wine, ninety pounds! The last frustration was that once settled and ordered I discovered that the loos were out of the door and round the corner
4
The restaurant is sandwiched between two big restaurants, and if you are not observant, you would have walked past it. Due to the hot weather, we decided to take the table inside the restaurant rather than outside. Services were impeccable, and the food was delicious. I like that the tandoori chicken was succulent and flavorful. The reason why I couldn't give it a perfect score was the lack of toilet within the premise. It took the mood off that we had to walk 1-2 minutes from the restaurant to the toilets in Clarke Quay (which are usually dirty and crowded from evening time onwards).
4
Situated along the river at Clarke Quay opposite The Central, RAS is a nice Indian diner with delicious food. Attentive staff, to. My overseas visitor and I had a pleasant experience.
4
Located right on river singapore. Ras provides a amazing view of the river with very good Indian food. It's a must visit for every Indian food lover.
5
Had one of the best Indian meals we've had. Service could not be faulted. Air conditioned inside made it nice and comfortable as it was a hot evening. The lamb was cooked to perfection.
5
Loved it. Great tasting food that we all loved
Best vindaloo I have had in years
Recommended to all.
5
One of the best Indian meals my wife and I have had in years!
The staff, setting, and service were all really good.
The food exceptional; I had the house speciality the sauce is made from cashew nuts and green chillies, it was delicious.
4
The food here is pretty good, the onion bahji for started was massive and the vege samosas were sizeable too. Service was excellent but when we asked for the loo, we were directed round the corner to the public ones. Fine for the boys, not so much the girl
5
Indians crave for indian food which ever part of the world they are. This restaurant per me is bit different as it had not only the standard indian specialities but the south-indian preparations of standard food. I have had indian food in Delhi(where i grew up) , london, Canada where one gets good indian food..but this was the best i ever had. rich taste not the typical creamy stuff. You could taste the different masalas in the Curry. The service was excellent and attentive. We were there in the evening so the ambience around with boats and bridges lighted up was really nice. Value and quality for money. I would only increase the size of Naan for the money paid. highly recommended for indians and foreigners alike. We were a mix of foreigners and indians and both liked the food equally. We sat outside so I cannot comment on the ambiance inside
4
Really enjoyed the food, rogan gosht, garlic naan, cucumber raita. We ordered one main dish between the two of us and that was sufficient. Prices in Singapore are not cheap but the quality was good and hey, we were on holiday! Located on Clarke Quay, would have been nice to sit outside but all those seats were taken
3
It is an average place food wise. Possibly does not try very hard to do justice to the name -essence of India I had only Tandoori food The cauliflower was good but the pepper chicken lacked the finesse Curries which they serve look richI am sure you can find better places to eat Indian food in Singapore
4
Some dishes like the chicken tikka were excellent. The garlic naan ok too. Maybe half of customers were indians, so it should be a good sign. Nevertheless we found the fish inside the fish masala was quite bland. The restaurant is very well located for the river view, but quite expensive as well, so only worth the premium if you can get a table by the river. Service was efficient and they did adapt correctly the spicyness to our liking
3
Located on Clarke quay, this restaurant has attentive staff and good quality, tasty food. We found all the dishes a little more spicy than we were used to vs UK and the portions were huge.
5
best curry ever on the marina
can sit inside air conditioned or at the waters edge with fans
best curry ever service excellent expensive but worth it
5
Fabulous curries ! Couldn't fault the food. Service with a smile. One black mark would be the price but then it's Clarke's Quay and should be expected.
4
Wonderful preparations at a great location . The food cost approx INR 6000/- for a meal of 4 adults .
The food was very tasty and service was prompt.
Definitely must try .
4
Enjoyed a lovely meal at this restaurant at Clarke quay.
Service good. A bit expensive but all food seems to be expensive in Singapore .
4
Parents had food at this good Indian Restaurant, next to the lake at Clarke Quey. Enjoyed the paneer tikka and the other Indian Delicacies. While others start and manage their restaurant entire day, they start evening by 7; which was ok.
4
The food and service (especially Ravi) were exceptional. We chose the lamb curry (Kadai Gosht) and the Dal Tadka and both were extremely tasty. The wine, by Singapore prices, was reasonably priced and good quality. The location is very pleasant and whilst you pay a premium for it, the overall experience is much better value for money than say Boat Quay
4
We ordered for Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Nan, the taste was so amazing that I can still feel it. Excellent service and amazing food. Though its a bit expensive @ SD 65 for 2 people when we ordered fruit punch, Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan
5
Really as the title you can find the real taste of Indian food.I had mutton chops here really yummy.Chicken biryani also superb.Serving is good and i found telugu servant in that hotel.Food is superb but the cost seems to be little bit high because of riverside might be
3
Been there for a lunch. Located at a fantastic location - riverside clarke. An average indian restaurant. Food quality was Ok not too great. Service was pathetic.Being located in calrke quay, price is also charged accordingly. For a dal makhni and 2 lacha paratha, i paid around SGD 38 and wasnt worth with the kinda service provided and average food quality. Not worth to visit second time unless you around clarke riverside and just want to have indian food
4
Authentic taste, fast service but a bit expensive. The rates are par with any 5 star hotels where as ambiance does not support the rates charged. Nevertheless, very good Indian food.
3
Had a lovely indian spread and nice choice for Vegetarians as well. Tried the food at the other outlet of Ras bites in changi.
A little pricier but feel its worth the spend.
Food - 3.5
Service - 3
Overall - 3.5
5
I would visit Ras anytime I miss Indian food. Great location by the river-side and delicious food. Great choice for vegetarians. Don't miss the biryani and pulav.
3
The food here is good but it is far too expensive, even for Singapore. Clarke Quay is known to be pricey, but this place is not worth the hugely inflated prices.
For a great curry head to Little India at Outram MRT.
4
Ideal for Dinner .Perhaps the best Naan(a type of Indian Tandoori Bread) you can get in Singapore is at Ras.The stewards are well trained and well mannered and the food is genuinely good.The place is pricey but so is all restaurants in Clarke Quay,I will recommend this place as a must for anyone wanting Indian food in Singapore with a decent ambience
3
This restaurant is at Clarke Quay and while the food was good, we felt it was expensive; however, it is on the side of the river which puts the price up! We chose to eat inside because it was so hot out, but this proved to be a poor decision because the air-conditioning and the 'musak' were so loud, both were irritating
3
If you're a frequent Indian traveller to Asia, there might be a time beyond a point you miss Indian Food. I had high expectations when i got here, other than the prawns which were fantastic, the typical Indian Daal and food was disappointing. The service slow 7 slightly inattentive. Indian travelers only increase every year i am sure they can do better
3
Have a nice evening sitting outdoors watching the people,stroll by. Nice setting and good service. The food we ordered was good Indian fare. While I can take most spice and madras is my favorite, this one was so spicy, I could not finish it. Next time I am in Singapore I'll find one a little less expensive
3
Just finished a meal here. Food was decent bordering good. Atmosphere was good, on the river front, service was fast and good. Prices, well, here I lost it! 7 dollars for Nan bread? Really?Dollar for value ratio is very low. Fancy Indian food? Go to little India, better food much better prices
4
One of the many bustling restaurants on the Clarke Quay complex. Overall we enjoyed the food; some nice flavours in the curry and meats that we ate. Breads were also good, including very buttery butter naan. Prices probably a little high but this is Clarke Quay, they will be on the top side.
4
A very popular dining precinct, very busy, friendly service , food was tasty and well presented. Slightly on the expensive side for some dishes, however an enjoyable evening of dining
5
The food out here is awesome, one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. To add to it, the view- on the riverside adds to the perfect dining experience. Definitely value for money!
4
A very good Indian food option at clarke quay. The quantity and the quality of the food is good, service is great. Must try dal makhani and chicken tikka masala.
5
Went to Ras again this evening and the food was excellent. The Chicken Samosas and Lamb Vindaloo were great. I'll definitely be back again soon.
4
Visited this place after spending the day at the Universal Studios. The lively atmosphere in Clarke Quay adds to the overall charm of this place. This is a fine dine option with not too over-the-top prices, esp at Clarke Quay.
4
On the river at Clarke Quay. We were greeted with dips and Pappadums. We ordered beers, chicken tikka masala, veg curry, lamb Korma and plain rice. The food came quickly and was very tasty and copious. Bill was 120 as.
3
The restaurant is placed in a tourist area, so the price is quite inflated. The food itself was delicious. However we ordered one Chicken Tikka which was raw inside, NOT OK! Especially for this price level! The service was really good and appreciated.No more than 3 in rating because of its raw chicken and we didnt get anything as an excuse.
5
We recently visited Singapore and are so happy we found RAS The Essence of India. We had dinner at the restaurant on a busy evening in Clarke Quay. The restaurant has a river-side section, which is a great if you want to people watch while dining. We enjoyed great starters of poppadum and pickles and dips. We were then served our main courses. Excellent, simply excellent. Probably the very best Tandoori Mixed Grill ever
4
Our order of Paneer and Dal was quite well made and came to us on time and was hot.The taste of food would take you back to some places in india and does deliver on it's name as being the essence of india.The price is quite at par with the neighbouring places, the recommendation is to sit out in the open as a preference and the inside are a bit stuffy.Our visit to RAS was especially memorable cause of the special treatment doled out to my 5 year old in terms of colourful cutlery and good food
5
We were really in the mood for an Indian meal and struggled to find somewhere and eventually found RAS and as it was late decided to eat there. It was a good decision, the staff were quick, courteous and helpful and food had bags of flavour and heat. Probably the best Indian meal we have eaten in Singapore and definitely worth a visit.
5
RAS essence of india is beautifully located at clark quay directly at singapore river.
the food was great and the portions were big. next time i would not take starter, naan and main course...
but it tasted great!!!
5
Excellent food. Sit outside by the river. A bit on the expensive side but the food was worth it. A better curry than we get in London.
4
Very good, well-cooked fare.
North Indian food doesnt get more authentic than this ! They alos stock Indian beer for those that are particular.
Friendly wait staff adds to the experience...but sit outside.
5
Without doubt for several years the best Indian restaurant in Singapore.
Everything we order is delicious.
5
I had been here for 2nd time almost after a year
I remember the taste of Lam chops which I had last year and this year seek kabab
Both this Items are awesome everyone should try
3
Rather average. We were a couple and ate inside, as they seemed to want to save the better tables outside for larger parties. The food was OK, with a reasonable menu, but nothing memorable.
4
This was a great find. The food is actually really nice and well cooked. And its in the heart of a really vibrant area. Clarke Quay has a lot of restaurants and bars.I booked this place online and had no issues. The waiters are helpful and friendly althouth at times a little overrun. We sat outside which is the better option if you want a bit of atmosphere when eating.The one drawback is the prices. But bearing in mind the location and the actual food it is worth it

Saw this Indian restaurant on Clarke Quay while strolling there at night with kids and couldnt resist having a quick bite. Since it was past 10.30 pm and it was almost closing time, the person on duty still managed to get our order of samosas quickly even though he expressed his inability to take order for food. But the icing on the cake was the service with a smile even though the order was only a plate of samosa, which arrived with chutney and papad and proper table laid out. The Samosa was expensive but the whole experience of dining under the stars, near the waterside with great service really made our day

What a night! Capped off by a really special meal at RAS. myself and my wife both feel that it was one of the best meals from our trip. Truly superb flavors and chicken cooked perfectly in the tandoor. The atmosphere of the venue is very special especially during the Friday night we went! Would go again in a heartbeat
5
We love Indian food and only went to RAS because of the great reviews on TA.We were not disappointed. Everything about our whole ding experience was "top Notch". Our meal was one of the best Indian meals we have ever had ( and we have had lots and lots), The service was unbelievable even though every table was occupied and it was very busy. We can gladly recommend RAS, and we will return on our next Singapore trip. Great stuff
4
Great food, well prepared and served by friendly and efficient staff. Nice riverside setting in bustling Clarke Quay adds to the atmosphere. Big portions, so be careful not to over-order. Jugs of cold Tiger help to keep cool.
4
This restaurant offers good Indian food - probably the only Indian restaurant in Clarke quay. The service was great. Please note that they close the restaurant at around 10.30pm.
4
Great service and very tasty Indian food at Clark Quay would recommend. Helpful staff even suggested we should order less food!
4
Good service and tasty/authentic Indian food but you pay for the location..... Tikka chicken and the green chicken were delicious...
4
It is located in Clarke quay. The food was proper North Indian - but very expensive! Enjoyed the meal.
5
Went there looking for good indian food after a week away from India...and RAS really made us feel at our home country...Amazing food,Gr8 flavours.We ordered the dhaniya chicken and mutton biryani (both were really flavourful)...I highly recommend the biryani..also the naan bread and lachcha paratha perfectly added to the meal along with a jal jeera (which was a bit too sweet).Though it's a expensive place at Clarke Quay..we had a bill of $98 for this order. ..but when you get a perfect pallet..if don't mind paying for the location and the amazing foodâ˜
4
Seven of us went there for dinner. The food was amazing. We ordered few veg and non-veg starters - and everything was tasty. Main course included paneer, fish, chicken, biryani, butter nans. Everything was just perfect. Service time is reasonable and staff is very friendly.As far as my experience goes, I found this place as one of the best in the world for tasty Indian food. However, its Singapore so everything is pricey and this place is no different. It's overtly pricey to a point it might turn off some people from returning.If you want to enjoy fine dining at a great location, try this one out
4
We circled all the restaurants in Clarke Quay and finally settled for Indian. The food is very tasty and the service was excellent. The food did not take long to come out either. Try and book a table by the river for a lovely romantic setting. If you love your Indian food then you will not be disappointed..
4
Visited with an Indian colleague and we had Fish and Chicken type Tandoori starters which were excellent. For main we had a veg curry and daal with Roti - again superb.Would go again for sure - best to sit outside which is what we did
3
But of course it's Clarke Quay. So you pay for the location. Food was good, service was under par for the price (on par with Little India restaurants), although the restaurant wasn't that busy. The toilets are borderline criminal, and the kitchen, of which I got a glimpse, looked quite dirty
4
The restaurant is well located and the choice of Indian food is good. The ambience is well suited for casual business meetings or for get together a in small groups.
Surely recommend people to try the food here. 👍👍
5
great can`t speak highly enough about this place great food good
choice of food well cooked service perfect food bought out at correct time
4
Good Indian food, good service, although a bit on the pricey side.
However, the restaurant owners should really look into providing a decent toilet - the single toilet at the premises is absolutely disgusting and has no place in the 21st century.
5
I had two meals during my stay in Singapore in Ras and the location of the restaurant and food quality was excellent . I had Indian Vegetarian and Non vegetarian meal which was served well in time with very good taste .
5
This place has never failed to disappoint me .: it's outstanding .. The service was so attentive and warm and the food just left me feeling warm inside as it was so delicious !!! Completely worth the experience and price ! A must visit !
4
Had dinner here on our visit to Clarke Quay. Location is nice, you can eat either in a restaurant or right next to river. Food was good and service was good as well, it was little crowded though, probably due to weekend. I found food little expensive.
4
Ras is located in an excellent location in Clarke Quay and has options for seating along the river or inside the restaurant. We ordered palak paneer, vegetable biryani, dal makhni, kadhai paneer and roomali rotis. The food was authentic Indian and special mention for the palak paneer. However, the icing on the cake was their roomali rotis - incredibly soft, excellent!It is slightly expensive by even Singapore standards but the food is good
4
The restaurant offers both indoors as well as outdoor sitting - next to the river. The clarke quay offers beautiful setting and i would recommend that for the evening dinner. The service is very good and the quality of food is pretty good as well. The portion size is decent and the choice in menu are quite good
5
Table for four people, we had delicious chicken tikka, tikka masala and another dish whose name I forgot. It was chicken in a yellow sauce with a very tasty aroma of cardamon. I recommend the restaurant. We will go there again for our last dinner in this marvellous city
4
location. location, location, on the river edge, we had beautiful seats and the service was sensational.the food was beautiful and classic Indian, they treated our family with 2 kids really well, we were not hurried at all.my only issues was kids drinks, $12 each for pretend cocktail, surely kids should get cool drinks free, you do not have to slug kids that much. The costs of the kids drinks stopped us getting sweets and extra rice, that is what happens when you get greedy with drink prices, it would be excellent but for that glaring fault.
4
The food, service and setting were excellent but prices are above average for Singapore. My teenagers were able to appreciate the quality of the food, but if your don't than you better go to a more cost effective food court.
3
did not have time to see shops in full. but they all looked better than our last trip. will go here next trip
4
The meal was great and the service first class. We had the fish masala and rogan gosht lamb curry. Both were really nice and the taste was perfect. Spicy but washed down with Tiger beer it was perfect!
4
Indian Food at River Side...amazing Clarke Quay location.... Feels delighted... nice food...nice experience...various dishes and options....Rides nearby as well..... Surely Try and visit once....
4
Tasty and reasonably priced food, by singapore restaurant standards. Service was good. Right on the water. Clarke quay is a good location for a night out.
5
Great and authentic Indian food with lots of choice for vegetarians.
Try the okra and the eggplant. The Dahl is awesome too.
Happy hour beer jugs and good service finish off a delightful restaurant. Will be back.

Recently we went to this restaurant outlet in Clark quay for dinner with family. We had read a lot of positive reviews and therefore went with expectations of quality food and authentic taste. We ordered Non Veg platter which was good. However the qty was less especially for the prices they charge. Next was mocktails which were sugary syrup in water and actually quite bad. The serving staff did try to attempt to improve the taste but was quite futile.For main course we ordered butter chicken which was having a very sweet curry. Now we have eaten original butter chicken in India and therefore can really tell the difference. Dal makhani was just some plain dal. Nothing even remotely close to the original. The roti and naan are over priced and not soft, instead are quite chewy and dry.The service is good but I would place a big weightage on food taste where this restaurant is really lacking. And.. not ti mention the high prices. A simple meal set us back by SGD 190.Given a choice I would not return back to this restaurant
4
We used TripAdvisor on our mobile to pick a place in Clarke Quay. I was a bit pessimistic to have Indian food in the tourist zone when Little India is just a few dollars cab ride away. I was pleasantly surprised. The food was extremely good! We had the mixed grill plate (meat), Palak Paneer, and a shrimp rice dish (name I cannot recall). We also had cheese naan and a garlic naan. The lime juice was FRESH and not overly sweetened, highly recommended. The Palak Paneer was just out of this world, best I ever had.... Only negative was the price. Meat dish and shrimp rice were each over $34 and Palak Paneer was around $20. Naan was $10 each and juice was $8/small glass. In this area, I guess this is status quo, but definitely a lot of $ for the portions received
4
Great location in Clarke Quay. The food was better than the location would deem necessary. The cocktails (yes, we were miserably unoriginal and had the Singapore Sling) were delicious and the curries nice and spicy. The portions were generous and the service was attentive. As soon as a table near the water became available, the waiter moved us over without hesitation. The three of us through toy enjoyed our meals and would recommend this restaurant
5
Great place for Indian Food at a perfect location. You can dine in or outdoors and all is freshly prepared. Lamp is recommended, any dish that is. Also the fish from the Tandoor is delicious.Price is more that reasonable for the quality you get. Reservation is a must in weekend
4
A very nice indian restaurant with a terrasse next to the water.
The food was good, we tried a couple of dishes and all were excellent.
Classics like butter chicken or kormas are a little more spicy than their UK counterpart, but still very enjoyable.
4
RAS is my 12 year old daughter's choice restaurant at Clarke Quay. While generally a bit touristy, RAS food is pretty authentic. They have a lunch special which is good value and very tasty.
5
The reviews are correct - this is great. Book if you want to sit waterside as it gets very busy. The Chicken Tandoori was delicious with a subtle heat and a wonderful flavour.
4
My wife and I both thoroughly enjoyed the food and being able to view the many coloured lights of the river. The service was prompt attentive. Would recommend a visit by anyone who enjoys Indian food.
5
This place is fantastic, always a warm welcome and the food is out of this world. Tandoori prawns are a must, sauces are very tasty and you have the beautiful views on the outside terrace. Can't recommend enough.
4
Pros:
1. Good food. Authentic Indian.
2. Very good location within Clarke Quay. We got seats right beside the river.
Cons:
1. Expensive.
2. Too much waiting time for the riverside seats.
3. Didn't like the Jaljeera also.
5
Food and views ( seat outside by the river) are excellent.
Service is very slow......and you need to be smart during the order process, they will try to up-sell you items.
Overall pricey but what is not in Singapore
4
Very pleasant outdoor dining on the busy Clarke Quay strip along the Singapore River. Three different curries were seriously tasty and nicely presented. Good range of drinks available. Service was quick and pleasant. Better than many Indian restaurants.
3
Visited the place with few friends who were missing Indian food and I quite liked the ambience and food quality. Portion sizes were really big, too big for an average person and food is extremely expensive. A good Indian restaurant if you are in a mood of fine dining, do not expect a budget meal!
5
Well , we were looking for restaurant set in romantic corner.....with a table for two... we ended up in crowded clarke quay ....we booked a table for two ...although we arrived couple of minutes delayed they held the reservation...food was just splendid....we ended up eating garlic naan bread because the flavour was tantalizing...the mains were really good.overall great ambience great food and timely service
4
I can highly recommend the spicy lamb - very tender and well seasoned dish. And you can ask for extra spices. Worth visiting if you love Indian food!
4
Good food with Indian spices . little over priced IMO but worth if you're craving for Indian food.. Green chutney was the best thing they have there
4
Located on the Singapore river we enjoyed our meal. With the assistance of the waiter we had a nice meal. Good food. Good service.
4
This is the Indian restaurant to eat at! Its at Clarks Quay, the happening place. Well this restaurant is always busy, but once you get a table (outside), you just have to sit back and enjoy the food. You are served authentic indian food, with a very good service level. The Chicken tikka is great, so are the currys and the naans! The price is on the high side, but i guess its worth, compared to restaurants in Little India! Go for it
5
Clarke Quay is always bustling with life and people and this restaurant was no exception. Me and my work colleague went here for a curry and it did not disappoint. We had the mixed tandoor grill and one of their specialty curries and it is safe to say we were not left disappoint. I would definitely recommend the cheese nan as well
4
Went with a few friends and we sat outdoors, which was nice and breezy. The buffet menu has a few options, $50++, $60++, or $70++. We took the cheapest option, with no prawns. The pappadums were crispy but a tad salty. Still enjoyable. The basmati rice is so fragrant and fluffy I took a few servings! Absolutely delicious with the lamb curry and chicken curry. Palak paner (cottage cheese cubes in spinach) was warm and melted in my mouth, yummy!!I must compliment Ras on the impeccable service. Very attentive and accommodating. You might want to sit indoors if u prefer airconditioned dining. With a bottle of wine, bill came up to $80 each, which I felt was reasonable. We were all absolutely stuffed and happy
5
We were seated outside on a very busy night in late December. The staff were exceptionally friendly, and the food was really delicious. The dishes had a nice amount of spice, and the beers went down very well as we sat in the nice evening air. The restaurant was very busy, which is a great indication of the quality of the food, but they were very accomodating and we never felt lost in the fray
5
We visited this restaurant for an Indian dineer and were over satisfied with some items even better than themselves in India probably. The Biryani was superb and so was the fish amritsari and butter chicken. Even the delicios gulab jamun and kulfi are worth a try. The super delicious food, great ambience, nice location and suitable timings compelled us to re-viist next day for lunch
4
Tucked away amidst many of the pubs and restaurants along the river walk in Ckarke Quay is Ras. The food served here was quite delicious albeit the service was a bit on the slower side. The restaurant is quite crammed and if you want to go for a romantic dinner then this is not the right place since there is a lot of hustle and bustle. I only tasted the vegetarian dishes since I am a vegetarian but the non-veg dishes such as the biriyani and curries were hot sellers. They also serve papad and three chutneys as a complimentary.
4
Having only eaten Indian food at home in Australia, it was great to try some more authentic Indian cuisine. It was brilliant. The flavours and spiciness was just as I would expect from authentic Indian food. Washed down with a couple of Kingfishers made the evening. Service was great too although a little rushed
4
Located ideally in one of the best locations in Singapore, it is a sensible option for indian food in Singapore. Bit costly, it is worth of trying at least once.
3
A good indian cuisine restaurant in the busy clarke quay. Good menu selection, not the best indian food one ll find in singapore. Go here if u r craving for spicy indian food! Service can be slow when busy.
4
A really good indian restaurant in Clarke Quay, definitely worth a visit :) as with its neighbouring restaurants, it has a nice view over the river, and although it gets busy, service is quite fast!
4
The Indian Curry was delicous, Service very good....try safran rice and garlic nan....You will love it...we went there even a second time.
3
Good to see Indian restaurant in Clarke quay but food is very expensive.it has both options for sitting whether in A.C or open.
4
good indian food, good portion size. Sitting arrangement can be better. You can sit outside but not in summers and incidentally its summer 12 months of the year in Singapore.A bit expensive but for clark quay i think its acceptable. Friendly staff.
5
Great quality of food , and feels like heyyy i am in india after having food ....
Very good food and service too .
Great job , Keep it up
5
As this restaurant is just in the middle of an area of dozens of others of all kinds why chose it?Reason number one it is relatively quiet no loud music blaring so you actually have a conversation.Readon number two is very spicy and good indian food with a good choice which comes in fast but not too fast and even the spicy variants are tasty and the different taste come out very well. Actually one of the best chickens I ever had tasty and juicy.The service is fast and attentive. One thing though forget about the (good and extensive bue expensive) wine list india blue beer is a perfect companio
5
Lying by the water at the thriving Clarke Quay, we found this restaurant and decided to give it a try. Goanese Prawns were delicious as well as the curries. Service was fast, attentive and nice. The only issue: price! Dinner for 2 with beers was 140SGP. Nonetheless I don't think it's possible to get something much cheaper in the area
3
In our seven days stay we came across this Restaurant. This is located on Clerk Quay and is easily accessible by MRT. In beautiful and colorful environment of Clerk quay and after eating other continents food for 3-4 days we had craving of our very own food so we decided to go there. We did not get space to sit outside, on the riverside so we choose to sit inside, the ambience there was cozy. We liked the food but found it a little pricey. Of course you are paying for a spot so better wait and sit outside. The seating area inside is not that big so when someone ordered sizzlers or sizzling browny (I donâ€™t know what exactly it was) smoke made us feel suffocating. Dining tables were sticky. There were stains on the wash basin and glass /wall behind it. MRT washrooms were better than their small washroom
5
Guys you need to be here to have his awesome taste of Indian food.
Try out for tandoor prawns and lam chops one of the best things to have in there
4
Service is good. We had decent meal with beriani, chicken korma, vege masala and garlic nan bread. Not the best indian food i've tasted but not a dissapointment also.
Price a bit over the top since it is located at touristy area of clarke quay.
4
One of the best Indian food in Singapore. The location is very nice as well. The only thing that there prices are very high. But it's expected since u r in Singapore.
2
We were looking for good Indian food but the taste was not so great here. The ambience is very good but the food not at all close to authentic Indian food.
4
I tried this restaurant first time as was walking through the Clarke Quey area and saw this restaurant, the ambient is nice as I had the outdoor seating with my family. Ordered the food. Service is ok and acceptable. However the chicken I ordered, came out a bit sweet which does not go with North Indian food taste. The other dish was ok. In general, it's a nice place but you gave to insist the waiters to make sure about the taste.the prices are slightly on the higher side but that's Singapore
5
It's always with a real pleasure that we eat in this restaurant. Of course, it's located in the middle of the tourist pathways of SIN, squeezed between two other terrace of restaurants. But it is too a location really easy to reach: you don't have to go far in the streets of the town. The food is tasty, delicious with the natural indian flavour. Close your eyes and believe a few moment that you are in a restaurant in Delhi, Jaipur or....somewhere else in the indian continent. Tha ambiance and the service are perfect without exces
5
When in Singapore you must have an Indian meal and where else but on the banks of Clark Quay, location is sensational overlooking the quay , the surroundings modern clean and the vibe in the area alive. The food was sensational, tasty and value for money. I would highly recommend eating here as you will leave satisfied and with a true taste of Indian food
4
Good ambience and well located in tourist visited place in Singapore. The food was really good, but can go better. This is Singapore!...with a large indian community!..so can improve, having tasted variety of Indian food....The dal curry was the best of what we ordered. Veg and non-veg options available and be ready to pay a bit of a price. On a hot day, go inside rather than outside seating. You will enjoy the food and not sweat it out
4
My parents were visiting Singapore and had never been to Clarke Quay, so I suggested we go there for dinner. After walking around for a bit, we decided upon Indian Food and got seated inside RAS The Essence of India (my father insisted on air-conditioning, so we passed on riverside seating).What we liked:- Quick service - got drinks and orders out of the way very quickly, almost as soon as we got seated- Delicious food - mixed grilled meats, grilled vegetables, chicken tikka masala, saffron rice and some spicy eggplant dish…. all delicious with just the right amount of heat!- Beautiful interior decor - always adds to the ambianceWhat could have made it better:- Well… can’t really do to much about the price. It’s Clarke Quay after all. We spent about >SGD250 for food and wine for five people.Overall, a great family dining experience
5
Although this resturant is a tourist trap in the quay, which is reflected in the price it is clearly the best Indian around. We returned for a second time as the food was that good. The location is amazing, right in the water front. The service is second to none.The portion sizes are quite big so if you have a starter you may want to consider sharing a curry for your main course. Our bill came to around 100$, we just had mains, sides and drinks. I would highly recommend this place if you are wanting to dine on the riverside
5
We ate here on our first night in singapore and werent disapointed, when we arrived it was so busy but they still made space for us, the food and ambience was very good and gutted we didnt go back before we left
5
A lovely place to have good Indian food at Clarks Quay. The food is good with sumptuous portions. Very good service and good Indian music to accompany!
5
Located in Clarke Quay you expect to perhaps pay a little more. We were offered a table overlooking the river which was lovely & relaxing, fans immediately moved to help cool us down as it was a very warm evening. Food was delicious & our waiter very helpful & attentive. Due to the advice of our waiter (R. Srinivasan, thank you you were amazing) we ordered just the right amount of food & with the right amount of spices. My teenagers can be quite fussy eaters but everything was as he explained. He was such a pleasant young man who provided amazing service which helped to make this evening very memorable. This is one of the reasons I am giving this restaurant such a high rating
4
A pleasent dining experience with good service and good indian food. The area is a bit of a tourist trap and so prices are higher then other less tiuristy areas. That said we had an enjoyable evening with friendly service and good food. Couple of chicken tika masalas, buttered chicken, lamb buhna, and some really tasty tandori lamb and prawn starters plus nan and a few beers for 6 of us ( 2 kids) came in at $350 approx.
3
I went there for dinner with a colleague and was unimpressed if not disappointed with the food. We ordered the masala aloo dish (having specifically asked the server if it was akin to a Dum Aloo) and were told it wasn't...yet when it came the dish was full of cashews, raisins and cherry's in it (no diff then a Kashmiri version of this dish)...the Dal Tadka was better, however the Veg Jal Freezi was bland and unappealing. The breads were the ok and so was the Ras Malai...would surely not go back here given several far better choices both in terms of quality of food and price
1
I have been a Ras fan for as many years as I have known Ras. But today was a pathetic and worst of all experience. I had clearly stated my food preference during booking and also stated the reason of going to Ras. Infact the restaurant Manager Mr Vivek called me to confirm the booking. Things were ok till we starters were served. For main course I asked for the dishes that serve my diet preference. For appetizers we ordered Salted Lassi - it was so stale that I can smell fermentation in it. We asked for a replacement and got a fresh nice lassi.Then we asked as per our diet preference, I was told by the waiters and Mr Vivek himself of Paneer makhanwala will be non spicy and jain. We ordered that. For regular main course we ordered Marchi Ka Salan. Paneer Makhanwala was very spicy and had to be returned and substituted by aloo jeera. Mirchi Ka salan had stale and smelly ingredients and we asked for spicy kolhapuri in exchange. While aloo jeera was edible, kholapuri was just smelling of chillies. There was no masala, it was red chillies all the way. When I confronted Vivek - he never even apologized and told that we are problem creators and no other customers have any food problem. But he forgot that I had mentioned diet preference in my reservation email which was not catered for. In all I paid $197 for this third grade stuff. I have vowed never ever to go to Ras as they spoiled birthday celebration of my 2 year old kid. Service sucks and do does the staff
5
As we sat outside we had an excellent view of the waters. Hence it is one of the best places to have a cool dinner.The food was very tasty and very indian. The service too was quite fast. The staff was very helpful and deserve a pat
4
we travelled in india before and we try sometimes to find again the same flavours and ambiance. It is the perfect case in this restaurant. Of course if you are looking for the" last hip design" try to found an other but if you want to find the real india (clean) don't skip. The menu is large and the meal is really tasty and authentic. Perfect choice in Singapore
4
Located at Clarke Quay. Good selection of Indian food. The prawns and chicken biryani was good as advised by my friends family who had it. Being vegetarians we enjoyed the Jalfrezi. The next day, we took the set lunch menu and was good too. Both days we spent about 112 Sing dollar for 6 people. Recommended for people looking for Indian food at reasonable costs at a happening location
4
Set in the buy Clarke Quay this restaurant is as you would expect far more expensive than the curry houses in Little India, however you are understandably paying for the prime location.There is seating outside or in the pleasant air conditioned restaurant. I opted to eat inside, the service was friendly without being over the top, the menu wasn't the most exciting that I have ever seen but the food was good, service was slick and if you want a decent reliable Indian restaurant then you cant really go wrong here
3
Being vegetarian. this place was a bliss for us. Though its not complete vegetarian restaurant but in Singapore searching for Indian food in some location becomes little tough. Quality and taste was good.
3
Average Food
Above Average Bill
Above Average outdoor seating
Above Average Staff
Very average food...have had much much better food in an Indian restaurant.... Would not go again......
5
Nice location by the river side. A must to get an outside table. Excellent food if you like Indian tasty food. Portions are large. A mango lassie needed to cool off afterwards.
4
Dined solo. Very quick service and helpful staff. Food was of a high quality both the quality of the meat and fish and the cooking. Perhaps a little pricey for a restaurant of this type
5
Coming from India, you dont expect much out of a indian restaurant in a foreign location. However, food at RAS was authentically Indian. Loved the chicken tikka masala & rogan gosh. The price was steep. but totally worth it considering the location, Clark Quay!
4
Normally indian food is a value option for college students and freelance writers. Even as you move upscale it tends to remain a better value than other cuisines. Not so with Ras, I'm afraid. This is very good food on prime real estate but the pricing is out of whack and alters the value equation to the point where I'm not sure I want to go back there again. If you must have Indian and you don't want to take a chance and you are a tourist sticking to the center it's a decent choice. But you'll end up feeling you overpaid even as you pay your compliments to the che
5
Dining at Ras was by accident, but what a pleasant surprise. Had our best indian/pakistan food experience ever at Ras in Singapore. We have travelled to USA, UK, Europe, Asia but this was with no doubt the best indian food we have ever had. Great service and simply delicious food
5
We visit Ras every time we come to Singapore and it's one of the few places we are yet to have a bad experience.The food is authentic and so yummy. Service is good and it's nice to sit outside with a table overlooking the quay.Highly recommend
4
By walking along Clake Quay, I came across this Indian restaurant. I had a look to the menu, I liked the placed and everything seemed to be very clean. I chose a table on the riverside and I fully enjoyed my dinner which I think ( not being an expert anyway ) that it was authentic Indian food. I especially loved the bread and the lamb. The price was not cheap but justified for a vibrant location like that. I found all the staff very nice, professional and polite. When I am back to Singapore I will remember about this restaurant
5
My partner and I visited RAS on 11 December 2013. We received a very warm welcome and the service was exceptional throughout. The meal was superb and although this restaurant is more expensive than those found in Little India they are poles apart. Clarke Quay is a must with it's vibrant multi-cultural revellers, fountains and international cuisines - it must not be missed
5
Having eat in various Indian restaurants (outside of India) I must say this has to be one of the best yet! truly recommend it.
4
This is a great place to go with a big group and share all the yummy dishes. Service was great and the food was outstanding. Not a great value but great fun.
5
I visit Singapore at least once a year and ALWAYS enjoy having dinner here. The location is beautiful and the food exceptional. I have travelled a lot and by far to date this is my favourite Indian restaurant.
4
Pros:
Food was excellent.
Service was quick and cheerful.
Ambience was great, Awesome view of the Singapore river and the Central.
Cons:
Bit expensive
5
Clarke Quay is a must, you have to go, it's on the river and any type of restaurant you want plus lots of pub's with live music. We felt like having Indian food and decided on RAS The Essence of India, we were not disappointed, the food was excellent
4
We had passed this resaurant a couple of times and each time it was full and we couldnt get a table...so booked for the next night. I am vegetarian and had a good choice from the menu. The staff were very helpfull..polite and efficient ..and a pleasure to talk to. The setting is lovely..right by the river..the area clean and well maintained. The food we ate on this occassion was very good and we had no problems. I agree it is a little pricey but no where in this area is cheap unless you eat in the food courts in the shopping malls...and there I struggled to find veggie food. If I return to Singapore I shall eat here again
4
I have eaten here before, and the food is very good.Authentic Indian, cooked just to your liking.As with most places in Clarke Quay, prices are a little exy, but it is a tourist district so to be expected.Nice outlook, friendly and efficient staff who will look after you.Well worth a vist when you are in SIngapore
4
I had a very nice meal at Ras during my last trip to Singapore. The outdoors seating by the water is very nice, the service is good and the food is excellent. The cost was significantly more than I expected it to be, having eaten recently at other very nicely located Indian restaurants at nearby Boat Quay
4
We walked along the key and was drawn from the aromatic smells coming from the tables out the Ras on Clarks Quay, so decided to stop. The welcome was very encouraging and we were asked whe we wanted to st in or out smoking or not river etc. we picked our table and an order for drinks was taken so we could browse the menu. Within a few minutes a man came and asked if we needed any he and we did as London Indian is not Singapore Indian . Anyway we managed to order a modified dish as my wife does no like her Indian hot and this was taken on board without question or issue. The mean arrive and was wholesome tasty and very well presented. We consumed most of it and then had a sweet which was also delicious. So a good experience but it was expensive compared to what we pay in London. RAS nice food but £££££

Wonderful meal with various types of curry. It was very authentic - the best Indian food I've had outside of India. Great selections of naan, dal, tandori shrimp, curried lamb. I was also surpised with the variety of beer available as well. Great service put it over the top. It was also a fantastic location looking out over the river, right in the middle of a very vibrant, busy area of tow

Authentic, tasty and plentiful. Lacks some character and atmosphere but the service is cheerful and quick. A little expensive.

The staff was friendly but they like to talk behind u. You dont know what they might have done to your food but seriously its not comfortable! A jug of tiger for SGD26++ is cheapest along the walkway though.

Good Location, Good place to try some good north India Food. We tried the usual tandoori, Keema naan, Butter Chicken. But bit Pricey!

Excellent Food, We went there on Wednesday , 20th of March 2013, we were there on a 4 day tourist visit, our of our experience in singapore, Clarke quay was the best and Rass made it even more special. There BUTTERRRR CHICKEENNNNNNNNN IS Awesome, dont miss it. Lovely ambiance , we sat near the river tables , enjoyed the awsome view, did GMX Reverse bunjee jump. A bit pricier, but considering the rents they have to pay in singapore and the salaries of the people, i think they haven't priced too much, At the end we went eating good food back to our hotel near by

Picture the scene - wandering along past all the restaurants in Clatke Quay - totally starving. I see an Indian place! My love of Indian food started in the early 90's in the south side of Glasgow. I'll try there, I thought. I know it's. well worn phrase but OMG, I shut my eyes and I was right back in the Anmol tandoori! Being on my own was no problem, the waiters were attentive but unobtrusive. I ordered the Murg Saagwala with Pulao rice. The food was amazing! I wanted to tell someone how good I thought it was, but being on my own, I shut my gob and must have had the cheesiest grin on my face whilst savouring the flavours of the food. Bill came $47 (curry plus 1coke). Not cheap but I didn't care one bit! Flying back to the food nightmare that IS Jakarta tonight....time for lunch??? Oh yeah!!

Great Indian food! Authentic, amazing flavors, great presentation and atmosphere! A bit pricey with typically Indian service (someone is always near you ready to serve, which is good. but sometimes you just want a bit of privacy. Also great RAS lunch buffet at Changi business park at very reasonable price

We went to this restaurant because we were looking for a more authentic Singapore food experience in Clarke's Quay. This restaurant has very good food and service and fit the bill in every way but one - the bill! Quite expensive for what you could get in Little India for much less. However, that's what you get in Clark's Quay area. Enjoyable, but I would try a better value place next time

A frend of mine recommened this restuant in the prestigious restaurants precinet Clarke Quay, the experience was wonderfull. The staff was very friendly and able to understand what we are looking for and inspite of being new to the Indian cuisne, in no time we felt very comfortable with the friendly staff and care they showed on us. The curries and kebab's were fresh, tasty and very flavourfull. We tried the deserts and they were awesome. It was worth spending every single dollor sitting next to the riverside and enjoying a great indian food. They also have a very good wines and other liqour choices. I would recommend this place for a tastefull Indian meal

In October 2012 my partner and I stayed in Singapore for 10 days and dined at many different types of food outlets - China Town, Little India, Clarke Quay, Orchard Road. Unfortunately one night we chose this restaurant and it proved to be the only disappointment to our trip to Singapore. We had 2 mains (no rice), 2 beers and 1 soft drink we then received a bill of $150+. We were not seated outside on the river but inside and at the back of the restaurant. Whilst the food was quite good it was not outstanding

Last night we had dinner here and ordered madras chicken, vindaloo chicken, baigan Bharta, bhindi masala, malai kofta and roomali roti. For the dessert we had the rasmalai and the gulab jamun. For drinks we had Ã  bottle of chardonnay and two small Beers for $241. The food is great and sitting outside is the perfect place to be on the riverside. The staff was very friendly. The one thing that is terrible is the toilet of this restaurant. One toilet for men and women and it was very dirty. Typical India style. So don't go there if you don't really have to. Just use the public one, which is very clean!

The location is great at Clarke Quay by the river....with great north indian food..if you are in sinagpore and craving for north indian food just head for Ras at clarke quay.....

location and service was very impressive. Though the place is manned by few south indians the north indian dishes are good.

We visited this restaurant as we were staying at Clarke Quay . The waiters were welcoming and attentive. The food was tasty with good sized serves.For Singapore the prices were reasonable and overall a good dining experience.

Good indian meal, reasonably priced, for Singapore. We recommend Tandoori chicken as exceptional, clearly cooked in proper Tandoor oven, amazing charcoal flavour and keena naan.

This restaurant is superb. It is situated river front at Clarke Quay which creates a lovely ambience. The food is delicious with a very varied menu. The staff are very attentive without being intrusive. Overall a great dining experience. Highly recommend a visit.

Overlooking the river, the RAS Essence of India restaurant was good value. Food was authentic and well presented. Service was attentive but not obtrusive and the bill was quite cheap by Clarke Quay standards!

We went there with our 7 month old sleeping in his pram - which they made extra room for. The service was brilliant, no plates lingering on the table, no waiting for another drink. The food was yummy. We tried 5 dishes overall: fish masala, goa prawn, chicken tikka, and the lamb rogan josh. All of them were very very tasty. We had a brilliant experience

it sure makes up for you if yo are missing indian food in singapore, and makes up pretty good as the location as well gives u a kick.situated in the buzzing zone of activity in Clark key this place offers excellent food,impeccable service, and a lovely location

I stopped by RAS in Clarke Quay last night, excellent venue, sat outside overlooking the river. I found the service good and the food excellent, cost me just short of $100 for one, but that included a jug of Tiger Beer, Samosa starter and a main with rice and naan, oh and the service charge and taxes.Thoroughly recommended :

If you happen to be in Singapore and you want to spend an evening with your partner in a cosy and well serviced restaurant, you should try 'RAS, the Essensce of India' on Clarkes Quay: You have a romantic view of Singapore River with its small boats with red lamps. At the same time you are in the middle of the hubbub of Clarke Quay, but oddly enough, it's not disturbing.You sit in a restaurant, where the staff is extremely helpful and serviceminded, and most important, they serve the most wonderful indian courses, plentiful and well prepared. And, I may add, at very reasonable prices
