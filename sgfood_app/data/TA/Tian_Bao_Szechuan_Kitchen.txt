The food was either Super salty or very sweet. The Szechuan Signature Marinated Duck was not spicy which is weird. Cus Szechuan dishes are supposed to be spicy

I found few dishes overly sweet. The spicy chicken is without Szechuan pepper!!! Shocking...
Service is ok but it's good for kids.

I first came to this restaurant 3 months ago and right now I am at my desk needing a fix. Especially the fried chicken with dry chilli and the eggplant. Both so shiok and now that I have a taste I can't not go. The prices are good given the classy location and the service as expected. Oh the hot sour soup is also very good

Great place that is comfortable and bright. Only thing is that you are seated on top of one another - felt like I was having dinner with my neighbours.Service is slightly haphazard but friendly. They ran out of steamed rice (not sure how that happens in a Chinese restaurant..) and only told us after about 10 mins after we asked whilst our other food went cold.Other than that beef noodles were really good - noodles were al dente and the soup is light without being too ‚Äúgit‚Äù. Spinach dumplings were not good - stodgy and tasteless. Fish in chilli was another great dish although it was quite salty so probably needed that missing rice

Since I am a fan of Sze chuan cuisine, part of my entourage is to spot a nice Sze chuan restaurant. A frequent customer since it's opening. If you like spicy and is up for Sze chuan go to this place. Conveniently located at heartland after shopping. Light Tim sum (xiao long bao) available but would recommend the noodle dishes like chicken mushroom soup noodle, beef soup vermicelli and mains with rice: spicy fried chicken and garlic steamed prawns/ salted egg prawns

My wife and I visited with a fave voucher, having not been here before. Every dish was very nice, we had the cold chicken slices in chilli oil, Szechuan wok fried prawn balls (which are actually whole peeled prawns), broccoli and mushroom in oyster sauce, pan fried chicken dumplings and Zhong dumpling. The only disappointment was the seafood rice which we thought rather tasteless.Overall, we enjoyed the dishes, they were mildly spiced, good size portions and tasty flavours.Our only complaint is the noise from outside shoppers ! Why do silly parents encourage their children to run around screaming and think it's cute??? This went in the entire meal (I pity the staff), why can't parents teach respect and courtesy for others to their children? The screaming sent me home with a headache and I'm sure I wasn't alone

We had two meals at this restaurant during our visit to Singapore. The first time we had lunch and it was chicken with chilli and cashews and a beef rice dish. The second meal was dinner and we also had duck. The duck was not spicy so it was a good foil to the chilli meal

went for lunch after a bit of shopping in the Takashimaya centre. Nice little restaurant, excellent food and friendly service. The prices are very good and the food is excellent.The food is served quite fast once you order. after reviewing the menu, you make your selections on the form, common in many restaurants, especially Chinese ones. The waiter then reviews your selections to confirm and all good. the tea is priced per cup but it is bottomless, so don't fret. they keep topping it up which is good. The restaurant is nicely decorated and an artful installation on the ceiling using cane steamer baskets of all sizes as the feature. The lettuce wrapped with a slice of Japanese cucumber with a sesame sauce is excellent, super fresh and crunchy lettuce. the mabo tofu was really good. it could have been spicier - we elected to have 'extra spicy' but it wasn't so spicy, but still very good. The serving sizes of the different dishes are just nice to share a few plates between 2. The Xiaolin pau was really good too. hot, fresh and the soup inside was very nice. They have an afternoon tea which is really great value, see the picture. a great way to spend a couple of hours and relax and have a wide range of food choices to snack on. The restaurant also has a really good promotion - for every S$20 you spend, they give you a S$10 voucher to use on your next visit. While you have 1 month to use the voucher, this is a hugely generous promotion. We got S$20 for our next visit if we come back within the next 30 days, so we will definitely be doing that! Highly recommended, nice food, nice surrounds, good price - really good after the promo vouchers - and just an easy, good lunch. highly recommended for friends, couples or familie

Really enjoyed our meal but we were kind of disappointed with the menu. We were in a mood to have chicken/vegetarian and struggled to find options, specially with the starters. However, what we ordered in the end was super delicious and we really enjoyed our meal

Located at 5th floor ngee Ann city. Restaurant is nicely furnished. They serve Sichuan food. I would say price is very reasonable for that upmarket area. We ordered salted egg corn which is good, fried pork stripes with bun(good), you Mai vegetables with dace fish (good) and fried bacon with green chili( is ok)
5
We ordered the signature dish, the Szechuan Dan Dan noodle. Both soup and dry. Both wonderfulüëçüèº the noodle is so bouncy and chewy and the taste is all at the right place. Friendly service too ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Food was pretty good and not expensive. Like it's lotus root soup which is cooked with green beans. We also like its tea choices.
5
Great Chinese food, the hot and sour soup and the glutinous rice dessert as well as the Chilli oil infused dumplings are a must try. Service was excellent will come again
5
Didn't expect a lunch set menu offering so much choices of traditional Szechuan dish like dumpling of different styles and favour at such a give-away price ($9.80++). Also unexpected was the service which matched the best in Spore.

Having been a regular there but still have not exhausted my choice. The last visit with friends, I ordered more variety of appetiser and special tea. They were very good. As usual, my guests love its dessert and you know why just by looking at it from the picture. Well done, especially the friendly staff who make the occasion even better

I had lunch with a colleague at Tian Bao. We ordered the pork strips and their supposedly signature dish - Dan Dan noodles. The pork was swimming in oil, and the noodle were at best mediocre. We asked the waiter for some serviettes and were told that there were none available. This was a first for me. Hopefully it'll be the last too. No wonder there were hardly any guests and they were handing out vouchers for return visits

We booked the Groupon buffet deal and decided to celebrate my friend birthday here, variety wasn't much and food is average. so we ordered a few dishes, some dishes was not available after the first 30mins. After which the fat PRC lady in a very loud tone tell us if we cannot finish the food we need to pay extra many times. As some of the food is not to my friend taste, some of them took a bite and left it there. At the end of the day we did clear the food served with little bits and pieces of semi eaten food. She think of herself as a saint and say she actually should charge us for it! What the hell is this?, so u telling us if u serve us bad tasting food we never finish, try it and never finish is also our fault?!, apart from that we felt like FREAKING PRISONERS!, SHE KEEP STARING AT OUR TABLE AND SEE WHETHER DID WE FINISH OUR FOOD! Please la this type of attitude, GO BACK TO CHINA

There are many offers in the menu but I ordered mostly the value set lunch on weekdays in order to test out all the dishes on offer. The quality has never failed to impress, especially the dumpling dishes and ramen. Comparing with Imperial Treasure and Din Tai Fung who also serve similar dishes, Tian's ramen and soup are more superior without skipping in portion even it is on discount for the set lunch price. Well done

We decided to try the food at Tian Bao after getting a groupon deal with 40% discount. They open for lunch at 11 am. Service was quick, it was not too crowded. The staff speaks English and were polite. We ordered the Sze chuan work-fry prawn balls (18.60), braised eggplant in sweet sour sauce ($12.60), wonton in chilli sauce (8.60) for 6 pcs, zhong dumpling (8080) for 8 pcs, sour spicy soup (7.80). I would highly recommend the delicious dumplings and the tasty prawn balls. Portions were good and the ingredients were fresh.The eggplant taste quite sweet. They charge 30 cents for wet towel and 50 cents for water

This visit is the 3rd visit in a week during the 8 days visit in Singapore. This is real ( a little bit less spicy ) Szhechaun Restaurant in Orchard, probably in town. If you are afraid of Spicy food , you could choose from the menu . I strongly recommend this restaurant if you love spicy food.
