This Starbucks outlet is spacious compared to other outlets.. And the great view is a plus too. A nice place to hang out for a cup of coffee or a little discussion. Friendly staff and outlet is situated in a strategic location.

The staff at this location makes it worth going there.My little girl broke a Starbucks cup off the shelve.they assisted us in a very professional manner.
Just like to thank the manager and staff for assisting us and our little girl.

This is the Starbucks is a must to hang out at. The ambience and just having a coffee there is really enjoyable. Very different feeling from any other starbucks. The wifi is not that good though.

One of the top 5 settings/atmospheres for any Starbucks I've been (and I've been to hundreds). Fantastic view.

I've heard about Starbucks reserve so I went for the store. Really liked the serenity and ambience of the store, however I wasnt treated to a complete starbucks reserve experience. I had to walk to other branch for that. Pity.

Loved it. Great location. Lovely views.
We totally enjoyed ourselves being here and the coffees, croissants and cakes
Would love to visit again

This is a large but very attractive and comfortable Starbucks. The views are fantastic, across the bay to the Marina Bay Sands. If possible, come here on foot as you experience other nearby spots for good views and photo opps. Actually it's a difficult place to get out of a taxi, because if the taxi is traveling north, no stopping is allowed in the narrow area in front of the store just before the bridge.

So cool, this is the 100th Starbucks outlet, and it is in Sigapore!! Here is my review:+ Near with Merlion Park and river+Nice for you who loves Photo Shooting+The 100th Baloon outside the outlet, it's so cool+It's nice if you can visit it at night, the view from above is reaaallly cool, with all the sparkling Lights from the building and the river.+Nice Furniture.+When you tired from all the walking and Photo Hunting, this is the nice place to visit, and try to drink their ice lemon tea, it will lift up your spirit ^^-The Glass window in the left corner of the store is kinda foggy... I Can't take any picture

Yes, the coffee's consistently good, and the view is wonderful.
However, the congeniality of the staff makes all visitors feel most welcomed. This, in turn, makes one's coffee break very pleasant, making you want to linger even longer!

We had a break here, coffee and soft drinks after visiting The Merlion Park. The interior was great, facing the bay. And the music was relaxing and classic.
Look for more reviews by MulleEllum.

I like Starbucks because you know exactly what you get. My favorite is a Latte with caramel sirup and wipped cream. Worldwide the same good taste. Friendly stuff and you have a great riverview.
5
Went to this outlet 2 times. Coffee good, service excellent. There are quiet corners when you just want to be with friends. Great area overlooking the river is good too. Food is good

Lovely drinks, good staff. Standard Starbucks! The different syrups are tasty and I like that you can get skimmed milk!

This is a nice place to work while visiting Singapore. Very friendly staff and great location on the waterfront to Marina Bay. I normally don't fancy Starbucks for the coffee, but this one has many other qualities and coffee is fine.

Located at Fullerton Waterboat House, it has scenic water view through the glass. The place is also very spacious with a number of sofa sets to pass your leisure time reading a book or meeting up with friends to chit chat. Many students were there studying and some even brought their laptops. Nice decorations and wall designs. There is a picture showing the locations of all starbucks outlets in Singapore. Also noted a painting of Samsui women which is indeed part of our heritage.Food is not too bad but the staff needs to be better trained
5
Just a beautiful view and amazing you can enjoy it for the price of a coffee. Do it. Note there are two Starbucks in the immediate area. This one is upstairs in an old building labeled Fullerton Waterboat House. The other one is like every other Starbucks. This one has the money shot
5
This is my favourite Starbucks outlet as it has the view of the River. The ambience is very cosy and the best part is it is not crowded especially on weekdays. It has also a bigger sitting capacity than most of the other outlets. Nice place to wild the time away even if you are alone

We like our Starbucks in general but the view from this caf√É¬© is excellent.The large windows allow you to get a great view of some of the most iconic buildings around the Marina Bay area.The restaurant area was very comfortable with a lot of lounge seating and the air con worked very well.The manager was very passionate about the coffee and customer service.The people in front of us could not make up their mind as they wanted to try something different and started a bit of a queue up so he came over and got them to step aside and had a talk to them about what they usually have and what would suit them that was different.This was great as we got what we wanted in a hurry and they got the help they needed.

This is one of the most beautiful Starbucks shops that I've seen. Really nice interior, beautiful view and really really great staff, especially a girl named Im. Really recommend to visit this place.

Visited for a snack and coffee. The staff were really good and efficient. Bit of a different set up for serving the coffee etc. Loads of seating. Good lattes. My husband got a breakfast meal deal which was really good value.
3
This is a nice Starbucks, it has a good location for tourists to stop in and have a cup of coffee and use the wifi and watch Singapore go by with the big picture windows. It is just a Starbucks though.
5
I had to prepare for some upcoming meetings, and this was a great location with a good view. There are a number of people working here during the day, and the Internet connection was still fast.
4
This Starbucks branch is the best in Singapore. There's a large seating area and the decorations complement the location of this coffeehouse. They serve long-drip coffee here which tastes super awesome!
5
Just outstanding. Beautiful store, great service, cool "slow coffee bar" and relaxing views of the river.
Useful for weekend working with a laptop, although wireless can be a little patchy.
5
If I understand right, this is the 100th Starbucks in the world. It is a little bit more nostalgic. Nice feature: Free Wifi. The Coffee and Food is the normal great Starbucks quality. Staff is very friendly. Same pricelevel like germany.

Comparing this only on other Starbucks shops in Singapore and this was pretty horrible experience.- Coffee tasted like water, - Service couldn't speak english,- They didn't know what their cakes have in them,- This place smells like old oil/engine room of a shipLow quality, maybe we was there on a bad day

Located just across the road of Fullerton hotel, offer limited drinks such as red velvet mocha n chestnut for the time being. There are high seats by the glass if u wanna see the mbs n esplanade view in Singapore. This cafe is very spacious and suitable for friends gathering, family coffee or tea time or just chillin alone after museum hopping from National Gallery to Asian Civilisation Museum ^

I spent an afternoon watching the rain from this Starbucks, and I will say it was simply one of the greatest experiences I have ever had in a coffee shop. Your time here will be absolutely wonderful where you can enjoy a laid-back atmosphere and a view that is spectacular. Enjoy
