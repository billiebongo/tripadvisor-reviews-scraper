The food there wasn't too expensive. The pork cutlet was very big in size and it was quite worth it for the price. Teriyaki chicken wasn't too salty. Gyoza portion a bit small given the price.
Will come back again.

Nice lobsters shabu-shabu, very nice Japanese pork soup base! Not expensive too, just spend $59.90 for 2 persons. The serving is huge. Value for money.
