Tried their famous Tau Sar Piah and I like it, other than it is too sweet for me. The taste is good.

Loong Fatt Tau Sar Piah in 639 Balestier Road is definitely the best in Singapore. It's different from the Penang version .

Have tried all the tau sar piah (local bean biscuit) shops along Balestier Road and this is the best! Go in the morning to get the freshest batch of biscuits. Love these!!!

One for $0.80 and it is the best in town!! Prepare to queue if you are here. Waiting time can be between 15-30 mins or more.
Well the queue speaks for itself.. there are other shops but none can match..

This is one of my favorite tau sar piah. I love the "sweet" ones. I normally drop by on a weekday. Didn't expect to have a long queue on sat!

You must try this traditional Tau Sar Piah (biscuits). They only offer 2 flavours of the Tau Sar Piah, sweet or salty. The crust of each biscuit is nicely made, crispy on the outside and full of favour in the inside. They would bake the biscuits in the morning, and they are usually sold out by mid-afternoon. You will see a long queue on most weekend afternoons.In addition, if you are there in the morning, you can also try the assorted cakes; these cakes are just like those sold in an old HDB estate confectionery. Their cakes are as good as their Tau Sar Piah. The shop has been for many years, and owners are getting older. Should you be in the vicinity of Balestier areas, please try it before it is gone.

The best tau sar piah I've ever had in singapore. Very convinient location because it's near my house. The place is really humble but you will have to queue up to get the tau sar piah. The skin is flaky and crispy. The filling is just right. Yummy!!

at 70c each (updated price), worth every bite. The skin is flaky and nice, and the fillings is generous and compact. Choose between salty and sweet. I personally prefer the salty one coz it is slightly salty and sweet. The sweet one is too sweet to the taste

Woke up early today just to get here to buy the freshly bake tau sar piah. I was not disappointed. When I took over the boxes of tau sar piah, it was still hot. I took a bite and it was awesome. The pastry was crispy and the filling was rich. The rest was history, once started, it was pretty much unstoppable until you have none left in the box :). Till next time, I will be back to buy more

We were there on a Saturday afternoon around 2 pm and there was already a long queue. The queue simply gets longer as we waited. We managed to buy the snacks after half an hour. I bought both the sweet and the salty ones. Honestly, I cannot tell the difference, and both were so good. They tasted good even the next day. I think it is worth while queuing for this traditional snack at such reasonable price ($0.70 each)
