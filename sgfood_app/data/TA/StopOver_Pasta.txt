Since I discovered this place a couple of weeks ago I have lunch there multiple times a week. There is only 5 different choices of sauce but the pasta are simply excellent! All is homemade, and prices vary from 9 to 14 depending on the size you chose (the small size is more than enough but you can share the larger portion between 2 people if you're not too hungry).Finally a good pasta place in Singapore
