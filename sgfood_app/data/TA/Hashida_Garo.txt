I went here a long time ago and I remembered having a good lunch Omakase here but there was nothing special.

Garo is my new go-to place for desserts. Starting as low as 3-4bucks, Garo offers light, refreshing and beautiful desserts for a tired palate.
Standouts for me were Kuzu kiri and the mizu manjyu.
Already been there thrice in 2 weeks.

Another little hidden gem that not many tourists know about yet. The set meals are relatively cheap for this level of food. Highly recommend the desserts especially the roti canai ball looking water chestnut.

I've never been a fan of Japanese dessert and taste-wise, this place hasn't changed my opinion. To me, Japanese dessert just lacks the body and fullness of western desserts. Having said this, the presentation here is exquisite, although the portions small (another drawback of Japanese desserts). The cafe/restaurant is also done up tastefully (except for some awful artwork on the walls), with a tea ceremony platform right in the middle. All in all, an elegant experience although not truly satisfying.

Food and desserts are of high quality. The unagi and onigiri are really tasty! Portion are too small though. I loved the matcha financier, the cheesecake as well as the water dumplings! Yum yum! I would definitely come back here for more of their deserts! I tried the Hojicha, Matcha and yuzu macarons. It felt a little too hard. Okay, Im a little biased here as I am a great fan of Laduree/Pierre Hermes macarons. Well the macarons are good and I love the unique flavours, but nowhere outstanding.Service wise it's pretty mediocre at best. It will be good if the staff can be more proactive ; to introduce us what to eat/drink/chefs recommendation. Service was prompt, but not personalised at all. This place has great potential, and food was made to perfection. If the service can be just as good, it will definitely entice more customers

My friends and I went to Hashida Garo in July 2015, few weeks after their opening. Hashida Garo is new concept of a Japanese Gallery (Garo means gallery) featuring traditional Japanese desserts with a twist. It also provides fine-dining-esque service but in a more family-like settings. The seating of the gallery was a big square (we could all face each other) surrounding a space for a traditional tea ceremony. Service was prompt and their staff were very knowledgeable. Despite being a dessert-focused restaurant, there were also set lunches like the unagi set and ozaki A5 beef set. We chose the unagi set and were blown away. The portion ain't huge but it was satisfying. The unagi itself was huge and the sauce was excellent. The entire dish just blended so well and left us with that umami feeling. Next up was the highlights - a series of desserts consisting of Sorbet, water dumplings, cheese cake and many more. I won't go on to describe all of them but overall, the desserts was all made to perfection. They were simply a class on their own. The passion of the Chef Hashida and his creativity simply flows inside the desserts. One example is the water dumplings, where he married the traditional wat-droplet dumpling with a filling of Singapore Kueh Kueh - powerful stuff. Another must-try is the Foie Gras macaroons. A simply must-try for any desserts lover. Overall, the food was made to perfection and the service was wonderful. I would definitely be back
