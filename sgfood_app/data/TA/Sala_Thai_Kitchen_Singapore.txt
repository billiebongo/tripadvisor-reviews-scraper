Used to eat here a lot during lunch time and moved out of singapore 2 years ago. Returned to the office and for lunch. Pad thai too wet but ok. Expensive at $17 for that and a coke

Working in metropolis, good lunch options are limited and this is 1 of the few that pass muster. They have decent lunch sets and i usually go for the green curry. The basil chicken is too spicy
Nice bunch of thai staff too

Love the taste of the Thai food here as itâ€™s located just below Metropolis at Buona Vista. Never disappointed with the food, a tad pricy , a single dish is about $13.90 upwards but very satisfying. Service is fast and the staff are friendly and greet you with a smile even during the busy lunch hour. So easy to get here , just take the train to Buona Vista mrt .

We are here every fortnight since it is a stone's throw from work. What is excellent on this authentic menu are the prawns fried in glass noodles (a special request), basil minced chicken and wonderfully tender and char-grilled pork with chili dip. End your quick lunch off with the red rubies (potato starch coated water chestnuts) and Thai ice milk tea ice cream. Am so going to miss this place when I leave.

I had a quick lunch here and loved the green curry. I was a bit hesitant after reading some of the reviews about portion size in the lunch set, but it's enough -- no one needs a big bowl of curry for themselves. it felt nice to eat Thai food at lunch and not go back to work in a food coma. Only 4 stars because the veg spring rolls that came with the set were really not good -- similar to the terrible frozen version you buy at the grocery store. I'd advise the restaurant to replace with a better option as to keep the quality of the entire meal high. Service was friendly and efficient

Rather crowded and cramped with tables very close to each other. Don't go there if you want a quiet lunch or want a good conversation over the meal. The service is business-like and very fast. Our entire meal took 35 mins! The beef noodle soup was tasty and the Kee Moa fried rice noodles was decent. Lemongrass drink was refreshing. That was all we ordered for two people and it came up to S$20 each. Somewhat pricey for a simple quick meal

Even though we had the set lunch which was supposed to be cheaper than a la carte, for the price paid, it was not very good value. After taxes, it was about S$16 (USD 13) for a green curry set. The set came with a serving of rice, 3 small veg spring rolls and a small bowl of green curry. A really small bowl of curry about 150ml max. It tasted quite good but for the price, i would have expected a bit more... there are plenty of other places around that give much better value

The food at this small eatery is delicious. Prices are reasonable and it is packed. You sit, eat and leave. We tried the lunch set of Thai green chicken curry, rice and spring rolls. The seafood glass noodles is delicious with lots of fresh prawns and vegetables. The service was fast

Had a simple Thai dinner here where the experience is a little more than expected. Great simple ambiance, Great food, and great service. This is partly due to the owner is still being rather hands on with the business.MUST TRY: Omelette and the Thai Tomyam soup of course.Looking forward to go again
