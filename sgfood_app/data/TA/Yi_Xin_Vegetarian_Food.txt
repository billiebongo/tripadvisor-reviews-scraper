This place offers economic completely vegan meals. The setup is friendly, almost like entering somebody's house.

Crowded coffee-shop setting. Food served economy-rice style. Some of the dishes were undercooked so the veg was tough & fibrous. Taste-wise was average.

I was walking around the city when I walked past this place and was tempted by the smell. I went in and had a meal, I was surprised by how cheap the meal was and even more by how tasty it was. I also went to this place on the following 2 days

I have been coming here for years. Still good quality, mostly processed soy meat/tofu food. They have modernized their seating area inside and outside. It used to be just a counter where you pick and chose. Now they have a menu but you can still just ask for a Laksa or Mee Reebus and they will make it for you. Very inexpensive, though prices have gone up a bit since they modernized. No fine dining, but good vegetarian food

Yi Xin Vegetarian Food is my go to lunch spot in Chinatown. They offer a huge selection of freshly made food every day at an amazing price; $4 for a giant plate of rice and three mains! The variety will blow your mind, try something new every day. I highly recommend the yellow curry and the aubergine dish. Yi Xin is good for a quick lunch or a takeaway. There's seating but it can get crowded during peak lunch hours and there's no air-con, just fans. I always brought my own drink as you have to buy them from the cooler next door. Cash only

very inexpensive food, great variety, and delicious--the spicy eggplant is divine . . . and located in wonderful Chinatown. We too had to double-check the absence of meat, seems soy protein technology is of the highest order in Singapore (we often had to double-check in other vegetarian restaurants).We ate here several times, never had the slightest complaint about service or cleanliness of utensils etc. But please, do keep in mind this is a local hawker-style outlet, not silver service. If you want Michelin rated restaurants, pass on by, but it would be your loss

The food is amazing and cheap but the customer service is totally a matter of luck. I went there twice, the first time at 9 am on a Saturday morning, the staff were super welcoming and patient. The second time at 8 pm on a Sunday night, the staff were like walking dead, poker face and dead eyes with no life in it, reluctant to even answer a yes or no question. It is very ironic if you look at their posters outside, all about spreading the dharma through kindness and buddhist practice, yet some staff can't even smile or say kind words to you. They don't really walk the talk. But, do come here for the food

A good standby and open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This place has a good selection of cooked veg dishes to choose from as well as a menu to order soups and other dishes. It obviously has many regular customers who prefer to eat pure vegetarian food. It also has a small grocery section and a drinks stall attached to get tea/coffee/beer.The larger shared tables inside lead to great conversation with locals or you can sit outside at the smaller tables and watch the world go by
