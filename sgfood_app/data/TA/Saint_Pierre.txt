St Pierre has an excellent location, the food is great, but (perhaps this was a shortcoming on my side) there was little in the way of communication regarding the menu choices. We ended up with a 5-course and topped up (when the 7-course would have included everything we topped up for, at a lower cost). 5-course + top up + Australian white for S$ 990 is not that great of a deal, particularly for a 1-Michelin star. There are better values to be had in Singapore, even if you limit yourself to the Guide Michelin
5
The set lunch menu was really good and reasonably priced. We enjoyed every dish and the view of the marina bay sand. The service is also great. Waiters are kind and tentative. The chef came around towards the end to check on us. We are very happy with our lunch and will definitely come back
5
We are foodies, we follow the finest, the trendiest and the most acclaimed.Saint Pierre has catapulted to near the top of our favourites list.Singapore is filled with fine food, but the execution was exemplary.Outstanding dinner, superb very friendly/precise service, everything delicious and exceptionally flavours and presentation.A very good dining experience
5
Menu was extensive, food was delicious and creative, while service was excellent. Very reasonably priced set menu for lunch
4
It is kind of fusion (Japanese + French). The chef used a lot of ingredient from Japan (e.g: corn, scallop, miso paste, garnish, fish, ikura)I like the "free" sourdough bread, made freshly. It is moist inside and crisp outside.We had discovery menu which is a 8 course meal.Restaurant is not big, advice to make reservation in advance
5
2nd star beckons. Loved the food; refined cuisine with inventiveness. Improvements: Mains (Beef and Pigeon) were slightly salty but does not diminish the overall enjoyment. Will definitely be back.
5
View to kill with good food and great service and at a reasonable price. Ditch André, Odette or Jaan and make your way here. You won’t regret it
3
Food was more on fusion than French styled.a bit disappointed but it tasted well.no goie gras in the menu
5
Had our team Christmas dinner here and enjoyed the view of marina bay sands. Not often we get to see the chef come out to serve us so that was quite a nice touch. All the dishes were very nice and topped off with a lovely petite four selection.
5
Second visit in 3 years. Moved from Seotosa to Marina bay. One of the best Asian-French cuisines I have experienced.. wonderful food. The taste of the food was so balanced that it well suits Asians as well as Westerners. Staffs were friendly and very asttentive. Wine selections were excellent. Can’t wait to come back
5
This place is suitable for you to bring your prospective clients for a good meal to clinch a good deal.
5
This restaurant has been around for a while, about 20 years. Moved a couple of times and this latest location is at 1 fullerton with a good view of marina bay sands. And got a michelin star tooThey have the classic, discovery and adventure menus. We went for the middle, 8 coursesFirst couple of courses were seafood, then meat. All very good. The owner emmanual stroobont was in and even served a couple of dishes himselfI don't know why they push their bottled water so hard. That $10 x 2 earned is not worth my ire when i prefer just regular ta
5
We tried the 12 course Adventure menu, and the food was excellent in general. Most unusual was the parsley ice cream, which was unexpectedly delicious and fragrant, paired with caviar. Starters, pigeon, artichoke, and crab were also memorable. Petit fours push cart was a nice touch. Lovely view of the bay and Marina Bay Sands.
3
Came here with friends and thought of celebrating for early Christmas dinner, this is a French cuisine but the food tasted like Japanese ! No foie gras, dick confit, oyster, escargot. How possible to have such surprises in French restaurant and worst thing we have Chef menu but missing the typical French Favourite. Good environment to overlook the Marina Bay sand but not so impressive with one star Michelin French restaurant for sure. I won't be back for sure ..disappointing as I probably get a better one in Japanese restaurant that served these food better. The Pigeon is great but too raw to some people!
5
My friend and I had the most wonderful evening at Saint Pierre - unquestionably one of Singapore’s best fine dining restaurants. The dining room is spacious but intimate and has a grandstand view of Marina Bay and the iconic Marina Bay Sands towers. The service was professional and friendly - really delightful. The wine list is about as good as one can be - comprehensive and full of interesting and reasonably priced choices without being totally overwhelming and ridiculously long. And the food - all the way through (we had the Discovery menu) - was sublime - every course !!! Saint Pierre is destined for 2 stars, and I can’t wait to return.
3
Friends recommended so we visit at lunch time for 3course $58++. Excellent view to MBS and bay, food is also in good presentation but, taste not as good as expected, they are fine but not worth a Michelin*. And for dessert we choose 'chocolate' but get some tiny cakes and sorbet in caramel roll, nothing we found as chocolate. The waiter likes standing/walking around guests to provide best service, but sometimes we feel bit 'disturbed'.
5
my second visit and the food consistency is always on point! KUDOS!!! was feeling adventurous that night. so had the Adventure culinary experience hahahha. Definitely took my taste buds for a sensational ride! highly recommended
3
Business lunch. 3course, 58$++It all looked fabulous, but it did not taste anything. A new launch, of an interesting menu, and there was no lobster? Not ok for a * restaurant, not ok at all. The dessert was the highlight, so obviously a great pastry chef. Good and efficient service. Surprisingly they have a Michelin *. With 8 years in France, French food has a very special place in our hearts. This is a new take, but flavors are forgotten.
5
The restaurant is so amazing ! their service and food is extremely superb with nice view to MBS. Highly recommended
5
I had never been to Saint Pierre, but I read about the restaurant with the amazing view over Marina Bay. I was very curious to try the Michelin Star restaurant, and all I can say it deserves two stars! I was incredibly impressed by the service of the team they were very attentive and so detailed. The food was absolutely fantastic and I can recommend this to anyone who wants an amazing experience and a taste of finest French inspired cuisine. The cod seaweed was absolutely brilliant!
5
Authentic French cooking here with beautifully plating, attentive service staff, and amazing ambience! I'd come again!
5
I really enjoyed everything I had here! The food was very delicious and service was very good. We had a 4 course dinner but we ended up doubling that, with pre-dessert, dessert cart, etc. So happy I chose this place for my sister's birthday. I will definitely be back.
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday here a few days ago. The place was cosy and intimate. Ambience was fantastic as we were seated next to the window and had an excellent view of MBS and the Singapore River. The food was, needless to say, Michelin-star worthy -every dish impeccably prepared and delicious. Service was also excellent with very attentive staff who introduced every dish to us. We were also pleasantly surprised that the chef came out to greet us and take pictures with us - certainly a nice touch. The highlight of the meal was when they presented us a special dessert - the Celebration Petits Fours to celebrate my wife's birtthday - truly a fitting finale to the evening. The only thing that we felt could have been done better was the fact that we were presented with an assortment of cheese on a cheese table towards the end of the meal which we thought was part of the set menu but which was charged separately when we received the bill. We should have been told that it was not included in the set so that we could have made an informed decision as to whether the cheese assortment. Other than that, we were certainly very pleased with the overall experience of dining at this restaurant

Saint Pierre is a one Michelin Star restaurant and chef Emmanuel Stroobant clearly works hard to retain the rating . The food was exquisite, ingredients top notch and one could see the artistry in the food . A fantastic wine list , a collection of curated cheese and Australian truffles if you fancy some. But before I jump to give it a perfect rating , here is the catch ... value for money. Even for luxury dining when you know you are there to spend , $400+ For a vegetarian meal for two ( without wine ) is expensive by most standards. Go there when you want to impress someone, otherwise there are many five star hotels in town that will offer similar or better deals at half the price .
4
Food was very impressive. Ambiance is just okay. It took us 4.5 hours to complete the 13 course dinner. It would be best to shorten it to 3 to 3.5 hours, maximu
4
Celebrated my husband's birthday at the restaurant.Great food, impeccable service. We truly enjoyed the experience.
5
We had been to this restaurant many years ago in one of its previous locations in Singapore. It was a favourite then and after a return this week it is likely to become so again in One FullertonThe combination and subtleties of flavours is true culinary art but without the pretension that some Michelin star restaurants can have Great service, attentive but never invasive, excellent and reasonably priced wines by glass and bottle, this is one of those experiences you remember way longer than the short term credit card "ouch"I highly recommend it and it is probably the best dining experience I have had in the last decade. Congratulations Emmanuel and team and thank you !
5
We just had dinner with friends at Saint Pierre. We had known Saint Pierre for a long time from its days at the Central Mall. After reading that Saint Pierre had been awarded one Michelin star, we decided to come back for a renewed dining experience.We had a wonderful dinner with outstanding food and service. It was good to see Edina and Emmanuel again. Edina was the most gracious hostess in any high end restaurant in Singapore.The view overlooking the Marina Bay and the MBS hotel was nothing short of spectacular.If anyone had not been to Saint Pierre, we strongly recommend a visitKudos to Edina and Emmanuel for a rejuvenated Saint Pierre!
5
Though it doesn't provide complementary parking like another Michelin Star restaurant, I am not so angry as the other time. Because this restaurant is really worth a Michelin Star. It has a 13-course and 26-course menu for you to choose. Don't be scare of by its number. We have tried 13-course and the portion adjust accordingly. We feel just nice after 13 course and we definitely want to challenge 26-course next time. The restaurant has a nice Marina Bay view and their waiters/waitress are friendly unlikely the other one who you don't feel the welcome/warmth gesture.
5
Visited second time, moved a year ago to Marina bay. Didn't disappoint me. Excellent mixture of oriental taste and french taste that both Asians and westerners would enjoy. Wine paring is highly recommended. Price was more than worth. Careful service wih outstanding hospitaliy. A must place in Singapore
5
It was an epic evening. The service, food and wines selection are absolutely fabulous. We had a great night out. Thank you St Pierre! We will be back :)
4
A restaurant on a hidden second floor with a huge view overlooking MBS !! Food is the usual expected very good. Service is excellent
5
Had dinner there July 2017. Had the discovery menu. The food was divine!!! Every bite was interesting - in terms of taste and texture. The service was excellent too! Recommend for special occasions.
5
My first experience at Saint Pierre. We picked the discovery menu and were surprised by every course served. Wonderful taste and flavour. The birthday celebration complimentary by the restaurant was also a delightful surprise. Thumbs up!
5
On the night we booked we couldn't get into the restaurant we checked out. That was good as it meant we went to Pierre 's. A classic top end French restaurant with s view over the bay so we could see the light displays through floor to ceiling glass.The food was a set classic menu with wine and cheese.Not cheap but absolutely superb.That night we were the only diners and it helped to make it a lovely eveningThe staff were excellent, food faultless and as it was our honeymoon , we were presented with a celebration platter of hand made chocolates
3
Came here for a birthday celebration. Have not been here since they moved from Sentosa - view is spectacular. Service is French style so its a bit slower as one is suppose to chat around the table - the really friendly head waiter was not there. Food was a bit disappointing - some dishes were good. Some dishes just flopped at the concept stage. A bit disappointed that when we made some requests for changes in the menu, that the additional charges were not highlighted until we paid for the bill. There probably are a bit few better restaurants in Singapore for this type / range of food.
5
It's hard to find a chef who not only understands but truly celebrates vegan gastronomy in Singapore, but at Saint Pierre we found the exception. A truly wonderful degustation menu filled with seasonal produce and amazing flavour. Highlight was the crusted artichoke, and the white asparagus dishes.A beautiful view and a wonderful, cosy and sophisticated dining room. We had an amazing evening
5
We came to Saint-Pierre to celebrate a momentous life event. Our out-of-this-world experience means we will remember our celebration for many years to come.Saint-Pierre faces Marina Bay Sands directly (it's parallel to it), and the view across the bay to it is magnificent. We spent four hours savouring the food, the view, and the refined but relaxed atmosphere. The waiters were friendly and attentive; and the master himself, Chef Stroobant, greeted us with his radiant smile, made us feel welcome and conversed with us. When we told him what we were celebrating, he made a special and deeply moving effort to make our evening extra special - with gestures we will always treasure.One indulges in fine dining to become aware and enlightened about, and inspired by, the potential of food and nourishment as art. Every dish we were served was incredible and had me see new potential of each ingredient - new ways I could start cooking and experiencing food. The combination of flavours and ingredients was unique, and exquisite. We ordered the vegetarian menu, and it was simply fabulous.I was so inspired by Chef Stroobant that I asked if he had a cookbook. He indeed does and let me have a copy in exchange for any donation amount I wished to make. All donations for the sale of his cookbook go to the Singapore Children's Society, which cares for disadvantaged children, including children with cancer. A placard near the door explains what the Society does.Saint-Pierre's food is at least as wonderful as Odette - which we also highly recommend - but the view is better at Saint-Pierre and the waiters at Saint-Pierre, we found, are friendlier - although very polite, they interact with customers without obvious formality. I have little doubt that it is Chef Stroobant who has set the tone for the heartwarming but refined atmosphere at this remarkable establishment.Tip: We came for dinner and felt it was thoroughly worth the price; but Saint-Pierre also has prix-fixe several-course lunches for very reasonable prices for truly gourmet dining

I went to this restaurant for lunch with my french husband . To be honest, we were not having a high expectations since almost all the restaurant we tried in Singapour We're not so impressed so far..... But surprisingly, the food was very good and well presented. Light and colorful design of the food in plate. Sauce was tasty, not heavy. Using good fresh ingredients.... Personalized Good service, very much appreciated! Definitely going back sometime.
3
I have visited this restaurant for total of three times each of the visit was very different. Back when they were at Sentosa I was left with the feeling they were lost in between classic fine dining or casual fine, however what left most impression was the food: nothing was good enough and there was so many flower petals everywhere that add no value to the plates. Back visiting them at the new place in One Fullerton, just few days after the opening - sadly both the service and food were greatly disappointing. Last visit was actually so much better, the menu was very well rehearsed with subtle note of Japanese cuisine everywhere. Cheese selection seems bit tired. No doubt on them taking full fledged fine dining back. Nice for business lunch but don't expect it to be fast
4
I would like to recommend this place especially for corporate lunch with clients.
Nice ambience. Good service.
Food is nicely presented and quite tasty.
5
Great venue for a date. Nice ambiance. Great staff. Had a good experience with many "surprise" courses.
5
You have a choice of 3 degustation style menus, ranging in price from expensive to quite expensive. You will not be disappointed whichever way you go, with every dish carefully presented and introduced by the staff. While the cost may be hard to justify, it is a wonderful place for a special occasion
4
A very charming place serving French cuisine. Limited seats; so booking needed. Cater to vegan and vegetarian needs even within the set menu. Chef is vegatarian himself apparently. Fine collection of wines as accompaniments. Recommend this place to celebrate special occasions like anniversaries or birthdays
3
Hubby and I dined here to celebrate his birthday first week of January. We took the "Discovery Menu" + "Wine pairing".The good things first: very nice view of the Marina Bay, we liked that there were only few tables around, we liked that the chef welcomed us himself and asked for feedback about the food from time to time, we liked the nice young French waiter who knew a lot about the food that were served to us. Also, the food was very good all in all and we also liked the white wine from Argentina.What we didn't like so much: we found the sommelier a little bit inattentive and didn't seem to ask feedback about the wine. Also, he did not even notice that we did not at all touch the sweet wine that he served with the dessert. Apart from one white wine that we liked, all the other glasses of wine served were average.Lastly, we most especially enjoyed the dramatic presentation of the birthday dessert but when we found that it was less enjoyable to eat than when we were watching them do it -- smoke effects and all... They asked for my feedback in an email but did not even bother to thank me for it. I'm not even sure if they read it.All in all, it is still a very good restaurant. I would recommend it for special occasions only as it is very expensive. And also, we have dined in other places less expensive but with better service and better food and better experience for the amount that we paid
5
This restaurant serves nice French food. They provide 3 kinds of lunch set menu, differentiated by the price, $58, $85, and $100 ++. Very nice food, nice scenery overlooking Marina Bay Sands building and Singapore river. Perfect and proper service. A must try when in Singapore
4
It took us a while to find the entrance to the restaurant as it's hidden in the side of one of the buildings.Once there, it's a nice space with a fantastic view of the harbour.Service is efficient and lovely.Food was fantastic with the fave being the roasted lobster although I wish we had more of it.Meal was good value with the set lunch and overall, very filling. Great place for a catch up or business lunch
4
Hosted our corporate dinner at the restaurant, and we booked the whole restaurant. Good service with great view of the marina bay sands. Service was excellent and the food was also well prepared.
4
Great service and view. Tried their set lunch which is good and I will highly recommend people to try out this place. Looking forward to going back again
5
What can I say? We've been following Chef Emmanuel for a few years. He's been consistently serving quality food with lots of new ideas. I especially love how he incorporate lots of healthy ingredients like turmeric, beetroot into the fine dining concept. Service is good and professional. Food is always up to the high standard and great selections of wine list too. Lunch at 1 Fullerton is definitely great value for money(from $58). Do watch out for the extra charges if you opt for the petite four and coffee (which is another extra $30++) total of $85++ and cheese is another ++. Of course, you can't put a price on great food and good location and view. Definitely my Favourite Chef and restaurant in Singapore. Will come back again and again! Good for romantic dinner and again, lunch is always great value
5
Excellence service & ambience with perfect food. The crew know very well of the food & wine pairing. Perfect experience for our special day
5
A restaurant in the true tradition of haut cuisine where the chef/owner is always there between cooking and looking after his customer.... and cook he can. Wonderful! and complemented by a spectacular wine list at very fair price by Singapore standards.
5
We visited Saint Pierre for my birthday and it was such a special night. From being greeted at the door to leaving, the staff at Saint Pierre made our night one to remember. They were friendly, attentive and did not rush us like most restaurants do!The food was so delicious and of such high quality, the mushroom entree was a stand out. We were too full for desert but will definitely be back to try them
5
The combination of the various ingredients in each dish was creative and complemented each other. You can tell that a lot of thought went into the presentation and cooking of the dishes. Chef Stroobant was very friendly and he certainly looked like he enjoyed his work. The service was excellent. The staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive. We asked the sommelier to recommend a wine within our budget and his recommendation was great! I would certainly return to this restaurant
3
When Emmanuel and his wife started their Singapore business in 2000, they were the hottest news in town. Since then, they have experimented and ventured into new dinning concept, consultancy, catering and many others. When they returned to intimate fine dinning at One Fullerton, of course I have high expectation given his past achievement and present capability. Our group of 30 had a private function with Furst German wine maker here a few days ago. The location is stunning with priceless view of Singapore's prime waterfront. Service was professional and impeccable. However, the taste of food was ordinary compare to the same in class. The "artisan" bread was stale and dry, duck breast too pink and tough. What save our day was the the great Furst Spatburgunder Centgrafenberg 2005 and the great cheese! Perhaps group party is not their cup of tea. We might have to try it again in much smaller group
4
This was a business lunch, 16 people, set menu. Choice of fish, meat, vegetarian selected in advance. Sea bass was wonderful (as was the foie gras starter, soup and desert). Good wines, first class service throughout. Restaurant is also nicely situated near the Merlion with a good view from one side of the table.Have not yet tried the restaurant for a normal evening service, but they did a really good job for this lunch event
4
Everything was good from service to restaurant ambience, and the creativity of the dishes. The restaurant is overlooking to the marina bay with The SANDS right opposite to it. The only suggestion I would like to share here is the first serving of pigeon with a jus which was a dark gravy that did not really stand up to the standard. The taste of the jus was not pleasant, let it be the red wine or the spices used. However, the second serving of the roasted pigeon leg was good. Overall, it was a good fine dining experience. I certainly will visit this restaurant again
5
There is a reason why this is the only Relais et Château in Singapore. We went yesterday to celebrate our anniversary and we had a fantastic experience. The service is impeccable, the view fantastic and the food delectable. The mushrooms were the highlight with the chocolate desert. Not cheap but worth the value for sure.
5
I went to Saint Pierre with my fiancée for our Anniversary and we had a wonderful time. Food was michelin start standard, view on MBS in unique and staff is super professional and caring. We had this amazing surprise desert made in front of us by the chef himself. Just unique!100% recommended
5
Excellent restaurant, food, service, ambiance. I highly recommend it. Very happy about the experience.
5
Emmanuel is a superb Chef and Thia restaurant is in an excellent setting. He has invested in service and it shows.
5
Expect great and imaginative food, fantastic wine list and amazing view. The experience is more fine dining than their previous restaurant. This would be a great place for a celebration or date. Food is superlative.
5
I brought my parent to experience fine dining during my birthday. Its their 1st time and the chef and waiters make it a wonderful experience for them explaining each course and the wine paired patiently.
5
Amazing experience in the new St Pierre on marina view ,food outstanding in fine dining served by top stylish staffs and well traine.
5
Had the Grand Earth 10-course meal which was awesome. A lot of surprises especially the amuse bouche, assorted breads and various trolleys. enjoyed the overall dining experience with well presented food at top quality! Love the caviar, langoustine and pigeon dishes.Friendly chef Emmanuel and warm service from the rest
5
Since their relocation at One Fullerton, and after few months of adjusting to the new environment, they finally found their mark.The adaptation of a new working space always bring some constrain at the start and yes, it is not easy. And for this new chapter, even if they had a slow start, the bounce back is great...I went for a business lunch recently, and we had the chance to meet the new executive chef, Mathieu Escoffier which enhance Emmanuel Stroobant's cuisine. The service being perfect, the food is the expectation. From the start you have a beautiful bread assortiment, Amuse bouche and the Ceviche as a perfect appetite opener, we settled on the "Foie Gras" and the "Mushroom Ravioli and Consomme". Both delicious with a special mention for the Mushroom.We followed with the "Artic Char" (FYI: cold and fresh water fish; related to salmon and lake trout) and the "Pigeon" which again were delicious, full on flavours and perfect balance...With all of that, they do have an amazing cheese trolley, which shows a full veriaty of what cheese can be. Full range, from the hard cow cheese to some beautiful creamy goat cheese. And for cheese lovers, you could spend the all lunch or dinner only with it.Finally, we ended with the "Cinnamon-Raspberry Meringue" as a perfect, light and refreshing dessert.A must go...The only complain will be: Can I have more, please...
5
To start with, it is an Emmanuel Stroobant restaurant, but to give credit where credit is due, it is Mathieu Escoffier who is the excellent executive chef. When it comes to food, my first impression is always the bread. If a restaurant cannot serve good bread while you are hungry and take the first few sips of the wine, then you are off to an awful start for the evening. But this was not the case as St Pierre had an excellent blend of bread, served piping hot from the oven. The seaweed butter was good, but to my taste, I probably would have preferred it to be a bit saltier to bring out the aroma of the butter to go with the freshly baked bread. The degustation meny was excellent. We chose the Earth menu, which consisted of six courses, and it was plenty, considering you also tasted the variation of bread on the side. The style of the food is fresh and modern, to the tune of being a little bit over engineered in the attempt of trying to bring out something new and different. All dishes were well prepared and nicely presented, and some of them you needed to check back on the menu to see what you were actually eating. The flavour combinations of the dishes (Caviar, Arthichoke, Lobster, Cod and Lamb) were as per the Earth theme; fresh, light and with a hint of citrus. Even the lamb dish was so light that it could be paired with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. The service was impeccable; very friendly and attentive! We were there to celebrate my son's birthday, and without divulging too much of the surprise, they treated our party with a birthday treat that was far beyond the normal chocolate cake with a candle. I normally don't get impressed by a restaurant, but this time I was. The setting was comfortable and nice, not elaborate, and the restaurant is catering to a more discerning clientele. If there is a fault to mention, it would be the reflections on the windows that ruined an otherwise spectacular view of the MBS. It would be worthwhile for St Pierre to bring in a lighting expert to take a look on how they can get away with the hanging modern looking chandilier that causes the reflections. St Pierre is definitely one of the best restaurants in Singapore, and a strong candidate to at least one Michelin star in the next year's guide book. One final note, they have BYO on Mondays, so if you have a good bottle of Champangne or white wine in the cellar awaiting to be paired with some great food, St Pierre is the place to go on a Monday night.Kevin Ta

The only good things about that evening were the service ( friendly and courteous staff) and the view on MBS. The rest was just ..sub sub standard . House white wine was undescript . The meal was very bad and we were 10 of us .. Over cooked sole with some lobster purée to make it edible ? All the appetizers had white mousse or foam on it ? ( why ?) scallop was buried in three layers of white purée, green ingredient ( spinach or parsley ?) - dessert was characterized by one of our guest as same quality as Magnum ice cream . In short Over engineered French food with poor favour . Really a food experience to forget 
3
After all the great service, nice food and a fantastic dessert, why would one serve a Nespresso. Really a sad ending to a good experience. You want to end a good meal with a lovely double espresso and this is what is called cutting corners. Pls Saint Pierre - have a proper barista and good coffee
5
We recently celebrated my husband's birthday at Saint Pierre. We had a party of 30+ people and everyone was impressed by the service staff - very polite and prompt .. and our glasses were never empty. We had the 6 course Earth menu and the timing between courses was perfect, considering we had such a big group. From my perspective as a party organiser, the restaurant manager Julian and Chef Stroobant were very accommodating with the food choices and prompt to respond to my queries when I was doing my initial research on potential party venues. I had enquired at other top notch restaurants for the party venue such as Iggy, Cut, Spargo and eventually chose Saint Pierre due to their flexibility with my requests and of cos, the excellent food.Thanks Chef Stroobant and his staff for the perfect execution - we are likely to book out the restaurant again for group events in the near future 
5
Excellent service from the moment you walked in. Everything was tip-top. Loved the amuse bouche and dessert. The mains were crazy-good. Will be back again.
4
Quite an experience, driving to Sentosa Cove and finding this charming French restaurant helmed by Mr Stroobant, a stalwart of the Singapore culinary scene.This is the only place here in the prestigious, exclusive Relais et Chateaux list, and you can be assured of a wholesome, quality dining experience each time you visit.I recommend the champagne brunch here
5
If you want fine comfort food dining (modern french style) that won't burn a big hole in your wallet (or purse), this is the place to go. We've been there twice and have never been let down with it's fantastic service and food offerings. The food is done nicely with fresh ingredients, cooked with very innovative methods that can rival and michelin starred restaurants and presented in the most wow-ish way you can expect. I recommend skipping the ala carte choices and just dive straight into any of the menus and let the chef decide it for you.. it all taste nice anyway. And if you want a bit more indulgence on a Friday or Saturday.. go for the wine pairings too.. The wines they pair the dishes are just perfectly done. It's a pity that they seem to be doing some catering during this holiday period (Dec 2015) and won't be open for dining service except on Xmas and New Year's Eve.
2
We were last night and the food was very nice indeed. Unfortunately the wine was corked and the sommelier didn't even notice. Pretty poor I thought especially as the wine for $500 a bottle. Maybe that was the reason he still served it. Disappointing
4
My first visit this evening to St Pierre to celebrate my birthday turned out to be a wonderful and memorable experience. From reservation to walk-in, dine in and walk out. I only have 1 word to say : Impressed!The lamb shoulder and beef ribs are very tender. The best moment of the evening was the dessert!! The staff created the dessert live in front of us on our table. We will certainly go back again to St Pierre. Thank you for making my first visit so memorable
5
Okay, I've eaten at all the restaurants in Sentosa Cove with their wonderful boat harbor background and wharf. That alone is worth seeing. Many Sentosa Cove restaurants are very good. St. Pierre, however, is a unique restaurant you go to when you're not in a hurry and you want to eat many little dishes (small portions) of things or combination of things you've never tasted before. I got the "Discovery Menu" for $145 Sing. Wine totally complements all the dishes. ServiceSerServiYowserviceservice"personalized" service. The waiters are happy to explain the items with their unique nuances of flavor... A rarity nowadays
5
Unfortunately St Pierre was getting a bit jaded at the old location but since moving to Sentosa, Emmanuel Strobart has completely re-invented himself. The menu is completely different and has changed to be lighter, with Japanese influences and also probably taken on more vegetarian influences. Even then, for someone like me who feels like eating meat there is enough on the menu to make the trip worthwhile. It is probably worthwhile to come and try one of the set menus when eating at St Pierre. There are wonderful "snacks" at the beginning which was light and different. There are still wonderful meaty dishes like the foie gras appetiser which when paired with pineapple was very good. The other highlight is the chocolate soufflé desert - they intentionally made the portion gigantic so that diners would feel that they getting the real deal. The other reason to dine here is for the wonderful French sommelier. He makes little jokes throughout the meal and when one is dining with friends for a relaxing evening, his little jokes and comments just make the dinner a little bit more special.

As usual attentive service, picky wine list BUT a tasteless choice of ingredients for the truffle asparagus dish. An overcooked fish of the day in minuscule portion. Thanx God a delicious chocolate ice cream but not enough to prop up a disappointed overall prestation. Wake up Stroobant Team, nothing is ever set for ever. Will check again if magic is back again in a few months

Celebrity Chef Emmanuel is the Icon of this restaurant.From start to end it is a super culinary experience. The open kitchen offer you the behing the scene of the outstanding magic which wlil be placed in front of you. The presentation, taste and fragrance are complimenting each other.The view is stunning on hte Marina. The service is smoothless and personalised. A must go.

Good service! Menu was explained to us in detail. The cod main was melt in the mouth and tasty. Lamb main was tender altho abit gamey. Chocolate dessert was good but rhubarb one was abit sour. Will come back again

Saint Pierre is a stunning and modern french restaurant with a divine cuisine and beautiful interiors. A real culinary experience !

This place attracted with Chefs big name...But as food enthusiast we have been extremely disappointed. First of all the interior is very strange and inconsistent, you are really not sure what was the point behind it. personally felt like a kids club (if you are on a date, the place might not be the best choice).The menu is extremely limited. And full to put in frankly is not good, combination of flavours just does not work and I have tasted better beef ribs in the road side restaurants. All of it combined with the nice price tags just leaves you disappointed.One thing to mention service is exceptional, great attentive personnel but even it can not make up for whats lacking in food..
5
We've eaten here about half a dozen times. The food is fantastic and the wine pairings are equally so. The service is very good and often the chef will come out and say hello. The ambience is good and being on the second floor you get a nice outlook of Sentosa Cove. This is our favourite restaurant in Singapore.
5
Saint Pierre is a fantastic restaurant with both ambience and food to match. I sat at the chefs table and enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu (which turned out to be more like 12 with the amuse bouche). Which was my favorite course? I can't really say as each was such a visually delightful presentation as well as wonderful to savor. I really loved the turbot with fennel and edamame. But everything was equally tasty! It was such a treat being able to sit and be able to interact with the chefs as they completely explained each of their creative presentations. The staff there was amazing in how efficiently and professionally they all worked together. Chef Trevor was wonderful as was his entire staff. The wait staff was amazing as well. I no sooner finished one course that someone was there to take away my finished plate and replace my silver...almost without me noticing. This was a wonderful meal and experience that I will remember for quite some time

We were in Singapore in March this year thanks to last minute cancelled Future Music Festival Asia. Since we weren't hangover or exhausted over the weekend, we got plenty of time to explore the little island at our own pace. We drove to Sentosa Island and had brunch at Saint Pierre located at the swanky Quayside Isle. This modern French restaurant is helmed by the celebrity Belgian chef, Emmanuel Stroobant and we picked the place out of coincidence when we were having problem deciding a place for food. Big Teddy made the call to try this restaurant and we were glad that we found this place by chance.For S$38++ per person, their classic brunch menu comes with fresh watermelon juice, croissants, 1 choice of main (egg benedict/smoked salmon/beef parmentier) and coffee/tea. We also added 2 waffles at the end for S$14 & S$16 each. The service was top notch and the servers explained every dish professionally and make sure we never run out of water. It was a joy to see the chef in action in the open kitchen and we were extremely pleased with all the food. Honestly it's impossible to find fault with their food made with so high standards even with such simple menu. Definitely worth a splurge here at Saint Pierre when you are in Sentosa Island~

The Saint Pierre restaurant at Santosa quay side , has a superb view overlooking at hhe Marina and its sailboat and super yatch.The creativity of the chef for the food presentation, selection of ingredients and fine dining, still a touch of casual, make this place of my favorite restaurant in Singapore.Under the leadership of the owner Emanuel, a young singaporian, is a very talented chef. Great wine list too. reasonably priced. Try the sunday brunch too
5
Very yummy food and top class service. For starters we ate the Frog Legs n Escargots, it is very good. For my main, I pick the chicken. Another good choice. The bread n butter served at the start is also very fresh n good. A good restauran
5
this is probably the best food I have ever eaten linked with exquisite service from wonderful staff.My tips are try things that you thought you wouldn't like as you will be surprised, also order the wine taster menu to accompany the courses, in some places this is sold as a black art, the team here keep it simple and make great selections, going back again this weekend ! You won't be disappointed

Went to Saint Pierre twice, once in February and once in March. The setting is very nice, upstairs in Quayside Isle, with a very nice view overlooking the marina. No outdoor seating, which I think is good as the food and the dining experience would suffer from the heat, this is a French restaurant best experienced with air conditioning. The ambiance is nice, a little bit rustic and maybe a little self-depreciating for the quality of food served, however, in my mind this added to the appeal, there was none of the arrogance that you sometimes encounter in better restaurants, thisWe went for the degustation menu with wine both times, and it was an evening filling experience. The food was very varied, with French cuisine as the base, but many of the dishes surprised with fresh takes on known ingredients, sometimes taking you a little out of your comfort zone and afterwards being glad you did. The variety was excellent, on our second visit there were no repeat menu items from the first one. The wines were well matched and also added twists of their own, enhancing the overall experience considerably.Throughout the meal, the service was excellent, the best I had in Singapore, with the staff being perfectly attentive and carrying on a pleasant conversation throughout the evening.Overall, I can only highly recommend Saint Pierre, excellent food, excellent service, two of the best meals I ever had
5
It was great to have the chance to stop by for lunch during a 24 hour stop over coming home. Having been frequenting SP since 2007 (when in its old location) I'm a bit biased, but it was very nice catching up with Emanuelle and his team (Julien, Desmond and Mercy). The 48 hour sous-vide beef short rib was as good as I remembered it, with an excellent risotto and grilled vegetables. It was interesting to see the totally diferent character for a Mother's day lunch, compared to more usual dinner setting I have, and it had a very nice relaxed family atmosphere to it
5
The food is crazy good and the service fantastic too. These guys do some seriously interesting cuisine. Anyone going to Joel R should take a divert and come here instead.
5
Food is creative and yet still very appetising. The chef and sommelier are very friendly and helpful. Price quite reasonable for this expensive area.
5
Ours was a party of 16. Signature dishes eg foie gras were very good and the rest were alright. Attentive and friendly staff.
5
We have visited singapore several time over the past years and witnessed the massive changes in the F&B industry. After the opening of the integrated we had the pleasure to dine in many great restaurant but it seems that there are always space for more stars when it come to discovering new places. A friend recommended Saint Pierre in Sentosa and mentioned that it was one of the best meal he ever had. We visited the restaurant last week and we can only recommend it to anyone who is serious about food.Everything was amazing, the quality of food, the wines, the impressive cheese trolley, the deserts and the Petits fours!! A great experience, a friendly service and value for moneyâ€¦my vote for best french restaurant in Singapore
5
This is a must if you are in Singapore. Enjoy a leisurely evening and sample some amazing tastes with the well balanced menu. A special mention goes to the miso cod.We had three courses and all were spectacular, as were the sides. Unlike many restaurants, I struggled to choose each course (not because of any dislikes, but rather because I really wanted to try everything on the menu). There are clever, interesting twists without being overly adventurous to the point of too much. Finely balanced is the key to the food here.There is an extensive wine list and the service was professional but friendly. This is a restaurant for a pleasant night out if you want to treat yourself. We will be back again when next we are in Singapore
5
The food is Devine. We had an amazing meal and overall experience. Healthy delicious food served by professionals. We loved all the extra dishes courtesy of the chef. The miso cod was superb and lamb cutlets cooked perfectly. Make sure you order the mash....omg yum. We'll be back regularly as it doesn't get better than this in singapore. Even the vegetarian Indians at the table next to us were blown away with the food. You pay a little bit extra but at least you walk away knowing you had great creative food
5
We had a wonderful Valentine's dinner at Saint Pierre. Despite having already served lunch and an earlier seating, staff were friendly and helpful (if a bit rushed at the start!) - the atmosphere was relaxed, and the food was all amazingly delicious and beautifully presented. A perfect spot for a romantic special occasion
5
A fantastic experience !! Culinary very high level, beautiful ingredients used, staff have a lot of knowledge and love what they are doing = serving top food and do it with pleasure !The wine list is sensational. The only little minus point was for me the wooden chairs, which are not suitable for long dining.So at least put a cushion, PLEASE !
5
If you are looking for French cuisine with a twist, this is the place to go.. The ambience was just relaxing and rustic. Very dim-lighted which works to any woman's advantage. Maitre'D was attentive and informative. A little hard to find the place, hubby and i walked in circles before we found it. =D The food was pricey but all worth every single dollar and cent. It's not what you'd expect when you order but it's delightfully Delicio-BOMB!! We went "mmmm..oh my god this is good!" at every course. Chef's food was a piece of art. We will one day comeback for dinner, lunch whatever it is.. to Saint Pierre. Lovely! Couldn't ask for a more exquisite romantic anniversary dinner
5
I made reservations for Saint Pierre based on the Singapore Tatler's 2014 Best Restaurant Recommendations. Located next to the W Hotel Sentosa at Quayside Isle, we went a bit early before the first seating to enjoy the nice walk along Ocean Drive and take in all the luxury boats and homes. If you are taking a taxi, just have them drop you off at the W hotel, and you can also get a cab from the hotel for your return trip. We selected the 8 Course Degustation Menu with the wine accompaniment. The Tatler described Saint Pierre as having a Japanese influence, which I concur, but combined with the French cuisine Saint Pierre is a unique culinary experience for Singapore. The Cabillaud Au Miso is a house specialty, but the wine paring for that dish was an astonishing surprise. Really, how do you wine par for Miso; yet it was a challenge masterfully accomplished. There were many wonderful surprises to tantalise my tastes. The service was excellent, with well trained staff that were extremely attentive. I would recommend if possible to get first sitting so you can enjoy the view of the boats before the sun sets
4
very good food... fabulous wine list. Servings are unusually small even for fine dining, but the food is very flavoursome and beautifully presented
4
Booked this restaurant for our Christmas meal as it advertised having roast potatoes ! Lovely lunch with excellent service and David the manager was very friendly and helpful. Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Table wasn't quite ready when we arrived (early!) but we were still given a glass of champagne to enjoy. Lovely setting
4
This was a birthday dinner. It's in Sentosa so there is a $3 charge for vehicles entering the area. The restaurant is located upstairs from the marina with a lovely little walk along the marina. It's located next to the W hotel if the taxi driver can't find it. The seating feels very informal with large glass windows overlooking the marina. We opted for the 5 course table d'hôte. They also offer 8 and 12 course menus but the whole table needs to participate. There is also a la carte but the items on the 5 course menu were from the menu and so a better value at $128. We had the foie gras addition. The bread was good french bread served with cold butter in the shape of a snowman. The amuse bouche was quite tasty - duck and carrot puree. The most memorable plate was the miso cod wrapped in daikon slice. Apparently the chef changes up the condiments around this signature dish for the seasons but it always on the menu - yes, the chef came out to speak with us after the meal. The chocolate cake with fig ice cream was also delicious. I won't detail all the dishes as they do change. Service was prompt but not rushed, they would have let us linger longer. The wine pour was generous and we were definitely full after this meal. All in all, we enjoyed the meal. I'm not sure I'd make the trek back here to eat but it was a filling meal at a reasonable price and all the dishes were solid
5
Was there last week with a colleague and everything was delicious and the service was impeccable. I was amused by the "amuse" and having those asparagus as a starter was a great idea. I had the black cod (signature dish) and it was excellent. We both had wine by the glass and it perfectly suited the food. We were the only ones in the dining room for a bit since we started at 6:30 and could not understand why it was not more crowded. The chef/owner Emmanuel Stroobant came by as well to quietly ask how things were which was a very nice touch
5
This is a first rate restaurant, and a very personal one. I had the degustation menu (8 courses), not cheap, but better than fair value for the quality -- some of which was both sublime and witty. Plenty of "soil" liquid ice and so on... prawn cocktail with thousand island dressing, or the fois gras terrine both magical, and not at all looking what you much expect! Service mostly excellent, and the only course I wasn't keen on was the beetroot risotto, maybe my bias, but the trace of grit in the beetroot leaves shouldn't have been there! Speaking of what shouldn't be there, I just don't "get" Sentosa, but I guess 20 minutes in a cab is nothing to get steamed up about. This place is well and truly worth the journey. Ask for a window table if you like a view of the marina
2
Went with friends for a friend's bday celebration. There was another event in the next room which turned out to be very loud (the staff should have at least informed us upon us making a reservation but did not). The decor of the restaurant itself was nice and it had a good view of the marina. However, the food was very average, nothing special at all. But the price was expensive and averaged similar to other top restaurants in Singapore - though this one fails in comparison. The staff was also very average
4
My friend took me to this restaurant for Saturday lunch. I found this place is a sort of trendy spot among young wealthy people. Dishes are fashionably arranged French-Asian cuisine. I really enjoyed the food as well as interior decoration with modern arts.Also we enjoyed the view of marina. Highly recommended for lunch
5
The best fine dining experience at Quayside Isle. Service was fantastic and the food was delicious. I can recommend the classic degustation menu with matching wines....although it is a bit cheeky that there is additional charge for tea/coffee to finish. Great dinner choice if you at staying at the W (as we were) as it is very close
3
Excellent Food and owesome desserts but service is totally disappointing. All efforts made by chef and his team gets washed off by attitude of manager who seems to be overworking and has no respect for clients who are coming to restaurant to have lovely and memorable time with their family.
5
Myself and my fiancé took colleagues from work to dinner at Saint Pierre as we recently moved to Sentosa and had colleagues to our home first for drinks and then headed to the Quayside for dinner. The wine suggestions were delicious and we had two gorgeous bottles and fantastic meals. The views were lovely and it was nice that the restaurant was indoors but still had gorgeous harbour views. We will most certainly we back :
5
Excellent and fine food. This guy knows how to cook complex meals and get the best from the quality ingredients he is using.
The atmosphere is casual, but the service and the food is top notch.
5
Belgian chef Emmanuel Stroobant does magic in his kitchen. I just loved everything that was served. A Michelin star is only a matter of time.
5
I live nearby and went to St Pierre a week after they opened and hadn't been back since. It wasn't because we didn't like it, but because come the weekend we just want an extremely casual shorts and flip flops type of place. NOW I am wondering what was I thinking. The good thing about St Pierre is that you can go reasonably casual but also have excellent first class cuisine with superb service just a walk away - and the prices are actually reasonable considering what you get. In fact, I now feel compelled to support this place more because Sentosa would be a much worse place without it. With regard to some of the bad reviews, I suppose if one came from far away expecting some perfect formal French dinner you might be confused, but if one keeps their expectations in check and appreciates the wonderful creativity of food and the great service - in a lovely setting - you won't be disappointed.
5
On a recent visit to Saint Pierre all I can say is " excellent food and service" the front of house staff made us feel very special and relaxed from the moment we arrived nothing was too much trouble, we were given lots of attention and when ordering we were given a very detailed descriptions of the dishes which made everything sound amazing.Saint Pierre's food was of the highest standard for both taste combinations and presentation, I had Foie gras followed by Cod which I would recommend it was amazing! but we all tried and loved every dish of our party of 4, it was an excellent food experience one I would love to repeat one day Thank you all
5
At a loose end before a flight and not having been disappointed by the quality on offer elsewhere on this bit if sentosa i chanced on this place. The dishes are composed of various interesting ingredients that come together very well. The wasabi beef with olive soil and onion paper, the scallops and sea urchin with little soy jelly dots were fantastic as was the main course of beef. But what i also liked is that this is not 'fine dining' with stiffness from the service to the tablecloths. The staff were kind, very knowledgable about the high quality wine list and exude enthusiasm for their chef. Others on here have talked of half a roof tile to put your bread on or upset that they arent treated as though they were in france in 1965. But thats to miss the point if this place. Beautifully cooked food using combinations of ingredients you wont be offered elsewhere in an informal and calm environment. And top end wines by the glass rather than overpriced junk.
5
Location: Sitting next to W-Hotel sentosa facing the quay. Ambience: It is more like a semi-formal French restaurant without the super formal white table cloth settings. Nevertheless the ambience still looks poise and elegant, the serving staffs are very professional dressed in their nice black jackets but very approachable too.Food and wine selections: Food was fantastic! Just like any other french restaurants the food are perfect at their taste and presentation. Wine list are very food friendly wine you can always order different glasses of wine by the glass to go very well with your food, or if you don't want to have a whole bottle for all the food They also serve half bottle (375ml )wine too. 10/10 for the food and wine pairing:we had Sea Urchin, Scallop in Yuzu zest; and sushi, tuna belly, scallop dust for starter. Main was the special Wagyu; steamed atlantic lobster with sauternes emulsion. Belgium chocolate cake with earl grey ice-cream for desert.. Hm..Will come back again! Good for special family occasion, romantic dates, or to wow your business clients

Went here to celebrate good friends leaving Singapore. It wasn't our choice. The TA reviews of this place are a split between love and hate so we were genuinely interested to see what it had to offer being that we love French food and this markets itself for fine dining. Where to start ? We had a table with no view, plastic seats, no tablecloth, no cutlery and a broken roof tile as a side plate. We all ordered the Classic Tasting Menu of 5 courses paying the supplements for the pan fried foie gras, matched wines and cheese course. The amusee bouche was some asparagus with carrot foam (tasteless); foie gras (over cooked and the promised sharpness of the apple not obvious); blackened cod (very good but minuscule portion); wagyu beef (way overcooked) and a small chocolate tasteless sponge pudding. The wines served with each course were OK. The cheese was good and a bottle of port helped was away the memory of the preceding dishes. The staff were sullen but denied it when I highlighted to Emmanuel Stroobant (Head Chef and owner who walked the tables later). I told him honestly that the meal was only OK. The bill was around $650 per couple (without the bottle port and champagne we bought) which I'm still in shock about considering how completely underwelming the evening was. Considering this guy also owns Brussels Sprouts and Picotin here on Sentosa you would be well advised to eat there which is better food and a third of the price or find one of the many better French restaurants in Singapore.
3
For a Relais and Chateaux Grand Chef this was a very ordinary meal. We really expected some fine French dining. The lighting was such that you could not see out across the marina which must be a major asset for the restaurant. I think there as just one other couple there o the place lacked atmosphere. Table setting was weird with a rectangular piece of concrete brick as a bread and butter plate and a wooden plate on the table with a cocktail spoon resting on it. Heavens knows how they handle the health and hygiene part of table setting. Writing this only 7 days after being there the starter was so unimpressive we have forgotten what we ate and the main courses, my wife had the blackened cod with looked and tasted delicious and I had the poached lobster with rock vegetables. Well the vegetables did look like rocks and they were halfed cooked so they were as hard as rock also. The plate presentation of the lobster could have been done by a three year old. we are amazed just how this guy still qualifies as a R&C Grand Chef. we reckon he needs to get back to Europe for some refresher courses. Sorry Chef, but that is was on the night.
5
Ate here twice on 29 March while staying at the W to celebrate my birthday with my wife. We first enjoyed a very nice Saturday brunch of smoked salmon on toast for me and avacado and tomato on toast for my wife (and that was not even on the menu so really nice if them to do that for us) plus a bottle of Perrier-Jouet Rose for $130, total bill came to $195. Not bad for Singapore and a really nice light lunch. Staff were excellent as well, especially the young French guy.Decided to take a look at the dinner menu and chose to come back that night for the ten course degustation ($150) with wine pairings ($100).The dinner was wonderful with each course a new delight. The food was a real treat and the wine was also very good.Our only disappointment was that we only got one red wine. This surprised us as we had expected more reds like other degustations we've done. Also we generally prefer red wines at dinner. If we go back we will clarify our wine preference at the start of the meal or perhaps when making our reservation.Also, please offer tea or coffee at the end of the meal as part of the degustation. I was quite surprised after spending $250 on my meal that I had to pay additional money for tea/coffee at the end. Total bill for dinner with tax and service charge (and no extras like coffee) was $580 for two people.
5
Saint Pierre is our local French resto, we eat here about twice a month and there is nothing bad on the menu! Wines are also great, reasonable price for their labels and the selection of half bottles is great for people who want to try various bottles :-)I mention relaxing because there is no dress code and zero attitude, which is a refreshing change from most high end restaurants in SG.
5
Me and my wife went for a romantic evening and we definitely got our money's worth.
Great food. Amazing food. Decedent and delicious, very romantic and the service is out of this world.
Don't miss the chef's tasting meal, it's devine.
5
An absolutely faultless meal.
Really interesting food, amazing quality and very swift service.
Would definitely recommend for a great time
5
Great French dinning experience at reasonable prices (relative). Reminds me of good 1 and possibly 2star Michelin restaurants in France
1
Website was kinda appealing..Had our holiday in SG, stayed in sentosa and tried this restaurant since its close from our hotel.Went on this "BRUNCH" thing ala carte style. 3 literally SMALL pieces of bread for 15 dollars. And nothing so special on that. You could almost see it in bakeries everywhere and a bland egg benedict..they got view though but the food is horrible. Overall,, i wont recommend it. Not worth the money
5
I visited this restaurant because this is the one and only Relais & Châteaux member restaurant in Singapore. What I tried was their 10-course degustation menu, and I am so delighted this restaurant joined Relais & Châteaux otherwise I couldn’t find them. Grand Chef Emmanuel Stroobant’s dishes are serious artworks, very impressive presentations as well as the tastes! Chef Emmanuel used some Japanese materials in very subtle amount, which is just a hint and hard to identify. Every single dish has its exquisite, meticulous presentation hence I was impressed every time the dish was set in front of me. I refrain from explaining the details of dishes I was served… I don’t have right words, actually. Wine list is crazy long if you think this place is under equator. Unfortunately I visited here alone so I could try some by a glass, but they still have enough variety of wines sold by the glass. Servicepersons are incomparable too. David, their Maître de Maison, was very polite and kind, served my wines. Another serviceperson Desmond is very friendly yet polite, he took care of me everything I needed. Other servicepersons were also very polite and kind as well. When I fly over Singapore again, I will definitely book my table prior to my departure thru Relais & Châteaux Club 5C. Thank you!
3
Made a trip there and I definitely expected much more (maybe cuz it was my birthday) andthey didn't live up to their hype. I vaguely remembered paying a visit to St Pierre about 3 to 4 years back when it was still at Clarke Quay area and it didn't disappoint! :(Their 10 course degustation lasted for 4 hours....we almost froze to death too.Full review up on: http://unveiledlust.blogspot.sg/2013/12/birthday-dinner-at-st-pierre.htm

My group of friends & I went to Saint pierre for lunch recently. We felt that the quality of the food and ambience were alright, though nothing spectacular. However, we felt the quality of service staff could be further improved. One of the waiters (probably a relatively inexperienced one) accidentally spilled orange juice onto my friends shirt. (The stains couldn’t be removed and unfortunately it was a white shirt) We had the impression that he was trying to bend down to pick something up from the floor while carrying a tray full of glasses containing fruit juice. We understand spilling the orange juice was purely an accident, but we think that it could have been better managed - We didnt receive any proper apology from the restaurant that was deem fit for a reputable eatery like them. We hope that service standards can be improved to make the dining experience at Saint P a better one in future
1
Went for a birthday celebration. Can't fault the food or service but the ambience wasn't great and the restaurant doesn't seem to know if it is very high end (in which case I would expect tablecloths and more formal place settings) or if it is a hotel coffee shop.There were families with young children, albeit well behaved. But do you want to pay a lot of money for a quiet dinner whilst the children at the next table play with their toys? Also the building has high open ceilings and the acoustics are terrible. Over-priced and not worth another visit. Note: The new address is:Quayside Isle, Sentosa
4
The address details above aren't exactly up to date. The restaurant has been located in Quayside Isle, just near the W Hotel on Sentosa since the end of May 2013, and has a pleasant view over the Marina from the first floor. Belgian chef Emmanuel Stroobant presides over the French menu with some spectacular dishes. We ordered a la carte, but on our next trip to Singapore would be very tempted to try the degustation. There were three standout dishes - foie gras with caramelised apple and a port sauce, the braised Angus beef short rib and a chili chocolate ganache with kir royale sorbet. So good. Can't wait to get back there
5
My family had a great dinning exprience in August 2012. We ordered the degustation menu which was fanastic. The duck breast was the best that I ever had. The wine pairing was excellent. It was not only about the quality of the wine itself but the impeccable matching of the wine to the food. I could truly experience the blissful marriage of wine and food that night!Kudos to the chef and the staff. Having said that, great experience comes with great price tag..
5
Just you might thought, you'll find here the renown quality of a Relais & Chateaux member restaurant. It's European inspired dishes are pleasure for the palate. This gem of culinary arts it's a safe bet on the Singapore dining stage.
2
For many years, this was a highlight of my frequent trips. But the last time I went there will BE the last.
To be brief, the quality has plunged almost as much as the prices have risen.
Adieu, Pierre.
5
Have been to this top resturant 3 times over past couple of years.It keeps getting better and chef/owner now has 6 restaurants in Singapore.As I said above this is a special evening place,try the tasting menu with matched wines.Staff are fabulous.
4
Consistently good food and ambience. The owner is a Singapore institution, and always friendly and helpful
3
In a few words: good service but very slow ( more than 3h for lunch). Food is good, especially cod fish but portions are just so so small. Good value for lunch but a la carte dinner or menu is just overpriced.
5
My wife and I have been lucky enough to visit Singapore several times these past few years and on many occasions we have eaten at Saint Pierre, one of several restaurants owned and operated by the friendly and capable Emmanuel Stroobant.Saint Pierre is a small, tastefully decorated restaurant, tucked away off the tourist walking path.We have eaten both prix fixe lunches and a la carte dinners.We ate dinner there just under 2 weeks ago, on a quiet night, with impeccable service and top quality food.Between us we had some carpaccio followed by tasty main courses, but the highlight would have been the extra little tastings provided to diners. We had a very interesting smoky tomato foam soup and at the end we were given small onion-flavoured ice-cream cones in a bed of chocolate soil.Fortunately we had room for the superb cheese platter, although I could not get my favourite (Kraft cheddar slices - just kidding) and I found the extra energy to drink a very smooth framboise eau de vie. I tasted the plum first, but opted for the framboise
5
Decided to splash out for my birthday, four of us booked with an open mind as to what to expect.Service was excellent and attentive without being over the top.The meal itself was excellent and the idea of different tastings complemented by reaonable wines worked very well.OK it was not cheap but for a special occassion it is worth tryin
5
I was one of the first customers, more than a decade ago, and since then I've returned at least once a year.What I find amazing is that not only has the quality never declined, but it's gone from brilliant to stupendous!This time, the not over-long tasting menu was the choice, with accompanying wines chosen by the charming and amusing head waiter. The sense of theatre, and dare I say it, self-mocking irony, is a joy! The staff are a delight. We laughed and yummed our way through the lot...can't wait to return
2
the service was very slow star at 8 until 12.30 !!!!! the food was good but next time a bite hot is better, I miss the head chef is not any more Stroobant so maybe is that the problem. when you are not on your kitchen some problem come very quick so I want to said good food, good staff but emmanuel need to come back and this kitchen. Brussels sprouts was very good and great staff congrat !!
5
I decided to spoil my gf with a personalised menu at St. Pierre for her 30th birthday. Having specifically requested for the first two bespoke courses, I left it up to Jan and his team to choose the main and dessert. The warm welcome and escort into the restaurant was followed by chilled champagne, a unique box of tidbits and a tastebud-exciting amuse bouche. The first course of seasonal white asparagus, poached egg and black truffles was not up to the high expectations we had set which we politely fed back to Jan. Expectantly awaiting the signature foie gras next, we were surprised to be presented with an enormous dish of king scallop carpaccio, each thick slice separated by generous slices of fragrant black truffles. Perhaps one of the most amazing dishes we have ever had the pleasure of tasting. The fois gras, delayed to accommodate our truffled seafood extravaganza, did not disappoint and was perfectly seared.Low temperature sealed veal tenderloin with an array of accompaniments, tepenades and reductions was sublimely complex and testament to the kitchen's culinary skills. Grandma Stroobant's flourless Belgian chocolate cake wrapped up the dinner superbly. However, it was simply impossible to skip a sliver of gum-tingling cheese from the extensive cheese trolley washed down with the obligatory port and to bring our meal to an end, the final petite fours. As a final hoorah to our sublime evening we were presented with a bound commemorative menu and an assortment of other goodies.The night to remember came at a price but given the exemplary service, divine food and overall holistic experience was worth every cent

One of the best in town. Tried their beef ribs before, highly recommended as well.

It's a very posh place and the service was not good at all. The food was nothing's special. We didn't like the atmosphere, so quiet and dull.

french nouvelle at its best. love the pre-meal nibbles, the scallops done in diff ways, the asparagus salad

We were seated at 8:00 pm and the 9th course was served at 12:30 am. This incredible longevity was amplified by the dreadful gastronomic experience. The staff were veneer deep polite, but ignorant. When questioned they ran away to seek answers, but never came back. The accompanying wines were dreadful. The sommelier when queried about the wines responded “I don’t really know anything about wines...” Do I need to say more

Grossly overrated although Beef ribs are excellent. Service leaves a lot to be desired. Prices are on the high side but they do have a variety of FOC "amuse-bouches" in between courses, making it unnecessary to order too many courses to feel satiated unlike in other French restaurants

I have been there for a business dinner.I found the dishes very tasty and the cuisine was elaborated and very french at the same time. I had some very interesting taste combination during my meal.The dorade a la croute de sel was perfectly cooked, and the fish tasted fantastic.The wine list is well done, the service is friendly and not too invasive, just a bit slow but I guess it also the charme of those places.The bar outside is nice to finish the meal with a digestif and for the smokers to smoke their cig.The bill isn't very high for such a high standard restaurant, I was gently surprised.Overall I spent a delicious moment from the begining to the end.A place to go, definitly

We were two couples dining at St.Pierre mid January.Once you enter the restaurant the athmospere/design/ambience is very nice and thought through. I'm not a master in fine dining, but waiting about 20minutes for a drink and wine list, and a further 10-15minutes for the first drink to be served I found surprising.We asked about 3 times for the drink list before it came. I'm not sure, but considering they aplogized the delay while several waiters stood around I think they might not have had enough menus.There was alot of amazingly good and small complimentary dishes included, which we really liked. This included amongst other things several types of bread, some fried sardines, raw shrimps and chocolates in the end. All very nice and exclusive.For the starters we had quail, paoched egg and ham and also the frog legs. All very good and well prepared. We where however not as happy with the mains in which we first had the rabbit that was very tender but a bit tasteless. Then two of us had the roasted venison which was very boring and tasteless, while the last person had the pigeon, which was amazing (we all tried each others dishes).Desserts where all very good as they would be in any french restaurant, but they where served quite late and again I had two remind them about my cappucino which took in the region of 20minutes to get.The girls where however very happy about the cosmo's which they concluded was the best ever tasted in Singapore.The whole thing cost us just under 200sd each including taxes and service charge, that is considering 1 bottle of wine and about 2 drinks each. The 5 course meal (which the claim to be fixed price but it isn't) took us about 3 hours to finish (!) so set off plenty of time.I would say the restaurant is worth the try, but next time I will go for the lunch menu or just drinks by the bar

We have been twice, both times for lunch and each time have had the special lunchtime menu (great value at $S28, $38 and $48 for 2, 3 or four courses respectively)The menu, even for the lunchtime special menu, is varied and the food is so good. Small portions but the tastes are exquisite.Nice touches are the ameuse bouche (an espresso cup of frothy soup, capsicum last time, smoked tomato today) and the small sweet things which accompanied the coffee (neither charged for). The soup was subtle and accomplished its task of awakening the palate with subtle smoky flavours.Highlights today were a zucchini flower stuffed with tiger prawn and scallop, accompanied with a lovely butter lemon infusion which provided an excellent balance to the dish.The foie gras ( +$S8 ) was also fantastic, crisp on the outside, creamy in the middle and brilliantly complemented by the old port sauce.The wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. (If you are from overseas please be aware that these prices are very good for Singapore where wine is heavily taxed). We thoroughly enjoyed a Majella sparkling shiraz from South Australia which added a further dimension to the amazing flavours this menu provides.Service is attentive, thoughtful and definitely not stuffy.They also have several degustation and an a-la-carte menus which we have not tried but which also look worthy

Being a bit of a foody, I've been looking forward to going to this restuarant for ages. While there are major highlights on the degustation menu (the house specialty is amazing) there were huge lows too. Service is A++ and it was a thrill to see Emanuel Strooband walking in and out of the kitchen (cool to know it's more than just his name on the door). the atmosphere too was a lot better than what I was expecting from the outside. TThis is a restuarant you've got to experience at least once, but in a city known for it's amazing food on every corner, the price could be a bit off putting
5
One of very favourite dining places. The food is always spot on, and Edina and Emmanuelle are simply wonderful hosts.

The set lunch menu is good value. Celeriac soup & Miso Cod are very nice.

Overrated - esp since foie gras is foie gras

I dined here as a solo diner, a young lady far from home on a business trip. The reservation process was very friendly (over email), and the host of the restaurant was very cordial about giving directions and seating me early (I was hungry and bored...).The waiter who was my initial server (no consistency, they all kept switching up) was very pleasant and understanding of my situation. However, the waitstaff at the Saint Pierre clearly have nothing better to do than hover about in the dining room, staring at diners and whispering to each other. One in particular, a curly redhead, seemed to find me and my lonely situation quite funny.The chef was an angel, and he sent out little nibbles of this and that. Plus, he came out personally and said hello and asked about my meal. The foie gras was perfectly done, and the old port sauce that came with it was fantastic. I was also given a nice salad on the side and a couple of creative bread choices.I did notice that the wait staff (particularly the redhead) chatted up the couples dining there, yet no one came over to have a conversation with me. I guess when I'm spending half of what other tables are, I must be like a leper in their restaurant.I have never been made to feel so bad as a diner ever. If you read my other reviews, I've really never gone on like this. I think that this restaurant has a lot to offer.....just as long as you aren't dining alone

St. Pierre is simply the best, in my opinion. I first went here a few times in 2000/2001 when I was living in Singapore and I have eaten here twice again since returning here this year. I have been living in HK/Sing since 1995 and have wined and dined around the region (ex. Japan) and nothing is as good as this. The one that comes closest (but doesn't quite top it) is Caprice at the Four Seasons in HK. Chef Emmanuel Stroobant has got a bit more experimental in that time and the menu seems to have shifted a little from the signature foie gras dishes for which he was originally known, but it's all gone in the right direction. Both times I have been there this year, we went for the Degustation menu with matching wines. Total bill including the wine, and a cheese supplement, tax and service, was S$500 (US$330) for two, but yes, I still think this is good value for a wonderful evening. We ended up having 10 tasting courses, plus the cheese, and everything was sensational - I love cooking but have no idea how he constructs some of these things. The intensity of the sauces/reductions is amazing. And yes, with the degustation you still get the chance to sample the foie gras. I have recommended this restaurant to lots of people over the years - it's not been that well known about in the past - and everyone who has been there loves it (although I do forewarn on price). Great service too. Wins hands down

We went on a bit of a splurge here - had the Prix Fixe menu and added onto that. Everything was delicious except for the mains! To be honest, we probably ordered poorly as it was the type of food we eat at home. The Wagyu beef was $100 and it was good, but we live in Australia, where Wagyu beef is raised! The trout and truffles - $70 - was ok - admittedly I dont have that quality of truffles at home, but still, I was slightly underwhelmed... when you pay $170 for a main alone you expect magic, but it was still good. The rest was delicious - desert is my thing that makes or breaks the dining experience and I had Grandma Stroobands flourless chocolate cake - it was very good. The fun here is trying to break down what a the mystery ingredients in the courses - apple, vanilla, pate and other yummy unexpected ingredients that pop up. Emmanuel Strooband was a very polite host and came to have a chat to each guest. I think the Maitre D thought we were a bit common for his taste, but the rest of the staff were lovely and helpful. Expect some posers and everytime someone walks in you will check them out to see what they are wearing and if they are famous, but all that aside, (and that is fun anyway) I would recommend

After reading so many comments of this restaurant, I went there with my friends and bring along a Cheval Blanc 2003 for the occasion. The food is fusion type and the products that chef cook Emmanuel Stroobant used are fresh of the day. His dishes presentations are superb and the service is high standard. Compared to Raffles and Les Amis, I would rate Raffles the best and Les Amis the least. Value wise Saint Pierre is expensive as I came out still hungry after spending more than $1000 dollars for 6 which does not include our bottle of Cheval Blanc. Compared to French restaurants in DC where I came from, Saint Pierre is definitely over rated and at least twice as expensive. I cannot understand why it has received the qualification of Relais & Chateaux reserved only for the best in the world

Let’s talk about the Degustation Menu!I just got back from dinner at Saint Pierre. It was a wonderful experience.I was there with my wife for our 3rd wedding anniversary. We both took the 8 course Degustation Menu. This includes a complimentary selection of house breads, sorbet, & a sweets sampler. We added a cheese selection of 3 different cheeses, which we chose from the cheese cart of no less than 15 cheeses. This Degustation Menu has a Foie Gras course. However, as my wife no longer eats Foie Gras (due to her ethical views) there was no problem substituting it with another course. She really enjoyed her meal and said, “French kitchen is not only about Foie Gras, just like Chinese kitchen is not only about Shark’s Fin Soup.”Emmanuel’s Degustation Menu was a fusion of French kitchen and Japanese/Asian. He has found a unique & delicate balance between these two kitchens, which made it a great dinning experience. He even added a twist of molecular cooking to the Menu!As his menus change with the seasons, I will definitely make it a point to come back to try the new creations Emmanuel will be coming up with.If you go for the Degustation Menu do make a point to try the wine accompaniment. It will really enhance the dining experience.I just say, “Ever had Sparkling Sake?” ;) You must try it, especially the one from Ichinokura (Miyagi Prefecture)

i am a very fortunate person: i travel the world following my husband.Last week end we went to Saint Pierre with a couple of friends and i was really surprised by the new look of the restaurant as well as the new menu.I am not a food critic and have no intention of writing about food, but i had a fantastic experience and wanted to share it. it wasclassy, trendy, fun, friendly...the food was perfect and the total bill....for $88.00 per person...i find my new cantine

I have had some ok to very good experiences at Saint Pierre in the past. And towards the end of last year, the experiences were border-lining on ok more than good. However, with the renovations, I think Saint Pierre can finally call itself a world class restaurant. In the past the ambiance was ok but the service and food mostly made up for that. And occasionally the innovativeness in the menu tended to have a more negative than positive effect. After the extensive renovation, and it is extensive, i did not recognize the interior at all, the ambiance had increased by leaps and bounds. The service is back to being sleek and friendly and the newly added bar makes a huge difference in the entire dining experience. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and had a really fun time sampling their not so conventional cocktails. By the time we adjourned to our table, I was pleasantly buzzed. The food was simple yet tasty. With their new 5 course set dinner at $88 per person, and you could choose from the entire ala carte menu, it was very affordable. What made our evening perfect was their extensive wine list at very reasonable prices. We ordered a 1990 bordeaux that was slightly over $100. With the savings that we made on the wine i decided to splurge and have the beef, you had to add $60 to the fixed priced, and it was an additional $60 that was well spent. The beef was juicy and full of flavour. Most places tend to offer filet, much as it is a very tender cut, i always find the flavours lacking. Plus I like the idea of having to chew my beef. This was perfection especially with the piece of foie gras wrapped into it. All in all it surpassed all our expectations

Foie gras not bad... food generally expensive for what it is...

The ambience is like any European dining establishment. Service is impeccable. Food is a let-down. The signature dessert of Flourless chocolate cake is too moist. It should be delectable.

Emmanuel Stroobant never fails to lift up spirits with his exquisite pairings of French fusion food. THE place to go for foie gras in Singapore.
