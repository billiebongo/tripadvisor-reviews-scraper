food is average but the spread could be better, like have the Mexican cuisine back. Service is good.
3
Lamb meatball pasta was yummy. The meat platter is value for money.
The steak however was not well seasoned. And I dont think the lemon yuzu drink is nice.
4
the food at FIX was more than satisfactory and the price was rather value for money. only thing was the atmosphere and location, which wasn't what i had expected. it's an outdoor setting with fans by the poolside.
3
Got the chicken waffle, pretty alright, nothing spectacular. Slightly soaked in greased and the sides weren't anything special.

I read some pretty awesome reviews online and wanted to try this place near Zhong Shan park. Plus, I find those restaurants on Chope very decent.Great service! The staff were very helpful, smiley and prompt on service.Upon seated, i was given an old menu which was falling apart. There was a decent selection but the quality was not desirable, except for the salted egg fries (saving grace!). There was supposed to be some bbq on Fridays but i did not see any. This visit was a disappointment. The bill came up to slightly more than $60 for both of us.I asked the husband if he would go Fix Grill again and we decided that that will be our last visit
2
Perhaps because the manager was not present.. A grp of young workers managed the restaurant. They were laughing their hearts out and did not notice us at the entrance of restaurant. When we went to counter to take order (the 1st time we went there.. There was a worker who came to our table to take order), we were told that some of the drinks were not available. We only had 1 choice of cooler left (why never inform earlier before we order?). So we all chose the same cooler and they got a shock (like isn't it expected.. We don't have much of a choice in the 1st place). Some of us ordered steak.. Medium rare. Turned out the steaks were not evenly cooked. Some parts were still raw. We actually went there for the steak because the 1st time we went was really good.. The steak was superb. Very disappointing this time ard coupled with poor service.

My girlfriend and I went to Fix for brunch. I had a Fried chicken waffle burger, which was delicious, unique and cheaper than another restaurant I visited. The place doesn't have air con and even though it was beside the pool, it was still extremely hot. It's also pretty out of the way but a good novel experience overall
5
My husband and I have been visiting Fix since it started, the old menu had more attractive selections. But the burger we had from the new menu is delicious, we have ordered it 3 times and probably more to come. We ordered it without the sambal onion jam, the fries were good as well. The sticky date pudding was very good too. There were some disappointments in service.. last order is at 845pm but none of the staff informed us, so when we made a new order for dessert at 850pm we were told the kitchen was closed. There is a lack of attention to service and the staff do not smile.
4
If you are looking for a place that has a pretty good ambience, not pricey, decent food - here it is. It's not overly crowded now, the hype has died down. Food is not ultra-mega-fantastic but it's worth what you pay for; doesnt burst your budget. The male servers gotta be more attentive though. Ordered a coke float but only served the coke...i paid $4 more for the ice cream mind you! Haha
3
The location is conducive. The place is nice and quiet with the swimming pool beside. Customer service is good. There is an area specially for private function. However, I feel the food need to be elevated. The steak is good, but I find the waffles with chicken and the fish and chips are normal standard
2
Food is average. Menu has changed. Not much of variety.
Apparently, the chef changed.
Good service from the staff tho.
4
Nicholas (the guy that was serving us) was awesome & had an excellent service.. Friendly & happy-go-lucky guy.. Thumbs up!!
2
It was not very nice , the pasta was dry and it was tasteless but the fish as chips was not bad. The burger and the soup was also not very nice.
4
This was where i first brought my date for our first meal together. And year after year we came back to this place.
5
Great service rendered by the Muslimah staff (sorry I didn't catch your name!) Food wasn't too bad and I enjoyed my time there :)
3
Usual chic hangout with normal prices for Western cafes. Would recommend for brunch and lunch.
Instagrammable dishes with good lighting - especially dessert.
Personally, with the new menu, it's overall mediocre. Fix didn't shine to me
5
The place is set beside the pool of the club house and is a nice view of the pool to enjoy your meal. Order waffles fried chicken and was pleasantly pleased with the fried chicken pieces with the waffles. Had the rainbow cake too an dit was nice and fluffy with the cream cheese frosting which added a nice touch
2
I hated the new menu, bring back the old menu because you guys stand out from the rest. Whatever you have now on the menu is just basic, I must say the salted egg yolk cheese fries was the only outstanding I had, my mains was just bad. Nothing special. I can tell you other places who serves better and a a cheaper rate. Enough of that. So how do you guys improve...? Bring back you old menu and have this menu too, and you see which is better.To add on, I am rating you guys poor and not terrible because of the great service rendered to my family. The most saddest part of it all, it was a part of our mothers day celebration. We went home full, but not happy at all
3
While the food is okay (can do with more variety), the prices are good and the service is impeccable. Very patient accommodating and friendly. By far one of the best service crew I've encountered in far too long. The chief service crew Miss Widya was a good leader who led by example.
2
It was a disappointment to have travelled there to try something new as to celebrate my girl 14th birthday. Atmosphere...nothing like what I saw in FB or website.Menu looked old. No lamb shank as stated in the website. We were the last family & no waiter came to take our order so we thought that we had to order and pay straight away. At the counter, the guy apologised.These are the food we ordered.Crispy turkey bacon pasta $13Meat platter - mashed potato - Coles law $16 (nothing special at all)Peri2 lamb meatball pasta $14Cheesy chicken chop$13 (not cheesy at all)Club burger $15 (really a dissatisfied. The meat & the pathetic vegetables in it) I Am & The LAB serve good burgers.Prices rounded off.Mocha at $4.90 in a small cup. SWENSEN serves better Mocha.The food not value for money
4
First time here and it was an awesome experience! Came here for my 23rd birthday dinner with the family...ambience was lovely...food was great and the cakes were delicious! Wld definitely come back for moreðŸ˜Š
4
The food is delicious and the atmosphere is quite peaceful. The staffs are well trained also. The location is just a bit difficult to find.
4
The cafe was small and cozy, and surprisingly not that crowded on a weekend. It was breezy as it was located next to a pool, which helped a lot during the afternoon. The food was priced at cafe prices and decent!
4
Receive a free complimentary drink from the staff, taste of food is great but the varieties have been decreasing.
2
Food was not up to expectation. Steak was too dry, pasta was only average, nothing special. Perhaps the ambience would make customers to come to cafe but not the food
4
The staff at FIX were very friendly. Food was served faster than expected. However, the food in the menu was rather limited.
3
New menu looks limited in choices, no special dish stands out. Slightly oily for pasta. Halal certified. Very friendly staffs
3
I picked this place for my brother's birthday because he's Muslim and it's a halal restaurant. The main draw was that it served Mexican food, or at least some fusion-y Mexican cuisine. But when I got there, first of all, they didn't have my reservation. Which was fine, possible a system problem on Chope's end and the place managed to get a table for us anyway. The second bit was that Fix no longer serves Mexican food! My brother and I were dumbfounded by the menu, just full of the typical "western" food that many generic restaurants in Singapore have. The sign outside still said "Mexican" and I'd picked the place based on a recommendation from a halal food blog. I checked with the waitress and she said they'd changed the menu to "western" recently. I can't compare it to what they used to serve since I never tried it but what we had wasn't the best either. They were alright fare, what you would expect from a lot of the typical restaurants here. Serviceable, basically with pastas suited to a local taste and meats that have been drenched in too-sweet sauces. I'd say skip the sugar fries with salted egg mayo, that was a strange concoction and I should've known better. Sugar on fries did not make sense. Pity about the food, it's really a nice place. The cake we had was quite tasty so there's another plus. It will do in a pinch I suppose, if you're nearby and you're terribly hungry, but I would not make a trip especially to eat here.
4
We went on the last day of operations by the old management of FIX therefore many food and drinks are not available. That was disappointing as we had purchased a $50 chope voucher. We ordered the lasagne, buffalo wings, basil pasta and chilli cheese fries. Lasagne and wings were good. Pasta was mediocre and fries were not fantastic.Might return to see what the management have to offer in terms of menu and quality
2
Service was great & ambience is nice (open air, by the pool) but sadly, the food is nothing to rave about. Me & hubs picked this place for our date night coz it was rated one of the top Halal cafes when we googled but we ended up feeling disappointed coz for the quality of food we got, we thought it was rather overpriced. Apparently, it's said to serve Mexican fare but we didn't see anything Mexican on the menu except the chilli beef fries which were mediocre at best. The hubs had the wild mushroom soup which was so smoothly blended that there was nothing wild about it. He also ended up ordering plain old fish & chips which was exactly that, plain & bland. I had the spicy drumsticks which were basically frozen drumsticks (that I could have bought from the supermarket) that were drizzled with some sambal. Maybe, we should have ordered their famed toasties, but we just didn't feel like having bread for dinner
4
Second time here and the food + service still impresses me, although the shrimp pasta could have done with less oil.
5
We are alte but they kept our reservations. Service was wonderful, despite us having alot of questions, staffs enetertained us with a smile. It was our friend's birthday, they even offered complimentary rainbow cake! My friends love the place and we will definitely come back
5
I am truly satisfied with their service and it makes us feel the enjoyment of food and the environment
4
the staff were helpful especially Doreen who called in and check the reservation and gave ideas for birthday surprise
5
Good place for all, like the poolside seats but it is non-air conditioned and may not be good for dining on a hot day.
4
I have not been to hometeam NS for awhile. If it's not for the court n facilities, would not have realize this place. First the price is really affordable.The mushroom soup is different n amazingThe lemon earl gray tea is really nice.So is the pesto pasta n fries.Fish can be better.Service is good too.Nice ambience.Thanks
2
It's not my first time at Fix so I was utterly disappointed to know they have revamped their menu to some Mexican theme. I had some cornflakes crusted chicken that was over-fried and was extremely dry on the inside. I really hope they will revisit their offerings
4
Seems to have too many sweaty kids with taekwondo uniform around, I guess lunch after lessons. I am sure noise could be kept lower.  It seems understaffed when I went there as I saw 2 staff running around serving, payment and making drinks. Thumps up to them Fish and chips was good, the fish was really a huge portion, seems generous (I hope they can be generous the next time I come over). We also went for the spicy drumlets, which was not as expected. Seems to be a spicy chili blachan on top of drumlets. we also had the cakes as they were having the promotion, a piece cost $5. Does not seems to taste fresh.
3
As summarised by the title. Food here is so-so. Not worth the hype. I've been here twice, before and after they revamp their menu. Even after they revamp the menu, the food was just average. Service was poor too, they seem understaffed and most of the time, they were unattentive.
3
The food was simple yet delicious. The problem with Fix is that there aren't enough service staff. Don't get me wrong, all of them are friendly and competent. But they are clearly overworked because I cannot even find them to order more food. Service needs to be worked on for sure.
3
The food was okay but I think the food was quite expensive and there wasn't a wide range of food to choose from in my opinion but maybe it's just me . Atmosphere was awesome though :
3
Decided to have iftar here. There was not much selection but menu was interesting. Price wise normal cafe standard. Food was not that tasty though with the exception of the chicken drumlets. Atmosphere was great but temperature of cafe quite warm
5
The restaurant was amazing but the prices are a little steep. Customer service was perfect and overall atmosphere was great, would definitely visit again.
5
Very impressive for first time visit. Excellent service, nice food and cool atmosphere. Definitely will come again.
2
Food received was cold can see it was taken out from the fridge. Mushroom soup was 100% tasteless not even slight taste of mushroom. Service give was good. Atmosphere was lively and romantic.
5
Food was delicious and worth the value. Service was also exceptional, we didnt have to wait too long for our food even though there was quite a crowd. Keep it up!
4
My first time at FIX and i was impressed with the food and customer service given. the ambience was nice and place was clean..
we ordered the meat platter, fish n chips for main. Ordered churros and donuts with salted egg dip. Love the taste.
5
The price is really reasonable.
Quality of the full are marvellous.
Quantity of the food portion are really appropriate to the price.
Customer service quality are superb.
For sure, will be recommending this restaurant to my fellow friends and colleagues to try the food out.
4
Ambience is nice, good service however if travel by public transport abit inconvenient; require car to reach
4
Not the most accessible (takes a bit of walking), but not too far in, so it's still fine. But i guess that results in a lesser crowd, so that worked out perfect for me. I love how the tables are right next to the pool, gives a feel like you're by the beach or by a river (thought it's actually really chlorinated water). Even though it's open air, it's pretty breezy and overall very relaxing.Food was fair enough, steak was a pretty big portion, fries were a good cut/nicely done (it's not easy to get good fries). Salted egg donuts wasn't as fantastic as i thought i might be, the creaminess of the dip and the oiliness of the donuts became a bit too much after a while, didn't finish it. Maybe it would have been better to have it more savoury or with a bit more zing to the sauce. It was, at the moment, sweet but not too sweet, like a bit of a confused dish.They had an indoor area as well that was very pretty. Definitely a place i would consider if i needed to hold a large group casual dinner or party. If not, definitely will be returning for the awesome chillax atmosphere :
5
Love the ambience of the cafe. Got a seat by the poolside and it's perfect for catching up sessions with beloved friends. Will definitely Chope more seats at FIX in future.
4
Overall experience was very good. The food and atmosphere were above my expectations. I will recommend to my friends and family.
5
I love the service there! I give the food rating as acceptable. Ordered my steak medium rare, but part of the stead rare.
Otherwise, I enjoyed my time there!
5
Good unpretentious setting, relaxed sitting by the pool, reasonable price, great tasting food.
Great place to chill out with friends and relax sitting beside the pool.
5
Had my team lunch here. As per the title, awesome place and great food! Nice and pleasant service...
3
BBQ platters are pretty good (hint: the meats are better than the seafood). However, the restaurant suffers from too many hard surfaces so its noisy and not a cosy, quiet restaurant. Tap water is self-service, which is OK. Desserts were great!
5
Found this spot whilst looking for an alfresco BBQ place. Young staff are very helpful & the food great value (about $80 for 3). We loved the meat platter so much that we ordered more of some of the individual skewers. It's in a strange setting within a HomeTeamNS clubhouse but it works as the pool keeps the open area cool. Am guessing the small AC section is open on weekends. The freshly made sodas... We had lime & Ginger... are refreshing. Kudos to the Chef for a good meal.

Came across this cafÃ© through social media and just by the photos and captions that go along with it on instagram â€¦ I had to try their food for myself and I wasnâ€™t disappointed.For starters I tried their mushroom soup which oh so good â€“ it didnâ€™t taste like it came from a campbell packet â€¦ which I have experienced at many other cafÃ©s that claims their soups are homemade. For mains my family ordered their lasagne, Primavera Pasta and King Salmon. My dish was the Salmon, which came with delicious sides â€“ smashed potatoes and a pasta salad. Great halal food right here coupled with really nice dÃ©cor. Did I mention that the cafÃ© is next to a pool?For drinks, I had their Iced Lemongrass Gula Melaka. Refreshing and sweet I must say. I had their Donuts with Salted Egg Dip for dessert. My oh my, it was sedap-licious.If there is one room for improvement, it would be their choice of music being played. I found the music rather unsuitable as there were many families with young children when I visited the cafÃ© and I did notice the uneasy look on the faces of the parents. I hope the staff takes note the next time.Overall, FIX certainly knows how to have their customers wanting to come back for more. As for me, Iâ€™ll certainly be back to try other items on their menu
5
This cool place is on the first floor of HomeTeamNS Balestier. Really chill place with the option of dining poolside. With lots of cafes popping up in Singapore right now, you get cafes that are either hits or misses â€“ and this is definitely a hit! They serve up really good coffee (pictured) and good food. Try the side of pasta with wild rice - al dente, rice has a good bite and it came in a simple yet flavorful sauce. My first visit was over a nice brunch for two. I was really happy with the food and service that I brought the team at work for lunch soon after! And I think Iâ€™ll keep coming back to this place over and over again.Tip: Take advantage of the baristas who genuinely know their stuff and get a cuppa
5
Had a wonderful time there!! Celebrated my sister's birthday there. Service was amazing!! Really impressed with the hospitality there. The food was delicious!! The fish was crispy and the chili con carne cheese fries was delicious. A lot of things have been reused to be turned into creative things. Pipes are being used to make the signs. Barrels are being used to put iced water. If you are a vintage lover, you should really try to dine there. Bye!!
5
We had a good time, food was good and came out fast. Ambience was good too. Quite a few backdrops for photo taking.
3
Service was slow, enhance the service would be great.
Limited food and beverage choice
Overall rating is average
5
The cafe was spacious and cooling with a pleasant poolside view. Service was excellent even though no service charge was imposed.
5
Make a reservation for my team bonding via dinner. Overall good food and value for money. My guys enjoyed the session!
3
First time go to Fix, environment is nice with indoor and outdoor. However, the comment on the food online is not to my expectation. Too highly rated.
5
Value for money. Intimate location for a good gathering. Could have more selections for main courses. Best chilli cheese fries.
5
Everytime I visit fix I'm always surprised by how pleasant my experience is. The food is good and the wait staff are friendly. Not to be missed are the arancini duck balls, the orange and chrysanthemum tea and their rose gold milkshake. Yummy. Their chocolate on the churros is a miss though... but everything else is good.
4
Nice place and corner seat were given. Variety of food was average.We ordered mushroom soup (4 star), prawn & mango salad (3 star), seafood platter (3 star), salted egg donut (4 star). *5 star being the highest rating. Saw the order placed by the next table, the fish & chips & steak seems like a better deal.
1
I was there for a birthday dinner with my family and had grill meat platter which was terrible. They even managed to botch up churros because it had a bitter aftertaste. I put up a complaint to the management for the terrible food but received no reply so far. It was bad all around. In total I paid a hundred bucks and it was a rip-off for the rubbish food they served. Please avoid at all costs. The poolside dining experience cannot make up for the lousy food. Completely disappointed. They should change their chef
4
My first time trying out this cafe. Love, love, love the indoor environment more . The food were great! The drinks that my friends and I had was the Lemongrass Tea. The sweetness of gula melaka was a bit too much for us thou. If possible, just add a bit of it or a tablespoon of sugar syrup as to taste more of the Lemongrass. The churros were eggcelent! The amount of sugar on each churros was so full till we licked our fingers too. Also, i would like to make a quick good feedback on one of the staff who looks liked a japanese guy. Love the way he served us. Also, he is cute too! Hahax. Overall double thumbs up! Would bring my other half next time soon again.
5
The place not crowded. Cozy environment. Nice food. Worth the price. Friendly service with a smile..
3
i preferred the previous options of Fix cafe and Fix grill before the merger.
the food are yummy but portions very small, the main dish is like a starter.
the waiters gave too much attention i felt .. i would have preferred more privacy.
3
Fish & chips was really good. I had the churros which was perfect with the milky choc dipping sauce. I highly recommend the churros!
4
A very good restaurant to chill the night away. Food was pretty good and the staff was friendly to introduce the place around
2
It's a very pretty place and I was impressed by how clean it was. We ordered a chicken tikka naanwich, assorted grilled meat and a mac n cheese. All the dishes did not taste especially good, the naan for the naanwich for example was clearly store bought, and tasted like it had been frozen and then heated up. The chicken tikka was bland and the chicken had cartilage. The grilled meats didn't taste very hot, and I've definitely had much better Mac n cheese. For dessert I ordered the choux which was on display and then waited for it for ages. Turns out the waiters and waitresses cannot pronounce "choux" and thought I'd said churros, so they brought churros and I had to physically get up and go show them the choux I wanted in the cake display. When I showed it the waitress said "oh you meant the butterscotch!" as if to imply that I had ordered wrongly. Butterscotch is a flavour not a pastry, so perhaps they should really educate the waitstaff on the difference. In the end the choux tasted old and frozen which made us wonder how long it had been on display. Won't be going back all that way as it seems to be another gimmicky restaurant with food which they claim they'd feed their own families...but store bought/frozen naan? Really?
1
My experience dining at FIX was a terrible one. It was forgettable and I'll definitely not come back.Since FIX was always mentioned in articles and Instagram, I thought I would bring my sister and a friend from Scotland to have a late lunch there.When I said I have a reservation made, the waitress seems confused. We decided to sit inside but realised it was too loud due to a birthday celebration and asked for a change of seat. Another waitress brought us outside and since there's an empty seat nearby the pool, I asked can I sit there, she said no. We have to attract the attention of any staff to take our orders instead of them being attentive to us. And let me be clear that it was not busy at all. Most of them are just chatting and laughing behind the counter. By then, there are already 2 empty seats near the pool. I asked the waiter again, can we change our seat. He said I'll check. And after taking our orders, the waiter gone's missing.Food came late, food came before the drinks and we have to cancel our dessert order because it took too long. I will still find it worth it if the food is any good, disappointingly, not at all. Lasagna was lack of cheese, the breakfast plate sausage tasted salty and sour-ish, the naan was cold and the egg on the naan looks like vomit.To sum it all, the service sucks, the waiters are lazy and the food is meh. FIX are clearly all about the talks but no action.
3
Overall experience was fair. Could have been much better. Food was good value. Dishes were flavourful and met expectations. However, wait service could see improvements. Wait staff needs to be more attentive and provide basic items like menu and water when customers arrive. And clear dishes from the table promptly. 
3
They are lack of manpower. And sometimes they tend to forget your request. They have no communication within themself that orders have to be repeated via other staff. Was requesting for a birthday cake privately with the staff. Ended up they ask me infront of my friend (birthday person). It's like not a surprise anymore. But I can see they're trying their best to serve us all. Overall their food and atmosphere is good. And the staff is friendly. They just need to improve a little bit on their service. Won't regret coming tho
3
Service was good but the Mix grill and Fix grill that we ordered came to the table cold. Not acceptable. The penne pasta and octopus with wild rice were good. Had booked table by phone and online but very dissapointed, as when we arrived, the indoor seating that we booked not available. Defeat the purpose of making a reservation
3
Would rate this place 3.5..definitely above "Average" but not "Very good" yet.Thankful for the fantastic service of Emmeline who corresponded and helped reserved a slice of their Matcha Opera Cake even though she was off-duty. Otherwise, I would have lost the chance to eat the pretty cake. The meat platter was flavourful, yummy and filling though it was served warm that turned cold rather quickly
4
The mains were great! Felt that the sides were rather pedestrian. The liusha donuts were though! Overall still a great experience!
4
Cozy enough to cater for a big group of friends for casual gatherings. Service was awesome and prices are reasonable.
5
The food were nice and served quite fast after order was made. Good place for a group of friends, staffs were friendly too.
5
It was nice time there and the stuffs were really friendly and nice. Good place for couples to date!!!
4
Good atmosphere. Whats more important is that the service was superb. The staff was professional. The price is reasonable.
5
Place was empty, food was good and the ambience was great. Food came pretty fast upon ordering. Would definitely come again!
4
Came by @ 7pm. No one was there (customers).. then we were greeted by the stuff. Super friendly and awesome service by the staff. Portions were big, delicious and affordable.
4
Really enjoyed my dinner here, and while I only had a side of grilled sweet potato and a main pasta dish, I was so full that I could hardly finish the doughnuts with salted egg yolk dip that I shared with my friend! Portions were good for the price I paid. Will definitely be back again
1
1 - service was bad. We were served our sharing dish with no side plates & utensils 2- the middle of the fried chicken was RAW + my friend and I shared the dish and had diahorrea. She vomited. Unfortunately we didn't take photo of the raw meat before asking for a new dish. RAW MEAT seriously?!
3
Joshua was good introducing the food and drinks. Mixed feelings about the food. Primavera pasta was served in a almost soup like manner. Appetizer seemed over cooked and only tastes cheese rather than duck. Slow roasted chicken was ok. Our favorite was the fish. Chicken wings were not too bad. So I guess only the bbq items are done well. The rest can give it a miss. Dun think I'll be rushing back here anytime soon.   
4
The food was lovely and the crew was very professional and welcoming. The food was a little pricey as compared to their Fix Cafe. Nevertheless, it is a good place to go to for a group gathering.
4
I love the food. Good sizing portion.
1)slowcooked chicken;juicy,flavourful
2)lob roll;pricey but tasty
3)grilled chix;Superb
4)drinks;value for $$
4
The ambience was lovely and so was the food. Price reasonable, friendly staff.
Would definitely come again for special occasions.
4
The staffs were very friendly and accomodating. We had steak, salmon and lasagna -it was all cooked perfectly! I will definitely come for a 2nd trip next time round. Kudos Fix Grill!
5
The place is a little tight, I wish I had more space and privacy to eat but the quality of the food really makes up for it. Service was prompt and servers were friendly. Primavera Pasta was excellent and so was the Watermelon salad with prawns. The Slow Cooked Chicken was excellent as well. In fact, I didn't except to like all the food that we ordered. So I really hope that Fix Grill will keep up with this standard of service and quality.
4
Fix Grill has a variety of freshly prepared food from starters to desserts. I highly recommend the Hokkaido Scallop Quinoa and definitely their grills. U HAVE TO TRY THE GRILLS! My friend and I couldn't get enough of the grill dishes. The grills were prepared simple, retaining its goodness, lightly flavoured with spices and herbs & cooked to perfection, especially their Chicken Wings and Squid grills. (Sorry, I do not have the exact name of those two dishes). Service was two thumbs up! The only thing I didnt enjoy was the platter of skewers. I felt it was too much to handle. I only enjoyed the mushrooms on the skewers. Overall experience, fantastic. I didn't get to try the desserts this time round, but I will definitely do on the next! Fab job FIX
4
As the name would have it, this joint prides itself on serving grilled highlights. I ordered the Ribeye Steak ($22) and it was done to perfection. I found the cream sauce, tomatoes and sweet potatoes very cohesive in completing the overall taste and colour of the dish.The wife's slow roasted chicken was tender and very flavorful. You'd be surprised how difficult it is to get chicken of such standards nowadays.Overall, FIX Grill has gotten their basics right and really live up to being one of the best grill restaurants in Singapore.
5
when i first dined at FIX Grill & Cafe with my family, I made a mental note to return again because the food was just so delicious!!!& guess what, I returned with my friends the next week! We tried each others'dishes and every dish I was like "OMG THIS IS SO GOOD".my first time there, I ordered the seafood aglio olio.. honestly, i dunno why i did because i am not a huge fan of aglio olio. they are always so dry and tasteless. but not at Fix! it wasn't too dry and the pasta was just so damn good. i dunno how else to describe it.second time there, i ordered the cream pasta (i forget its name) and again, i wasnt a fan of cream pasta because they're always too milky and cheesy, not to my liking... but i did anyway.. after my first visit, i had faith that every other dish will taste as good. i was right!FIX GRILL IS A MUST TO GO.I will definitely return again, DUH!! oh, please tell the chefs that they're doing such a great job!!
4
Came with a large group for halal dinner with colleagues. Starters are a little small, fix platter was value for money. The different soda drinks were refreshing and tasted great! Watermelon & prawn salad was not bad, huge chunks of watermelon in it. Vegetarian pasta primavera was tasty with pesto sauce, scallops were nicely done as well. Didn't really like the squid and grilled snapper though. Could have done with more seasoning. Salmon with wild rice was very good! Service needs a little improvement but they always had a smile on their faces and were welcomin
4
I had fix grill for my dad's birthday. Great ambiance indoor and outdoor. The waiter who served us was very polite and friendly. Didn't manage to catch his name tho.The grilled platter with the pumpkin paste sauce was amazing.I was just disappointed with the lobster roll. Expected something more. Other than that, it was all good. Worth my trip and money!
