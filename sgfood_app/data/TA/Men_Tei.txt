Ordered delivery of the noodles n gyoza via uber eats. The noodles is nice and the soup base is good. The gyoza is delicious too. The price is also reasonable.

I've been a regular since opening. In my opinion, the best ramen in Singapore. For once, not too oily nor salty. I especially like the shoyu ramen, with a very distinctive and subtle flavour. Gyoza are also very good. The place is rather noisy, so I wouldn't go there on a date

If you work around the area, or is just looking for a good place to it, give it a go. They have a few variations on the traditional japanese ramen, like some spicy options, different sauce, etc.For side dishes, the gyoza are quite tasty. But for now my favorite is the chicken chashu cubes. So exquisite

I'm surprised that there is no prior review. Men Tei serves affordable and very good ramen at the CBD area. Its tamago used to be perfectly runny, though recent visits have been rather disappointing in the tamago front. However, the soup base is superb, and serves the best shio base i have tried in Singapore. The Tonkotsu base is also stellar (but not as good as Tonkotsu King) though. It tends to be very crowded at lunchtime- expect to wait, but i recommend eating at dinnertime to avoid the crowd
