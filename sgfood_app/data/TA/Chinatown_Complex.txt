Was in Chinatown so I thought that I'd go through this building. It was an interesting experience. A semi-typical fish market. There were many kinds of fish and shellfish, frogs and turtles available for food. Some if it was even on ice. Very wet floor so be careful with wearing sandals. It would be a good place to buy fresh fish certainly
5
Forget the street level places, this is the very best place to sample the best hawker food in Singapore. Take the escalator to the second level, and you will be astonished by the variety of food, and the quality. This is where the locals eat, and it is busy all day. We ate late, around 7 pm, but most of the stalls are still open, and you can get a nice cold beer to go with your meal. The cleanliness is excellent, as all vendors are regularly inspected and certified. This is THE place to eat the best hawker food in Singapore. Try it while you still can - may of the people cooking the best food in the traditional way are in the older age bracket, and will be looking to retire in the next 5 to 10 years - so sample the true food of Singapore while they are still producing amazing traditional food from tiny kitchens

Went here for a Friday lunch. It was especially crowded due to the Michelin star chicken rice. Went around and found this porridge store selling porridge at SGD$2.50 (USD$1.80) which makes it the cheapest porridge store in Singapore. The stall name is Tian Tian Porridge and it's hidden in a corner so happy hunting
5
Went as part of a tour so I tried several different types of food. Also got to visit the wet market which was quite interesting. Put a tissue box on the table to save your place and try the lime juice. A must visit when in Singapore
4
Unlike a few of the other hawker centres in Singapore, this complex is clean. The options here are the usual...chicken rice, duck, wonderful soups, and so forth. Just a great place to come and sample Singapore's varied cuisine for very little money. We arrived at about 11 before the real crowds. You'll be waiting in line much later than this
3
We (total 9pax) came here to have lunch at the hawker food Centre with one of the stall "Hongkong Zi Char". We ate the pork knuckles, sweet sour pork, pork ribs, fried chicken, fried veg, veg soup etc. Cost S$168.Thereafter, we bought some clothes n shoes for my mum,Y2018 calendar, & dried medical stuff across the street. Easily can spend up to 2.5hrs here.
5
The food area is on level 2 of this complex. There are many stalls to chose from and plenty of seating around. Have a wander to see what is around. I had a seafood fried rice, which was very good indeed. Take some wipes with you as the stalls don’t give out paper hand towels
5
We started off looking at the wet market in the basement. Very exotic foods that are not in offer at home!! The next floor up was cheap souvenir stalls. On level 2 was the huge Hawker Centre. So many stalls to choose from with such different dishes. Eve our vegetarian daughter ate well here. I had braised pork, my husband tried a kway char tay and my son had slow cooked “pigs leg” - all delicious. The only hint I would give people is to take tissues or hand wipes as there were no serviettes in offer
5
Wan Wan Shanghai style deep fried dumplings situated at 02-93 in Chinatown Complex. They offer deep fried dumplings done until it turn Golden Color. Beside deep fried, they also offer steamed dumplings or soup dumplings. One of the best ingredients made by the shanghai lady who had modified it to the taste buds of Singaporean. Many people from Chinatown complex confirmed her dumplings is one of the best and I had send the dumplings to various friends for tasting
5
Various valuable food to choose. Really local flavor for both locals and travelers. Satay is cheaper than Changji village. Fruit juice costs $1.2 only which would be the lowest juice price in SG. Fish head is $13 which portion will probably feed 2 adults with rice. This hawker offers various beer also. Take some grilled chicken wings or satay or calamari with some beer and sit at night to enjoy the old time. It's a huge hawker. Travelers MÄY get lost. This hawker center is more valuable than those tourists stalls in smith street
4
I have come to many Chinatowns in the world; this Chinatown Complex which I feel peaceful, not as shabby as in other countries and cities, but still retains its inherent characteristics.
5
I was completely delighted to visit this area. Worth the time to walk around and enjoy all the foods and shops.
5
I love this place - lots to look around and lots of delicacies to try at reasonable prices. This place always feels full of energy which I love.
5
It is a building at the heart of china town in front of buddha tooth temple.the best places to eat in chinatown is this and the food road that called smith street.try to taste many different tastes.
4
A place to visit when you are in Chinatown. Cheap eats. Try the local breakfast there in 1950 - toast with Kaya and butter, a cup of coffee and half boiled eggs to start off a new day!! Other than that, there are plenty of local delicacies you can choose there
4

Despite of the location (not clean), everything is great !!Love the authentic taste and atmosphere of this food court.i order fish ball soup with rice, from Super Mummy stall. Great brooth, fresh fish ball, love it.Also buy bakcang from another stall (forgot the name), and also delicious.You can see my travel picture at my Instagram : @adjimantor
5
When you go to Singapore you have to go and eat here. I never miss this place when we go to Singapore.As food courts go, this has to be the biggest, there are hundreds of food stalls. A word of advice, when you find a place to sit, and your partner goes to order the food. Take notice of the colour of the table as the tables are colour coded for different areas. Also take notice of where you walk as you will have trouble finding your way back to the table if you don't. If you get lost just look for the table colours and you will be in the general area.I just love the Sata
5
We stayed not far from Chinatown Complex and even though we only had 2 1/2 days in Singapore we had 3 meals here. BBQ pork and rice on our first night, noodle soup for lunch the next day then dumplings that night. Look for the queues for the dumpling place 2-135. Very efficiently run place and friendly people. Some stalls sold beer or boy from 7Eleven stores in nearby streets
4
Arriving in a hotel near Chinatown for a 24 hour stopover we took the advice of TA and went to the 2nd floor food court of the China town complex. Following the particular stall advice we went to stall 116 and had the duck pork and rice combo and the wanton special all for $10 AUD. We then found this place for the best steamed pork buns and dumplings $5 AUD. Delicious!
5
On the 2nd floor there is a food court. You can eat there really cheap but very taisty chineese food (less than 4-5 dollars)! It is great experience
5
This place was a little hard to find, but I think this is where we ate.
Great food, very cheap and busy
5
We came here for the food and didn't shop. The popiah and soya chicken made it a must stop for us. Highly recommend it!
4
If you want look for authentic experience than the Singapore local food then you should give this place a try,
5
Mutton soup cook in Chinese medicine and the local Hawker food. Secret Ancestral formula passed down from China to Singapore established in 1943. One of Singapore best food awards for local Hawker food. Located Chinatown Complex unit 02/093. The soup very strong aroma and the meat very tender. Good for the body as healthy tonics
3
This shopping center has souvenirs & restaurants for dinner. And those sell Chinese things, includes foods and souvenirs. It's very big travel destination. At this destination, there is Chinatown MRT Station (NE4, DT19) for travels in Singapore. It's recommended for travelers who will travel to Singapore
5
If you want to try different types of good & authentic local food at local cheap prices- right in the heart of the city, this is the BEST place to go to ie the 2nd floor food (hawker) centre at Chinatown Complex.This is probably the biggest hawker centre here. Take note that once a week, individual stall will close for their restday ( Mondays has the most closures).Highly recommended to try these "long" time food stalls (see separate individual reviews)1. Super Mummy Hainanese chicken rice ( steamed white chicken)2. Kazan Japanese Cuisine3. Ann Chin Popiah4. Babas Peranakan5. Golden Dragon Hainanese curry rice6. 116 Roasted Pork & Duck/ Braised Chicken noodles & rice7. The 1950s Coffee stall ( coffee/tea & Kaya toast)8 . Ming Fa NoodlesNote: Nos 6,7 & 8 stalls are located side by side9. Hong Kong Soya sauce chicken(Original branch - Michelin star award stall)10. Bangkok Thai Food11. Hong Kong Mongkok Tim Sum12. Food Street Fried noodles (Kway Teow)13. Taiwanese Cuisine14. Lao Wang Chicken Rice ( steamed white chicken) - this is a new stall, opened recently. Chicken is soft/tender. Chilli sauce thick & hot. Comes with garlic sauce too. Soup has nice herbal taste.There are many other stalls which you can try but these are our regular favourites.Just order your food ( self-service), find any empty tables & have your food there. Free seatings anywhere.If you have time, visit the Wet Market at Basement level. Experience a local wet market selling fresh meat, seafood & vegetables. And try the many types of tropical & non tropical fruits. At low prices too
5
Of the 5 hawker centres that I was able to go to, this one is my favorite. The food here is cheap, the portions are a good size to sample everything, but most importantly, the food is just amazing. Make sure to stop by Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao for XLB and On Tap to wash down all the heavenly delicacies
5
If you head straight to level 2 of the Chinatown Complex you will find the best and cheapest food. We had steamed pork & leak dumplings which were to die for. Followed by chicken and rice and Japanese katsu udon. Washed down with freshly squeezed mango and pineapple juices.The food here is amazing and everything costs between $3-10. Definitely worth a visit
4
I want to visit this place, as the michellin stars cheapest food is inside this place.Liao Fan hongkong soya chicken which also has new shop outside this complex.The new place is also crowded although it's already passed lunch time. You will passes this new place if you walk from the bus stop. We can walk few meters only less than 5 minutes from the bus stop nearby, it called new bridge ctr.But that time i go straight to the complex to get more food option to try.After getting a table and let my husband sit there, i start to hunt for food.First i go to the michellin stall and after saw the stall i thought wow nobody queuing and i was happy for a second. After that the owner told me to queue across the stall.. the queue was around 15 people and sadly when my queue only left 2 persons the owner said NO MORE !!!I had to find other food where i finally bought hainan chicken rice which was okay and fried kuayteow in stall with few queue as i always have a thing for kuayteow.The kuayteow was rich in flavor so I'm quite happy with it.I also went to the toilet but found it was dirty so I decided to hold my urges
3
We went to the wet market after Take Po for dim sum.
We always buy the ytf stall which is very cheap. Also veg n fresh fishes here are cheap too. Fresh flowers are reasonably fresh n lasting.
Not crowded on a Good Friday morning
4
I would like to recommend this hawker centre to all tourists.
They have almost all the local food from Singapore.
Cheap and very good.
They have very good Claypot rice, chicken rice and many others.
Place can be a little dirty during peak hours.
4
We just love this complex and are spoilt for choice! We had amazing BBQ Pork and Duck all the a very cheap price.
4
Good place to find some tasty food at night. Chinese cuisines and all. Plenty of food to choose for.
5
Market, food market, hawker center... Shop and eat here, at your own peril!!!! So much to choose. Their pot sticker dumplings are awesome, so is the yutiao, 50s coffee shop, and the hong kong chicken stall too. This isn't a place you want to miss out on. There is so much to do, so much to buy and so much to eat!!
4
Although it took us a few walks around the complex to decide what to eat we had an enjoyable lunch with lots of variety. We sampled fresh stir-fried noodles, duck, chicken, and of course some cookies and filled mini-cakes for dessert. Delicious and so reasonable! Downstairs the wet market was fascinating - can't wait to try the crab spice and curry powder we bought from the famous anthony the spice maker
1
They are many good food in Chinatown.I strongly recommend tourist to visit this place if you want to have a taste of traditional local food.I would like to share one of my unpleasant experience sometime back in January 2017, when I was there to order roast duck takeaway for my family gathering dinner from one of the store.This unscrupulous hawker store I've had visited in Chinatown 116 烧腊。麵 ( pinyin - 116 shaola。mian) was not honest and friendly.Don't get cheated by the fresher roast duck that displayed in the outer shelf, what you see is not what you get. They took from the leftover roast duck (can be overnight) to pack into your takeaway boxes without you knowing. You will not get a chance to see them swopping to old stock because your visibility will be blocked by the meats displayed in the outer shelf.If you think having to pay for leftover night food was worst enough, this is not the end yet. When I reached home, I realised that my whole roasted duck was shortchanged by one drumstick.I was so furious and speechless, and returning back to the unscrupulous store will take another 25km of travel distance and it just doesn't make any sense to do that.After all the bad experiences I had with that particular store, I still love ❤️ to visit this place because of the authenticity of tradition food which you can never find it elsewhere in Singapore  Just be mindful and last but not least, enjoy the good food and have fun..... cheers!!
5
The popiah skin is made at the shop and it is very nice and fresh. The fillings are also delicious where they are crispy and nice. There is always a queue at the shop and I will recommend this shop. The shop is located to the right just after the staircase
4
we had meals in this complex and once we got the hang of ordering the food ,placing it in a bowl ,it was weighed and priced. we were given a buzzer and it flashed when food was cooked.,tasty clean hot food and the price was far cheaper than eating in the posh malls restaurants!! we are going back on holiday again in the area. a local told us that they are inspected by environment offices and safe to eat.!
5
If you want a taste of local food and know what the local eats for their three meals this is one of the place in Singapore you have to visit. There are food stalls on the second floor. In the basement there is a wet market which will be very interesting if you visit in the morning to see what sort of food is being sold. On the ground floor there is a array of shoes selling clothes, shoes, souvenirs and knick-knack
4
a great place for china food in singapore,must go!there's a lot of delicious food for everyone.pay after order and wait for pick up by yourself.hawker food with fair price
4
We couldn't find the famous Hong Kong Soya Chicken, so we settled for the duck stall in the corner...and it was delicious! For $8, it came with rice/noodles, BBQ pork, crispy duck, and crispy skinned pork. The sauces are to die for.
4
This was one of the favourite place for breakfast few years old. Love the glutinous rice by few old uncles and 云吞面 by an old couple with their grandson. Unfortunately both stalls are closed now. Tried other stalls like dim sum, you tiao and even coffee ... so so only.
5
Downstairs, this heart of Chinatown building houses a huge number of local shops selling souvenir as well as holiday goods. Go up a flight and you have hundreds of colorful Hawker stans cooking amazing authentic foods. You name it, you can find it, food-wise. All stalls have clearly labeled health ratings (e.g., A, B, etc. ). Stick to the A's and B's. Go from one to another, or choose from complete meals. Communal tables. Here is where real people of this community chow down. Hint: watch for any stall selling something you might like (food prep is right in front of your eyes) that has people quad up in front of it-- that will be a food vendor that is highly regarded for its food offerings. The building is covered, but open air (No AC)) and very crowded, but wonderful fun, even if you fail to partake of the various exotic foods ( which would be a mistake

This is one place I always like to bring my relatives here. Specialty hawker food at reasonable price. This time we visited on Christmas night. Chinatown seem relatively quiet on Christmas night. The decoration for the Chinese New Year are already put up in place but the lights are not switched on like Orchard Road. The lanes look coldly quiet. But up at the food court it was crowded and noisy. Surprisingly, I saw a few Caucasian tourists having their dinner here as well. It is a sign that foreign tourists have come to know and think highly of our hawker foods. I would confidently say that if you are in Singapore and have not tasted our hawker foods, you are deemed not to have visited Singapore. We ordered two big clay-pot rice spiced up with salted fish and crunchy pork slices. We also ordered curry mee; sugar cane drinks and song fish delicacies. There were news articles and awards displayed prominently at both stalls which were in recognition of their great culinary skills. I found that the stall helpers were very courteous and helpful seem like they have undergone some customer service training.The parking at the public car park is also relatively cheap. It only costs me a dollar that night.I am proud of our hawkers. This place is an oasis of nice great delicious food and I have never stopped coming here
4
Food is sold from kiosks - no problem, you order, pay, wait and pickup to take to your table. Food cooked quickly, tastes fine, and the staff ae4 friendly and speak English. If you want to take a drink with your meal though, you have to go to the kiosk down the end to get a beer etc and pay separately. Not sure why that is - and on your way back it's easy to forget where you ordered. Shaded, but very hot. We liked it
4
Many of the stalls in the Chinatown Complex food center used to be plying their trade outside on the streets surrounding it, such as Smith St and Trengganu St. There is also a growing number of stalls run by younger people geared to the taste of the younger people and visitors, such as beer from the taps. The food centre is at its busiest in the morning when many locals would come for breakfast, especially during weekends. And afternoon when the office workers nearby would come for lunch. In between, many people who still come to the Chinatown Wet Market (at the basement) would stop over for their favorite breakfast, lunch or just dessert. For an easy start, try the Cantonese Chicken Rice (very much like the Hainanese Chicken Rice, except for the Chilli) and the Cantonese Claypot Rice (you have to wait for an hour to get your pot of freshly cooked rice with chicken and sausages in it). A very local epicurean feast awaits. See how much you can take in one seating. :

Food is generally good BUT the pigeon management is really disappointing. Even though attempts to scare away pigeons through dummy paper crows were introduced, the pigeons are way smarter then what the management thinks they are. To be more concise, they're useless in addressing the issue. Pigeons are seen aggressively flying across tables and leftover cutlery, poking through the legs of customers and even giving tables and customers their heavenly droppings from the overhanging pipes. Perhaps if the management is able to adopt more effective "anti- pigeon" measures by enclosing all open areas with safety nets (like the those implemented at Bishan Bus Interchange Hawker Centre), dining at Chinatown Food Complex will be a much more hygienic and pleasant experience
4
The hawker stalls by the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a GREAT place for a break. There is something for everyone. You just have to walk around the center until you find it. The food is good and VERY reasonable. You can eat for under SG$10. It is also accessible via the Chinatown MRT station. After you get something to eat, walk around till you find a vendor selling ice cream. A great desert on a hot day. Be adventuresome and you will have some really GREAT food at a BARGAIN price
4
There are plenty of interesting stalls in this giant market, but you need some local knowledge of which ones to visit. This visit I just went to the local coffee place The Fifties and the 115 Tang Shui outlet for dessert - had lunch at a nearby restaurant outside the complex. Next visit I need to prepare a bit better for with some research on specifically where to go
4
Join the longest queue and enjoy some local food at unbelievably cheap prices. Cooked to your order, you can't go wrong. Pick up a fresh juice to wash down your meal - delicious.
5
One of my favorite places in Singapore to get something to eat. The stalls on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex are easily found and it is simple to find something nice to eat. Also, the prices are wonderfully cheap. Recommended if you're looking for cheap eats
4
There are many varities of fishes n seafood n vegetables sold here. I dont buy the fresh chicken from here as I saw many cats around this section. Omg!The hawker centre upstairs is one place I always go for dinner or lunch sometimes. Many Nice Food! Come & see for yourself
4
I love this place on rainy afternoons, especially on the weekends. The food choices are endless and nothing is more than few dollars. My favourites are the popiah and fried fish soup stalls and you can get great desserts - ice kachang etc.Apart from the huge variety of food I love the atmosphere down the end that overlooks the Buddhist temple. This corner doubles as a pub for the older Chinese gentlemen and after a few beers they start singing and laughing. It's a fabulous spot for people watching.It's an open air hawker centre - certainly no spotless, white table clothed restaurant, and various bird species help themselves to left overs but it's a fabulous slice of old-style Singapore life. Probably my favourite hawker centre complex in all of Singapore
4
Try the claypot rice, fish beehoon soup,fish head and grilled stingray at the back of the hawker centre. The stalls are near the back staircase connected to the residential block behind and away from the main escalator. The dish beehoon soup is gloriously rich in sweetness(try the stall Anji) and they come in various sizes $4,$5,$8 and $12
5
You may think that Chinatown complex might make you over spend on your budget because this is tourist spot. You are wrong. This is one of the old place which you can find cheap and nice food. It consist of 3 level. Basement level is the wet market. Ground level will sundry or clothing follow Hythe 2nd level which is the hawker centre is. Follow the Q if it is long. Otherwise,you can walk around the food centre to search for the great food. 1 star Stall is there too but please be prepare to Q at least hours. If you are there in the morning. After your meal,you may want to proceed to the basement level of the market. Is consist of the wet and dry market where the local will do their Marketing
4
Waiting for around 2-hour in a long queue makes you more patient and tolerant.To kill the time it is advisable you come along with friends or relative, but at least you will know better of Singaporean Food Court, and Singaporean behavior toward culinary in particular, new meal and dishes, as informed by Michelin. This Hongkong Chicken rice is different with ordinary chicken rice, you can find easily in most of Singaporean food court.Feel happy at the end, as you get the chicken rice or noodle, and you will be suprised with the price, very cheap.
5
There's a huge market downstairs, where you can buy everything, including alive frogs, and all goods are really fresh. And the complex upstairs that's a real foodie's paradise. If you, like me, don't know what to chose first, join the longest line and ask locals to help you with order. BTW, famous Hainanese Chicken Rise was excellent there
4
I always thought Singapore is one of the most expensive country, food price is also too expensive for me, BUT, NOT HERE. I was amazed by the huge selection of food and guess what? The food price is cheap as well. Most of the stalls are Chinese foods, but they have other choices as well. Some stalls really have a long queue. I wish they could open until night because most of them were closed at 8pm when I wanted to return back for dinne
5
We happened across this building upon following advice from other tourists on the Fun Vee Bus. We entered the Chinese Complex in Chinatown and looked at the many stalls on the ground floor selling clothes and shoes. We took the escalator to the first floor where we were overwhelmed with the variety of tiny food stalls selling authentic hot food. We ate the Popiah (excellent cold spring rolls) and hot spring rolls. I had a teenager who was very fussy about trying the food but she was easily won over! We had the "donut" and "butterfly" desert - both deep fried and yum. We drank iced tea which was also excellent. The food was fantastic and we would return however we visited Gluttons Bay hawker food centre at the marina area and plan to go to Newton Food hawker place so if time permits we will. The small lanes leading off the Chinatown Complex held stalls selling fans, clothes, chopsticks, fresh fruit, food, clothes etc and were great to walk around. There were lanterns strung up and stalls selling mooncackes for the lantern festival
4
Maybe too many different choices of cuisine (Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian), but you can find your own. Also many street food. Can seat outside
4
Enjoyed our night at the food market prices were reasonable compared to anywhere else great food cooked on the spot a great vibe & would definately go back
4
玛莉亞 soya chicken rice. $14 for a whole delicious succulent chicken. the tofu ball is soft n silky. it's worth the Q 😊
4
Had a huge 2-course dinner for under S$9 last night. Most places don't appear to actually have a menu so it's worth watching what other people have and ask for the same. Also, cash appears to be the only option. I managed to get a good assortment of spring rolls and other pastries followed by some stir fried phat noodles with seafood - delicious. Large beer for S$5.50 was pretty good and far cheaper than at the hotel (S$12 for a small beet)
3
If you've been to a Chinatown anywhere in the world, don't bother here. It's no better or worse. The usual markets, not cheap. The usual food stalls. Nothing outstanding here.However don't miss going to The Sacred Buddha Temple Tooth Relic Temple and Museum. That is really fantastic
5
Come with an empty stomach and you will leave satisfied. It is a huge food court on the second level of the building. The lower level has stores selling clothes and other stuff. There are many variety to choose from. You settle down at a table and then go around and shop for the food you like. Tell them your table number and they will bring you your food when it is ready. Believe it or not, there some Michelin star restaurants here
4
If a tourist in Singapore then you must visit the hawker markets in the Chinatown complex. Sure, there are plenty of Chinese food cafes etc in the surrounding streets but the hawker markets just have that bit more in raw authenticity. Surprisingly, there weren't all that many tourists when we went for lunch, but you know the food is good when the locals eat it. We had intended to eat from the stall that's been awarded a Michelin star, but the line was so long and did not move - I stood in it for 30 mins and then we watched it for another 30 mins while we ate at another stall. He's obviously selling good food. The food we had from one of the other vendors was cheap - fried chicken and noodles, with soup for $3,50, delicious. After lunch, visit some of the shops on the different levels
5
The highlight of this Complex is the huge local food centre on 2nd floor. Here, you find hundreds of stalls selling many good, authentic local food at cheap & good value prices. Including Thai, Japanese, HongKong, Taiwanese, Malay food too.At this moment, you will instantly see one daily long queue once you are up the escalator - for HongKong Soya Sauce Chicken. Queues has tripled since they were awarded the One Michelin star award last week. Be prepared to queue more than 2 hours. Note there are MANY other very good food here worth trying- without need to wait for 2 hours. Here are some ( see individual reviews & some photos insite).1. Super Mummy Hainanese Chicken Rice 2. Dragon Village Hainanese Curry Rice 3. Babas Peranakan ( mixed dishes/rice) 4. Kazan Japanese Cuisine 5. 116 Roast duck/chicken/pork noodles/soup/rice6. Taiwanese Cuisine 7. New Market Seafood Soup & Porridge8. Ming Fa noodles9. HongKong Mongkok Tim SumTake note many stalls are closed on Monday (weekly restday). Not a good time to come. However some stalls(few) are closed on other weekdays instead.Every 3 months ie Mar/Jun/Sept/Dec, the whole Chinatown Complex will be closed for 2-3 days for major washing/cleaning. Banner will be displayed at escalator area informing of next washing dates
3
I go there with family for dinner from our hotel at orchard. The information from the internet mentioned they close at 10pm; but actually many stall closed when we were visiting at 7pm.Only several stall, and there were not much choice. The taste and the price is not really good. It merely same with other food court in the other market. Not worthied to visit if you are not staying in chinatown area
4
If you want a bit more authentic experience than the 'Food Street' give this place a try. I went based on a taxi driver recommendation and was not disappointed. Plenty to choose from and my fried oysters and Hokkien noodles hit the spot. Apparently the clay pot rice is one of the best, but we were too hungry to wait in the long queue
4
Stopped for a starter of roast duck, pork and a nice big beer. How cool is this!!! Loved it - great value, decent food and drinks brought to the table. I liked sharing a table with strangers from all over. Heaps cool!
4
If you want to immerse to the local food and cheap, visit this place.
Be mind on the cleanliness district, if you have OCD, not a good one to visit.
5

This is the place all Foodies must visit if you are passing through Singapore. It is located in Chinatown and you can get there by the Northeast mrt line (NEL; purple line) or the Downtown line (Blue line). The basement has stalls selling fresh vegetables, meat and seafoods. The street level has stalls selling clothes and many other products. But the second level is where the stalls selling various cooked food are located. There are many good food here but do try the Soya Sauce Braised Chicken noodles - it is first class. But you got to be patient - there is usually a very long queue

Came here today for lunch with some colleagues and tried a selection of the stalls. Started with some wonton mee pok noodles from the Fatty Ox HK Kitchen ($4). Then had some traditional Chinese dessert at 115 Tang Shui ($2), then a carrot juice at one of the juice stalls ($2) and finished with a surprisingly decent local coffee from The Fifties coffee stall ($1). Pretty decent value for the price paid. Facilities are pretty basic, but if you don't mind the surroundings there is some decent food to be had here

I had come here a few days before but it was too hot so I had left and was so glad to have come back today.This place is on the second story of the Chinatown complex and has over 250 food stalls.We started off with siew mai at $2.50 for four pieces - nice enough but then we tucked into a taste sensation with the Rojak dish ( $3 ) - simply superb.We then had the hainanese chicken rice which was so tender and had so much taste - $4.All washed down with a large long neck of icy cold singha at $5.A must do experience when in Singapore

This place is rather unique, as it houses 3 different "attractions" over 3 levels within the same building ie a huge Food Centre, a No Frills shops area & a Wet market.1. Huge Food Centre at 2nd floor. Here one can find an amazing range & types of good, authentic local food- and at cheap prices too! Menu & prices are displayed, you just point to what you want if unsure how to order. You can sit anywhere as it is free seating concept.These individual food stalls are usually owned & cooked by the owners themselves. Many of them has been in this biz for a very long time. And one can find really authentic good local hawker food in many of the stalls here. Long queues do give an indication of the popularity but taste is subjective. So just try as many types possible & be guided by what you think looks good. Many tourists do come here to experience good local food at cheap prices. There are also Thai, Japanese & HongKong food too. See photos for some of our recommended favourites.Note that since stalls are usually owner-owned, they do close once a week for rest. Mainly on Mondays/Tuesdays.2. Shops on 1st floor ( ground level). There are many small interesting shops here selling various clothings, shoes, accessories, jewelleries, etc. Nothing fanciful but prices are generally low. Can get good bargains here.3. Wet Market on Basement floor. Many tourists 'missed' this interesting market as it is not prominently visible. Here one can find all sorts of fresh & live seafood (eg live frogs), various meats, vegetables, sundries & fruits. Being a wet market, do expect the floors to be quite wet & the "fishy smell" of fresh seafood & meats lingers on the air. Explore & try the various tropical & imported fruits too.The prices here are very cheap compared to supermarkets.Have seen tourist groups trying out tropical fruits.Chinatown Complex is located on Smith Street (within the street markets area) & is on the same street just few metres away from Chinatown Food Street ( 'tourists' food centre). Exit at Pagoda Street from Chinatown MRT station. Smith Street is 2 streets away from here

I'll review the food centre in due course, but here's the review of the wet market for a start. This is THE go-to market for all sorts of Chinese delicacies. Yong tau foo, to game like frogs and turtles. The spiceman has lovely blends and the dried goods seller has the best selection of cured meats in Singapore. Try out the herbalist
5
There many food centers in Singapore but this one is pretty authentic and worthy of a visit if you are near Chinatown. The choices are overwhelming! It has a mixture of Chinese, Malay, Indian, Thai...dishes to chose from. The fish ball noodle soup is quite popular here. I had a delicious roast duck dish and a Laska noodle soup there. Even if you are not into exotic foods, just being there is a fun and unique experience
5
Singapore food is becoming increasingly sterile, but Chinatown Complex plays hosts to many food stalls that are traditional and genuine to the palate. Unsure of which stalls? Just join the longest queue. The claypot rice stall is excellent - cooked from scratch. There's a chwee kueh stall in the middle of the complex next to a fruit juice stall - heavenly! A visit to Chinatown Complex is always on the cards during every trip
5
Always packed with locals who are very friendly. Lots of good craft beer stalls in one part. Great food too ( I always have the tofu/chicken soup next to Super Mummy Cafe!)
5
There are so many Good,Tasty & Cheap food in this Chinatown Food Center. For Heng Ji Chicken Rice...fresh & Juicy chicken. .Handmade Spring Roll ..Juicy & good....Fishhead cheap & good. Lastly must Try Jia Ji Mei Shi ....Yum cake with Chee cheong Fun.be prepare for long Queue. only $2 per plate. ..than here also Ice kacang ...etc
5
Amazing place where you can find all, but all kinds of Chinese cuisine for pennies. This is more popularly known as the PeopleÂ´s Park Complex and it is right off the MTR Chinatwon station. We had amazing the most expensive Char Sew platter (roasted duck, roasted pork neck, and roasted pork loin) and a couple of beers for only $ 15 US! Again, no frills here but the good Singaporean people keep this place clean and neat
4
We went to this food court 4 times during our stay in Singapore, and we were never disappointed. It's not the most cozy place, so you got to take it for what it is. There's a lot of choices, the food is flavourful and very cheap. We even found craft beer(!) in some of the stalls. This is a great place to get a good and cheap meal in Singapore!
5
Bustling food court with an immense selection of different stalls. It can be a bit overwhelming to find a place to order from at first, but most places serve excellent authentic food. My favorite stall is by far 02-135, as they serve the best pan fried dumplings outside fine dining restaurants anywhere.Other stalls to mention are the ones serving craft beer and a wide selection of imported bottled brew.

With the corporatization of many centrally located food courts, it's sometimes hard to find authentic hawker food in Singapore. If you are a tourist visiting Chinatown and game for a local experience, this is the place to check out. You can still find really good hawker food cooked by people who have been at this for more than a dozen years and at reasonable prices. So many franchised hawker businesses are now run by "hired hands" who didn't grow up eating this type of food and who have no inclination to create an authentic product.All the Singaporean favourites are represented here - chicken rice, satay, laksa, fried carrot cake and oyster omelette, yong tau fu (vegetables and tofu stuffed with fish paste) and Chinese style vegetarian food. There is a lot to choose from. Dine off peak at lunchtime if you want to avoid the crowd from the nearby offices. As with most hawker centers, seating is communal and there is no air conditioning.Some of my favourites are the Cantonese style rice porridge, popiah (a vegetarian spring roll filled with stewed radish, chopped peanuts, hard boiled egg and lettuce) and roast pork or duck with rice. Would also highly recommend "Mini Toast House" - a little bakery that sells the most delicious freshly baked local breads and confectionery. They are just hearing up for Chinese New Year now - had the pineapple tarts today which were really good ($0.70 for 1, $2 for 3 and $14 for a box).The food court is located on the second floor of the building
4
I love the food options here. There are many good food choices here, from Chinese to Japanese to Korean, and even Western and Muslim food. Chinatown complex food centre still offers unbeatable prices for patrons. You get to eat delicious cuisine from various Chinese ethnic groups, all under one setting. There are some famous food options, such as the hot desserts (almond, red bean soup, sesame paste), roast chicken rice, wanton mee, fried dough, yam cake and pastries, and the list goes on. Worth a visit anytime in the day
5
The range of food available is amazing. The prices are extremely reasonable. Popiah, Chicken Rice, Braised Duck, Hongkong Dimsum, Roast Meats, Soya Chicken and walnut paste are things for which I return every week. Go here if you want great food, not if you expect ambience.
5
Chinatown is a must. May it be for shopping,eating,drinking this is the place. People watch heaven and wonderful afforable clothing, great for buying presents . The food is fantastic, anything goes, chilli crab is outstanding, but beware you will need a lot of wipes, very messey indeed. It can get very busy so try to stay away at peak times if possible. Wonderful for photos
4
Dine at this place regularly when in Singapore. 50+ choices of fare ranging from Chinese/Malaysian/Thai/Bakery/Beer/Juices/Tea/coffee. Basic Table/chair setup, prepare to share your table, service is fast and friendly and the food is above average at the 10 or so stalls I have visited. I would recommend this place to anyone whos not afraid to get amongst the average local population who eat here, mostly workers in the area with a smattering of tourists. You will get out of here with a full stomach and a smile, and 2 meals plus 2 non alcoholic drinks will set you back less than $15 and sometimes less than $10. Highly recommended
4
Ate here as the famous Maxwell Hawker Centre was closed for the week. Many good choices. The duck was very good.
4
Real Chinese food at a decent cost. There is A LOT to chose from and even if your not that hungry there is smaller snacks to eat. A must to try!
4
I came with my family and planned to buy souvenirs here.The food offered in Chinatown complex are vary. There are snacks, various drinks, and also foods. The place actually not so comfortable to eat, I prefer to take out.
4
Looking for cheap and clean foods? Chinatown complex, foodcourt is on 2nd floor is highly recommended. Meals would cost starting SGD 2.5. As for the drinks, there are as cheapest as SGD 1.2
4
If you are checking out Chinatown then this is the place to stop for a quick bite. Tons of stalls to chose from. On the second and third floor , you can find cheap toiletries way cheaper than retail stores and also some clothing shops selling office lady dresses at decent prices.
4
we visited this complex to grab some daily stuff on a visit to tooth relic temmple.This complex is just opposite to the temple and you would not visit it.This was a regular shopping mall with cheap chinese stuff all around.We grabbed some beer (at lesser cost) and some gifts.There are a lot of chinese restaurants filled with singapore-chinese people
5
Great hawker centre with endless selections of Chinese food! My favorite are penang laksa (SGD4) at Nanu and pork bun (SGD2.20 for 3 buns) at Hong Kong Dim Sim. We had a bit of difficulty finding various laksa shops, but it was a great place for yummy & cheap food. Some of the shops will start closing after 5pm and most of the shops were closed/closing around 10pm

Singapore is famous for its many local food. If you want to try many types of good local food & at cheap prices, this is the best place.This huge 2nd floor food ( hawker ) centre offers so much varieties & choices of good & cheap local food. It would be a great pity to miss 'trying out' good local food here. It is located in the heart of Chinatown, in Smith Street (near the street markets).To get here, take exit to Pagoda Street ( think it is Exit B) at Chinatown MRT station. Smith Street is just 2 streets away.The menu & food prices are clearly indicated on each stall, so you know exactly the prices & what are the food available. You can buy your food & seat anywhere . Besides local food, there are also some unique stalls selling Japanese, Thai & Taiwanese food. Some authentic local food that should be tried include chicken rice, fried kway teow (noodles), fish ball noodles, wanton (dumplings) noodles, roasted duck, Malay food, local desserts. Of course there will be more than one stall selling similar food. Some will be better than others. Highly recommend the following Unique food which are our regular favourites; besides others local food.1. Babas Peranakan at stall nos #02-225. Authentic, excellent & delicious Peranakan food ( see my separate reviews). Long daily queues, sells out very fast. Come before 12.00pm if you want chance to try full range . Closed on Wednesdays.2. Kazan Japanese Cuisine at unit#02-001. Authentic Japanese food at food court prices ( see my separate review). Closed on Saturdays.3. Bangkok Thai Food. Good authentic Thai food, with wide menu (see my separate reviews). Owned & cooked by Thai nationals. Have recently moved from Unit# 02-121 to nearby #02-117. There are few Thai stalls here, so don't be mistaken.4. Taiwanese Cuisine. Authentic good Taiwanese food, owned & cooked by Taiwanese family. Excellent find. Wide choices of food at very low prices. Stall number is #02-022, it is just directly across Baba Peranakan. Closed on Tuesdays.Enjoy eating!
5
Don't be put off by the less than attractive building, this is hawker food at it's best. So much variety, so many different cuisines, lots of family run stalls. Load up, grab a seat at the communal tables and enjoy! A highlight of our visit to Singapore for a tiny price
5
If you are a foodie then you will know the hawker food markets are where you find good Singapore food and where the locals eat. This one is on the second floor of a concrete building that doesnt really scream "delicious food upstairs!", but it should...You enter on the ground floor through a general market of tourist tat and some fruit and vege stalls. The good stuff is on the next floor up.The ambience is pretty much like dining in a car parking building- no windows or aircon, but there are some ceiling fans, so choose a seat under one of them. There is a maze of food stalls, all selling different specialities at cheap, cheap prices.Do some research on one of the many helpful Singapore food blogs if you want to tick off a few must-eats. There is a famous chicken rice stall here and many others have strong local followings- just look for stalls with queues.We opted for roast duck served on rice or porridge by a very little old lady wielding a massive cleaver. Delicious and only a couple of dollars. Dont forget a fresh fruit juice too
4
many old uncles and aunties been there for decades continuing to keep up with producing good food to their regular customers
4
Very good. lok for ther food stalls with an A or B on their sign. This means that they have a good standard of hygiene and the food will be safe to eat.
4
Great variety of bargains and souvenirs. I spent all my money on gifts for friends and family, as well as some nice jewellery for me. worth the visit
5
Tian Tian Chicken rice was too remarkable. I've never had such smooth chicken meat like this. I have also tried prawn noodles. It was also good. Drinks were cheap and full of varieties. Though a bit hot.
5
Okay if you are a foodie then I am not surprised that you are in Singapore (because one thing this place is famous for is its food, especially the hawker's markets). While this was not my first experience of such a place, it is where I came to appreciate them in all their wander. In fact, after coming here if there happened to be a hawkers centre in my path I would make a detour for a visit. In a way this is where the modern food hall comes from, only they are heaps better in that you don't just visit one stall, you visit multiple and then set yourself up for a feast. The food is cheap, and also pretty good. The ground floor is basically an extension of the Chinatown markets, and the ground floor is where you do your food shopping, however it is the second floor where you come for your feast. While you are here, make sure you check out Smith Street Taps and the Good Beer Company (though they only open after six pm)

This infamous hawker centre is a MUST VISIT food haunt when you are in Singapore'a Chinatown.The metro is only a few streets away. It is a hive and bustling place at night. A good place to stay as there are numerous hotels to pick from. From Changi airport after a short travel just change line to Chinatown metro station.As the name implies Chinatown offer you Chinese food from zichar, a simple smaller scale restaurant offering.Though our Government has tried its best with high ceiling and fans wear thin COTTON clothes as you perspire from our Equatorial climate.Anji stall offers their infamous beehoon thick fish broth with cut pieces of fish head slightly fried. Eat it with chilli padi, small cut spicy chilli and with every combination of beehoon and fish meat you are in food heaven.It also offer various fried Chinese dishes such as bitter gourd with beef, pork ribs. The infamous steam spicy fish head never miss as families flock here for it. Many of its competitors offer this too amidst other good dishes.The local soothing drink of crushed sugarcane and whole coconut is good refreshing and cooling.Claypot rice stalls are abundant namely the original Smith street tucked at a corner after the escalator on the right where its chicken is more moist and Lian He is a long wait. The waiting is testing your patience so while waiting order Rojak ( mixed vegetable and fruit salad mixed in shrimp paste and chilli) for starter. To end your meal spoil yourself with ice kachang crush ice with syrups of different colours and top with lots lots red bean and peanuts.You can walk out of the complex feeling very cool to hunt for your choice of souveniurs from tshirt to keychains to momentos of Singapore for only S$10 for 3 or 5
5
Singapore our last stop in our backpacking experience in asia (april 2015)this will be the best place to eat and shop.. and of course there are mini hotels and guesthouse that you can choose from.there are so many restaurants and food stall that you can you can try all foods are delicious and cheap..wanting to go back there.Sales are everywhere especially for souvenir items.. like $10 SGD for 5 tshirts etc.make sure to bring a lot of money ,, and your luggage will not be overweight ( because we are)very convenient bec just a few blocks from the metro statio
5
This hawker centre has many stalls whose children chose not to carry on their business. Stalls like soy sauce chicken, pork liver porridge, claypot rice, wanton mee, song fish head are must tries. Just jump into the bandwagon where queue are, and you won't be disappointed. If you want to have a good cup of coffee, do try the one with long queue just beside an escalator
5
This is our favourite food centre in Singapore. We come here at least once a week, often more.This is probably one of the biggest food centre. There are so many varieties & choices here. And generally you can find many good food at very reasonable prices. The food centre is on the 2nd floor. There is a wet market in basement.There are few favourites of ours; most are pretty popular as well and tastes great. I can't remember all their exact full names or their actual names but will be no problem identifying them from my descriptions below.1. Golden Dragon Hainanese curry rice. Elderly lady owner.2. Bangkok Jam ( authentic Thai food; male cook & owner - located opposite Golden Dragon). Seems to be only Thai food stall here)3. Damn Nice curry rice. Located behind the area of no 6 Roast duck stall. Mother & son stall.4. Malay nasi padang- about 2 stalls away from Damn nice curry rice - on the opposite side. Owned by a couple. Next to a drink stall.5. Kazan ( Japanese cuisine). Its located behind. The owner is a young man, very friendly. Need to look for it.6. Roast duck/pork & char siew rice & noodle ( go up the main entrance escalator - its on the left side, the last stall at right corner ). You can't miss it as there is only one such stall in that part.7. Baba Peranakan food/rice. Very authentic, very nice & extremely popular. The cooks/owner are males.7. Various Che zhar stalls (restaurant style dishes/food - most are located next to each other/together right behind. If you have time, go to the Wet market at basement. The fresh/raw food & fruits here are very fresh & cheap as compared to other wet markets.Highly recommended to tourists who wants to try good and/or authentic local food at reasonable prices. Including Thai/Japanese food. In fact it is not uncommon to see foreigners here
4
my husband and i ate here nearly everyday during our holiday as it was right down the road from the hotel we were staying at.. its very good, good selection of food and cheap. even found a little micro brewery stall which was fantastic. remember to make a note of where you come up, as this place it a maze.
5
Go to Smith Street in Chinatown and up to the second level and you will find fantastic local cuisine. Try the milk shake juice house for the best mango milk shakes.
4
A great place to try all sorts of street food favorites, not just chinese food. I reconmend trying the black pepper beef. Wash it down with some refreshing chendol for dessert.
4
There's a lot to choose from and not only (strictly) Chinese food, but also Perenakan, Thai, Malay, Indian, even Japanese! The popiah are definitely a must-try, as well as other local delicacies like the fried carrot cake or the chendol. Prices are cheap when compared to average restaurant prices. Go with an empty stomach and don't stick to only one stall - the beauty of the experience is to try as many as you can, even if it's noisy and food is served on plastic or styrofoam plates
4
If you want to taste Singapore's famed food, look no further. Although it is quite expensive compared to hawker centers, you get to choose from a variety of their best dishes and the menu is in English. Most service staff speak English too. We tried the Chili Crab and Roasted Chicken Rice and was satisfied. Paid S$68.00 for a 680g crab. Roasted Ckn Rice Set was at S$10. It was humid so better come in loose clothing.
5
Singapore is an expensive city, you can eat wonderful food at high prices and also pay a lot for average food. In this hawker, I enjoyed a lot since food was delicious and cheap. Beer is significantly cheaper, since you can buy it from 6-6.5 SDG while in a restaurant it will not be under 10-12 SDG. We had xia-lon-bao, hainan chicken, sate, seafood malaysian noodles... everything was delicious and found the food to be authentic.Place is not super clean but a certain hygiene level is ensured. Tables are often cleaned and electric fans are making you felling colder.Totally recommended
3
Perhaps not the best of the best, but it has a lot of stalls for you to choose.As a person from Malaysia, I only choose to eat food that is unique in Singapore.I had their Lor Mee with SHARK NUGGETS. No joke, is SHARK nuggets.I also bought 水糕! 4 pieces for $1. Damn cheap and it taste very heavenly.Look out for this stall, is beside a fruit juice stall.The signboard of the stall is just a plain white background with red wordings mainly in Chinese and English.Super recommended
4
Whilst doing a walking tour of the Chinatown area I came across the Chinatown Complex.It is always a delight to go where the locals go! Here you will find a 3 story building. I started off on a ground floor which might be too much for some to stomach. Firstly you certainly need to watch your step as you are walking down either the stairs or the ramp into the basement area. This is a wet market!! So there is live fish being prepared for sale and water and blood and guts flowing all over the place, certainly in the one section!This of course if necessary in such a place for this type of food sales. The basement offer a huge variety of fish for sale at very cheap prices. There is also a large flower section down there. The ground floor level holds probably 60 or 70 (maybe more) small stores selling everything from cosmetics to suitcases. On the top floor is a large local food court! Very reasonably priced and authentically cooked local food.The Chinatown Complex is definitely worth a visit if you are in the neighborhood and want to see where and how the local Singaporean Chinese shop and dine
5
Chinatown food complex is one of the few famous Hawkers food outlets any foodie would love to visit. Yes theres lack of english but pointing is fine since theres pictures and displays of their signature dishes.Each stall has their own speciality and heaps cheap ranging $3 to $10 depends whats been ordered.Make sure you order1. ice milk tea or coffee (since its always humid)2. fruitshakes3. Hainanese chicken rice or noodles4. Soy chicken rice5. Bbq pork & porkbelly rice/noodlesand try everything if you can ...but be warn for those weak stomachs ... there is no such thing is a temperture safety point, so quiet possible food poisoning however their graded on their Hygiene.... A B 
5
Cheap food with lots to choose from! Seriously, there are so many stalls that I spent almost half an hour going round and round choosing the one that I would really like to eat. It's the best place to blend and experience like the locals. If you don't know how to speak Chinese, you don't have to worry. Just point whatever you like
5
Huge food court, with hundreds of stalls and a huge sitting area. Everyone will find great food in all categories - soups, meats, fruits and juices, desserts, seafood - its all here, very affordable and really tasty. Most if it is Chinese food, but there are Muslim stalls (similar to Indian and Malay Muslim cuisine) and western food as well
4
All stuff here are very cheap !! I like to have lunch in this foodcourt because good and cheap.. We can also buy cheap goods here by walking.. This place is very strategic for being an close to mrt Chinatown.
4
Loved the experience of wandering through the Food court/hawker centre in the Chinatown Complex! The stalls go on for ever! So many different types of food to choose from - we ended up sharing a few different dishes, including breakfast pancakes (much more authentic than the name suggests and very delicious), beef ball noodle soup (amazing!), kopi and freshly crushed sugar cane. It is hot, noisy, crowded and smelly, but that was all part of the fun! Be prepared to sit down next to a stranger to share a filthy table, but also be prepared to try some fantastically tasty food - just like the locals do! Everything looks a bit more 'rugged' than what we are used to at home, but not once did we have any problems with an upset tummy.

This is a huge food court on the second floor of 335 Smith Street. There were so many stalls that it can be a little overwhelming. It’s semi-enclosed, so no air conditioning that I could feel – just large fans. I’m not used to the heat, so I was not that comfortable there. We got to the complex at about 11 and many of the places had not opened yet. My SO settled on some roasted meats (pork) with rice (didn’t write down the name of the stall) and I tried the Hill Street Fried Kway Teow. We both liked our dishes. You may want to check OpenRice.com and find the Chinatown Complex to see what people have recommended. We just wandered around. We didn't see that many tourists here; it was mostly local people but we may have been there too early
4
Really a worthwhile food center. Pretty crowded and quite hot but the variety of food stalls is incredulous.Many place offer pork rib soups and I recommend trying some out. The meat is so tender it just melts. Wash the soup down with some sugarcane+lemon juice
3
If you want to try out all kind of Singaporean local dishes, here you go. A single food centre with all kind of mix...from fish soup, fishball, to chili crabs, Sichuan mala spicy steamboat...Personal recommendation at this location: + sugarcane: happy (a very small store only selling sugarcane...pure, clean, BIG and it is $1.5
2
Lot's of different eating options on the main street of Chinatown, we were a bit unlucky with the stand we chose to buy from since only the rice were edible. The beef was too soft and strange texture and the fish we ordered were as well rather strange texture. Great to experience how the locals eat, though, and the food is very cheap, probably the reason why the quality was inferior
5
This is a 2-storey complex (with basement) situated next to Buddha Tooth Museum. It has a big sign that says "Chinatown Food Complex" at the entrance when you are standing facing it with the Museum on your left.The basement is a local wet market that sells fresh meat, vegetables and fruits. The ground floor consists of a mixture of shops selling a variety of goods such as sundries, cosmetics, CDs, clothes, antiques, clocks, watches, jewellery, religious artifacts and tailors.To me, what's interesting and should not be missed is the first storey which is the food centre. Here you have an amazing mix of food stalls selling almost every type of mostly Chinese food - chicken rice, duck rice, roast pork, noodles, clayopot dishes, fishhead, dim sum, satay, rojak,, porridge, desserts etc - you name it, they probably have it. There are also a handful of stalls selling non-Chinese food such as Malay and Indian food and Japanese food. All food are sold at very competitive prices which are clearly set out on the signboards on each stall. This place tends to get quite crowded during lunchtime as this is a favourite haunt for nearby office workers. Nonetheless, due to the size of the place, you can still find seats. Be prepared to sweat a bit though on a hot day but the numerous fans throughout should help.If you are a tourist, I suggest you move around the place and see the variety of food on sale. You will also see queues of people at the more popular stalls. If you are not sure of any type of food, go ask the stall holder or any person and chances are that you will receive helpful tips. You are free to sit anywhere regardless of where you order your food. Most stalls are self-service i.e. you carry your own food instead of being served.I have read a couple of unfavourable reviews here but those (as you can tell from the specific addresses) were for restaurants located along the streets outside and not for stalls within this food complex. A case of mistaken identity, and it is a pity that they are not corrected yet.I'm surprised that there are not more tourists here
4
Ok so it isn't as polished as your ubiquitous Food Republic hawker centres in Orchard Toad, but this place has some pretty decent food at remarkably low prices. Fresh fruit juice at just $2.20 each and noodles with roast duck slices for $3. Particularly liked the Emerald Soy Sauce Chicken outlet. Well worth a visit
4
Always visit here for lunch. This place is very big and each hawker stalls sells different types of singapore famous food for eg. Hokkien mee, laksa, char kueh teow and so on.... And the price here is very cheap here. A good place for tourist to explore singapore foo
4
We found this place by chance when looking for somewhere for lunch and was pleasantly surprised. There was loads of various stalls each selling different food. As a vegetarian it can be hard to fins something in places like this or you aren't sure what you are eating and if its meat free! I found a place that sold vegetarian food. I could choose from brown or white rice, had a choice of 3/4 options. Mostly it was tofu with some mushrooms and other things. I usually like to know what I'm eating but i just chose 3 foods that looked great and it was £2.50 and my plate was full. I enjoyed what i had and would defo recommend here. My husband had some fish, curry, rice and a pudding all for about £4. Very cheap. Loads of tables to sit and have lunch and alot of locals come here too
5
Easy to get to from our hotel, many vendors keen for you to try their cuisine, had some wonderful food experiences very reasonably priced, and the long cool Tiger beer very refreshing after a days Gad about
4
The foodcourt open since 7am, so it's convenient to get breakfast here.
I tried Xiu Ji Ikan Bilis Yong Tau Foo and Tong Kee cooked food.
They are tasty and cheap.
5
This is a prime example of the variety and deliciousness of the hawker scene in Singapore. Utterly cheap and utterly delicious. Prepared to be overwhelmed though -both by the sheer magnitude and aroma of the place.
5
Great place to buy cheap stuffs to bring back home...
Food are also cheap nice place also sorrounds by full of historical buildings...
4
This Complex has a wet market in the basement, sundry clothes and souvenir shops on the ground floor, a great collection of street-foods on the second floor and car-parks on the 3rd& 4th floors.Not much to talk about, except for the wide selection of mainly Singapore Chinese food stalls on the 2nd Flr.Wow, what a collection of delicious yummy eateries- all kinds of soups, including the unique turtle soup, roast meats, soy sauce chicken, fried rice noodles, wanton noodles, clay pot rice, popiah, the popular steamed fish head, desserts, steamed buns, satay and more.Great place to eat and at very reasonable prices. However, cleanliness somewhat lacking, especially during peak hours, as tables are not cleared up quickly enough.Great for tourists as well, who can rub shoulders with the predominantly Chinese crowd, some of whom are the more elderly senior citizens, enjoying their lunch or dinner. Can be hot & humid, depending on where you are seated.

Having been to Singapore twice now, the Chinatown food complex is always high on my list of hawker centres to visit.Whilst most of the guidebooks and blogs rarely put this place in the top 5, overall I think ChinatownFC deserves a much better reputation.Like most centres there is something for everyone here. Although it should be noted that there are several pure vegetarian stalls here, which maxwell is missing.For me the atmosphere is better the food is better and the prices are generally cheaper.Aside from food there is also wet market (as well as veg/flowers) at the basement and some cheap clothing/miscellaneous stores on the ground floor.All the food stalls are on the second floor (lift access available) and I highly recommend the char kway teow at stall #02-173, IMHO the best KT in town.It sits opposite the square behind the big temple so makes an easy stop after walking the streets of Chinatown.Eat Here

Cheap shopping for all your tourist needs....Men's shirts are cheap around 18 sng for two... 100% cotton.. Recommend if you are able to visit more than once prices will vary as we discovered with some silk embroidery pictures. One stall wanted 90sng for large 60sng for small..we ended up getting 2 small for 50 sng... So girls do your shopping carefully..and don't forget to barter a little. I never pay the asking price...unless it is hand crafted on the spot. Most stalls holders are happy to discount...plenty stall holders have the same things. I always have fun...I hope you will too. Thanks for reading my review..have a great holiday

Having found the Maxwell road hawker centre a bit lacklustre, this was a welcome change. The choice of food is fantastic and brilliant value. Had some great chicken and noodles and also some popiah. Lots of choice but easy to figure out the best places to eat as they have a huge queue
4
Unfortunately I can't find individual places to review, but we went to one of the indoor restaurants with AC. Service was generally fine but the staff kept pushing us to get the larger expensive dishes when we only wanted a couple of small ones, so stand your ground and confirm with them what you've ordered (the receipt was written in kanji so definitely ask). Beer was refreshing and not so expensive for Singapore. The food was nicely prepared though, and they took credit card, so overall a pleasant dinner
4
I thought I'd give this a go and followed some locals in. The variety was amazing and the dish I had excellent. I enjoyed the chat with the chef. I will go back. Do no expect fine dining here. It's a food hall. But the food is terrific and cheap
3
When you want great buys, chinatown is the place to be. But not known to many this area serves yummy yet cheap food too!
3
dimsum overload! the best dimsums I have ever tasted. they only thing I didn't enjoy is the place is a bit crowded. the next we visit, I will make we do nothave next appointment.
3
Eating yummy foodies for $5 complete meal is such a bang! Well, most of the stalls here serves Asian foods and I love it so much.
5
We ate at the second floor outlet at Shop #02-101 and it was great. All meals are $2.20 and great value for quality dim sum and a great selection. They also have more of a restaurant style premises on the ground floor across from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple at 5 Banda Street shop 01-52
4
We went there for lunch. It's a very nice and particular experience. You must chose one kiosk, sit down and observe all the people that animate this confusional but incredible place. People are very very Kind! Take your camera and be ready for a unforgetable Lunch...all for max 6 singapore dollars ( for 2 people
5
I'm not even going to pretend that I know the names of the stalls I visited at the Chinatown Food Complex. In what I think is the farthest corner from the main entrance near the CK store, there's a place that serves wonderful seafood dishes. The wok flavor is amazing. We had chow fun as well as a seafood claypot and both were very tasty.On the exact opposite end from this stall, there are two stalls that serve traditional hot deserts that include peanut paste, walnut paste an sesame paste. At both of these stalls, you get a good sized serving of paste at an extraordinarily low price. There's a well-regarded desert store quite nearby, with stores both on the street near the Chinatown Food Complex and another in the basement of the Chinatown Point Shopping Center. They charge twice as much as these stalls and, quite honestly, after tasting the less expensive ones, I would never go back to the more famous store. Their paste is good, don't get me wrong, but it's far sweeter in comparison
5
The only disappointing aspect of discovering this place for lunch was the fact that I was heading to the airport afterwards! After three nights in Chinatown and eating at various other places nearby, this turned out to be the best vegetarian option.Located near the Buddha Tooth Relic, the second floor has a wide variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian stalls. A delicious rice dish with various vegetables and mock meats was a steal at only $3.Overhead fans kept the sweat to a minimum, and the dining area was reasonably clean. Many locals were dining here and the stall owner was very personable.A highly recommended eatery; this will be my first choice next time I visit Singapore
4
This food centre houses many preferred local Chinese food stores in Singapore. Just to name a few, pork porridge served with raw fish, steam fish head, fish head noodles soup, Yong Tau Fu, minced pork noodles, clay-pot rice, soya sauce chicken rice and noodles. Food served here are reasonably priced, probably amongst the cheapest in Singapore but of very high quality in terms of authenticity and taste. Some stores are around for more than 30 years and yet still going strong. Certainly one of my favourite food haunt in Singapore
5
The food court houses a stall that attracts long queues all the time. It is a food stall dealing in boiled stuffed vegetables with fish paste - Yong Tau Foo. I can't remember the lot number exactly, but you can ask around as the shop is located right next to the toilet, yes next to the toilet. Don't expect much service and you certainly can't chose what you like, but nevertheless everything here's great.There used to be a great Tang Yuan ( boiled stuffed rice ball dessert) place but unfortunately, the shop closed after the proprietor passed away
5
A 3 storey complex housing a market, dry goods/grocery section and the food floor!Great variety, a very busy place. Excellent value, why pay silly prices a block away when you can eat here?Stand and watch as your food is prepared. From soups and noodles to rice and dumplings, something for everyone and beer available too
4
I had an excellent great frog porridge in a claypot. Very good for its price definitely. Cheap food with massive varieties. Too bad I didn't have 4 stomachs..
5
Food that is cheap & great tasting can be found inside this place. Average spending excluding drinks is about S$3 to S$3.50.
4
You can find things you need such as good restaurants, Fair Price supermarket, money exchange. There is a bridge connected to the People's Park Building opposite of the wide road..the Building sells several local products esp. Chinese herbal medicines
4
Decided to visit the food complex after previous recommendations from family and we weren't let down. It's definitely a place where all the locals go and it's not surprising with the great food and cheap prices! One store we went to 'Hong Kong soya sauce chicken rice and noodle' gave us a huge plate of their speciality for only $2 and another place did a garlic chicken set with rice for $4, it all tasted amazing! As long as you keep an eye out for the food hygiene rating and look for the busy stores, it's definitely a place to visit when in town
5
As others have said, it's mainly for locals. Follow the queues for popular places. Try 02-126, the Hongkong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and Noodles stall. S$2 for chicken and rice. You can order any combination of choices, for example put BBQ pork and char siew over noodles or rice. Dumplings also nice. For S$5.50, we had more than 2 people could handle for lunch. See wet market on lower floor for good photo ops.
5
This place is a bit hard to find & we nearly stopped at the nearby Smit St "tourist" restaurants but are so glad we persevered. The ground floor is just more more clothes etc stalls but take the elevator up to the second floor and discover cheap food heaven! However, having said that the choice is overwhelming. I had a few recommended stalls (can't remember where I saw the recommendations) but we lucked out with a fnumber of them the two times we went there as they were closed or had moved. However we did try stall #02-135 (Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao) the two times we went (ie lunch and dinner on different days). Try the dumplings (we tried them both fried and steamed) and at S$5.50 for 10 they are really good value. We tried a few other stalls but they weren't notable enough for us to have noted the number.We also tried the Good Beer Company stall (#02-58) - these guys are amazing and will look at the food you are eating and suggest the appropriate beer from their huge range to match your food. At S$10-12, the beer is more expensive than the food, but they are imported and it's great to chat to the guys on the stall who are really friendly and helpful about beer, food and Singapore.The place is quite hot during the day and we didn't see a lot of other obvious tourists but I would highly recommend trying this place as I believe it is one of the better hawker food centres in Singapore
4
This complex is a short walk from Chinatown MRT station. You wouldn’t normally find this place, it is a little ‘off the beaten track’, it’s not for all tourists, more locals and keen hawker foodies. At first the complex is a little dark and dreary, but the food stalls are plenty and the food is extremely fresh. The price of food is really affordable and very quick to cook. The average dish is approximately $2.50AUD and the best chicken rice dish is available here – but be quick as once the food sells out they close up shop in this complex.I will definitely be back
5
If you like your Asian food then forget all the touristy places and head here! We found this place almost by accident after walking through the covered street and not being particularly inspired. The Chinatown Complex is a massive array - almost a maze - of hawker stalls crammed onto the 2nd floor above a level of standard Chinatown type market stalls. Good luck choosing one to dine at because whatever food you're in the mood for you'll likely find a dozen stalls that make it. (probably 3 dozen if chicken rice is your thing). My partner & I went with a Sichuan place that had wontons for $4 and spicy noodles also for $4, and both were amazingly good. You gotta check this place out.
5
Smith Street in Chinatown is a covered street full of restaurants and reasonably priced food stalls that sell everything from satay to Roast Duck with rice costing around a few pounds. You can buy things from various stalls and grab a table anywhere to enjoy the fabulous food. You are really spoiled for choice, and we decided to eat in one of the restaurants (the only English translation on it was Huinan Chinese Restaurant). This was more expensive than the stalls but was one of the best chinese meals I have ever tasted so was worth every penny. We had Chilli crab which came in a casserole dish laced with lots of garlic, chilli, potatoes and crab claws and legs- very messy but absolutely delicious. Salt and pepper prawns tasted fresh with a crisp batter and spicy chilli fried rice. In total or bill was around £50 including drinks. It was lovely having an outside table to enjoy the Smith Street atmosphere- incredible
3
The food was generally good but could have been better with advice from locals. On the other hand, the drinks were terrible and the fruit juice had more water and ice than actual juice. I suggest getting drinks at a nearby 7-11 and coming here only for the food
5
My office friend brought me here for lunch, it was packed with office workers and some famous eateries/restaurants had a long queue. But I like it, the food is good, the environment was authentic and leave your suit/jackets, ready to sweat.....
4
The place is big and very lively. Great variety and great food. At some point I did't know what I was eating exactly. All the dishes I tried were great though. Strongly recommend the place. It is a great experience
5
I have many good experience in Chinatown Complex! I really love the hawker center! 海南雞飯 椰糖紅豆冰 生魚片 KOPI there are too many choices with reasonable price! You can definitely enjoy local food and have excellent experience of eating in hawker center!
4
I love the food centres in Singapore! The Chinatown food centre is no exception. A great variety of dishes to choose from. So cheap. The most I ever paid for a meal is $4.00.Find the stall with the longest line of locals and get in the queue....just order whatever they're having and you can't go wrong. A great way to broaden your food horizons.I wish I could remember the stall no. for the dumpling lady I visited one morning. They were fabulous!Even more interesting to me than the food court is the wet market downstairs. Do yourself a favour and explore the stalls of fresh local produce and spices etc
5
As it was Chinese New Year Day a lot of the stalls were not open however the evidence of the previous night partying was very clear. Having cleared ourselves a table we then had dinner and drinks for three for about $12 AUD. Not exactly sure what we were eating but it tasted great. A 'must do' on a list of things to do in Chinatown
4
Night markets in Asia can be chaotic and this is no different! Eating is great, the prices cant be beaten and a bargain by Singapore standards. I love ice kachang and it's about the only place to go, and for $S1.50 you cant complain! Small custard tarts are available for the same price. Communal seating and you can eat with the locals
5
I've been to a number of "Chinatowns" and the one in Singapore is probably the most interesting, so far. Great food, all sorts of stuff to buy, and lots of decent places to stay. And for an area that's so crowded, it is surprisingly safe and clean. I was also in Singapore back in October 2013, and now I realize how incomplete that trip was because I never made a stop there that time
5
make an effort & arrive here@ 7am, & breakfast is waiting for you...porridge for example.come at lunch time & be prepared to queue up for popular stalls...but who is complaining?dinner time & be amazed@ how many parents bring their children here to dine family style & this place is power packed with different STYLES OF COOKING, with different PALATES OF TASTES, & best of all, different PRICES so please choose wisely!!
5
We ate at Hong Kong Mongkut Tim Sum (learned that tim sum =dim sum). With the advice of a woman sitting at our communal table, we ordered several things. The food was good, but the experience better. The top floor of this building offers hundreds of options to eat. Take your pick! Before or after, visit the bottom floors, and see the vegetable and fruit market, and the seafood market. Overall it is a must-see in Chinatown
4
We had a good time trying many kinds of food in Chinatown Complex Food Centre. Each of us ordered differently. I had a bowl of porridge with roast duck which cost 3 dollars in Run Ji Cooked Food. Before I ate, I wondered if it would be tasty because it did not have a good look . I thought the duck would be bland cause every piece was soaked in tasteless porridge. I couldn’t see anything on the surface except some chopped green onion. However, I found it unexpectedly delicious. The duck hidden was filled with appropriated sauce , which was extremely wonderful. The miraculous taste could be distinguished easily from the taste of the porridge which was a little salty. Although it looked ordinary, I suspected if there was some secret ingredients to make up its unique taste! Pu Xiang Vegetarian might be the best place to eat for the only vegetarian of us.After eating a big lunch included three kinds of vegetables and a bowl of rice, she was full and pretty saticfied.There was something like meat in the dish,but they were not meat -- they were tofu.She said those tofu was very delicious because the sauce tasted fresh and salty,and the tofu itself was so soft that it melted immediately after she put it into her mouth .It had the flavour of fish and eggs,too.Besides tofu,the green bean,mushroom and cabbage all tasted very awesome,just like the homemade food.The rice was neither too sticky nor too dry,and had a faint scent.She said she would like to eat that the next time when she come to Chinatown,because it's not only very delicious but cheap enough.The meal only cost her $2.5.Isn't it great? That girl also bought a bowl of rice porridge which cost her 1 dollar at the same store as where I bought my porridge,without any quelite.Actually she said eating that kind of porridge was an amazing experience.Although she had not gotten used to salty porridge,the mouthfeel of boiled rice was pretty good.I thought it would taste better if she added some condiment like chopped green onion or soy .I didn't really enjoy that pure rice porridge. I think most of people will love meat porridge of other kinds of porridge rather than the porridge she ate that day.Spring Roll is famous , so we tried it . However, we were not very satisfied with it. Although the exterior part was crispy and the interior part was soft, it was tasteless. It didn’t have any characteristic which could attract us. The taste was forgettable, so now we can hardly remember it. We also tried drinks. One of us bought a cup of coffee in Tai Hwa Coffee. it tasted pure and aromatic, and was steaming violently. The cook used a traditional way to make it. He stretched his arms, held the cup in his left hand and held a full mug of coffee in his right hand, and poured the coffee into the cup. The hot coffee looked like a magnificent fall dropping from a big lake. Maybe it was used to mix up the coffee perfectly. All of us liked it. The girl who ordered a cup of coffee also bought a portion of pock belles casserole.She enjoyed that a lot.She said there was a strong taste of meat and bones in the soup,and that made the pock belles more tasty.The pock belles were tenacious,but not very hard because they were stewed properly.It really had the taste of traditional Chinese casserole food,and she thought most of Chinese tourists will love it if they go there to eat.I tasted it a little and I loved the flavour of the soup.I felt that all the food in this hawker centre is more tasty than I thought,and it reminded me of our homeland China
4
Like the Fish noodle soup, value for money
Clearing of bowls & plates and cleaning the table are not done well. The cleaners have to be re trained to ensure tables are wiped clean & dry for next customer.
3
Look a bit mess around there but i saw a lot of old man come to drink, smoke, play chess. It look like daily life of Singapore citizen in China Town. Quite good to visit.
3
The place is hot, finding a place is quite a chore during peak hours but wide selection of local food at very reasonable prices.
4
Great atmosphere and wide selection of food. Eaten several times here with no problem-would certainly recommend.

On the very day we landed in Singapore we stepped out for sight seeing & for our first meal in Singapore.We were very clear that in a limited stay if we had to taste the Singapore food, which is like a big cauldron with Chinese, Malay, Indian & other asian country influence, no other better place than a hawker centre.Location : Very close to Chinatown MRT. Follow directions in the station & you will come out in the touristy Chinatown sector. From this place Chinatown Complex is just 10-12 minutes walk. Its a commercial complex with various markets on Ground & 1st floor, food court on 2nd & then residential apartments. Food court is spread over as per the building structure so unlike other hawker centres you will not get exact idea of the number of stalls till you go around in this maze for good 10 minutes.Interesting part of this location is that you will find elderly chinese playing board games just outside this complex. Its interesting site that two of them will be playing but there will be at least 2/3 spectators who would be patiently standing next to a player and following the game. The whole lot will be smoking rolled cigarettes. This was the real taste of Chinatown for me. Food : Being first day and after 10 hours of flight & airport waiting we didn't explore this place completely. We reached around 2.30 pm post the office lunch time but still there was hustle bustle. We tried fish ball noodle soup, oyster omelette, dragon fruit juice. There were many stalls selling BBQ wings, chicken, pork etc. However, the highlight was HongKong Soy Chicken set. We were having most of the dishes for the first time so we didn't know what to expect. However, the soy chicken was bustling with explosion of mild flavours and moist chicken. Chicken had a sweetish but amazing taste. This set came with small portion of rice & bit of greens and two different types of chicken. Even at 2.30 pm there was a queue at this stall & although the stall owner was not able to speak in English, thanks to the colourful photos, I could place my order successfully.Verdict/Suggestion : We did try out Maxwell Road Hawker Centre (which is just 5 min away from this place), Old Airport Road Hawker centre. Chinatown complex gives impression that it has many choices and its most conveniently located. Each of these hawker centres have some star food outlets which you can identify based on the number of people waiting in queue. Chinatown complex may not feature on the top 3 of hawker centres but if you are going to Chinatown for shopping or just for a walk, this is a convenient place. Do NOT miss Soy Chicken. Hawker centres are fairly clean but be mentally prepared that you may be sharing table with others and the cutlery, plates etc are reused and they are not of restaurant quality. But after all this itself is an experience you should try, if you are a foodie, and don't forget this is best place for people on shoestring budgets as food is cheap for Singapore standards. We spent S$10 per head for hearty meal including juices.I have rated it 3 as other food we ordered was nowhere close to the Soy Chicken. Also it was less vibrant compared to other hawker centres
5
For SGN$20 you can feast on beautiful pork, noodles and soup and 2 fresh fruit juices. Pick the busy stalls - some have 30 minute waits between 1100 and 1400 - ignore those with no queues....The range of food here is wonderful. Don't be pit off by the surroundings. Then you can go shopping in the wet food market i the basement with its wonderful selection of fresh fish, meat, dry goods and fruit and veg
5
If you love markets, this is a great place to come too. Early in the morning, it is very lively in the basement where the market is. All the people come earlier in the morning to buy all their groceries for their meals for the rest of the day. There is the wet market with all the various sea foods. Many are cut up, packaged and ready to cook. All sorts of meat, fruits and vegetables. We get our fill of exotic fruits here to take back to the hotel to eat for the days we will be in Singapore. Upstairs is the food court (hawker style). Quite typical fare and we always have something to eat once we decide what we want to eat (so much variety). Then you can stroll along afterwards throughout the Chinatown area. If we return to Singapore this will be on our list
3
There are some great hawker food stalls in Singapore - just we could not find one in Chinatown Complex. Most of the stalls are graded C with some B rated - we had a seafood laksa from one that had uncooked muscles in it. Not very nice and not how it's meant to be prepared
4
Originally, we planned to go to the Maxwell FC. Our driver suggested us to go Chinatown. We were there on a Monday early evening. It was not busy. We tried few stores there. They were all good. Price are very reasonable. You should be adventurous and try as much as you can for the taste of Singapore there. This is a place the locals eat instead of tourist
5
A visit to the Chinatown food court is a must do for anyone who comes to Singapore. As we always stay in Chinatown purely because of the great food, we will usually visit here a few times. Be adventurous - just buy a few small plates and try whatever takes your fancy - most of the time it'll be pretty good. Great atmosphere and food at ridiculously good prices. Just go.
4
One of my favorite hawker centre. Food variety is good with stalls that serve quality food. Price is very reasonable. Can be crowded during weekends. There are some food that you seldom find in Singapore.
5
So pleased to see how we'll maintained the area is. Buildings retain their heritage value and shop fronts reflect the enduring trades and tradition.
5
hainanese Chicken rice, claypot rice, wanton noodles, char kway teow, satays, fresh fruit juices...OMG! your choice is endless, and dirt cheap and fast, can be hot like the whole island but so worth it, bring tissues!!
5
Locals eat here which says it all. Fab food cooked fresh. Very cheap- 2 dishes cost £5 plus included a won ton soup free as a starter. Go there and eat authentic food.
5
This is one of my favorite food centre in Singapore. The number of choices are unaccountable. It has included many famous stalls and you can find all local dishes here. My favorite includes fishball noodle, char Kway Teow, BBQ chicken wings and Malay style seafood such as gong gong and cockles. However, don't go too late during weekdays because they do close early for most of the stalls
5
Some great food stands here. Tried the claypot stand and this is something a bit different. We went with local friends so they showed us how to mix in the sauce and get the rice and the cooked ingredients mixed. Very yum. Carrot cake dish is not what you may think and is also very delicious as is the oyster egg dish. Great value
5
If this is the place, it's a building that is basically just eateries and hawker stalls. On the second floor, I think, there is one particular place that only sells Chicken Laksa. You will know this is the one because there is a constant queue of people wanting this heavenly soup. And the soup didn't disappoint. You can have a kiddies size (SGD$4), a medium adult size ($5) or a hungry hungry hippo size ($6).If you happen to come at lunchtime then expect to wait, but the wait is well worth it. Just make sure you have some packs of tissues with you to reserve you table, but also to wipe the drool off your mouth while you wait in line and watch others devour their Laksa
5
This foodcourt is part of the Chinese Market and a very interesting place. We had delicious freshly made Dim Sum at "Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao", food stall No., 02-135 (B-rated), which i like better than the Dim Sum at Din Tai Fung (and about 3 to 4 times less expensive -check out the Dim Sum in Sezchuan broth)
5
Once again, I am not disappointed by the Roast Pork!! After being away for so long, I still find . this place the best. The chicken is soft and tender. I normally do not take breast meat of the chicken, but, this stall....My out of town friends, too, said it was good. We had a whole chicken, and it was only S$14. The down side is the very long wait. I queued for 45 minutes and this was almost at 2pm. At the end, even my friends said, it was well worth the wait

4 mins agoClick : http://www.dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/05/ann-chin-popiah-chinatown-complex-market.html for full review and picsAfter my failed attempt to have Ann Chin Popiah at Singapore Food Trail @Singapore Flyer, I headed to Chinatown Hawker Centre where the actual store is located as it sells my two favourite hawker food popiah and kueh pie tee! I thought I was lucky as the hawker centre had just been opened for a few days since it shut down for refurbishment.We ordered two popiah (one for $1.60/two for $3) one spicy and one plain. Overall, they were one of the better popiahs in Singapore, and as always, I prefer spicy to plain. The resilient skin did not wilt when it contacted the moist filling. There is also the crunchy fritters and peanuts, but the mangkwang (turnip) was not very flavorful.In fact, I like the kueh pie tee ($3 for 6 pieces) with the crispy prawns sitted on top. The shells have been arranged in the container and are filled upon order. Try putting the entire thing in your mouth (if it is big enough:p) and let the flavors explode in your mouth. The fillings were warm, juicy and crunchy. Instead of popiah, the kueh pie tee would be something that I would want to have again. But, I just realised I missed out the Satay Bee Hoon on the right. Need to go back soon to have my fix
4
A great place to poke around, especially the wet market. Have a look for Anthony's Spices in one corner where you can buy some excellent BBQ rubs and curry mixes.
2
I don't really get this venue. It is not polished like the rest of Singapore but it doesn't seem really authentic either. The smell of raw meat is pervasive though... Maxwell Food Court or Lah Pah Sat would be better options for most visitors.
4
Interseting information around Chinatown reveal its past history.The Chinatown centre provides useful maps.
4
This is a very huge hawker centre with soo many stalls to choose from. I have tried different stalls and most of them are good. One needs to queue at the really famous ones. But the building is a run down so I would usually buy back and eat at our office
4
If you can spend half a day here, good mix of shops, and stalls where you can haggle the price down. Whilst people want to sell you something you do not feel pressurised and can just say your window shopping. Lots of history here and well worth the visit 
3
Food court and hawker style dining is a very popular way to have a meal throughout Singapore. In Chinatown, you can try the Chinatown Complex, which is behind the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Museum if interested in trying some budget friendly, local cuisine. While there is some Thai, bit of Indian and other SE Asian food on offer, what is mostly served up here is Chinese inspired dishes. Having just eaten, we only availed of a cup of coffee at the Super Mummy Stall, taking our Kopi C (sweet milky coffee) for SG$1.10 per cup. This was a good a coffee as we found anywhere and much cheaper than in the nearby restaurants. We have always enjoyed the food court scene in Singapore and include the Chinatown Complex as one of many good options worth trying. Another nearby place worth trying is the the Maxwell Food Center, which is just across the South Bridge Road from here. Both are good options if you are interested in this local style of dining while spending time in Chinatown
4
China town was an awseome cultural experiance, so much to do and see. Loved how they were giving out free samples of food because it all looks so weird. i had tried most of it before but my boyfriend wouldnt even look at buying the food but with taste test it make you try and you end up liking it.Great food as always. We went wanting to have lunch and not much was open until 2pm wich was a pain cause we missed out on the market stalls. Resturants were still nice but a little bit more pricey.It being my 1st time to CHINA TOWN i would deffinatly go again but later in the day or night time
4
This stall is on Level 2. Unfortunately, I don't have the stall number but if you're there during peak meal times, that is 12:00-1:00pm and 6:00-7:30pm, just look for the long queue!They are one of the few stalls in Singapore still selling chicken rice for S$2 a plate. Their chicken noodles are S$2.50 per plate. I would rate their soya sauce chicken as on par with their more expensive competition in Upper Cross Street, just a stone's throw away.I had a plate of chicken rice $2, additional roasted pork (crispy and delicious!) $1 and a plate of bean sprouts $2. I was given a small bowl of soup (a bit bland but helps to wash down the meal :-).I'd say it's very good value for money. During my queuing, I saw a Japanese couple studying the stall's food and prices and I encouraged them to try (with the help of some sign language..) and I noticed that they did. When I finished my lunch, I saw them near the front of the line. I'm sure they enjoyed the food.Oh, I got a tip from a regular in the queue: if you're queuing in the evening check the chicken hanging in the glass case. Better still, ask the stall operators if they have enough chicken for everyone. The regular guy experienced queuing for more than 45 mins but the chicken had run out when it got to his turn.For groups, you can order a whole chicken for $14 an
5
Went to lunch at the Chinatown Complex today - there would be nearly 100 stalls in this building.We had dumplings and seafood laksa washed down with a barley drink. There were so many options available that I became overwhelmed with choices. If you like the first you see buy it. Come back another day for your next choice.On the ground floor there are clothing and general merchandise stalls - don't forget to bargain - you may get a suprise.This is Singapore as the locals enjoy it...don't miss it - take your taste buds on a journey

The Chinatown Food Centre is located on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex.Personally it ranks as one of my top places for hawker food (street food) in Singapore.Its not a pretentious place, its is not deliberately engineered to give tourists a "hawker centre" experience like some places in Singapore.The Food Centre offers a wide range of great local fare at low prices. The crowd speaks for itself.Be open minded and adventurous, dont let the dirt and smell put you off...its part of an authentic experience.If you cant decide what to get.....look at the queue.Not eveyone speaks English but dont be too worried.If you think you cant communicate with the stall operators....use you fingers to point at the signs on stall

Loved the cheap beer and the mix of all kinds of dishes (Malay, Chinese and Indian). Just note though that you will find better dishes vs the ones you sample here, but you need to explore Singapore and find the specialty restaurants,

As usual Chinatown was full of great shopping bargains from clothes to electronics, jewelry, shoes, material etc. The best part was the food court in the basement that gives a picture of the Chinese art of eating!

This place you can get may food with cheep price, you only need go to upstair and all the food already there

We ate here a few times as it was near our hostel. It was definitely the most authentic foodcourt we ate in whilst in Singapore. There was just so much variety and the prices are so low. The food is up and down but that's to be expected. I had some excellent meals here, and some not as excellent meals. Everything was far from horrible though. If you're serious about having a true Singapore food experience, make sure you visit

It looks dirty and smells nasty but its full of excellent culinary surprises. the locals eat here at a fraction of the price of the tourist food stalls and its so very much better. Suspend your prejudices and concepts and trial new foods and you won't be sorry. Despite appearances its clean and you won't get ill anymore than you would at the chinatown hawker stands

We have visited the food centre numerous times and have not completed eating our way around all the popular stalls. So far I have been bowled over by the popiah, seow long pau, tim sum, and beef kway teow noodles. Cheap, excellent flavour, but I wish I had two stomachs

Upstairs food court has lots of the same dishes you'll find down on the Food Street below at a fraction of the price in a food court atmosphere. Got Laksa and pork and noodles for S $6, which is less than we paid for one dish outside. Go here for dinner

This complex provided a hawker center on the top floor, shopping on the main floor and a meat/fruit/vegetable store in the basement. The restaurants in the area are good for a special night out. To have a more local experience at reasonable prices, the hawkder centers are the way to go. The amount of variety was almost numbing but you can quickly see which places are the most popular. We often ate a full meal for 2 for less than $10

We visited the Chinatown Complex recently, and entered from New Bridge Road into what was quite a dark building with lots of stalls selling mostly clothing. We eventually worked our way towards the rear which opened up to the magnificent vista of the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. From there we navigated to Smith Street, ending up at a corner restaurant (opposite the Chinatown Heritage Centre) on Pagoda Street, where we had a decent meal. My overall impression was of how clean and organised the shops and streets were. But for me, I much preferred the vastly more atmospheric and bustling Jalan Petaling in KL

I really enjoyed the trip, it's just that the food has always been a problem, I am very hard to try new foods so I became difficult to adapt. as well as our vacation to Singapore, lucky we chose the hotel in Chinatown area, all kinds of foods I normally eat. so a week was quickly passedDelicious food, large portions, reasonable prices, clean place.for the smokers, Chinatown little more easy to find a place to smoke than other places in Singapor
