Well preserved in the heart of the CBD! Serves one of the best Chinese food of Hokkien cuisine! Old school dinning and good food!

We searched for an authentic Hokkien restaurant that was central and found this place. Food was good and service was 5⭐️.
It was a great Mother's Day lunch!

We celebrated Mother Day lunch here. It allowed to replace the dish, we replaced with the Crab meat egg omelette with lettuce wrap. Grandpa and parents liked it.

Visited this restaurant for dinner recently. It was located in the CBD but locating its actual location in the building can be tricky. It is located on the fifth floor but patrons need to use a separate elevator to reach it.Food is quite good in this restaurant that looks and feels different from most Chinese restaurants nowadays. Service is ok and price is reasonable. The roast chicken is good and juicy. Would highly recommend this restaurant for those who is looking for a reasonably priced restaurant with the retro feel. And with stiff competition, restaurants like Beng Thin may find it harder and harder to survive in Singapore's extremely tough f&b scene

Decided to celebrate my mum's birthday here and made a reservation around 2 weeks ago. There was 2 timeslots for dinner - 6pm or 8pm. A couple of days before the dinner, the restaurant called to remind me of the reservation and wanted to know if there were any dishes to pre-order (example roast suckling pig which needs 1 day to pre-order, or fish dishes). We arrived at 6pm and the place was pretty empty for a Saturday evening. It became more crowded around 6.30pm and the clientele are mainly families with elderly customers. We (5 adults, 1 kid and 1 toddler) ordered:-  1. ngoh hiang and her zou - I prefer the prawn roll than to the liver roll.2. crispy chicken - mediocre 3. kong bak pao - amazing! the sliced braised pork belly really melts in your mouth!4. asparagus with prawns - prawns were huge 5. hokkien noodles - savory though a little too starchyThe waitress taking our order seems unimpressed that we ordered so few dishes and was pushing us to order the braised duck with yam, braised chicken with yam and steamed fishes. I declined and was right as we could not finish most of the dishes, especially the hokkien mee.Wanted to order desserts but they do not sell individual portions. Not sure of the total cost as my brother in law paid for it. Think there is some credit card discount for OCBC credit card

Went on a Saturday night and had dinner set for 8 paxService was fast and very good.Waitress, middle aged to elderly was very attentive, friendly and polite, changed plates without being asked.Food came quite fast after ordering.Duck salad was good, crab amount was generous in soupRoast chicken and Hokkien Mee was good as in traditional Hokkien restaurant.Ample car park space even on a Saturday night

Recommended by a friend for traditional hokkien food. It's a Sunday lunch hour, surprisingly it's not crowded - as friend had warned to make reservations first. Dishes ordered: Fish maw soup - very flavoury and good portion. Ngoh hiang mix-plate - nice and authentic. Hokkien mee (black sauced version) - disappointed, no better than any coffeeshop zichar. Or Nee (yam paste) is good.Overall the food is slightly salty than I prefer, relatively quite pricey... the service is excellent
2
This restaurant has been around for quite some time.Ambience is getting older.Service depends on which day you are here.Food is below average and no innovation or change after so many years. None of their dishes is so good that I have to recommend.Prices are affordable

I had dined at Beng Thin Hoon Kee Restaurant last evening with my family and it was a great dining experience! The food is great and more importantly, the customer service is exemplary. The serving staff are helpful, going to a great extent to ensure a smooth and enjoyable dining exprience, despite the fact that the restaurnt is full. Used plates are replaced with clean ones efficiently, tea pots are replenished once they are depleted and request for extra sauce is always met with a welcoming gesture. I strongly recommend anyone who love Hokkien food and traditional cuisine to dine at this restaurant

If you are looking for a chinese restaurant that isn't the usual franchise types, this is the place. It is a casual chinese dining place, that's great for dinner. Food is tasty and reasonably priced. Reservations are needed as that place was packed. We had the duck melon salad which was refreshing, and also the chilli sauce crayfish. Crayfish was great as it was really huge portions and meaty, well worth the price - very flavourful. Their yam paste dessert (with pumpkin) was a favourite all around the table. Service was average. They served the dishes very fast and we wished they brought it out slower! Our table ran out of space really quickly. Overall great experience. Would come back again with my family.
5
I love going here whenever I have friends visiting, dinner with colleague, or eating with a larger group of people. Everyone loves the food there and it is not oily like many chinese restaurants. Love it!

This is a traditional Singapore Hokkien or Minnan restaurant located on the 5th floor of the OCBC Bank car park building. Prices are reasonable by Singapore standards.The services are efficient and friendly. Popular dishes are oyster omlette, roast suckling pig, fish maw soup, Hokkien mee, ngor hiang et

My girlfriend and I decided on Beng Tin for a celebration as both of us are Hokkien. Although I thought 5 courses were too much for lunch, I agreed on the set menu as it had two dishes we like. The duck salad was below par, with no sign of the duck and the melon was tasteless. This was followed by a delicious crab meat and sharkskin soup. Ngo hiang followered but it was dry and over fried. We were quite full by then and gave the Hokkien noodles a miss, although we did enjoy the black jelly dessert.The waiting staff were quite senior and did not seem able to process customer's requests. We wanted each course to be served separately and leisurely so that the dishes would not get cold. Despite two requests, the ngo hiang came while we were still eating the sharkskin soup. We had no choice but to send it back to the kitchen. Apart from this, the waitresses were quite pleasant
3
This is a restaurant that only those more senior in age will appreciate and will frequent. In fact, at my visit, the restaurant was almost half filled and each table had at least one dinner who are senior in age. My siblings congregated in this visit in memory of our parents and also all of us are not exactly young.We ordered several dishes - fried oyster omelette, prawn rolls, sliced fish, yam and scallion, pork ribs, mee sua and orh nee dessert.Only the oyster omelette and sliced fish was truly nice. The omeltte is unique - it is a paper thin and crispy sheets with the oysters layered on top. The yam based dishes were nice but the yam taste seemed diluted. The pork ribs was more bones than the meat. The mee sua was bland.Service here is good though. Staff here were prompt and catered to all our requests. Not fantastic food but my siblings should still be coming back here, at least once a year

Old name restaurant, old style of works, super inefficient and poor customer service. You should have been out of business with this kind of condecending attitude that treats customers like scum. We are paying customers and don't owe you guys a living. Please take your restaurant somewhere else

Had CNY lunch with a team of colleagues this week. Food was great for most items in the CNY set lunch. However hygiene was compromised with hair found in my bowl of hokkien noodles. I returned to the serving waitress whom apologized. Fair enough and I did not make a fuss nor ask for a new bowl.The serving waitresses were all nice and attentive. Main service issue is from the ladies manning the cashier counter (they look like senior staff, some not in uniform).When we made the booking fee 2 weeks back to secure the tables, we were told initially AMEX card cannot be used. This is perplexing given the establishment of the restaurant . It was only after we questioned that they relented and reluctantly accepted with one of the lady commenting - it is "not good" for us. Seriously!?!The second time we had a bad experience at the cashier was when doing payment after having CNY lunch. When we requested to split into 2 bills as we had 2 tables, it should not a customer's problem when your cashier machine or cashier is slow in processing such requests. That same lady again commented next time please inform in advance, if not we caused the queue for payment to jammed up. Seriously!?! No more next time

This is a very low profile traditional Hokkien restaurant situated on the 5th floor car park of OCBC building. Can tell it’s a very popular restaurant as it’s very crowded even it’s a weekday, and need to put a deposit for the reservation! We ordered a Chinese New Year set for 12 people. The food presentation were very good and traditional but the food taste were average as it did not give me a ‘wow’ feel! We were generally quite disappointed with the steam fresh garoupa and many other dishes as they were not hot enough when served, and that fish served just did not have that ’fishie’ taste we expected. Special mention on Hokkien fried noodle as they did it very well with great taste. Staff were very polite but they hardly smile! The service is good but it’s a bit too fast that we needed to tell them to slow down. It was a full house while we were there, very noisy until we also made a loud ‘CNY yum sheng’ to let known our existence! Overall it’s an expensive restaurant but a good traditional hangout for Hokkien food lover
5
During my holidays in Singapore I have been invited to this different Chinese restaurant. It is one of the few restaurants that offer Fujian/Hokkien cuisine and is known usually by Chinese people. The food was delicious with different spicy taste and the service very good. I recommend this restaurant for those who like to try a delicious and different Chinese cuisine

We have ordered a set lunch for 4 pax. We wanted to top up 3 additional bowl of rice but never came and we forgotten about it. When the bill came, there was a charge for 3 bowl of rice. I kindly asked for the reversal and explained that the rice didnt come.However, this waitress and the group of staff were discussing about this issue. The revised receipt came and indicated 2 bowls of rice! I asked again, why there was a charge when i say the rice didnt come! The waitress told me that 2 bowl of rice came, and verified with the waiter!So they are telling me either the waiter ate up the 2 bowls of rice or I am trying to cheat them! The waitress went back and discuss this with a group of staff again behind the counter, kept looking back at our table.The next bill came with the correct details.I urged all diners to check their bills carefully when you are in this Restaurant. Their expression clearly claims that we are here to cheat the 3 bowl of rice which cost $3! Seriously, never doubt your customers. sadly there is no CCTV in the area to check on this. It may seem like a small matter but this is doubting your customer's integrity! Sorry you lost one of your many customers! Never to visit here again

Beng Thin Hoon Kee is a place you might remember, if you have visited it enough times to enjoy the communal vibe of friends and/or family while sharing various dishes. It has undergone renovations, ever since it moved to these premises in 1979. The entrance is as memorable as ever (see photos), and the lanterns were beautiful to gaze upon during the night. The lady boss who used to be here up until 9 years ago has retired, but the female staff who have taken over (especially the one in her former position) appear to be doing commendably to continue her standards of service. That said, this review of their service is based on the current experience less than a week ago for a birthday celebration, so this review does not extend to consistency of service for other diners. 2 dishes were pre-ordered 2 days beforehand ie the lotus chicken, and the pomfret. My advice after placing orders for the rest of the dishes at the restaurant is to ask for the braised sea cucumber in mustard greens to be served first, and then ask for the duck salad (which is usually served first). There are no pictures of the sea cucumber dish (which is not a dish most people can do at home unless you know how to remove the bitterness of the vegetable in this dish, as this restaurant does). The sea cucumber used was of very good quality, and the dish was so good that we finished it before I remembered to take pictures of the dish. The duck salad has undergone a slight change ie the honey plum sauce is less sweet, and mango has been added. The health-conscious will appreciate the sizeable portions of fruits and cucumber, which help to make this salad memorable. I would have preferred a little more sauce for this dish, but it is lovely nevertheless.The pomfret was fresh and cannot be criticised. If a different type of tofu was used ie softer and silkier, the tofu would be nicer, but it would risk dissolving during the cooking process.Leng zi kuei is a dish children will especially adore, and not just the adults. Stuffing of lotus seeds, bamboo, mushrooms, etc- In an oh-so-tender spring chicken, cooked to a textural goodness which is firm enough when portioned, but easily melts in the mouth. It seems to be slightly saltier than I remember, but can be remedied if one asks for less salt when pre-ordering.The claypot tofu with mixed seafood is decent. The tofu was the star, the seafood less so. Perhaps the claypot tofu with mixed mushrooms might have been a better choice. The snow peas in this dish and the previous dish is crunchy and sweet, and the sauce compliments the dish very well. One memorable factor about the various dishes for this dinner: The gravy or sauce for each dish is distinct and compliments the ingredients used, but may be too subtle for those who only prefer stronger-tasting foods. There was only a bit of stomach space left for the hokkien noodles. The Hokkien noodles were springy and delightfully-prepared in the cooking process (probably by new chefs, because the older chefs would have retired and my previous memories of soggy hokkien noodles meant I did not like this dish in previous experiences), and a welcome end to a meal without dessert. For the generous portion sizes and this quality, the bill is surprising, when you consider what it costs to dine at a Chinese restaurant these days. The female staff were accommodating and helpful and politely soft-spoken, but the lone male waiter (his nametag says Ken) is surly and abrupt enough to ruin anybody's dining experience, if there is prolonged continuous contact. Our experience was quite limited with him because of the female staffers, which I appreciate. This place is not flashy or glitzy or gaudy, and it is understated comfort in an upmarket setting without being pretentious. If you want to impress parents who value certain aspects of chinese tradition and they are not vegetarians, this is a good place to demonstrate an understanding of value-for-money and quality and tradition, especially if you pick the right dishes. That said, they need to use a better quality of pu-erh tea leaves. We left feeling full and happy, and not full in a bad way. It was a dinner I daydreamed about, the next day. The deceased Mr Lim Yew Hoon (who started Beng Thin Hoon Kee in 1949) can rest assured that what he founded will enable the newer generations to enjoy such cuisine from the Fujian province. That said, I wish there were more vegetarian dishes, in order to be more inclusive. It would be interesting to see how Beng Thin Hoon Kee can incorporate more vegetables and vegetarian dishes, and I hope the restaurant will do so at some point

been informed that the places been over 45 years already and keep the same concept
in general food are good spend sin 200 for 4 person exclude alcohol
but still value of money
very local traditional set up

This restaurant was unexpectedly visited, but we were surprised at the wonderful service we experienced there. The food quality was beautiful, the ambience was awesome and the hospitality of the staff was amazing !
5
Food is excellent and value for money. The portion is generous unlike other chinese restaurants. Tends to be crowded on weekends so highly recommend to make a prior reservation. Staffs are polite and service is good, given the number of occupied tables in the restaurant each time. Excellent!

Lunch with an old friend. She wanted me to try the Hokkien favourites. We had fish maw soup, five spice rolls, oyster omelette and hokkien noodles. all very good. the only issue I had with this place is they rushed us out for their 3 pm close
4
This is an excellent Hokkien restaurant with a lot of great dishes. My favorite dishes include duck salad with mango, fried oysters with egg, hokkien mee. Reasonably priced as well although they only served set dinner menus on special occasions like Father's Day when I brought my family here. Great value for money on normal days
1
Suggested to came here for family celebration as I frequent here with my colleagues during lunch on wkdays. Was disappointed and pissed off from the moment I call in to reserve two tables. The receptionist was rude and prior to the booking pressured me to make my order two days before. On the day of the booking, fish maw soup that I ordered tasted like plastic, was offered desert as compensation but was offered only one table which make me feel insulted. The boss and manager never said they are wrong and keep saying that parts of fish maw may be fishy. Not coming back here again

Discovered this gem a while back and have been going back ever since. Old school but great service, flexible and affordable. Well preserved look and feel. The dishes are very traditional and yummy.. Must order the crispy chicken, eggs with cabbage, orh nie, cod fish, ngoh hiang.. The set for 2 is good for 3 pax and u can change the dishes u don't like.. Perfect service and great place! Unlike all the chain restaurants!!

Had a lovely weekday lunch with a couple of girlfriends here. We chose this restaurant for nostalgia having eaten here on a number of occasions in the early noughties. Very little has changed with the decor resembling a 1980s Chinese restaurant. Its still amusing to make your way here through the OCBC building car park. The food was good too:Teochew duck saladOyster omeletteCrab and egg served with lettuce pocketsTeochew fried noodles Everything was tasty!
4
Went to this restaurant with my in-laws after more than ten years, found the food still the same typical hokkien style. The hokkien mee, oyster egg, duck with sea cucumber, fish soup with yam, prawn roll still good only the kong bak for the pau was a little sweet and the herbal chicken was too soupy. Service was also attentive and good
2
I went there on Friday for a business lunch with 2 guests. I rate the food as 2 out of 10 - not poison but not much better than a neighborhood zi-char. Far below expectations. We had crab meat soup and stir fried noodles among other dishes. I had to douse my food with lots of chili and garlic sauce to make it edible. I wouldn't go back if I had a choice
3
Authentic Hokkien food.
As Hokkien food tends to be on the rough side as compared to Cantonese and Teochew food, I could only give them an average score in terms of taste and presentation.
Service is also average.
2
Went with a group of 5 friends for lunch. Have not gone there for last 6 months. We ordered a la Carte. Had the fish maw soup, noodles, oyster omelette, duck and vegetables, everything was so bland, especially the fish maw soup which was full of starch. Think they might have change chef. Disappointed and will not go again unless no choice
5
Place is tucked away but worth a visit as it serves delicious Hokkien cuisine. Highly recommend for a group of 8 to 10 so that you may try several dishes. We had Duck Salad; Crabmeat Fishmaw soup; Broccoli with Scallop; Fried Oyster; Crispy Fried Chicken; Steamed Pomfret Fish; Fried Mee Suah; Yam paste (oar nee) dessert.Every dish was tasty and delicious. The standout dishes for us were the Duck Salad, Fried Oyster and Steamed Pomfret. But don't let the simple looking Broccoli dish fool you. Even that was tasty. Ambience was of typical chinese restaurant. As they are quite popular, there was the usual chinese restaurant noise level but not unpleasant. Also the air conditioning was adequate. No whiffs from the kitchen (at least from where we sat). The service was very prompt. The food was served rather quickly. If you would prefer your dishes served paced out, do make a request when placing the order. Went for Sunday lunch. Parking was ample ($3 per entry). Everyone enjoyed the food and experience. All in our bill came to about $30+ per person. Good value. Hence highly recommended

Was staying at a nearby hotel and since i had a visitor to the Far East with me i asked the hotel staff where they would recommend for good local food (actually, in Singapore, that's too general a question since there are so many types of cuisine available). When i specified Hokkien or Nonya food, they recommended this restaurant. There were only two of us so the range of choice is limited, sadly. It's located at the top level of the car park in the OCBC building and is to be found at the end of the car park -not so easy to find if you don't know the place or if you don't have help. The restaurant is air conditioned and pleasantly decorated. The staff are also pleasant and the waitress made good recommendations - the food is nice and the Duck salad and the Ngoh Hiang (it's similar to Lor Bak but somewhat larger around) recommended were very good. It's authentic local food and worth the eating. Nic

This restuarant has been around since I was born and it's truly a place of family warmth and memories. It has a very deep connection with my family and I simply love their authentic Hokkien food. Now that I'm attached with Bryan, I decided to bring him there to have a meal the night before he leaves because I want to introduce him to my world and also I'd like him to be part of the memories I have with this restuarant. Bryan is a French and even he was awed by the food served especially the Hokkien Mee and Kong Bak Bao! It was a pity we missed the Roasted Chicken but I'm sure I'll bring him there for a meal when he's back in Singapore. Thank you for the wonderful food and thank you for the wonderful memories

One of the oldest Hokkien eateries, this restaurant continues to serve traditional dishes that are consistently good and at reasonable prices through the years. Location wise, this is awkwardly housed near a rooftop carpark in one part of the OCBC office building. This is not a problem with their regulars though, who pack the place over the weekends in the otherwise deserted CBD area.This is a good place to bring overseas guests to sample some authentic Hokkien cuisine over a business meal. The main dining area can noisy when busy so do reserve ahead and ask for a room or corner table

Ate here with family for Wed dinner 20 May 2015. Have eaten here about 3-4 times in past. Always passable food if u order the right dishes. This time I advance ordered a suckling pig (SGD$200), which is abt av price in any Singapore middle-tier restn. I like their suckling pig becos they always give a true suckling pig, not the overgrown giants usually served in other restns. Beng Thin also cuts the slices with some meat on them, not just fat n skin. It was crispy, tasty and not oily. All the experienced foodies in my family really liked it.The other standard dishes I ordered: Oyster Egg(Orh Jian $28), which was crispy with big fresh oysters, and claypot sea cucumber with pig tendon and mustard plant($58), which was very tasty but light on the gravy, and thus above expectations.We also ate the standard Fujian fried noodles which some like a lot, but some don't(flat yellow noodles, very tasty but with a heavy gravy) and had some very soft roast chicken n stir fried Kailan, which was very fresh.In terms of cost, I would call it a value meal, becos take away the suckling pig, it was abt SGD$30+ a person for many dishes.1)Duck salad--Starter, fresh n cold but a bit too sweet for some. I always like this.2)Fish Maw and crabmeat soup--OK but nothing special3)Roasted Suckling Pig--very good4)Sea Cucumber w pig tendon n mustard green--very good5)Oyster Egg--very good6)Roasted Chicken--no probs7)Fujian Fried noodle--I always like this, but not for some.Total cost SGD$440

Had lunch today with family. As usual, always only go for their traditional hokkien food: hokkien fried noodle, fried popiah and prawn roll, oyster omelet, and fish head yam soup. The fried hokkien noodle was not as good as before. Surprised that they have modified the recipe by adding in bean sprout (tau gal). I think this is a bad idea. They had a successful traditional hokkien noodle and they should stick to the proven formula and not try to "fusion" it with other ingredients
5
This is the 2nd time I've been here. First of all, love the location, it's actually at a car park! No worries about finding a place to park. Traditional Hokkien food : yam basket, kong Bah Bao ( not gonna tell you what tis is if you don't know, just order ) , fish maw soup , hokkien noodles( the black version ) , oyster omelette , And of course.. Yam paste for dessert. All of these at unbelievable prices. It will probably cost you an arm or leg somewhere else
3
Celebrated by dad's birthday there last week. This is a "old name" restaurant for hokkien dishes. Decided on this place because its convenient to find parking right outside the restaurant and and friendly for the old folks to walk and move about during this wet December season. The service staff was friendly and there was a waiter (his name was Victor) who interacted with us as he helped to serve and clear our dishes - really friendly. We pre-order the food a day in advance and our experience with the captain was that she was more interested to close the sale and get a down payment of S$200 as deposit.Frankly, I would prefer to go to Beng Hiang at Amoy Street any time for Hokkien food as they are better. Its just that parking at Amoy Street is a really a problem during dinner time at weekends. So what I do is to drop my parents off in front and then search for parking after that. Still, Beng Hiang will be my choice over Beng Thin anytime

I plead complete ignorance on the subject of Fukienese cuisine, knowing slightly more about Chiuchow and Cantonese food and having a pretty good idea what to expect. Anyway, we were all here for part 37 of my wife's nephew's wedding celebrations as guests of my brother-in-law.Well, it all turned out to be rather good especially the large angel fish or "Tong Yu" and the noodles. Everything else was fine, at least there was nothing I positively disliked. Service was pretty efficient, despite it being a Friday evening with all tables being occupied. BTW, why do Chinese restaurants in Singapore rarely provide "Gong Fai" (chop sticks for serving, not for individual use) ? I'm puzzled.Overall - high marks for this place. The only challenge is how to get here if you are not a local and haven't visited previously. It is on the fifth floor of an office building at the far end of a car park once you get out of the lift
4
Was visiting my sis in SG and she recommend dinner here.Took a cab from FourSeason Hotel. Told cab driver OCBC building. He is not sure if there is a restaurant there. Arrived at OCBC building and cab drop us at the bank's main entrance. Luckily my sis met us there, otherwise it will be a challenge to find the restaurant! It's located a 5th floor inside the car park!Our dishes include the 'must haves', oyster omelette, fish maw soup, duck with sea cucumber, pig trotter noodle and yam paste dessert. Food wise is good. Service is good. Overall, it's an enjoyable dinner. As I am not paying, not sure about the price.Reservation s a must as the place is popular.After dinner, walk across the street to boat quay and Clarke quay for the rest of the nights!

went back to beng thin for dinner. we only 3pax, so just ordered their signature dishes = oyster egg, crabmeat fishmaw soup & sea cucumber duck. was last here for a 10pax dinner on 23.12.2013, was pretty ok too, satisfying.#1 the crabmeat fishmaw was a bit low on crabmeat. somehow it was not as tasty as before. #2 the orh jian (蚝煎) – very crispy oyster egg – was every bit as enjoyable (as always!) so much so i decided to try it at home myself. here’s my own oyster omelette. #3 sea cucumber duck was also great. duck meat was soft not sinewy & sea cucumber & soup combination with the duck was quite good. there was a bit of tomatoes & celery. great dish. there was a 15% discount for UOB cards. we paid S$77 nett after discount, quite ok for the 3 substantial dishes for 3pax. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/06/02/simple-nice-dinner-beng-thin-on-1june2014

Good food. But the captain was more keen on her sale than the customers situation. We had 14 of us, including 5 children. Between 7 and 14 years old. We ordered our food which were served Extra Large portions for 14 ADULTS! That was over selling. We ordered 10 dishes and were asked if we wanted more ! At the end we canceled one dish and packed two dishes .Food quality however was good
4
If you are wondering what is "hokkien" food, it is food that is cooked usually by a the "Hokkien" dialect group. Dishes not to be missed here (that are different from elsewhere): oyster omelette, hokkien mee, prawn/meat rolls. Food is reasonably priced for the ambience (noisy at times). Call in advance to make a reservation. Service is so-so (they get quite busy when the whole restaurant is packed!
5
This is a well known restaurant to local Singaporeans - located on the 5th floor of the OCBC building adjacent to the roof top car park - access via lifts or car park.My local friend invited me to experience the Hokkien fare - I particularly enjoyed the Oyster Omelette - it is cooked crispy and very tasty. The Beng Thin Duck Salad was an ideal starter - the wait person mixed up the dish on the table - not a piece was left on the plate - delicious.Also try the Crabmeat Fish Maw soup - add some dark vinegar and pepper to taste.A slightly different restaurant from the normal Singaporean fare
4
This restaurant serves one of the better Hokkien food in Singapore. It is a long established restaurant and is located at the 5th floor of the OCBC carpark building. Very convenient as you can drive right to the doorstep! We found ourselves once again meeting to dine here cos my old classmate was down for a visit and we were all craving for a good Hokkien meal. We had the delicious signature dish of duck salad that reminds me of the CNY loh hei. There is also the signature roast chicken, not forgetting the mouth-watering Hokkien mee! The staff were also very attentive and pleasantly courteous! A very good meal and delightful reunion indeed
4
Finding the restaurant can be a bit tricky because it is accessed via the car park. It's great if you are driving though because you can park on the same floor. We went with family and friends and it came highly recommended. I must say that this is not a bad place at all.For me the Oyster Omelette really stood out as being well executed. It was crispy, the oysters were fresh and succulent, plus it was perfectly seasoned. It is so good I have been thinking about it since. Probably the best Oyster Omelette I've had in a while. Almost everything else we had was made to a very good standard and I have no complaints. However, I don't think they were very good with the braised belly pork and buns. It was too heavy on the aromatic spices throwing its balance off. Also, the friend prawn balls or "ngoh hiang" wasn't very good either. I found them a little too pasty for my liking. Beng Hiang Restaurant on Amoy street is much better at those two dishes.Decor is traditional and decently maintained. Service is also decent - attentive and efficient for a Chinese restaurant. Definitely a place I would go back to, if nothing else, then just for the oyster omelette

Beng Thin Hoon Kee is a long established restaurant; highly regarded in the Singapore community for its Hokkien dishes. Its flagship restaurant is still located at the iconic, IM Pei designed OCBC Building (on the 5th floor). Beng Thin's signature dishes are aplenty. 1) Hokkien Noodles, 2) Oyster Omelette, 3) Yam Basket, 4) Ngoh Hiong combo platein recent years, Beng Thin appear to have caught 2nd wind and business seem to improve at the OCBC outlet both for lunch & dinner for weekdays.weekends, Beng Thin enjoy repeat business from 3-4 generational patronssometime in 2009, Beng Thin decided to take the plunge & open another outlet in the Toa Payoh housing estate. Business is respectable on weekends; but quiet on weekday evenings.last I ate was in May for business dinner at the T. Payoh branch. My clients were impressed enough by the food quality to ask me for the restaurant address.Prices have gone up across the board for white linen topped restaurants across the island state.Beng Thin are staffed with long serving staff augmented by new blood from northern China & also Malaysiagood thing business dinners are tax deductible

This is a restaurant with history. It serve many Hokkien favorites, well known since the older generation. Although it is not a popular place with wonderful ambience or new generation cuisine but u can be sure to get a transitional Hokkien food experience here. The favorites of pork belly buns, salad appetizer and even braised seacucumber with duck are some of their favorites. Have known this place for decades. However it is always a challenges for these owner to keep to their tradition against the competition of time and changes in Singapore
