Absolutely loved the "Roasted Salmon with Cod Fish Caviar" at Itacho Sushi. Their "Tamago Sushi" is on the sweeter side, and among my favourites. Service was average.

Lunch here in airport during layover. Ignored most of the time. Asiàn customers received better service....very noticable. Food was good though. Fair price.
4
Excellent food, great variety at affordable prices..
Fast order on web and good service..
Restaurant offers many weekly special price items with good quality

Convenient location above MRT. Attentive staff. Sushi is excellent. Rest of the food is delicious. Hot green tea is constantly refilled. We’ll definitely be back again.

We were being very indecisive and checked out the menus of about a dozen food places in Orchard Ion before settling on this. It's clearly very popular. We are not sushi experts, so probably could have ordered better, but we each had a 'main' as opposed to a selection plate. My wife had eel, scrambled egg and rice, which she enjoyed. I had teriyaki chicken & rice which I found tasteless and dry. The restaurant gives you a tablet to browse the menu and place your orders, which we found unnecessarily complicated and frustrating. It certainly didn't add to our dining experience, especially since normal waiter service seemed to be on-going. Fair value, but doubt we'd go back
3
Sushi is really good here - too bad that the service isn’t. Waiters didn’t pay any attention what was happening around them. If you don’t mind the bad service, just want to have quickly cheap and good sushi, this is the place where you can head to.
5
When we want cheap, fresh sushi without the frills, we come to Itacho where the standards are consistent no matter which outlet you go to. Fresh sashimi and sushi is what you get here with prompt service without the frills. Today’s highlight was the Hana Butake set - uni, fatty tuna, crab, scallop, salmon roe, tobiko - that was well-presented for it’s price. Under SG$20. As said, cheap eat
5
Good sushi and other japanese food. It is setup in fast food format but the meal was not rushed. The menu offers a good range of jap food at very reasonable prices. Service was super fast. We had our food brought to the table pretty fast and teas refilled on a regular basis
4
Quick stop here on the way home, sat at the counter. Restaurant was pretty full on a Monday night. The menu offers a very usual range of sushi, sashimi, maki, temaki, tonkatsu, tempura dishes etc etc. If you know your way around a Japanese menu you will definitely find plenty here to keep you happy. Service slight haphazard but the food arrived at an okay pace and certainly everyone was friendly enough. In a mall where there are LOTS of restaurants this place is busy so it’s doing it right.

After walking around ION Orchard to check out the Star Wars Force Friday II showcases, we stopped at Itacho Sushi for lunch.Despite a rather long wait to get a table (it was crowded that day, because of Good Friday!) and even to order our meals, the food itself was tasty. And my personal favorites are this Grilled Unagi and a nice Chicken Katsu Rice
5
It is definitely worth going. All items we have tried are good quality - fish was fresh and not from deep freezer. Service was ok-ish but overall worth going.
4
Convenient Location, confortable place with great quality sushi and reasonable prices. Friendly people.
4
Service was polite but a bit laggy. For a short lunch break, it wasn't ideal.That said, food-wise, this place was much better than most run of the mill sushi restaurants around Singapore. The quality of the ingredients was noticeable as the seafood smelt and tasted fresh.Lunch set menus reasonably priced
2
Food was good, and fresh seafood. But they tried to force customers to use their Itacho Singapore App. Where you would have to download it, install, register, set up account, to be able to order your dishes. Its far too much trouble for a simple meal with your date after a long day at work. So we tried to place our order through the staff directly, and was immediately faced with a sacarstic comment and eye rolling that we were not willing to order through the app. Table next to us suffered the same treatment as well.I understand the idea of the app is to promote and give marketing of the business to sign up and get points for discount. But it should be an optional deal, instead of it being shoved down our throats.
3
Came back here for lunch this week and opted for a selection of sushi from the menu. My miso soup turned up quite quickly but the sushi took a long time to arrive. Service seems much slower here than at Plaza Sing or Bugis. Don't think I'll try the Ion outlet again. No complaints about the sushi though: good value for money

Had a disappointing experience today at your Star Vista branch.  Our group of 10 were queueing and were given our seats right about 630pm. Along the way our group of people streamed in and all arrived together at 730pm.  Just when we were about to order our food, we were told that because we had not made any reservations, we need to give up our seats and join the queue again because the group of 10 that made a reservation has arrived.  What puzzles me was when we were led to the table, your service staff did not ask who made the reservations and led us to our table immediately.  And after sitting an hour and on a hungry stomach ready to order, we were shooed out of your restaurant just so that the previous party of 10 that made reservations could have our seats.  Best of all, we were told to join the queue right at the end. As you would be aware, 730pm outside your restaurant there would be a queue definitely. Today, there were at least 15pax in that queue at that time.  The situation was handled badly by your service staff and we were made to leave your restaurant and take our business of eating out somewhere else.  Worst experience ever!!!

This HK chain in the various locations across the city is great value for money. Expect $120-140 for a family of 4 (SGD). We've been dining here for 4-5 years now and when we want unpretentious decent Jap food (the middling conveyor belt chains have food one-star less) we come here for the California rolls, lobster rolls, salmon sashimi, prawn tempura, clams in broth, perky gyozas (yummy green tea salt alert) beef udon and soba. Weekday lunches are an especially good bargain with Katsu-don and Bara Chirashi sets at under $15. An absolute steal considering the quality of the fish and produce and the staggering rental of these units. Now, now, don't expect genteel service and a serene ambience and for the food, got to love
4
popular with many, this chain of restaurants has many outlets across Singapore. one of the popular items would be the salmon sushi which goes for $1.50 a piece, and many have come to order dozens at a go, to satisfy that salmon craving. other noteworthy dishes here are highlighted on the menu but at higher prices. this outlet in ion is one of the more crowded among its chain, and one might have to wait for awhile to be seated. the Starvista outlet appears to be the less, probably due to the high density of F&B outlets in Starvista
5
Service is the best from this outlet. The crowd queue has eased as compared to the old days. Despite the long queue, the service staff especially the lady at the reception counter who took the queue, she handles all requests well and calmly. Recognition shd be given to her! (Forgot to take down her name but she's always there for the past few years). The very good service in addition to the wide variety and bite size portions always brings me and my partner back. Keep up the good service standards. I like it that they serve the customers gladly with their sincerity. Thank you!

I had lunch here with my friend. However food was not worth the price. The service wasn't very nice. I had to wait for 10 minutes for a cup of hot green tea. Its a Japanese restaurants but it doesn't feel like a Japanese restaurant. It looks like one of the Chinese restaurant
2
The quality of this chain restaurant have been dropping.
Fish is no longer and fresh and ok quality. Although their prices are still very low..
Can skip.
1
Decent food, but service horrible. Forgot us, brought wrong thing, slow. Avoid this place. Rolls low on fish, high in rice. Sucks
3
It's an average sushi place. The salmon sashimi was sliced too finely and unevenly. The lady who walked us in could have been less curt and explained how to download the app to order in a more explanatory manner. My daughter ordered the Katsu Don and that was good. Multiple menus making it complicated to order. Set lunches are more reasonable in pricing. Sushis not so. The rest of the staff were very nice.
4
Our family visited this restaurant in the ION Centre in Singapore for a late lunch. This followed an intense morning of shopping !!The food is fresh and authentic. Serving size is very good. There is an excellent range of menu items across the category range. I particularly enjoyed the Tuna Sashimi.The service in this restaurant is awkward. Guests are expected to order menu items through a tablet-based shopping cart. It is tricky to understand and the food categories not always as expected. Drinks need to be ordered separately and through the wait staff.Service was a little slow. Dishes of the same item on our order were delivered separately which made the sharing of dishes tricky.Highly recommended !
1
Food is not as good as before. Plus extremely bad service.Was disappointing when I went for dinner with a friend.Staff were rude and ignored us when we called for assistance.Food was okay, but definitely worse than my previous visits quite some time ago
2
Sushi and sashimi good. Prices are very reasonable given the location. Food serving a little slow. All okay until I got my raw chicken oyaku don. To be fair the manager did not charge me when I showed them but they denied it was raw and said it was marinaid. See pictures for your self and be the judge. Looks nothing like the cooked chicken in their menu
3
Pity they lost performance and turn this place in something impersonal with slow and bad service. They force you to download their app and make self ordering as only alternative?Food arrives in any order like main first, appetizers 20 minutes later, miso with desert... messy!
4
The sushi is good, the service is fair, and the prices are reasonable. This restaurant is in the Ion Orchard mall, and it is across from another sushi restaurant. Both offer good sushi, with this one being the less formal of the two. It is popular, and can have a line waiting to get in at lunch or dinner on weekends and business weekday evenings.My only concern is that the photos do not match what they serve. The photos are beautiful. The actual servings are mediocre. For example, I ordered tempura squid based on the photo in the menu. What I got was lumps of tempura something, probably squid, but not otherwise recognizable. It tasted OK, but my experience with Japanese food is that the appearance is important.Service here is fair. You may have to flag someone down, even when the restaurant is relatively empty. If you don't mind being cramped for space, sit at the sushi bar. You can watch the chefs and you'll get faster service
1
We arrived at 625pm to get a table for party of 5. No service staff at counter and they will just look away when see us. Finally a waitress came to us and telling us that we need to wait for the whole party to be here in order to get a table for 5. We told her that we want to order the food first, and she said she can only allocate a table for 4 for us. We tried to explain to her that our birthday girl is on her way. However, she was still insisted that we have to wait.Well, we have gotten a table for 5 pax at Watami immediately without the need to wait for the arrival of whole party.And we have ordered first drinks and first round of foods. Cheers Watami! Well done.
2
After being seated we were quickly introduced to Itacho Sushi's new ordering process. They no longer let you order from wait staff, rather requiring you to download their app to your iOS or Android phone, scroll through quite a long menu to select your items, then scan a QR code to send the order to the kitchen. While for repeat customers this might work well, as a first-time visitor to Itacho Sushi it's a cumbersome process. We had just landed in Singapore, and between two of us only had 10% battery on our phones. After a few issues downloading the app, we finally logged in to find a lot of items were (incorrectly) showing as 'sold out'. With only 30 mins to eat before an appointment, we asked the wait staff to please take our order themselves. A waitress pulled out her iPhone and was able to quickly take our order and send it to the kitchen. The food arrived and was good, however the customer experience was poor. Perhaps a better solution would be to have an iPad or tablet at each table from which customers can place their order, rather than forcing them to download an app which - especially in a hub like Singapore - might never be used again
4
i went there for a quick dinner during a business trip to Singapore. I had some sake and a selection of Nigiri and Sashimi. The quality of the sushi was excellent! The service was prompt and friendly. will certainly come back.
4
The kasuga set is my all time favourite. Yum! They have different special each visit. Prices are reasonable.
4
We frequent itacho sushi since they open! Good value sushi and japanese food overall. Will keep coming because in this price range, they must be the best Jap you can get!
5
great value sushi, we thoroughly enjoyed. the service was quick and the sushi itself was very good value for money. would visit again and would recommend for someone looking for something more low key for dinner.
3
Nice and confortable location - fresh and tasty food - average service and restaurant - highly reccomanded for Young people
5
We dined at the basement of Bedok mall at Bedok mrt with non stop service of industrious Adrian Lee ensuring you have hot piping ocha despite the Sat's crowd.The 6.30pm treat of 40 n 60cts salmon skin sushi is a great welcome to sushi lovers with a limitation of 1 each of three different varieties....a nice appreciation from the owner of its patron support.My favourite is sweet ebi 6pcs forS$10 ...it really live up to its reputation of sweet and is firm. The next fresh and firm scallops are a delight coupled with the vinegared ginger you are in sashimi heaven ... oiishi.Their cod liver is a must and it is served cold in vinegared thinly sliced salad ..yum.The saba fish is well grilled with lightly salt marinate and to perfection.Salmon sashimi with salmon eggs served with rice and a mixed sashimi of tuna, salmon, ebigo and tomago completed our dinner.The dinner cost was S$78 for 3, a lucky and satisfying night as we got a table quick, good seating and good service and to our surprise the food came early despite the crowd....tq all. With the wondrous craze of catching pokemon on, after our satisfying dinner, my son won a power bank at the designated pokemon lucky draw park with nice cool ice cream to combat our humid equatorial heat
5
It was our first day Singapore, we were shopping at the Ion shopping mall. We wanted to grab lunch and selected this small casual mall restaurant judging from how busy it was. We hit the jackpot! Amazing! You have to taste roasted salmon with cod fish caviar sashimi. It is to die for! If you happen to go Ion mall for shopping, do not eat anywhere else...
5
Expect to wait and queue up to 1 hour if you do not book 1 day in advance but the wait or advance booking is well worth it as this place serves up the best and authentic sushi. The service staff was excellent and so polite and attentive.Their raw sashimi spread was exquisitely excellent
3
We've been walking around a lot (aka sightseeing) and felt like we needed a quick 'recharge' stop. We wanna have a seat while grabbing some light bites so we picked this place (let's face it, we're both die-hard jam food enthusiasts). This is my second time at this outlet. Menu still pretty much the same, food quality still as good and the ocha still as yummy. Service is good, although the waiters could be more friendly. Price is reasonable for the food quality.
4
If you are craving for Japanese sushi, I would highly recommend Itacho@ION. Do take note of Long queue during dinner time or weekend.The food were great and fresh especially the salmon sashimi and the 3 different types of roasted salmon & skin soya sauce. Unfortunately you only can order 1 set per pax for each of the roasted salmon & skin soya sauce. If you spent more than sgd 10 per pax you are entitled 1 free wet tissue and 1 green tea. However we were not provided with any wet tissue. Overall the dining experience was great. Staffs were friendly and attentive. I was given a table with a waiting time of less than 5 minutes. It was Tuesday night eve of public holiday. Will surely pay another visit and highly recommend to everyone
4
...good for grapping some food during shopping. We found prices on the upper end of what we have seen for this type of food. Service is average.
4
I come here with family and friend
We order several kind of sushi, also donburi. Mostly salmon and scallops (seafood) we're all love seafood. A lot of varian and great taste here.
5
First time and was impressed. Busy with lots of people waiting. Service was quick and food came quite fast. Must say it was fresh. Will go again. Dinner for 4 of us, spent around SGD70.
5
I found this restaurant a bit by accident.
But I'm glad I did. The food was excellent. The beer and the glass it was served nicely chilled. The price was very reasonable. A recommendation!
5
I dined in the branch at Star Vista recently. This is one of my Favourite Itacho branches. The sushi is fresh and delicious. Not very expensive too. Would strongly recommend a try if you haven't been there before. You can even order their Sake (Japanese rice wine) for $16 a bottle. Quite a deal!
5
We went to the airport terminal 3 branch, food was fresh and good. Service staff was relatively nice though busy. We had to get our own baby chair after waiting for it for a long while. Though price was slightly higher, the food was worth it.
5
The Itacho Sushi chain is definitely one of the better sushi restaurants that I love to dine in at. The sushi is really delicious and price wise decent. I have eaten in many of the Itacho sushi restaurants in Singapore where PS branch is my favourite. The Orchard and Bugis Branch are ok. All of the Itacho Sushi branches are crowded since opening. Highly Recommended for sushi lovers
3
One more of the get you in, order and get you out places in Singapore. We thought it was funny that their pricing acumen is so sharp that they know they have to charge you $1 for cold water rather than the free room temperature water. I guess they need to cover the cost of the electricity needed to make the ice. Anyway... Food was good, fresh and service was quick. Only thing to note is if the menu says it has mayonnaise on it, you better really, really like mayonnaise. For example the California roll came drenched in it and we had to send it back. Which they accepted and replaced. So, we appreciated that. Decent sushi in ion if you are in a hurry and don't require much attention.
4
It explains why there was such a long queue. Had waited about half an hour before we got seated. So do get there early before peak times so as not to torture yourself out of pent-up hunger.For the meal, we had the Grilled Saury (S$5), Salmon Skin Shoyu with cod ($1.20), Scallop with Lobster salas (S$6), Scallop with Seafood & Cheese ($3), Roasted salmon with cheese and salmon with cod fish($3), Caramel pudding ($3.50)..etc. The two of us had the bill incl. GST and Service coming below $50. But this spend level does not serve a gauge on your own visit, as it really depends on what items and how many you pick....Green tea is served complimentary if you have min. $10 spend per personService was mediocre, but operations efficient and they serve food pretty promptly. Food quality was good, which you can view from the pictures
4
Restaurant was rather crowded on Good Friday at 4+pm. Order many items for family sharing like sushi, chawanmushi, grilled whole mackerel, butter clams, cold soba and all tasted good. Service was also friendly. Damage $60+ for 4 which was a steal. No reservation allowed. Be sure to be early
4
Love this place. Usually come here just for sushi and sashimi. Tempura also quite good. Never2 order teriyaki chicken here. The sauce tasted like cough medicine. Awful.......
The cold soba also quite ok. Overall come here for sushi and sashimi.
5
Best japanese food experience in Singapore. Fast, delicious and supreme quality! Queues must be expected for busy hours
3
Average sushi with average prices. Many varieties of sushis. Nothing special and don't think they are trying to be old - school either.
4
Had the salmon chirashi and tuna roll...both tasty and fresh. This place is always packed, but service is quick. Prices are good for how quality the fish is. I always sit at the sushi bar, but lots of tables, too.
5
A surprise find in Orchard Ion mall. A very reasonable evening out with good food and service. Staff were really accommodating for my 4 yr old which was much appreciated.
4
Out of the variety of sushi eateries in Singapore, Itacho Sushi is my favorite so far. Compared to the Sushi Tei, Sushi Express, Sakae Sushi, Itacho has the freshest and largest spread of sushis. Service is pretty good and the food is amazing! Definitely recommend this to sushi lovers in Singapore if they have yet to try the food at Itacho Sushi :)
4
I've been there Morea than once and not only at the Ion location, but also ath T3 as well as at Plaza Singapura. In all of the three same very good quality, and this means that food quality is a rule for this firm. Choice is quite wide and always top notch in terms of taste and freshness. Always crowded, if alone very rarely you can seat at table but always at bar with too much narrow space.Overall a very good choice
3
Visited in August this year and have been back almost every month! Enjoyed the sushi - fresh and delicious. Not the cheapest restaurant around town but you are guaranteed quality. There is a menu that offers discounted sushi and currently there is a scallop festival. Discounted scallop are on offer, love it!Rice is warm and hand made, not the regular machine made type.We have actually managed to spend around $30 for a nice dinner for two
3
The sushi are quite expensive, but is fresh and nice. However, for the price range, I would save it to eat at another sushi place. This is about $2 for a piece of inari, without the plus plus GST and service charge. For my husband and I, we spent about $30 for lunch which we only ordered a bowl of udon noodles, one inari (one, not a plate of 2 inari), and 3 more other sushi and 2 green teas
3
If you are craving for good, still affordable, and above average sushi then this is the place for you.This sushi restaurant serves higher quality sushi than normal conveyor belt sushi. They have a wide variety of sushi / seafood that you would normally expect to find only in Japan.However, I was expecting to find the same quality as that can be found in their branches in HK, however, and was a little bit disappointed ... I think the rice or preparation they use was slightly different. I also remember the Scallop Sushi in HK to be extraordinary, but it wasn't the same as what I had in the branch here in Singapore.Nevertheless, it is still good quality sushi at a reasonable price
5
Love the sushi here, was always good and fresh.
Roasted Aji sushi was so fresh everytime i ordered. Loved the baked stuffed crab, tuna belly sushi ( negitoro ), salmon belly, roasted ebi sushi, and the lovely hokkaido cheese cake.
5
Right in the middle between a fast food sushi place (which I would hate) and high quality japanese restaurant. Good prices and delicious food no matter what you order
4
The ingredients are fresh and my family's favourite is the foie gras roll. The wasabi, pickled ginger and green tea are definitely of a better quality than the mass market sushi joints. Be prepared to pay a bit more too.
3
Had dinner here.
Can be quite crowded and noisy during peak hours. Sushi quality is not bad for the quality they offer.
5
Best sushi I can find in This area.
I found they have 8 branches in Singapore.
#Ion Orchard
#Plaza Singapura
#Bugis Junction
#Changi Airport (T3)
#The Star vista
#Bedok Mall
#Tampinrs Mall
2
We visited the outlet in Changi airport...
Wasn't really impressed with food nor quality...
Sushi wasn't done properly. They "opened up" before we even attempt to eat!
Won't patronage the outlet at Changi airport again.
4
east access by public transport (MRT / Bus).It is a Japanese fast food setting with fresh fish. Enough choices to spoiled you. They have set lunch at reasonable price. They have promotion items (discount) on sushi and cooked dish can go as low as $0.40 per sushi
1
Been here every time since three years ago. Will be the last and time to look for good Japanese restaurant again :(. Management seems to have changed. Everything shrank in sizes, food taste like instantly made from microwave. Heaps of cheap rice with little or no ingredients. You can taste the preservatives and cheapness in the ingredient. For the $ we spent we would expect quality food. 18% of our bills go to service and GST
4
We were in ION mall and decided to have Japanese for a late lunch. Itacho Sushi was full inside, and there was a queue outside waiting to get in, which we saw as a good sign for a place to eat. We took a number and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. They turn the tables over quickly. Each side of the table has a drawer, in one plates and chopsticks and menus in the other. You mark the items you want and the quantities and hand this to the wait staff. This whole system is very efficient and a good way to get people fed and tables turned over quickly, if at the expense of customer service. We ordered a selection of sushi and chicken yakitori skewers. Everything was very tasty and fresh. The dishes came out quickly and were well presented and generous proportions. We probably ordered too much food but enjoyed every dish. It was also very well priced. We washed it all down with a good bottle of Sake that was again well priced. Definitely recommend for a tasty quick lunch
4
I say this place is very good but of course this is in relation to the price and the kind of restaurant this is (family style casual). There tends to be a queue to get in here so be prepared to take a number a wait for your turn (walk around the other ships while you wait ). You order from the menu and write down what you want. The toro and uni here is not top end but it's not that bad either. I tend to come here when I'm in the mood for a fix of sushi and sashimi and tend to stay away from the hot / fried dishes.
5
Itacho is comfort food for myself and my friends whenever we are feeling down. The quality of the sushi, the quality of service and the variety make going there to eat a pleasure every time.Must trys - their salads are SPECTACULAR! their creative rolls and their wondrous CHAWAMUSHI! If you are craving for jap food in orchard, airport, just head down to itacho and it will see to all your cravings
4
The food here is excellent quality, fresh and reasonably priced. Love sitting at the sushi bar and the atmosphere is great. As I'm a solo traveller & usually eating alone, I never have to wait long for a seat at the sushi bar. There is always a queue of people out the front though. Service is almost zero and can be difficult to get someone to take your order or get another drink. The food however is so great I keep coming back. If you're looking for any kind of service then go elsewhere.
3
The quality and the food presentation is really good. The menu shows a big variety of classical and new Japanese food. The location is a prime shopping area at Ion shopping mall. Reservations are not possible and queuing is not avoidable. Means take a number and wait. Within 20 minutes you should be fine. Be aware last order is just before shops closing at night. It's all about food and not the location.
1
I cannot believe that Japanese food can be so untasty. Even the simple udon broth had no flavor. Service was fast but totally impersonal. Wait staff seemed preoccupied with other issues and had to be prodded repeatedly for every item. This restaurant is NOT slated for a repeat visit
3
My wife and I eat here often,we have tried a lot of the Singapore outlets and the sydney airport one.we normally enjoy it but on our last visit yesterday to the ION outlet the soy sauce was unbearably sweet,which ruined the food totally.Please go back to the soy sauce you had before
4
Having eaten in many mid range sushi restaurants around the world I remain very impressed with the consistent quality I find at Itacho for the price paid. To be able to eat a decent quantity of reasonable sushi for circa $35 SGD is really a great deal. I also like the Itacho outlet at Ion: better decor and more efficient service, although just as brusque as you get in the other branches. I'll be back
4
Got Itacho sushi as a recommendation from a friend living in Singapore and we were not disappointed. Good sushi at affordable price (for being in Singapore). When busy, the staff can get overwhelmed and having a challenge serving everyone as fast as they want. Went there twice and really enjoyed it
4
Definitely one of the best sushi restaurants. You must try their Mentai Sushi!! I love it alot! However,The seats were rather close to one another , not much privacy . Service was good , but the delivery of food was SUPER slow. The price was reasonable around 20++ /pax . I'll def visit again , i think the sushi is really good !!View more pictures here:http://sandy-xx.blogspot.sg/2014/05/restaurant-review-itacho-sushi.htm

Came here on the recommendation of a friend that it was better than Genki. The fish was less than average and overpriced, but the service was just atrocious. We spent more time trying to get someone to take our order and getting drinks than we did eating. When half of our order failed to come out, they told us it was unavailable until after 6:30 (it was 6:20 and nowhere on the menu did it state that). Rather than telling us when we ordered it, they just brought out half the order, then we had to reorder the same stuff five minutes later. By the time we left, there was a huge line of people waiting outside, despite the fact there were ample empty seats that had just not been cleared. Seriously, get it together folks! You're lucky people are still coming here
4
one of my favourite sushi place since 4 years ago. If you have enough of cheap sushi with only artificial crabmeat, puny shrimps, pork floss as topping. Itacho is the place to go. I can't say that the sushi here can be considered as delicacy but nevertheless it is fresh, good quality and quantity. Itacho is one of the few sushi shops that I am willing to eat my sushi without soya sauce nor wasabi simply to taste the freshness and the sweetness of the ric
3
Good authentic sushi. However due to its popularity, you may need to wait a lot to get entry. Also they made quite a few mistakes in our order, though they corrected it when it was pointed out.
5
Anyday dining means you can go any day and it is affordable. They have specials between $2-5. Quality of food is good and fresh. Sashimi is not fishy, served slightly cold unlike some places warm. I love the jumbo hotate sushi.
4
Had early dinner here around 5:30pm so there was no queue at all. Waitresses didn't really explain how to order so we had to ask. Their prices are slightly more expensive compared to Sushi Tei but its nicer than Sushi Tei and more variety. Their specials menu is super worth it as you get up to 50% discount on certain sushi/sashimi
3
Various sushi under reasonable price, the freshness is ok, not really distinguish but the grilled sushi menu is recommended. Previously, I was really love the premium eel dish (the serve the whole piece) but the taste is somehow not as usual. Better pick up the queue first before doing something else as you may have to wait up to 1 hour
3
The food items here were average in taste and the prices of the special items were quite reasonable. But the queue outside was really long and consisted mainly of the young and trendy. The waitresses were really trying to rush us as there was a long queue outside - something we could understand but made the dining experience not really pleasant
3
We wanted a quick sushi in the Ion Mall and ended up here. There was a long line but moved very quickly. We were seated and not given any instructions. We figured it out by watching the diners around us. Under the table, there is a drawer with the menu and order sheet. You fill out what you want. On the opposite side, the plates, chopsticks, wet towels were found. And you can order as you go or one large order and they will deliver when it's ready. Nothing exceptional. It was all right. Bit on the expensive side
3
Tried out Itacho Sushi at Bedok Mall. Service was a little bit slow. Food (Sushi) was tasty. Teriyaki Chicken on rice wasn't great; first there was barely teriyaki sauce and second, rice was a bit hard. Price is reasonable, environment is friendly. Although I am giving it a 3 (of which I think it deserves) I would definitely go back there for sushi.

My fiancÃ© and I arrived at 1530, no one waiting and tables available yet took 15 minutes to be seated.Had to beg staff to take the order slips, drinks order arrived after 15 minutes only after asking where are they.Swordfish sashimi turned up frozen, salmon belly sashimi badly cut with questionable dark squiggles Avocado on sushi was rotten, when I turned it over revealed how black it was.2nd Worst Japanese dining experience I have ever ha

In bustling ION mall and with a huge crowd of younger Singaporeans waiting to be seated at meal times this place was jumping!Staff is running around frantically to keep up with the demands made on them and they dont really succeed.In fairness with the circus that is going on in this place, its hard to completetly fault the staff- they need to revisit their processes imho.Where I was underwhelmed was the sushi- i guess it was perfectly acceptable if you dont mind mayonnaise and orders getting mixed up- watching massive pieces of salmon or buckets full of scallops being prepared infront of you (as I was at the sushi bar) then you will be OK.Call me a traditionalist, but if you want to have a sushi bar and seat people infront of it, avoid turning the area into a scene of mass production...get the orders right and try to make it feel amd taste like sushi should be..failure to do so (as was the case during this meal) kills the effect and the rest of the decor.Would return if I was in a rush and alone

This place is very popular among customers below 30 years of age. There's s queue during lunch and dinner hours, even during afternoon tea time it is filled. Perhaps due to words of mouth and prime location. The sushi is special for the price you paid, and the recipe is refined compare to the sushi belt mass chain store. The menu is extensive and interesting. However the seats are too close to each other, it is a place for those who want nothing but just to have a good meal

A big range of different Sushi, I can only highly recommend this place. Like almost everywhere in Singapore you have to bit patient, there will be mostly a long queue of people who wants to go in there.

The first time eating at itacho sushi. Most of the food is good and great value. Looking forward to come back again.

Was here again for a quick tea break at 4pm and order some salmon and tuna sushi. The salmon was ok but it seems that the tuna today was not really fresh...Been here a number of times and this was the first time the fish did not taste fresh... So I assumed maybe today's scenario was one out of a million... As their prices are very reasonable, I believe I will still be going back to eat in the future and hopefully, will get them fresh

Itacho is one of my favourite sushi places, when it comes to Japanese food in a mall. They have a great variety of sushi, and my favourite is the roasted dorsal sushi. Done well (most times I've ordered it here it's been done well) the fish melts in your mouth and the roasting gives it a slight buttery feel. You have to try to it know what I mean. At $2.70 a piece (after discount) it is not cheap but I order it every single time I visit Itacho. In fact, I had a friend who once ordered 14 of it - that made up the core of her lunch meal!The set lunches are priced very reasonably too - you can get 10 sushi for slightly over $10, and the variety is decent too. Comes with miso soup to boot. I like that they educate the public on how best to eat Wasabi, i.e. not to mix it into your soy sauce

We decided to try this place out after church as we always see q outside the restaurant.We asked to be seated at the sushi counter as we missed those time we had in Japan. Anyway, the seafood was fresh nonetheless and the vinegar on our sushi rice is just right. Innovative menu with lotsa of sushi choices and not forgetting mains.However, the service is poor though the sushi masters at the counter did give us that occasional smile. Our green tea was not topped up and we had trouble getting our hand written orders to our servers

I had always wanted to try this place as they always have long lines of people during lunch time. I went for a late lunch and ordered a la carte instead of the set meals. Had about seven kinds of sushi including the raw wagyu and anago. The overall quality of the sushi was poor and the wagyu for 6.80 was a joke. Was clearly frozen and thawed and not fresh. The anago looked like plastic and tasted like plastic. The miso soup was alright but the sushi really was a joke and a rip off. There's much better to be had if you're paying 40 bucks.(like Tomi Sushi at Parco Millenia Walk

Was surprise that this place has alot of branch in Singapore and yet, they have always maintained their quality. Been to Ion branch and Singapore plaza branch. One of my favourite Japanese sushi place. Good sweet prawns. Salmon belly. And always they have a special price for in house promotion and are fresh. On average, spend about SGD80 for two. Love!

Just had dinner at Itacho Sushi at the star vista. When we got there, there was a bit of a queue, wich made us think it was going to be good. Once in (we sat at the bar, so go in fairly quick), we were clearly there at peak hour, as the sushi making lady in front of us probably had 40-50 orders in front of her... ours came in quite early, but as there does not seem to be a good first in-first out system, my sushi was literally the last one she served. THey also needed reminding to bring our drinks. To top it all, they seem to put large amounts of mayonnaise on many of the sushis they make, which I had never seen before. The teriyaki chicken with rice was also average.By the time we left, the queue was probably 20-30 people. All the waiters and sushi making personnel were nice when leaving, it just seems like they could not handle the flow of orders. They need less waiters and more sushi makers.Food for 2 was 35 SGD, which was a decent price.The place does look quite nice, and the shopping mall was pretty as well

I ordered item #22 from the menu. It didnt say that the top of the pork is an uncooked egg yolk. The picture is small so I didnt quite see the egg yolk. When the food arrived, i asked the manager about the egg yolk. She said it is obvious from the picture. She said " too bad" She didn't offer anything other than it is obvious from the picture. So please don't trust the picture of the foods there. The manager did not even offer to cook the yolk

This Itacho sushi has the longest n waiting time as compared to star vista/ plaza Singapura and Changi airport T 3.But the wait is worth it especially after hours of shopping on weekend. Just pop in grab a seat at counter and dig in.Ikura charwamushi and their hamachi and hotate sashimi is fresh and juicy

very authentic, fresh with good variety. The price is reasonable for its quality and won't burn a hole in your pocket as compared to many high end Japanese sushi restaurant

Having always been deterred by the long queues outside the Ion branch, I'd not thought about dining here. However there was an occasion when there was a queue & I was looking for a place to lunch. Sat at the counter & ordered a selection of sushi. The surprise is that the sushi is of a decent standard, superior to the likes of chains like Sushi Tei. One thing that sets Itacho apart is their use of warm sushi rice instead of stone cold. This makes a different to the taste as I have found in higher end sushi restaurants. Freshness of the seafood is also paramount & this place didn't disappoint. Where this restaurant needs to brush up on is their service. Or rather lack of it. It is difficult to attract the attention of the servers as they seem to be in a mad rush all the time & do not make eye contact. My request for a top up of hot water for my tea was ignored despite two reminders. The server who cashed me out looked like I had inconvenienced her but I had no choice as the cashier station was unmanned. I could well have walked out. At the end of the day they could do well to observe what their competitors were up to in this area

I visited Itacho Sushi a few times at different branches, namely the branch at Ion Orchard, Doby Gaut & recently at JCube Jurong. In my opinion, their sushi are comparable to the ones at Sushi Tei & of course much better than Sakae Sushi. They do have regular promotions for certain sushi, e.g. roasted scallop sushi (which is a must try). Ambience wise is noisy at the branch over at Ion & Doby Gaut, the queue is always very long and you have to wait for around 30 min. The queue at JCube is much better and not as noisy as well. Service is not as fast, probably due to overwhelming amount of customers. Maybe they should employ more staffs at times which are busier? To sum it up, it is a place for delicious sushi & meals at an affordable price

I've heard quite a bit about Itacho Sushi (good reviews) and have always seen a queue outside the various outlets. Hence when I saw the very short queue at late lunchtime, I thought of giving it a try. It was around 2pm, and the restaurant was nearly full although most diners were almost finished with their meal.Considering the prices, I was somewhat surprised that the ordering system was self-service. The service was ok, although the food did take a while to arrive - about 25-30minutes after ordering, which was a surprise as quite a number of diners had left since we sat and ordered.The quality of food was acceptable although not all were consistently good - we had the California hand roll (better than the California roll), California roll, deep fried mentaiko scallop, Tanba set, grilled pork hand roll, soft shell crab hand roll, roasted egg with curry lobster (something different but not strongly recommended), roasted scallop with mentaiko and a few of the 50% specials. The overall experience was ok, but I wouldn't go again if there was a queue - the other chains are just as or if not even better. In terms of value for money, the buffet at irodori is definitely my preference

Decided to find out why there was always a queue outside this place in the Ion shopping center. Typically 10-15 minutes wait. Reasonable priced sushi, good well sized sushi topping portions, some interesting specials and also good quality fish etc. Service is a bit patchy though and understaffed and dont ask for takeaway as it will also take 15-20 minutes as well. Worth a return visi

My family has been Itacho fan since the day they started their operation in Singapore. We used to visit the Ion branch until they opened the The Star Vista branch and it has been our one and only sushi place to go almost 3 to 4 times a week. The amazing thing about Itacho is they do maintain their quality. Till now we have never been disappointed with their service and the quality of food. Yes there is alway the queue but trust me, when you put your sushi in your mouth, the queue is worth waiting for. We've grown so attach to this place that if is sushi it has to be from Itacho

I visited Itacho for quick dinner. They have varieties of sushi and some side dishes. All sushi dishes are freshly made by chef in the counter.I tried tuna, salmon roe, roll sushi and salmon. They are reasonably fresh and OK.The service is not very efficient. I had to wait for quite some time for my additional order. If you go there, try ordering what you want at once. As I love sushi, I would pay little bit more to go to other proper sushi places, if I find anything better

We had a nice dinner, which was fast and quite good. Sushis were excellent, sashimi as well, miso quite good. Only drawback were crab sticks (as opposed to stated crab meat) in the salads. However service was fast and OK (even that not all of the waiters were english-speaking). Price was absolutely OK for only sushi place in upscale mal

I am one of the itacho sushi fan and used to go the outlet in ion-orchard. Usually has a long queue there.But this time, we went to plaza singapura outlet for a small gathering with friends. The sushi prices are reasonable and quality is good compare with others brand chain outlets. However, the service is super poor. One of the china ladies need to re-train in her service manner. We have seated there more than 15mins; the teas not serve and just said ok. At this time, the restaurant is not busy so please look at her service attitude

We went to the branch restaurant in Bugis Square. The miso soup was sour. The eel was not that great. The edamame was old & rough. Overly priced sushi. I've been to other sushi restaurants that serve a much high quality sushi at a fraction of the price
