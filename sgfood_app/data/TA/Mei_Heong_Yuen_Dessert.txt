The fantastic traditional desserts with consistent quality and ocleanliness. From one shop lot to 3! The famous pick is the paste choices of paste - walnut, sesame, almond and peanuts!
5
We stumbled on this place while taking a short cut.
Fantastic place and the mango cakes were great.The peanut ice was so good that we went back the next day.
4
I really enjoyed my dessert here. We had the Strawberry and Mango and the Chendol Snow Ice. Both were very tasty but I would say the Mango could use some more flavour.
I recommend making a visit.

After a exploring the hidden secrets and gems of Singapore Chinatown and discovering the local cuisine at the hawker center and street food vendors, Mei Heong Yuen is the place to head to for dessert. We were brought here by my Singaporean friend who told us the this place is one of the few original dessert shops in Chinatown. Truly there is a reason for it to remain. Menu was pretty much straight forward. We were here for dessert. We had mango-pomelo sago and warm almond paste. Service was excellent. Orders came within 8 minutes from placing. Price is very reasonable
4
Just hear the song by Manhattan Transfer and walk the streets..... Temple street isn't such a little street but it meets the style.. This place with it iced desserts is just one of those things you should do in Singapore....to temper those hot sweaty days in between beers.Enjoy the dessert
4
We went to the outlet in 321 mall.Their dumpling in ginger soup is done perfectly which has a good balance of spiciness and sweetness. The shaved ice almost like a bingsu was well done as well. Good place to hang out after a movie or a meal.
4
We were walking along on the streets of Chinatown and when we spotted a massive line of tourists, our curiosity got the better of us; and I'm glad it did! Mei Heong Yuen has been operating for more than 50 years and is famous for their sesame and almond pastes. We opted for a Watermelon & Lychee snow ice and it tasted as good as it looked! The whole thing was very natural, not sweet nor artificial and super refreshing . The lychee popping balls and jelly made it even more fun to eat when you scooped everything up in one spoonful. Such perfect refreshment for a hot day, especially when there are 18 flavours of snow ice and 40 desserts in general to choose from
5
I had a shaved iced dessert after two hours of shopping at their Velocity outlet. The Taiwan Snow Ice Chendol is such a treat, fill with red beans, green rice flour jelly, coconut milk, gula Melaka and sweeten palm seeds plus black jelly inside mountains of soft and smooth shaved ice. What a wonderful dessert to beat the heat. The best in Singapore
3
The dessert place only takes cash. I had the green mango snow shaved ice. First time having snow ice. Nothing amazing or great about it. The snow ice lacked flavour. I know some have a milky sweet flavour to it. This one was very bland but not quite plain as straight shaved ice. The green mango flavour seemed artificial. I should have stuck to the sago mango dessert everyone talks about. Not sure if I will return.
4
SG has restricted most fun. Indeed, the news last night was that some youth have experimented with balloons more than once. For real. That's why it is such a surprise to visit Mei Heong Yuen, where diabetes highs start at just $3. The locals though, they are eating mango pomelo sabo, or red bean slop, hot or cold. I also recommend the ginger pudding. For $3.50 you will be buzzing.MHYD seems like a great place to go after dinner if you are in Chinatown, don't care about your body, but don't want to drink alcohol. HOT TIP FOR INFLUENCERS AND INSTAGRAMMERS: order the chendol snow ice to keep your squares like
4
a cool place to relax and have dessert...
Had the Chendol snow Ice and peanut Ah Balling. Both are great.
4
Variety of choice to choose from hot to cold. Suitable for younger as well as eldery. Always full with people but dessert serve very fast...
3
This is a dessert shop. A little like those in HK but not so pack.
Nothing to talk about the ambience. Service is so so.
Dessert wise is average to good.
4
We had peanuts and sesame paste plus additional dumping balls. First try and i would recommend my friends to go whenever visit Singapore. Price are reasonable too it just the cashier no smile on her face when we order and pay.
4
The standard has dropped. It's $3.50 for the peanut paste. The stall is crowded and need to wait for seats. The traditional desserts seems better then the soft snow ice dessert.
4
Food was not that mind blowing, but very good for the price. I genuinely enjoyed my meal and the selection was quite wide.
3
This shop has been here for many years. Used to be a small shop and it expanded with air conditioning. Came here around 10.45am for a quick dessert. Most of the patrons were tourists who ordered their flavoured shaved ice. We ordered their mango pomelo sabo which is 1 of their signature items. It has a thick consistency and not diluted. Their other signature items include black sesame paste, almond paste and steamed milk egg.
3
Been visiting singapore several times and had no chance to try . Service is so so, taste average.. i choose Mango and Durian flavour and taste standard.I dont know , maybe i wrongly choose the item in the menu. But to be honest much fancy F&N Magnolia ice cream at The Orchard Hawker
5
We try the Sesame Snow Ice and The Mango Snow Ice, the sesame snow ice taste so-so, but because we looking around and mostly ordering the mango snow ice, we also order mango snow ice and it taste GREAT! Service are so-so Toilet are quite bad. There are Three Adjoining room, room A for Non-AC, Room B for Semi-AC , and Room C for AC.
4
great place to come for desserts in chinatown. the hot desserts are really good and even though it cost more than some other places, they are not as sweet. just the right texture and amount of sugar. the snow ice desserts are pretty decent. the place is nice and air conditioned, service pretty fast. only parking could be a bit of problem if you drive
5
The fantastic traditional desserts with consistent quality and cleanliness. From one shop lot to 3! The famous pick is the paste choices of paste - walnut, sesame, almond and peanuts!
1
Don't know where the hype came from.. maybe it's a old dessert place... but the food itself is sooooo average.. we ordered the mango sago, mango wrap and black rice milk. tasted horrible. Can go to any HongKong dessert place to get better desserts
4
Been here quite a few times. I always like the desserts here. Sweetness is always just nice, but the portion is small. A lil pricey but due to the location, so is reasonable. Will come back again
3
Customer service was excellent. We ordered the frost ice dessert with black sesame. It was OK. Didnt get a chance to try other items. May be the other items are better.
5
The gingko bean curd dessert is excellent. Bean curd is blended and tastes like milk. High quality cantonese dessert selling at a reasonable price.
1
This place used to be good for desert but now is so catered to tourists the desert below standard and stingy in the ingredients. Would not recommend to come for it if you need to queue. Bad customer service too...impatient staff!
4
This traditional, heritage dessert stall had grown in size since its humble inception.The menu also grew. They now offer the soft snow ice dessert.My favourite is the Bubble tea flavour (as in the picture). It's like the ice cream equivalent of a bubble milk tea drink.The bubbles cleverly carried the tea taste while the ice carried the creamy milk taste.One more thing, although it's a dessert joint, their chee cheong fun was nice to
4
We went to this desert stall at Chinatown hawker center, and we had an enjoyable experience. This was our first trip to Singapore, and we heard about a lot about the famous Singapore hawker centers, including the variety of choices, affordable prices, and even Michelin starred soy chicken rice which we went with a very satisfying taste. So, we went and tried this dessert stall; it has a good selection of 20 or more of various Chinese desserts, but we only ordered two, one for mango ice and another for triple color ice, and both were tasted and refreshing. It was solid choice for refreshment place, recommending.
5
It is a new dessert that probably first appear 10 years ago. The shaved ice texture is so so fine that you do not new to chew at all. Yet it doesn't melt easily!When you press it hard enough using your spoon, the texture became like gelato.In short, heavenly taste! I ordered one matcha with red bean. It is acceptable.Price: around 8SGDLocation: very strategic in china townCleanliness: goo
1
What used to be good old traditional Chinese dessert is becoming commercial and not prepared with a heart. It's mainly to bluff tourists that it's a taste of Singapore. Ingredients of my dried beancurd with ginko barley have become just 20% of each serving, 80% soup. I almost couldn't find my gingko nuts. Barley only bits. Seriously disappointing. Has the economy taken a toll on the ingredients but I'm paying for the same price. Nothing special, no need to try if you are a tourist. Go to the nearby hawker is better.
1
This place used to see better days. The bean curd barley only had two ginkos. We see lesser locals here now and mostly unsuspecting foreigners.
It's better to skip this dessert place and head to Chinatown Hawkers center for some authentic Chinese dessert.
4
I order mango and strawberry snow ice, and 3 color carrot cakes.
The ice is delicious, not too sweet, and very soft, and not easy to melt.
The cakes is so so.
4
One of the better dessert stops in Chinatown. On a hot day, the ice dessert here are very comforting. Please try is you are around here.
4
A nice place to try chinese desserts. The place is busy and the options are plenty and they are fast and sufficient. There are couple places like this around but this seems thd busiest, get there a bit early.
3
Always crowded here. Their carrot cake is good. First time trying their herbal jelly and it wasn't nice at all.
5
It's a restaurant that just sells deserts. How can one object?
Well they are so far all tasty and attractive. The price is good too.
This is my mocha ice mountain.
Yummy
5
After a long day sightseeing we were looking for a refreshing drink and stumbled across this traditional Chinese dessert restaurant in Chinatown. We selected a mocha ice dessert and two of us shared it. It was delicious and very good value at around $5. You can definitely share these between two people.
3
This is your usual neighbourhood dessert stall at first glance. The popular ice desserts flavour are cendol, pineapple, green tea and durian. We tried the durian. It's just normal. The durian taste wasn't very heavy nor can taste authentic. I give a star for its special appealling and another for the fact the ice doesn't melt quickly
4
Went with my family to the branch at Chinatown Point. Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Lime and Mocha ice. The desserts were served quickly, same as the previous time at the other outlet, within 5 mins of ordering. However, the amount of ice given was definitely lesser than the one at the temple st outlet. Probably because rent is higher at a shopping mall? So instead of increasing prices, they give a smaller quantity? The taste was still good. Definitely will visit again in the futur
5
After polishing off some satays we were looking for something sweet. Mei Heong Yuen was a 15 min walk and rated number 1 in Singapore for desserts. So off we went.The shaved ice dessert is like nothing I've had before. There were so many choices but we settled for Lychee and Watermelon Snow Ice and the Egg Pudding with Ginger (hot). They were fantastic and we can't wait to go back for more.A word of warning, this place was very busy and at about 9.30 approx, they started pulling the shutters down do it appears that they are firm on their closing times
5
This great, air-con dessert restaurant needs to be in your list of 'must dos' while you're in Singapore. I recommend the glutinous rice balls. They are soft and chewy and have either peanut or black sesame seed centres. Great end to our evening.
4
When people ask about dessert place in Chinatown, i will think of here. There are a lot of variety and I like the mango sago more. The other like hot dessert also tasted good. I brought my foreign friend there, they like it too.
4
Their dessert is nice and value for money. Especially their HK Dumpling which is able to satisfy your taste bud.
5
The shop is always crowded, and need to wait for seat approximate 10-15 minutes, the all dessert are very delicious, will come again if I back here.
4
We ordered 2 bowls of yam paste, 1 Milk Tea ice and 1 mango roll. The desserts came around 1-5 mins of ordering, which was awesome! For $5.50, it is affordable, but could have been a bit cheaper.The milk tea ice was yummy, the flavor was there but a bit too sweet for my liking. The mango roll was just slices of mango wrapped in some jelly skin (forgot the word for it). Would have preferred it by itself. (the mango)Overall, good place to come to if you don't like to wait. Might not have enough seats though, during certain times of the day
4
Came here for dessert after dinner. The place was really crowded, must be a popular place.We ordered Yam Paste and Milk-Tea Shave Ice.The Yam Paste was smooth and tasty; though not as flavorful as those we've had in other high-class restaurants. Still, it tasted good.The ice in the Milk-Tea shave ice had a smooth texture; probably because it's finely shaved, definitely more fine than the shaved ice you might get at hawker center. The milk-tea flavor wasn't evenly distributed throughout: stronger in some parts of the ice than others.We also tried their Mango wrap, which was basically slices of mango wrapped in some dessert skin. It was nice but not something to die for.We definitely like the variety of desserts available here, and felt that the price was reasonable enough that we might visit again
4
Try the soft ice cream that was so high. I shared it with my family. Not to sweet, but very tasty. Makes it different with anywhere else. The main restaurant is so small, but they have another place next to the main one. You have to order and state your table number. But the waitress will tell you little bit rude, when you stay little bit longer than the time you are finishing the desserts you ordered when they are busy. But I will come again anyway next time I visit Singapore
5
We visited the outlet in Chinatown Point. Over the years, we started out at this location and also at the Novena location. In recent years, our travels had taken us more in the Bugis area, so we gravitated toward dessert stores there. Yesterday, we decided to try Mei Heong again. It did not disappoint. We all had versions of snow ice, including black sesame, mango, durian and soursop. The snow ice is prepared in such a way that the texture is more like ice cream than ice. Toppings were flavorful and plentiful. Definitely a good place
5
The pictures says a thousand words. This place has been around for a very long time. They sell the best peanuts and local desserts loved dearly. For some time now, they served up our local delights with a twist to cater to the hot hot hot weather in Singapore. Must try, the shaved iced cendol, made with shaved ice of coconut and drippping with Gula Melaka (pour at your own risk) and mango shaved ice. Totally would just go there and no where else for my cravings.
5
Mei Heong Yuen is a favorite dessert restaurant among locals as well as tourists. At the entrance is the take away counter. Inside are two rooms--usually packed-- to eat in. There are even long tables that were reserved for tour groups! Choose any of the Snow Ice options. They're soft, powdery and tasty. We tried the Soursop Snow Ice along with a favorite, the Mango Pomelo Ice. Love.it
5
Just to finish a great meal, headed from Mosque St to Temple St and had some dessert. Don't skip the Chendol whatever you do - it's delicious !!!!
4
Cantonese dessert cafe, perfect spot for a night cap. I tried the warm almond with egg white dessert, it was delicately flavored and comforting. Quite a big serve for that dessert so would share it next time.
4
There is nothing that cools you down in over 30 degrees celsius weather in Singapore faster than a nice cold bowl of dessert and there is no place in Chinatown better than Mei Heong Yuen. You can even have a choice of hot or cold dessert, even though this dessert store is better for their hot dessert. Nothing above S$10 for a portion big enough for 2 people, their dessert makes it a pit stop necessity for any one looking to cool down after browsing in Chinatown
4
I ordered the walnut paste dessert which was smooth and good. Packed cold the 3 pieces cake - carrot, yam and pumpkin; and chicken glutinous rice for next day consumption. Was well packed and given chilli also. Good experience overall and all transactions on cash term. Of course their items are slightly expensive since in a mall. I would go again for their other desserts
4
After a great savoury meal on Chinatown's food street, this little establishment makes for the perfect place to go and have a dessert. It is much cheaper here than at any of the street vendors, and they allow one to take away and eat outside with your friends finishing their meal. When we visited, shortly after lunch, they had only three ice cream flavours left. A pity, but among the durian and mango they also had strawberry: just what I was looking for. At $2 a scoop, the prices were more than reasonable and actually cheaper than one would pay in the UK by a few pennies ($2 is about Â£1.20). The scoops, actually, are completely enormous. Two scoops here more than filled a large pot, the waiter was so generous with the quantity. Upon eating it outside, I was mildly impressed. Whilst not the best strawberry ice cream I have ever had, it had a nice balance with strawberries and cream that leant slightly more towards the cream side, but with nice big frozen strawberry chunks in the dessert itself. It was rather pleasant
4
This restaurant is strategically located along Temple Street and is always full of customers be it day or night. Customer are required to make order and payment over at the counter first and the dessert will be served at your table shortly upon order. We enjoyed our dessert and highly recommend it to those who are looking for traditional dessert in Chinatown. Beside the traditional chinese dessert, they also have varieties of flavoured shaved ice on their menu
4
Visited Mei Heong Yuen Dessert Parlour for dessert with friends after lunch. Aircon clean restaurants at conservation houses along Temple Street.Tasty desserts at affordable prices. Waiters and waitresses took order and make payment at the cashier. Bowls of warm desserts served. Average prices about $3 - $5.Really enjoyed. Will visit again
5
When my parents went to Singapore with the cruise, they met their friend in Singapore and took them to this place which was popular for their unusual dessert, they have never seen anything like it. Now I have been here as they kindly took me along on this trip. The desserts were good and refreshing 
4
Great spot for a little sweet treat and a break from the heat! They closed at 10pm which seems a little early for a dessert shop but worth a visit so plan to get there before closing time. A nice selection of Cantonese and shaved ice style desserts. Tried the warm Almond with Egg White which was delicious and a generous portion. Would recommend it both to locals and for travelers.
4
In the heart of Chinatown, this is a local popular dessert restaurant. About 30-40 seats available. Aircon without WIFI.A wide choices of hot and cold dessert ranging from $3 - $7. Also a choice of light snacks.Placed order and made payment at the cashier counter. Dessert will be served to your designated table. Waitresses speak little English but can order via the menu indicated by numbers. Sweet dessert at affordable prices.Enjoyed. Will come again
4
We went there last night,their kind and their service is fast.
I would recommend the Che Cheong fun. It is nice and a hot dessert.For the snow ice it very cold and gives you brain freeze!!!
1
Is look good in the picture and the real but no taste! No flavor! Lot of customer can't tell everything. $11 for two is kinda waste money.
3
I came here for the first time 6 years ago and was very impressed by the flavourful durian snow ice dessert. It used to taste very strong and fresh and the mountain of snow was huge. I visited frequently during my four month stay. Upon my most recent visit, I was most disappointed to find the portion was at least half the size and the durian snow ice had very little flavour. Whatever flavour was used was artificial and not quite even durian. I ordered durian on the side to complement and it was the only source of flavour. It is sad to see this decline given that this place's claim to fame was the fact that the snow tasted as though the fresh fruit was packed in the ice before it was shaved. Definitely doubt there is any fresh fruit used in the ice. Very disappointing and does not deserve the acclaim until it goes back to its original quality. Perhaps the traditional desserts are more worthy
3
My wife was in Singapore on exchange in 2011 and had raved about this place. She finally had a chance to return this year and took me along to share her experience, and we both wound up fairly disappointed by the quality of the dessert. The portions are now small (they used to be enormous) and the actual taste of the snow ice dessert is considerably blander with heavy use of artificial sauces. It's not terrible but it definitely no longer deserves its place at the top of TripAdvisor's list of dessert spots. This can be skipped
1
Will never ever wan go back anymore. Mango roll was spoil but still serve. When after we inform the server, they refuse to change and told us that we don't know how to enjoy this type of dessert. Tasteless mango sago as stated is their signature item maybe this is their signature reason? Bad experience ever
3
It's my second visit for this venue.This time, it's a Green Tea snow ice, and it is rather bland, and it's glutenous rice despite it's large size doesn't taste as good as certain shop in my hometown.But overally is a good place to chill during the heat in Chinatown area, hopefully their staff speak English
5
Me and my wife had our dessert at Mei Heong Yuan Dessert located at Temple Street, China Town. The Dessert Shop is not big in scale but it is well known for its’ wide range of Traditional Desserts & Local Snacks. We have visited this Dessert Shop on many occasions and each time, it was fully packed with customers. However, the turnover of customers is very fast. People just came to have their dessert and move on within minutes and we needn’t have to wait for long before someone vacates their seats. We had our favorite Sesame Paste with Almond which is very smooth and delicious. Definitely worth to check it out if you enjoy Traditional Chinese Desserts
4
What attracted us to the eatery were the countless 'catalogue' photos of shaven ice dessert concoctions.Indeed it was some menu - what we like is that they had the traditional no-frill desserts like the nut paste broths (we had the black sesame; the walnut; and the almond which were nice, not too sweet) and yam with sweet potato and ginkgo nuts which was quite good. From the numerous shaven ice offerings (green tea/red bean; chendol, mango, chocolate etc) we ordered the soursop which we gave a thumbs down, the natural taste of the few pieces soursop pulp was lost in the sweet syrup).Besides sweet desserts, we noticed that they also served savouries like yam cakes and meat dumplings.Like most tong sui joints, it was a small eatery which packed in many tiny tables with very elbow room. Not quite the place for a leisurely after-meal sweet
5
A must go dessert place in Singapore. Delicious cheap desserts. Always packed with locals and tourists. A great place to take a few friends or family. Not being local but a traveler visiting it was nice to be shown this place and have it added to our places to go. Desserts are very cheap compared to Australia which is what we are use to. Very casual atmosphere, fast turn around.
3
Initially this was a good place for dessert but after they expanded their shop from 1 shop to 3 shop, the experience there became bad. Business there is very good thus staff are very unfriendly, i would say that some are pretty rude. They would keep your bowl once you have finish your food with a impression that they want you to leave the shop, not giving you the luxury of time to chat with friends or what. If you wanna linger there for a longer period, i suggest that you don't finish your food so fast as you will feel awkward to stay longer once the table is empty as people will stare at you. Prices for the dessert are affordable but i would say that they are not price friendly. A very small bowl of dessert may easily cost 4 sgd and quality of dessert has also declined
4
Good visit with locals (Singaporeans) to this desert place. They offer typical iced and savoury Cantonese deserts.
5
I've been to both outlets at Temple Street and Chinatown Point. I love the Black Sesame paste and Walnut paste to bits. Mango Sago is recommended too. The paste desserts are very aromatic and thick in terms of ingredients, and very smooth in texture. yummy!!
5
Excellent, cheap authentic and local dessert option in the heart of Singapore Chinatown!
All desserts were excellent ... the crazy ginger soup with machi filled machi rice balls and the mango puree with ice were favorites!
4
The tropical humidity in Singapore can get awfully brutal, but this dessert place offers a quick relief. Do try the sesame almond, green tea and mango strawberry. The Chinatown outlet gets busy all the time. Be patient in getting a seat.
5
Been to both outlets at Temple St and Chinatown Point. Always enjoyed their dessert, esp the mix almond and black sesame cream, and mix walnut and peanut cream. Good place for local dessert.
3
1stly, i dislike the service in this outlet. The staff are rude and loud. No customer service at all. secondly, the standard of dessert has dropped over the years. The mango pomelo sago was excellent about 5 yrs ago but now it is just So So. It is an OK place to go since you are in Chinatown. Not much of varieties. Service is quick
3
Visited on 7th April 16' with friend in the afternoon,almost 1/3 full tables. Due to 34Â°C hot temperature,majority order tge ice dessert. Both of us tried the Almond n black sesame snow ice w almond flakes. So is a white n black snow ice version. Find that the black sesame,taste a bit bitter n the white portion-almond flavour is good. There r savoury choices of fried/steamed carrot/yam cake. Find the dessert is pricey as $6.50 for each snow ice. But the whole shop is cold as its aircon is strong. As for service,their clearing of tables is fast but a lady doesn't allowed us to sit at a row of tables. She point us to the back saying that we r just 2 persons only.
1
Went to the ION outlet on level B4 yesterday and discovered that all their prices have been removed off the menu on the wall. They increased their prices! No wonder the place was rather empty. It used to be very crowded before the prices shot up. A disappointment
4
Remember there is a outlet but can't find it. Decide to give out but at the mrt entrance and see the sign broad. Go back to correct unit. Order sesame paste and chendol snow ice. It is good to go back as it taste good and yummy
4
Back to this lovely dessert shop during chinese new year, realised the price increased quite considerably. Everything was lovely like almond egg white and black seasame paste... So smooth. But what spoils it all was it signature mango dessert.. Its shockingly sour! Maybe not the right season... Well at least now we know there is no added sugar!
4
Go to Chinatown this afternoon and weather is so hot. Go to Mei Being Yuen for the snow ice dessert. Order for the famous mango ice and sesame ice. It is good and not so sweet. It really cool down the body. Cool...
4
Been there for 3 times :)
First time i ate almond & sesame soft ice. Second time i ate durian soft ice. Third time i tried to taste their hot dessert. Conclusion: i prefer to eat their soft ice :)
5
My local dining companion came back again...my friend really enjoyed the Mango Pudding and I had the Snow Ice Chendol.....Yum to both,
Don't miss this place if you are near Temple St......the menu choices will tempt for more than one dish!
4
had a glutinous rice ball with ginger soup there.. yummy! there have a various snow ice with many flavors also,have not tested this yet, looks so tempting. definitely will come back to try snow ice next time.
4
Because it was just before lunch time, i managed to only order one of it's most popular dessert Mango Snow Ice.It's was much much better than the one you normally have in the food court, both serving size and taste.Will bring family over when visiting Singapore next time
5
It was my 2nd visit to this place since 2 years back. Powerful dessert!!!I had the Mango Sago, Chee Cheong Fun and the Cheng Tng. Fuuyooh!!! I love them.The shop has many tables. Good for couples and families. Ordering is self order to the cashier and payment on the spot.The shop was half full when i visited and the service was fast. Probably about 10 minutes. Not bad.Will come back again in few weeks time to try out their other desserts. Yummy!!
3
Wilting from the Singapore humidity and heat outdoors, I stumbled into the air-conditioned haven of Mei Heong Yuen. It's a large place, spanning three shop houses with a perpetual stream of patrons. They are famous for the towering snow ice desserts but as I was dining solo, I stuck with the more manageable chng thng, a classic Chinese dessert soup. It contained a tasty assortment of dried longan, gingko nuts, barley and candied wintermelon among other things, cooked in a sugar syrup. The shop(s?) is located near Ann Siang Hill and makes a good pitstop if you're exploring Chinatown on foot
5
I visited Mei Heong Yuen China Town with my friends and we were all very satisfied with all desserts we had, especially the Green Tea Snow Ice! We tried Durian Snow Ice also but the taste was not strong enough.... The Mango with Pomelo & Sago was very authentic
5
A friend of mine had taken me to this dessert wonderland. For 3$ you can order from snowden (shaved icecreams) to walnut/almond/peanut paste which I did not try. There is a great mango option that comes with sago and mango cubes. My friend loved it. Its a lovely place with character and great service.
4
Price for a bowl of dessert starts from $3. Place is really crowded but there are plenty of seats as the outlet is big. Ordered walnut and sesame hot dessert and both are good. Service is fast as there are plenty of staff here. Worth a try if you are in china town.
5
Simple variety and they carry their farmers' brand peanuts that they sell in packets or in pastries. Another branch in Ion Orchard
5
I first went to this place about 16 years ago and it's always a treat. Not much has changed over the years - the desserts are still terrific, they still sell peanuts from Taiwan, the prices don't seemed to have gone up much and the plastic chairs remain. But the headlines "acts" are the desserts. Today it was Mango with Pomelo Sago. I was also tempted to have the Durian Ice Mountain but I'll leave that for another time. Love this place
4
Had afternoon snack there. Ordered the rice dumpling and steamed milk. The dumpling was huge and delicious with the Chili sauce. The steamed milk was just like those yummy ones in Hong Kong. Too full to have the shaved ice dessert. But will definitely go back for the shaved ice dessert.
4
I always visit the outlet when i pop by chinatown.the glutinous rice ball are soft and chewy...ginger soup not too strong..but my facourite is the peanut paste...taste not too sweet suitable for everyone.especially in such cooling place it is a good time to try the hot dessert
5
If you have kids definitely come here, if you don't still give it a try. The snow ice is delicious and it has the basic flavours such as chocolate and strawberry as well as some Asian flavours for the adventurous. At $5 a dish it easily serves two people, on our first visit we shared between 2 adults and 2 kids quite well. This is a very popular shop that is always busy, we were lucky to find a table on a weekday before and after lunch, we thought service was great but a little bit of patience will help
5
Eating here is a must and it's worth coming to China town especially. It's only a short walk from the MRT. The food is wonderful, the staff are friendly and its well air conditioned. Their shave ice is very different from the common ais kacang. It's also very cheap
5
I was in the mood for something local. The place packed with mainly locals so I wanted to try it. I have had shaved ice before but until now I never understood how anyone considered it yummy. Now I know! Loved it. Will come back every time I am in Singapore

Mei Heong Yuen Dessert started as a small Chinese dessert outlet in CHINA TOWN area a few years ago. It now boasts as one of the best dessert outlets in SINGAPORE and have three (Temple Street, ION, China Town Point) outlets! The original desserts consist only cream of peanut or almond or sesame or walnut.....of these the peanut was the most popular. The peanut was roasted till fragrant and the aroma and taste is excellent. The scene was set, and Mei Heong Yuen becomes a MUST place for Chinese dessert in Singapore. They now have many other items apart from the traditional fares. The latest is a snow ice dessert which can par with all types of fruits. The machine was in the market years ago; and originated from Taiwan. However, many dessert sellers give the SNOW ICE machine a miss, till Mei Heong Yuen picks it up and make it "THE CHOICE"

I had a craving for good Cantonese desserts, specifically Almond Paste and Walnut Paste. I promptly headed to Temple Street in Chinatown for this shop. It has expanded over the years to occupy three ground floor units of 3 adjoining shop houses, due to good business.Dining here is good, as its air-conditioned and it’s a good respite from the heat when walking around Chinatown. They have also diversified in terms of dessert offerings to have cold desserts like ice shavings with mango, black sesame and green tea flavours. I was heading back for dinner and ordered several packets for my family:- Almond Paste: Smooth and creamy. This is good for ladies’ complexion and the ladies in my family finished this quickly. - Black Sesame Paste: I have ordered this before but this time, I found this a tad sweet for my liking. - Walnut Paste: Its smooth and you can consume this easily.All are good. Each costs $3. All the desserts are made on-premise and are fresh.Another dessert you can go for is the Peanut paste. Recommended

I will always have desserts here whenever I'm at Chinatown. It's always crowded but you don't have to wait very long for a seat. You'll have to order/ make payment at the cashier first. May not be the cheapest but they serve really good desserts. However I feel there's room for improvement for their black sesame paste.
4
They have a lot of hot and cold dessert choices, but the staff (as they are Aunties) and the cashier should be more patient and polite to us as some of people going there are tourists and we don't know the rules when order.
5
What a place to have amazing desserts.. The ice towers with mango, chocolate and all sorts of tastes. Mango and pomelo sago pudding has to be the best you can get anywhere.
Cool and fresh especially on a hot day in Singapore...that's every day.

Visited the outlet in Chinatown Point after having tried the hawker food in the Chinatown complex. Good selection of local desserts. Prices of course more expensive than main meals in the hawker centre, but better ambience and cleanliness. All quite tasty.
4
I am a huge fan of this dessert place. Their standard is always the same. I always finished a bowl of warm sesame dessert. We also love their ice sesame and almond dessert. A very acquired taste for non-locals but worth to try. It just melts in your mouth as the ice is as fine as snow.
4
If you plan to have a Chinese dessert, then you have come to the right place.One visit is not enough as there are a lot of desserts (hot and cold) to choose from.The taste is OK and the ambience is good.Prices are a little higher compared to hawker centres, but it doesn't matter once you get to taste their desserts
4
Try the chendol, it is different compare to all other chendols.you can buy.. At $6/- it is a little pricey but it is unique . You feel,as if you are eating flavoured snow . A must try if you like chendol.. 63-67 Temple street in Chinatown
5
This well known Chinese dessert place has since expanded to 3 shoplots in size but still very crowded when we arrived at 9pm. I had the soursop ice shawing which was lovely..... the ice shaving was very fine in texture. There is a wide range of dessert to choose from and I could easy have chosen 2 to 3 more! Soursop portion was rather generous too. The place though crowded was airy and comfortable. Must try!!!
4
Their snow ice desserts are one of the best in Singapore. The price for something this good is worth it. However, their lychee-flavoured desserts can be improved as some of the ingredients tasted sour at the times I was there. Their watermelon snow ice had enough taste of the fruit itself but yet not too strong for eating pleasure. Several other items they had could be priced slightly lower as it was too pricey for some of those items offered
4
My family/my friends and I visit this outlet frequently. I don't eat durian but was told, that the durian snow ice is yummy. I usually go for the ching theng (which is not spectacular given the price) or the mango snow ice. The mango snow ice with chucks of fresh mango is heavenly! It has grown from one shop unit to 3 over the years. I had the mango pomelo yesterday ... yummy. The desserts are not cheap
5
This was my first experience of eating a special desert, the Snow Ice. It was presented a perfect tree shaped desert with nice flavour. I found it very tasty and refreshing. It was nice combination of an ice tree and chunks of fresh mango. Must try while in Singapor
4
Well the ice cream is big and taste really good. For 5 singapore dollars I think it's worth to give it a try !
4
Nothing beats sitting in an air conditioned shop having delicious shaved ice. Price is reasonable at about $6 per bowl for sharing between 2 people. Lots of seats and turn over rate is high so good.

I have heard that this was a reputable dessert spot in Chinatown, so after a not-so-pleasant dinner at Chinatown my dad suggested we go to this place. It was still early, around 6pm, so there were not many people in the place. The room is very run-down and undecorated, scantly cooled by some ceiling fans, but somehow it helped add to the traditional "hawker center" ambiance of the place; in Singapore, it is an indication the restaurant has not succumbed to omnipresent modernization and still retains its authentic character. I ordered a green tea shaved ice dessert while my dad ordered a hot dessert (possibly a peanut soup?). To put it simply, I have tasted better at a generic hawker center. I may be an outlier, but I generally prefer a coarser, lighter ice dessert with a "crunch" to it and less cream and sweeteners. This shaved ice was almost ice cream: it was the consistency of snow, then doused in milk, cream, sugar,and green tea flavor. I would have liked more of the red bean paste and less of the rich, sickening shaved ice; I did not finish it, and usually I finish anything on my plate unless I really can't stand it. This was a short but memorable visit: the location and environment is rustic and pleasant, but the food itself should be scaled down in portion sizes
4
That's the name of this restaurant as I remember it , and I think it is the name visible on the board. It just about sums it up. I was born In Singapore and here I get all the desserts I grew up enjoying. It is a nostalgia trip, pure and simple. A no frills place in Chinatown, which fortunately retains much of its ambience. After wandering around in heat and humidity, it's a relief to come in here and order a shaved ice dessert. i generally go for chendol or durian, being a dyed in the wool Singaporean, but the less adventurous could stick to watermelon, lychee and mango. My other favourites are again probably not to every body's tastes but I go particularly for the most traditional specialities like cheng tng (a chilled sweet "soup"), black herbal jelly and birds nest. All guaranteed to cool you down inside and out
5
Every time I visit Singapore, I try to visit this shop in the heart of Chinatown. Within easy walk from MRT station (Google maps location is wrong, btw), turn right at first intersection when leaving subway and follow straight until you see it. My personal favorite is sesame paste ( black or white ), very tasty and cheap. Ice cream is also worth trying. This place is almost always very busy (locals and tourists alike) so this the best indication of how good it is.
4
This is my go-to place for Chinese desserts - I like their walnut cream, black sesame cream and the steam milk pudding. If you prefer cold dessert, try their mango shaved ice. It tastes like cotton candy :) A worthy try is their dumplings - ask for the icing sugar to dip into, it's odd and the only place which I know that serves it this way, but hey - it's addictive and I like it!They have another branch at Ion Orchard Basement 4, if you are not headed to their main branch in Chinatown
4
Visited the shop for many years, desserts are very nice. Met a newly married Japanese couple sharing the same table as seats are limited in the shop, the shop was recommended in Japan travel book. Let the young couple tried the desserts that my family members ordered and they liked all the desserts. Price are gone up a bit, but a good place to try the Singapore desserts

At Chinatown, after visiting Buddha Tooth Relic Temple and Ci Yan Organic Vegetarian Health Food, we visited this Ice Cream parlor. It was packed, though we could get a table as we reached. We ordered for only 2 ice creams (for 4 of us) and we just could not finish, as the ice creams were 'huge'. We were surprised at the other boys & girls who each were having a separate Ice Cream !!. It was much Icey (I think no milk), though we enjoyed having it. It was new and also reasonably priced. It like something that you remember even after years you have visited it. Have a look at their website. Interesting website like their Ice Creams. Go to the "Our Menu" to look at different Ice Creams and other eats. http://www.meiheongyuendessert.com.sg/Address. Mei Heong Yuen Dessert 味香园甜品, No. 63 - 67 Temple Street 63-67 号 牛车水登婆街

My Singaporean wife took me here, and while her choice would of course be the durian shaved ice dessert, I chose the lime. The texture of the ice is really astounding; it is shaved, not ground like we have here in the U.S. with sno-cones.It appears that they really use fruit juice, not syrup.Once you are here, you might as well stroll around Chinatown. I believe that the Chinatown MRT stop is the closest
4
I had the watermelon & lychee shaved ice while walking around Chinatown. It was not overly sweet to my taste and everything was so fresh! It just melts in your mouth right away! It's really worth a try but the portion is more suitable for sharing between 2-3 people
5
There are many choices of the traditional dessert there. Highly recommend for Mango roll and Mango Snowice. It is the best to have during the hot day.
4
After walking through the heart of China Town in Singapore, we stopped by for dessert. We ordered Snow ice consisting of Mango, Green tea and sesame. Added a bowl of hot sesame. Was authentic and nice but a bit too pricey @ SG$3 each.
4
The dessert house is located at Chinatown, which is opposite the Mc Donald. We'd tried the walnut paste, egg pudding with ginger, glutinous rice, and mango snow ice. i personnelly love the egg pudding which is very smooth as it melt in your mouth.
4
Like Good snowballs & peanut dessert & many more but stomach cannot eat so much at a time
Dislike: black sesame dessert
4
This place is most famous for their Peanut Paste, which is a traditional chinese dessert but those who are of non-Chinese background may not be accustomed to it. Their snow ice desserts are good too, especially if you need to cool off on a hot and humid day. Also love their glutinous rice with chicken, and the 3-colour cakes.For more details and photos, check out my blog post at http://jaznotabi.wordpress.com/mei-heong-yue

First, note that the most visible sign out front reads simply "Traditional Desserts." Most reviewers rave about the snow ice ($5), but I prefer the traditional Cantonese desserts served here, which are generally less expensive (mostly $2.50-3.00), offering not only good value but also extremely pure, distinct flavors. My favorite has to be the not-very-temptingly named "glutinous rice balls in ginger soup." This turns out to be a hot, very pure ginger broth with four balls of glutinous rice (Japanese "mochi") stuffed with peanut puree and black sesame puree. The mix of pure flavors of ginger, peanut and sesame is a sensory delight. I tried it one afternoon and was back later the same day for more. The family operating it began by producing peanuts and peanut paste and the flavors of all of their dishes are distinct, clear and refined. The only problem is that some of their dishes are more than one can eat...the sesame paste, for instance, is delicious but extremely filling. An order of yam cakes ($2.50) contains three substantial pieces. So it is a good idea to go in a group and share these various taste sensations. Be aware that you have to order at the counter, but service is fast and efficient
5
After visit chinatown with hot weather and tired. Come to this place to eat ice cream.This is traditional ice cream really nice and soft. When I talk to waiters this resto, what favorite ice cream. She said all flavor is favorite. Okay and I choose watermelon & Lychee ice cream and Manggo sago ice cream.Watermelon & Lychee ice cream when I eat this ice cream uwaaaw really really good taste. And I want thia ice cream again
4
You will yearn to go to this place on a hot day. The snow ice is big enough to be shared by 2 and the "snow" is silky smooth. This places seems to be a draw for young tourists , especially from Asia.But on a crowded day, the members of the staff show signs of "strains" by being snappy and "black faced"It is good for a small lunch - of "chee cheong fun" and the 3 types of steamed cakes viz, yam, pumpkin and white radis
4
With a large variety of desserts and shaved ice, we had the mango rolls, durian shaved ice, watermelon shaved ice, the stuffed tang yuen and the green bean soup. I personally like the green bean. Well cooked and just the right flavour. Overall it was great with no complaints
3
Easy to find location. There seemed to be about 3 entrances but make sure you enter through the last door on Temple St. Find a table, reserve it, get in line, order, and wait at your table. Each of the snow ice or at least the one I ordered was SG$5, which I thought was fairly priced compared to US prices. I ordered the green tea snow ice. It took a lot longer than it should have and when I did get my order, the ice was melting too quickly. I took a picture of it as soon as I got it and you can see it melting. The snow was soft, fluffy, and melted in my mouth. The only included topping you get is red bean with this one. Although it was a nice cool dessert, the only thing really missing was the condensed milk. That would've topped off this cool dessert nicely. 25% through, I felt like the dessert was getting too dry. I would still come back and want to try all the other recommended dessert. I had two lunches and could not eat more
4
Tried the mango pudding and it was delicious. Unique tasting slightly sour and sweet with the Pamelo sago added.
My colleagues said that the snow ice servings can feed up to 2 peeps so will be back here to try the next time.
4
Been there few times and it still in the list whenever we go to chinatown area. Desserts was served very fast, short waiting time. Desserts always well presented with it "beautiful" way. Really like the taste. Must try!
4
I always go back here whenever I'm visiting Singapore. I usually go to the ION outlet and usually it's crowded, people are waiting to have their seats. Just go for the recommended section, the ice and sago are rich in taste, it is one dessert to satisfy you & cool you down in Singapore's warm weather
4
Big crowded place full of locals. I ordered the Chendol shaved ice cream and it was really delicious. I got a big mountain of coconut shaved ice cream with red beans, black and white jelly cubes and something green that had no taste but looked great. I am not a big sweet tooth, but this ice cream wasn't sweet at all. You can make it sweeter by adding syrup, but for me there was no need. It was a great experience and I hope to come back again
5
Big portion, nicely shaped and colorful the first thing in my mind after I see it. The taste is nice with option of 2 flavour combination. The unique ones and many people didn't notice, there are some sort of small jelly balls wrapping liquid syrup, so when you bite it, the ball explode leaving wet sweet sensation inside mouth. I think the jelly balls made with recently popular technique science cooking: molecular gastronomy
4
Just one block away from the touristy spot of China town~ uniquely Singaporean and a must try to cool down your core after walking around in the sweltering heat. Those who are not familiar to the combinations of flavors, will be pleasantly surprised. Unlike a lot of Asian desserts, the snow ice dessert we tried were not overly sweeten and refreshing. We tried the Chendol, chocolate, and Green Tea Snow Ice. The Chendol is coconut flavor with red bean and gelatin cubes, and with the option to add palm sugar syrup on top. Got to try the other flavors next time

Mei Heong Yuen offers a large variety of desserts. We visited this place after a spicy Sichuan meal at Si Wei Mao Cai, which is nearby, looking to appease our burning palates and we were not disappointed.Food Mei Heong Yuen’s menu is extensive. There is an amazing variety of cold desserts to choose from. Since I’d heard about the delicious shaved ice desserts served here, that is what I stuck to. I had the lychee ‘snow ice’ and loved it. The ice was soft, but not runny; filled with lychee flavour, but not overly sweet and garnished with some of the real fruit too. Simple but tasty. Service & StaffThe service was brisk. We were served our dessert within minutes. The staff was polite and very efficient. Ambiance & LocationThe place has a very simple setting but is clean and tidy. No fancy frills and fittings. Definitely not for those looking for exotic desserts in a fine-dining-type luxury setting! Mei Heony Yuen is a nondescript place on Temple Street and could be easy to miss if you aren't with a local or unfamiliar with China Town in general. Value for MoneyThe simple, tasty desserts are light on the wallet. At S$5, you couldn't ask for better bang for your buck – delicious, hygienic and healthy desserts.Tips for DinersThis isn't for those looking for exotic, creamy, chocolate-y desserts in a fancy setting. The place can get very busy at night, post dinner time, so be prepared for a crowd. Try the lychee snow ice. Chocolate lovers could be disappointed.Overall ImpressionDefinitely a place I would stop at again after a spicy dinner. The sheer creativity on their snow ice menu is worth exploring. Healthy desserts that are light on the pocket – what’s not to love
3
The place was quite packed when we arrived at 9+pm, pretty close to closing time (at 10pm), but we managed to get a seat. Menu was quite extensive with a wide selection of hot & cold desserts, especially of the 'snow ice' variety, but I wouldn't say that they are local Singaporean desserts per se as same or similar desserts can be found all around East Asia.Portions are regular, prices are OK, taste is fine (tho' not spectacular), service is quick, decor is simple, place is air-conditioned & clean - makes for a good stop to take a break, cool off & feed your craving for something sweet if you're in Chinatown. Personally, I may drop by again if I happen to be in the area, but I don't think I'd deliberately make a trip to Chinatown just to come here
5
This place located at Temple Street, Chinatown is the residence of the best desserts in Singapore. Must try is the black sesame almond snow ice. The strawberry mango shaved ice is also delicious but is best shared with someone because the serving is good enough for two though they offer it solo. To top it all, mango roll is a sweet treat to finish a meal. Absolutely a must visit if you want to sample traditional and heritage sweet course
4
A haven for dessert lovers, this famous shop has expanded over the years. It's almost at full occupancy whenever meal time rolls around. Not all their desserts are fantastic, but most of them are really good. The shaved ice is a must try, especially on a hot, sweltering day. My personal favourite is the peppermint Gui Ling Guo, which is a herbal jelly that cools you from the inside. Beware though, the servings are pretty large and it's wise to share if you're a small eater

We visited the famous dessert shop called Mei Heong Yuen Dessert, which is part of the Chinatown Heritage trail, for shaved ice desserts. Unfortunately, we didn't care much for either dessert type we tried. First, we sampled the Mango Ice dessert (SG$5) that was a shaved ice with the flavour of lychee, not mango. This was a shame as neither of us care for lychee that much and we were both confused by the shaved ice choice, feeling that it didn't mix particularly well with the mango topping (rating 2 or 5). We would have preferred that they had used mango (or milk) flavoured ice for this dessert. We also tried the Almond paste (SG$3) that wasn't bad, tasted like a Chinese tea we drink at home but very thick. Not a great dessert choice but something we were intrigued to try (rating 2.5 of 5). Unfortunately, our visit here was not particularly successful and less enjoyed than others tried during this trip in both Singapore and Melaka. We'll probably try something different next time
5
I was craving for a good nice Chendol and happen to stumble upon this little shop at ION.I've never tried Chendol served from Shaved Ice before much different from the Chendol that I used to have.Truly enjoy it to the last bit and I did come back again to try another one of her shaved ice...
5
So glad that I discovered this place when walking around Chinatown. The restaurant is very close to Chinatown MRT exit A so it shouldn't be hard to find. I really wanted to try the shaved ice but it looked a bit too big for one person. I ended up having the mango pomelo and the coconut pudding. The mango pomelo was so refreshing after walking in the Singapore heat for a whole day. I had many versions of this same dessert before in different Asian countries, but this was by far the best version I have had. If you are having dinner around Chinatown area, be sure to leave some room to have dessert here
5
Mei Heong Yuen Dessert in situated along Temple Street in Chinatown. You can find it easily once you exit from Exit A (Temple Street) Chinatown MRT station. It's just behind the McDonalds outlet.This outlet which serves traditional desserts occupy 3 shophouses, and this itself speaks volume about the reputation of the desserts. This is the 4th day that my family and I are in Singapore and we have been patronizing this outlet everyday. Do expect a crowd on any time of the day.Looking at the menu itself is mind boggling. If opportunity (and your stomach!) permit, do try out the shaved ice, Cantonese dumpling, peanut cream, black sesame cream, walnut cream. They are all truly yummy
5
My dining companion is a long time customer and had been waiting for me to visit Singapore again to try the dishes. Her recommendation was the Durian dessert - it was just the best.I can't wait to go again on my next visit to Singapore for another choice... the iced cendol might be in peril... The shop is in Chinatown and has a hustle & bustle atmosphere and on busy days the locals happily wait for a seat
5
This shop has expanded in floor area (taken up an adjacent unit) and undergone quite abit of renovation recently. I could feel that the aircon airflow was strong and the wait for a table was not as long as before. There used to be several dessert shops in the vicinity but this is the only one that is still standing and doing brisk business. Not surprising, given the taste and quality of the desserts sold here.The traditional warm desserts (peanut, black sesame, walnut, almond creams), mango pomelo, shaved ice are popular items. I like them all and gave me problems what to choose whenever I had to order. You can't get better ones elsewhere. Just observe, locals (Singaporeans) are vying with us tourists to get a table in the shop. Needless for me to say further
5
omg!! i have been a chendul lover ever since i was born some 49yrs ago and this dessert place gave me such a heart attack of goodness!!! its located in chinatown off the mrt train station, and if ever anyone needs dessert, this is one of the places!! their shaved iced dessert are to die for!
4
A definite must-visit dessert eatery when in Chinatown, Singapore. Located along Temple Street, just off the main road. Constant stream of diners coming for its wide range of sweet cold & hot delights. Getting a table may be a challenge especially during peak hours and hot days. But the diners don't normally take too long a time and securing a table should be expected within 10-15min. Service is brisk but don't expect 5 stars. Just order, pay in cash, and the orders should come in good time. Star items include the iced mango dessert, mango with pomelo and sago,.... Eat with friends and family for an even better taste. It's a happy food after all. ^___
3
We went for dessert as the reviews on trip advisor said it was good, my hubby had mango pomelo which was a block of ice which didn't taste of much and I had pumkin cake which didn't taste of much either. The service was good tho, but probably wouldn't go agai
4
A no-frills but clean shophouse in the heart of Chinatown serving traditional hot and chilled Chinese desserts and substantial snacks like pumpkin and yam rice cakes as well as a big fellow of a glutinous rice dumpling with fillings of a mixture of pork, chestnut, mushrooms and salted egg yoke.My recommendations of must-haves: 1. Green-tea and red bean snow-ice dessert: This is an extremely fine shaved ice of genuine green-tea flavor top with well-stewed red beans. Very refreshing and tasty.2. Chendol snow-ice dessert: Extremely fine and smooth shaved ice from ice made withcoconut milk topped with an assortments of other ingredients and served with a squeeze bottle of fine quality gula melaka(palm sugar) syrup for you to dribble as much as you want over the snow-ice. This is definitely a not-to-be-missed cold dessert for people who enjoy Chendol, coconut and gula melaka
