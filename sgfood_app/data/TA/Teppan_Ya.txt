Food was okay - not great, not bad. That said, this place is expensive, even for Singapore.
Service was also slow, especially considering that the restaurant was practically empty.

This restaurant is on the 4th floor of the Mandarin Oriental hotel but accessible to the public. It's pricey but the Japanese food is excellent. There is a choice of Teppan Yaki or a la carte featuring flavours of Japan.

I had dinner at Teppan-Ya. The food was relatively simple but it was very tasty. The service was friendly and very efficient. The prices are on the high side.

A group business dinner with an amazing view out over marina bay to the CBD. The food was served in a completely unobtrusive way - perfect for business but the quailty was superb.

We arrived at the hotel late evening and because we were staying for just the one night we decided to eat here rather than venture out. The service was polite but a bit on the formal side. The food was OK but not worth the price. The selection for vegetarians was disappointing (not much choice). I didn't like the noodle dish I chose at all - my husband ended up eating it. I left the restaurant feeling rather hungry.The price of the wine was extortionate - we paid the equivalent of £70 for a bottle of cheap Chilean Sauvignon Blanc. To add insult to injury - the restaurant was closing and the staff made it clear that they were stopping serving - however, they hadn't given us the rest of our wine - to make sure we got it we had to get up from the table to fetch it ourselves. There was a good half a glass left - which at £70 a bottle we were determined to have. Overall, overpriced with average food, poor vegetarian selection, mediocre service and extortionate wine prices. Best thing about it are the views towards the Fullerton Bay Hotel

Had a superb evening at this Japanese restaurant. Upon arrival I was quite sceptical because it was quiet and also very hot due to the hot plates for cooking. However 20 minutes or so in after we had placed our order with the very attentive staff Stanley the chef arrived. Stanley was a true professional very informative explaining the source of all the food what he was cooking it in and then delivering fantastic food whilst putting on a great cooking spectacle.Well done all fantastic evening

Went here for a special celebration meal. Apart from excellent food quality - which gave a great deal, I was absolutely stunned to sit and watch the chef in action. This is like a show in itself. It was an amazing experience and a privilege to see this cooking

We were mightily impressed by this restaurant. The quality of the ingredients was just superb - standouts being "Kumi's number one" special (an amazing crab gratin), the wagyu beef, and the baked oysters. Yes it was expensive but worth every penny in my book. It was a memorable meal

I had a first lunch here just off the plane, too tired to think clearly. I ordered a sushi bento box and water no ice. In California this would be $20, tops. In the middle of a multi-country business trip, I hadn't yet worked out currency conversion in Singapore dollars. SGD$80? what does that mean? In Bali, 100,000 rupiahs are just over $7.00. Turns out that means $68 in US dollars. Whoops. Pretty sure that's over the business expense limit!Service was curt and average. Food was good and plentiful, but nothing that special. I would not return to this restaurant and had much better experiences elsewhere in the hotel

Overall the food, particularly the beef, foie gras and appetizer was nicely done; as was the showmanship and hospitality showed by our chef for the evening, David, although the seafood left much to be desired. Appetizer was very delicious, crabmeat with Japanese mayo, avocado and fried oyster, a nice selection of savory and salty. Sashimi was of very good quality, particularly the otoro, which had the marbling that rivaled those of wagyu cuts.The foie gras was done especially well. The teriyaki sauce was mild, unlike the usual teriyaki used. Although the chef highlighted that it was duck and not goose liver (due to humanitarian reasons) which resulted in a thicker slice, he still managed to maintain a crisp outer layer while maintaining a cooked gooey center. This balance is indeed quite rare to see and was a pleasant reminder of what good foie gras should taste like (the last time I thoroughly enjoyed such foie gras was in Matsugawa at the now defunct Pine Tree Club at Stevens road).The seafood selection was overall unsatisfactory. The scallop and salmon felt overcooked and overly chewy while the cuttlefish was ordinary and bland. The salmon skin that was fried separately was however, a nice touch. The beef was decent. We had a US angus tenderloin and Japanese Wagyu from the Hida region, a first for me. The US beef was tender and juicy but not particularly tasty. The wagyu however, was an entirely different story. The flavor was there from the first bite and my mouth was quickly filled with the buttery flavor of the Wagyu. I requested to have mine lightly salted to further enhance the flavor of the beef. This particular cut of wagyu was pleasant to binge on as it wasn't too oily, unlike some Kobe/Wagyu cuts that I have tried in the past. In addition, the zucchini and mushroom weren't just for decor, but was a sweet and juicy accompaniment between bites of beef. We ended with garlic fried rice, infused with fat from the wagyu we had eaten. At first taste, it seemed like it too, lacked salt. However, letting it sit in my mouth and allowing the flavors to express itself, I began to appreciate the subtle flavors emanating from the fat, garlic and egg. I ended the meal with matcha ice cream, which was satisfactory.It was overall, an enjoyable experience although David seemed minimalistic with the sauces he used in his food. This was unlike other teppanyaki chefs I have tried in the past. This would have been more successful had the food been of better quality, which apart from the beef and foie gras, was not the case. I would recommend this to people that love an entertaining dinner, while preferring their teppanyaki cooked without the rich sauces usually accompanied by it.
