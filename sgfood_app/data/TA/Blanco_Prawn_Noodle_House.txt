Have been patronising this restaurant for many years, as usual on weekends ia crowded and parking is a problem. But still we cannot resist the nice soup base and the fresh prawns. They also have ngoh Hiang(deep fried snacks platters) and you may order some to snack first before the prawn noodle comes.Although isbalways crowded, the food come very fast, and staffs attitude are good.Not a bad choice if you want to eat a bowl of prawn noodle with nice prawn soup base. Price wise, starting with cheapest S$5.80 per bowl, is about the same compared to another famous prawn noodle in Macpherson. But the portion not very big, one with big appetite can order a medium size or even larger size portion.
