Good experience with the movie comfort. Comfortable reclining seat with blankets provided. We had lunch in there before movie started. Food was good everything is perfect.

The service at the golden village cinema, in suntec city mall, was 5 star all the way. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The food was also very good

Movies?? Only Gold Class for me. Pretty decent food all the while during previous movie sessions so decided to walk in this evening for late dinner/supper, after being snubbed by a more expensive place. Casual place and not expecting much. Full glass wine 25% off and 10% off food for members... nice Grilled fish that my wife order came out cold in the center, gave our feedback to, duty manager and she brought it back to kitchen promptly. Was expecting just a reheat but she gave us a new portion instead. Nice gesture and the fish came out nice and hot, albeit a little too hot with gravy almost dried, for good measures I guess, But the fish tasted not too bad. Waffles and ice cream for dessert. Waffles average tasting but ice cream came out cold and nice like it should be. Youâ€™ll be surprised how this is overlooked in many places.Good service very hard to come by in SG these days so am more appreciative I guess

The Gold Class experience is very much like the experience of business class of Singapore Airline. Very cozy chair and wonderful food menu. It costs you twice/triple the price of usual movie ticket.The experience could be further improved if the theater supports 3D or IMAX

Truly good first movie experience at Golden Village's Gold Class, its premiere concierge-style theater brand. I've been to similar VIP cinemas with reclining single sofas and butler-style service. But what makes Gold Class stand out are:- only 24 seats in the entire cinema for that personalized ambience and service- better reclining sofas with supple leather and full reclining capability- wider menu items with more varied choices (menu is even self-lighted, not necessary for the waiter to hold a flashlight over your head)- larger and more luxurious holding area for guests before the movie startsOne advantage of GC's competition though is privacy, due to the partition wall which separates you from the neighboring seats. Gold Class seating layout is spacious but privacy can be improved. Also, blankets are not served individually to each moviegoer. I recommend you to come in the cinema 30 minutes earlier so that you can select your food without feeling rushed. Good choices are the grilled chicken sandwich with truffle fries (huge sandwich!), and lychee rose iced tea. Try getting a full glass of merlot for that relaxing feeling as you enjoy your movie. Be prepared to spend though as GV Gold Class (@39SGD) is 50% more expensive than competing brands. But of course, quality comes with a price.

I have been watch movie at Shaw premiere several times, ticket price is about $25++ about 16 seats in a hall but shaw entire service level is excellent compare to gold class gv which cost $39++ per ticket. When you walk into Shaw premier lounge you feel warm welcome , gold class the service crew just bring the menu to you and brought you to the seat and they are kinda of 'quiet' and group at the corner. I went to the toilet, I was shocked, the top of dustbin full of tissue and no one clean it. But good thing the tissue made by bamboo material which is environmentally friendly. When movie about to start , there is no bring you to the seat,You need to go to search the seat by your own. Overall the service is average. If you wanna experience cosy, comfortable with quality service, gold class might not be your first choice

We popped in here, as my cousin recommended it. Have tried similar things in the UK, but it has to be said, Singapore do this pretty well. And the value really isn't bad either, at $29 a ticket; it's not much more than a regular cinema ticket. The service is good and the food is tasty (quite small portions). The seats are really comfy, and the quality of the screen and sound is top notch. Great experience

Ultra comfortable fully recline seat with blanket provided. Great for couples & blockbuster movie. Came here on corporate package so we had the whole theatre to ourselves fitting 24 pax, inclusive of the food - popcorn, drinks (juices & sparkling wines), main course & chocolate cake. Food is just average but I am glad the company is footing the bill

If you do not like to be disturbed with crowds in the cinema and also having to deal with unwanted noise and crampy space in the cinema while you are watching some real good block busters then the Gold Class is for you. Before you enter the cinema, you can chill out at the lounge area with selections of bar drinks and also some food. The Gold Class Cinemas are spacious not more than 20 people in a cinema. There are also blankets, adjustable seats for you to enjoy your show. Although the price is not cheap, but a little indulgence is good for you sometimes

Its not the regular cinematic experience. Imagine Business Class on a plane.$39 per person and highly recommended to impress a date or to pamper yourself.Improved Menu selections of food & beverage. Didnt like the idea of full course meal in a dark cinema setting . But bites/ soups and desserts are great! Alcoholic and Non Alcoholic selections available. All these served to you at your comfy nappa leather full reclinable sofa and a nice decent blanket.No more crowds... No more queues and seriously who wouldnt like to be pampered
