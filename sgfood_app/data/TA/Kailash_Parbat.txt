This is a brand in India so taste was never gonna be a problem , but sorry guys your outlet at Colaba still rocks the best ... n highly priced ... though enjoyed the food
4
Really liked the food and ambience. Good indian taste, pure veg food. Fast service. Slightly overpriced but ok.
4
Clean and good taste Indian veg restaurant. No meat dishes at all. Indian sweets are also quite good.
3
It is a well known restaurant so when we saw it in Singapore last year, we were really excited.The place is clean with good ambience.We ordered a very light meal but it turned out to be an oily mess.I kind of felt sick after eating it and started throwing up. I had to take medicine and our plans for that day were ruined.We were highly disappointed.We visited singapore last month as well but gave this restaurant a miss.
4
The food is good but some items are too spicy , also the AC is not very effective, Oh yes the seating chairs are fixed to the floor so does not make the entire eating thing comfortable.Their menu is good and preparations are also good , service is fast 
4
We went for lunch to celebrate my grand daughter's birthday. Being 10 persons, they gave us a semi private dining room. Very good ambience. This is the largest 2 or 3 other smaller properties (all in Little India). Very helpful and courteous staff with good suggestions. They even took good care of the little one. They tasty snacks like dahi bhalla, papdi chat, bhel, samosa etc. Lunch items were ordered a-la-carte. Excellent tasty food. Vegetarian Sindhi specialities also available. Value for money
5
One of the best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.They have excellent food, excellent service with warm welcoming staff. In our 20 days stay in Singapore we ate at this restaurant for 10 days. Their Kaju masala curry, grilled sandwiches and malai kulfi were the best ones we ever had
4
We went there for dinner primarily because or go-to restaurant urban roti (a few doors down) was closed that day for repairs. It was quite late in the evening (10pmish) but the service was good. Good vegetarian fare - especially the Chole Bhature. The dal makhani was also very good
4
We frequent this outlet next to the Temple in Little India and have realized that this place doesn't believe in consistency. At times their puris are stale and have a very strong stale oil aftertaste, at times the yoghurt in the dahi puri is too sour, at times their chole is bland missing the basic spices and seasonings, at times the sandwiches are inedible. Their lunch/dinner menu tells the same story. Unreliable. But the last time we were there, we were in for a treat! the pani puri puris weren't stale, chole was delicious and the paneer tikka sandwich was excellent. Everything was yummy and delicious. In fact we even told the lady who took our order about the good food and the previous letdowns. All the best
5
We visited Kailash Parbat for a family dinner during our vacation to Singapore. We went there primarily as it was a vegetarian restaurant. The ambience is just about good and located in Little India were competing options are available. We had kids and ordered for Paneer kofta, roti, dal and jeera rice. The kofta was excellent and the tandoori roti was just about perfect. The service was superfast. A little pricey, but worth the wonderful experience and taste, expect about 25SGD per person at least.
5
I went there for lunch with family. We had chola bhatura, paneer butter masala and tandoori roti. Paneer was so yummy. Will surely visit again.
5
In Singapore wheneber you crave for indian food, your destination should be Kailash Parbat.
Situated in heart of Little India, this place is heaven for food lovers.
4
Very good selection of menu and the food is really good. Its definitely a dependable place to go for lunch or dinner especially after a long tiring day. Definitely its very pricey but the service is really good.
5
The restaurant is quite easy to locate from Little India MRT station. Really delicious and will come back soon to try other dishes.
5
one f d best restaurant in little india...nice ambience...v had chole bhature ,parathas n vada pav....al were good...vl definetly recommend all indians to visit dis resto
4
It was awesome experience to eat indian veg food in singapore.Went for dinner and had pani poori, bhel poori chaat items. Also naans and paneer butter masala, very tasty and fast efficient service.Very nice ambience,best chaat restuarant in Singapore.
2
If you can, avoid it. I had two chats - bhel puri and dahi puri. Both were bad and felt kinda sick. I would not go. The problem is that part of little India has very few good restaurants.
4
we had a lunch @ kailash,with family,the environment looks great.important thing the food lunch was awesome much tastier than my expectation .Good choice for indian Food.
4
We have been dining at Kailash Parbhat, opposite Mustafa centre regularly. One thing we have noticed is that quality and taste only gets better every time.Our favorite there are - Lemon coriander soup, panneer tika (starter), Veg chilli milli and ofcourse lip smacking chats. Highly recommend this place for residents and visitors alike, though the price may be bit on the higher side
1
This used to be a good restaurant, however of late its fallen into decline. The waiting staff don't really seem to understand how food is to be served, for example if a soup and a naan bread are the only thing that is ordered by a customer. Then bring them together.. Not bring the soup first and then leave the customer with just a naan to eat.. Such nuances are not understood.I suppose this is a rather big ask from a restaurant that claims to have a worldwide presence.The food served is unhealthy and excessively oily and over priced,.several hawker centers dish out better options in Singapore
5
Excellent choice of chat items, so much of variety. My fav is Pav Bhaji. But it is mostly crowded due to Mustafa proximity. But they make tasty food. Some items can be really spicy - check before ordering !
4
One of the few North Indian veg food places in Little India. It is next to Kali temple on Serangoon Road.
Must Eats: Chaat and Naan sets
5
Rest assured, always get Indian Vegetarian food with awesome staff who are eager to help. Dal Makhani is best we get here, in Singapore.
3
Kailash Parbat is authentic and Keeping good Indian food. Its was really enjoyed to ate Indian veg food. I like very much Cutlet and Pav Bhali its was so Delicious.
4
Ambience of the restaurant is good ,and staff is also nice with quick service. I have tried there samosa chats and pannipuri both was good. Excellent Quality of food- Excellent Service- Excellent Value for money.Highly Recommended ,,,,
5
The place looks deserted from some distance but when we went inside, it was full of people.
Very nice staff and food tasted awesome. Pani puri, samosa chat was amazing. We went there again the next day to have it again.
5
Very good restaurant esp for North Indian quick food bites. Exactly opposite Mustafa centre which adds to your convenience.
4
I had a Sev Puri and a cold coffee. The taste for the sev Puri was quite good and the cold coffee was also refreshing.
I only thought that the pricing was a bit too much for what they are serving in Kailash Parbat.
4
This branch of Kailash Parbat just opposite to the famous Mustafa Centre seems perennially crowded. It's also cramped , with tables in close proximity. If you brave these inconveniences...there's no further disappointment. In the group we tried Alu tikki chaat, dahi poori, veg noodles and the eternal favourite chole bhature. All the items were tasty, authentic and the rushing waiters attentive and quick. The chaas to wash down the spices and oil was comforting too. The tab was reasonable. A big tick for me...any time...and there is so much more to try too
4
Kaislah Parbat has always been good though we still dont know if it is the same Kailash Parbat of Mumbai .. The food was lovely . We tried Dal Makhani and different types of parathas , kadhi chawal .. service is nice and ambience also decen
4
Restaurant is clean and staff is courteous. The quality of food - Chats is good and of Mumbai Style. North Indian food (Punjabi style) is good. The quality of foods is more than expectation in a foreign country.
5
we had amazing Indian food ....we had Fried rice & Manchurian which was perfect Indian Taste ..we also had Punjabi which was superb too.....one can blindly order any thing i am sure you will get proper taste.
4
The kailash parbat at singapore is able to maintain quality similar to the one they provide in India. However service very very slow.
Overall good experience.
3
Just overrated and overpriced. Not that many choices in Singapore so people do go there- but nothing there is authentic enough for the price one pays.
5
Fine Dining @ night after a long day - Delicious food for value dining. Look for Chole Batoora with Pindi Chole
4
The food here is good, I would expect people to come here for North Indian cuisine.Food quality is good, options are aplenty & the head waiter is very courteous. We had food there about 3 times during our stay and the cost worked out to be approximately 50 SGD per couple (2 adults and 1 child) per meal. That is costly considering that we averaged 50 SGD for two couples per meal at just about every other place.Go there for a change and be ready to be left with just that in your pockets :
5
It was a solace to have found one of my favorite eateries in Singapore. It is conveniently located along the famous Little India - Belilios Road. We had the delicious Pav Bhaji, taste of which transported us to the famous khao-gallis of Mumbai. Recommendations - Pav Bhaji, Paneer Sabzi, Masala Dosa. I did have one concern, they do not provide fresh pickle tubs, they will simply pass over a pickle tub used from another table. Staff also need to wear smiles on their faces. When we placed our order the waiter was behaving as if he was doing us all a big favor. Please note that most of the food served here is not fresh, it's pre-prepared and continued
4
Visited here last week ( Nov 17) for lunch, reached around 3pm and found them to be closing soon. we had ordered Pao Bhaji and it was made with utmost perfection. We found it to be the best Pao bhaji we had outside of Mumbai or Pune. Quite a few other options in chats and indian fare. I'm sure one would not be dissappointed
4
A bit costlier. Alternate place if you are tired of South Indian food. Food was good. Had my first experience that waiter will not serve food unlike in India. Also the items you order will arrive at the same time. There will not be any time interval . they will place the order on the table and leave
4
We had KP Platter Chaat, Samosa Chaat and the best of all was Koki, we loved it very much and will recommend strongly for Koki (its a Sindhi item but excellent taste and I am quite sure every Indian will love it, it is served with a bowl of curd). I would definitely like to mention that the restaurant is little expensive as compared to its counterparts in the vicinity offering Indian food but still one should try it out at least once
5
Nice Indian food, amazing taste. Chole bhature is one of the best. Sweets are also good including rasmalai, faluda kulfi, rabri gulabjamun. Nice service. Little bit on higher side w.r.t price
3
Food is okay but it is not worth for it's price. Restaurant is very chaotic, had to call the waiter multiple time just to order the food !!!!
4
If you want to eat Indian vegetarian in Singapore just simply go in this restaurant. The best 100% vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.
4
Chole bhatura is their signature dish and worth a try. My favorite is paneer bhatura.
They offer variety of chats but I am not impressed with their chats, their chats are too sweet.
5
A good place for Indian vegetarian in little india and have another branch near Mustafa.It is good to have vegetarian food but make sure your reaches a bit early so that you don’t have wait for long.
Enjoy bon appetite
3
Good restaurant near to Hilton. The food and service quality was average but lots of choices are available. The ambience is good with many staff.
4
Good place to get good taste of indian chat, nothing much to say so best to head out to Kailash Parbat and experience the same.....
5
Every dish we ordered was made to perfection and fulfilled our tasteful desires completely. we feel bad to not be able to complete our meal course because everything was so good and we ordered a lot.... i recommend do not leave this restaurant without having their desert.. specially malai kulf
5
One of the best place in singapore where you get good tasty Indian Vegetarian food. This place is must go place for the whole family every month and we love each and every time we go here. The food is amazing. The quality and quantity is perfect and no regrets in paying the bill as your stomach is well taken care each visit. Kudos. Keep up the good work. Only one request from my side the Pani puri lacks the authenticity. Please work on it
2
Made the mistake of stopping by at this location. While the food is fine, I would recommend going to their other location on Serangoon Rd. Much better ambience and service. We always go there with friends. At the Syed Alwi outlet, they first gave me a table and then made me move because “the group wants this table.” Turns out they wanted to give my table to five tourists. Don’t think I will be going back to this location ever again.
5
Best one for indian vegetarian options. Chaat is awesome. Always crowded. Wait is worth. Pani Puri make you remember of mumbai. The food is best!!!
4
Great place for chat (Indian snacks) coupled with good service. my favorite is Samosa Chat. Little expensive than surrounding restaurents and worth the quality.
4
Visited on 19 Aug 17. The restaurant has good ambience. The Indian food was excellent and better than many upscale restaurants in India. The service was prompt and courteous.
5
An amazing indian food in singapore. Love the restaurant. Good and friendly staff. Very nice experience. Must Visit
5
Went to eat out at the restaurant with high expectations which were met easily ! Located in Littke India area, offers good authentic north indian food , suitable for family and friends outing. The ambience and environment is very good. Mushroom matar curry which is not on the menu is brilliant, highly recommended
3
I have been to Kailash Parbat a few times. So it means its not bad and you can repeat it, but then its also pretty std stuff and what you want you need to know.Their chole bhatura platter is very good. So are their chaats. But they are pretty pricey. This time I tried their north indian food and I came away unimpressed.We ordered Garlic nanns, which even when hot have a a rubbery texture. They definitely need to look at their flour preparation. We order shaahi paneer and it was white gravy based which is wrong, no issues, the gravy is fine, not great, but its the paneer that kills it. Its not at all soft. This is a shocker. There are many places in singapore that serve very soft paneer , why cant they get it. I am sure their own chefs would admit this is not the kind of paneer that works.On top of it their rates are significantly high. for these rates I woudl rather go to another restaurant that serves much better north indian cuisine. so its a ok and decent place if you know what to order. but nothing great about it
4
Kailash Parbat restaurant located at Little India is a good place if you are looking out pure vegetarian Indian food. Serves a very good variety of Chats . However the service needs a little improvement as it is a bit slow. Otherwise it was a overall good experienc
1
Have been couple of times to have chaats, which is Ok. One of the visits, ordered Fried Rice. It was too oily. So next visit I specifically asked for less oil in my rice. I was in for a shock, the most oiliest biryani I have ever had. Did point it out to the lady in charge, who defended it saying there was no extra oil added. We already had a tiring day, was in no mood to argue with someone who was not ready to correct. We just left the food , paid the bill and exited. The manchurian starter was over fried. Will never step in there again as they lack basic customer service
5
While cravings were lingering ard unsatisfied, chanced upon the restaurant while driving pass. Decided to drop in to have Pani Puri. To add on had few more items which were worth trying. Must try dishes will include Sev Puri n Dahi Puri (my fav). Even the drinks were gd, coffee had nice aroma n taste, tea was equally good and Lime Soda which was refreshing. A definitely "wanna go again" place
3
We went to KP, Little India, Singapore, as we were missing biriyani a lot! We arrived early to avoid waiting. We managed to slip in n get the last available table. The place was really narrow n linear, n cramped up, hesitantly rundown too.. It was extremely noisy, the place was definitely understaffed. The staff was running around, why n where is difficult to comment as public seated on each table was looking disgusted, unattended n disappointed. The food really arrived late, it was delivered to three of us at three different timelines. Food was good with KP standards, die to which I'm giving it 3 stars. Get in here only if you are looking for food 'on the go'. Avoid it completely if you're looking for fine dines or special evenings!
5
Most genuine veg snacks like papdi chat , paneer tikka, samosa , seekh kabab veg available . Main course is awesome too. Located just opposite to Mustafa complex gate 2. The place inside is little congested. Suggested them to offer wifi access to tourists.
5
For someone who enjoys pure vegetarian food this is the place! Bit expensive conpared to other Indian restaurant in Singapore but the food quality is awesome. Anyone who wants a pure vegetarian dinner can't afford to miss this place.
4
You will get very, very tasty food at Kailash Parbat - Syed Alwi outlet. Absolutely lip smacking. Veg Chilli Milli with Masala Kulcha, Chole Paneer Bhatura and gulab jamun with rabri are my all time favourites here.
5
The best indian food in little India. After a long tiring day; you crave for a good heavy meal and Kailash Parbat is a place to go. It gets little waiting during night but its worth. Chole bhatura, chats, pavbhaji, northindian everything is great.
5
One of the great option at Little India to have authentic Indian Food from North Indian Food to Chats etc... Need to wait being always crowded....
5
we visit kailash parbat at lest once a month. Good veg food. Paneer Makhani, pain puri, chinese dishes all very good and yum. value for money
5
We were craving for some Indian food and what we found was a gem. The taste was authentic Indian. Even the chaats were like Delhi Chaat! Service was very quick.
5
Best Taste !Good Service !A Vegetarian Delight !One of the best Restaurants in Singapore. Never miss if you are in Singapore.Very popular with the local Indians as well as tourists, so one may need to wait a bit to get your table,especially in the evening. And the wait a get a little longer during weekends.But the wait is worth every minute.A bit expensive compared to other Indian restaurants ,but the taste and quality of the food served compensates for it
1
Can't express my disgust enough without being outraged. We had really bad experience, not once or twice but 3 times. 1st time in the branch opposite Mustafa - we ordered food, waited for 25 mins, they didn't serve despite repeated reminders. Funny enough, people who came after us, ate n left, but we were still not served. Finally we gave up after 30min, and manager said "oo we forgot your order, plz wait for a few min, we will serve". Imagine the audacity manager had to ask us to wait another 15-20 min.2nd time in the main branch on Serangoon road - history repeated itself. Can't imagine the same thing happened again!!! But this time, i was prepared to pick a bone with manager. Finally, after 3 reminders and 25 minutes later, we were served cold curry n uncooked naan. And look at the hight of shame, manager first refused to speak with us, and finally when i spoke, he wasn't even apologetic.3rd time, again at Opp. Mustafa branch - I honestly didn't want to go in this place with pathetic service, but we had to go as the group of friends decided to go there. Substandard food was served, my friends ate it, I decided to wait and go to other place.I know my review wouldn't make a big difference as there are only a handful places serving vegetarian North Indian food, but plz do look for alternatives before choosing this place. Perhaps give a try to Panchtantra or Bikaner.
4
If you are craving for Indian Food, Chat, Snacks, Chole Bhature, Parantha, Paneer and Dal with Naan / Roti and Many other Options, Kailash Parbat is the place. Please visit the main serangoon road near the temple branch, for great ambience. Provide for waiting time on weekends / PH
4
I have visited several times its always best when it comes to chat specially dahipuri value for money great food and only need to improve in service ll visit again
4
Very Good option for Indian food in Little India. Taste is very good but is always crowded at Dinner times. You need to wait 15-30 minutes before you get a space.
4
Amazing Pav Bhaji, one of the best I've had in singapore. Their menu has a wide choice of vegetarian dishes.. we also had dahi puri as chaat, and it was equally tasty. Highly recommended for vegetarians.
5
Visited twice once for lunch and and once for dinner
good snacks and tot bits, good biryani.
overall good Indian vegetarian food.
4
Good quality Vegetarian food. nice service. it's always crowded need to wait in line outside restaurant.
4
Been there 3 times in 3 days. Blessings for veggies in S're. Awesome staff and food. Pl try chat items, they are awesome. They have out late next to mustafa, this one is better and bigger. Try to reach before 7 in eve to ahoid waiting even on weekdays. Taking taxi from this place in eve is difficult
5
Love going to restaurants which proudly showcases the real and authentic dishes and reflects the popular culture of India and thus instantly fell in love with Kailash Parbat. Kailash Parbat has several stores in India and overseas. I have been to their Mumbai store several times and just love it. The atmosphere is fantastic and the menu is simply great – vast and offers everything from north Indian food to south Indian food to Indian street food to Indian sweets. The Masala chole bhature was the best I have had in years (my 1 year toddler even gobbled up few bites and was wanting more), and the Papri chaat was so so wonderful – just perfect – full of flavours. They also serve authentic sindhi cuisine – yumm dal pakwaan – very few places in the world which serves sindhi food. I might have to move to Singapore just to be able to eat here more regularly or visit Singapore more often!The price was cheap and the food was delicious and flavourful. The staff were lovely and attentive too. You are not likely to find better Indian food, certainly not at the price, anywhere in Singapore. Kailash Parbat is about authenticity and keeping it real- real good Indian soul food. My top 5 favourite dishes at KP are Pav Bhaji, Masala Chole Bhature or the Bhature Platter, Chaat Platter, Papdi chaat and their selection of lassi’s.
3
Went there little early in the evening.Had a high expectations from the food because we tried earlier other outlet which is near to Mustafa.Ordered Gobi Manchurian. It came out to be Gobi Pakora style stuff (coated with lots of flour) which was awefull in look and wasteful in taste .Then we ordered Pani Poori . Not bad - StandardLater we decided to try Bhatura. Which was ok but not too good.Since Start was bad and mood was spoiled with Gobi Manchurian this we decided to stop there and could not order main course .Little pricy and could not find worth it for the starter quality.I might not visit this place again because there are a lot of places nearby which gives better taste
4
The experience is always awesome with KP. Their chaat and amazing mouth watering dishes one would always love to try. When away from home this is perfect place to get best vegetarian indian food. Their chaats are worth a try specially Pani Puri if you get the cravings
4
This place in Little india is worth going for Lunch or Dinner. You may have to wait for 15-30 minutes at peak time but the quality of food is much better than most restaurants in Delhi. They also serve nice Jain meals. Their chaat is awesome
4
Evenings are always crowded. Way too expensive. Masala Chai is my personal favorite here. Sev Poori, vegetable handi are my favorites.
4
We had two meals at this place and thoroughly enjoyed them. The food is delicious, the restaurant is clean, and the service prompt. We also tried chaat and it was good.
5
I stayed in Marrison hotel on Desker Road because this restaurent was just 100 mtrs from that hotel. This offered perfectly traditional Indian vegetarian food with excellent taste.
5
The best place for the Indian veg food lovers. Offers great variety and the taste is as good as it can be. Services are good. must go place for food lovers.
5
One of the best places to have vegetarian Indian food!!!! Right from chaat to the desert everything is delicious!!! A lot of options to choose from.
5
Serves the best North Indian food and chaat. The chaats are a kind of kailash parbat's speciality. Apart from this the Chinese cuisine was lovable.
5
When ever I visit Singapore, I go there for sure for lunch / dinner that too more than once. The food is to my liking (not too spicy) and the taste is good. The Jaipur pulav is tasty. Their sandwiches are also good to have.
4
Situated in Little Italy, this is a good place to get nice Indian vegetarian food. We went there on a Sunday evening and the restaurant was full. We had to wait but it was worth the trouble. The food is authentic and nice. The service is quick
5
This restaurant is a real gem in Singapore's vegetarian Indian food scene. Their chats are mouth watering Mumbai style chats.Must eats here are panipuri, sev puri and aloo tikki chat. It has one other signature dish also, chole bhatura. The bhaturas come in 4 varieties namely methi, masala, cheese and normal. Tried all of them and are deliciou
3
Had mixed experiences with KP.. had been to their restaurant in Mumbai - not high end but tasty.. in Singapore they are quite expensive but food is tasty.. in general consistent in taste except for a few instances.. try their chole bhature and chat items.. the ambiance in their Serangoon Road branch is better thant he Syed Alwi one.
5
Kailash Parbat is located in front of Mustafa mall and it offers tasty Indian food at reasonable price. North Indian dishes were well prepared and tasted like food made in India.
5
First things first : Food is oily .. but super tasty.. tried different chat items with family and all of them were good.
5
excellent restaurent with authentic indian dishes. clean place to have indian food in singapore. good value for money.
5
it was awesome experience to eat indian veg food in singapore...best taste with best price and very good staff....AWESOME..
5
We often visit Kailash parbat for its exquisite chaat specially the pani poori and papdi. The chole bhature is awesome and so is the pav bhaji. Must visit for chat lovers.
5
This has to be certainly the best Indian food SG has to offer. Have been there a dozen times now, at both locations and you can never be disappointed.
4
Offering pure veg food in singapore, thi place is good for people who wants to have Indian food,offering great variety in north indian food,quality is also good.
4
Excellent place to have good North Indian and South Indian food and snacks. Great ambience and good taste. Fine dining restaurant.
4
Kailash Parbat is good north Indian restaurant but especially for chat items.Must try Chole Bhatture or bhattura Platter.They have lot good variety of Indian snacks and Chats.But Mumbai Chats such as Pav Bhaji, Vada Pav, Ragada pattice are average taste.Sometimes it is too crowded so go early.They have other branch on Serangoon road as well which serves similar items.Service is good but sometime with more crowd it deteriorate
4
I am a regular at Kailash Parbat in India and hence did not hesitate trying it at Singapore as well. It has some really good dishes. None of the dishes we ordered disappointed. The bread portions are quite good too. Its little more expensive than other India eateries but you wouldn't feel because the food is so good
5
it was nice experience to have dinner at Kailash parbat. There were so many options to choose from. Chat platter was good. its mid-range on price point
4
We went for dinner during our stay at Singapore and I must tell you all that I got a proper Indian taste in the food opted by me. Clean and tasty food and service
5
Nice and efficient place with North Indian Cuisine, chaats and sweets. Very good service, tasty food at affordable rates, good seating in nice ambience, centrally located.
4
A good option for tasty indian food in Singapore...
Yummy pani puri and papdi chaat..
Felt good after having lunch here was on a long trip.
5
It was a pleasant experience to eat there.I was with family and had dinner there.
Xbxbxbxxnxnxnxnxnxmmx xnxnxmxxmxmxxmxxmxmmxmx
5
Great place with lot of options to choose from Chat, Starters, Aromatic Curries and desserts.
Delicious Food and nice service.
4
I absolutely love how the food is of great value and worth it. I patronize this restaurant almost every weekend. As a non-vegetarian, this has made me realize that vegetarian food can be excellent (I have been to many vegetarian restaurants that made me glad I was non vegetarian because of how bland the food is). Kailash Parbat was different and exceeds my expectations. I find myself returning here frequently. I especially love their Hyderabadi Briyani
4
We visited thrice during our stay. Nice place for some good veg indian food. Always crowded and busy, but the food and service is very good. Staff dont smile i dont know why, but rest is good. We had the bhalla papri chaat and it was very nice. Hyderabadi biryani should be improved, it comes with a palak gravy, which not how its suppose to be...!
5
Ambience - One of the very important things which anyone considers before going to any place, Kailash Parbhat at Imperial Hotel, sets the perfect tone for good lunch or dinner with your family and freinds!Food - This place is the one to go for any vegetarian north indian and indo-chinese cuisine! They also serve Jain food on request. The best part is that they have maintained the same taste of all their dishes which they originally started from India. Their speciality is chaat items specially Dahi Puri, Pani Puri, Chole Tikki ( The best in Singapore). Indian Chinese is the best so are their main course dishes. I personally like their Biryani. Since this chain of hotels is owned by a Sindhi, all Sindhi Delicacies are served on a Sunday!!! Trust me they are simply mouth watering and come with the same taste!!! In desserts their Kulfi Falooda and Jamun-e-Jannat (Rabri with Gulab Jamun) are something to die for!!!Service - Outstanding! Hope it sums it all.Price- Price is simply perfect. Approximately 40-50S$ for a 2 couples is a good value for money for some great quality food, ambience and service.A must visit for all Singaporeans and tourists from across the Globe!!!
5
I have dined at Kailash Parbat on several occasions. They have plenty of choices and food is just delicious. I like all kind of dishes and naan(bread) choices here. My wife enjoys the CHAATs. I wouldn't hesitate this restaurant to anyonewho wants to enjoy a proper Indian vegetarian meal. Expensive compared to other traditional vegetarian restaurants
4
Good food but the hotel is very expensive as compared to other restaurants in singapore for Indian food. A little difficult to find it too.
5
Went for dinner and had pani poori, bhel poori chaat items. Also naans and paneer butter masala, very tasty and fast efficient service. Slightly on the expensive side but worth a visit
4
We had a fine dinner at this restaurant. True vegetarian restaurant offering wide variety of foods. The place was clean and the staff was friendly and attentive. Prices were okay for the area and the facility.
4
The food was awesome specially the ALOO DUM, it tasted even better than what we get back in India in most of the descent restaurants
4
Have already written about their palak paneer and Chole - we also recently tasted their Awadhi Biryani last weekend - and it was superb! Made in authentic style, this has a good quantity of gravy vegetables and rice..we ended up overeating that day:) Also want to point out- Jyoti and Chandradev are two of the best folks out there in case you do visit. Very helpful and efficient
4
The food is very good, we tried the chaats, starters and mains, couldn't fault any of them. Service is quick as well. A little bit pricy, however you get your monies worth. Overall you can't wrong with kailash Parbat. Only complain is the long waiting times on Saturdays and Sunday...it is very popular in Singapore!!

Ragda Patties was lousy and quite cold.. no energy. Club sandwich was another disappointing experience -- in fact this was one of good item they served earlier at Syed Alwi Road. But over this place it was horrible --- the potato in the sandwich was without any masala / taste.Overall I strongly recommend the restaurant owner to improve on North Indian food / taste, food should be tasty -- have some energy

This restaurant offers all delicacies that you can get in any Indian restaurant. the food tastes the similar to most of the food that we get in any good indian restaurant close to your favourite one. Please try this restaurant if you are looking for good indian food. The owner is super supportive and help you with all kind of problems if you are facing any ask for her help and she will help you the most she can. We ate here almost everyday for five days consecutively
4
Please ensure you come here with your belly and bladder empty. Food taste is excellent. Must try bhatura, haka noodles, pani poori, aloo tiki chaat without dahi. Decent sandwich. Mild spice and hence suits children. Please try not to visit the loos as this sight will ruin your health for minimally one wee

The interior of this place is really nice. Unfortunately, the food was really bad. The manchow soup tasted more like Manchuria gravy, far too spicy and garlicky. The jhalfrezi was sweet, the daal makhani too watery. The only thing that tasted good was daal tadka. The quality of the food has been consistent, it was just as unsavory the last time I dined here.
5
Very authentic, service is amazing...can't go wrong if you are looking for North Indian...been here few times now.
4
Enjoyed dal tadka jeera rice and roti.
food quality is very good and hotel and ambience also good and meal is also good.
5
In my last family visit we went to Kailas Parbat Where we find amazing and traditional Indian Food with Indian Taste. Must visit and Enjoy the Traditional Indian Food. Must visit place
4
The restaurant looked very chic, so we were afraid we had to pay much, but it was not. We asked for bread (we are too Dutch xD). We got what you can see on the picture and it tasted good!
5
Well maintain and decent places for lunch and dinner with couples and big group , all the dishes are well prepared and perfect Indian tastes of India. Well decorated restaurant and polite staff , enjoyed the 4 Day meals at Kailash parbat ...at Singapore.
5
Great chaat items and snacks. Loved the tea! Was missing India and this was the perfect evening sipping tea after a long tiring day! Very nice staff, accommodating and helpful!
5
My husband was worried because he doesn't believe a meal can be a meal if it has no meat. We did not realise it was vegetarian until we sat down. With the help of the waiter we ordered our meals and were pleasantly surprised with some of the best Indian food we have ever eaten. The restaurant also looked a lot more modern than surrounding restaurants in little India.
4
We went to this place one evening as the taste buds started tingling upon seeing Kailash Parbat. Ordered for Pani poori and some more stuff from the chat family.Well, not as great as the ones you might get in Mumbai, but the quality was good, considering you are in Singapore. Decent place. Bang opposite Mustafa, near gate 3
4
Steadily growing in Singapore over the last 6 years, KP is possibly one of the best Indian restaurant. Cuisine=======Primarily north Indian Vegetarian, Mumbai chat and sandwiches, Indo Chinese, Sindhi dishes, sweets, Falooda etcIt covers quite a big range.My preference ===========Sev Puri ( Chat)Paneer Khurchan ( I'm sure the spelling is wrong)Hyderabadi Biriyani ( Subtle but amazingly flavoursome)Located diagonally opposite to Khansama (another famous restaurant), usually the place is crowded (especially on weekends).Ideal for a lunch with your family or even a party with friends, KP is indeed a must go restaurant if you are in SG
4
Had been to this restaurant couple of times. Staff is courteous and take care special food for toddlers/kids, if instructed properly. If you are missing India for Dosas, Pav Bhaji and other chaat items, then this is the place for you. Service is quick and food is tasty. What else you want
4
This is a nice big restaurant . The food is good and some is the service . We can buy sweets from here and they have a special area where we can have our personal parties .
1
What u don't expect as u enter a restaurant is horrible stink.. is the owner totally ignorant! Can't believe it!
I know that their food is good - have eaten at the outlet on Serangoon road near the temple - surely much better..
2
Was disappointed with the service. Had to request for everything from sugar to tissues..when asked to pack, the extra food, it was done hurridly as a result of which most food(bread sandwich) gt soaked in chutney when I reachd home
5
Almost all menu items are good to try. Price is on higher side but worth it. Service is great. I have been visting for 2 years, was never disappointed. Must visit if you are indian vegeterian.
4
The staff who assisted us was bery helpful in educating us of the Indian dishes they served. Having eaten Indian cuisine only a handful of times still makes me a newbie and I still do not know what to order in am Indian restaurant. We were lucky to have a helpful host that made our dinner unforgetful
4
been there 2 years ago. Situated in Little India this place was heaven for me. They serve great Food at their prices. Not very cheap not very expensive. Food is great. Service is nice. Ambience is great. Visited this place almost everyday during my visit to Singapore.
2
I visited with my family to Kailash Parbat after reading reviews on trip advisor. But my experience was totally opposite We ordered Channa Bhatura. It came after 40 minutes. The chana was also hard and half cooked. The service is so slow that when we ordered extra bhatura, they took 20 minutes to deliver. Not happy at all with the service and also ambience. The ambience is also very dingi.
5
As a family tour we came here and as usual wanted onky Indian food could satisfy our hunger!!Kailash parbat is best in town and really every night for 10 days we came here and enjoyed a lot!!Very very delicious home like food was served and we were satisfied each and every time! A real value for mone
2
Very disappointed. The chaat items we ordered - papdi chaat, sev puri and ragada sev puri - all ingredients (especially the fried items like boondi and papdi) tasted stale and old. I have eaten at this place several times over the last 5 years and the quality of food has plummeted. DO NOT EAT HERE. Costly and horrible food. Service is only decent thing about the place. The staff is prompt. We also ordered Gobi Manchurian (no taste, pieces too big so undercooked) and fried rice (too oily, bland, cheap vegetables
1
I heard so much about this place and I went here when it first opened (and even recently), the "authentic" food that they describe in the menu is not really authentic and it's really pricey. Did not like any of the food and I ended up leaving more than half the dishes I ordered.
5
Excellent food
Flavourfull
Hot and spicy
Felt like home Indian food
Buzzing atmosphere with some soft music
Very friendly service
Would recommend to everyone
4
It was really a wonderful experience to have veg food ...lil bit on costly side but still as the food is good so makes it worth it ...one should definately try with family and kids for authentic Indian veg
4
Visited restaurant located in little India Singapore for dinner and lunch. Food including starters of Chaat is tasty, hygienious and delicious.
Chaat, Cholle Bhature, Dal Makhani, Gulab Jamun every thing was just yummy and authentic Indian .
4
The best Bhel Puri I have ever eaten. This is a low key restaurant with a nice atmosphere. Good service and easy surroundings make for an "I'll be back " restaurant.
5
Staff well received, near to little india, please order Pavbhaji, Pani-puri, Sevi Puri and in last Kulfi without fail.....One of the best place for Chat items
4
We try the palak paneer (which also has methi, so unique taste) and chana masala with sindhi chapati (Chana Bhatura is the main favourite there, but we choose the healthier option!) and it's been consistent in its taste. The Dal and Jeera rice are also good. We have tried their Falooda's and they are tasty too. Chandradeo and Jyoti are always smiling and provide very good service, so we have been going there a number of times latel
3
Great location near Mustafa, an easy stagger to this vegetarian Sindhi joint after an afternoon of fighting the scrum in Mustafa. The service is average however this is ideal for those looking for a refreshing Chai, Snacks and recovery after an energy sapping session at Mustafa next door. The Paani Poori and Paid Chaat hit the spot and the Kulfi Falooda was a hit with the kids. My eldest pronounced it the best Falooda she has ever had
4
Had been there recently during my stay in Singapore. One of the better North Indian restaurants in Little India.The chat items and Chole Bhature were good.I suppose it needs to improve on its North Indian dishes as the neighbouring Panchatantra is gonna give it run for its money..
2
We had a family lunch at this restaurant a few days ago. The service was slow and it was a pain getting the attention the service staff. The Hot and Sour Soup ordered tasted only of corn flour and the 2 'Panner' or Cottage Cheese North Indian dishes tasted and looked and same. The restaurant was noisy and unkept with dirty floors. I am not going back here for sure.
5
It's a good restaurant.Pure vegetarian as well as we got jain Punjabi food also.Restaurant internal dÃ©cor is superb.It's big & spaces Soups , Punjabi sabji variety, & all food taste is great.Staff & services is great.Don't miss to eat at this place as a Tourist
3
Staff remembers talk very rudely and do not give atuff like spoons,however food was well and good to eat
5
Kailash Parbat does not makes you fell you are away from Home. Its located bang opposite Mustafa. Things to try Pav Bhaji, Biryani and KP special chat
5
I am very late to post but must say this was god send for veg Indian family. We ate for 6 days out of 7 days. Amazing food, service and ambience. Thank you for making our trip memorable
5
We order only the following types of dishes here, the most authentic Punjabi styled preparation in Singapore - varieties of mouth watering "chole bhature" and awesome "chaats"
3
We went for Dinner on Ganesh Chaturthi. Place was crowded but we were promptly given seats.Service was excellent, very prompt and accomodating as one member ordered Jain food.Foodwise its disappointing, atleast based on what we ordered this time. Soups were tasteless (Hot n Sour, and Sweet Corn). Aloo Chat was bland in taste too.Hyderabadi Veg biryani was a big disappointment. Paneer ke Soole (Grilled Cottage Cheese) and Chinese fried rice was ok to some extent.Didnt try the Dessert
4
I have eaten here six times in the last three years. When I visit Singapore I try a lot east Asian food, but after a few nights of eating with chopsticks, this Punjabi has to have some North Indian food and eat with his hands. The menu is very extensive, but I have only tried four things: samosa chaat; pani puri; chole + masala bhatura; ras malai. It's what I crave: comfort food from childhood. Maybe next time I will try something else. They do all of them very well. Restaurant is very clean and bright compared to most of the Indian restaurants in Little India. I will be back next time
4
After a long trip and trying out different food, felt like Indian veg food. Replica of the Indian Kailash Parbat with the same menu. Began with Sev Puri and then tried the chole and kulcha accompanied by raita and papad. Tends to get crowded due to the Indian area and visitors but quick turn around of people. Must try.
2
We ordered two fizzy drinks, a coffee, two entrees, two mains and a naan.The entrees were plain and uninteresting. Spice dusted dry potatoes with day old chopped coriander on top. Blergh. One drink (sparkling mineral water) didn't turn up so we asked for it again and got a room temperature bottled still water. Sent that back and ensued a long and boring conversation about what sparkling water is. We decided not get no fizzywater at all (there was tap water on the table already), and 5 minutes later a lime sparkling lime drink turned up (yep, one we specifically said we didn't want). The waitress honestly didn't give a rats, hardly listening the first time and not taking the time to get it right.Nowhere does it say that this is a VEGETARIAN restaurant so I've just saved you 10 mins trying to find a chicken dish on the menu. The curries we ate for dinner were quite nice - good temperature (both spice wise and temperature wise), and good portions. The naan was ok but not the best.You can see the hand washing basin to the toilets from the dining room which is a bit weird. And there is a bizarre combination of English and non-english on the menu so we could hardly work out what the dishes were. The restaurant was full of families with noisy kids so I definitely wouldn't recommend it after a long flight. Locals may love this place once they know what their favourite dish is, but it's not suitable for tourists
3
Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa has a good ambience and the service is good. The place gets busy on weekdays after 12 pm. Lot of families drop in with kids. Thete is a good selection of North Indian cuisine. They offer a diverse range of Sindhi dishes and chaat. The restaurant was clean and the air conditioning was doing a good job on a hot and humid day.I tried their Chana Bhatura with sweet lassi. The meal cost SGD 18 bucks with taxes. The chana bhatura consists of 2 non oily medium sized bhaturas. The chana was average as I was expecting the chana to have more interesting flavours and aroma. The sweet lassi was very good and not diluted with water that is commonplace at most joints in the Little India area. Those on a tight budget or looking for value for money are probably better off exploring other joints
1
Thought of having snacks and tea so went there to a known place I have visited for years..this time round it was a public holiday and the place was not crowded at all..asked the staff about an item in the menu and he said it's written there just see it yourself! Each item took forever to arrive and it didn't taste as good as it used to.. Even their famous paani puri has become terrible! Staff were walking around and didn't pay attention when I call them..after the first dish everything took forever to arrive...tea wouldn't have arrived if I didn't remind and it was not even hot... Overall a big disappointment and won't bother going back there again
2
The service was poor... Food taste is so so. We ordered Ali go hi which was very bland and not cooked properly. Roti tori was so cold. Butter milk very watery.
5
I had been here 2 years ago and loved it. The first place that came to mind during my business trip this year was this one. Their chaat it just fantastic. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for some mind blowing chaat.
5
Delicious food well known for their Chaats that are so tasty and come with so many different fillings. Highly recommended
5
Another place to visit in SG is Kailash Parbat for authentic North Indian food experience. The chole bhatures, the palak paneer and the jal jheera are items one must taste here for sure. Ideally located in Little India, spacious and a good experience overall
4
We visited this place about 3-4 times during our 8 days in Singapore. It's a nice place for chaats. Liked their chola Bhatura too. Service was nice as well.
Visited in August 2013
4
The food was quite awesome ! Didn't expect it to be that good when entered . Do try veg manchurian and chole bature. Chaat was a kinda disaster though. But except that the food was excellent.
4
It has become my most favorite Indian vegetarian restaurant over couple of years, it is bit pricy due to the quality of the food they serve. It is best place for chat (paani/dhahi/bhel poori etc), roti/naan basket with assorted naans are awesome. Four of us including two kids went there last week, we ordered quite few items like couple of veg curries, 2 assorted naan baskets, dhahi poori etc, bill was 90+ SGD. You can get the same food within 50-60SGD in other restaurants around Syed Alwi Road but not the quality. Very conveniently located opposite Mustafa shopping Centre. Note: longer waiting time during weekends, not a place for south Indian food
4
there are 2 locations of this. One is opposite Mustafa which was excellent a few years ago and now is consistently dirty and I refuse to step foot inside. But if you want great food and are willing to trek it about 10 minutes down the next street, you will find the main location which is big bright airy and has the most delectable food. worth a stop on any trip
4
This is part of the famous Mumbai Restaurant chain and have two outlets in Singapore.We come here to eat Chola Bhatura and some chaat. The food is good and reasonably priced. Pani Puri and Pav Bhaji are the only let downs here. Be warned on weekends it is very difficult to get seating so go on weekdays. Kids love the place and we recommend this place.
5
Visited Kailash Parbat for an early dinner on a weekday evening. Restaurant was fairly full although it was a weekday. Interior decoration is elegant and lighting was pleasant. We enjoyed the papri chaat and dahi puri for starters, which were really nice. Overall, we had nice dining experienc
4
Just dropped in for a quick kulfi after lunch and found it pricey (SGD 10 each) but very testy and well prepared. Service and ambience is good too.
4
Its originally a chain from Mumbai. They have 2 restaurants in Singapore.
You will get all the authentic Punjabi food + chat items + Indian sweets.
2
seats are clustered, heard a lot about the name but very upset with rundown service and bad quality of north indian food. Was half cooked
5
The food quality was good complete indian menu available there worth paying for all options it costs about 25 sgd per person
5
We headed to KP before going on our shopping spree..and we loved every thing we ordered. Food tasted nothing less.
4
A colleague introduced me to this restaurant and I try to visit whenever I am in Singapore. Some nights can be busy, but the wait is well worth it. The chaat and gulab jamun are as good as can be.
3
Great foodLots of options to choose. Hara bara kebab was very yummy. Naan and side dish gravies were very yummy and perfectly cooked. Pani puri was very hard. Dahi puri Dahi was veri veri frozen cold.Should less oil in the gravies. Naan and chapattis tasted great. Waitress was annoying .We ordered 7 chapathis and she kept on annoying are you going to eat all or any of your Friends coming or you going to pack food for home.Which was quiet irritating and no manners.They should better teach the waitress who takes order to stop asking nonsense to customers. There are people who eat lot and 7 chapathis are not too much for 2 people. Finally food was great and she was not harsh and other people were friendly and neat clean ambience. But her way of questioning was annoying and it's none of her business to question us on are we going to eat all or pack or ordering for friends
4
We had the balla papdi chaat which was excellent along with the chaat platter which was good. The naan is done nicely while the pashtoon dal makhni and diwani handi were excellent! I did not really like the hobo manchurian with gravy - in future I'll stick to the dry version. The mango lassi is lovely as was the sweet and salty lime juice! The masala chai was good and the desserts here are excellent! Nice place for a family visit. Price is around $20-30 a person
2
Went to the Belilios Road outlet(there's another one on syed alwi road) today for some Chaat, Paani Puri and Desserts. The puri for the paani puri tasted oily and stale and the same for chaat platter. Complained to the waiter about it but no one really cared. The desserts were good. The only highlight of the trip. The main course probably tastes better and is probably the reason for it's popularity but I'd give it a miss otherwise
5
If you want to have a great taste of north Indian or south or west Indian, this is the right place to goVisited numerous times, and like the food always.This is pure vegetarian restaurant, so a plus for us. It's a bit pricey though, the quality compensate the price.A must visit for Indian food lovers.They hVe one more branch just opposite to gate no 2 of Mustafa near Anand bhawan. That place is smaller compared to this one. Ambience is quite nice
1
They believe in quantity and not quality. They have created a hype to overcharge customers. I recommend TRY OTHER PLACES. AVERAGE FOOD AND SERVICE QUALITY COMPARED TO PRICES
1
no care for the customers , only interested in collecting money . went with friends and lot of hopes but really disappointed . my first and last visit there
4
It would made life easier if they had English descriptions under their dishes' names. The mango lassi was delicous as it should be. If you are looking for a slightly decent place for a dinner, this would be it.
5
Go to place for north Indian food. Good place, friendly staff, tasty food. Usually crowded but definitely worth the wait.
5
it was a heaven for veterinarian person in Singapore .. it was little bit costly but safe veg food ..kailash prabhat is situated in little india area below grand imperial hotel .when you are in singapore think kailash prabhat
4
Service & Quality you expect from KP Chain, is maintained. Was pleasantly surprised with super-quick service allowing faster turn around. Popular amongst Indians as well as other nationals. Clean & comfortable seat-in restaurant. Worth visit again.
5
Good Indian food was available here...though a bit costly but worth it..Good for Indians who want to have Indian meal while in Singapore..Jain food was not available..but the Amras puri during mango season was simply heavenly...
3
It is a decent chat corner but nothing great to rave about. The prices are on the higher side. The service was pretty laid back and had to wait for dishes once the order was placed. The servers do not wear gloves and Hygiene factor could be improve
4
This restaurant offers North Indian fare and is one of the few places where I have gone more than a couple of times for its Chole-Bhature. Good service, cheap prices and good spread make it a bargain. If you are craving for north Indian food in SG then you can give this place shot
4
Excellent location for Indian vegetarian foodies.If you like Indian food you should visit this place while in Singapore.Very good and prompt service. Neat and clean place.Only if you have patience to wait as it has good patronage.I would definitely recommend this place
5
Very nice restaurant.. Its not a big place.. service is good. food is also good.. North and South Indian both food taste is awesome.. almost all variety of food.. staff is humble.. Best for Jain food.. I recomend this Restaurant
5
In Singapore if you want Indian vegetarian food this is heaven.
Ambiance- Excellent
Quantity of Food - Excellent
Quality of food- Excellent
Service- Fast and Excellent
Value for money
You just can't go wrong here.
4
If you miss indian food in Singapore..do try Kailash Parbat. It serves all indian delicacy and amazing chaat.
5
Hey guys!If you are searching for a good North-Indian restaurant with the best chaats and Chole bhathures, this is the best place. I have been there multiple of times. The Pani puri there is heavenly. The restaurant has an amazing ambience and is clean. It is definitely expensive but the food is worth the money. I hope my review helps you guys!Bye!
2
We ordered for pav bhaji and samosa. Both of them were stale... and smelling. While the restaurant manager took note.... There was no action nor ay kind of apology.... Surprisingly.... Kailash parbat does mot have a feedback form. So there kind of food quality and service matters are either very frequent to maintain track or just dont matter.Next time you visit just ask if they have freshly prepared anything and then order
5
This is know as a good restaurant for Indian food lover. Ambience of the restaurant is good as a normal restaurant and staff is also nice with quick service. They have number of Indian food starting from starter to main course, chaat etc. I have tried there samosa chats and pannipuri both was good. There main course is also good and feel you like you are sitting in a places with in India.
3
Our second time, in as many years. Didn't feel welcome at all as we walked in. Tired, insipid and uninterested staff. This ws at 3:00 pm when it wasn't busy.Bhel puri LOUSY! Dahi puri OK; Salted Lassi a thick slurry. Left half and it took as long to get the bill as the man who oversees chaat preparation also closes the bill!! One man dhaba moe efficient
1
I went to Kailash Parbat to celebrate my birthday yesterday with some chaat (as I love paani puri a lot). I ordered for one plate paani puri and one plate dahi puri. I was so disappointed with both these dishes. The pooris used were very hard and oily. It actually bruised my mouth. The sweet and spicy water of pani puri were nice. The dahi puri was horrible. The puri was again oily and hard, the sev used as topping was stale and smelly. The tea they served was cold. The ambiance was nice though but the chaat was a complete NO! NO!We went there with high expectations and were left disappointed
5
I had visited this restaurant based on internet reviews. My experience was awesome. We were fedup with typical punjabi food and visited this place for a change. The fulka roti and aloo matar was awesome. Do try khichdi which is also delicious. The food was a bit costlier but tastes awesome and hence is recommended. It is located in little india area as is good for indian vegetarian visitors
5
Kailash Parbat is part of the Indian restaurant chain from Mumbai. The restaurant offers some of the best Indian street side food in addition to some of the best North and South Indian dishes. Located in the heart of Little India it is one the favorite for all tourists visiting Singapore and looking for Indian food. This is a must visit place for all food lovers
4
Our menu:
- koki - sindhi roti
- daal makhni
- paneer in cashew gravy
- papad
- roti of course
koki was at its best.. must say good for sindi food.. its best you can find in SG.. indian food of course is good...
5
Highly recommend we didn't know what to order but the lovely waiter made suggestions which we were happy to go along with. Amazing !! Don't bother to have wine or beer. It's warm and overpriced Food excellent tho !
5
We have visited Kailash Parbat with family numerous times - both little India and Syed Alvi Road. Excellent Place, the quality of food is very good and everytime - no exception. The Panner dishes and the Jaipur Biryani is excellent. You do not feel bloated after the food though the food is made in Ghee and rich in calories. Excellent service and good staff. Excellent chat items. Must visit
5
KP ws our favourite place while we were on a holiday 2 singapore. The food is just amazing and the service is very fast. Tried pav bhaji,chole bathura,lassi and even north indian dishes but didnt felt that we are eating at a restaurant outside india. We felt as if we are eating at a indian restaurant in india
5
I have been to Kailash Parbat on multiple occasions, and its quality has always been consistently good. The place is a hit among the indian community and I have hardly seen any empty seats.The menu has lots of options. They have indian chaat, panipuri and chhole bhature all quite good, and which you wont find in many places. The yellow and black daals served here are extremely good! Paneer dishes are excellent as well.The service is efficient and the seating arrangement has space for both small or big groups. Prices are mid-range and put to shame any indian eatery outside Little India. This is one of the best 'bang for the buck' indian restaurants in Singapore
5
Kailash parbat is a regular for us (we are Indians) and a place where we take family visiting from home too - they never get disappointed by the authentic taste.The chaats and street corner food are the best. It being a Sindhi restaurant, would highly recommend trying Koki there (a type of bread which has spices and is fried). Bhatura and Pav Bhaji are excellent too.. With such good street food, I have tried eating the main course meals only once and decided to stick with the street food.For people with a sweet tooth, try the Jamun-e-Jannat (Hot gulab jamuns in cold rabri)We are regulars here and will keep on visiting. Prefer the Belilios Lane outlet to the one at Syed Alwi roa
4
Had been to this place during our Singapore visit of 2 days. We had dinner here both days. This is a chain of restaurant across india and the quality and standards are maintained here as well. The food is very tasty and authentic indian food is available. For those who feel homesick this is the best option. Located in little India locality, truely feels like home. The prices are a bit high but its worth i
5
This review is based on our second visit to this lovely restaurant. Last time we had Dahi Bhalla Chaat and Chole Bhature, which were EXCELLENT ! This time, we had Corn Malai Seekh Kabaabs, and Kayberi Kadjai Paneer with a Bread Basket. All the items were superb and mouth-watering, and we had a hearty meal. Another nice thing about them is their location, it is bang opposite Mustafa Center, so its very convenient before a round of grocery shopping to have a heart meal !
5
If you haven't tried KP, you are missing an important Indian joint. I have visited this multiple times and have tried a number of food varieties. Some one of the recommended ones are Bhindi masala, Palak paneer, garlic naan (highly recommended), pav bhaji, manchow soup, fried rice, gobi manchurian and finally masala chaas
4
Nice ambience and quality of food is good. You should try Ajwaini panner tikka my all time favourite. Eventhough, their service is not up to the mark and little bit expensive but you will not disappointed with the quality of the food. They serve Indo Chinese food (for example manchurian
3
Kailash Parbat offers a good variety of authentic and tasty Indian snack food. However, I think that they are overpriced.
5
The best place to have Indian food when you are in Singapore. The food here is lip-smacking and also with the budget.
4
Very good food. Very friendly staff. Worth visiting if you are a vegetarian. Located near Mustafa and easily approachable.
4
We had been here a few times. The good is definitely above average, the service is excellent but I believe due to the Brand name "Kailash Parbat", the place is overly hyped.. Recommended to try though. Huzayf
4
Visited this restaurant with a great expectation.
Ordered starters than main course.
Everything was good and service was great.
Little pricy but ok to pay since the taste was good.
Happy and satisfied customer!
Thanks..
2
Average food and pathetic service sums up this place aptly !! I am not sure why it's regarded as one of the better Indian restaurants in Singapore - most dishes taste stale!! Freshness is something that is not offered on their menu and so is the service. Servers seem to have been forced to work.Give this place a miss and try out loads of better ones during your next visit to Singapore.
5
Its a paradise for vegetarians! Truly! The food is amazing! Ambiance & staff add up to the goodness.They serve mainly north-India food. However, their starts are the highlight. Chaat, pani-poori can be eaten anytime. The price range is mid-high. but totally worth it!You will usually find queue on weekends so prefer making reservation
5
Kailash Parbat is one of best Indian restaurant in Singapore.In little India area there are two branches of the same. We goes to the bigger one. It's ambiance is good and staff is very good. You can find all types of Indian vegetarian food including chaat, snacks, South Indian, North Indian and many varieties. One can fully satisfy after eating here. Rates are high but taste of food is awesome
4
Restaurants galore at Syed Alwi Road but this is a stand out vegetarian option in the crowd. Went there one evening around 5pm, hoping to get some chaat and we got exactly what we wanted. Their samosa chaat and bhel puri were excellent. My wife wanted a chola bhatura and that tasted great too! I was disappointed that basundhi was not available, but got rasamalai instead. It was a bit of a let down as it wasn't sweet enough to me. This is a good vegetarian option for those who want to taste north indian and chaat, but the prices are a bit on the higher side
4
Kailash Parbat is an excellent choice for Indian veggie food seekers in Singapore. There are 2 locations - one on Serangoon Road and one located opposite Mustafa on Syed Alwi Road.They boast a large menu with a lot of food items raging from chat items like sev puri/pani puri to panner curries, nan/roti/kuclha, biriyani etc.Overall an excellent choice
3
Visited this place only once, the food was decent, the sitting is ok. Their outlet at bellilos road is better
5
This is a must visit place for Indian vegetarian food lovers, there are plenty of options ranging from Chats, Snacks and main course food. Don't forget to have the masala chai here and of course don't leave without satisfying your sweet tooth :)

Whenever i feel home sick, i go to this place for good chaat ..
Especially
Pani puri
College grill sandwich
Food is really good.. All the products are very well served and has good quality..
5
We r surprise to see lots of variety of chaats in singapore .we take dinner in this restaurant. taste was too good ambience is OK.
3
Good authentic food. Indian taste. Slightly overpriced specially Tandoori Roti. Ambience is good. Staff is South Indian so difficult to communicate in hindi.
Chana bhatura is good.
2
had the chhole bhature here after hearing really good reviews.
But after the meal i felt like i drank a pint of refined oil

If you wish to have decent North Indian vegetarian food near Mustafa then I will surely recommend this one. Evenings are crowded and the staff are usually quite tensed in managing the crowd. Quite often you see even the chefs struggling and the food takes time to be served. But once you get it, it's good!They used to have Arbi tuk, which was heavenly. They seem to have taken it out of the menu and sometimes reluctantly give you it's half Cousin, aloo tuk. The chaat items are extremely good and the Chef at the chaat counter is extremely kind to make them the way you want.Chole Bhatura is quite oily but who cares - it's consistently good. Bhatura and Parata platters which have three or four different types of them are quite filling for two and are highly recommended. Hyderabadi biryani and the Awadhi biryani are also quite good.Chaaz is always too salty but lassis are good. Desserts are just okay.It's a bit pricey but would certainly recommend as it serves one of the best North Indian dishes in this area.
3
The chaats are delicious - the three of us had three chaats which was one too many but the waiter was totally unhelpful with advice on the right quantities for three people. The Hyderabad biryani and curd rice were very good too, as was the dhal and bendi. But why did we feel so rushed? They kept coming to clear the dishes, kept asking if we were done and then brought the bill before we had even asked for it! Noisy. Stressful. Not returning anytime soon, but they probably won't notice.

I visited this restaurant on my way to the major department store across of it as I was craving some Masala tea. I like the Masala tea freshly made and with no sugar. I know this place makes it with both requirements. While the tea itself was what I expected, the service have much to improve. I asked for the tea from an attendant upon entering. She was counting coins and even though seemed she took the order, I wasn't sure as there was no welcoming response, and just kept counting coins. I sat down hoping an attendant would approach, but to no avail. I stood up to get the menu myself as I considered also having some snacks. Was about to walk out since no one approached and was unsure the tea order was made, but just then the tea arrived(on a cup poorly served and stained from serving the tea itself). Just decided to have the tea but no snacks. The snack options on the menu are not as varied either. During my entire stay, no one approached. The tea is good but the service has much to improve. Likely will not return either.
4
A restaurant with history- specially for chaat , chole bature and authentic sindhi food. The gol-gappe/panipuri was very good, better than in India and so was papri,ragda-patis.Also enjoyed four types of chole bature but the paneer bature was the best. The Indian curry was average but the lachha paratha was good. The cleanliness and ambiance was very good. Convenient being next to Mustafa Indian Departmental Store.Indian sweets are really very good.The price band for food items is reasonable
5
Visited recently
Refered by a fellow shopper in mustafa plaza
Excellent bhaturas. ---- 4 different flavours
Plain paneer masala and methi
Huge serve if channas(chickpeas)
And onion salad
All for 18 dollars
Very happy chappy restaurant men and lovely friendly service
4
The taste was osome and chat is so good tea is also like indian taste nise place I visit here 2 time
3
We ordered food at our Hotel.The food was average but a bit expensive .They dont provide onions with the food which was a minus
3
Veg Restaurant similar to one's in Mumbai
Chole bhatura was tasty
It is located close to Mustafa centre.
5
Good service, cooperative employees and beautiful ambience. I want to go again and I will recommend to others also.
4
We have celebrated many occasions - my birthday, our anniversary, took mom-dad and casual Friday lunch with office mates. And we celebrated New Year 2016 dinner here too.The place always lives upto the expectations. Amazing Chaat items - Sev Puri Chaat, Veg starters - Paneer Plack pepper. I simply love the daal makhni here. Diwani Handi was also good.Enjoyed Rabdi to the core in the deserts. It is a proper dine-in restaurant with pleasing ambiance. May appear expensive to some but it is the price for food and place.The only advice I would like to make to the management is, they need to improve the service level consistently. Train employees how to deal with situations and improve the level of attentiveness towards customers, kind advice since we are regular visitors. Hire part timers for weekends and special occasions if that helps
4
Go to Kailash Parbat with family to try different varieties of ChaatThe Bhatura platter is a must-try with different varieties like the methi and masala variants. Easily the best dish in this place.Pani puri and the ragda pattice was reasonable. Was disappointed with the Kulfi dessert as it was not upto the mar
4
Went to Kailas Parbat as we longed for home food, was not disappointed. Was really satisfying to eat here after shopping at Mustafa Centre. Avoid going there on Public holidays as its too crowded. try going in the afternoon when its not crowded. Tasty food, good service with a smile.Was served well
4
Our preferred Vegetarian only North Indian restaurant in Little India area. Our regular picks are Paneer Tikka, Pani Puri, Dahi papdi chat. Tasty vegetarian dishes for main course and finishing touch with Jamuni Jannat, rasa malai :) Recommend for lunch / dinner with family & friends .
5
Have been to Kailash Parbat in India many time and found the one in Little India to be as good as the one in India. Good options for vegetarians. When placing the order remember that the quantity is good (much more than in most places) so place an order accordingly. Food was good and so was the service. Good atmosphere. If in Little India opt for Kailash parbat much better than all the restaurants opposite Mustafa market. As they are opposite Mustafa normally one goes but Kailash Parbat is also hardly 3 to 5 minutes walk from mustaf
5
Nice restaurant for vegetarian food in Little India. Courteous and prompt service, not very expensive.
5
Authentic Indian food is the highlight of the place. Though it is a bit pricey, but the taste justifies the price. Chaats are yummy.
3
The place is slightly like a Fine dining restaurant in Little India. Hence it is pretty expensive compared to the other restaurants in Little India. The food is decent.
4
this is the place for Chats and other north Indian delicacies. we had visited the place multiple times and the experience is good. its towards the expensive side.
1
This was seriously the worst food I have ever had in my life after paying so much! The samosa was nothing to talk about, bathing in oil for I don't know how many hours, I cannot even be sure if it was made the same day! N the paratha was even worse, fully uncooked from the inside.. Forget about cleanliness if u have to visit this place.. I was so damned disappointed.. N its all so expensive, so u obviously expect good quality but that does not seem to be the case! Anyway I would never ever go back to eat here.
4
Have visited many times and tried a variety of dishes. Some of my all times favourites here are Do Rukha Kumbh - stuffed grilled mushrooms, papdi chat and kulfi falooda. All chat items and curries are good; but rice items are a bit disappointing. Desserts are rich and delicious
3
We chose this place as it looked like they would have air-conditioning and offer some respite form the Singapore heat-and it did.We arrived late lunch and despite the sparse crowd, the wait staff were in no hurry to serve. The food however was delicious and well worth it. Pricier than the surrounding restaurants in Little India but worth it for the quality of food and the air-conditionin
4
Went for a repeat visit at this place last week and was pleased to note that their chole bhatura is really good! we did try pani puri and that was not good at all. Tried another interesting dish-ragda pattice sandwich! not bad. But stick to CB and you will never be disappointe
3
This is a typical restaurant like we have back home (Mumbai, India). I have been there couple of times just for the craving of chaats and this is one of the few Jain food options in Singapore. Except for the taste of Indian food (almost all items) and the sweets, I did not find anything great about this place. Place looks to little cramped, and it turns out to be too noisy when full. We (6 of us) were given a table which was joint with another table for capacity of 4, so it felt like we were together and sharing meals :). Service is worse, they cannot manage when the crowd is full and the frustration will come out on one of us if we are unlucky when we ask them for an additional service like providing glasses to drink water. I believe it was a bad day for us. They messed with orders; getting some other item instead of what was ordered. And yes, cost is little on the higher side compared to other restaurants.PS: This review is for the branch they have opposite Mustafa on Syed Alwi Road. I am not sure if Kailash Parbat has any other branch in Singapore. I have seen there are reviews for Serangoon Road Branch as well, so they might have other branch there
4
We absolutely loved whatever we ordered here. We ordered a Sev Puri, a Kofta and Cheese Naan and everything was pretty tasty and served promptly. The place was bustling with people and so a tad noisy but food was quite alright. The chef was also careful enough when we ordered Chhole Bhatture, he came in and said, sorry but the Chhole haven't turned out good tonight so its better we order something else. I appreciate that humane honesty a lot. For Indians seeking veg food or chaat in Singapore, this is the place to go! :
4
I think their food is good but their specialty to me chaats, oh the chola bhatura platter with paneer bhaturas are not to miss.
4
Nice Taste... As its international Brand.. Little Bit Costly.. But good in Taste. Taste chole bhature for special taste.
5
I've eaten at many Indian restaurants and this is by far the best for North Indian food. Have eaten there twice and excellent food both times. Their chaat especially stands out!
5
Excellent, hygienic Indian Food....especially pani poori is awesome...you can get both south and north Indian Food here...
4
i often crave for indian chats and paav bhaji, though this place is not best, but it is much better than what other places offer. definitely recommended for indian chats
4
The food was great, ranging from the chola bhatura to the basic naan sabzi. Lot of local Indians seem to eat at the place... It was a great meal in totality!
3
We visit this place quite frequently as part of the Little India grocery trip. I find the food to be good -- my usuals are Chana Bhatore, Dahi Puri & Lassi. Generally good -- however, I find the food quality and taste to be highly inconsistent, especially Bhatore can be oily at times. The service too is nothing to call out.Its also a bit of a struggle to manage baby chairs
3
Food Quality Was Okay not Awesome. The Price paid for the food was RIDICULOUSLY HIGHThe Service was a Nightmare, especially the way they bring food onto the table. When you go to a normal restaurant you will notice butlers / waiters bringing in food in a nice and clean tray, however in this restaurant you will notice a bunch of waiters / waitresses coming with a freaking attitude holding plates and bowls in dirty hands so here comes a question of hygiene. Not sure how other reviewers did not notice this. The lady who looked like an owner to me was polite enough to come and ask whether we received our food on time etc. but the overall experience at this restaurant was Awful. In addition to this, the area this restaurant is in, is the most horrible place.Will never every return here
3
First time went and had Jaipur Biryani. It was good. Second time went to other restaurant near Mustafa. Taste sucks. Tried chat platter. It was not very good. Heard great reviews and recommendations. However recently had food in a friends place catered Kailash parbat, it was great. Very inconsistent
4
It's a nice and cosy place for Indian vegetarian cuisine in Singapore. They have two outlets and both of them are in the city area. There is one outlet which is opposite the Mustafa Center Gate-2.Along side the signature Indian dishes, one can also look forward for sweets, chats (pani-puri, delhi chaat, samaosa, etc) which is usually fresh and delicious.The service is professional. The place however may seem to be little pricey. A sumptuous meal for 2 people can be around S$ 40-45
5
Nice food good quality pure vegetarian food to have.there are many restaurants but this one is best to try
4
In Little there are many many Indian restaurants to choose from. This one has good clean ambiance and good quality Indian vegetarian food. A bit pricey though.
4
Had north indian dinner twice. Taste is good but it is indeed expensive. Average dinner cost for 4 people is 70-80 SGD
4
This time, we stuck to what Kailash Parbat is famous for: Chat - pani puri, bhel puri, dahi puri, chole bhatura, and to end malai kulfi - all very good. Delighted with the savouries, service could be better.
4
It is a Indian restaurant in front of mustafer center.the food is very good specially the kabab platter , samosas, dahi papri, lassi , Jaipuri biryani , pain puri all the starters practically are very tasty . If u want to give a birthday party than the main branch on the main road is also very nice they have a sweet shop inside . In alla nice trea
4
KP you are doing fantastic job to fill pure veggie tummies like mine.. Everything is good, but one thing for sure you must look into is stinking paneer its not good really. I am a frequent visitor at Chennai. I dont expect typical stuff but panner is horrible plz plz look into this.I am here now 19 Sept to 24 sept for lunch and dinner only here. I am tasting all things its quite good except paneer
5
The food here is awesome. Heaven for Indians in Singapore. The place is quite clean and staff is courteous. Portions servings are enough for two. Little on the expensive side but we didnt mind it as everything compensated the high prices. The place is conveniently located on main road and is accessible easily through MRT (local singapore transport). Thumbs-up
5
Went for Saturday lunch with family and experience was good. Place seems very popular with families and restaurant was almost full.Service was prompt and staff courteous and accommodating with smiles. Or starters we ordered pani poori a typical north indian dish and it was fresh and tasty.Main course was Cheese and normal bhatoore (bread) with chick peas which is most popular dish at Kailash parbat. Schezwan noodles, Dal makhni and rice.All food were fresh, good portion size and tasty.For desert, we had Malai rabri and it was authentic.Cant fault either service or food. By the way, we ordered home delivery also that night and another good experience
5
We had dinner here on two consecutive days and we were glad that we found this restaurant. The food was delicious and hot. Typical Indian taste. The place has great ambience. But, the service sometimes is lacking but I think the food makes up for it! Great place to have a meal with family and friends
3
Restaurant has nice a ambience and a good food quality & taste.Avoid going at closing hours ,doing so who will be treated as you went there to eat for free.I belong to the same industry and its morally wrong to serve guest forcefully only because its a closing time
4
The little India restaurant has nice ambience and a good collection of chaats, breads and tawa based biryanis and vegetable dishes.
I personally like the Indian chinese dishes such as the gobi manchurian!
4
Located near Little India and Fareer Road MRT, has two branches.
Well known for indian food.
Good service and ambience
must visit
1
Never go; tasteless
waste of money & time; taste is not like North India
not for chat, not dinner. not even or sweet
4
We enjoyed the quality of food, the ambience and the friendly attitude of staff. The menu list is large and the quantities served are adequate.
5
Centrally located in Singapore little India this offers some best food options. Crowded in peak hours. Reservations are recommended prior visiting. Do try the moti choor lados as deserts.
Highly recommended for a great culinary experience to satisfy your taste buds
4
Nice and clean.. Indian vegetarian Restoran... Very good north Indian food..
I come here all the time every time I am in singapure. A lot of verity.. Price is also reasonable for this place..
3
Visited this resturant many times and did not have good experience, taste if food was inconsistent, sometimes ok sometimes not good, service is awful, seems employees are not paid enough or not trained enough.
One of the ok indian vegetarian in Singapore
5
One of the best pure vegetarian joint in Singapore, it's little pricy as compared to its peers but for the quality and portions they serve, I think it's worth it.
3
Kailash Parbat speciality is Main North Indian as well as snack dishes .It is generally well cooked & presented prompmptly .Indian Sweets are also available in the Restauarant.Restauarant Ambience & seating is well done . Size of portions in various dishes is rather meagre & just enough for two people which makes it a little costly. Also one has to carefully place order & recheck as there ia a chance of mixing orders 
4
This restaurant is right next to ferrer park mrt . . .The food that you find here can be compared to authentic indian food that you can find in india in top quality restaurants no matter which city you live in . . . the dal makhani is simply yum . . plz try it and you would want to go over and over again . . its a bit pricey thoug
5
There are many Indian restaurants in Singapore, almost every next door in little India you find one ! However Kailash Parbat brings something special! I love every item of its menu. Good quantity and overall value for money !!
4
we liked the huge variety of food there. Best dishes - Chole Bhatura. The Pav bhaji and Samosa chat are good too
5
Cannot complaint about this restaurant at all. Taste of all the dishes are excellent and Service was good as well. Best Choice for Vegetarian.
5
I have visited this place many time. Very good in terms of variety, quality and consistency.
Staff is friendly and food is not very expensive.
4
Situated right outside Mustafa centre, this is a nice indian restaurant located in little India. offers good variety of mouth watering delicacies at reasonable prices. usually is full and one may have to wait for turn to get a place to get seated to enjoy the food here
5
We head to this place in Little India (Singapore) after reading good reviews about this restaurant at various sites and i must say that "Kailash Parbat" didn't disappoint us at all. They serve good quality food with awesome taste which i can call very authentic as well and at quite reasonable price. They have a very nice ambience although and serve almost everything you desire for from an Indian vegetarian restaurant right from chaats to main course dishes with delectable breads (almost all varieties except missi roti which is my husband's favourite) to desserts . Their quantity is good too.We tried their kadhai paneer with tandoori roti there and it was delicious. Later we also had their ras malai which was good too. Next day we tried their gol gappas and dahi bhalla chaat which was delicious as well. Their staff is nice and converse in Hindi & English both which makes you feel that you are sitting in a restaurant in India :). They have two branches in Little India and both of them are very well connected to MRT .We would highly recommend this place as a must visit for anyone craving for delicious and hygienic Indian Vegetarian Food
5
This is a small restaurant of the famous Kailash Parbat chain located in Little India. Staff is very courteous and polite. Most of them are Indian and speak Hindi. Food is great and for a moment you feel as if you are eating in India only. Must visit if you want good indian food. They also serve Jain Food
2
We had a visitor from Europe and my cousin suggested we take him to this place. It was nothing to shout about. Went back again to their other branch with my spouse. The visit just reconfirmed first impression. There is nothing special. It is good for people who want vegetarian food for nostalgic reasons. I would definitely give it a miss. Staff very helpful and friendly
4
Kailsah parbat is one safe place to fall back to when you want excellent spicy traditional north indian food. We have been there couple of times to have food and sometimes just to satisfy the craving for gol gappe. The starters as well as chat is very yum. No wonder the place is always crowded
3
Its a good veg restaurant. Been there many times. Their sweets are must to have. I always go there during ganesh puja time. As they make the mawa sweets. Tasty. Service is good but sometime it gets very crowded and need to wait for very long.
4
Just opposite to Grand Imperial hotel, nice, cozy with very good seating arrangement, serving Indian food. They serve in good quantity. Quality is also superb.. Taste is OK.
4
Good :
We ordered Indian/Chinese here and all the items very good. All staff is Indian and served us in very professional manner
Bad:
Very expensive
5
all chats and north indian food is available at kailsh parbat..we cant miss Indian food in singapore...nice restaurent
3
This joint is located in busy area of Little India. It is famous for Indian fast food & sweets. Only veg items are available. It is expensive with regard to the food quality, service & ambience.
5
Food:
Great curries. Very North Indian focused but lots of Chaat on the menu too. The curries are deep and flavourful. Quite rich but very tasty.
Service:
Reasonable but not amazing.
Value:
It's slightly pricey but it's worth the money...
2
A very average experience. They serve good quality food with a very low quality of service. The food is a bit over priced and they even charge for onion seperatly. The waiters are not warm and welcoming during the serve. Whereas the other indian restrnts in the neigbhrhood are much better.
3
i visited this restaurant after going through reviews on trip advisor but hugely disappointed by there service. It took more than 20 minutes to get the order. Even a small request of providing plastic plate for my kid took them 15 minutes.the place is clean and can cater upto 40 to 50 guests at one go, but they have only ONE CHEF (as told by there staff to me) so if you are a a big family avoid this place because your order will take lot of time.The food was better than average, nothing I can complaint about the quality of food. but the service is awful I suggest the owner/manager of the kailash part to look into there service part as tasty food alone cannot help you build a reputation
5
On my 4th visit I finally decide to write this review. I'm a non veg eater but this venue really impresses me and also my friends. Food: Every option is perfectly made. Such large variety to choose from. I've never eaten anything I didn't enjoy so I know the other 80% of menu will be tasty. Service: This has been acceptable. They try to come across and upmarket service but it gets so busy and staff just do a simple job. They have these iPad minis to take our orders down. So the owner is moving forward. There was even this nice aunty clearing tables often. Nice. Atmosphere: it's not fine dining. Not definitely not casual. It's perfectly in between. Nice chairs and tables. Clever paper place mats. Deseert sweets on display as you enter. Pleasant water features. Round tables. Can cater for large groups. Next door us events room. Huge kids party was taking place. Mostly busy so makes one feel the place is well liked and not just a tourist spot like some racecourse road venues. Cleanliness: the restuarant was clean. But bathroom area next door needed more attention. As said. Just busy place. Still easy to wash hands before and after dinner. I recommend to enjoy the food with your clean hands. Overall: I will always come here for my veg foods knowing it's reliable. My vegetarian guests were impressed with the food, venue and pricing was reasonable.
5
We ate dinner 3 to 4 times here. It was always quite crowded. The service is slow. However, the food was great. The Sindhi chappati were soft . They helped us by making the lasunibdaal less spicy .the choke bhatura was a delight. The pani puris are expensive but yummy. The mhich Di was uninspired and mehakta basmati rice was a bit oily. Gulabjamuns were spot on Dinner is after 7 only. Overall like eating back home in Mumbai and a definite must for the Vegetarian Indian traveller. The restaurant was right behind the Park Royal hotel at Farrer park where we were staying and definitely a great place to eat. it is expensive but less than a five star hotel and with more variety
4
For a gujarati vegetarian in Singapore this place is like heaven. Variety of food options and some pretty good chats.If you like cholle bhature, you should try the different variety of bhaturas served here. You would not find it at many places even in India.The staff is usually slow specially during the rush hours, so have some time on your hand when you visit the place.Overall food is good, but expensive
5
We enjoyed some real Gujju novelties at this place. Not a place if you are on a tight budget. 2 people bills will easily touch SGD50. Though taste and hygiene is of top quality.
4
I was impressed that they had a separate menu for Jain Food to suit my requirements. Very tasty North Indian food, and decent service, though occasionally lackadaisical. Yet, went there quite a few times during my 5 month stay and was not too disappointed.
5
This place will not let you miss your Indian Food. You will get the best quality indian food here. This restaurant is in the market area. a bit costly worth the money. Must try!!!!
3
Nice Ambience and nearby hotels. Some dishes are good but some are recooked. I had bad experience of Samosa. Dripping in oil. Avoid it.
4
food quality was finger licking, one can get the variety of indian food as available in india....... but little overpriced.
4
They have turned down the heat of Indian Cuisine to serve the locals. Should improve their quality of Indian tandoors that they serve. Gravies are good, salads are awesome and the best is mango lassi.
5
Visited this restaurant 2-3 times during my two month long visit to Singapore. It is a fantastic place for enjoying Indian food. Variety of vegetarian food is available i.e. North Indian, Gujarati, Jain food. Ambiance is very good. Once should not miss a visit to this place when in Singapore. Service is prompt. Tourists are welcomed with a smile by the staff
5
The Ambiance was good , with lots of space and light . The tables were placed with good distance between them and comfortable . We started with the chats which was really awesome and one of the best chats I have tasted. The main course was great as well .
4
This is simply the best Indian vegetarian restaurant that you'll find in Singapore. Cost wise, it's $50-60 for 2 people on an average. The Dal Makhani is the best here. So is Aloo Tuk/ Arbi Tuk. Been here at least 20 times. Be assured of good food. The one opposite Mustafa is usually crowded on weekend evenings
5
We were a group of 6 people visiting Kailash Parbat opposite Mustafa center. This was my First visit to this outlet. I have visited the other one near to temple on many occasions. We tried mix of Indian & chinese dishes. The munchow soup was really very very tasty. It had the right mix of hot & sour taste. After long time i had such a good soup in Singapore. In the main course we ordered paneer gravy, hyderabadi biryani and mix of roti & naan. They were all cooked very nicely. He staff was very helpful. One of us even got their mobile phone charged while we were having the meal. Our requests for hot water, pickle etc were well looked after. I also found the staff interacting with some customers who seemed to be regular on the table next to us in a very friendly manner. All my visits to Kailash Parbat have been very satisfying. I am sure to visit this place again. The munchow soup is highly recommended.
3
Spent around 2 hours... the food was well cooked and tasty. The ambiance was good and it was not expensive. Had the feeling of India...
4
I loved the food options - and with my love for Indian food this was a great place for the lunch choice.
You might have a wait for a while in the rush hours. However, its worth the wait.
5
This Indian restaurant serves very good and authentic Indian food. The quality of the food is very good and the taste is amazing.
The ambiance of the restaurant is also very good and is located well within the city.
5
This is a vegetarian restaurant, and this is a very good place if you want to have a taste of chats and north Indian food. Whenever I visit Singapore, I always visit this place.
4
This restaurant is an upmarket vegetarian restaurant famous for its chaats with good service.Popular place,so seating might be an issue on crowded days.
4
One of the best vegetarian food in SG with great taste. My family often visit branch in front of Mustafa, Little India.Staff is friendly and remember us. Service is also good. Customization in food possible on request.Chaat and Chole Bhature are very famous. But nowadays Bhature's are very oily.We generally order Three Pepper Paneer, Chaat Platter, Indo-Chinese dishes, Thai Green Curry and Mango LassiLittle overpriced, but "okay" because of fine taste.Highly recommended for vegetarians specially branch near Mustafa
3
The place serves authentic Indian chaat. The taste was just like what you are served in India. So if you happen to visit Mustafa Shopping centre and want to splurge on Indian food the Kailash Parbat is a good option. The Cholley Bhatura are authentic so is the Chaat
4
For a long time me & my family wanted to have chaat from Kailash Parbat. We tried paani puri & Kailash Parbat chaat platter. The platter had 4 different chaats. The quantity was good enough for 2 people to share. Infact 2 of us & our 6 years daughter could not finish all the chats along with paani puri. If I remember the 4 chaats in the platter they were bhel puri, paapdi chaat, Dahi bhalla and shev puri. The taste was good. The combination of spices, puris and tomatoes & carrots was well balanced. I remember trying one of the chaat at nearby shop named Bikanerwala. It was not at all up to the expectation. Coming back to chaat from Kailash Parbat, paani puri was a bit of letdown for us. They server puri stuffed with potatoes and the water separately. We had to mix it before eating. In my opinion the paani is the heart & soul of paani puri which adds the tangy, sweet & spicy flavor to it. It was missing. Next time for sure I will give a miss to paani puri. Definitely the chaats which I have tied previously & the platter on this occasion are much better. If you are coming to expect the same taste as the chaats that you get in Mumbai or Goa where I come from, you might be little disappointed. We are used to a bit more tangy & spicy chaats. But other places where I have tried chaats they are similar to the ones available in Singapore in terms of taste & ingredients. If you are a chaat lover give a try for different chaats available in Kailash Parbat. I am sure i will visit this place again for chaats in future.
4
We visited few times Belilios lane one. Few days back my friend came from Japan it happened to visit infront of Mustafa one. We like the Ragada Sev Puri its very tasty. The Chaas was very good. The Hyderabadi Biryani loved it.The over all, the place is good for chaat and vegetarian food. The price wise its above average compare to other restuarants in that area
3
I have always heard great reviews from people about the restaurant. But when I went there, I was not very impressed. The food was fine though I would say nothing special. On the other hand, the ambience of the restaurant was very nice. I felt that the prices of the food there were exorbitant
5
Best hotel !!excellent food....u will feel u r eating in india......!!! Must visit good service good food.
5
My favorite Indian restaurant! We usually will order bel poori and pani poori! Good food and very affordable!
Located near Mustafa Shopping Centre.
3
Good North Indian Joint in Singapore
Chaat items and Chole Bhatura, especially Masala Bhatura is very tasty
There are variety of sweets available as well.
They are slightly costly but a good fine dine option

This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore... v always celebrate our birthdays n anniversary here... from chats to main course to their kulfi.. everythin is amazing!!! Highly recommended !!!

A really good place to have North Indian Food in Little India, Singapore. Went their once and then started ordering for home delivery for lunch at my clients place at orchard road.
5
With my family here. Service available even at 11 pm Saturday night and the place is full house and more are waiting. Great food and equally good service. Prices are at par with similar Indian restaurants in the area. Will be back.
4
Kailash Parbat is right on the junction of Syed Alwi Road in Little India. Its the best place around for North Indian food. Do try Chole Bhature if you are there. The menu is good with a decent spread across Indian Snacks and Main Course. A pure veg restaurant, decently priced and good seating space. Masala tea is rocking :). During our 5 nights stay in Parkroyal on Kitchener road, this was our first go-to place for Dinner
4
If you are a pure vegetarian or looking for authentic north Indian vegetarian food during your trip to Singapore your search ends here. Service is quick, food is delicious and staff doesn't resort to rules to say 'no' as is pretty evident elsewhere in the city. Restaurant is air-conditioned and ambiance is just fine. For a sumptuous north Indian we paid around 90-100 SD for 5 adults so quite a value for money
4
On a recent trip to singapore i discovered KP as i call it and had to visit and check out the Chaats.We went to the one opposite Mustafa store as it was easy to park in Mustafa. We got a table straight away. We ordered starters of Dahi Batata Puri, Ragda patties and Hara Bhara Kabab.All of the them were well made. The patties was very big.Followed by North Indian main meal which was Chole bhatura, navratan karma and some paneer sabzi. Nice food. Worth a visit if you are in the mood for Chaat
3
The address given on tripadvisor is wrong. As far as the Restaurent is concerned it's pure veg and the food is not bad, but it's other branch (10 mins walk from this branch) is much better.If you decide to eat here, try Chholw Bhature, Pani Puri, Samosa Chaat, Dahi Bhalla, Sev Puri and Bhel puri in that order of preference. Apple mint and lassi are good as drinks. Desserts are not great
4
Highly recommended for chats. But the main course was a mixed bag . Sabzee was not Upto the mark . Briyani was tasty . Worth a visit for chats
4
Loved the Chole Bhature, relaxed in the slightly dim and wooden furniture ambience and of course a Hind speaking concierge from Jharkhand!!
Please visit this atleast once..Jai Hind!!
4
Kailash Parbat is a very popular restaurant and people may have to wait to get seated. However, the wait is worth it since the food is authentic north indian food. Good main courses and desserts.
4
Chola Bhatura and similar snacks offered by this restaurant are quite nice. The interiors were nice. Best part was it is adjoining to the Grand Chancellor hotel where we stayed
5
Very good and tasty Indian food. Staff is very fast and efficient. I had lunch and dined at this hotel most of the times....At this hotel you dont miss India and India food. A very good vegeterian option.
4
We often visit KP at Serangoon road (next to the indian temple between little India and farrer park MRT). This outlet is better than the one opposite mustafa in terms of ambience, quality, taste and quantity served.They serve great chat items (although only half as good as in India, but best in Singapore). Start with Pani Puri. You will love Samosa Chat. Get Apple mint juice. The best on the menu is Chhole Bhature... Different varieties of it... All are good. Tastes great with chilly and onion. After this you can try Sev Puri, Dahi Bhalla and Bhel Puri in that order. Lassi isNot bad too.Sweets / Desserts are not so great. They are not bad, but you can find better other places in SingaporeDon't miss the (free) mukhvaas/ mouth freshener upon exit
5
When you eat here, you don't miss India and that includes:1. Taste of the chaat and other food; they have retained the flavors2. Service is as good as you find in their Indian counterparts, which means that you will at times wonder where are the guys and gals who are supposed to take the order to serve3. Chole Bhature were excellent, you run 2 marathons the next day to compensat
5
4 of us had a 3 course meal for less than 60 SGD. The location is great, right Opposite Mustafa Centre. There are also number of Indian restaurants around there are only a few that are 100% Vegetarian. We tried Chilly Milly accompanied with tandoori tokri that different varieties of roti; both were excellent and recommended by staff
3
Had lunch here on recommendations of a few friends. On ask in the waiter for the specials, he insisted all the items were special. Either he did not know what a special was or there wasn't one in the first place. The food was generally very good. We wanted to try Sindhi food and since our waiter wasn't particularly helpful we ordered foods with Sindhi on its name. Eat here if you know which Sindhi food you want to try out
5
Excellent food - with SO MANY options! There is something for everyone - from spicy Indian food (chaat, etc.) to classic, but very tasty, Western food (sandwiches)! Fast and wonderful service - everyone is always so happy to serve us. Not too expensive and absolute value for money! Brilliant
4
Needless to say, if you want to have Chat items having same taste of India, you must have your supper / dinner at Kailash Parbat. Yummy chat items are really mouth watering.
5
Great food, especially the khichdi is really nice. Hare Bhare kebabs are one of my favorites, Ambiance is also nice for dine in.
5
Surprised to get the exact indian food in Singapore!! It made my trip so relaxed! Chat, Chinese, punjabi, u name it n its there! Awesome food! Great location! Right opposite our hotel grand chancellor, truly a bliss!
4
Being a vegetarian and Indian, my first choice was Kailash Parbat and I was quite satisfied with its food quality and taste. Pure Veg food and typically for Indians. U get good quality Punjabi food and other Indian food as well.
3
Our son recommended this outlet for chaat. We ordered a chaat platter, which was excellent. That is what it is good at and one should stick to that.We saw a promo of the week on our table - Punjabi Dhaba at lunch. We greedily went for 'sarson ka saag' (mustard spinach) with 'makai ki roti' (corn bread) & gajar ka halwa (carrot dessert) and lassi.I mentioned to our son that the Punjabi Dhaba was a failure. His immediate response was, 'you failed falling for Punjabi food in a Bombay savoury (chaat) house. Sure our fault. The stuff was not fit for human consumption - Yucky. The service staff was friendly but casual. Chaat very good to excellent, it gets average on account of poor Dhaba
5
I visited kailash parbat restaurant on serangoon road Singapore with my kid who does not eat spicy food. The restaurant was able to customise their menu to suit his taste. We took him there twice thereafter. The ambience is clean and hygienic. The food is tasty and they have very good options within Indian food. Kailash parbat is famous for its chat but I didn't try that. I tried North Indian and it was good. The staff is helpful and able to comprehend our needs.
3
We were craving for chaat. Our son recommended we try their recent one opened at Syed Alwi Road. Chaat platter covered everything we needed and salted lassi - was just right.We were tempted by a promotion, which the waiter said was for just this week at Mon to Fri lunch only - Punjabi Dhaaba - Sarson ka saag with makai di roti. That was a disaster!I messaged my son - chaat was very good but saag roti failed! His reply. "You failed for having fallen for it in a Bombay chaat house".My response, "I should have known better, they had a disclaimer on the picture on the table promo 'presentation only for illustration purposes'. Saag seemed canned and makai roti mixed with white flour - not fit for human consumption. We should have stuck to chaat
4
Finding good Indian Veg Food in Singapore can be a tedious job. Out of 3-4 restaurants we tried, we find this restaurant better than others. Quality wise n quantity wise if you are 3-4 persons then you can have tummy full dinner or lunch along with Pani poori or chaat within 100 SD ,above all no extra charges for home delivery if ordered from anywhere in Singapore.One can visit little India and nearby places but the strong smell of other food varieties might have confined our search for other outlets. Once finalized we relied on this and had home delivery thus saved to n fro taxi charges.Therefore one must rely on personal instincts before jumping to any exclusive conclusion
5
When u r Out of india for Holidays its very hard to find Pure Veg Indian Food with our original indian taste, but in singapore i m surprised by getting a best Food with Yummy Taste for Veg lovers at Kailash Parbat in little india,Ambience is healthy, staff was very polite with excellent service, specially manager CHANDRA DAS & waiter paras Was very friendly to customers with always Big Smile on there Face,FOOD WAS SIMPLY AMAZING,Specially authentic Choole Bhature was Very tasty , All mumbai chaats like pani puri, Sev Puri, Papdi chaat are nice, Daal Khichdi, jeera Rice, Dal Makhni was Supperrb, chili mili Paneer Sabji was Best, Masala Chaas, Sweets- gulab jamun, Rabdi, Ladoo was good,MUST FOR ALL INDIANS PURE VEG FOODIE WHO VISIT TO LITTLE INDIA IN SINGAPORE..
5
I was here with my family on my Diwali vacation. we had gone four time to the same restaurant for our indian veg. food. It was best in Indian test and the chaat was awesome.we really enjoyed a all our meals and thanks to the helping staff. The ambiance is average and it was clean. On our special request the chef and cooked non spicy food for children and we are glad to them. located opposite to mustufa center
5
The menu has quite a bit of variety.we tried north Indian food and also chaat like bhel.sevpuri.etc. the beverages like lassi.juices etc.the food was good.and reasonably priced.the place is bang opposite mustafa mall.very hygienic.
5
Must visit,and a real life saver for a foodie,for niche veg food,full course meals.I'm eating here for last 3 days and I n awed by such delicious food
4
Good atmosphere with mainly Indian families. Staff were helpful and good. Really enjoyed the food and would recommend to people especially vegetarians.
5
Hotel has 3 branches in the serangoon road, staff are very courteous those miss north indian home food can hop on to this hotel. fantastic taste and a clean environment, please try butter nan and paneer butter masala without fail :)
4
Went there with my friend and ordered a chat combo kind if thing, with pani puri and lassi. The taste was really great for all dishes. The pani puri pani was not that great. We gave this feedback and was very well accepted.
Recommended!

Set right in the heart of Little India, kailash parbat is one of the better upmarket restaurants. I dined there a couple of times(2 lunches and 1 dinner to be precise) and the food always blew me away. It's a vegetarian restaurant so don't expect to have tangri and kebabs at this place. The ambience is good, prices are okay too but what sucks the most is the cust service. The waiters are rude, don't repeat the orders and seem uninterested in doing their jobs. We still kept going to the same place as we were dead tired after our visits everyday and did not want to experiment. P.S. - Avoid the chaat here. Not worth it
3
Went to Kailash Parbat once after moving to Singapore. The food was just about average. Not as good as what you get at Kailash Parbat in India. However the food here is really costly. The staff is helpful but there is definitely hygiene issue, place can do with some cleaning and same goes for cutlery. Expensive compared to other Indian restaurants in the area
4
We happened to be in this chain's outlet in Syed Alwi Road this weekend, which was not planned for, but just stepped in. The staff were prompt to attend to us as well as offered us better seating as soon as there was one vacant, as the restaurant was quite packed. The food tasted great, we tried new combinations like Diwani Handi, Hariyali Naan. It's priced a bit on the higher side; maybe they also need to improve on acoustics of the seating area as it seems to be noisy if people around start to talk a lot..overall we enjoyed the food, the ambiance, above all the prompt fast service in spite of the flow of guest
4
Ate here a couple of times.Highly recommend to try out :-1. Gulab jamun on a bed of Rabri2. Paneer (cheese) Batura y Chole3. Ras Malai4. Bhelpuri.The place has no ambience. Went to wash hands..wash basin was dirty. The waiters are always in a hurry in a bid to make you empty your table as soon as one has finished eating.Prices, quite reasonable.Do I recommend? yes, especially for the deserts.Will I return? Yes, most definitely
3
Been here once for dine in and once home delivery. Evrything we had, tastes avegrage nothing special. Service just average. Lot of paneer(cottage cheese) options in the menu and, all paneer dishes tastes almost same. Too many spices in everything. Chaats are not bad but again, nothing special. Puri for pani puri could be alot better. I would only recommend their chana bhatura which actully tastes good
4
Good ambience and the food was amazing. Best samosa chaat and dahi puri i have ever had.
but it was too expensive.
5
fresh and tasty food. good portion size. friendly staff. dahi puri has now become my personal favourites among the chaats, pani-puri and papdi chaat is also nice. excellent ambience. hygenic and clean.
5
Kailash parbat is known for its yummy chats. We tried twice on its outlet opposite mustafa centre, it was indeed delicious. Chat platter is highly recommended, they give 4 varities in platter.Also their must try is Chole bhatoore and Malai Rabri. Rabri is excellent and fresh.Worth a visit with family for quick snacks
4
I have visited Kailash Parbat on multiple occassions with famly, friends during different times like lunch, evening snacks and dinner. the ambience is very good here compared to many other restaurants in the surrounding areas. The service is also good. The place is nice and clean.They have the chats as well as regular ala carte menu. The staff is helpful. Once I wanted to order a Sindhi dish and the waiter was good enough to suggest that it is very spicy an unless I really wanted to give it a try, I should stay away from it.I have tried chats here. They are good. You cannot compare them with what is available in places like Goa & Mumbai. But they are one of the best in Singapore. The quantity is good. There was only one instance when I went for a dinner just before diwali and felt the service was impacted. Probably it was too crowded. Inspite of asking the waiter to serve the soup after finishing the chat, somehow soup ended on the table before the chat was served. The reason given was the chat counter was too busy and our order was still being served.I would definitely recommend this place for those people who are pure vegetarians. If you want to spend a quite evening without being disturbed in the crowded little India side, this place is good
2
After reading good reviews and upon being suggested by a friend, went here for dinner. What followed was terrible .First up - The ambience is very good for an Indian restaurant in Singapore. Service is reasonably fast and efficient. That's where the good part ends. Now coming to food, we ordered Pani poori - very averageTikki chaat - terrible Pav Baaji - reasonably goodThai noodles -Had so much oil that you can cook for entire week for 1 person and very spicyBiryani - spicyMango lassi - reasonably goodWill never visit again
5
We returned to this little haven on a hot day. What a great place to call in for a snack, cold drink or full on main meal pigout. The food is top quality, service is amazing and even the decor is streets above all the other indian restaurants in Little India. The Chaat is just so fresh and the drinks are works of art. Price is very reasonable
5
Undoubtedly best vegetarian restaurant in Singapore.Restaurant is bit expensive but the helpings are large.Ambience:Very GoodService: Very Good. Staff is courteous. Must Try:Starters: Kailash club special sandwich, Chaat items like Bhel and Paani puri Drink: Sweet LassiMain Course: Hyderabad BiryaniNote: Avoid Sundays because of crowd in Little India
2
Not sure if I say poor would be fair but to my surprise it was poor at least what we ordered was not tasty at all, happened to visit kailash parbar in syed alvi road singapore in the evening on a weekday, ordered pani puri and it was awful to the core, its meant to be good for chats but I felt like I was eating plastic puris they were that hard I could feel they were not fresh at all they were literally like plastic, and the taste wasn't good, I couldn't chew in my mouth coz it wasn't even breaking it was that hard some weird taste, decided I will never eat pani puri ever in this place again, but I am assuming other dishes and roti currys will be good as they are served all day.Wouldn't recommend for pani puri at al
5
We live in Singapore and love Kailash Parbat. Their chats specially the Pani Puri are amazing other than the Pani Puri we will often indulge in their mouth watering Bhel puri, Samosa Chat or Alu Chat as a snack. The Chilly Paneer is also a special favourite.The helpings are large so you should share your food so that you get to taste a variety of their delicate chats and sweets. Wash it down with a cool lassi or lime juice or lime soda and that's what I would call a lovely indian snack.Meals at Kailash Parbat are excellent too and if you have the time do take the time to enjoy a good meal at Little India. The have a new outlet in the works at Changi coming up soon
5
The kofta dilbahar is excellent among the subzis. The chaats are very good too. No South Indian fare though. Bhel puri and pani puri as well as corn basket chaat are very nice. It could get very crowded sometimes. Food a little on the spicy side.
5
The restaurant provides very good Indian food starting from chaats to paneer sabzi and biryani. It may seem a little costly but the food is really worth it. The ambience is also very good.
3
The food was amazing, but service was "different": when we asked the waitress what side order she would take, she answered, none, I don't like the food in this restaurant..
4
We went there for lunch.. Great staff, nice food, but a bit expensive for international travellers. Since we were twelve of us, it did not seem as expensive as it actually is..
4
You name it and there! You have the tongue titilling, very nicely presented food ranging from Pani Puri to Pav Bhaji.
There is a College Sandwich which sure would remind you of your college cafe's. Tastes really nice.
4
Excellent quality food.
Great staff very helpful.
Price is decent.
Best food....has been always amazing.
Highly recommended.....
4
The food was simply awesome. So was the variety. but had to pay a good price for that.. The Ambiance of the restaurant was excellent.. was very clean.. the Staff was good.. service was good.. but Slow.. Should try Chole Bhature Platter.. Maybe on of their specialties.. and if u are looking for Indian Snacks.. This place is your choice
4
Me and my husband visited kailash parbat in Little India for dinner. The moment we entered it gave us an Indian feel. I felt like i am in mumbai and am having dinner. Usually the service in kailash parbat is slow .... I am saying this out of experience .. and the same thing was here .but the food was yummy .. we had a hearty meal and enjoyed it to the core. Highly recommended to all chaat lovers and punjabi food lovers ..
5
It had been more than a week of searching to find a perfect restaurant with good ambience , cleanliness and hospitality at par .The Search eneded at Kailash Parbat , we reached a bit early at 19:00 Hrs recomended as it becomes really busy post 20:00 Hrs .A Perfect Host , good service with a smile . The Food is hygenic , freshly cooked and tastes yummm . Its more of soul filling than stomach filling .We took some motichoor ladoos as well they were by far the best what I found in Singapore .If you are looking for a cheap deal this not a place for you but if you are looking for value for money then certainly a must visit .Above All the Sindhi Delicacies were a Santa coming front of us 
3
This is one expensive restaurant in little India , to pay s$ 160 for food for four person is very expensive for an average restaurant. That's more than what one pay for 5 star hotel in India. Food is okay , their chats are good . Service is not like upmarket restaurant. overall avoid if have less budget for a restaurant
1
We visited this restaurant on 13 May 14 at around 2100 Hrs, We went to its branch at Kailash Parbat Restaurant, 93 Syed Alwi Road, Singapore 207669 for dinner and ordered a platter of Chhola Bhattura, Hyderabdi biryani and plain yoghurt.To the worst of our experience, when we just started eating and had half a bhattura,in chhola curry I found a big dead cockroach. We reported the same to restaurant manager and he had no explanation other than just sorry. It was a major hygiene issue and even I had starting symptoms of mouth ulcer after that food.Me and my family were really very very upset with the incident as we are pure vegeterian and could not have food that night. My 6 year old daughter slept hungry that night. It spoiled our night and my daughter could not have food properly throughout the stay in Singapore in any of the restaurant due to the same suspicion.We reported the incident to the hotel admin (Mr Amit on admin@kailashparbat.com.sg sales@kailashparbat.com.sg) that night itself but his response was again just a sorry. Terrible restaurant and average food....
5
dahi papdi chat and the pani puri served in Singapore branch was at par with any other branches in india. Chass served here is also great and reminds you that whether you are having your dinner in India or singapore.
4
Excellent quality food.
Great ambience
Great staff very helpful and kind
Price is decent
I will say must for anyone looking out for indian food at little india
4
Like I had reviewed for MTR as one of the best South Indian Vegetarian place, this is the best place for North Indian food. Like MTR, this place is also on expensive side, but the ambience is better.
5
Best food.... Has been always Amazing experience... Would definately go again n again... Highly recommended...
3
Went back to Kailash Parbat recently, wanting to have chats for Sunday brunch. While good and consistent food taste wise, I do think that they need to rethink their pricing a little bit. 13-15$ for a vegetable dish, 3-4$ for a cup of instant coffee and 8$ for a small serving of Kulfi probably pushes it a little bit. We tried their signature Chola Bhatura, and it is a stand out good dish. Their shahi dum aloo left a lot to be desired - chaat items are consistent as always and service was good all around
4
Food is good, however it takes a while for your food to be served, quite expensive compared to other restaurants near by! however have to admit the Chat's were nice. and the food portion is quite small, not recommended for big family!pricing is a little too high and the service staff tend to ignore your preferences if the restaurant is full
4
Had been struggling to find some north Indian food near orchard road and was advised to try this restaurant in little india. I can say it was a decision well made. The restaurant has courteous staff and decent hygiene. Normal dishes start at average of SGD 10 for main course and the menu has sizeable variety. Six of us spend around 100 SGD for main course but the food was good so didn't mind paying that much. Getting there from orchard road took about 10 minutes and its well connected by MRT. Overall a good place to eat and yes they also deliver at home..
5
What more on a holiday could you ask for than good food.!!.. for all veg indian food lovers this place is a must visit in singapore. if you are missing indian food and want to get full with great food this is a place. Great service by the staff. Excellent job they do especially at weekend evening when there is Hours of waiting. But still they get you served asap. Well do not miss it if you like chaat and other indian snaks. everything they prepare has Indian essence and is amazing. 10 on 10 :
4
We went to this place on two consecutive days. On First day we wanted to order some chinese dishes, But the manager declined saying that Chinese Chef was absent. Next day the chinese chef was there. All the items there were good. Starters, Main Course and Chinese dishes all were very good. Service was a touch slow but still nice place to have authentic Indian cuisine
4
I have been there just once and will never go back, I had visited during dinner on a weekday, but the service staff was too slow, there was not much of crowd too.We have to remind the service staff about our order as they are a bit forgetful.Recommended but only visit this restaurant if you have ample time to spen
5
the best advantage about this restaurant is that it is just in front of hotel grand chancellor where we stayed in singapore.the food is good but the price value is too high.
5
Sandwiches and bhatura are awesome and out of the world..
Very tasty...and not expensive according to the ambience
4
Excellent Indian food, never disappointing. Prices are slightly expensive, but we dont mind as food quality is amazing. We are regular customers here
4
Though the food and service was very good. The prices were steep as compared to nearby Indian restaurants.
5
The best veg indian restaurant in little india with a wide variety of food and a cozy ambience. The staff is suggestive and friendly. Great place to visit for chaats. They also the an impressive range of mocktails. Would surely visit again with friends and family in the next trip to Singapore
3
It's one of the few places in Singapore that offers a considerable variety of chaat and by virtue of that, has good awareness here. However, both the food and service are pretty inconsistent - could be great one day and a downer the next. Their Chole Bhatura is probably the only dish that I've found to be good every single time I've had it. What they call Hyderabadi Biryani is more like Mint-Coriander rice, and their Paneer Khurchan is a heavily gravied dish, which shouldn't be the case.This branch is still okay but the one opposite Mustafa is a disaster. The staff is not receptive to feedback at all and can be quite indifferent and rude about it - maybe one of the reasons they don't offer a survey
3
I went to Kailash Parbat thinking that I will get authentic Mumbai chaat; however, was slight disappointment. The food taste was quite contrast from what is offered in India. Also, the portions where inconsistent. Further, the variety of chaat in menu card was limited. Overall, an average experience. Maybe due to the brand name, I had high hopes. For people who want to enjoy Mumbai chaat, this is place to go provided you are able to manage your expectations
1
We have been going to Kailash parvat a number of times since they have opened. However, the quality of food especially in this outlet (Grand Chancellor Hotel) has been on a declining trend ever since! The last we went there was last week - 2 April and after that we have sworn it off our list!For starters we ordered pani puri - which had a stale smell like the oil used to fry it was old. When we pointed it out the staff, his answer was - "No one else has said that, so you are wrong"Secondly, we ordered food without onions and garlic and sure enough the food arrives with big pieces of onion. Thankfully it was big enough to be visible to the staff as well so he could not say that we are delusional! Without getting into too many details, the staff's attitude despite this mistake was very arrogant. The manager came in after 10 mins of argument with the staff and after being repeatedly asked for. Although his attitude was much better, the damage was done and could not be redeemed. We paid for our hardly eaten food and left immediately.While Kailash Parbat is off our list, I do know quite a few restaurants now that offer much better food minus the attitude. Try Komala Vilas in Race course road for pure veg food or Bikanerwala, Raj or Bombay cafe for better chaat options
5
Nice venue, excellent service and great value. The maitre'd came to our table and explained the slight delay as one of the dishes we had ordered, the Kebab Platter, was being freshly made, but it was well worth the wait. I cannot fault any of the dishes and generous helpings too. In fact so much so that we had to put in takeaway containers and had for lunch the next day, delicious even cold. I also enjoyed the Mango Lassi. Defintely recommend Kailash Parbat Restaurant in Little India
4
Situated in little india, this 'vegeterian' resturant is an ultimate place to satisfy your taste buds!With a very vast menu and varity of cusines, the starters will make your tongue drooling. Specially the chaats are amazing.The main course might dissappoint you a little as compared to startes, but is again not at all a bad option to try.On weekends, there is a long queue so please book table in advance else be ready to wait. Service is slow given high rush of footfall, but they will keep your cool with their warm behaviour.Average meal for a couple costs SGD 30-40.In all, a must try for all vegetarians
5
have been to many resturants all over India but the taste of food i had at Kailash Parbat in Singapore is the best till now
5
Have been to this restaurant quite a lot of times and their food is tasty and up to the mark. Not to be missed are the Chaat platter, samosas and chola bhaturas. Great ambiance and great food!!!
5
Eating here since last two years. The quality of food has never varied. The chola bhatura are best in Singapore. So is the Mushroom corm club sandwich. Chat platter is good. Rest everything is upto mark. Ambience is of fine dining.
3
This is the restaurant outlet across from Mostaffa not the one of the main street. Bhel puri, chaat was good but the falooda was disappointing. Overall a clean restaurant and service was prompt. The mithai was good.
4
Hi Foodies, If you are looking for nice cozy environment to try Indian food in Singapore, then look no further. KP brings in authentic north Indian taste for you. Staff wears a smile and often give you freebie starters, of that you have to be a regular by the way ;)Chole Bhature, Baby Corn Basket Chaat and Biryanis are a much try. If you wish to have some thing light they do serve sandwiches and snacks through the day. The only down side is you may have to wait a bit during weekends to get a table. Keep hogging..:
3
We were in Little India on the evening of the Dec 2013 riots. Walking around the place in the evening, we were surprised by the poor quality of restaurants and eateries in Little India. Being a Sunday, it was crowded and thankfully we spotted this restaurant which is a reasonably well known chain from India. While its facade looks average, the place is very nice from inside with efficient service, good food and stands out as an oasis where one can have a good quality meal in a comfortable, safe ambiance. While not a good place by itself, it stands miles above its local competition. I would definitely recommend this place for lunch/dinner in Little India
3
Sindhi food is generally very unique and probably one of the best Indian option. But needs special culinary skills . KP though being Sindhi food, lacks altogether the Sindhi menu and Sindhi flavors. There are few options on the menu, but that is not what one would expect from such a restaurant.Even the least of Sindhi Paratha or Rajma or Sayal Bhaji is all missing.Overprices and is ok for perhaps one visit, till the restaurant gets all the sindhi dishes on the menu.Visited the one near the Mustafa this time, but have been to the Temple hugging one in the past. Both almost same
3
Found the place to be neat and clean. Decor is quite nice. And good location in Little India. Also good variety of chaat options if u are in the mood for something different from the usual meals or heavy snacks. but price wise it is on the expensive side. So if u are on a tight budget better check the menu before settling in
3
I believe this place has undergone some rapid change in staff, including the chef and manager. While the service staff are generally nice, the change in chef was a huge disappointment for a period of time. Food taste and quality went down drastically; to the extent that we thought that the food served was spoilt. Before that, I used to go down there almost every Saturday and Sunday for brunch. After a long hiatus, I decided to try them out a couple of days ago and I was pleasantly surprised that the food tastes really good now. I wish this consistency is maintained. Ambiance is quite good and the place is easy to locate. My suggestion is to try the restaurant neat the temple and not the one behind Mustafa

this place is very close to Mustafa on syed Alwi road. There are many other indian restaurant around. Place is generally full. Had dinner twice at this place. Excellent food. You can get many snacks items like bhel, sevpuri, gulab jamun, samosa, sandwich etc also along with the regular vegetarian items in a restaurant. Food - quality and taste wise is excellent. Service is excellent. Staff is great. we tried north indian food and really liked it.This restaurant is visited mostly by Indian tourist and Indians staying in Singapore

I was overwhelmed to see the branch of Mumbai's famous chain just opp to my hotel. Tasted Chhola Bhatura, Soup, Sindhi Curry and Malai Kulfi. Awsome authentic taste.

Going to Kailah Parbat for our meet-up was a wonderful suggestion from a non-vegetarian.
My first time here, I love the décor and ambience of the restaurant. We have a wonderful night chit-chatting and savouring the delicious vegetarian food here.

super duper service and fantastic food, good people. felt as if we were back home. had a good time with my family.....

We ordered for home delivery today...we wanted to eat paneer chilly from a very long time but we were totally disappointed...it was really stale and pathetic in taste.. With such highly priced food we didn't expect such disappointing dish..!!!
4
While visiting little India we happened to see the restaurant and went for dinner. The place is spacious and tables well laid out. We had sev puri and enjoyed it. Kids enjoyed the paneer dish with various types of rotis. Overall all of us enjoyed the food. Service was good but I felt it was a bit slow but the overall experience was goo

Amazing amazing food with amazing service...just can't stop myself repeating their chats, bhatura variety and grill sandwich..their service consistently impressed with the food and service. This place is affordable and delicious. I've taken large groups here and they handle it beautifully. We love that we live close enough to be repeat customers. The setting is very very royal and food is grea

We were looking for a good indian place to have a quick bite at around 11 in the morning in the Little India area and decided to visit this place, having seen it so many times from the bus. The first impression as we entered the restaurant was about the strange pungent smell that was there in the restaurant (might have been because it was quiet early in the day). This was to a point that we thought of leaving without eating.We did stay and ordered. We ordered 2 dishes, 'Bhel Puri' & 'Regular Batore', though we were served Dahi Puri instead of Bhel Puri (and I am not someone who sends things back, afterall we are there for the good time). The food did actually turn out quiet good. The Dahi Puri's flavor was a bit all over the place and the chutneys and sweet yogurt didnt complement each other too well. The Batoore were a total treat. We loved it. Though we may not go back to this place (despite of the good food) because of the whole smell in the place

I liked the ambiance of the place when i was just returning back form Mustafa i saw this and thought give it a try... I just had a Bhatura but tell frankly could not finish it... The only problem i faced was they did not accept travel card saying they accept only on bills above SGD 20 or more and my bill was SGD16.80.. They should think over that policy as i was all alone so there is never be any chances to get it over SGD 20... Shall come again sure next time come to Singapore... :

Go to Kailash Parbat for an authentic indian street food experience in a restaurant setup. Chaats and paani puris are really nice. But my favourite remains the chole bhatura and gulab jamun. A must try for each visit.Dinner for 2 costs about 30sgd++ Service is prompt. I was impressed that the manager cleaned the table when he noticed his cleaning staff were quite busy. Food was served within 5-10 minutes.The ambience is average. Though yhe interiors are done nicely, it doesn't g8ve a traditional Indian feel. Also, I personally found it a but noisy (enough to drown the background instrumentals that I like so much).Overall, a place for authentic indian street food with good service. But pricey and mildly noisy

Try the chats! It's the best u will get in singapore. Also the dinner items are delicious! A bit pricy when compared to other nearby hotels. Try the lassi as well. 2-3 plates of chat n lassi itself can cost u around 30-40 sgd!!! Good to go occasionally!!
4
We picked up Papri chats as a takeaway and four plates set us back about 33 Sin Dollars. The portions were very generous and the taste delicious.The restaurant itself is quite large
5
Excellent India Like food. Great Bhaturas and excellent Chats. Compared to India its costly but its worth the cost getting great food in Singapore
4
It is best authentic north Indian restaurant in Singapore. Some dishes are taste even better than available in India. Many varieties such as chat platter, Kulfi falooda, Live counter are great. Rates on higher side but its not india its singapore.

We visited the restaurant over the weekend when its highly chaotic and crowded in Little India area of Singapore. The atmosphere wasn't different inside. It was well crowded and we had to wait a good 10 mins to be seated. Never mind. We got well seated and staff was friendly too. Well, not attentive enough as compared to what you would expect at a fine dining restaurant. Any ways, as we made ourselves comfortable with few sips of water, we saw the ambiance was nice but hardly noticeable in the crowd. We ordered a few snacks, followed by the main course. I must mention, its a pure vegetarian restaurant, so if you fancy Indian non-veg selection, its not for you. Talking of the food, the snacks and fast food selection is nice and would remind you of food street in India, if you have been there and tried that. As of main course, its a total disappointment and doesn't satisfy any parameter of a good fine meal. Service was below average, may be because they weren't well equipped to handle crowd. So, if you are going down to this place, my recommendation would be to try street food option on menu, like Chole Bature and Chaat. If you are out to enjoy a lavish meal, you can safely avoid it

Kailash Parvat is a home kitchen away from home for all those Indian travellers who can adjust anything but cannot compromise on food.The best place to dine in 3 times a day to have a tastier experience.The whole staff ambience and food qualtiy is excellent.The taste is much much better than many restaurants in even India.I dont think one should try different places if staying long Infact u must repeatedly have all ur food requirement from here only leaving your fooding tension on Kailash Parvat

Kailash Parbat is highly overrated for the service, ambiance and most importantly the food it serves.Located in the heart of Little India with a finely lit up ambiance, it is sure to grab attention of on-goers (both Indian and others). It did grab our attention too for the first time I went there with my friends.Upon entering the noisy food-court like environment was a sure turn-off. I pulled my iphone to check on the decibel levels in the restaurant and no wonder it wasn’t me but it was really noisy (110 db). But looking at the number of people, it did give a sense of confidence about the place and I decided to not judge the place simply by its ambiance or comfort to my eyes/ears. We walked towards our table for 4 and we were seated in what looked like a place for not more than 2 adults. Maybe 4 kids weighing 30 kg each is what they made the table for. We successfully pushed ourselves in through the cramped up table and ordered our food. So far I was still giving the place, a second and now a third chance, banking highly on the food they will serve. After all, restaurants are meant to serve food. Other things are add-ons.After a not-so-long wait, our orders were on our table: few starters of Paneer (cottage cheese), Pani-puri, few drinks (around SG $5 for a lime juice!!). The first few bites of food added to the severe wounds of ambiance, seating and service. There is no way there will ever be another chance if the restaurant fails at its food.Pani-poori was broken and it did not hold the masala/paanis (syrups). Other chats either were tasteless or excessively spicy. Paneer was half cooked and hastily massaged with a layer of masala/garnishing. There was nothing to complain about the roti (bread), but that’s no rocket science for any restaurant. The core strength of this place as claimed is their Chat (snacks) , which was nowhere close to being even half good as what we get at any Indian restaurant.To my surprise every time I went there with an open mind to accept the place and see if anything has changed, I returned with disappointment. I made around 4 visits and now I am writing this review.The final blow was the bill which looked like injustice to what we just experienced. Overpriced!In summary: The place is a lit up version of a food court experience with food half as good as what you get in food courts, as noisy as it is in food courts and you pay three to four times of what you will otherwise spend. Food quality depicts the haste of serving you and pushing you out of the restaurant to get the next in line seated.Maybe a few non-indians may even get close to liking this place. I wont blame them, its just Indian food for them and nothing to compare against.My verdict – avoid ! Save your ears, eyes, tongue and hey, your wallet too

Awesome food - was homesick on my singapore trip with respect to Indian food. Kailash Parbat tickled my taste buds like never before. The chats reminded us of the Kailash Parbat we visit back home in Colaba, Mumbai. The glitch was that it was understaffed, hence servicr was a tad slow - the chef had to bring out the dishes on a few occasions. Management needs to work on the same

Not worth it.....food is not that great....if you ask for alterations (like leass spices and all) they will never follow it!Home delivery time is 1.5 hrs and food never reaches before 2 hrs.Once i even received my entire order with out salt n that too after waiting for 2 hrs.Bikanerwala does much better job.Papri and rice flakes which they use in their chats are alwys soggy and not crispy.Boondi raita is a mix of very less curd and lots of red chilli.Masala lassi is again filled with red chilli only.Staff is most of the time too hay wired to be organised and attend to guests properly that can be beacuse vegetarian people dont have much options.Definitely not recommended if you have time and patience to wait and look around for another decent place

After coming back from India recently my taste buds were tickling for some good indian chatpatta food ... Looking at the lay out of the restaurant and what I heard about the restaurant in radio advertising ( Of course they are paid) ... I thought this is the place best suited to give me the same experience what I had in Delhi few days back however to my surprise the food is not at all good ... Not fresh... Oily ... Forget about the taste. Even the tea took almost 15 mins to come and was clearly not fresh as I could see the clotted layer on top, when I asked to the person serving the tea..... Is this Fresh ? His reply was yes the tea is fresh however it's just served late!!!!! The Ambiance is nice however to get repeat customers ambiance ONLY will not help. For the time being I am not returning back to this place hope they make some changes.Thanks

I went to Kailash Parbat for lunch during my visit to Singapore. I ordered a 'Thali'. First the waiter said Thali is only upto 3.00 PM, I reminded him that time is 2.50 PM. He agreed to provide me with Thali.Food quality was average, very oily and spicy. Lassi was very sweet. Customers have no choice of getting plain or salty Lassi. I was provided heavily buttered roti. I was told that's how bread is served in Thali.I think its best avoidable if you do not like oily and heavy indian food

We have a wonderful time in dining at Kailash parbat Singapore. Its very close to the shopping malls. Also the food there is very Authentic with North Indian / Chinese dishes. We were really happy with the service we got and the food quality..
4
Good veg food , good ambience. Price ok. Suitable for family with kids.
DO NOT EXPECT QUALITY SERVICE........its just ok.
4
Saw "Chats"in the caption and visited this place to give a try. Ordered Samosa chat and was very good. Even Sandwich here are worth a try. Dont miss this place if you like chats :)
4
The name being a popular eatery in Mumbai attracted me to this restaurant. Food was good, reasonably priced. But no great variety. Value for money indeed.
4
If you are looking for good vegetarian food in singapore, this is the place. It will cost you around 20-25 SGD for two people.

Apart from South Indian breakfast restaurants, most Indian eateries in Little India replicate authentic Indian cuisine. Kailash Parbat, serves snacks from a particular region in India. Their branches in Mumbai are very popular and this branch has mostly maintained the standards. You have to know what to order. Skip the Pani Puri and the Pao Bhaji, the Ragda Pattice, the Chole and the chats are great. They have two outlets now, one opposite Mustafa. The staff are friendly and helpful
4
If you want to savour typical North Indian street and junk food favourites - this is the place to go.The selection of "Chaats" is very good and the 'Methi Chola - Bhatura' was amazing.Go with a good appetite though - you will feel so full afterwards that you will want someone to drag you home!.I had a small issue with the mango lassi which was sour due to the yogurt sitting out for too long. It was replaced immediately with another glass which also was sour. The friendly staff offered to compensate me with complimentory dessert which I declined as I was already bursting at the seams!.Good fun sunday brunch hangout

Since we are pure vegetarians and we like to have Indian food where ever we go, when we came to know about this restaurant we decided to go there.Its situated in little India. It was late when we reached. We were dead hungry and there was waiting list for more then 30 mins. It was irritating but no option. We knew Kailash parbat as its present in Mumbai at many locations and its quite good. At last when we got the seats and we ordered, thankfully order was delivered quite quickly.The food was delicious and exactly like we have in India.Everything ordered was delicious. Cost was little more but still it was worth every penny.Strongly recommended for vegetarians and also people who love Indian vegetarian spicy food

We had our 6 out of 9 meals at Kailash Parbat, Syed Alwi Road, Singapore. Beautiful restaurant in terms of food and menu. Menu is the same as in India and the food served is equally well made and tasty.Portions are good enough to serve 2 people and given the Singapore trend, it does the fit the average bill.Must visit hotel for all Jain & Vegetarian food lovers. Should mention about the staff at Kailash Parbat, Syed Alwi Road location - very nice and helpful staff. Ever ready to help, suggest and give their best.Keep up the good work and all the best KP !!

Hi called Kailash parbat today (26 dec 2012, 15:48) and was checking about the buffet arrangement. First of all the staff not respond and said check the website for any details. When i asked i had a bad experience last time but i hope this was just accidental so want to order again, the staff rudely ANSWER , THEN PLS DONT COME. Same happend in August when i thorw a party at KP and it was full of mismanagement. Foods was not served and most of the time many dishes not available and i was busy to greet my friends. I thought it was just bcoz of 1 staff member but now i KNOW whole KP staff is rude and no customer respect. FOOD IS LIKE NOT WORTHY AS THE PRICE ON TOP OF IT THE TERRIBLE STAFF

We visit this restaurant regularly & this is one of the best North Indian Pure Vegetarian Restaurant in Singapore. Also, serving food without onion & garlic. Quality of food is very good & it is very tasty! ;)
4
nice memories of indian street food, which you try to avoid when in India due to the risk of upset tummy, but here you could indulge to your hearts content, quite pricey though, and taste not as 100% authentic as when in India
4
Was there for lunch the food was very authentic and there was absolutely no compromise on the flavors.
Nice joint if you cant stay without Indian Food
3
Kailash parbat being an Indian chain is popular for its Chaats. Our first visit to KP (last year) made sure we are a regular visitor to this place but after that all visits have been highly disappointing.
5
I have visited the location on Syed Alwi road twice and thoroughly enjoyed the experience both times. The food is excellent, the prices are reasonable, the decor is pleasant and the service is pretty good (in a country notorious for horrible service). Neither my husband nor I are vegetarian, but the food is so delicious we didn't miss the meat. If you've never tried Indian vegetarian food (I'm new to it myself), I recommend the Papdi Chaat, Pani Puri, Tandoori Tokri, Khyberi kadai paneer, Lasoni dal tadka, Tarkari mandi

I was very excited to try this famous Indian chaat chain here in Singapore. The dahi puri was great, the chole samosa was not good. We ordered a few more dishes, they were not memorable. Overall, about 6 chaats, only one was outstanding. Very disappointing from my high expectations. The decor is great, very modern and clean. Nice dishes and good service. We won't go back, we will try some cheaper chaat places
3
Their street Chaat items on their menu are elaborate, but expensive for $ 12 which is the price for a snack only...The main course is just average. Had taken my parents when they came but it do not think we would ever go back there as the food is very very average and prices overrated considering Singapore's wide choice of indian restaurants with very good food and prices.We personally would never go there given a choice
2
This is pathetic restuarent and these guys are looting people in name of thier restaurent decoration. Only thier plate, table cloth and restaurent jhoomar(lighting) will attract you here.The quantity of serving plate food is too low and i feel the food was reheated food.I order bhel poori and i feel this was they pout maggi sous on it. No standard, not proper table service (very less staff in ratio, all serving staff passing ball to next if you ask something).IF YOU TRUST ME NEVER GO TO KAILASH PARBAT IF YOU ARE GOING TO EAT TASTY AND REASONABLE RATE FOOD.I appriecite "Kahansama" who is just in front of this reastaurent for great taste and resonable rate
3
A place which deserves a miss. Just because the food is nicely decorated on your plate for you, don't make the taste nice or expensive. These guys here are literally slaughtering their customers in Singapore dollars and having the last laugh at their customers. Every Singapore dollar is now 45 rupees and to be paying s$30 for 2 plates of pain puri and a glass of lime drink equates to 1350 Indian rupees. So keep laughing guys! It's matter of time before we laugh at you
4
One of the better restaurants in Singapore serving variety of Indian Fast Food options (Chaat). From Delhi to Mumbai to Gujarat to Sindh...you have it all. And you will be surprised by the authentic flavours and taste. However, stick to safe options like Golgappe, Aloo tikki etc. New exotic options like (Masala Chhole Bhatura) could disappoint you.Range of sweets and beverages is also satisfying.Only downside is price...but should be okay for your desi craving.Note: They also have outlets in Mumbai & Hyderabad. Hyderabad (Inorbit Mall) was too disappointing...to say the least
