Enjoyed the wolf burger. Ordered medium well and it came just right. Fries can be a bit more crisper. Friendly staff. Will try the butter milk chicken next time.

Had the mighty alpha and it was amazing. Double patty, double cheese, double the goodness! üëçüèª you should also add an egg and bacon to satiate your tastebuds fully üôÇ

They have both indoor and outdoor seating to suit your taste. Good selection of beer to go with your burger and various types of fries too.

Small place for nice burger. Quiet on a Saturday afternoon.
Tried both the wolf burger (add on egg and bacon), and the shrooms mushroom burger. Both beef patty were moist and delicious.

Extremely disappointed with all the food there given the high ratings. Definitely overrated. We ordered truffles & kimchi cheese fries. The fries were not crispy at all & so hard. I ordered the wolf burger well done without onions, but the meat was still red & there were onions. For the drinks, we ordered milkshakes - chocolate malt & horlicks. Extremely sweet & the millshakes were way too thick that we couldnt even get anything up the straw.Will not be returning, unless its a free mea

Came across this burger place by chance in Changi City point. Most thrilled to find out that they can customise their burger to a low carb option. I ordered the Alpha Burger ($14.90) which comes with 2 beef patties cooked to your preferred doneness. I ordered mine medium and low carb, meaning they put my double patties in a salad bowl. Upgraded to a set for an additional $9 for a craft beer and fries. The combo was oh so satisfying and guilt free (well, I refrained from finishing the fries, which was pretty yummy too). I wolfed down my burger salad before realising I forgot to take a picture, haha. Now I know why they are called Wolf Burgers! Pretty good value overall. The staff were helpful and friendly, and I definitely see another visit in the near horizon

crazy good deal of 4 burgers, fries of your choice and sodas for 40 bucks!! came to this place after a long flight from Manchester with my family and we would like to give proper credit to the staff as my children were up to a lot of mischief and they accommodated them nicely. burgers were fantastic, and fries were crisp. strongly rate this place
