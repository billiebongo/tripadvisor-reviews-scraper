We wanted somewhere quiet and different for a dinner and this was not a bad discovery. Food was served fast, not sure if it's because only 2 tables were occupied on Monday evening when we arrived. Overall, good value and nice experience.

We occasionally go to Buttercake and enjoy the food, it's good quality at a very reasonable price. Some of the crockery choices are a little bizarre but thats not too off putting to be honest. We are looking forward to the relaunch next week

$59.90 set meal for 2 was a steal. Starter, mains, dessert, fancy fizzy drink. Presentation was great and taste did not disappoint.
For a small outfit, the variety on its a la carte menu was impressive.

Try their chocolate pudding... Simply delish! Firm on the outside and yet filled with moist warm chocolate oozing out from within.
You will be blown away by the impact.
The iced tea is also nice to do with!

We’ve been planning to visit this place since it appeared to the facebook’s timeline. And since its friday (not to mention its 13th!) we paved our way to end the week’s chaos by treating ourselves with foods. And ohhh dear, it doesn’t disappoint! Allow me to give my appreciation through stars:-Ambiance - spell COZY! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Food - soooo DELICIOUS! Not to mention, served on the dot! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ We had spicy ocean salad, new zealand mussels, wild truffle mushroom soup, king salmon capella, char grilled beef tenderloin, carbonara and we topped it with the nicest desserts of malteser 1936 and chocolate lava cake! Price - with the taste of the food, the price is just nice. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Service - at the time of our visit they were 90% full. And the staff who attended to us is way too nice to attend to each every request we had. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Will we ever come and visit again??? —YES

We ordered 4 main courses of spaghetti and truffle fries n fried chicken wings for appetizer. Waiting time for food was unusually longer than expected given that there are only a few tables for this small restaurant. But it was full house and it might be that all the tables started to order the food at the same time for dinner. The serving of spaghetti was huge and ladies couldn't finished them. However the taste for spaghetti was just so so with nothing fantastic about it. I would say the disappointment for that was balanced out by their desserts. We had paddle pop cake n ice cream together with chocolate lava cake and chocolate pudding cake with ice cream. All 3 of them were delicious and worth the visit there. We wanted to order coffee but was told that their coffee machine was down and would only be able to serve is normal coffee with milk. They were complimentary in the end I believe because of the fried chicken wings. We found the taste a little bit funny and we feed back to the waitress. We did tell her that it may be the seasoning and the taste which we are not used to and that there may be no problem at all. She took back to kitchen and came back with another chicken wing saying that the chef has checked and found nothing wrong. Well at least my 3 years old daughter liked it.There were short on waiting staff n kitchen staff during our visit. Couldn't provide us with a dessert spoon for ice cream but after asking again and a while later they provided us with newly washed spoons. None the less their customer service was great. Food was ok but desserts were nice. Place and atmosphere is also cosy.

Had lunch there with my mother, the food was excellent, and the place had a lovely vintage garden cafe atmosphere. The lunch sets on weekdays are $15+, quite affordable and very much worth the price. The Chef's Teriyaki Chicken is deliciously tender, and subtly savory with a hint of paprika, unlike the overly sweet or insipid versions commonly found. The vegetable croquettes were perfectly done, crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. The wild mushroom soup was rich and fragrant, but the accompanying salad was average, though with a nice sesame dressing. The best part of the meal for me was the dessert of the day - Earl Gray and Fig ice cream which I suspect they make themselves. The fragrance of the Earl Gray complemented the sweetness and crunch of the figs sublimely. I look forward to trying the cakes that they're known for in the future.The only downside is that the waitstaff did seem slightly overwhelmed by the lunch crowd

After being closed for a few months we were pleased to visit the new place after the relaunch. The only problem nothing had changed....menu was the same apart from portions getting smaller and the coffee machine that had been broken for months which had been repaired was now broken again. They said the coffee machine was a glitch but after returning for a second visit we were told that it was broken again. For desert some of us like coffee and some like cake, the outcome was that we left and had desert somewhere else that could provide both

If you are in the west, do check out this cafe at Sunset way. Highly recommended for dinner as the ambiance is really romantic.I have been visiting the cafe for numerous times & the quality of the food stays consistent. Go for the ribeye steak if you love beef. Otherwise, my personal favorite is the chicken leg. As for dessert, highly recommended the rainbow paddle pod cake, and the chocolate lava cake. Beautiful presentation that you will hesitate to start. If you need any customized cake, check out with their chef.And if you are looking for a place to hold a private cosy event, definitely a place to consider. The cafe can hold up to 48 pax on non-rainy days. Look for Lai. She's a wonderful lady who is understanding & helpful
