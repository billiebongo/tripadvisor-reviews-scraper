Food was decent. Halal food was offered. However the tom yam does not taste like tom yam soup. The rest of the dishes are fine.

We were told of this place from our hotel staff -for good NONYA food and it did not disappoint. We chose a Mango Salad with 'soft shell' crab. They were the best soft shell crab I've ever had. Also a beef rendang, so tender.

We had thai food set menu
Overall not that great for authentic thai food.....Tom yam was not spicy enough
We went there as our Singaporean friends hosted us.
If you are a tourist...don't bother to go....it's quite out of the normal tourist track

Every visit to Singapore friends like to take me to a restaurant that is building a reputation. Bumbu in the Arab section was today's selection. We ordered a lot of different dishes. ALL were excellent. I cannot tell you if the bill was expensive as I never saw it but recalling menu prices, I would say the dishes were reasonable. The one complaint I have is that a rice dish and a drink we ordered never came. Near the end of the meal we reminded them that those two things were never served. We were asked if we still wanted them. We said yes to the drink but no to the pineapple rice dish

Dinner arrange with my Muslim friend. Found this restaurant through Trip advisor and decide to give it a try.Had Pomelo salad, Tahu telor, Sambal brinjal, Olive fried rice, fried mee sua, ngoh hiang, tofu meatball soup and beef rendang.Pomelo salad, Tahu telor, Sambal brinjal, Olive fried rice, fried mee sua, ngoh hiang as per recommended after reading some review and other friend recommendation via chat group is good. Not too oily and not too sweet. Except the beef rendang is dry and tough. Planning for next family dinner here

We got a much-needed late morning start, then headed down to the Kampong Glam, the Malay and Arab neighborhood to have lunch with our friends again. We had delicious Thai-Indonesian food at Bumbu, in the heart of the action. If you go try the Tahu Telor and the Olive Oil Rice, both delish

Not to be mistaken with other bumbu restaurants, this one serves a mix of Indonesian, and Thai dishes.It is along a row of 2 storey shop houses on Kandahar street.We 5 partners gathered there for dinner one night ( all carrying empty stomachs to ensure that we could and would indulge to it's full contentment ).I was the only one amongst this group of new business partners who had been here a number of times before ; mostly with family members and extended family members to celebrate some occasion or other. Normally we would be between 5 - 12 people so I knew and had tasted most of the restaurant's dishes, and desserts.This time around I ordered as the main dish what I would call their specialty which is olive rice. Each of us then placed one dish each to be shared between us.- deep fried Crispy garoupa garnished with 3 types of sauces - all in agreement that the fish was fresh and the 3 rasa ( 3 tastes) sauce complimented the fish really well.- beef slices in green chilli curry ; went very nicely with the olive rice.- baked chicken wrapped in coconut leaf ; which is a standard Thai side dish. Nothing extraordinary but easy on the palate.- the all time favorite : Indonesian rendang.Theirs was done almost to perfection meaning the beef chunks were soft and the rendang was thick and spicy without being too oily.- sambal kangkong ; not too spicy nor too oily not like what you would get at most places.For dessert we managed to find space for a bowl each of their Chendol - and the Gula Melaka was special.Diners would be quite happy with the bill as well as it only came up to slightly more than S$100.Until I told them, none of my partners realised that we had dinner across the late sultans' bendahari's ( minister) house ; the one painted yellow. And that further down at no.26 was where my late maternal grandfather stayed; where my late mother grew up.Good food, and a wee bit of history - what more can one ask for

This was a spur of the moment decision to have dinner at Bumbu. We wanted something local and spicy and just happened to be driving past Farrer Court. Best decision we made this week as we were very pleasantly surprised by the dishes we ordered. The tahu telor was almost meaty in texture, with a great sauce. The pomelo salad was perfectly sweet salty and sour, and the beef rendang was Lemak yummy. Try the chendol it's worth the calories!!
