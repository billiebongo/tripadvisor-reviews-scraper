We had dinner here during weekday and have to wait for about 5-10 mins for a table. The prices are very affordable here with main costing $10-15. We like their spaghetti. Ribeye steak was also not bad. However, the soup a bit lukewarm.

We had dinner twice in hot tomato the past month and we give it full marks. The staff are great, ambience is good, food tastes excellent. The price is surprisingly cheaper than a lot of other restaurants that serve similar food. Great value for money. Servings are big, so am sure one will be happy after just looking at the food. Presented well and the taste meets the mark.We ordered mashed potatoes for our one year old daughter and she enjoyed it. The mushroom soup was good, I had the seafood platter, with salmon,dory and prawns. It was tasty. My Wife had steak and she loved it too. Ice lemon tea was sub standard so I don't recommend it here. First time it was me,my Wife and our daughter and the bill was just $50+, the second time we were 5 and the baby, the bill was 105$ all in. Overall a great place to have a great tasty meal without having a bill shock.

One good quality of this restaurant is that they keep their food quality consistent. I have been here more than 10 times but the food never disappointed me. Although I wouldn't trust an average priced restaurant to produce a decent steak, they surprised me. Value for money. Clean tables. They could certainly improve service quality. Staff is fairly young, and they give away the feeling that they are not really enjoying the job- not sure why. I will be going there again, and hope to see they improve with time.
