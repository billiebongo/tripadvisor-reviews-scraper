Old school coffee shop. Slightly bitter coffee, fragrant aroma.The thinly crusted toast is coated with delicious kaya (coconut jam).Order the set (with kopi and half-boil egg). We will scoop the bread over the egg, indulgence.In my opinion, Keng Wah Sung (琼华昌) serves the best traditional coffee (kopi) in Singapore. Try the Nasi Lemak too
