Had dinner here, fast service and great food! Had Xiao Long Bao which is pretty good with good amount of soup, crispy noodle with beef very well done, would be back just for the shanghai Nian Gao !!

food here is decent, and service pretty average, nothing spectacular. food prices are standard CBD prices, pretty pricey considering the portions.
2
The waitress here was very snappy, bordering on rude. The Portuguese tarts were at best, ok. I would avoid this place as itâ€™s not worth the money.
3
Place is clean easily accessible. Order our meal via menu. Came in 7 mins. It's fast and efficient. Fair price too. Food taste good. Will be back again

Dining alone, ordered 3 dishes.
Roast pork & Kampang chicken taste good.
Fried Beehunn with duck slice with nice sauce but with over-burnt smellðŸ˜›

can't really go wrong with dim sum at crystal jade. it's comfort food. the service and the quality of the food are good. the consistency of the porridge is very good. the egg tarts are small but delicious. the other items are above par compared to other outlets. we like the pu er tea which the wait staff refilled constantly. most of items come in 3 pieces per plate
4
We ate lunch on our way to attend our convention and we stopped here. The food is very good from the salted egg prawn hokkien fried race to the xiao long bao. I think it's a must try when you also visit the fountain of wealt

I visited the branch in Victoria StreetBugis Junction Singapore Very well runThe spicy chicken was excellent but I found the BBQ Pork to be less so in the taste department Service here was very goodI would return The entire meal came to under $3

The Suntec city outlet had a great ambience by the waterfall. Food was great and service was attentive. We ordered the Beijing duck, seafood claypot, broccoli with garlic, stirfry beef. All dishes were delicious, especially the Beijing duck.The first course served was the crispy skin.... delicious. We made the mistake of ordering the second course of the duck to be served with noodles. There was hardly any duck in the noodle dish. We pointed out to the waiter that we only had the skin of the duck and where was there rest of the duck meat. They insisted that it was in the noodle dish ....there were only tiny spartan pieces of neat in there. We pointed out to the next table, who had a whole big plate of chopped up duck, and told them there was no way all that duck was in the noodle dish. The waitresses pretended that they did not understand our issue. Finally the supervisor arrived and immediately proceeded to re-order the chopped up duck for us. Tip: if you order the Beijing duck, make sure that they serve you the chopped up duck (which contains most of the meat) separately as the second course. Do not ask for It to be in the noodle

While visiting Singapore, a friend picked me up and wanted to take me for an authentic Chinese meal. I thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. We ordered way too much food because I wanted to try many things. Everything I tasted was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant

This is one of the favorite restaurants my husband and I went to almost every other weekend while we were living in Singapore. I simply loved their steam poke bun and conge.
It's a good dining option for couples, family & friends.

This place does not need any introduction in Singapore. Everybody knows and loves it. Nothing I can say which everybody already knows. Just want to share that I love the xiao long bao, la mian and roast duck here.
5
People say this is best Xiao Long Bao outside China. I've tried theirs in three countries and they have never disappointed. The rest of the menu is equally satisfying. For me Crystal Jade is a sure shot.

After walking around the Suntech city finally I had to compromise with my wife who is very font of Chinese food , but I have to say that Cristall Jade RESTO has maintained their reputation being the best quality of Chinese food with a great taste and no MSG . We selected fresh spargel with mushroom and japanese shiitake saluted with truffle oil which is a heaven , you can taste the freshness of the asparagus and the mushroom is chewy but excellently cooked , we were very satisfied . The other roasted pork is also a right choice is very tender but the skin is sooo crispy and to my wonder you may separate the fat from the Akim as well as from the meat very easily by means of chop sticks . The taste just heavenly . Then the dumpling is also so fresh and tasty , but inside the big prawns are well cooked , but Not over or under cooked . All in all we spent a valuable S$ 55.- for 2 pax , just other thing not acceptable to us was the Chinese tea ordered Pu Er , but served not Pu Er and in a glass , that was our disappointment but not ruining our joy in tasting the meals

The Crystal Jade in Suntec City is our favorite yum cha restaurant in Singapore. The setting is great - get the right table and you can face the waterfall. The service is second to none - the waitstaff are really on the ball here. The menu is extensive and beer is available. The place is spotlessly clean.We'll be back.Cheers Niels & Mary, Humpty Doo, NT, Australia, Down Unde

As a long time and repeat customer of the Xiao Long Bao La Mian outlet in Ngee Ann city in Takashimaya I have to say that no matter what chinese dim sum or noodle restaurant I visit, I always go back to Crystal Jade!The honestly have the best xiao long bao. Medium thickness of the wrap, juicy sweet and savory filling with a good amount of soup and always perfect. Their pan fried gou tie is always amazing, as well as their raddish pastry and chilli oil wantons! For those who are passing by their outlets around lunchtime after 12, there's a good lunch set of a small individual portion of noodles with one dim sum which is totally worth it. In the last year or two there was a choice of a 'half' portion of la mian noodles for all their noodle dishes but now the menu is back to one size of their regular very large size of noodles where the one portion is enough to share between two people!Their la mian is always cooked just right, chewy and firm. I love their dishes wish chilli oil as they're always fragrant and so tasty. For those who are noodle lover this outlet from them is really the best. In terms of their dim sum and noodles the dishes are very affordable considering its located in Orchard.I will continue to patronize this outlet of crystal jade, as their standard continues to be very high and service to be consistent

On arrival, the place was very busy and bright. After sitting down the easy way in choosing an item was very good. LOOKING AROUND AT OTHER MEALS IT WAS VERY NICE. The food was very hot with a large bowl, I could eat all of it but I took my time having the Dumpling Soup. I saw many people waiting to be seated as at dinner time it can be busy. The drink was ok. The price was good and happy to return later on

Our first restaurant experience in Singapore since we relocated here in early June. We liked the look of the hundreds of choices on the menu and went in for lunch. Party of 6 during the busy lunch hour at Suntec City location and they had a big table in the back ready for us so there was no waiting to be seated. Waitresses were friendly and attentive. Food in our opinion was very good. We ordered a variety of items including fried rice, dim sum, vegetables. Everything ordered was brought out quickly even during a clearly busy time of day. Would visit this restaurant again, as a matter of fact we did

We were here for dinner on a weekend and there was a bit of a crowd. They seated us on a big round table although there's only 4 of us and 2 kids.We ordered the porridge and some dim sum as we were not really hungry. Good but not outstanding is what I can say about the food. But the quality is definitely there. The prices are very competitive. Great value meal
5
I have eaten dim sum all over Asia and this has to be one of the best. Every time I visit Singapore it does not go without a visit to thus restaurant for a dim sum lunch. The quality and variety of the dim sums here are some of the best you will ever have. A definite must.
3
This place is rather popular and while the la mian is pretty tasty, i find some of the other dishes very average. As for xiao long bao, their version is nowhere near as tasty as Din Tai Fung in my humble opinion.
4
Good kailan, xiao long bao, and fried rice. Not totally impressed with 1 piece of pork rib for $8. So so spring roll. I've had better experience before. Not consistent across branches.
5
I like all food hear, Chichan Soup, Dumpling and all Dim Sum
3
The food we had were good, but not really exceptional. If it were just a restaurant ,i would say very good. But since they mentioned of michelin in one of their signage outside, i would think this is THE restaurant, but it must be another crystal jade. We tried some ramen, fried rice, dimsums, and veggies. I have to mention the xiao long pao. Cant help but agree with another reviewer, din tai fung's taste bette

So dinner for Mrs S and I tonight was at Crystal Jade. We both felt in the mood for more dim sum and this looked right up our street. On arrival the staff seemed rather distant and not too friendly. We hadn't understood that we were supposed to write our orders on the menu sheet provided and hand it in to order, which led to us sitting around for a while wondering why no one would come take our order. The place was very quiet so not much atmosphere but we were hungry so we ordered six different dim sum dishes to try between us. We got some good advice from the waitress who suggested two of the dishes we had selected were very similar so we might want to swap one for a dish which she highly recommended to us. We swapped and I'd say we weren't disappointed with the end result. Generally all tasty, although some were very watery (in my greed I managed to burn my mouth!!) but generally tasty, albeit not the best dim sum we'd had. When all was said and done, we walked out stuffed full and our pockets only lighter to the tune of SG$38 (2 cokes accompanied our food), so you can't really complain at that price

Had visited the restaurant on Sunday evening, the restaurant has only 3 or 4 tables filled at 6pm. As we were all very hungry already, we ordered a table full of food. Everything is good, but the guo tie and xiao long bao has the same filling except for the skin, the skin for guo tie ain't that nice though.

My aunt and I had lunch here. While the service is fast, the food is great, I can't help thinking about the atmosphere, it is not so great. The aunties are taking away the used dishes very quickly, it makes me feel I'm in a Kopitiam.

After enjoying our meal here last year, we returned again this trip for some Peking duck. We walked in at 8pm and found the place busy, but with plenty of empty seats. We ordered our drinks and then after a bit of a wait, we signaled to the person who had served our drinks that we would like to order. She in turn had to find someone to take our food order as she only did the drinks.The first thing we ordered was half a Peking duck, only to be told that they had sold out for the night. So then we ordered the roast pork instead, but before the waitress allowed us to order that, she had to check with the kitchen to see if they had any roast pork left. I whispered to my wife that if the answer came back no, we'd pay for the drinks and leave. They did have some, but it mustn't have been much left because when it came to the table, it came in a tiny dish with only 8 pieces of pork. Not really good value for what we paid.The fried rice we ordered was very nice, just as it was last year. We didn't linger after we finished our meal and drink, just settled the bill and regretted coming back because it had now tarnished the experience of our previous visit last year

Went with my family, did not receives a warm welcome from the staff, give me a feeling that it's ok if we do not walk into their restaurant but my brother was really hungry so we decided to go with it. And the restaurant was almost empty, just a few customer. Was not attentive to my kids (age 1 & 3), need to requests for kids' utensils.Food wise consider good and I agree that food was quite fast. Could have given "very good" if their attitude and attentiveness were better

My wife and I decided to have dinner at Crystal Jade during our trip to Singapore. We had not made a booking and the restaurant seemed very busy (being a public holiday), but we were shown to a booth straight away. The wife wasn't too impressed when she realised that there was some food left on the seat from the previous patrons and she had managed to sit on it.The waitress who took our order seemed to be one of the supervisors as she was wearing a different uniform. Sadly she didn't seem too interested, nor happy about being at work that day, she took our order without any emotion or interest. But that didn't stop us from enjoying our meal.We ordered seafood fried rice, scallops, and half a Peking duck, where the skin is served in pastry wraps, and the meat is then served up in a multiple of ways. The food came out quickly once we received our first dish - the fried rice was a little salty, but very tasty. The scallops were very good, steamed with garlic and ginger - there just wasn't enough of them. The Peking duck was delicious, but the prawn crackers which accompanied the dish were very stale. The final dish was the duck meat braised in spring onions and ginger was very good and there wasn't any room for dessert.On settling the bill, I gave our waitress a big smile and thank you and finally managed to get a thank you and a half smile from her. Would we go back there again? Probably, but only because the food is very tasty

Food is quite good, and services are good and quick. While it is not incredible, I'm quite happy with my experience here. Would be happy to come again when/if I'm in Singapore next time, although it's not a must-do thing.
3
Their sets are great value for money, but variety seems to have declined. Still, this is one of our fave places for korean in SG
3
Quick service, tasty food. Would give it another go.

Nice spicy la mien and xiao long pau!
4
Tasty and rich!
4
Good! La Mian is crisp enough, soup is thick. Dumplings are fresh. But it will be a tough fight with Din Tai Feng if the skin of the dumplings could be made thinner.
3
xiao long bao
4
i lurve the la mian by crystal jade. light n tasty broth, freshly made noodles. gives me a warm n fuzzy feeling, haha
3
Have a basket of Xiao Long Bao to go with ur meal. Lotsa dumplings to choose from.
4
The Suan La Mian was very delicious. Though it was a tad on the spicy side since I am not a good spicy eater, there was a perfect balance between the sourness and the spicyness. The Fried Cube Tofu was fried to perfection. It was not too dry, and soft inside. The various pau on offer there were also brilliant, expecially the xiao long bao and cha siew pau. Definitely worth a visit for those who love chinese cuisine
