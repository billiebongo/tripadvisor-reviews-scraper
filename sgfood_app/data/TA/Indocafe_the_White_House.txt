We are a family of 6, first time at this restaurant and we were impressed with the ambient, service and food. I liked their chendol!
4
Extensive selection of nicely made regional favorites, graciously served in generous portions. Reasonable wine list.

Brought my Dad and our visitor from the US on a Friday night and we all had a good time. The peranakan food by Indocafe is different from typical peranakan food (such as their own version of Otah and Kueh Pie Tee), the ambience is very nice and it was a memorably good evening.
2
... but a less than inspiring meal and the pork belly tasted... cheap. The waiter neglected to take our order correctly and I think the overall impression from our team was that the meat was cheap. Presentation was fine and great effort in presentation by the owners. I think a bit more fusion and flavor with better quality base product would be smart.

Authentic Peranakan cuisine that can be found in the colonial black and white bungalow along Scotts Road. We had the signature kueh pie tee, ngoh hiang, otah, hee peow tng (fish maw soup) and curry fish head which were all awesome! Their chendol panna cotta, a spin on traditional chendol was an absolute hit too

This restaurant serves authentic Straits Chinese/Peranakan cuisine. As it was New Year’s Eve, a special buffet menu was served. This came with or without champagne or wine.The buffet was well laid out. The Chicken & Papaya Salad, Pan-roasted Cod Fish Fillet, Mixed Vegetables and Fish Maw Soup were my favourites. The Nonya desserts were also delicious. The service was good. I would also like to commend Eric, the Manager, who was polite, humble and hospitable.For tourists, I would highly recommend this restaurant for its authentic cuisine in a colonial black-and-white bungalow setting. In addition, the building next door houses a retail store that sells beaded items such as bags, purses, spectacle cases, etc.; all in a variety of eye-catching colours

Housed in a colonial black-and-white bungalow, this restaurant serves authentic Straits Chinese/Peranakan cuisine. It was New Year’s Eve and a special buffet menu was served. The price came with or without champagne or wine.The buffet was spread out in different corners of the restaurant. The standouts for me was the Chicken & Papaya Salad, Deep-fried Tofu, Pan-roasted Cod Fish Fillet, Braised Chicken, Mixed Vegetables and the Fish Maw Soup, all very authentic dishes. The Nonya desserts were bite-sized and just as outstanding, especially the Banana Fritters.The service was good, with empty plates cleared promptly and cups of water topped up. Kudos also to Eric, the Manager, who was polite, hospitable and who came to get my partner and I when we mistakenly thought dinner was served in the other building. That evening, a power outage resulting in a blackout was quickly rectified without any inconvenience to the patrons. Well done!

We went for a Sunday pre-Christmas lunch to Indocafe the White House, and the whole experience was tremendously enjoyable for us as well as our guest of honor (birthday treat!). All the Peranakan dishes we tried were of excellent quality, and the service was friendly, fast and very attentive. The Indocafe restaurant is located in a historic, former plantation house - and the colonial atmosphere is very classy and firs well with the beautiful restored traditional Black & White bungalow architecture. The furnishing and decorations are welcoming in a still sophisticated Peranakan style.We enjoyed our lunch very much, and can only recommend to try the Indocafe the White House for excellent local Peranakan fare
5
The food quality is good. Staff is able to explain the finesse of peranakan cooking to the guests. This is useful to diners who are not familiar with peranakan food. Portion is not large and this allows diners to try more dishes. Staff is attentive and ready with a smile
3
I picked the restaurant based on recommendation from my friend. The location is ideal for us as it is near my work place and the exterior looks cozy. We love the restaurant but the beef rendang is rather hard and difficult to chew. We love the kueh pai tie! Hubby had like 3 rounds of it! The laksa is awesome too! Some other dishes can improve more on fragrant
4
Quiet small bungalow along Scotts Road Easily reachable from MRT station and bus
Smal restaurant Bookings needed
Good quality indonesian/peranakan food though not too many selections
Good for small family celebrations though a little pricey
5
Went for their buffet. The food was excellent. Nice peranakan food that makes me feels like I'm actually at a kampung area sitting down having dinner with my precious family. Price is not expensive for the service that are being provided. Wagyu beef rendang, cod fish. High quality food. Portion being served is small, but you can order as many time as you want. Dessert is the best. Not sweet and melt in your mouth. Totally recommend it
4
You don't have to burn a hole in your pocket to have a posh and serene environment. Taste is light and soothing compare to same dishes elsewhere. You won't feel thirsty after clearing their plates
4
Really like the colonial style house ambient and the staffs are friendly & attentive. Food wise the taste is good but feel that for the Penang lunch buffet, there are too many carbs & not much meat option. And something to call out is their handmade purses & bags are gorgeous
5
Usual nice service and excellent food. Like the Kueh Pie Tee which is DIY style. Ala carte buffet was also available for choice
4
Good food in very interesting surroundings. Was surprised to see that there were Peranakan decorated items such as purses for sale too
4
Peranakan restuarants are always the TOP choice when I think about where to bring my overseas guests to . It's an awesome lunching experience for my guests from China as they indulge in a homely setting with attentive waitressing. Definitely worth the bucks for a buffet served to the table directly

This restaurant is in a beautifully preserved black & white bungalow built in the early 19th century. The interior of this restaurant is also tastefully decorated with Peranakan furnitures & ornaments. According to one of my friends the food they serve here is the most original & healthiest compared to others Peranakan restaurants. However we were disappointed with the Petai as they didn't split the beans (usually it is a must to split the beans & remove the "heart" of the bean & also to make sure there isn't any worms burrow in the heart of the beans). Over all we liked the food we had yesterday. The staffs were attentive.

PasemberSweet turnips, beancurd & eggs, served with potato dressingIt was like traditional rojak, topped with non spicy indian rojak sauce.Lok BakDeep-fried beancurd, yam, ngoh hiang & fish cakeServed with sweet sauce and chilli sauce. The five spice roll was meaty and quite flavourful on its own. The yam roll was quite unique, as it was coated with a thin crispy batter, while soft inside.Belachan KayDeep-fried chicken marinated with shrimp pasteIt was actually deep fried chicken wings. The meat was juicy, with hints of the shrimp paste without too salty.Jiu Hu Eng ChyeBlanched cuttlefish with water spinach and shrimp pasteOne like that young water spinach ( also commonly known as kang kong) was used in this dish which made it easy to chew. The cuttlefish was tender and well flavour without overwhelming. The paste coating the cuttle fish was not spicy, which made it easy for the little ones to enjoy this dish too.Tu Boh SuiBlanched baby octopus served with peanut chili dipSimple but addictive dish which we requested for seconds.O'JianOyster omelette with chives & chilliEggy and gooey texture. Would prefer a more crispy edge.RojakFruit rojak with homemade shrimp pasteNon spicy but well flavoured. Could not help wishing for some crispy dough fritters to go with it.Stingray PanggangGrilled stingray marinated with sambalAnother favourite which we requested for seconds. Felt the second one was much better, as one could smell char burnt smell from the first one. The sambal paste was shiok to go with meaty juicy meat.Sotong PanggangGrilled squid marinated with sambalThis was quite addictive with its chewy texture. One wishing for a glass of beer to go with it.Char MoiFried porridge served with prawnsIt was like having teochew style of porridge after given a stir fried.Kueh Pie TeePastry cups with turnips, seafood & chilli dipIt tasted not bad with the delicate made in house cups, although it would be better had the vegetables braised longer.Char Kway TeowRice noodles with prawns, cockles, sausage & eggsNot bad, although I felt it lacking of wok feel.Char Kway KarRice cake with beansprout, pickled radish & eggsIt was the least favourite dish. One felt that it was fried with salt instead of the usual soya sauce, making the dish a tab too salty.Nasi LemakCoconut rice with kapitan chickenOne could smell the rich curry from far. The chicken was tender and flavourful. The rice was light and fluffly, just nice with the curry gravy alone.Penang LaksaSpicy fish broth noodles served with spring rollsIt was served in a tiny traditional rooster bowl. The soup looked light, was quite flavourful.Bubur Cha ChaYam, sweet potato & banana in coconut milkIt was served hot. The soup was rich and creamy. One may felt that it was a tab too sweet.Si Quai TengLongan soup with barley, red beans, jelly & lotus seedOne remarked that there seems to have chopped sea coconut in the dish too. The soup was light without too sweet. Just nice for a cold wet day. Warming to the stomach.Ice Cream BreadLocal ice cream flavour of the day, served with breadThe ice cream was raspberry. It was served with rainbow coloured bread, making it felt very old school.Overall most of the dishes were great. Like that most the dishes were not overwhelming or too spicy, which allowed one to add the spicy chilli paste to one's level

Love every return visit to the White House. This time was with an overseas visiting business associate. The service has always been good. Food is unpretentious or overly fancy. Menu is concise and includes the main peranakan favourites. Flavours are distinctively different so you won't be ordering 2 dishes that end up tasting remotely identical. Belachan chilli is smokingly good. Staff are professional and do not unnecessarily engage in small talk. Tables are spaced well apart so diners can feel free to engage in conversation without the fear of disturbing the group at the next table. Does great justice to the peranakan culture
5
The food, service, and ambiance of this restaurant are excellent. It's small and doesn't seat many people, and reservations are important. We were in typical tourist clothing and noted that we were underdressed for the restaurant.
We highly recommend.

A good restaurant with reasonable prices and excellent atmosohere. I would like to use it again for the dinner with my clients.

Enjoyed tasty peranakan inspired dinner in the ambiance of a colonial style Black and White House decorated with peranakan antiquities. Food was excellent and attentive service. Would certainly recommend the chendol panna cotta if you have room for dessert
5
went there for lunch and they have a new lunch set @ 32++ with a good combination of different choices.Like the place and will come again
5
Ambiance was perfect. Great place to dine with friends. Bento lunch meal was superb, esp the one with wagyu beef brisket. Highly recommended for tourists, like me, who are looking for a place to unwind.

I would have rated dinner at this restaurant very good, if it was not for the ala' carte menu vs. the tasting menu fiasco. i.e. We were a table of 4, and they handed us both menus, saying we could order from either/ or. - After a bit of indecision, two of us opted for ala' carte while the other two chose the tasting menu. *(that's small potions of anything in the tasting menu, brought to your table). The waitress took the order quite happily, but within a few minutes, she was back telling us that we must ALL order ala' carte or the tasting menu. The poor girl struggled with english, so I tried to speak mandarin/hokkien/ and malay to her, but to no avail. Finally, I realised what she was trying to say, and when I asked her "WHY"? (regarding menus) .... she replied: "Company policy"! - We were not happy about this, but did not want to cause a fuss, so we all decided on the tasting menu. As the latter costs three times the price an average dish on the ala' carte menu, I cannot help being cynical about it all. I believe that the management must have decided that they would make much more money if we all went for the tasting menu. *(after overhearing the indecision and discussion at our table). Also, the well dressed Singporean staff with good command of english could have come and informed us of the 'confusion'... instead of sending a non-english speaking waitress who got very flustered and apparently could not even speak mandarin/hokkien/ or malay... but could spout "Company policy" most eloquently! Absolutely loved the colonial black & white house and the ambience. But what about the food? ...Well, the beef Rending, chicken Buah Kuluak, and durian ice cream were good, but as for the other dishes....I have tasted better elsewhere in Singapore
4
I stumbled on this restaurant when another Peranakan restaurant I had in mind was not available . And I am glad I discovered Indocafe!Located in a charming bungalow along Scotts Road, the ambience is cosy , elegant yet homely . The la carte buffet is a good deal ie you can eat as much as you like from the Menu . Great for tasting all the dishes . The menu features all the popular Peranakan dishes . They were good too- kueh pie tie, chap Chye , curry . I liked the Penang laksa and all the desserts . I learnt that they offer an afternoon tea set on weekends which features Nonya cakes . I will be back for that .
5
The food is genuine Peranakan and excellent. The service is attentive and the decor beautiful. The "old house" is decorated with Peranakan artifacts. You have 2 possibilities: buffet served at the table or a la carte. I chose the latest and ordered some of the classic dishes: the Wagyu beef cheeks randang is melting in the mouth
4
I had the opportunity to dine here as part of a business meeting. I was quite pleased with the food. A very interesting cuisine that was really impressive. The service was reasonable and the atmosphere was very good. Indeed it is a very spendy place and we had several bottles of wine, though the selection was not really ideal. I would probably eat here again for a special occasion
5
My recent visit to Singapore is the best as we were brought to indulge authentic Malay Cuisine at Indocafe white house. As most of our delegates come from ASEAN countries and also some from various chapter of the world, the best food to indulge definitely be local Malay cuisine. Choices of food on this theme range from chicken rendang, chicken satay, fried water spinach with belacan, mutton curry, spicy fried prawn and many more. As a welcoming treat, we were introduced to a chilled beverage extracted from lemon grass (non-alcohol). If happen to be in Singapore and craving for authentic Malay Cuisine, this is the place you want to visit and don't forget to ask for the lemon grass drink, it's awesome and refreshing
3
Try it once. It is acceptable and the house turned into a restaurant is lovely. The food is not bad either. A little steep in price but acceptable.
4
The place is nice, the food is average and price is a bit on the high side. Most probably I will not visit again.
4
Surprisingly there was no one in the restaurant this Friday afternoon but we did not feel weird as the staff there were really friendly and professional. Just one thing... The keropok is not crispy 😅
5
We are traveling to Singapore and staying in Sheraton Towers next door. The concierge told us there is this fusion place next door, we are a little skeptical especially when different concierge staff tell you the same thing. When we are tight on time to go elsewhere one day, we just pop by next door for our lunch before our next meeting.The six of us went in around 12 noon without reservation and they were not too busy that day. Upon entering, I was impressed with the interior and deco, the kind of style I love. We ordered quite some dishes to share. I do not remember most of the name of the dishes, but I like most of them. Pictures says a thousand words. Some dishes, you do need some white rice to go with it, since it is a tad salty to eat by itself. I in particular like the one in the pastry shell, the black nut chicken (which you need some rice to go with), and the dessert. We are pleasantly surprised of the quality and the service is excellent. We will be back here again for sure and I will definitely come here with my husband when we are in Singapore next. The place can definitely be great for a romantic night out.

Hosted a successful dinner for 12 friends from overseas recently at Indocafe. I am always a big fan of Indocafe for several reasons: 1) Great ambience in a colonial mansion, 2) Good for big groups, 3) Great location in Scotts House, 4) Cosy feel so don't too noise and good for conversations as well. In terms of the food, the standards in general are excellent, particularly their Ngoh Hiang, Kuah Pie Tee, and Otah. Have never had a disappointing experience at Indocafe
5
The one of modern restaurant you could enjoy the Peranakan Cuisine.You could walk from Newton, but better take taxi to go there.There is an exclusive Art Museum by the restaurant.We didn't go inside, so couldn't comment about it.However, the dinner and wine we had was everything tastes excellent even less option.Highly recommend this restaurant if you are seeking for Peranakan Cuisine in Orchard area
5
excellent service and nice dinning hall, nice food very nice, i like so much, the service is very very nice,we was serve by BHAVANI service staff,Her service was excellent and polite,more professionalism and definitely will recommend friends and family to dine there ... keep up the good work
5
- Buffet menu does not sound interesting to us. So we basically went for a la carte option. I especially love the fish head curry and Ayam Bauh Keluak. The waiter kindly explained to me what the black nuts are. - The place was nice.- The service was excellent. Very impressed by the birthday cake prepared for my mother
3
The black and white colonial house is very quaint The interior with its decorative Perankan/ Chinese artefacts and hardwood furniture add to the homely ambience.The range of food items is extensive but sadly the quality is not uniform.The price for the weekend buffet at $33 plus 17per cent taxes is reasonable
4
Its located off the Orchard rd belt (closer to Newton). The food is great (beef rending, chicken curry and ngo hiang) and the service is attentive and friendly. Portions are on the smaller side and the pricing is on the higher end. One to go for special occasions and Peranakan food
4
This lovely restaurant is in a black and white colonial house just off the busy Orchard Road. A fairly good selection of Peranakan offerings. Price wise is slightly high for the portion served but then you can order more dishes to sample. We particularly like the kueh Putee,babi penteng and chicken buak keluak. The wagyu rendeng other hand is too "fat" in texture for a rendang dish. Service is prompt and friendly
4
Quaint setting in a traditional black and White House from the colonial period. The staff was super nice and extremely helpful, in spite of the fact that the vegetarian options were limited. - Their signature starters were ok-ish, but their main fares were much more nuanced and surprising (in a good way) in their flavors. - there were a log of tastes which at times might have confused a bit, but this was probably more due to the ordering. Not extraordinary, but well worth a visit,- with great service as the cherry on top.
3
So this place is in one of the old colonial white houses along Scotts Road which would make it a very nice and suitable place for tourists to come to. The menu was wonderful with all the great favourites. Food was a mix. Buah keluar chicken was good and they even give really good utensils to dig out the fruit. Sayur Lodeh was spicy. The beef rending was a real miss though. Dessert was okay
5
A good place to be if you are looking for a new dining experience in Singapore. A glance of the "white house" already suggest history and culture. Inside, the restaurant is quiet and cozy. it offers some unique Peranakan or Nonya cuisine, resulting from a blend of chinese ingredients and spices from Malay and Indonesian communities. Food is good, aromatic and excellently presented. Service is good and efficient
4
Except our host over ordered and we ended up taking a doggy bag of fish curry, fried rice and beans. The wagyu beef cheeks and chicken with betel nuts we managed to finish.The setting is perfect and it was not busy at lunch. We got all the attention of the staff
4
During a recent business trip I wanted to try some different tastes and having eaten lots of Chinese, Indian and western food I felt I should try Malay. I asked a locally based colleague to recommend somewhere and they booked a table here. Whilst not purely Malaysian food it was still very different to the other dishes I'd tried that week. We tried a selection of different dishes. Some were very tasty others were less so, but more due to my taste than the quality of the food which seems to be of very good quality. Nice surrounding too even if a little quiet. I think I came here some years ago but barely recognised it as previously there was a big queue at the door rather than lots of empty tables. A reflection of Singapore economy, or a popularity crisis? Not sure but either way the food is interesting and it's still worth a visit.
4
lovely setting in a colonial house. always wanted to try but thought that it would very expensive. however it was not. can't put a price to the lovely ambience, yummy food and the excellent service by the indian lady who waited on us. she knows her menu well, was very polite, made some good recommendations, was attentive and overall impressed us. food wise, the presentations and portions were just right. love the decorations in the restaurant - modern, yet retaining the character. the menu has a good mix of dishes, seafood, meats, vegetables and even some nostalgic dishes. while I found some of the dishes not as spicy as found in other restaurants, i think the mix was just right. Definitely worth another visit. it's easily accessible by taxi, mrt (newton) and car (parking on the grounds)
4
The bill was SGD 390 for 3 person with 2 bottles of house white wine. Overall a decent experience. I do find the prices on the high side, for peranakan food. There are better alternatives in Singapore. However it is a good experience if budget is not much of a concern
3
We loved the colonial bungalow(s) that the restaurant is situated in, with the pots of orchids and other flora dotted around. Inside, there are various pieces of Peranakan artwork, apparel and porcelain displayed on the walls, and tables and seating in nooks and crannies that provide privacy.Service was good yet discreet. Dinner was communal sharing style, where around 8-10 dishes are placed on the table and diners help themselves. There were some very good dishes, such as the kuay pietie, cod fish curry (fantastic) and sambal eggplant. The wagyu beef rendang was soft and rich, but not as flavourful as expected. I liked the babi pontei (braised pork) though my wife felt it was too porky tastewise. The chap chai was nice, but ordinary. We liked the three Malay kueh kueh though one of the multi-layered cakes was too doughy.There is some parking on the grounds, enough for around 5 cars. Overall, it was a good meal admist refined surroundings, with some good dishes

Newton MRT station and a short 5 min walk. We drove there.First time here. CNY reunion dinner with the family. Set menu of SGD288++ for 3 - 4 paxSituated in a renovated "black and white". Quiet and tucked away. Ambience is gorgeous - feels like I've stepped into the dining room of a Peranakan house! Modern interior and feel. As it was CNY, the place was decked out in CNY / red decorations - not overly done, nice and subtle. On the dining table, there was a beautiful, colourful circular pot (I think it's called a "kum cheng") in which they placed some serving sauces. I think the "kum cheng" is a traditional item found in most Peranakan houses - lent a nice touch to the place.Food wise, we chose a set menu with an Abalone Yu Sheng. Other items included a starter (3 small items for each of us! comprising the traditional Kueh Pie Tee, Prawn roll and fried dumpling), broth with generous portions of seafood, a vegetable dish, 5-spice chicken, steamed fish, noodles and dessert. Way too much for us to be honest and we ended up having to pack a few items to go. Taste was simple and not overpowering. While some critics might say there's nothing to rave about the food, I thought the beauty was in the simplicity of the dishes, almost like how mum would prepare it at home - which is what my family and I are fond of.Manager and Service Staff - now this is where I think their forte and true talents shine!! Accommodating, polite, interactive and attentive without being overbearing or "trying too hard". They weren't hovering around but would check in on diners every couple of minutes to make sure you were taken care of - almost like how a host would take care of their guests - sincere and always smiling. Because we chose to omit certain dishes from the menu for health reasons - they were more than willing to do so, even though ours was a set menu (of course, we did tell them in advance). On more than one occasion, they make it a point to tell us that certain ingredients were removed (I have allergies) which I thought was sweet.Overall - I must say I was so surprised at the level of service. Price wise, more than reasonable too - not because the portions were big, or the (fresh) quality of items used but the way they've prepared the dishes made me feel that they took pride in the preparations. I'm sure there are more well-known Peranakan restaurants out there, but they won me over with their sincerity. I'll be back for sure whether with the family or to entertain foreign / local guests alike!Adeline LeeFamily dinner (5 guests)February 201

Hosted here by some very generous local friends. Great location on Scotts Road, service solid, food prompt and absolutely so tasty, catered for the vegetarians, gluten free and carnivores. Not a cheap dining experience but would visit again for the variety. Thanks Vincent!

Nice experience and yummy food.
Went there for lunch and surprised by the high quality of food and services.

Had dinner at this restaurant near the Sheraton Towers.
Food was average and expensive
Service was fine and the restaurant is very nicely decorated
4
I like the ambience of the restaurant, quiet with soft music. Service is excellent though the food is average but the desserts are good.
Perfect for a quiet, peaceful and romantic evening with your loved one.
5
Small but cosy place to host small private event. Staffs are accommodating and friendly. The food is just great! Nice interior!

I can't say that any of the dishes that we ordered left an impression except that they were "ok". We tried the ngoh hiang, the "chawanmushi" otak-otak, beef rendang, prawn assam pedas and the curry kapitan. The four of us felt that the dishes were prepared with the foreign tongue in mind and not with the penchant to produce dishes that was authentically aromatic and spicy - as peranakan dishes should be - with a flavour that would knock your socks off as any reputable restaurant should aspire to. In fact it felt a bit frustrating because all the correct ingredients were used except in a very watered down version. Such a pity!The desserts of pulot hitam and the bubor cha cha were way too sweet - way above any local dessert you will find in another restaurant as these days, dessert cooks usually err on the side of caution when it comes to sugar. The coconut milk topping did not have enough salt so badly needed to have a contrast of flavour. The bubor cha cha had banana in it so it tasted like a cross between pisang pengat and bubor cha cha - neither here not there. Again, just sweet with hardly any pandan flavour. We paid $42 per head for four diners. I couldn't say either way whether it was value for money because the ambience was very pleasant, like dining in a very styled old house (which it was) and the service was impeccable!The ultimate test of a restaurant - Would we go back? Quite unlikely

Hosted a dinner with a family friends from China in a group of 5 adults and 1 child. The location and ambience of Indocafe is great. Located just at Scott Road near the junction of Cairnhill Road and within 5 minutes stroll from Newton MRT station. The dinning area is small and can only seats 6 tables of about 35 to 40 dinners max. Set inside an old bungalow which was built around 1910 makes one feel like going back in time. We order almost 8 dishes for 6 of us and among those worth mentioning is the Assam Udang, Assam Babi and Tampoya Asparagus which is cooked with fermented durian purÃ©e. The others are OK but not special. The 2 dishes that are really below par are Itek Tim and Cattlefish with KangKong. The Itek Tim duck soup with pickled salted vegetable is too salty to be drink as a soup and too strong taste of nutmeg. I will give a thumb down and not recommended unless the cook taste it first. The other dish is Cattlefish KangKong which blended with belachan instead of the usual sweet red sauce like most do. It tasted more like Rojak with a pungent smell of belachan.The Panna Cotta Chendol is a nice dessert to try. A East-West fusion. Pricy for the nice ambience and prepare to pay SGD 50+ per head for Nonya food
4
Had friends come over from Austria, so we decided to book in this place for the 7 of us (and yes, we had young kids with us too). The building is a beautiful colonial bungalow, something you don't get to see all that often in Singapore anymore. The staff were very accommodating when we wanted to order off the menu for the kids and helped us create the perfect set of dishes for us to share. The food was amazing. I would recommend the place as a good night out with just your partner or with a larger gathering of family and friends. Nice work Indocafe
5
Housed in a black & white bungalow from the colonial days, this intimate restaurant serves flavourful Peranakan cuisines with an interesting modern spin. Service is excellent too. Wonderful for family gatherings (their Chinese New Year reunion dinners are creative and generous in portions!) or hosting dinners for visitors from other regions. Reservation is highly recommended
3
We really didn't like the entrees, which were cold but should better have been hot I think. Main courses were decent, but overall too expensive for what you get
5
I went to the Indocafe with a large group of business colleagues. This was the first time experiencing Peranaken food. The food was scrumptious and and service was very good. I will definitely return if I return to Singapore.
4
This is Peranakan (Straights Chinese) cuisine in a fine dining setting. It sounds incongruous but it works. The building is a beautifully restored colonial bungalow (there are a number in this neighbourhood for architecture junkies to enjoy). It's easy to fill up on the appetisers, which actually isn't a bad idea as the mains are relatively small. Particularly recommended are the "do it yourself" Kueh Pai Tee (aka TopHats) and the Ngoh Hiang - 5 spiced meat roll. Among the mains the Beef Rendang is probably the best I have ever had anywhere. The seafood dishes are tasty but not great value for money as portion sizes are small. Perhaps the highlight for me, however, is the Buah Keluak Fried Rice - made with black nut paste. It is probably the most complex flavour combination I've ever had in a rice dish - rich and smoky with lots of umami. Stick to soft drinks unless on an expense account though..
4
I went there on my way back to work as it looked nice.And indeed it is very nice!Colonial style building, nice and discreet service.Traditional food with a modern twist (though sometimes a bit missed). Many spices mastered by the chef, I discovered a very tasty and flavourous Peranakan cuisine.A bit expensive, as located in a business area
2
We had 22 pax come here for Mothers Day High Tea, kind of disappointed coz there were no real peranakan dishes like laksa, kueh pai tee, just special small dishes like fois gras and buah keluak pastries and some nonya kueh that looked like was bought from a canteen. The coffee was their own blend, very light and good for folks who don't drink much coffee, someone said McCafe was better ! The tea was good, but premium tea we had to pay more. The price of $34 *++ was pretty steep for such simple food, guess the lunch at $49++ would have been better? Maybe? But don't think we're gonna come back here in the near future !

This restaurant on Scotts road Singapore is in a bungalow of old colonial style, painted white, and nicely decorated inside. You feel like coming to an exclusive place. Peranakan food is mostly served here. Peranakan or Nonya cuisine combines Chinese, Malay and other influences into a unique blend. Jumbo tiger prawn, Roti babi, and warm chocolate banana are worth trying.Taste is good. Prices are on a bit higher side, which is compensated by good ambiance and quick service
3
This is an excellent place if you want a quiet nostalgic colonial ambience of yesteryear dining in black and white bungalow. However if you are looking for great perakan foods, hopefully the nice place would compensate your disappointment. If you have no clue of peranakan cuisine (Westerners, etc), the foods probably are quite acceptable to you. Our biggest disappointment is that the foods were served cold. The minimum standard at least the foods should be served hot even thought they are cooked in advance as most penarakan foods need to be due to their preparation and cooking time
5
We come to Singapore a lot but this was our first time here. It won't be the last. This is the way to try Peranakan food. The night we were in there was a tasting menu on offer. A great way to sample lots of "small" dishes. I say "small" because that is how they were described. But there was so much we could not eat it all. Really beautiful food. Great surroundings. We were the only non locals that night - has to be a good sign

I've enjoyed many quiet meals at Indocafe over the past couple years since it's across the street from my office. Before I talk about the food, one can't help but think how do these people make money? the restaurant is in a beautifully restored black & white historic home, and traffic is always quite low due to location - so I imagine it's a labor of love or funded by some group, who knows - anyway, that's to our benefit. First, the decor is very traditionally elegant but comfortable. Second, service is just wonderful - full of smiles and attention to detail on explaining the menu and responding to special requests. Oh - the food - wow, delicious. My taste buds are not refined enough to tell you what kind of food it is, other than it's a Southeast Asian blend of everything you could ever want - though the reviews call it Perankan cuisine. My last meal was primarily beef rendan, nicely seasoned and spicey vegetables and a pork dish. what's great about the food is that it's not too heavy, it's seasoned enough to give you a special experience without going over the top. I just love it. I've had many a lunches in this place where we were the only table - so this really is a terrific find. And i imagine a great place for a romantic meal if that's what you're looking for! If you're staying at Sheraton Towers, walk out of the hotel for this terrific experience. Or, if you're headed to Orchard Road, take a nice walk up Scotts Road to this place at 35 Scotts Road. You will absolutely love it

I made a reservation for afternoon tea after reading a review. I drove pass Scotts Road many times and saw the building and always wonder what is in the white buildings.I went there with my wife and 5 year old child. We are the only guest having afternoon tea on a Sunday afternoon. Despite that, the staff is attentive and friendly. Did not look bored at all. The food portion is very small but it is enough for the three of us as we are not big eaters.The food is very well done. The small portions make us appreciate the food even more. The coffee is wonderful. I had 2 refills and would have stayed longer and drank more if my son was not restless and want to leave.Will go back there again for afternoon tea or maybe for a lunch and dinner. This is a good place to go if you want some place quiet.At $34++ per tea set, it is not cheap but I think it is worth it if I think of it as a treat

Food is normal for they price you are paying. However, the restaurant is set in a very nice heritage house and service is excellence

Cute small place "lost" in the Scotts Road. You arrive in a complete other atmosphère. The staff is friendly and helpful. The food is tasty.

We invited our friends from Toronto to try something different. AND it was a superb meal. Lunch time Indocafe is not as busy. Besides our table of four there were another four local guests, who were really enjoying their meal - photographs being taken of the dishes as served.It is recognised for Peranakan cuisine - culinary delights of the Straits. Spiced and herbs that are very delicate, not hot, no burning of mouth, or ears on fire, but truly getting the taste buds to relish every morsel or spoon of curry & soup - their classic dishes that we have tried and enjoyed and new ones - beef rendang, aubergine grilled, cod fish, laksa, prawn with pineapple curry, fried rice with prawns on the side; great pickles to go; and fresh juices - carrot & apple combo my favourite.Our friends were bowled over and as we thought they had also not had food of such fantastic taste in their lives. This was our third visit and we found it to be the best of all.Service - the restaurant manager was himself around to take orders, courteous to the core. The per head with juices and sparkling water was S$50, which for a place with exquisite decor, and 5* service cannot be considered outrageous in the city of Singapore. One should reckon with S$30 a head in the outdoor Newton Food Centre across

This is one of the best places I have been to in Singapore.The prices are European so a bit expensive for Asia but nothing you can't afford. The food is delicious and the staff is great! They are very discrete and yet helpful. The music is quite and in the background so setting a great atmosphere without disturbing. We went on a weekday and it was quite but I am assuming it will be busy on the weekend so better book. The space is excellent as well, very clean

We were here for the Restaurant Week so we had a sampling of their star dishes. We were not too familiar with peranakan food, but we loved the food here. The prices are reasonable, considering the ambiance and the service. We liked the beef cheek rendang and the kurobota pork roast

The Food was pretty authentic . Prices are up there but the portions justify them . We ordered 4 dishes . The roti Babi was tasty but 4 pieces were just enough fir 2 persons. The Babi pongteh was tasty but I missed the unique flavour of the bamboo shoots . The sotong gulai curry was very nice with the flavours of the spices coming through. We particularly enjoyed the ladies fingers with prawns- strong robust flavours. Ask for the sambal belachan - it's exceptional . Forget dessert - the bubor cha cha ( supposed to be their signature dish ) was a disappointment ..... A small bowlWith about 6-8 pieces of yam , sweet potato and banana in coconut milk - $8 !!Service was impeccable and overall a very pleasant dining experience

Great looking heritage building and great service. Decent ambience, but Very average food. We must have tried around 8 dishes, as we were a large group, but not even a single dish suited any of our palette... (And our group consisted of Americans, Philippinos, Indonesians, Singaporeans, Vietnamese and Indians). Also they have a very limited bar menu, serving just a couple of beers, and some wine. Its an expensive place, with not so great after taste

Beautiful exterior in the white house, perfect interior for a business lunch. Unfortunately, service is an issue: we got the clearly ordered appetizers only after asking twice, we didn't get the right main course, either. Staff is friendly, but obviously a bit overstrained, despite the fact that the restaurant was almost empty at lunch on this weekday

IndoCafe oozes a great ambience in a beautifully restored vintage building. The Nonya fare was generally disappointing though the beef rendang was good and the steamed otak tasty in a different way but the menu was over priced. Portions were generous but we could have been better advised before placing orders. Having stated our views, it was kind of the staff to waive the drinks off the bill. Service was flawless. It's a nice place for overseas visitors but not for those who know their Nonya fare

This time we came with our kids. Overall experience was good. Maybe we were overwhelmed by everything our first visit in Sep 2013 that this time the umph was lacking but could have been our imagination.We tried Assam Buah, and Ikan Masak Merah, besides the excellent beef rendang and quite a few dishes of pomfret fish, chicken, aubergine and curries. The servers were well trained in taking orders and also while presenting they took pains to explain and even helped serve. Perfect place to visit for a relaxed lunch. Maybe evenings it is busier
