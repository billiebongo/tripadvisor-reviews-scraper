absolutely beautiful place to look at, offering check in at this location is a very smart option, different from the others

Dispersed food stations sometime with steps.
Cheese and desserts were particularly disappointing.
However, service was excellent.

At S$38+++ the selection was not to my taste. Service was also not very good for a 5 star hotel. I won't recommend the high tea but an afternoon chill out is not too bad.
5
Cannot fault the bar or area providing a high end relaxing area with bar meals and restaurants within hotel.C an get a little chilly with air conditioning though.

Beautiful restaurant. Also connected from inside with Marina Square. All types of cuisine are served.

If you like musoleums, vast marbled tasteless , un welcoming spaces then go here. It's soulless, unwelcoming and clinical . I can't imagine anyone liking this.or not feeling they weren't in a very upmarket bank that had made too much money..this is very bad............

The staff carries this place. Many of the staff have been there for sometime and they work very hard with a smile to serve you. You go back for them and the wonderful setting. Prices are high, but this is to be expected in a five star hotel in singapore. Afternoon tea is nice too, happy hour mo-fri is the best time to go, but be ready that it is often full. Food is very good and a well written menu. Overall a very pleasant plac

I went to the atrium on a Wednesday night with my date for some after-dinner drinks. We were pleasantly surprised to find that the service staff on duty held the reservation for us despite us being slightly late, and we even got the pod seating that we requested. I highly recommend getting the pod seating as it makes for a more private and intimate dining experience.The service team was very professional and attentive, making our stay there thoroughly enjoyable. We had drinks from the coffee menu and ordered some cakes to go with it. It was a very nice experience to dine in the atrium, and we would find a time to visit again

What a great little location to sit and have a quiet drink and good conversation within the Pan Pacific Singapore. The service was an absolute amazing experience, as everybody was so helpful with the so many choices to choose from in the drinks and cocktails range. Friendly staff, smiling all the time, weâ€™re great help, nothing was a problem. Just to sit a talk and relax in a great location after a big day walking around town before dinner was terrific. Thanks.

Was looking for a late lunch and was going to try Ruth Chris at the Marina Manderin but it was closed when I arrived, so I went across the street to the Pan Pacific to have a bite at the Atrium Bar. They say this is the longest Bar in Singapore. The Atrium is quite unique with it's dining pods and water feature. I ordered the Pacific Ceasar, DO NOT ORDER THIS SALAD, From the menu it looked interesting, kale, quinoa, hot spring eggs, romaine, anchovies, heck they are calling it a Ceasar how bad can it be? - Romaine cut way to small was not dried properly so was wet and the dressing was not sticking to it, you were eating small pcs of wet lettuce- Kale, yes there was a bit of kale but it was on top of the Salad and did not having any dressing on it, when one tried to get some dressing on the kale the sharp points of the kale would hook a pce of Anchovy, so you got the crunch of kale with the taste of anchovy. Dressing was too thin, so did not stick to the Kale.- Hot Spring Eggs, not sure what happened to the hot and the s at the end of eggs. One semi soft cold poached egg. Not good and did nothing for the salad- Smoked chicken, yes there was chicken, but it tasted very processed, maybe done in house but probably came out of a tube- Quinoa, there wasn't any that I could find. I ate the Kale, chicken and a few pcs of the Anchovies. The romaine was inedible and the dressing was tasteless. They should be embarrassed to serve this. When I was asked how was it, the bowel was still 3/4 full and I said not very good, the server advised yes "we hear that a lot". Note to management if customers are complaining about a menu item listen and learn. The salad would be perfectly fine if it had a real Caesar dressing, ranch out of a bottle would be better than what they are serving as a Caesar dressing, if the romaine was prepared properly and the eggs were hot as the menu describes them to be. Also wouldn't hurt to add some parmesan to bring it closer to a Caesar Salad. So far worst Salad, of any type, that I have ever been served

Found the whole arrangement to be quite interesting. Good place to have something to eat or drink. We sat here for a nightcap after dinner somewhere else, and had a couple of rounds of drink. Service was very good.
5
Nice bar with a great atmosphere, we drank here every night and it was very relaxed. The bar staff were great and started to remember what we ordered. Great :D
5
During the week this area has plenty of space and the drinks and food are very reasonably priced. I found it more difficult to get a table at the weekends though especially in the evening
5
Good place to unwind after a long day. Tasty drinks with a good atmosphere and great service by Blair and her team
4
The "pods" are interesting and keep the noise down so you can actually hear your conversation. Happy hour prices are pretty decent for Singapore. They did a nice job with the recent renovation.
5
Good atmosphere, good bar with multiple choices of drinks. Special highlight on Ms Blair at the bar: top class service, good intentions and customer oriented! Service high class Benchmark all Singapore bars should try to reach!

Decided to try chilling at the atrium. Went there and was looking for a available seating pod but the bar is fully packed. Asked the staff many times to find a available pod but they are not willing to help but finally managed to find one myself after a customer left.In all, the bar has nice ambience but has limited food on the menu but many drinks option.Be sure to make reservation before to ensure a seating pod and never do walk in.Dr E. Chow

I was there for high tea with a group of friends. The venue was not full house but it took the crew at Atrium a full 5 minutes before the presence of the group of 3 at the entrance was noticed and finally attended to and show to the table. The high tea gathering at the Atrium was not a walk in but via reservations. In terms of service and overall experience, dining at Atrium was a flop. Service to the guests was lacking, and even requesting for service at the Atrium via the intercom at each table was not useful. Often, the service call request was missed and ignored. The only thing that was worth mentioning of the visit at the Atrium was one of the staff Jonathan. Among all the staff, Jonathan was the only one who provided a service with a smile and attended to us efficiently when he is available. Jonathan was knowledgeable in his work,able to provide recommendations, and know the menu of the Atrium well. Without Jonathan, I would say the experience at the Atrium was a failure. The management of the Pan Pacific Hotel would need to ensure that the service staff are attentive to the needs of the guests and the surrounding environment. To made a guest wait at the entrance when it is off peak hours at the hotel, is not acceptable

We stopped in for an early drink on our honeymoon vacation. It was our first stop of the night and the bartender, Blair, gave us an amazing list of places to visit while we had some great cocktails and snack! She was incredible! The cocktails were like nothing I've ever had before.
5
I came at the Pan Pacific hotel several times for business and never missed a stop at the incredibly stylish "Atrium". It's a place you'll sure remember. Its design is unique, with its tables litterally "floating" in what looks like a zen garden and its oversized bar.The place offers a wide choice of cocktails, including some very good specials. It may not be so well advertised, but it deserves a visit. Its quiet environment is great for chilling.During many visits, i got to know the waiting staff which is very well organized. Ms. Blair (who seems to be the maitre de salle) is very competent and friendly.Prices are no higher than the standard in Singapore, which makes the place, in my opinion, really suggested
5
Great atmosphere, attentive staff and good coffee and drinks. A little pricey but so easy to sit, talk and relax with friends.
4
Beautiful seating. Well made cocktails and mock tails. Great service. A bit on the pricy side but you pay for the ambience.
5
The ambience was classy and relaxing. Drinks was nice and we would like to thanks the server, Blair who provide us an infinite and impressive service.
5
I had an afternoon tea here. It was fabulous. The ambience was classy and quiet. Service was great and attentive.
5
Great bar in the lobby of the hotel. So relaxing and have great big booths for privacy. Drinks prices are reasonable

Enter the foyer of the Pan Pacific Singapore and you can't miss The Atrium to your left with the giant "pod" seats and their conical tops. You feel like you are on the movie set of Avatar!Bursting with colour and generally full of suit-types, Atrium has a sophisticated and classy crowd that keeps it ticking over. Prices are dear like most Singapore bars, but that didn't seem to stop the traffic of happy guests. As a guest at the Pan Pacific, I barely noticed the noise and as a single business traveller I was happy to notice that I was not alone. Great place.
5
A comfortable environment for chilling and meeting up with friends. Was seated at the bar and served by Blair. She was friendly, attentive and provided advice on my cocktail order. She made the experience very comfortable and causal. Ordered Miner's Punch cocktail and Gambas Al Ajillo. The Gambas is good for sharing and had tasty and succulent prawns. My friend came later and ordered Monkey 47 and tonic which was excellent too!! Thanks Blair

Enjoyed a couple of drinks and some sliders here during a recent stay. The drinks were good and we particularly enjoyed the atmosphere and original seating.Unfortunately both food and drink were rather expensive, however this probably wouldn't stop us having a drink here again if we were staying

Made a reservation for two on a Saturday night. Place was not too crowded but all the pod seats were taken up. We were subsequently moved to one when it was available. Had chicken rice set and crayfish skewers both of which were decent and reasonably priced at $15 and $18 respectively There were limited red wines on the menu ranging from $88 to $138 and the captain recommended us some light red wines that were not on the list but felt that they are good and well priced wines. We were happy with his recommendation which costs $88.Only reasons why I did not give full marks:Perhaps we ordered food hence there were no tidbits or snacks givenAt the point of reservation, I was offered a complimentary slice of cake as I mentioned that I was celebrating my 26th anniversary with my galfren. When the cake arrived, it came with a happy birthday message instead of the Happy 26th anniversary which the restaurant earlier on promised in the reservation email. So it turned out to be abit embarrassing but I did not raise it to the staff since it was complimentary
5
This bar has to be one of the best in Singapore and also the longest.The pods over the water have an amazing feel and the whole place just oozes with luxury.Also the staff are so friendly and the bar food has a good selection of bites
5
or a G&T if you prefer. The nibblies are also worth a try so, grab a lobster pot and spend a relaxing evening here. You wont regret it.
5
We stayed at the Pan Pacific Singapore and the Hotel is luxury at its best. The Atrium has bars and places to eat and lounge areas and you can relax.
5
This is such a nice restaurant/ bar! The drinks are amazing and the food is delicious! The service is impeccable and I especially enjoyed talking to Blair!

Stopped by for a quick lunch and had a salad Niçoise. Staff was excellent, nice atmosphere, and good salad. Off to shop across the street!

This is the main bar at the Pan Pacific. It serves everything from breakfast at busy times through to cocktails at 1 pm. The seating is comfortable apart from at the long bar which was clearly built for very small adults. Good sandwiches and high tea available. Amazing views of the hotels interior elevators. Straight out of an old bond movie.
5
The seats are very cosy with plush sofas and cushions. I had the happy hour drinks at an affordable price of SGD 12 ++ for a pint of Heineken and excellent (by far the best) bar bites. The wasabi chips and mixed nuts were great to munch on while the wifi latched strongly onto my laptop for a good few hours

I went to Pan Pacific Singapore again this time for English Afternoon Tea.Staffs are courteous .Waiter came to pour a glass of champagne, then 3 tier tray came in. I examine the items. Nice arrays of pastries, and mini buns, sweet.One look like lollipop. but it is not One thing to note: It is not for diabetic as some items are too sweet.A pot of tea (Lemon ginger ) was nice and aromatic.Will come again for Perankan Afternoon Tea set 
5
When coming down in the mornings for a coffee we would have to walk past the temptation of the patisserie and see all of the fresh cakes and Danish's on display.We eventually succumbed and tried the Black Forrest cake first followed by the Chocolate Fudge cake another day.We can honestly say that they were some of the nicest & moist cakes we have ever tried. It's nice knowing that the Bakery is all in house and made fresh daily and available through all the restaurants in the Pan Pacific Hotel.Both cakes are at a reasonable price of approximately $8-$9 SG each with a Cappuccino and a biscuit costing $7SG. Wished we had tried more

On returning home from a business trip to Singapore, I feel I must pass a comment on how my wife, myself and two business colleagues were treated at The Atrium at Pan Pac. We were greeted by a charming young lady, whose name was Mila, who proved to be the star of the evening. Every question and enquiry was answered perfectly and correctly.Unlike one or two other hotels I might mention in Singapore, the drinks ordered were always correct and served in a very courteous manner, very good cocktails too !! We were never rushed and had a perfectly relaxed evening. Mila had the knack of noticing when another round of drinks were required, and would appear without any prompting, wonderful service indeed. Thank you Mila, you made our evening, also ensuring where we will be staying when we visit Singapore in the not too distant future. If all the staff are as good as this young lady, it is no wonder why the Pan Pacific is busy. The hotel is very lucky to have such wonderful staff. Once again, well done Mila, see you soon

Love the fresh sandwich and salads, they have increased the menu and operating hours. Including several local dishes and a nice breakfast menu. Also great for a quite coffee or break during the day, and now snacks later with a nice cool drink to wind up your day. Staff have always been efficient and friendly
5
If you feel like having a place to chit chat after a long work day, this is the place to be in, cosy and quiet, it's the perfect place to chill out!
5
The staff are friendly, very good lighting, very comfy sitting, not too noisy.
I love the place very much, would definitely come back for more drinks (please try their signature cocktails)!
4
Had time after our meetings for a beer. Really nice ambiance. Cool set up and layout. Service and selection were good, not great.
4
They now have these cool pods. I like that they keep freshening up the Atrium area of the Pan Pacific Hotel in Marina Bay. Can't fault the place, the hostess or the tipple. You do pay for what you get. I'll go again
4
There was just to much food. The cost was 42 SD for one person and there was no way possible to eat that much food available from every country in Asia.
5
Its a nice lounge where you can have drinks, small snacks. You would go there only for the beautiful place, great view.. And not noisy or crowdy..so go for it.
5
We had a very great time at Atruim, Pan Pacific! I've visited this place few months back but I can say that its totally different now. Aside form the cozy and unique place, the service itself is awesome! Cheers to Mr. Aru and his staffs who made us ordinary people feel like a VIP through their excellent service!!! I will definitely come back and put good words to my friends so they can visit a great place like this

Made reservations at the Pan Pacific Orchard for Mother's Day High Tea but mistakenly went to the Pan Pacific Marina location instead. Arrived at the Lobby Lounge and asked for assistance. Astonishing case of "lost in translation" as two female staff members attempted to respond to my queries. When one lady began by glancing at a sheet of paper and handing it to me, I turned to look at my wife in disbelief and knew things were gonna get interesting. What, was it standard protocol for the guest to look up his own name on a sheet of paper??!! Thinking we were still at the right place, we glanced around for a High Tea spread as the two ladies "dumbfoundedly" guided us to our seats. I persisted to question them about our 2pm appointment and one lady responded by pointing to the menu which showed their High Tea start time at 3pm. I got frustrated by their inability to communicate in English. My wife overheard them speaking in Korean!! Told them I just received a call yesterday to confirm my reservation...at 2pm!! Not sure if they understood a word as they stared at me like two deer caught in headlights. While still unsure what was going on, and thinking we had an hour wait, ordered some drinks. I rang the number on my phone from the call received the day before. Someone answered...she spoke perfect English. She confirmed my reservation for 2pm and asked if I would be late. I said, "No, I'm actually seated at the Lobby Lounge right now but two of your staff are saying there's no High Tea at 2pm." She realized I was at the other hotel in the Marina area and said she'd hold my table. As I hung up, one of the ladies showed up with our drinks. Told them we got the hotels mixed up. Deer in headlights. My wife requested for the juices to be packed so the lady began walking off with two full glasses. I gulped up half my Latte and told my wife what was the point. She brought the glasses back. I said just bring us the bill. Paid S$52 for 4 drinks we barely touched in 20 seconds, topped off with some truly incompetent service from a hotel I expect knows better. If I wasn't in such a rush to get to my High Tea appointment, I would have demanded to speak to the manager. Lack of communication is one thing but lack of sensibilities is another. They could have offered to waive off the untouched drinks. I mean, the drinks came...and I asked for the bill. I think I could have convinced her but wasn't in the mood. Sometimes, in these situations, you write off the "bad experience" and just never return. The sad truth is I've always enjoyed the hotel and the buffet at The Edge is top-notch. I've frequented the hotel at least 50 times over the years...but this left me shocked and appalled. If they could speak English, all they had to say was, "There is no High Tea Mother's Day Special going on here" or something to that effect. Instead, they lead me to believe the timing was 3pm instead of 2pm. With the cab fares and drinks, I told my wife we were out a hundred bucks before we even started our High Tea meal. The cab fares I can deal with...it was my mistake after all. The wasted drinks was another. I hope someone at Pan Pacific can justify to me how their Lobby Lounge (which is the most common reception area for hundreds of foreign guests per week) can assign service staff who aren't the least bit proficient in English to greet its guests. I would expect there to have been one person, at the very least, to be able to cover in English. The irony of that day was the fact the service staff at Pan Pacific Orchard (a much smaller hotel) served us impeccably during our High Tea meal. Even the two ladies from China communicated well in English and I told Arjun, one of our servers, I would have expected them to be serving at the more upscale location at Pan Pacific Marina!

We had a couple of clients who were staying in the Pan Pacific Hotel and invited us over for a few drinks once we’d finished working. I hadn’t been since the revamp and was suitably impressed. The interior is really cool and unique, there’s a huge bar and then a very high ceiling which gives the whole place a light and airy atmosphere. The cocktails are also delicious and there’s also a whole range of beers and wines if that doesn’t tickle your fancy

Stayed at the Pan Pacific and visited the ground floor bar a few times while here. The place had lovely ambience, looks modern and up to date. It is a nice place to sit and hang out, its big, plenty of space and not noisy or crowded. Not to say that there aren't any guests, the place can be full but it still somehow seem airy in a way. I love the way they serve their whiskey. In a glass with an ice-scoop. It just looks amazing, cool and really exclusive. The best! I love the fact that the staff all wears different outfits but matching colours, all in black, white and red. It works so well with the interior and the overall ambience. The staff is very attentive, prompt and friendly. I will definitely be back for more drinks on my next stay at the Pan Pacific
