An excellent discovery recently opened a few months ago. The Sushi and Sashimi were very fresh and for the Robotaki or Japanese grill we had fresh air flown from Japan Grouper which was very fresh and tasty, Friendly service and reasonable pricing

When you walk into this corner of Great World City, you feel like you are in Japan. Kuriya, the parent company of these Japanese restaurants at this corner owns all of them. The boss is a Japanese and it explain why the Japanese atmosphere is so authentic.I was there at about 1.30 pm and the restaurant was quite empty. With such a fancy decor an so spacious, I was thinking the food must be expensive. I was pleasantly surprised that the price was actually reasonable considering the quality of the food being served. I have not tried tempura egg before and was wondering how it will turn out. The egg was deep fried with a thin batter coating.What was nice was the egg yoke was still running and not over cooked. It will take some skill to achieve this. The salmon was nicely pan fried and was tender. The Ami Ami Kaisen Don was simply amazing. The scallop was fresh and tender. There was a generous portion of snow crab leg. The flying fish egg row was also fresh. All the sashimi includes were excellent. At $25.80 for the set, it is really a great value for money. Be caution that there is only a limited set served per day.We had a great experience. The staff was attentive and courteous. Will definitely be back

This is casual dining with a main tempura and robatayaki seafood theme by Kuriya. According to the waiting staff, supply seasonal seafood are flown in three times week and as such, some orders in the menu may not be available or are sold out. I ordered a pretty small sized big-eyed red snapper that costs $19 on the waitress' recommendation and the wife ordered a slightly bigger sized threadfin at $32. As the fishes are fresh, we can have it either sashimi style or grilled but we both opted for grilled. Plating of the fishes was pretty. The meat of the snapper was sweet, moist and tender while the threadfin was drier. Overall, both of us preferred the snapper over the threadfin even though it's more expensive. As part of my set meal, I had two grilled prawns as well, and they came so marvelously grilled so that we ordered another set of two prawns. Each prawn costs about $4. So, price-wise, the restaurant is somewhat on the high side but I think it's still value for money as compared to those restaurants who charged an arm and a leg and served junk. We will definitely revisit the restaurant to try out the rest of the menu
