The food is nice. The price is a bit on the upside. I believe that the food commensurate with the price.
4
Ordered the black angus and there was a promotion going on - extra 100g of steak with 200g ordered on Sunday evenings. The steak was well cooked and sufficiently juicy.
4
Had the prawn aglio olio for lunch here and it was delicious. Would definitely come back if in the area.
4
Nice Atlantic salmon and ribeye steak. Enjoyed the panna cotta as part of the set meal as well. Not too busy on the weekday
5
Betterfield is much bigger at their new location. Portions for the food were good and their steaks are value for money!
4
Nice place to go for quiet lunch. Not too crowded. Food is reasonably priced too. I had the spaghetti with lobster & seafood which is good.
5
The steak is just to die for. Value for money and definitely a must-try (go for the grilled ones under the no-frills grill menu, it's better than the oven-baked on on the main menu with the side dishes)
4
Came here on a friends recommendation. Had the set dinner sets which had an offer on Wednesday and ordered the ribeye steak on the side. Food was ok, well presented and ambiance was on the quiet side though seems like customers were always women or a group of girls. Ribeye steak was ok but I probably would not get it again

I always feel bummed when my steaks are so fatty. I'm the kind of person that takes time to cut away the fats that I can remove.... This was the fattiest steak I've eaten in my life & we're not taking marbling. Sad. The previous seared Black Angus Ribeye Steaks ($22++) I'd eaten here were alright; great texture - & today's was no exception in that regard, but dat fat tho.The free raclette promotion also wasn't great - the cheese having hardened already when I tucked in. But, no matter - since it's free & a solid piece, I just moved it to one side.Thankfully, everything else I had other than the fatty steak was good.Not only is there duck fat in the Duck Fat Potatoes ($16++), there is also pulled duck on top of this. Though not crispy like they describe in their menu, this was quite yummy. I find that the cheese & sauce don't do much for this appetiser - the potatoes & duck alone are delicious enough. If you ordered just the steak (which comes with only a salad on the side), this is a great way to get some carbs in.The Truffle Fries ($10++) were devoured in no time, perhaps because we were hungry waiting for our mains, perhaps because the fries were delicious. The shoe string fries were fried to such a crisp, & served with a crazy addictive Truffled Mayonnaise sauce on the side - it was so yummy, we asked for more. I'm always on the fence about calling Truffle Fries "good"; many expect real truffle shavings (!?) or a strong Truffle flavour (not just the smell), but I find that most places don't cater for that.. Not at this price point, anyway. Dessert was ice cream from a little booth near the entrance - the Maple Pecan & Earl Grey Lavender had strong flavours. They also sell ice cream sandwiches where selected flavours are in between a cookie sandwich. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats only Accepts reservations - I used Chope FavePay 10% rebate

The Betterfield was rather empty when I visited on a weekday evening. As it is on High Street, perhaps there is more traffic during lunchtime, but the quiet in the evening suited me well.I was there to try their duck confit and added a hot melted brie as a starter. I like cheese so the brie was nice. The duck confit wasn't the best I've had but it was good. I found it strange that the same berry compote was served with both the starter of the brie as well as with the main. I've heard good reviews of the truffle fries and the duck fat fries. May return to give those a try
4
Decent food. Good service. The set lunch steak was good. I liked the little bell to call for service and the bill. Very convenient.
5
Great food, value for money and good atmosphere for discussions and conversations. Lots of space but still cosy.
5
lovely steak and great value!
Service was great too. Coffee and ice cream was not fantastic but will be back soon to try other dishes!
5
everything here is excellent.
ive made a reservation and was entitled to a 50% off the jacks creek wagyu beef, thou its slightly overcooked but its still tasted excellent.
4
Very delicious! A bit in the pricey side but would definitely come back as the quality is good. Recommend the king prawn aglio olio!
4
Had the beef, was done nicely and taste great. Must try the roasted duck fat potatoes as well. Service staff are alert and friendly.
4
Went on a Sat afternoon and the place was spacious and comfortable. Had some entrees and they were good!
5
My wife and I returned to The Betterfield with the knowledge that their steak was excellent! The crust on the ribeye on immaculate and gave the steak a great texture. The doneness of the steak was spot on! We also discovered that they roast their own coffee now, under the name of Sensuri Coffee Roasters. The number of origins of their coffee beans was extensive, even featuring lesser known regions such as Malawi and Yunnan! Will return to try their coffees soon
4
Enjoyed a quiet evening at The Betterfield. Tried the Jack's Creek Wagyu which came with truffle mustard,and maldon sea salt; tender and medium rare and juicy to perfection. The duck confit was also enjoyable with its berry compote. The restaurant also hosts other private events and parties on one side of the restaurant so they offer a variety of options and is not just a restaurant. They certainly have come a long way from their humble abode in Waterloo Street to the spot beside The Treasury
5
I have always wanted to try The Betterfield out after driving past on a couple of occasions. I decided to give them a go this time. Unlike most establishments with high density seating these days, The Betterfield was very spacious and welcoming! The menu had a decent selection. You must give their truffle fries a go! I absolutely loved their thai milk tea ice cream as well! A must visit if you're in the area
4
Had the 200g waygu beef. beef was well done and the sea salt and mustard to go with it was good. Would be good if there were free sides like fries or salad to go along the beef.
1
The customer service of a restaurant is just as important as the food and the enironment. Unfortunately this place lacks in basic manners and courtesy.
3
Food is normal, service is good. Environment is not bad. The location is convenient during office hours.
3
Price was reasonable for the quality available.
Ordered a platter: lobster tail, scallops (3pcs) , wagyu (100g) riverine (100g), Black Angus (100g)
Sides: Roasted potato, garden salad
Love the Black Angus, no beefy taste
Paid $107 for the above, worth it.
4
I found this restaurant in a food blog and decided to try it out because it was close to my place. I had the Black Angus Ribeye ($22) for their 200g cut, served with their own recipe of Truffle Mustard, Mesclun Salad and topped off with a pinch of Maldon sea salt. The truffle mustard was definitely the highlight of the dish. Would come back again
1
Food was ok but service was terrible. Such a huge restaurant and most of the tables were empty but when we asked for an extra chair for our bags we were rejected with the excuse that they were fully booked for the night. Menu was changed without updating website and a lot of the dishes we wanted to try were no longer on the menu. It’s one of those places I promise not to return.
4
I had the salmon set lunch, which came with mushroom soup and a drink (ice-lemon tea or peach) for under $20. The salmon was well executed and tasty, although the portion was quite small. The mushroom soup was also good. The service staff were polite and "functional". The real plus point is that unlike many restaurants, The Betterfield felt spacious and airy, with tables properly spaced and allows for private conversation.
2
The food not bad but their service was really bad. They’re having 1-for-1 promotion for Wangyu beef, the waitress didn’t had the patience to explain about this promotion and showed us attitude. My friends and I was really pissed off and would not go there again!
3
We made a reservation for 11am but when we got there around 11:10, it was still pitch dark and closed. The waiters seemed to have trouble understanding our orders at times but the food was pretty good. It was really dark in there for some reason though, my friends and I were just looking to try out new brunch/lunch places
4
Parked at Peninsula and walked over (less than 3 mins). It is very spacious and the atmosphere was very welcoming. We had the 1-for-1 wagyu (100g each) for $25. Got it done medium rare and it was perfect. I can foresee myself coming back with friends. Good place to hang out.
4
Good grilled angus beef and octopus! Liked the foie gras and truffle fries too. Garden salad was fresh as well.
4
The service staff were very polite and the pasta was very yummy! The decor of the restaurant also gave a relaxing ambience to the restaurant.
1
Indifferent service and couldn't care less service attitude from inexperienced staff.order took a long time, and came out wrongly served the first time round. The second time, the meat was still raw and frozen.
3
Ordered the steak and it took more than 30 minutes to arrive. The steak tasted above average though, considering the price I'm paying.
3
Found this place through some blogger's recommendation, was quite disappointed with the steak.
Truffle fries was good, huge portion (big enough for more than 3) and nice truffle taste.
4
The beef is quite well prepared with the desired doneness. Reasonable for the price. Mostly we head there for slight pocket-friendly good beef. :)

Brought my friends who visited from KL, right after we finished touring the Yayoi Kusama exhibition (which was extremely trippy). We were famished! I really wanted to try the lunch set unfortunately since it was a public holiday, it wasn't available...anyway we went ahead to order appetizers to share (pops mentaiko chicken & roasted duck fat potato) and we each ordered a different entrÃ©e. Chef Shaun came out to introduce himself and to explain the new menu they just launched. We really appreciated his recommendation and comments! We were excited to try his food.The appetizers were good! My fav was the pop chicken which I understand the chicken is from Japan. It was so perfectly cooked and crunchy as heck. I wish there was more! The duck fat potatoes were good but I'm not a huge duck fan...so it felt a bit rich for me. My husband had the crispy panko chicken burger, and it was really satisfying and cooked perfectly (obviously I had a bite!). We would definitely go back for this again!! My friend Jo ordered the duck confit (the berry compote went well with the duck I think)...her bf had the pulled duck burger (I didn't try it but it must have been yummy as he devoured it immediately). Unfortunately my dish came out the last - the mentaiko scallop pasta. It was delicious and light, just what I needed. Although looking back I wish I ordered the chicken burger!So all in all the food was quite good, but I think perhaps they can improve more on the presentation. The flavors were there but more evident in some dishes. I don't know why but the most memorable dishes for me were the chicken burger and the chicken pops. I think you should make more fried chicken dishes, Chef Shaun! (I was sad they removed the Korean fried chicken from the menu...) My husband and I will probably try the food here again :
4
Came here again for their steak. The first time I had it, it was mind blowing. The second time was rather meh though. The meat was very veiny and rubbery. My jaws were so tired from all the chewing and bits and pieces of meat were stuck in between my teeth. Not sure whether I will return for a third visit
3
apart from the beef, the rest of the items were really so so. was also a little upset that we were told corkage is free, but when we brought our own bottle the waitress attempted to charge us until we cleared things up with the manager
4
Had 200g black Angus medium rare beef (cos their Canterbury was sold out) and for $22, it's not too bad I must say. The trademark is the thin layer of charred skin that makes it unique and flavourful. The meat was juicy, though a little too fat in my opinion. The coffee was good. I didn't have to add sugar for my vanilla latte. Service staff were friendly and nice, though their response time can be a little faster, but overall it was Went on a weekend so it's quiet. Conducive for big groups. They serve ice cream cookies too
3
The food was average, and at a time where there was so little people, they took really long to serve my food :(
4
2nd time visiting the restaurant, like the quiet atmosphere that is rare these days. Perfect for informal gathering or date.
4
The beef steak was tender and melt in your mouth! Prices were also very reasonable. Must try! Need to walk a bit from City Hall mrt
5
Besides they are giving good steak, you should try out their pasta and risottos. Welcoming as always, food was great as usual.
3
Came here for a coffee today after lunch nearby. A little expensive at $6 a cup and fairly average in terms of flavour. On the plus side there were plenty of empty tables. Didn't try the food.
4
I've been here for both brunch and dinner. In both instances, the restaurant was mostly empty, so the service we received was very attentive.The steak here is delicious, and done very well. The flavor of the meat really shines through and it's quite enjoyable to watch the steak getting seared just before it's served.The seafood mac n cheese is underwhelming, and neither the seafood aspect of it nor the mac n cheese aspect of it is very memorable. The truffle fries were fairly standard in flavor but very crisp. Nearly all their desserts are brilliant.All in all, the experience was more or less worth the money
4
BRONZE Steak (Black Angus or Canterbury): 200g @ $22, 300g @ $32, 400g @ $40Asked for medium rare, came out BEAUTIFUL. This is the 200g portion. Great texture, amazing flavour, & the slightly tangy sauce made it perfect. I don't care much for the salad, it was alright I guess. (Give me meat any day!!) The last time I went to Betterfield, they were still at Waterloo Street. I don't remember the steak tasting so delicious, i.e. this is a marked improvement - hooray! Mentaiko Superior Japanese Scallops Pasta ($25+)Portion was small, I was still hungry after this. But it was tasty & the scallops were fresh. The mentaiko sauce is salty BUT I say this only if you're licking the plate at the end (oops I just baotoh-ed myself). Mixed with the pasta, it's not crazy salty. I love pasta, but the steak was a lot more satisfactory than the pasta so that's what I'd go with.

I did not have high hopes for this restaurant at first. It looked like it was run by a bunch of kids. Ordered 200g of black angus beef ($22) and was blown away by the taste. The meat was paired with truffle paste and salt. It felt like I was eating a $50-60 kind of beef. Burpple promo till 31 July- you can get the dish for only $15
5
Great experience! The staff are friendly, the call system make it easy to call them from your table, food is nice. They even helped to prepare a little surprise for my girlfriend upon my additional request. Thank you so much! Will definitely be back in the future :

We tried this restaurant for lunch. They offered lunch specials priced from $16.90 to $19.90. Each set comes with a drink and a cup of soup. There is a variety of lunch special choices. I tried the spicy oven-baked chicken set. The serving was small with small piece of chicken, small serving of salad and 3 potato wedges. It could be set lunch price serving? Service which used to be waiting for the service staff to spot you is now slightly better as the restaurant installed a buzzer on each table that allows you to call for service or bill. Average experience...
4
Tried the steak which was really quite tasty, but it was a little expensive. Risotto was not very good though. The place is very spacious and comfortable. Probably a good place to have a cup of coffee, but better value meals can be found elsewhere.
5
The food was delicious and they offered a range fo coffee beans and teas for caffeine lovers. Great cafe to relax and chat with friends
5
Patronize the place regularly as the lunch set meals are a great deal and the steak prices are really affordable. Shaun the owner is really friendly and comes around to ask how things are.
5
The place is spacious & quiet enough for gathering. We ordered few platters of steaks, pasta and sides like truffle fries and fried chicken. The steak is considered one of the best in Singapore, I believe.
4
It's a good and quiet place for dating and catching up with friends. The pasta, burger and steaks were delicious.
3
Had the scallop mentaiko spaghetti and the furikake prawn spaghetti - both were good but the prices were on the high side. Cafe was empty when we dined on a Sunday evening. Good for long quiet chats.
3
Ordered the black angus steak (medium rare) and it was tough and lacked flavour. Had high hopes for their hot melted brie as the pictures online look so good. But the crust was hard and dry. The restaurant was huge but was sparse and had a casual cafe ambience. The toilet was pretty horrible. It seemed like they forgot about doing up the toilet when they started this restaurant. It was more befitting of an industrial building. The flush was spoilt too.
4
Went with my family. As there were a number of us, we could order several items. We had the truffle fries, Saute Mushroom And Spinach for starters. Both were quite nicely done.We had the duck confit, Panko Chicken Burger, Italian mushroom risotto, squid ink spaghetti, mentaiko scallop spaghetti. We also had the Korean Chicken Wings for side (garlic soy and Indo Chilli). I did not try all of them but I had tasted better duck confit. As for the rest, there were quite some compliments especially for the Panko Chicken Burger. Overall, I think the food did not disappoint. I think the decor is pretty bare so it is not a place that entice you to sit for long
3
Visited during lunch and tried the Louisiana Chicken Sandwich lunch set and ordered a side of their Ultimate Italian Truffle Fries. The fries were well coated with truffle oil and the side of truffle mayo dip made it better. While the sandwich sauce was good, the chicken was on the dry side
5
They grill it in front of you, good value for money, and the staff are friendly. The venue itself is very spacious and well lit. Good for business lunches or couple dinners. FYI: they don't serve alcohol in case you are looking for a bottle wine to go with your steak.
4
2nd visit within the same week. Staff had good service attitude compared to the staff from my previous visit 3 days back. Enjoyed the food recommendations. If only food portions were larger.
4
The food is nice but not the atmosphere. Had their pull duck and squidink salted egg pasta. Both taste good but the decoration is average.
4
Came here recently with a colleague for some coffee after a lunch at a nearby restaurant. The coffee was actually pretty decent, and the service was good also. Probably worth another visit some time.
3
Soup & salad were served promptly however we waited for almost an hour for the main course :( food was great but i think the chef/owner cannot cope with the overwhelming crowd. Still prefer the old location when there was only about 8tables
4
Had valentine's day special at their cosy town outlet. Food especially the steak and fondant was delicious. Ambience leaves much to be desired but good value for money definitely made up for it.
4
Food was not bad. Had the mac and cheese. Service and atmosphere was nice and cosy. Would go back there again.
4
Steak was superb went for the Riverine as recommended by the owner of the restaurant and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. Ordered sides to share such as the duck fat potatoes and pop mentaiko chicken which were super delicious. Service was a bit slow, but staff were polite and apologetic when they forgot our order, would definitely revisit this place again
3
Hi, we wanted to try the wagyu promotion for their anniversary which is why we ended up at this place. I must say the wagyu was done exactly to what we wanted and a decent cut. Very good. However that is about the only good thing here. The Korean friend chicken wings we ordered was 6 pieces and 1 is the wing and the other the drumlet, so technically 3 wings for a whopping $12. There was no alcohol in the afternoon, and the service was really very basic, nothing fantastic. So I dont see myself back cos the food will remain expensive but I am not getting an ambience nor fantastic service
3
I went on a Saturday for lunch with a friend, just 2 of us. It was not crowded, restaurant is quite spacious, simple and comfortable setting. We ordered 3 dishes, truffle fries, Japanese mentaiko scallop spaghetti and squid ink salted egg spaghetti. Fries was good, mentaiko spaghetti was average and squid ink salted egg taste weird.
2
Food was of acceptable standard. However, I had to wait 30mins after I placed my order just to get my drinks served. Thereafter, I waited another 20mins before I got my starters. Than, I had to to another 50mins to get our main course and 20mins after that for the desserts. In between, I had to check on my orders thrice. I understand it was valentine's day and it was quite crowded. But, given that the menu variety was very little, I do not see how simple things like pouring 2 glasses of drinks can take 20mins. In addition, when I asked one of the staff what was causing all the delay. It came to my attention that some order slips were misplaced on the counter and that the kitchen were confused. There were 2 tables next to me who were there before me but got their food later and 1 table who came later and got their food first.I do hope the management can do something about this and give priority to those who came first, especially since most of us made reservations beforehand
