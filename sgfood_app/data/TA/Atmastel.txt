Service was okay, my group (of 6) was well attended. I had their grilled fish I thought it was good, the portion was small but I guess this is standard for Italian food? It was almost empty during lunch.

I am not an expert on italian food but what I ordered with my daughter hit the jackpot. A wonderful meal of one of their Pizzas and topped it off with their portugese egg tarts was one of the highlights of my trip to Singapore. Will definitely come again in my next visit to Singapore. 5 stars for me.

They had offer for $2 for one oyster. We ordered a dozen, they were not fresh. They were precooked with boiling water. It tastes so weird. I ordered two glasses of prosecco, they didn’t use champagne glasses. They used white wine glasses, so freaking unprofessional. The price of the food and drink are overpriced. Don’t go if you want real Italian food

I was staying at the JW Marriott and wanted to try this since the menu sounded really italian. The place looks simple and modern in style but when you look at the menu and special of the day you feel excited. Will they deliver on the promise ?They did. I had an excellent pizza and tiramisu. I enjoyed so much that I came back the following day before going to the airport and had focaccia and prosciutto crudo and a glass of prosecco: I felt at home. The chef came to me to ask if I was italian and we then started a little conversation.If you are looking for good italian food do miss this one

A Friday night dinner with friends. Food was surprisingly delicious and appealing.Restaurant has good table sizes to accommodate groups gathering (surprisingly the noise level wasn't that bad in the restaurant). Staff service was responsive, attentive & amicable. We have our water cups filled up w/o us asking. Food presentation was decent and food quantity is reasonable.Food pricing on the higher end side but i guessed with the ambience and food quality, I can compromise on that part. I like the idea of seating arrangement to be able to view the kitchen and chefs working. Location of the restaurant was accessibly located ( 15-20 steps from Esplanade MRT exit ) . Overall dining - Great. Will introduce to my frenzs and family ( provided the restaurant maintains the same good service and food quality level as mentioned in my review

I literally cannot review this restaurant accurately as I cannot seem to get any service. I've been sitting at my table for 25 minutes. Not one person has come to give me service. I entered the restaurant and was seated at 9:50pm and it is now 10:24pm. However, the tables on either side of me have received service during that time. It's not like it's a large place. There are only 16 tables and only 11 are occupied. I'm one of the 11. Avoid this place as you'll just waste your time sitting at a table as if you're invisible and you'll leave hungry.My experience also doesn't bode well for the quality of their food. I can't even speak about the food as they didn't even allow me the courtesy of an order.

We were staying at JW Marriott hotel, and were looking for a reasonable place to eat dinner nearby. This restaurant is just steps from the hotel in a covered outdoor mall area, so it worked perfectly for us. Unfortunately they did not have seats available for walk-ins inside, but the outdoor area was fine in the evening. We enjoyed some cocktails and beer, but did not partake of appetizers, since we were trying to keep costs reasonable. Singapore is a pretty expensive place!, especially this neighborhood. This restaurant was not overly expensive, but fit in with other flashy/trendy places nearby. At our table we had the sausage pasta, the meat board, grilled veggies, and another pasta dish, although I cannot remember exactly which one. Overall we thought the food was very high quality, with really exquisite bold flavors. The grilled veggies were maybe less appealing than the other dishes, but were still prepared well. We would certainly recommend Atmastel to anyone in the area looking for a casual but high-quality Italian dining experience, although maybe not worth coming into the city just to eat here. There are many other bars and restaurants nearby, so it is very convenient to eat here and and have drinks/desserts, or go shopping nearby. There aren't any direct views to enjoy from this restaurant, as it is actually below street level, but the location itself is close to many other malls and activities on the North Bay/Raffles area

Great food. Chef comes to the table and talk to you. Service was okay and little knowledge on wine offerings. Placing wine glasses on beer coaster. Light setting in the restaurant is not really romantic. The zuppa di pesce is delicious

We went to Atmastel on a recommendation from the doorman at the hotel where we were staying. The service was excellent and ambience of the restaurant was good. We were recommended a red wine and whilst expensive it was a good drop. We thought that the meal prices were on the high side but they were enjoyable. The four cheese pizza - tasty with a very thin and crispy base. The meat balls were enjoyed, but very "meaty" in flavour. The duck ragu and pasta, whilst quite small was very tasty.When we received the bill we pointed out to the Maitre d' that they had not charged us for the wine. Apart from a thank you, there was no offer of reducing the cost or complimentary drink - which I thought would have been a nice gesture on their part - as there are some who would not have been so honest

Service was alright, nothing out of the ordinary. Prices on the menu and dining environment don't tally. Extremely expensive pizzas (even though I have to say that ingredients were definitely very fresh) - still... not worthwhile. The most popular drink according to the service staff was the Sangria, so we ordered that and it came with "fresh fruits" that were preserved from a can and tasted like syrup mixed wine.Not worth a penny spent

The restaurant was located near the MRT station. The restaurant was stylish and modern in decoration. Although it was just 5pm, most of the tables indoor had reserved signs on. This month of May the restaurant was having 1-for-1 promotion for its pizza, when one signed up for its complimentary member card. Black Truffle Pizza ($48++)Mozzarella, Black Truffle, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Grana PadanoAlthough the pizza crust looked thin, it was soft and chewy inside, similar to sourdough bread. The buffalo mozzarella was soft and spreadable. Nice smell of truffle oil.Seafood Pizza ($38++)San Marzano Tomato Sauce, Clams, Squids, Prawns, Garlic, Chilli Flakes and ParsleyThe tomato sauce was a tab too sour for me, but it made up for the plentiful of juicy seafood around

Dinner at Atmastel was nothing to scream about. The clam and bottaga pasta and the creamy sausage pasta were ordinary, and the meatball dish was tasteless. They seemed more homecooked than restaurant standard bearing in mind the dishes were not cheap. This will be the first and my last time at Atmaste

The food wasn't particularly memorable - don't remember exactly what I ate, but remember enjoying my salad and 1 for 1 pints of beer. I think I had a four cheese pizza and didn't leave any on the plate. It seemed that on at least 2 or 3 nights of the week they had their 1 for 1 pizza sign out front - which means buy one get one free. That's what they call it in Singapore: 1 for 1. One of the many things I learned in Singapore. I like the way when you ask a Singaporean for something they say "can, can, can.

Was over at South Beach with a friend the other evening and stopped by Atmastel as heard some good things about the place. We grabbed a bucket of the Menabrea lager an Italian beer with a pleasant fruity taste making a great change from the usual bottled stuff available in Singapore. We accompanied this with some light bites and a pizza. The pizza was the La Piccante which included a spicy (apparently homemade) sausage and the base crust was very good. For the light bites we had Totopos, which were really crisp and not oily at all. This came with Habanero sauce that was the spicy side of spicy but that will suit most Singaporean tastes. Our server came and offered us more sauce later which was just as well as my friend had taken a great liking to it and was smothering the corn chips with huge dollops. In addition we had truffle fries, the potato was crisp on the outside and soft in the centre and the truffle salt was not overly salty so the truffle taste was very evident. In general the serving staff were quite efficient especially by Singapore's very mixed standards. Later on I talked to a gentlemen who was the owner and he was explaining the lengths they go to in order to get authenticate ingredients from Italy. So if you're an Italian expat in Singapore you should go and get a taste of home! Looking around at the main courses being served they seemed very tempting so will make the effort to return soon for dinner

Nice place. The outside terrace is nice, less noisy and less cold ! Nice staff. The pizza are very good. It is a bit pricy from my point of view. As a marguerita start around 25sgd++ if I am not wrong... But I will come back the pizza taste great !

We were seriously disappointed here after reading some good reviews. We ordered a pizza and pork as our mains. The pork arrived over 30 minutes later than the pizza. When we followed up we were told we should have known the porkWould take longer...it was then very ordinary and layered with salt. Afterwards the Staff said they were apologising on behalf of their operations manager...(who was standing by the door and too good to deal with the customers or apologise themselves). Won't be back

I am a frequent visitor to this restaurant, it's the first time I write a review on this restaurant. I wanted to highlight how warm and friendly the service is, as well a being very helpful in explaining the menu. The food is excellent, I had the lamb , it was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Quite original olive crust twist to the lamb chop. A simple dish of Arancini was delicious & aperfect blend of rice and quality cheese. The quality of the ingredients comes out on every dish and in my opinion a key reason why the food is so delicious. Great Italian requires top quality ingredients, that's what makes dishes special and quite different to many restaurants who "skimp" on the quality of ingredients

Sorry to disagree with all those who raved about this place. It serves quite ordinary food that you can get anywhere. The chefs are NOT Michelin starred, they worked as a sou chef (someone who cuts vegetables) at a 2 star restaurant and also in a group that has within the group a 3 star. That doesn't make them Michelin starred chefs. And you can tell by the quality of the food. Nothing special, just ordinary. Further, they charge $2 for parmesan cheese for your pasta, which is shocking (although they took it off the bill when I loudly protested). And the dish we went there to try, although on the menu, isn't being served. All in all, not a bad experience, but you can do much better
