Food is decent for the price. Interestingly the restaurant is very busy, which I reckon is sorely due to the lack of good Japanese food in Raffles Place which I struggle to find. As it's very packed, service level was less than ideal

A good & easy to locate location, cozy place, friendly staff. Food a little pricey & their sashimi can be fresher.

Service was rude and rushed and abrasive.
Not impressed with the food tuna was not fresh and server did not care about the feedback.
Soba was not up to average standard. Disfactory experience :(

Value for money lunch sets! Fpod quality is excellent. Service is good. It is often crowded and you would have to reserve early to avoid disappointment. Otherwise you run the risk of queueing to get a seat.

We went during peak lunch hour. Service was good and we get our food fast though that was for lunch set only. Ala Carte seems to take longer. Food was good and price reasonable. Overall pleasant experience.

Helmed by Derrick Lau, perviously from Nadaman, Shangril-La, this place serves good japanese fare. The sashomi and sushi are fresh. We also love the Wagyu Bento (和牛弁当); flavourful slices of medium rare well-marbled beef served with steaming rice. An unusual delish dish is the Sakura Ebi and Mentaiko Capellini of delectable strands of al dente pasta infused with the savouriness of the shrimps and roe. The pleasantly sweet (+3.5) Kiku Masamune Nama (菊正宗 生貯蔵酒) offers good value at $28.00 for a 300ml flask. Will be back

Chef always overwhelms me with his food and presentation!! It’s never the sane experience and every time exceptional! Outstanding food; the ingredients so fresh and the taste and richness of each ingredient is fully on your taste buds; the level and layering of each ingredient combined into a powerful oneness! As always everyone is impressed and blown away about the food. The Resturant is not overly luxurious but very comfortable and warmth. The service sincere.

If you love Japanese food like I do then you should visit here, we had Omakese for lunch so we could concentrate on talking, turn out to be a smart move each course was in flat out competition to outshine the previous one. I could go on and on! Only downside is it’s a bit tight for space and desperately needs a sound absorbing baffle as the surfaces are all hard and the noise of happy chatter just reverberates round the place!Definitely plan to go again!

Not an ideal place for business lunch or dinner. Overly noisy and no privacy for a private room as well. However, the sashimi was excellent and presentation of each Omakase dish was nice. Not enough staffs and staffs should not be shouting across the table and so on..... Liked a market place. Probably could consider to install a layer of Rockwool/ armourflex and mineral ceiling board to absorb the noise. For private room, consider a partition or maybe a curtain for privacy purpose.

Really good Japanese cuisine. I had the cod which was delicious, however, the portion size was relatively small. I'd recommend the udon which my friends got as it was very good and the portion size was a lot bigger and filling. The restaurant's ambiance is very nice and cozy and the service was also good. A hidden gem

Excellent food. Highly recommend the Angel Hair Pasta, Wagyu Beef, Ume Jelly. Staff are polite and service oriented.

Though the restaurant was crowded, very prompt service by the servers. Quality of food is wonderful. Will recommend friends to go!

Nice place to catch up with friends and colleagues. Affordable lunch set. Checkout their fresh sashimi!

What a pleasant discovery. An excellent meal of sashimi and chirashi sushi coupled with excellent service amidst busy lunch time crowd. Enjoyed every morsel and grain of rice. Indeed worth re-visiting again. A must for foodies.

Every visit never fails. Ingredients are fresh, taste is consistently good. Set lunch is definitely value for money and a sweet end with a cup of green tea icecream.

Went there for the first time in 2014 and found the experience to be great. Went back again to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday and it did not disappoint!

The food is of good quality and tasty. Do use Chope as it is popular with weekday lunch crowd. Pricing is reasonable.

We have visited Japan multiple times and are not always impressed by Japanese restaurants in Singapore. It is hard to find good quality Japanese food at a reasonable price. Ambience was quiet and service attentive. The Omekase at $68 was good value. The cod and sashimi was excellent. We added Hida beef which was extra but well worth it. Would definitely come back again.

The food is really, truly run of the mill. Tables are minuscule. Service is attentive. While prices are reasonable, why bother when there are so many more interesting alternatives? That seems to be the conclusion of most customers, as you can almost always find a table there

Good service, tasty food, lots of choices. It's for birthday lunch and staff surprised us with birthday dessert, unexpected and appreciated.

Nice cosy place. Like the friendly staff and good food. Convenient place to meet friends for weekday lunch as it is near Telok Ayer MRT station.
5
Excellent food, though tables could be a tad to close for business meetings. But a great find nonetheless!

Ordered the gindara set n it was properly done with well flavoured sauce. But the chicken karage was hard. Had the black sesame ice cream and it was nice!
5
this place serves seasonal fish and very well affordable. the ambience is ok but the food and quality made up for it.
5
Had the lunch set of Hot Plate udon with Ebi and california roll here. The udon was good. There is even Matcha ice cream for the 1st 30 customers.
Do try to make a reservation if you have more than 2 going

good location just a min walk from the telok ayer mrt. the restaurant is pretty longish and narrow. the menu is pretty good, not too pricey. there were 2 of us and we ordered 2 appetisers n 2 bento sets which came rather too quickly. the table is a tad small but the staff was able to transfer some of the salad into a smaller bowl. food quality is ok. i had the unagi, tempura and sashmi set which was nice. the tempura batter is good and light. my friend had the sliced beef and tempura set. the decor is pretty nice, and has a private room for 4+4 seater. it was a bit noisy as it was rather full. we were there for dinner

We are a party of 6 and we arrived at about 7pm for dinner. As we had made reservations, we were given a room all to ourselves. We ordered the Omakase set accompanied by sake. The sashimi was noted to be fresh and the grilled fish of the day (cod) was nicely done. The soup was delicious and the dessert was wine-flavoured jelly with fruits. Service was good and we were well taken care of, maybe because the restaurant was not crowded on a Thursday evening. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner.

I have to say I went during rush hours over lunch time. The prices are reasonable and the food is good. Fish is very fresh. However the service is average. No much attention to details in servicing.I almost got scolded for asking a spoon twice given that the first time the spoon provided was the large one (soup) and the second time I explained it was needed because it was missing on the plate completely...After all I can understand the rush hours but attitude towards clients should be improved.

i have had japanese food in singpore in many restaurants, some really fancy, some very expensive and among all of them, this is my most favorite restaurant. the chef is a malaysian, worked his way up to become what he is today, knows every single detail of the food he serves. i would eat his omakesei as he always serves you the best in the season. very reasonably priced and it is a must eat place if you like japanese food
