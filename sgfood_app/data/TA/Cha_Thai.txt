The food was slightly on the higher end. We had the boat noodles but it was not as good as it was expected to me making it not as worth it for the price.

Super authentic and delicious Thai food. Expensive but it's nice to pamper yourself once awhile. Will definitely go back again!

The food is good overall, esp the toast. Some are too sweet and the portion is very big haha. It is quite pricey too

All in all a good lunch here with a friend, Green Curry was excellent as were the spring rolls, very very tasty

We emailed ahead regarding their famous prawn clay pot but unfortunately no one received the email so on arrival we were told they were sold out. Not a problem, we thought we could try a bunch of other items on the menu. Four of us tried to order 6 different dishes. Of those 6, only two were available. One of those was the plain rice. Perhaps we will try again when there is some food to actually try

Cha Thai recently celebrated their 2nd Birthday. To be able to survive and thrive in Singapore CBD for more than 2 years definitely no simple feat. Cha Thai simply prove that Singapore market can appreciate Quality Thai Food served here. Gearing towards the 3rd year, Owner and Executive Chef Leah Sirijindapan has been active in creating new cuisine, while retaining the old time favourites. Signature Tiger Prawn “Panang” Curry ($28). One of the signature dishes at Cha Thai. The tiger prawns cooked in rich creamy curry and lychee. A touch of saffron adds the extra OOMPH to this dish. Previously, the prawns are cooked to about 85% so you can taste the “Uni” like mushiness in the prawns. Unfortunately, Cha Thai customers still unable to accept this so Chef Leah relented and cooked the prawn to 100%. For those who like their prawns to have the texture like the BBQ river prawns in Thailand, you might want to let the service staff know you want “the original” version when you order, as we will definitely order the original version on our next trip there. Part of the starters Creamy Crab Roll ($15) & Crispy Prawn Cake ($15). The crispy crab roll consist of deep fried spring roll sticks served with the crab cream sauce. The sticks are crispy to be eaten with rich, creamy crab cream sauce. Thai version of chips with dips. The crispy prawn cake is made in house at Cha Thai. It's crisp exterior followed by springy juicy succulent chopped prawns internally. It is served with sweet sauce however, it is tasty enough on its own. For the Cha Thai soup, we tried Tom Kha Chicken Soup ($18) and Tom Yum Soup – Thick Base ($28 with soup refill). Creamy and milky coconut soup that filled with the aroma spice of galangal, kaffir lime leaves and lemongrass, serving together with chicken, mushrooms and cabbages. Tom Kha Chicken Soup is not that spicy but you have to watch out for the floating bird's eye chillies.With many Thai restaurants always trying to compete for its spiciness in their Tom Yum Soup, the one in Cha Thai is much better, as their soup base is thick and aromatic with its spices, and the flavour of the soup is filled with the freshness taste of the enormous huge tiger prawns and plump mussels. Two thumbs up for those who love the original Thai Tom Yum Kung.Simmer Pork ($22). This is the upgraded version of Thai style pork knuckle. Chef Leah sous vide the pork knuckles marinated with Ovaltine over long period. Yes, apparently, Ovaltine is the secret to pork stew in Thailand. The result is the fall of the bone pork legs and evenly marination that penetrated meat and skin. Yum Yum!! Tiger Prawns Glass Noodle Claypot ($55). This is the refined version compare to the one served in Thailand. The claypot is oiled nicely with pork lard and the rest of the ingredients cooked with herbs, ginger, pepper and spring onions. The glass noodle is silky, springy and soaks up the flavour of the prawns and spices. The prawns are fresh and crunchy. Some might say it can do with more pepper corn, but we find it to be just right. Of course, you can't miss out on their Pad Thai ($22). The al-dente rice noodle cooked with prawn broth and infused with sweet and tangy flavour. The large dried prawns add a solid umami taste to the dish while the sides of peanuts, green mango and raw bean sprouts to add the crunchy texture to this dish. The Pad Thai comes with a large tiger prawn, to add to the WOW feel in this dish. This time around we tried their Boat Noodle ($18). A luxurious version of Boat Noodle. The thick soup base is boiled over a long period with more than 15 type of herbs. The result is thick, rich, robust and gelatinous broth that will make you slurping for more. The rice noodle is thin and crunchy goes well with succulent pork. One heck of delicious noodle indeed. Desserts were Yam Taro Coconut Sago ($6.90) and Red Ruby Coconut Granita ($6.90). Both homemade desserts use coconut milk, the Red Ruby has crunchy and refreshing texture, while the yam taro has creamy and mushy feel to it. It depends on what your liking, I personally like their red ruby. Not forgetting Signature Cha Thai Toast ($8). Their new version comes with cube Charcoal Toast instead of just the Golden Toast. The dippings are Pandan and Thai Tea. The golden toast has a slightly charred flavour that goes well both dipping sauce. However, the charcoal toast has a deeper bitter charred flavour that brings up extra sweetness in the dipping sauces. It was actually a pleasant evening during this invited tasting at Cha Thai. Chef Leah and her team still cook luxurious and delicious Thai Cuisine that they made from scratch. No doubt the price here is higher than normal Thai restaurant, but considering the quality that Cha Thai served you, it is definitely worth your money. Cheers!

Came here for lunch with a friend who works in the neighbourhood. Initially I thought this was going to be one of those new trendy type place, Thai fusion, over-priced and no good, but actually they serve standard Thai food as we know it, and the quality wasn't bad either.Enjoyed the Tom Kha Kai that I ordered. The stir-fried baby kailan was good too.It is more pricey than usual but I think worth it

Cha Thai, Located at Far East Square 80 Telok Ayer St. Newly opened, its clean and modern... serving authentic Thai dishes, The food tastes great and is made from quality ingredients, I enjoyed all the food that we tried especially the Pad Thai it was outstanding .You could say that it’s one of the Best Thai Food in Singapore The pricing is definitely higher than average but I guess you are paying for the quality of the dishes served here. The true highlight of the night was definitely the food, it was absolute perfect. Big plus also go to the Staff, very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Thai cuisine. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon

Recommend by Friend. Been to many other Thai restaurant and this is by far the most authentic. The Chef there was really nice as one of my Friend want to have a tom yum fried rice which was not on the menu. They still able to cook for my Friend. Definitely will be back to try other dish
3
we went here for friends gathering, and i always pass by the place and see crowds in here. we ordered the pad thai, fried rice, fish cakes, papaya salad, the toast with custard sauce . everything is ok, but the nicest food i feel would be the toast. price wise, its quite expensive compared to other thai restaurant but i can see they put more effort in the quality of the food
3
Food was not bad but I ferlyn the mains are slightly overpriced. The toast bread and this milk tea is reasonable and yummy
2
Food was overpriced and in small quantity. Cafe was slightly overcrowded due to the recent food blogger featured. Certainly not worth a second try
5
Food was surprisingly good. Portions are big - be warned. We ordered salad and asked if they have it. They said yes but in the end, we had to ask twice before not having our salad
4
I was there for lunch with colleagues. We order a green chicken curry, Thai fish cakes, Kai Lan with roast pork and Thai basil minced pork. The food was authentic and delicious. They offer both white and brown rice options. We had ice lemongrass tea which was refreshing. The restaurant is very plain and simple in decor. Most people eat and run. It doesn't have a cosy feel about the place. Service staff is Thai. Our lunch came up to $120 which is a bit on the pricey side given it's week day lunch and ambience almost canteen like

DH and I came here for a weekday lunch. The location is in or near the CBD so there's a lot of business people there. It's easy to find and the decor is nothing to write home about. The menu is odd - extensive but still missing lots of Thai staples like no kway teow. Neither of us enjoyed our entrees. The thing that really irked me was the pomelo salad. It said there were pieces of cooked shrimp in it - which was expected. But the shrimp were raw - like they were making ceviche. If I want raw shrimp I'll order it, thank you. And not only was it way too spicy - there were thousands of pieces of shredded lemongrass in it. It was old, hard lemongrass and was absolutely inedible. But because the pieces were cut so small you couldn't even pick it out. It made each bite impossible to swallow. Between the raw seafood they didn't disclose, the over the top spiciness and the lemongrass meant to choke me it's like they couldn't decide how best to torture me. That's why I think the kitchen staff hates the people who eat there. Which would actually make sense given the behavior of the wait staff...They were downright irritated we were even there. Like it was an imposition to be bothered with us. I think all the employees just didn't want people there and between the food and the service that might be best. Enough of that! I'm never going back..

Gave it a try after seeing some reviews. My tomyang noodle was over cooked and soggy and soup was a tad too sweet. Good mix of mussels, prawns and squid though. Friend's fried rice looks normal except that it has a slightly bigger prawn that compensated it. Too pricey for such quality which maybe they used the seafood to compensate?
4
Tomyum soup was yummy- flavourful, spicy and refillable but quite pricey at $28 as ingredients are quite little. Had the pineapple red curry as well $18 and it was coconutty and tasty. Rice $2 per bowl, like how they give white/brown rice as options. Tried the charcoal toast with milk tea dip for desserts.. yummy and not too sweet!
2
Had a weeknight dinner at 7pm and the staff seemed put off by serving customers. The overall interaction was quite rude and inpatient. By 8pm the staff was cleaning the floors with a heavily scented cleaning solution (strong smell of lysol) with tables still dining. We were not even interested in dessert as we lost our appetite due to the chemical smell. The food was good, but totally overpriced for portions and location/setting. I would rather go to Sabai on the water and pay the same price for marina views, friendly staff, same quality food and a nicer atmosphere. Such a shame - I was enticed by the lovely pics on instagram, but would not recommend it to friends, even for lunch

Decided to try their Pad thai as most of the reviews are raving about it.Pad thai comes in a generous portion with 2 huge prawns. Prawns are fresh and huge but slightly overcooked. Furthermore, it is still too sweet for my liking. Their homemade crispy prawn cakes on the other hand are really tasty. Very crispy from the outside and juicy inside. Homemade iced tea is also refreshing and fragrant. its a casual dining environment with courteous staff
2
As highlighted by most of the reviews, this is one overrated and expensive thai food outlet (i don't even consider that as a restaurant) along Telok Ayer.The set lunch was ridiculously expensive with limited rice items. Portion was small and the taste was so ordinary except for the level of spiciness that makes one think you are paying for the spices.The egg noodles did not go down well with me as well. Soup base was not strong enough and it came with a weird combination of soft boiled egg and mince meat, which i have never see anything like that in Thailand. It makes me wonder if this was a convenient and lazy way to prepare such a simple dish. Did i mention it cost a whopping 18 dollars? I could have the same dish in Bangkok at 6 times cheaper.The drinks and snacks items are predictable as well, even though the taste are passable.To summarise, head over to Amoy Street Food Centre for much more flavorful Thai food at a fraction of the price in Cha Thai during off-peak hours and i am sure you will never want to visit them again.Definitely not returning if the quality and variety of the food do not justify the exorbitant price
3
The foods that i order was great but slightly overprice and i think the services can do better. overall still okay.
5
Staff were very courteous and we love the food, especially the toast with Thai milk tea dip! The portion of the toast looks bigger than what is shown on the menu.
4
Authentic food, great portions. Roasted pork with Kailan is excellent. The usual affair around green/red curry/Tom Yum (free soup refills)/Pad Thai are all fantastic.
It is a little pricey for one to consider eating that on a regular basis.
3
Food is good in general and especially the Padthai. Highly recommended the Thai milk tea. It's a pricey place and we feel like paying a hotel bill but what we had was a casual environment and food setting.
2
The average price of a dish is around $18, which for a plate of phad Thai or the rice dishes, is extremely overpriced. This also raises the expectations and sadly, falls short. The dishes are actually basic Thai food. The Thai milk tea is also not as good as other Thai restaurants. Understand that this is in the CBD area where rent is expensive, but people should really try somewhere for a good value for their bucks.
5
Another visit for Cha Thai restaurant the standard never this become a must to eat and a must to visit in Singapore trip It's full of quality serving in your bowl mist try the baked giant prawn clay pot and all the curry good location just right in front of mrt
5
We ate here mainly because it was right next door to our hotel (AMOY) and I was tired and did not want to walk too far. What a lucky thing to do. The service was quick, pleasant and effective. The menu reasonably priced and extensive. The food ordered was delivered quickly and my pad Thai was full of flavour, enormous prawns and very filling. The only negative I would have is that the table was being cleared while I was still eating! Patience needed
3
We ordered a clear tom yum soup and a minced pork dish with 2 plates of brown rice. Food is fresh and serving is slightly bigger than average but the you can definitely get the same or better food at half the price elsewhere. The ambience is decent and maybe it's the location that commands the price. Total spent was $60 including a bottle of mineral water. Would not recommend unless you want to eat in a nice environment and have lots of money to spend.

It is already my 5th visits and whenever I think of Thai Food in Singapore, I will definitely think of ChaThai. Casual, not pretentious, authentic Thai is what you get here. Yeah, price is on the higher price but they don't compromise on the quality. I got their loyalty card and shops runs different promotion from time to time.Of all the dishes I tried, none are disappointing. Clear Tom Yum Goong, prawn cake, fish cake, braised trotter, pineapple fried rice, noodle soup.. all are great! Highly recommended and hope there are more similar restaurants in Singapore though
4
I was there to try out their Tom Yum Soup as it was advertise in Business Time that they make it from the scratch. Especially with its price tag ($28 a bowl) I must know what so special about it.I tried the Tom Yum soup, is nice, not too spicy and come with fresh prawn. But still a bit pricey for me to pay that at $28.However I found their Thai milk tea is super nice! They do offer take away at a counter outside. The tea is rich and milky enough. Not too sweet like most Thai milk tea. It really suits my taste.Highly recommend it if you pass by the restaurant and buy one cup for yourself. Take away drink cost $3.50 - $3.90, however if you dine in, is $2,90++

Went here for a team lunch -- tasty food, good portions. We all left full and happy.Sometimes tough to get the attention of waitstaff, but service was fine. I'm sure we will be back.
5
Very satisfy and every one lover this restaurant as the taste and quality is very good it's hard to find original n nice thai food in Singapore as for many time i hunt for good thai food
5
Prawn cake is a must try dish (strongly recommended). Was very impressed with the seize of prawns that they used.
Big portion & value for money😀
4
I had their famous toasts which they accompany with a choice of butter (spreads). toasts also were baked / steamed. i accompanied them with a hot thai milk tea.
turn on: taste, courteous staff, value for money
turn off: language barrier
5
The Kurobuta pork is soft and tender grilled to crispy at outside. As I am not huge meat eater, I still love this a lot. The Pineapple rice, Thai Fruit Salad and Tom Yum Clear with Tiger prawns also taste good. Authentic and friendly staff
5
Centrally located on telok ayer Street. The portion of the food was generous, and the quality was good. Spacious layout, recommended for gatherings too.
5
The restaurant offers casual dining in a modern atmosphere. We have several times enjoyed lunch and dinner here with friends and family.Food menu is extensive with variety of choices, the portion size is large, perfect to share for 2-3 peoples. We always love Tom Yum Goong, Pad Thai, Grilled Pork with Sticky Rice, Green curry and etc. Compliment to the Chef and kitchen team as the taste was so original and tasty (as if you are having the meal in Bangkok) and we enjoyed our time here without any need to mention we are Thai! There are also a famous Thai iced tea to go along with steamed fluffy toast and custard! Definitely will come back when we are back in Singapore!
4
Good thai food, abit pricy but quality and tasty meal. We ordered dishes to share among the 2 of us. They aid have interesting drinks. But what I like most about the restaurant is the interesting bottles that they use for condiments. It reminds me of a science experiment.
5
Believe it or not. Giant tiger prawns and mussels served in tom yum and Pad Thai. The steam seabass is out of the world. Very fresh seafood indeed. Price is reasonable for the quality. Sides can go with kurobuta pork, thai fruit salad and crispy prawn cakes. Will be back agai
3
We had a pad thai at 22 dollars, one omelette with pork 18 dollars, and noudles 20 boxes...the food is good and service is nice as the restaurant just opened.We went for lunch , and we found the menu pricy for what it is. The lunch set is not interesting as 25 boxes...You won t be desapointed by coming there but the value for money is not good enoug
