Limited seats but not too long waiting. Food was fast and timely. Range of price from 10 to 13 for set meal. 8 flavours of seasoning to choose from. Overall not too bad.

Cooked to order so not fast food, but worth the wait.
We had the combo meal - variety of flavours and fries with a drink. Yum.

The wings are wonderful. The wait time is not that great, but it's worth the wait. They have a number of wonderful flavors. The ones I love the most are Mango & Habanero, Cajun, Lemon Pepper and Original !!

We ordered the 15pcs chicken combo meal. Chicken were not hot, dry and fries were soggy. Waiting time was around 20mins. Wings and drumlets were small. Louisiana is my Favourite among BBQ n Paraman cheese Flavours.
Novelty meal to try at least once.

Thought this restaurant will remid me of Chicken wings of Buffalo ,US .A bit disappointed in the dish.Opted for take away of 4 varieties from their list but it was too oily and the atomic variety was very hot ( spice -chilly laced !),there was nothing exceptional about the others,boneless , normal and breaded variety

It came out of US originally and a few shops have sprung up in a relatively short time. Have to admit the wings are delicious, putting the price tag aside. The variety of Flavours is also impressive. I just wish the size of the wings could be slightly bigger and meatier

My family and I ate at Wingstop in Vivo City. Waiting time was about 20 minutes. We ordered 2 meals with one chicken had hickory and the other teriyaki. There was no difference in taste and the chicken tasted like wet fried chicken.The worse part of it was the rice was somewhat undercooked!Never again wingstop

The food is not bad but the wait is just unacceptable. The ordering staff did pre-empt us that the food will arrive in 20-25mins but ours took 35mins to arrive when people who placed order later than us had already got their food before their 20-25mins. I had to go to the counter thrice to 'remind' them that my order had not been delivered.

I am a chicken tender fancier and these were good. Come in a variety of styles and sauces. Menu is complicated and lengthy initially to order from. This time seemed easier.
4
A little bit confusing to order on first visit, but staff were relatively patient and helped out. Food was outstanding, but the seating is a little crowded and difficulties in getting a seat after ordering marred a perfect score

Visit the one at city square. Tried Louisiana Rub, Soy Pepper and Hawaiian flavor. Out of these 3 flavors, i prefer more to soy pepper and Louisiana Rub.
Reasonable price. Would go back again.

Despite the high prices and additional charges for e.g. additional 30cents for Ice Lemon Tea, the food's good and worth it! Love the different flavours available. Have tried the boneless chicken meal and also the wing burger. Food is also halal certified!Service by the staffs was also good. Was told by the cashier regarding the flavor , Original Hot (a bit sour therefore might not suit certain people's tastes.)Have to wait awhile for the food to be ready. Well this ensures that the food is freshly cooked. Would love to recommend the garlic parmesan. Absolutely delicious and well seasoned. Will certainly come back again to try more of the other flavours!

I went to the City Square outlet. Was greeted by a cheerful cashier. Spacious atmosphere.So I tried two boneless wings (Louisiana rub and super-spicey Atomic). I love the Louisiana rub. I liked the flavor selections but I wished the atomic should be a little bit more fiery. Too pricey in my opinion given the portion
4
Visited the outlet at City Square more with my family. First round, ordered 3 different flavors of wings, and was disappointed. The wings was very dry. After that we ordered for our second round, 2 different flavors of boneless wings, and my, they were out of this world. What a difference. The wings are well cooked and juicy.Would recommend the Louisiana rub over others flavor

Visited in January 23,2015 at City Square Mall outlet (couldn't find those outlet here). The place were super busy. I had to clean up table and put the old customers food tray away by myself. We ordered Original Hot and Louisiana rub.. Both were Good.. When we craving for wings, we will be back there again.

For chicken wing, this place is over price but the taste you can't resist lolTryBoneless chicken wingIf you like eat bone, try normal chicken wing Lousiana Rub and pepper lemon is the best so far for meLousiana rub is very rich flavor Pepper lemon is playful. Sometimes sour, salty etc. Their sauce is nice. Match with chicken wingJalapeno fries Ok only and I have indigestion after take french fries which bought on 27 Jan from city square branch

I heard from my family that it was good when she tried so I decided to give it a try. My first bite on the fries was delicious. Then I tried their Parmesan garlic, it was delicious too. The Louisiana flavor was okay only and unfortunately the Cajun was too sour and salty. In general, if you are not a fan of salty food, this may not be suitable for you. All their food have extra salty taste. I'm a fan of salty food but to me, this is a bit too salty
