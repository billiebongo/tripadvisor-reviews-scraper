Ordered the red ramen and it wasnt that spicy. But soup has so much flavour! I like my noodles hard so they did it just to my liking! Small restaurant but the food came pretty quickly

The service was fast and friendly. My Ramon was very flavorful... my noodles were just perfect, not too hard and not soggy.

Had a superb meal at Ramen Nagi. Really loved the texture of the noodles, The richness of the broth and the cosy atmosphere. The taste of the black king ramen was also surprisingly delicious and interesting, never tasted such ramen before. Highly recommend this place.

Visited this place on a tuesday. Was surprised to be able to get seats almost immediately at dinner time. Had the 'Black King' which gave a really sweet garlic taste to the broth. Great balance indeed.Pros- Lovely atmostphere- Great tasting ramen- Different flavours of Ramen you can choose from- Decent prices- Friendly service- Customizable to your taste (Hardness of noodles, spiciness, richness of broth)- Offered Kirin goes fantastic with the Ramen- Pork belly is beautifully done. - Noodles are perfectily done to your liking- Broth is extremely rich and flavorful Cons- Would prefer the ramen to be served warmer- Service is friendly but slow at times- Refill of condiments should be faster and more automatic- Could give eggs as a standardAll in all, great experience, good bowl of noodles. Enjoyed myself there. You wouldnt go wrong with Ramen Nagi

Hailing from Fukuoka, Japan, Ramen Nagi is no stranger to ramen fans. One of its more unique ramen flavours, the Green King - a clever mix of basil and parmesan cheese - did not disappoint. The broth was rich and creamy and the noodles were cooked to perfection. I like how almost the entire bowl is customizable - from the firmness of the noodle to the saltiness and spiciness of the broth, to even the cut of pork (shoulder or belly). Ramen Nagi is definitely a must-go to get your ramen fix

Before i begin, let me put a disclaimer here: I am not a big fan of ramen, and I would not make a deliberate choice to dine at a ramen restaurant. With that being said, it probably makes you think that this review is going to be nothing but a full list of criticisms. I am so excited to announce that I will never see ramen the same way i did after having a bowl of goodness at Ramen Nagi. I have never really enjoyed eating ramen because it is, to me, a bowl of noodles with soup that contains no special spices or flavours to excite the taste buds, and i would much rather be having instant noodles for the price im paying for ramen. However, Ramen Nagi finally proved me wrong. I was served with a bowl of taut noodles in steaming rich broth and the first mouthful of noodles i took completely blew my mind away. I ordered the Red King bowl and i must say that the spicy red broth is truly out of this world. They have elevated an ordinary bowl of ramen to the next level through its tasteful refinements and flavour pairings. And before i even realise it, i have already devoured the entire bowl of goodness, leaving me with a satisfied tummy. The noodles are also perfectly cooked, neither too soft nor too hard. However, if you like your noodles softer or harder, you can always customise your order to have it the way you want it. Lastly, the pork belly is what i would return to Ramen Nagi for. I was generously served with a thick and succulent slice of pork belly. It was juicy and tender, and most importantly, easy to chew and swallow. Wait no more and hurry down to give it a try, because Ramen Nagi never disappoints

ramen is more of the heavier (oily, more flavourful) side, nothing impressive, nothing bad. pretty average. visited for lunch, and their gyoza weren't ready yet (why?!). service was extremely, extremely slow. this has to be my longest wait for a bowl of ramen, ever. what surprised me was that their serving size feels significantly smaller than other ramen places. this is the very first time i didn't feel any fullness after polishing off 1 bowl of ramen and i even had a doughnut immediately after

Noodles had a really good texture, I heard they make the noodles in-house. Ordered the Red King, was not as spicy as I thought, so I'd recommend ordering that with higher level of spicyness (a few levels to choose from). Check extreme on all boxes so that its super flavourful :

Both my friend and i are Ramen Lovers, and this is definitely one of the most authentic Ramen you can find in Singapore. tip for you is to opt for more spring onions. They use Japanese spring onions, it is SUPER refreshing minus off the spicy taste that local spring onion usually gives you

Awesome Ramen joint for those who enjoy ramen like I do! Décor was pleasant and area was clean. Service was attentive and quick, very typical of Japanese restaurants. Staff were knowledgeable and were kind to give us recommendations when we were ordering in order to ensure the ramen was suitable and we knew what we were ordering. I ordered the “Butao Ramen” ($13.90) which had a thick broth with a very deep taste profile. I selected the amount of chilli being “level one” which was just the right amount for me. For someone with an above average tolerance for spice, level two may be for you. (Levels go up to ten!). They were generous with ingredients, giving large amounts of green onions, black fungus accompanied with thick slices of Cha Shu. Added $2 for an egg, and would recommend an egg lover like me to definitely try it. I also ordered Mujicha at $1, which at its price I would expect to taste bland, however it was definitely not the case. To top it off, it is refillable! Great for someone who needs a drink to accompany their meal.Overall, the experience was definitely a pleasant one and I would recommend Ramen lovers like me to definitely give this a try, and this may be your new favourite joint
