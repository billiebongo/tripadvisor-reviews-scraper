Good place to pop by if you are around the area. Prices are much cheaper than the other cafes around the area. Decent food, nice decor, and interesting boss if you manage to talk to him :)

View of private jet landing, decently priced food, nice place to chill out, a good break for bikers at Seletar and lunchtime crowd of aero engineering employees. Friendly staff. What more can you ask for?

The ambience is nice, food pricing is restaurant price. Nice view of airport and if you lucky nice sun set view. Best time to visit will be before sun set dinner time.

Good view of the airport, and the food was decent. I like some of the drinks served there, not so common (sodas)

The cafe is located in a very quiet corner and wouldn't be able to see from the carpark. Food and drinks are at very reasonable price. Not much variety on food. There is no serve charge. Free parking.

This is an interesting little Bicycle primates cafe. It is located on Seletar airport so there is also the opportunity to see the aircraft take off and land. The food has a more Japanese slant to it. I had the Katsu Curry and was pleased with the food

We went in the evening to chill out with friends and got the outside seats. Food is ok and avg portion. Draft beer is good when u seat on a humid evening. Saw private small plane land and took off 2 times very interesting. Can't get nearer to an airfield strip like this in Singapore.

Friendly, down to earth joint. No frills. Don't expect fancy bistro breakfast like eggs benedict. Their menu is more geared to lunch, with their chicken chop being similar to the western food at the kopitiam. They have nicely made cakes, some eggless so it is light and less dense. They have beer on tap, so perhaps it might be a nice place to enjoy a mug in the evening with some friends. It got rather rowdy around late morning when the families started pouring in. Would come by again, but probably in the early morning - and just for coffee and cakes.

mediocre food with very poor service. they do not have service charge, but we certainly didn't expect the service to be so far off from the beautiful interiors. staff saw us, we said hello but didn't receive a courtesy reply or even a smile. they were laughing at the counter non-stop, about 3 to 4 of them. there were no other customers around. pretty sums up the experience. P.S: not a big thing, door pasted WIFI available here. when asked, the staff simply brushed us off, saying no WIFI. Didn't continue to the conversation

I have frequented this cafe since it was first started and I once enjoyed the ambience and the food .. I visited the cafe again just today after a 6 mths hiatus and was initially shocked to see that it was completely empty.. we thought it was because of the competing cafes that have sprung up around the airbase recently.. however.. after my dinner.. I understood why business was so quiet.. first, the food was bad.. cold and mushy.. it was obviously pre cooked because it was served to us within 3 mins of our order. chicken was bloodied... beef rendang was super tough.. .. water was $0.50 per cup.. which is fine.. but guess what.. not refillable! $0.50 for every small cup of water.. service was not great and a lot of flies flying around.. certainly not the cafe I once knew it to be.. it's a shame.. because I thought they had something going for them..

It's a great experience to have lunch and coffee next to the runway! The food is good and cake is delicious. Our children had a wonderful time having lunch there while watching the jet landing. Great experience!

The family was here for an occasion and such great place with good food. The sambal steak was a delightful surprise. The beef rendang was god send. Very nice surrounding and wonderful service. Strongly recommend

Nice place with outdoor seating and a great view of the airport. Food is typical of a cafe with an additional area for indoor dining.
5
I had beef rendang which was very tasty and very reasonable priced.
Owner is a bike enthusiast and the decor is bikes and bike themed.
Also good view of the airport which has lots of parked private jets. How the other half live :)

It's rare to find a "real" cafe in Singapore. Too often it's pretend pretend with no soul. Here's a cafe done by a bike fan serving decent food at modest price. It's instagrammable without being fake.

The cafe is separated into 3 sections;- The outdoor seating beside the airplane runway- 2 indoor areas (Aircon and Non-aircon seating) We chose the outdoor seating area, quite a nice spot to just chill and relax with your friends (IF the weather is good.... the sun was glaring during our time there and i was sun burnt...) Cafe was under-staffed, waited quite a fair bit to have our orders taken. So we ended up approaching the staff for order-taking rather than they coming to our table.We had to get our own utensils and condiments as well, to the point where the other diners thought I was the waitress working there and approached me for orders. *Then again, there is no GST and service charge, so we're cool with that*The food was a disappointment. We ordered:- Ribeye steak- Mega beef burger- Katsu Curry- Cheese fries- MochaAll of which tasted like the ones you could have easily ordered from the western stall in your nearby coffee shop. The coffee is not particularly rich in taste or aromatic as well. The cafe only offers ice cream sandwich (Something like a macaroon), which prolly goes well with kids. We gave it a miss. All in all, a good experience to have brunch by the runway. Food wise, I guess we only enjoyed our fresh coconut and beers after the coffee left us unsatisfied. Majority of the crowd are families bringing their kids to enjoy the view of airplane taking off.If you're around the area looking for a place to chill and drink, may wana drop by. Not sure if we'll drop by again since it's quite out of the way

Came to this nice restaurant tucked away at the north-eastern part of Singapore on a Saturday evening. We had 4 adults and 2 kids. Overall, it was a nice experience for an evening get together casual dinner. Restaurant - set beside the runway, kids can get to see planes taking off or parked there. And also the sun setting can be quite a view! There are three areas in this restaurant. Al fresco style, 100% aircon with windows for viewing and an aircon area with collapsable door drawn to the side (best view). I suggest anyone coming with big groups to do prior booking because the queue can be very long! You will get the stressful feeling of people queuing and looking at you eat. Food - food was not the yummylicious type but fair enough for a good gathering. The restaurant was not stingy with the cheese on the cheese fries. But the beef steak was a disappointment. It's the type of beef that you get from Hans; tough to cut and eat. The price for the mega burger is not as pricey as compared to some I had. But the taste and size definitely doesn't match up. The fried chicken winglet is the saviour for my meal...it has a good crisp and taste; like the one at ikea but smaller in size.Service - there were only two staffs running around. Very hectic and they tried to work with a smile. So don't expect awesome service because the serving staff to customers ratio is high. Don't blame the restaurant cos labour cost doesn't really come cheap these days.Price - average abt $40/pa

The food offered by the cafe is tasty, and the service was good. Plus, I really like the vibe of the cafe, especially in the aircon area with the beautiful displays of bicycles. However the menu choices are very limited. Also, during the time of my visit, I wasn't able to try their coffee as there was something wrong with their coffee machine. In addition, seating can be quite limited in the aircon and sheltered areas, so sometimes it is very warm to sit outside especially during the afternoon. In the future, I would definitely want to go back again and try other food from the menu

It is so wonderful to find a cafÃ© so near to a runway. We in the evening and sat outdoor to enjoy the breeze and the wind as the Seletar Airport is in open field. No complain for food and staff was helpful. It is a good cafe to visit

Recommended by friend for a dinner at this place. As we walk towards the restaurent, I am attracted by the nice scenery where we can see aeroplanes parking nearby. This place has really nice ambient. Quite a fair bit of families with young children were here and the children really enjoys running around. The food is quite nice here, friend ate the steaks and she said it's yummy. I personally like the hamburger ice cream. What I am disappointed is the service. The crews are not friendly, there are lots of room for improvement. We were not welcome by any crews, the whole restaurent was so messy, we got to approach few staff whom is not helpful at all before we can get a seat (normal practice in Singapore is "wait to be seated").And, we have to find the menu on our own and try to figure out how to order as nobody approach us. Hope to see improvement in service, Singapore is relying on service

Bad food. Bad service. Nice view of planes.
Staff are not able to cope with enquiries and slow to respond.
4
More than just a bicycle stop. Really nice cafe in the north east. Right next to the runway, u can see the planes coming and going.
5
A unique cafe located off the beaten track in seletar. Next to the Runway no less. Watch planes take off and land as you dine al fresco outdoors!

Sounds exciting, mainly catering for cycling enthusiasts and located right next to a runway. Bikes hanging on the wall. However, it was lacklusture, and food was average though selection was quite decent. Only redemption is the opportunity to dine near a runway where there is a possibility to see some planes landing or taking off. None happened while we were there though.Food was ok, nothing to fave about, with seating in either air-conditioned room or out in the open. Set in a quaint surrounding, suitable for large group or family outings. Good place to meet up with fellow cycling enthusiasts. Service is average

2nd visit to this place. The hub and I were kinda disappointed with the food this time. We had their - 1. Mega Beef Burger (it doesn't looks mega to us), it doesn't taste good as well.2. Spring Chicken (the chix i had is only 2pc of chix thigh, the meat is too dried and hard, had difficulty in chewing. It doesn't taste nice either)3. Calamansi - nice and coolin

Had the most interesting visit to this beautiful and unique bicycle cafe by the Seletar Aerodrome.The internal setting is tastefully done bicycle theme with air conditioned sitting or al fresco sitting to enjoy the activities of the Aerodrome.The food is very good with very very reasonable pricing. A mouth watering Ayam Panggang comes complete with rice and achar costs only $10.80. Truly value for money. Likewise the rendang. I am aiming to try their western on my next trip.They also serve fantastic coffee and one of the best flat white that I have tasted in years. Truly a unique setting with great food. A place to impressed your friends or loved ones. Certainly you will be seeing a lot more of me here

The cafe had nice displays in it, mainly bicycles. It also had a scenic view outside, and i stayed until after the sunset. We were able to see the runway and small planes taking off. It was a breathtaking scene and wish to go there again. However, food is quite expensive
2
Had to wait for a table and there was no proper system to queue for it. And even after getting a table still have to wait for more than 30mins to clear the table and we have to do it ourselves. Food was decent and not to pricey thou
4
Not a big selection on the menu but the key is it's of the urban trail located next to the airstrip where private jets come and go Singapore. Not a easy place to go by public transport. No private jet taking off the strip when I was there but the katsu don is not bad
1
Firstly, this place is very far off anyway and 80% of the parking lots are being reserved. When we entered with pham, staff just stood there looking at us struggling with the high steps. No menu were bought to us, Earl Grey Cheesecake no taste of cheese nor earl grey. Cheese Fries taste damn funny and soggy. Mocha was in a very bad shape, don't need to talk about the taste. One statement, first and last time that we will visit this and don't need to waste time visiting this place.
