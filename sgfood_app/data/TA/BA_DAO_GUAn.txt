The food was served hot and tasted great. The drinks were served cold and tasted great. Service was good and price was below expected. Particularly liked the crab meat fried rice, although it would have been better with a little pineapple mixed-in.

Good spot for people watching on busy road. Beer served was very cold and good value by Singapore standards. Also had veggie dumplings which served hot in a steam basket.

Our tour manager organised a meal here this evening for a group of 24. Food excellent, Tiger beer cheap. Only issue was the order that food appeared. We’d finished our lovely duck leg and scallops with vegs before noodles arrived.

We got there spontaneous on our first evening in Singapore - in the middle of a crowded street. Very nice food and craft beer. We stayed for a while just to watch the people in the street, was a lot of fun.

Just in the middle of Chinatown in a very crowded busy area you can find this bar with a lot of artesian beers
Really recommend... not a relax place since the confusion around but the beer is super

We ate here and found very poor service. One main came out but the other, a simple noodle dish, did not arrive. Had to ask twice before it eventually came. Food was only average. The chicken dish appeared to have lots of bone in it, and it was very poor cuts. Do not recommend

In the heart of Chinatown. Nice food and lots to do. But the attitude of serving staff is terrible. They juggle with tables and can be downright rude. Takes the charm away from the place. You need a few beers to ignore them and enjoy the Hainanese Chicken Rice which is terribly overpriced

We visited the corner seafood restaurant at Chinatown, Singapore for lunch of 4 person in Sept. The food fine although quite expensive but the staff there were very rude. We request for 4 chili, one for each person, but they only gave us 2 with very rude attitude. Not even they didn't gave us what we request (we really don't mind if they ask us to pay for that) but they also grumbling INFRONT OF US. Will never go back there even if for free

We planned a holiday to Hong Kong and decided to stop over for two nights in Singapore just to visit our favourite restaurant for my favourite meal Beef Horfun (it's fried kway teow with beef instead of seafood). It was as good as I remembered from several years ago... So good that I ate it for two dinners and one lunch!) Location is great - on a busy corner of Chinatown. Ideal for a meal, cold drink and some people watching.

Centrally located, you can't miss this restaurant as you come out of the Chinatown MRT (towards Smith Street).The Szechuan Prawns are to die for. They are the best prawns I've had in ages! The veggie noodles and Chinese greens are also great too.With most main meals between $10-$20, this place is also great value. Throw in some awesome people watching and quick service and you're onto a winner.We loved it so much we ate here twice

Very good Chinese / Asian restaurant in the middle of China town.
Very crowded but good food and cheap prices. Also beer is very cheap.
Have been there already several time and will come back...

Happened by this restaurant wandering through Chinatown. Ordered the Chili Crab with fried buns and Tiger Beer. Excellent meal and tasty. More expensive than McDonald's but worth the splurge.
5
If you are anywhere near Chinatown you must visit this restaurant. Don't be fooled by the decor or surroundings. Just try and taste the splendid food.
5
Casual, crowded open-air restaurant. Everything is freshly made and delicious, and very reasonably priced. The dumplings were among the best we've ever had. If you are in Chinatown, this is a great place to go.

Stumbled across this resturant during our last day in Singapore. There are so many eating places to choose from in Chinatown it's pot luck really. This place was fine - food is OK; a large bottle of Tiger beer for $6.95 (SG); and service that gives you the feeling that you're a bit of an inconvenience - I wouldn't rush back
4
after paying SGD 12.00 for a small Tiger Beer in an Irish Bar we came across this restaurant in China Town and was attracted by the the advert for a large Tiger beer for only SGD 6.95. we decided to also have some lunch which was Schezuan vegetable fried rice and Satay Chicken skewers. the beer is cheap and the food is very tasty and reasonably priced, service is basic but fast, don't expect any frills here. well worth a visit, we went back 2 more time
3
Whenever we go to Chinatown we stop at this restaurant for a meal but the standard of the food is sadly going down. The steamed garlic prawns were tasteless and insipid and the seafood fried rice also not as good as last time. They also now allow smoking at the tables on the left of the restaurant, which in Singapore is very surprising.We will not go back there but eat in the food street, just around the corner when we next visit Singapore

This happened to be the first restaurant that took our fancy wandering around Chinatown fairly late on a Sunday evening. The name over the door is “Chinese Seafood”.There was a very happy young woman inviting prospective customers in from the street and she did her job well. The place seemed to be staffed by women and the lady-boss was sitting at a table in the middle of it all making sure her business ran like clockwork. And it did. The service was pleasant and quicker than could be reasonably expected.We didn’t have seafood because we’d binged on that the night before. But Singapore’s famous Chilli Crab is on the menu and I bet it’s good and not as pricy as the place we had visited. Crocodile was also on the menu but we gave that a miss too.Anyway, we four experienced Chinese food consumers agreed that this was one of the best meals we had eaten. And all at a reasonable price.This is what we had. The spicy French beans were particularly good.Black Pepper BeefSzechuan Spicy ChickenPork DumplingsSpicy Fried BeansPrawn FrittersBoiled RiceTwo DessertsWater/Beer/CoffeeThe bill came to 139 Singapore Dollars including the usual 10% Service Charge and 7% GST.They had an interesting range of fruit drinks to start. I had a bright green apple concoction called Ginger Granny Smith. The coffee was good.Make a point of finding this restaurant. It's big and on a street corner

My business colleague and I ate here on our last night in Singapore. Great Service, very good food at a reasonable price. We shared four appetizers and 3 633ml beers for S$84. This would have been double the price by the Orchard Road hotels. Take a cab and go to Chinatown. Eat here in a fun setting and buy some trinkets to take home to the family. I will not wait until the last night to eat here the next time

My wife and I visited Chinatown earlier today and had lunch at their outlet on Pagoda Street. They specialise in Chinese seafood but also offer pork, duck and beef dishes, and prices are reasonable.Although they were really busy, we managed to find a table for ourselves. Chill Tiger Beer before ordering a seafood fried rice and a Sambal Stingray which was really good.Service was efficient
5
This is a really good restaurant in the middle of china town area.
Furniture looks cheap but it is a really good place and food.
Try it. You won't regret...
4
Located in China town, food is excellent and reasonably priced.
Service is good - if they don't come straight away give them a wave and they will be straight there.
Nice relaxing place to sit, relax, eat and have a beer.
5
Located on a busy corner- when you are seated you can watch the busy throngs of shoppers pass byGood service - with great food at a reasonable priceThe owner ensures the staff are attentive to the wants of the customers and manages a great establishment !!

if you like chinese food, go there. Close to the MAriamman Temple-its just behind it and close to the MRT station this restaurant is placed well in the corner opposite the Heritage centre and well frequented. It also has a wide variety of choices. You must be a sea food lover . Their fish, prawns and crabs are good. The rice well done and the soups quite a starter to have. They also have wines and other alcoholic beverages I recommend the Tiger beer. The hosts are great and advise the choices well. The food is very fresh and tasty. Would love a little more sauces though. The moodles, cant complain!. Nearby eat street is just as good but you have to brave the sun. TIP: Dont count the calorie

Singapore is renowned for its chilli crab, so it was on my must-do list. Once again, was not disappointed!This restaurant is located on a vibrant street in China Town, packed with delicious-smelling restaurants. We were seated straight away, service was stellar and the food, well...Of course, we had the chilli crab which was spicy and flavourful. We ordered a veritable buffet between the two of us -- we couldn't finish it all (warning: food coma) but we wanted to try some different dishes.In addition to the chilli crab, try the black pepper beef -- it melts in your mouth.
4
Ate here on our first night in Singapore. Left a lot to be lived up to! Food was fresh, hot and tasty, at a very good price (approx S$70 for main course and a couple of beers each). It's not a restaurant style, more street cafe, but good busy atmosphere and a place to people watch.
4
What a great experience!!From the wonderful invitation to eat at this restaurant by the staff at the front as we walked by to the great food flavours it was very enjoyable. We sampled many different dishes and had a few Tiger beers. The staff were very efficient and friendly. Would recommend anyone wandering through Chinatown to try this place. You hopefully will enjoy it as we di

I have eaten many times in this restaurant on my visits to Singapore, this time I was visiting with Japanese customers. The Ba Dao Guan did not let me down, my customers were amazed and loved the place, they rated the chilli crab and prawns as some of the best they have tasted. The ice cold bottles of Tiger Beer are just what you need in a place like this and helped to make a great evening. A must visit restaurant if you are in Singapore on holiday or a business trip
5
My wife and I ate here twice on our last trip to Singapore. The similarity between this place and Temple Street in Hong Kong is amazing. Food hot and plenty of it. Beer cold and plenty of. This is not the place to go if you want a quiet romantic dinner this is the place to go if you want a loud and frantic time where your food might arrive at different times from all different directions. Cost is very reasonable and if you can get a table at corner of the street on the edge looking out then you don't need any more entertainment for the rest of the night. A good plate of food and few good cold beers and people watch. PUUUURFEC

One of the best places to go for Asian Mudcrab and a cold beer.Well after a full day of shopping in Singapore there is nothing better than a good muddy and a beer. Have to say the Black Pepper one was the BEST mudcrab I have ever eaten. Now that's saying something as I have had many in lots of countries.Try Ba Dao Guan in Chinatown - well priced and great food !!
3
Serves us right for going to the first restaurant we saw when we came out of the MRT! - staff abrupt & allowed no variation from the menu - ok food but not really a stand out
4
The Ba Dao Guan menu has plenty of finger food options that fit very well with their cold beer. The atmosphere is quite simple and the street full of people is part of the scene.
5
Spending a couple of weeks a year in Singapore on business, I'm always looking for somewhere that serves good food, at good prices and in interesting locations. This place has it all, and nice staff! The corner plot in the heart of Chinatown lets you absorb the tourist buzz too! Great place, I will be back
5
We stopped into Ba Dao Guan after walking around in markets and sightseeing. Both the Tiger beer and food were terrific. TIP: Try the Vermicelli Singapore Style noodles. The taste is excellent. We also enjoyed Spicy Beef with Lemon Grass, which was also excellent. Second tip: Face OUT toward the market,and enjoy food, beverage, and fantastic people watching

We having been coming here since our 1st visit to Singapore in 2001 and watched it grow and improve.The food is fast; Asian styled and served with the normal amount of frenetic behaviour one expects in Chinatown. The beer is always cold and plentiful.Over various visits the restaurant has been impossible to get a seat at to walk in without a difficulty so be warned, spots are not always available BUT it is worth the wait.The staff are fantastic. They work exceptionally fast and hard and I defy anyone to clean a table as efficiently as their people.The food is great and varied. You can spend as much as you like (Singapore Chilli Crab) or as little as you like (Ikan Bilis) and either way you will be satisfied.Finally, the position is on the corner in the middle of the main tourist thoroughfare and great to just sit, have a Tiger beer and people watch. This place is an institution that every visitor should experience

This was the venue for my last night in Singapore after attending a family funeral. It was the perfect finish to what had been a stressful period. Located in the heart of a bustling and colourful Chinatown that is also popular with tourists and locals. Do not be put off by the plastic tables and chairs it it is the food that makes this place worthy of seeking out. Service in true Chinese Asian style is quick but at time quite surly... typical of the genre and do not expect over attentive service as the food at times is almost thrown at you as they get busy the tables fill up quickly and there is a pressure to vacate once you have eaten.Menu choice is pretty vast but there is a general feeling it is the seafood that draws the customer in as they specialise in crab and lobster dishes. Be careful you check prices first as this can make a meal expensive. The waitress though did make it clear to us how much a Kilo of cooked crab was likely to cost when ordering so no excuse to be surprised. However on closer inspection the practice of charging for a wet towel whether you use or not seems common place in this style of restaurant so watch out - it might be only 30 cents a towel but multiply over the course of an evening and it all becomes a hidden extra charge that is very profitable for the restaurant.We chose 9 different dishes between seven people and had plenty of food. The honeyed crispy baby squid with crispy noodles is something of local legend apparently and was great. Sweet and sour pork was good but not as lush as that we had a Fatty's earlier in the week. Black Pepper Sliced Beef was excellent as was steamed Garlic Prawns. Beef with Ginger and Spring Onion was lovely and succulent and the fresh mushrooms and mixed vegetables went perfectly with the fried rice. The Black Pepper Crab at sixty dollars seemed expensive but the spicy flavour was awesome and whilst a bit of a marathon to extract from the shell was well worth it. Sichaun Spicy Chicken Fillet was as stated spicy with a real kick and generous chilli garnish. Good crispy batter on succulent chicken. Total bill was $214 without service charge and GST ($252 total about Â£121 for 7 people including beers)Would definitely go back and lots on the menu to excite and interest you

I found this restaurant in pagoda street in Chinatown.the food was good,dishes that were new to me,and quickly served.I gave then my card to pay was asked to go to the bar and fell over the forbidden by my table.I have a painful foot.so watch out for this hidden danger.ok
5
We ate here twice and had fantastic meals on both occasions. Ok; in terms of scenery and setting, the location isn't brilliant and yes it does have plastic tables and chairs, but, the food is brilliant, tasty and the cost is by far the best value for money we found in Singapore.Come here

Recommended by our nephew and turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Don't be put off by the plastic tables and chairs. The food (steamed whole fish, sliced roast duck and vegetable fried rice) was delicious and reasonably priced for Singapore. Cold Tiger beer was perfect for the food and atmosphere. Service was fast and efficient. It is a great place to people watch and it was bustling with the Year of the Horse approaching. Very colorful at night with all the horses lit up

I and my wife seated around 6:45pm. Took our order at 7pm. We Ordered crispy prawn rolls, chilli crab, seafood fried rice and 2 drinks. Our drinks came within 10mins. Served us spring rolls instead of crispy prawn rolls. At 7:45 they serve the chilli crab. We've been waiting and keep on asking them on our fried rice they keep on saying ok. Our chilli crab its already been cold chilli crab! Its already been 9pm and they havent serve our rice. WeDecided to cancel our order and pay for the side dish and drinks. By the way our drinks dont have taste already. The waitress told us that we cannot cancel the crab because it cost $48 and its already cold. and they can only cancel the rice. Thats the point they want us to eat the cold chilli crab without the rice! They still arguing that they cannot cancel. And when they heard us that we're going toCall the police they change they mind. I would not recommend this place especially for tourist. You will just wait your time and money on this restaurant!!
