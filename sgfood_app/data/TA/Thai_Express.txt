Since not going to Thailand for a while, decided to try this Thai fast service good joint. Food was standard Thai style. No shocks or surprise. Need to change or add items in the menu sometimes. But which fast food joint do that often?

Thai express has various outlets in Singapore and I for some reason have found their Thai food if not very authentic, close to it and delicious. The food is fresh and has Thai flavors and is good value for money. If you want to enjoy good Thai food without going to Thailand, this restaurant has it all, with friendly and chatty staff, they will recommend the dishes best suited to your taste and palate. I do return to Thai express everytime I visit Singapore

Thai Express is one of my most favorite restaurants for the best Thai food. My family loves the food there and when ever we get a chance we go there. SInce we are a frequent traveler to Singapore we feel very privileged to go and spend time there for lunch or dinner every time. It's an amazing food joint. There are many Thai Express outlets in Singapore. The ambiance of this place is excellent and the people serving food are also very well behaved. Thai Green Chicken Curry happens to be my most favorite dish, and I get the best in this place. Much better than any 5-star places too. There is a huge variety of widespread dishes in their menu. The variety of desserts is also lovely.I must recommend most travelers to visit Thai Express if they are looking for the best in Thai Cuisine
