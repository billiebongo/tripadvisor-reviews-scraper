Was on my way to IMM and found this hidden gem. It is a small takeaway cafe place. The staffs were very friendly and helpful. Love their Salted Caramel Latte! DA BEST! Highly recommend their cakes as well!

It’s located within a hospital along a stretch of shop which conceal this good coffee among other eateries. Tried their cappuccino and taste great. Silky foam on top with good mix of milk and coffee that makes the entire cup of coffee great. The only downside is that there’s no place to actually enjoy the coffee and pastry there, unless there’s vacancy at the long bench in front of the shop. Will definitely be back to try their pastry and to have another cup of good coffee.

I went to a hospital to drink coffee Ng Teng Fong hospital - yes, the fancy hospital that looks like a condominium from the outside.Was surprised to find their shop space is not like your typical café where you can sit down & have a cuppa. If you really want to sit, there's the common area right outside the shop - there are, like, 5 benches to sit at (+2 standing tables). Not a lot of space alright, so that's depending on availability.I like how there are inspirational/motivational quotes on the cup covers. These can come off as pretentious, but the friendliness & warmth of the nice lady taking my order made it seem more genuine & it also happens to be a timely reminder to myself at this point in my life.Coffee-wise: Smallest cup ("standard")= single shot, medium cup ("regular") = double shot. In the picture you'll see my Standard Latte ($4.90) & Regular Cappuccino ($5.60). They didn't have the boldness & strength of the coffee that I am used to, but t'was still a pleasant cup of coffee at a reasonable price. Also their cakes look quite amazing & they have cake sets (a slice of cake + latte/cappuccino from $8.50 onwards) which I would very much like to try the next time. Cash only Air-conditioned seats - if you get luck
