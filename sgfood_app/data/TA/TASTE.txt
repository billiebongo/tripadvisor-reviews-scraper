Some great menu items, too many good choices for a quick decision. Service was friendly, fast and efficient. The food was fresh generous and super tasty. Relaxed and quiet atmosphere. Will dine here again without hesitation.

We have stayed at this Ibis Hotel on several occasions. This time we had an evening meal in the Taste Restaurant on one evening. One of us had the sweet & sour fish, the other the sweet & sour chicken. They were tasty meals. We both had the chocolate cake for dessert, which was also good. The service was good. With my Accor Club discount it was a very reasonably priced meal. We will return to this hotel and this restaurant
4
Never boring eating at the Taste. Cosy ambience, clean, tasty food, friendly waiters. What else you need while traveling? Its the Tast

I stayed here at Ibis Bencoolen for 5 nights in October and dined in most nights. The food offerings were very good value and fresh cooked. So I had no need to look further afield to find a good meal.I can vouch for their quality and price of the food on offer at Taste Ibis on Bencoolen without reserve
4
The Taste is in the Ibis Hotel, is very nice comfortable and well set out.The food is very good quality but we were ther for the Singapore adventure as had street food that was better prices
5
An excellent spread of western and asian fare. Great coffee and great noodles and laksa freshly prepared while you wait
5
very tasty, just lots of newbies (could be students) as waitress but I guess with the lack of manpower in labour hungry singapore, no choice. they look a bit lost but with the ACCOR PLUS card, we got 50% off and so a dinner for 2 with 3 dishes we pay less than $25 and that's great value!!! cheaper than the what the uncle charge at coffee shop restaurant : ))
5
A cool place to stop in for a cocktail on a hot day. We enjoyed the satay and a Singapore Sling and glass of Pinot Grigio. The staff was nice and the atmosphere is modern chic.
5
Im an Accor member. Healthy food menu- simple and very nice e.g. club sandwiches and salads and other local dishes.
3
Sufficient food option for breakfast, but after the third day or so you will get bored with the same food.
3
The breakfast buffet was ok but not up to Novotel standard set by The Square in Nha Trang.. It had a narrow selection of local, Japanese, and Western selections. Very clean though and staff was extremely courteous.
5
I highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast or lunch.The breakfast buffet has an enormous choice of breakfast options .The buffet includes fruit, cereal. pastries and cooked food which includes curry.I had chicken for lunch. This restaurant introduces an interesting concept to the lunch menu..You choose the meat you would like, you choose how you want it to be cooked and the sauce you would like with it .It was definitely worth a visit,.I will be back again
3
Reasonable breakfast, convenient quick food. Some authentic Singapore tastes included. Part of the IBIS hotel. Friendly helpful staff
3
The food is good but the time taken for the food to be served was a bit slow. Probably because of the change from breakfast to lunch. The staff (May) was however friendly
5
Had breakfast and lunch at Taste... Could not possibly ask for more... Buffet was huge... from chinese, pastas, salads to Indian food... tastefully done interior and friendly and helpful staff..
5
Decided to utilize my Accor Plus voucher and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food, service and ambiance. Food was authentically local and I enjoyed the brunch. Value for money. Service was excellent. Special mention goes to Happy who takes delight in her work. Excellent product knowledge when I got her to recommend some dishes to me. She's the epitome of service excellence.I enjoyed the ambiance - casual and relaxed, especially the ceiling to ground windows. I'm certainly going back to make it my to go brunch venue. 
3
There are variety to choose from for breakfast but quite normal with nothing special - but different types of fruits on different day
2
We decided to try one of the western menu items, a cheeseburger - well it was ok, nothing to rave about - very low in taste, much cheaper to go to Burger King which is about a 3 minute walk from the hotel and much cheaper and much more filling
4
I always get breakfast here. The menu is variance and delicious. From nasi goreng, bread, salad, spagetti and you can eat all if you want. I think this is one of the best breakfast I have tried. The place also clean. Good.
4
This is a basic restaurant with no frills. The food is well prepared and tasty. Service is attentive.
For everyday meals at reasonable (though not cheap) prices it is very satisfactory.
5
Nice menu and quick service... The food was really good and we enjoyed the meal suggested by the staff.
5
We ate a few times in this restaurant, we liked the food for its taste and the variety of food served. And most important is the staff that are very helpful and polite
5
The satay and beef hor fun was fantastic! A bottle of white wine wasn't too expensive too. One could sit here until way past midnight, no problem as the staff will not ask you to leave. Food portion was huge and well worth.
5
as I was staying at the Ibis and could not be bothered finding a place for dinner decided to dine here, Had one of the dinner specials of soup, main and juice and enjoyed the meal very much. The soup i has was mushroom and was very tasty, the main was a prawn dish with rice and it was wonderful, and a pineapple juice included as well all for only $20 approx, the service and friendliness of the staff was excellent at all times and the deserve to be commended for the vibe they give the place, for a reasonably priced hotel meal it was a very good experience
4
I wasn't much for going out to eat during my stay at the Ibis, so I decided to just schlep downstairs and see what the restaurant in-house had to offer; I wasn't disappointed. I ordered some simple vegetable fried rice and a pint of cider to cool myself down after a long day of walking about town. The price was fair, the food was good, and the service was attentive and prompt. I'm sure there's far better cuisine to be had in Singapore, but for a late night dinner in the lobby of a budget hotel, you'd be hard-pressed to find anything better
4
We are here recently on a Sunday night. That atmosphere is very nice and it was cool inside. They have a selection of western and local dishes on the menu. The service was very prompt and friendly and the prices of the meal were excellent. We have found most food is very cheap compared to home.We had a variety of food which was allCooked well and we were served very quickly.Overall this is an excellent place to eat and would cater to everyone's food pallets
4
We stayed at the Ibis for 8 nights and had breakfast in the Taste restaurant every day, plus dinner on one evening.Breakfast had a good variety of food, Western and AsianDinner was better than we expected. A tasty meal at a reasonable price. We would have eaten there again, but there are so many other eating options to try in Singapore
4
Breakfast was very good with a wide range of tastes catered for with Chinese, Indian, Vegetarian and Western buffet areas which enabled us to concoct some unusual combinations each morning.Dinner was excellent and well priced. The Thai Green Curry was very flavoursome and they make a great Chendol for dessert.Well worth trying if you are staying at the Ibis, don't feel you need to go out to find something good to eat, it's right here
3
They served breakfast with mix American and Chinese Malay style. Not much choice but enough to reacharge body with food and drink.
4
This restaurant is part of the IBIS hotel. Suggest everyone to try the CHEF'S special - Mixed Fried Rice and its amazing. This is average priced restaurant and alcohol is served there
4
We ate here a few times, and we liked everything served to us. The chicken rice was quite delectable. I quite liked the tapas menu, with multiple options.
4
We came to have lunch at Lemon3 Thai Restaurant but it was closed for renovation & we decided to come to this restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised that the service was really good though most of the servers were trainees, they helpful & provided excellent service. The lunch menu was good but nothing to shout about. Serving size for the $17 sets - Indonesian & Chinese were small. It came with a drink and I chose iced chocolate which is $5 on the menu but they said iced chocolate isn't included with set meals. So I chose mango juice instead - it was canned mango juice. I wasn't totally surprised as I wasn't expecting fresh juice. There were tapas selections - 3 dishes for $17 eg. Chicken rice, Char Kway Teow, etc. They also have non-Asian food like Fish & Chips etc which is pretty good. The ambience is excellent. I liked the modern decor and the low sound levels were conducive for conversations.
4
This restaurant is attached to IBIS Hotel. The breakfast service starts from as early as 4am (a smaller selection of pastries, juices, cereals, coffee and tea). I had to dash out early during my stay and was glad to be able to grab a hot cup of coffee and some pastries before the long day ahead. The full breakfast buffet spread is also very extensive. Staff were attentive and replenishments are constantly done

We were staying at the Ibis where Taste is the hotel restaurant. Having had a long and tiring day travelling we really didn't feel like venturing out so decided to eat in the hotel. The concept of tapas style eating is one we love, since it gives us opportunity to try lots of different food so Taste sounded ideal.The restaurant is off the hotel lobby so not an intimate restaurant environment, but stylish nevertheless. I wish I'd made a note of the dishes we tried since there is no menu on the hotel website and we've done a lot of travelling since we ate there so the menu has slipped my memory. However, I do know that every dish was delicious, well-presented and served promptly by the excellent staff. The dishes were small enough not to overwhelm us but large enough to get a decent taste of each.Although I know we could probably have eaten cheaper at local restaurants outside the hotel we felt the prices were very reasonable and were pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and would definitely eat here again
4
We stopped in for a late bite and had a burger and fish and chips. We were told by the staff the food would be 15-20 minutes, and we have no problem waiting for fresh food so we were glad to wait. The burger was made of good meat, juicy and cooked very well. Fish and chips were tasty too. The ketchup is that weird paste-like stuff though, so be forewarned about that. The service was pretty good and the prices were reasonable ($12 SGD for each dish.) We were pleasantly surprised for a walk-by drop in. It looks dark from the outside, but don't let that make you weary, it's pretty good! Good location if you're near Bugis Street or in the Bencoolen area
4
The is restaurant is located in the foyer of the Ibis on Bencoolen Hotel. It doubles as the breakfast room and is open 24 hours. For a restaurant in a budget hotel, it provides a good restaurant and bar service. The environment is functional but is more than made up for by the attitude of the staff who are always ready with a smile and polite, helpful service
4
Nice atmosphere with very friendly staff. Very basic menu but enough variety for everyone. We had the special fried rice with prawns whic was very tasty, also the fish and chips were good. Great if you want to stay in the hotel and don't want to venture out

After a long day of shopping or activities in Singapore, all you want to do is relax in your hotel. Taste is the relaxed, very well priced restaurant for you.My partner and I had dinner and ordered the Satay Combination, Carbonara and shared the apple crumble. The meals were delicious, although the Satay came with only two small pieces of rice cakes (1 inch x 1 inch) so if your hungry, order another meal. The satay sauce was probably one of the best flavoured satays I've ever had.The drinks are pricey but this is everywhere in Singapore, so don't let this deter you. We will eat here again and would highly recommend Taste for groups, families and couples
1
Took 25 mins of no service before we decided to walk out. Look around for other restaurants or order as they take you to your table. Don't let them go or you may be waiting for a while.
5
A great experience and wonderful to taste local food, we shared the 4 dishes for $18, chicken rice, beef hor fun, roasted duck, veges all yummy, with a local beer and wine, then deserts. Service was excellent and helpful, total cost with taxes was $47.
4
Great way to try the local food as it's name suggest it's food you can have in small portion to sample 3/4 or 5 dishes all mouth watering and delish.
3
The restaurant is open all throughout the day. The food is a good mix of asian and western food. The place is good for eating at odd times otherwise there are cheaper restaurants in walking distance. The carrot cake was good. I ordered a local desert made of coconut ice which was unique though difficult to finish
3
the food was ok, you can find much cheaper and tastier meals around the corner in the bugis shopping area. I had the satay, which I cannot recommend. After eating delicious satay in Malaysia theirs just did not make the grade. also had the Hokkien Mee, which was tasty
4
The menu never seems to change but was wide enough that I was able to eat a great many meals in Taste. For comfort food the burger and fries cant be beaten. The Asian Taste menu was exotic enough for me to feel I was trying something new but done in a way that I never felt challenged as I sometimes did when eating out (e.g. quality of meat was high)
4
for those looking for a quiet, airconditioned and yet decent place to eat, this is the place to go. been here twice and order the 3 dishes sampler which is quite worth it. there is hokken mee, carrot cake, char kueh teow, chilli crab, pork ribs, etc.. to choose from. worth it
3
This is located in Ibis Hotel across summerview hotel.Food is adequately good. Value for money is average.Ambiance of the place is very nice.Service was a bit slow.Over all, had a good meal but a bit pricey.Again has high rates from non-asian
4
We sampled the tapas menu which was very good with good size portions at a reasonable price. The service was quick and efficient. The only down side is that as it's in the hotel lobby it has quite a clinical feel like you could be in any hotel in the world rather than in Singapore. I would eat here again.

I was pleasantly surprised dining in this restaurant. Taste is the only F&B outlet found in Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen and is located on the ground floor next to the guest lifts. When we arrived at the restaurant, we noticed that the team members were busy (all three of them), so we walked in. As we caught sight of one of the servers, we signalled to her that we were planning on having dinner. She showed us to a corner table and introduced us to the menu. There was an ala carte menu and a tapas-style menu with local dishes in small portions. A combination of three small dishes sets you back approximately $15. Not halal, the dishes range from chicken rice to nasi lemak, carrot cake to mee siam. The most fussy diner would surely be able to find something for himself or herself as the tapas-style menu is quite extensive. The restaurant is spaciously laid out with booth seats and individual tables. Whitewashed walls made the restaurant look larger than it is.One team member stood out. Her name is Reylyn and though clearly there was a shortage of staff, she still maintained her smile and positive attitude. She was cheerful and made light of the present situation, definitely a team member worth holding on to.
