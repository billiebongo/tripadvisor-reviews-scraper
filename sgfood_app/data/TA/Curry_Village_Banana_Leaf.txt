Prices increased sharply since they had a minor renovation some time ago. While still popular (no empty seats at lunch), the prata has become thinner, the coffee much sweeter and the biryani somewhat less tasty than I remember it.
Try thre neighbouring shop to compare.

We stumbled on this place while wandering around and loved the Roti Prata, as well as other dishes recommended to us. And they were so nice as well! Would definitely go back and try more things.

This outlet is 24 hrs... But very busy during office hours and days due to its location.Therefore it's planned accordingly... Simple with no frills.... So don't expect much other than good food.Have ample seating including outside... But still gets busy during peak hours.... Which says it all about their food...Yes service is very good too.Visit this place couple of times in a week for my lunch... And enjoy it every time.Veg and non veg... Equally good..

We found spot to eat food and then ordered our chicken and lamb curry and rice. They have been served on big plate covered by banana leave. Curries have been nice. They also have beer. Setting is very basic, plastic stools around outside tables. There is no price so you have to ask for it

I eat here almost two to three times a week. A little expensive when you order rice chicken mutton sets otherwise worth it and taste like home food. This shop is 3 times better then any race course expensive dining restaurants. Not for bringing business partners or celebration, its located along the dusty road but you can sit inside comfortable and clean. Overall FAST AND FURIOUS SERVICE !!

Generous serving of Dum briyani at affordable price. Be prepared to wait as their queue system is a little messy during lunch hour. Hidden in a small alley, this stretch of eatery offer yummy treats that can be very addictive.Enjoy the yoghurt with cucumber and onions as well as chicken tikka.The Rice is well cooked with rich flavor.Don't forget to get the papadum

The Prata was just slightly warm, hard and dry and undercooked. The egg thosai was tasteless. I bought a takeaway and the dhal curry was so watery and cold. The mutton curry had too much of a lamb smell and it was cold as well. Do not recommend this restaurant at all and this was not even my first visit. I thought I'll give it another chance and it ruined my breakfast this morning
