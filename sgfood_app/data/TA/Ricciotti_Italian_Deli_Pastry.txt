We had two course lunch for 2 adults for ONLY 30 $, the food was delicious and presented in a beautiful way. The setting and the service at the restaurant were excellent.

So many excellent dishes but without the Singaporean 'service '.
Salami Picante pizza
Fettuccine ala bolognaise
Linguini Al grandiose
Cheaper, better quality and better service than the sterile RIVERWALK branch.
Refreshing.

Good Italian food coupled with great neighboring atmosphere makes this a nice wind-down venue. The quality of food is top notch and the service was SUPERB. Every individual that serviced us paid extra care...and was patient with our demands... Which was great considering the restaurant was full at the time.The meals all came super fast and was freshly made. The pizza was great (four cheese). The pasta too was spectacular, the seafood fettuccine is a must try. The chicken thighs (grilled) was another good dish. All in all this is a great discovery and I will definitely visit again upon my next visit to Singapore.

Ricciotti is a great little Italian that i use on a regular basis for business meals and they serve a great range of very tasty traditional Italian food which are great value in a friendly environment.The outlet in China Square is outdoors and in and as with the one on Riveside which is also worth a visit has the full range of Italian meals. You can have light salads, paninis and snacks or full steaks and pizzas or grilled chicken and salmon. Something for everyone with lots of vegetarian options too.Service is always efficient and friendly and all round its a great place for a convivial busines or catching up lunch
