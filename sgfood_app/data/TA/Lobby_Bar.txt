A pianist will entertain you in the evenings, but service is not great and food choice is limited. Expensive for a UK man at present.

Rooms are comfortable and generally all staff are friendly.It will be more convenient If you can extend the wifi facility to rooms.
I had a chance to have my lunch at the lobby bar/Coffee shop and the service of Ms.Princess Lazo is excellent.

This bar has professional friendly service with reasonably priced drinks and a great choice of food. A ;pianist plays nightly - great for unwinding after a hard day's work.

A Sunday afternoon frozen margarita is never a bad idea. Especially when it's 32C outside and the only place to stop for a drink between the Alliance FranÃ§aise and Newton Food Centre is the oasis that is Sheraton Towers Lobby Bar. Luckily for me, Princess was on duty today and she made me a spectacular frozen Lime Margarita - i'm not kidding, it was so delectable I would've stayed for 3 more if I hadn't had a film to catch. And I normally don't even like Tequila! So the next time I'm in the area in need of a frozen cocktail, I'll know where to go and just who to ask for

I tried one at Raffles, but the best Sling in Singapore, served with a smile and a fresh slice of orange came from Nina at the Towers open, modern and comfortable Lobby Bar. The trio including colleague Catherine and Queen of the LB, Mme. Susan Wong, made this Singapore Saturday a pleasant return to the Sheraton.Merci!A

I went there on a Sunday for the Japanese high tea with my girlfriend. It's a unique experience as most places serve English high tea set. So it's a first to try the Japanese high tea. The sashimi were fresh and delicious. The tamale and sushi were pretty good. (we love Japanese cuisine so it's quite a high standard). The soba were not too bad. The rest of the desserts were pretty good actually, just that a little too sweet for our liking, but still worth trying. Weekdays promotion for 1-for-1 is more worth it of course, but it's still quite good. We spent a good 2 hours there and it was quiet, just like most 5-star hotels. The tea is refillable (including the iced drinks), which is fantastic. She had the lychee iced tea which is really nice, not too sweet and had a good taste. I took the more standard japanese green tea which was delicious too.I want to recommend our service staff (her name was Princess) for her patience. She even called me to confirm my booking. Waiting time were minimal, and service was handled with a smile. 5-stars to her too.It's a relaxing place. So it's definitely worth trying if you're in the area.(Recommend to walk about 5 mins from Newton MRT station

Was at the lobby bar for High Tea with my wife. Relax environment, reasonably nice high tea set that comes in two options - Japanese or English set in 3-tiers tray.Most of all the staff by the name of Princess was pleasant and courteous which compliment the whole experience. She was attentive and make good suggestions to the small bites menu over and above the high tea set that we've ordered.Good Job Princess!

It finally great to see that they have done some upgrades to this great hotel! What makes it even more great is the lobby bar; always relaxing; piano in the background and more importantly are the staff: Phil who has worked her for ages, always nice to see him. The service is excellent; top 2 with Alva, Stephen, of course Phil and Princess. They all greet you with enthusiasm and happiness and there smiles are unforgettable! Outside of Phil's professionalism for his tenure, This new team is an upgrade from my past years! Thanks SPG Group for ensuring a great visit by the overall upgrades of the lobby bar!

Very good service from the waiter and waitress. Great value for money for the 1 for 1 high tea UOB promotion. Will be back again

Drinks are expensive in Singapore due to "sin tax" so don't expect a bargain. There is a nice outdoor seating area depending on the season if it is not to hot outside.

This is the best value restaurant in the hotel. There is a good range of food, service is pleasant. It's worth checking out the special deals for drinks. Food varies from European to local. There is sometimes some live music.

The lobby bar gives you a selection of tea, coffee and hard drinks. We had a darjeeling tea that was just right. Not brewed more to soak in the tannins that mar the taste of tea.

My friend and i decided to hang around the lobby bar just to relax and unwind after a 2-day training. Good decision...as one of your staff by the name of Princess Lazo was so accommodating and offered us yummy durian cake and a teapot of chamomile tea!Thanks Princess, we will surely come back to experience again your good service and hospitality

We always try to find our comfort before heading to our Big Task. Our first to Sheraton...the Lobby Bar doesn't disappoint us to the relax happy hour we are looking for. In every country we visit we always look and find d our own corner. Perfect welcome is well executed by Ms. Princess. Nothing beats a great smile to start our work week in SG. Well knowledgeable on the perfect Pair of Beer for the Happy Hour we are looking for. Thank you. Happy Guest here.

My partner and I are regulars at the Lobby Bar of Sheraton Towers Hotel at 39 Scotts Road, Singapore. Our most recent visit was on Friday evening, 21st Oct 2016. The quiet, warm and inviting ambience is just the perfect place for us to chill out. They offer a range of wines, beers, liquors, hot beverages and snacks too, all set up in a pleasant combination of sofas and plush chairs. The music is soft and soothing, allowing us to talk without having to shout, which is the case in most watering holes.If you happen to be there and get served by Ms Minju (a young and beautiful person from Korea) and her team, then it is a bonus. She makes a fabulous strawberry Margarita, complete with a full fresh juicy strawberry wedge. Though the evening became busy, she and her team never fail to maintain the highest levels of service with a smile. Whenever she catches a moment, Ms Minju will stop by for a small chat and this adds to the overall welcome.Even Mr Lali Kumar, who recognized us as regulars at The Dining Room came over to say hello. Lovely.If youâ€™re looking for a quiet and relaxing place to chat with friends or family while enjoying some drinks, check out: the Lobby Bar at Sheraton Towers, Singapore

The food was good and it was a comfortable/convenient place to share appetizers with coworkers. We tried five different appetizers and they were all good. I would only eat here if I was staying at the Sheraton. As you would expect from a downtown hotel the food was expensive.

Had a couple of drinks at the sheraton lobby bar. Despite it being located beside the dining room, the lobby bar is well demarcated within the first level of the hotel and provides a quiet ambience for one to relax and unwind after a long day.The service is good and the staff are attentive. Alcohol prices are competitive compared to hotels located within the city. Sheraton towers is also located 3 mins from newton mrt station and the lobby bar is very accessible either by train, bus or taxi. A great place to go to after work or during the weekends for drinks
