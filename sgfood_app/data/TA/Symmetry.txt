Place was cozy. Prices were abit steep and food portion were kind of small however food were great.service staff were excellent.
4
Nicely located near cafe area at Bugis. Tried the main dish and coffee which are quite good. Interior is pleasant.
4
I liked the atmosphere, service and food. Except maybe the location.
The hot chocolate was a bit too sweet for my liking though.
5
Great service and fast response of water refill. Nice decoration of the cafe. I like the avocado in Symmetry Brunch.
3
place is very dimly lit for dinner so we can't really see what we are eating. food was pretty good but think the brunch was more highly raved
5
The food and service was top notch.
The lamb dish was excellent and I really loved it.
I will definitely come back again.

Very very slow service. Not even that busy, many tables free. Mine and my husband's food came after 40 mins. 1.5h after we ordered we were still waiting for my hungry 5 year old's food. Asked multiple times about where the waffles were, to be told they take a long time. Even from scratch they should not take 50mins more than the other dishes and should not take 1.5h! Other people who came after us had their waffles served first. My daughter kept asking why they were getting theirs first, saying ‘maybe there are even more hungry than me’ :( (which I doubt!). The crab in the crab benedict had not been properly picked so had crunchy shell in it, and overall this was an odd wet dish. Nice tea and coffee (finished 30mins before any food came).No idea what went wrong, poor coordination and management in the kitchen combined with a lack of critical thinking from the (initially seemingly disinterested - in particular the girl with the dreadlocks) waiting staff?? Why would the kitchen cook and the waiting staff serve someone else, having to walk past a child almost crying with hunger, the exact dish the child is waiting for and ordered 40mins before those people??!!I said I did not want to pay for the waffles and they at least had the decency to take these off the bill. Do not come if hungry

Had the lovely octopus main with bits of chorizo in it. I have never had an octopus as good as that before. Truly remarkable. The foie gras was excellent too. The types of cocktails served were brilliant, I had the chatuchak which was a cocktail meant to taste like a royal Thai milk tea. The ambience was perfect for a Friday night out, definitely.

Restaurant is about 10 minutes walk away from Bugis station. It's located at the corner of a row of shophouse. We were there to celebrate my friend's birthday. All 3 of us ordered different things. We had pork cheek with pork belly. The pork cheek was melt-in-the-mouth tender! Extremely delightful but the mung beans served on the side wasn't too matching for the dish. The foie gras with duck breast was tasteful too. The foie gras was well pan fried though 1 piece wasn't quite enough for me. I ordered beef short ribs with mashed potato. The potato was served with a drop of truffle oil, when mixed together gives a delightful truffle aroma. The short ribs were very well done. Cooked to perfection, it was tender and juicy. Served with shredded radish and hazelnuts which I gave a miss because I'm not a fan of nuts. I found the truffle fries too pricey at $12 for just a small serving though I could barely stop eating once it was served because it was rightly crispy on the outside with mild truffle aroma. No smoking allowed inside the restaurant but the door was left open and the smell of cigarettes coming in from the alfresco diners was annoying for me as I was sitting near the door.
5
Loved the food a lot, I had the short ribs recommended by our server, and my partner had the duck and foie main. Was soooo good! Loved that they had 1 for 1 cocktails too, but found that they made the moscow mule cocktail a little too sweet for my liking, and my second cocktail, the Old Fashioned, a little too overpowered with the alcohol. However, loved the red Sangria! So many fruits in it, made it super flavourful and yummy. Overall a wonderful experience
4
Love the ambiance of the restaurant. Awesome food!! Staffs are friendly and attentive! Worth the visit!
5
Staffs were prompt and took the customers seriously when noticed their booking system was faulty the very morning I made my reservation. Follow-up with a call for confirmation on my booking. Excellent customer service!
3
Few choices for dinner and dessert. Brunch would be better. Service is alright but nothing special on the menu
5
Lovely brunch place with an extensive menu. Great team & very responsive to customers. Definitely a good brunch place for family & friends.
3
The food was average, price is expensive, music too loud. I ordered the symmetry breakfast. Mushroom and potatoes were not hot.
4
We visited Symmetry using a Chope voucher and enjoyed sharing plates and happy hour drinks amongst 4 guests.
Recommended food dishes include the beef cheek tailgate, roasted octopus and seafood stew.
Drink were at HH prices before 8pm.
2
Took almost 40 minutes for our food to be served - overpriced and portions are small. Taste was very average too - what a letdown for an xmas dinner. Only saving grace was the nice atmosphere.
3
Cousy interior and service was smooth. Only thing was that food was at maximum average - and if you compare to prizes...well, not worth it.
Will not visit again.
5
Great food! Fantastic service! We had the breakfast set, the duck confit and the beef stew. There were all delicious!
4
Great unpretentious little spot for caffeine refuelling, lunch and catchup! Food is above average, and in hearty portions- not exactly sharing plates but sufficient to steal a decent bite off someone elseâ€™s. Service, too, has been consistently good in the many times we have returned despite the crowd- so kudos to that.The place can get packed, as expected, so a reservation should help. Great for a solo coffee and book at the bar on weekdays
5
Always a good time here! But would love it more if there are photos to the dishes! If the price is a bit cheaper, I would come even more often! Must try place if you haven’t! Put it on your bucket list!
5
Food was pretty good, attentive services and overall it’s a nice place for group gathering. Will definitely visit again!
5
Delicious food and yummy cocktails. A quaint place. Ambiance has so much character. I will be going back to try their weekend brunch- a completely different menu.
4
Really good service and friendly all round! Food was awesome as well. Portions could be a little bigger but overall well served, well plated, and well enjoyed!
5
Food is great I love coming here!! Really my fav cafe I'd say but the food is pricey. However quality and service is great!!!
5
Symmetry is one of a good place for brunch. The food is so delicious and the service is great! Love the place and will go again
5
Arrived at the restaurant on time and was promptly served.. food was also great and nicely served. Will definitely go back again.
4
Had the Hokkaido scallop, chicken supreme and pork belly. My friend's first visit. He is a fussy eater but he loves the food served.
5
Went to this cafe with my boyfriend, was super amazed by its unique and captivating decors. Food was super tasty. I ordered Sunday roast and the steak was really well cooked and juicy. We also ordered eggs Benedict, the eggs are not too runny and tasted really compatible with the bacon. The mushroom garlic went really well with the eggs too. Will come here again
4
One of those cafes for brunch nothing much to shout about but it was good. Prices are a little above average as compared the others but hey, rent in the location at they're at is definitely not cheap so I understand.Coffees are good, though. Loved the acidity of the coffee (I drink mainly espressos and the occasional long blacks, only) Also, love that they have Guinness on tap!!!Service was alright; barista was friendly, door host was efficient.Wouldn't really go out of the way for this place but if someone recommends and have yet to been there before, I'd go again
4
Usually such a predictable dish, this place put a great twist on it with water bath eggs, mushrooms and bacon. Coffee took an age to arrive but was full of flavour. Nice atmosphere and great beats
3
The place is cozy, but music plays too loud. Dishes look very nice, but taste is average. The staff is very friendly, but they always keep an eye on you and plates, so sometimes that’s a bit uncomfortable 😅
2
We ordered the Spanish eggs. The eggs were unseasoned and tasteless, and the bowl was more like a soup...very very soggy and unenjoyable. When you pay $20+ for a meal you expect a level of quality.
5
Food was delicious and great ambience. Awesome eggs benedict and green tea latte 😋 Will definitely go back again for brunch :)
4
The food was really well prepared and marinated. However on the downside it can be rather costly. I will head down again maybe once I get a bonus.
5
Food was excellent, ambience was quirky and weird but food was brilliant.
The beef ribs are their best main.
5
Symmetry Brunch was AWESOME! Love the scrambled eggs and sausage the most! The Mocha was great! The truffle fries never disappoints!
2
The food was good but way too expensive for what you have in your plate and the music was very loud.
4
I have visited symmetry multiple times over the last few months and found the food to be consistently good!The have an extensive beverage menu (tea, coffee, cocktails) to go with the food. I typically take the symmetry brunch (the cheese chicken sausage and the scrambled eggs are quite good)The waffle with ice cream is also highly recommendedThe ambience is laid back and typically they play good musicService has been reasonably good except the off when they are a bit busy and food takes ~25-30 mins to serveDefinitely worth a visit esp. for a weekend brunch
5
Had dinner there with a group of friends and we enjoyed a nice sharing Chef's menu (which was very reasonably priced) and enjoyed the food. Some dishes were amazing but some were a little quirky â€“ but it's all for the experience. In the evening the restaurant's ambience was casual but really nice and cosy. Sound system was great and music was suitable for the mood. Great place for a cocktails or two, and interesting menu. Service was friendly but it was kind of slow and inattentive
5
came here on a date. it's a cosy little restaurant with great food and wine. always prefer smaller menu with really good selection. service is also top notch. can't wait to come back.
3
food portion too small for price. but i like the ambience.ordered benedict replaced bacon with salmon. not fantastic taste.
3
The Moscow mule is a little too sour.
Risotto was really average. felt that its a tad too pricey for such an average dish.
The truffle fries is still good though, fragrant and lightly seasoned with Parmesan cheese
5
I had the crab salad which was surprisingly decadent with poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and salmon roe, but not too rich and overpowering. The art and decor are fun and interesting too.
4
The food are excellent. We had Symmetry Big Breakfast and Symmetry waffles. The icecream on the waffles was a bit too sweet. Another than that, all were good. The staffs are friendly.
4
Crowded hot place hidden at CBD area. Menu list limited choice for brunch. Not full solely with a main course.
5
One of my all-time favorite cafes. We had the Wagyu Minute Steak & Eggs under the lunch menu and it was really delicious. You can't choose the rareness of the steak but it turned out tender and juicy, and well marinated. The Brussels sprout were amazing too - well caramelized and had that satisfyingly crispy texture. You can also customize your eggs cos I personally don't like runny yolk. Customer service was awesome too, the waiters provided plates for our birthday cake (even though it was outside food). Overall, it was a fantastic lunch! Will definitely come back again :
3
I love finding hidden little gems withing the city scape and side alleys, and this place is no exception. Very easy to miss from roadside appearance but once you enter you certainly feel the ambience and cafe culture that most coffee obsessed people desire. It was perfect. However you need more than ambience and i felt tge food just missed the mark. Nothing catastrophic but the eggs benedict just was not the standard of the hefty price tag i paid for. In saying that i believe there is potential without much additional work to raise it.The coffee was good. I enjoyed and being one of those obsessed coffee nerds i didnt have anything to complain about.Improve the breafast and fractionally lower the price...and i would happily give this place a 4 maybe even 5 stars
5
Not what you'd expect when you arrive out the front, with a bland exterior and sitting next to a backpackers. But inside is just sensational, an eclectic mix of decor that complements the delicious food. Had the Spanish eggs, cooked to perfection and melts in the mouth.Some complain that it's a touch pricey, but you get what you pay for. A
4
Shared the Seafood Alfredo and Beef short ribs, as well as the Tarte Tatin and an iced hazelnut latte. All dishes were very tasty. The seafood was especially fresh, and sharing was a good idea given that the pasta volume was sufficient, while beef short ribs was a little less (but flavour is still good. hmmm)
4
The chai tea latte was as good as I remembered (esp for those who enjoy a milky tea latte ;)) Food portions appeared a tad small but the beef short ribs I had were really tender. Thanks for a great meal!
4
loved the eggs ben. and the crispy fragrant waffles with apricot ice cream was no doubt one of the best of its kind. highly recommended for brunch. tends to get a bit crowded and stuffy on weekends though
3
The place was rather dark. Food was good although pricier. Would definitely go back to try their signature drinks.
3
Everything about this restaurant was decent; the waiting time, the service and the quality of the food. However we asked to leave the restaurant over an hour after the start of our reservation timing as they had another reservation waiting in line. I would not recommend visiting this place if you are looking to chill for hours with friends as they will ask you to leave when they get busy even if you've spent a significant amount of money.
4
Location The location was walking distance to Lavender MRT Station, at the hipster Haji Lane vicinity. The ambience was cozy and thoughtfully furnished. From the front , I could not see the entrance door until I got much closer to it. The door blended into the louvre window panes. There was a element of retro feel to the restaurant. Toilet The toilet was very clean. They used Aesop hand soap which was a big plus to me. It smelt so organic and luxurious. I was not able to turn on the tap until I went to locate a staff for help. The instruction was given but the text was ambiguous and unclear to me. Food The food was top notch. I ordered the Avocado on Toast with Bennie Eggs with a Piccolo. My friend ordered a Meatball Croissant which came with delicious Truffle Fries, and a Long Black. My avocado on toast with Bennie eggs was really good. The ingredients were generous and the Bennie eggs were on point. The piccolo was one of the better Coffee I had ever tasted . It was way better than the Piccolo I had at Dept of Coffee and Social Affairs at Soho London. The one at Symmetry tasted totally fresh with more coffee than milk , which was exactly the way I like a coffee to be . I do not like the type of Coffee with a 'fruity' sourish aftertaste. Skinny milk and soya milk were available. My friend told me that she enjoyed her Meatball Croissant. She cited the Meatball tasted handmade and not instant. She said that her Long Black was nice too. Service and Hospitality The service was the gem. The young male staff who attended to us was warm and attentive. He took time to take our order and listen to my request that I wanted a drink with more coffee and less milk. He recommended Piccolo to me and I was delighted with the drink that I had Teo cups that day. The western culture seems to view checking with the customers 'How is your food?' as the ideal/standard thing to do in the food industry. The staff at Symmetry did not do that but I appreciate it much better. I do not like to be interrupted in the midst of my meal. So , this standard protocol of service is not my cup of tea. The checking how- is-my-food type of service did come across as unnecessary. The staff did it because they were trained to do so but their expressions usually did not seem that they care that much . The service provided by the staff at Symmetry was warm and attentive. He knows his menu well too . These are the things which matter to me. I had a great brunch at Symmetry!
4
Interesting breakfast menu with large portions. The ambience is decidedly Melbourne hipster, but without any pretension. Friendly and energetic staff. Yummy food and good coffee. If you like cold brew -it comes served with a slice of orange. Very tasty. Only negative was a forgotten round of coffees at the end of our meal that we had to ask for repeatedly. It was coming on to the turnover time (set times for brunch), so I think the staff were flat out on their feet. We will definitely be back. A really nice joint
5
We ordered truffle tagliatelle and medallion of monkfish for dinner here and they were amazing. The monkfish was particularly *spectacular* - it was perfectly cooked and wrapped with cured ham, combined with mushroom risotto, broccoli stem, and sweet potato puree. Will definitely come back here next time we're in Singapore and try the brunch menu and coffee next! Heard they were amazing as well.
2
I disagree with the average rating of this place. We both ordered the big breakfast. It's apparently supposed to be funky (bacon with maple syrup, butter with some fruit). I can only say it was all a mismatch. We ate half of it and left the rest. Our waiter came and asked whether we were done. No question whether we enjoyed our food. No question why we only ate half. That was very disappointing. Other than that staff was friendly, coffee was good, all in all a nice place. Can't even say it's oberprized. But tastewise disappointing. And service wise - when it comes to the quintessential - also.
5
Wish we had found this place a few days ago. We were staying around the corner at a hotel with the worst breakfast I have ever experienced. Anywhere. Ever. The coffee was amazing. The food unreal. The service fabulous. I imagine lunch dinner and the bar would be equally excellent!
3
A cafe for the young and young-at-heart. It was packed to the rafters for Sunday brunch. So definitely make a reservation, and don't show up unannounced. The food is decent and the service is very good. Servers are attentive and the food came promptly in spite of how busy it was. My only complaint is that the music was a tad too loud! Perhaps this is a place you go to be seen and not heard... :
4
Visited Symmetry for a Monday brunch. Tried the Portobello & Burrata and the Braised Spiced Lamb Shank. Both were delicious ! Being a Monday, the cafe was not crazy packed which was a good thing - a good place to chill out.
5
Nice and friendly service crew. As I was there for dinner, the portions were small but the food is good and unique. Very good ambiance too.
4
Should go for the brunch instead of dinner. There are more choices to choose from the menu compare to dinner menu. The services are lack of a bit where they did not provide you water (sky juice) even though you didn't order for drinks.
5
First time I visited it and loved it. A bit expensive but worth it.
We asked for the chef's choice and a bottle of French wine and we spent a nice evening.
Great music and relaxed ambience.
5
The service very good, atmosphere very pleasant and the food cooked to perfection.
We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here.
5
Great service and great food. Been coming here for years and it's still a good place to be and the quality has not dropped
5
Good service, good atmosphere, food was ok. Good place for gathering with friends or family. Recommended.
4
Went there for a meal with my friend who has traveled in from Brunei, and chose this place due to the location which is close to her hotel. We've ordered Miso Cod, Potato Fries infused with Truffle and Symmetry Muesli. I must say we enjoyed the Miso Cod the best, especially the broth which was really tasty and the fish was cooked perfectly.We really love the environment and the whole experience, the prices are a little steep though
5
Prior to a recent business meeting, a colleague suggested we have lunch at this venue.. once I found it (it is not conspicuous) i was blown away. Simple but wonderful food at reasonable prices with super service.Its quite a delight.. small.. cozy and loved it
4
One of the few to fulfill the needs of Singapore of having good cafes and casual brunch and dinner places. It was a Sunday morn brunch for us and I must say it was a nice cozy place with a typical Sunday ambience. Lovely drinks menu, was quite pricey but then, till the country has the options, you got to pay up. Quite tight on the menu though which I would normally like but even fewer for veggies. With a flexibility for eggs, you could get a few options but poor my wife had only one choice and had to make do with it. Why can't Singapore be like the food capitals of Tokyo, New York, London and restaurants have veggie varieties. Would urge the management of symmetry to introduce a few more vegetarian dishes on the menu, greens don't hurt anyone. Nice, warm and friendly staff and service too to provide some flexibility. Definitely worth a visit.
4
The 2 staff are very friendly and helpful. The Manager is very rigid on last order and closing time. Our experience would be better if she puts it in a nicer manner.
4
I like the brunch here, and was here for dinner this time. The duck risotto was good. The duck and the risotto matched really well. There's also free grapes as snacks
5
Enjoyed the experience, but pricey. Had the linguine and the ocean trout. Delicious. Nice place for a date :)
4
Restaurant was quiet and service was fast on a weekday morning. Good food and good atmosphere. Definitely will be coming back!
5
Cafe by the day, bar for the night. We had hearty big breakfast which kept us filling for the day! Love it~
5
A nice gathering at Café Goot space and arrangement.
Very nice food and table service provided.
The staff is very attentive of our needs.
Even we have a baby around.
Cost around 30+ for per pax for drink and main dish
5
Food and service was good. Ambience was a plus point as well.
Will be back for more. A place to chill/girls day out/dates.
3
Nice food but expensive~ table arrangement are a little tight with minimal walking space~ will only visit again if there's a promotion =)
5
We've been coming to symmetry for a number of years, and it is one of our favorite brunch venues in sg. After a strong start it went through a period where the food seemed a bit tired and so so. But I'm glad to say that symmetry is back to its best! Excellent across the menu. We had the eggs bene and asparagus and crab salad. Sublime, full of flavour and surprising and thoughtful combinations of ingredients. Had the flan a few weeks ago, and if you can wear the calories is excellent. The service has always been friendly, though can be hit and miss during busy times. Certainly worth a visit
3
Food was just alright and slightly on the expensive side. Would not say it was totally value for money. The tables were also too cramped together and the cafe noisy when we were there. Was very hard to have a proper conversation. I probably wouldn't return
3
Went there on a weekday night and it was not crowded compared to years ago on my last visit. Food standard seems to have drop a little and don't feel its worth the price. The pork belly was the saving grace. However service was good!
5
Excellent atmosphere with very unique interior design. Cosy and peaceful too which made conversations alot more comfy and relaxed.
5
Hidden away cool place in the back streets of Arab st area. Very good coffee! They even have soy milk available, which is hard to find in Singapore. Love the decor, and atmosphere is very relaxing and cozy.
3
Food is ok. But overpriced for a cafe. Mainly a Very warm and dark place, not spacious. not great for comfort
4
Great food and excellent quality. Portions a little small and food is on the pricey side but given the quality it's worth the splurge.
4
The venue is quite cozy with a great vibe. The menu is quirky in a great way and the food was very tasty. We loved the service and how the team took the time to check on us. Would definitely be going back again!
3
A good place to chill out. Limited indoor seats. Food is good. Pricey for cafe food. Gets crowded near to lunch time.
4
A hip, unique interior. The cocktails are well crafted, but too expensive. $21-22 for a cocktail is on the high end of the range. The cocktail was good, but the service was so slow to deliver food and drinks that the main hesitation for ordering another was that we didn't want to wait for it
4
Great hipster brunch place with excellent Australian-style coffee and cool decor. However, for the price you would expect the meals to be a little bit more special - we payed $66 for two brunches & two coffees and what we got would probably only cost $40 back in Australia
4
First time visiting the place and was thoroughly pleased! Walk was a short one from Bugis MRT and easy to find. Food came promptly and freshly made. Was a little put off when the waitress told us that we had to vacate the table at a certain time when we first arrived, despite making a reservation. Other than that, ambience was great, staff were attentive and food was good. Would definitely visit again to try the other things on the menu! Also, I am a fan of crispy fries and their truffle fries were honestly fried to perfection
4
The food is really awesome, almost everything we ordered was delicious. But the cost is slightly above average compared to other cafes.
1
Squid risotto was terribly salty. Was almost inedible. Other food options were good. Just don't choose this one.
5
Excellent service from the staff. Very friendly and helpful. Spontaneous response.
Place is abit cramped but its acceptable.
5
One of the most delicious eggs benedicts I've ever had - mushroom ragout on muffins topped with eggs and wrapped in maple glazed bacon. Divine. The flat white was exceptional. 10/10 will come again
5
This place has a nice ambience, for those looking for a place for a dinner and drink to chat and chill. Food was excellent, and be sure to ask for happy hour beer if you're the early diner.
5
Loved this spot for a morning business coffee- chill vibe good smoothies and great caffeine fix. Sweet service.
5
We were looking for a relaxed dinner out... with a special twist. and had heard from friends that Symmetry (which is in the Arab Street area) had that 'secret something' that's not as easy to find in Singapore as you might think. The moment we walked in, it was apparent what they were talking about. Staff was friendly and cool, and decor was trendy yet welcoming - meanwhile, the bartender was hard at work shaking up some kind of cocktail that looked extremely tempting ! We decided to start off with the Burrata with san marzano tomatoes and fig compote. The serving was generous, and the original mix of flavors was totally delicious. We continued with the wagyu tartare with pain de campagne (and more) - and loved the combination of remoulade, egg yolk, and pickles - a fresh and scrumptious take on the original French version. By the time we got to the mains, we realized the portion size and and opted to share a mouthwatering special Symmetry burger of braised beef cheek on a charcoal bun with truffle fries - pure indulgence. Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to for desserts this time - but luckily the coffee is exquisite! Due to the excellent vibe and awesome food (not to mention generous pours of wine...), this is definitely someplace we will return very soon - with fun foodie friends
4
Had our breakfast there, deco of the place is rustic and simple. I especially like the details given to the cutlery, all metallic and look interesting.I had Flan and my friend Spanish Eggs, both are well cooked, tasty and portion just right. We also ordered cappuccino and iced latte, the cappuccino comes with a gingerbreadman biscuit which was really nice.Food is cooked to perfection. However, I think the service can be improved. Not that the attendants were rude, just that they pretty much ignore our presence
2
Came here because of positive reviews, but was not impressed. Food average and very overpriced. I kind of feel they try to act as cool French cafe/bakery for brunch which is not working for me. On Sunday, they menu lacks practically any food without eggs. When I asked waiter for eggs-free options, he recommended to take regular dishes but without eggs. Also, I felt wierd that you are not served any pastery (bread , toast) when you eat heavy sausage. You get it, when you pay extra. 2.5/
4
The food at symmetry was superb, though we were initially served the wrong beer, they give us the correct one after pointing it out and also gave us the other bottle on the house. The Kurobuta Pork Cheek was the best! Their truffle fries were very nice too, just that I felt it had a tad bit lesser of truffle as compared to the previous time I visited. Lastly, the Mexican Ruby cocktail I had was a little too sweet. Overall I had a fantastic experience
4
Symmetry's staff are very prompt and attentive. The food selection is good. My family and I had a good time. Thanks!
4
Great coffee find in Singapore. Cool interior, friendly staff. The coffee and the milkshakes were great. Worth the visit
3
Heard alot of good reviews but apparently it will be My first and Last Visit.
Food taste normal and pricey. Average for 2 pax is about $40.
4
This is my second time there. Atmosphere is nice although music is too loud. Staff is friendly and food is good.
5
Hipster maybe! We were here on a Saturday night when Cold Play were in town. The place was atypically almost empty. The next morning it was packed. Terrific atmosphere, interesting food, great coffee plus the the last supper en animal!!! Hipster YES!!
5
My wife and I are in town for a few days, symmetry was recommended by vagabond hotel (nearby and great too). Delicious food - we had scallops , tuna salad and charcuterie plate with wines and sake both by the glass. Ok, followed by a couple of whiskys. The staff are friendly, quick, the wines are a well chosen list and the food was perfect. Give Symmetry a go
4
I like the casualness of this place but I cannot say the menu is extensive. Having break and eggs for lunch, which seems to be a fad in recent days, is still something I need to get used to. Having said I applaud the quality and originality of the food. I also enjoyed the waffle as dessert
5
When we first entered, we were given the menu as well as a glass of grapes, and we knew we were in for an atas meal. The place was dim, quiet and cosy. We ordered the truffle fries (because it was recommended by so many blog posts) and Pan Seared Hokkaido Scallops. Truffle firies were decent while I really liked the scallop dish - mostly impressed by the batter fried corn kernels that lined the plate. There were only 4 scallops for $21, which I honestly think is quite pricey. For the mains, we tried the lamb shank (which was really good; meat was tender and tasty) and the baked cod (which came with clams and alot of beans; not bad too). The food quality was there, but it came at a pretty high price. But service was really good. I may consider going back there for brunch
5
Arrived for a late lunch at near 1:30pm on a Thursday. Tried the braised Angus beef cheek at the recommendation by the staff. Turned out to be a really good choice! Well simmered so very flavourful, soft but held together very nicely too. Very good experience for my first visit. Will definitely come back
5
I was there with a friend and had their big breakfast and it was absolutely delicious. Price can be a bit on the high side but you get what you pay for. Had flat white as well - the food and drinks all hit the right spot. Will definitely return for more
4
Overall, the food presented were unique and the services provided were good as the servers were patient and tried to cater to our needs as much as they could. Ambience is suitable for chillout and celebratory occasions.
5
The brunch menu and drinks aren't so bad either! Sit at the bar and you could get lucky to be entertained by the barista with some drink sampling. It's our third visit for Saturday brunch.
5
The interior of the cafe is so cozy and very vintage! We had the symmetry brunch that is available on weekdays. I love the mushrooms and the I could really taste the truffle oil in it :)
3
The Sunday Roast was disappointing. The yorkshire puddings were thin, flat, soggy - as opposed to cup-shaped, crisp. The sausage was so-so. The wagyu steak and sauce however was tender and paired well together.
Great vibes to the place though
5
Always happy to be back for more at Symmetry. Best eggs, best coffee and amazing ambience. You'll never leave the restaurant hungry.
4
Had brunch on a Sunday afternoon with friends. The food portion was big!! ( I had a Big Breakfast lol) Love the cheesy juicy sausage so much!
3
Had brunch on Saturday morning. Food can be improved for some dishes. Service not too bad. However the price of the food are on the high side.
4
Creamy spinach and gooey cheese made the sur le plat surprisingly tasty! The coffees were the icing on the cake! Would make our way here again 😃
2
Pros:Good brunch!Plenty of beer selectionCool decorIntimateCons:There is absolutely nothing great about a place when you are given at time limit to enjoy great food with friends. And waitress was neither shy nor polite about it. Right after finished ordering, she told us what time we have to leave.Soooo, unless you are an all you can eat buffet, it just takes out the good vibe from a supposedly good place.Gave 2 for excellent brunch tho. Thumbs down for greeting, customer service, and every other human-aspect of running a restaurant

Been wanting to return since brunch couple of years back. Finally managed to have dinner and it did not disappoint. Interior and ambience remains charming dispite passing years. We ordered mushroom croquettes, burratta and baked cod and everything was well cooked with balanced flavours, nothing fancy but taste was good. Special callout to the great service staff from the time we arrive @ 830pm till we left @ 130am. Great engagement, authentic and attentive service. They were even flexible with additional order of wine past usual closing time. Will defiantly be back

lovely restaurants decoration. Food was good however price wise, it's very expensive. service was great.
4
Good Food and Good Service. Prices are slightly steep but that would generally be the case at most places these days.
4
The food was decent but I noticed quinoa was missing from my salad which was stated on the menu and instead they gave me two slice of bread without notifying me.
4
Cosy café with nice decorations. Food is pretty good but pricey. Love the cupucino because they used 3 mixed bean. Will go again to try the Sunday brunch.
4
Came in at opening (9am) for breakfast but had to wait until 9:30 for the kitchen to open. Worth the wait, good coffee, great big breakfast - chicken cheese sausage is magnificent and the berry butter on the toast is unique and yummy. A little on the pricey side but you are paying for good stuff
4
Visited Symmetry for a few times! Never feel doubt for their food! Ordered crab and corn croquette and 2 main courses! Perfect taste! The lady who was wearing spec and the man with apron ( he is the one who always make nice coffee) was very friendly! Ordered 2 cocktails and this time made by a bargirl. She was very quiet but she smiled to us always

I ate here on my recent business trip. The restaurant has great decor and an interesting menu. There was only 3 people eating in the restaurant in this particular evening so really no excuses with what was to follow. I ordered the rib of beef with Foie gras and subterranean vegetables. The beef was tender but unseasoned and was luke warm. The foie gras was actually cold in the centre along with the vegetables. I am figring the vegetables are precooked or something as they had a nice glaze to them . On top of this the people in the bar were more interested in chatting to themselves than serving . When i did give the same feedback about the above (having left food on my plate), there was no aoplogy or explanation,. They just took the plate away, I did order a cocktail then to wash away my disappointment which I have to say was amazing. Fresh passionfruit exploded through the flavour. Also the Barman who chatted to me was very nice and professional. I suggest that if this place was up to speed and i got it on a good night, the food would be good. but to pay 95 Singapore dollars for one course, a cocktail and a glass of wine and get this sort of standard is unnacceptable
4
Came here over the weekend and tried their coffee which was really good! I love the decor and the ambiance at the cafe. We did have a look at the menu and it looks really good, however as we didn't have time, we didn't end up ordering anything.I will definitely come back to try the food
3
I remember being blown away by their brunch the very first time i was at symmetry when they opened. Tried their dinner this time but the magic's gone. Not that food wasn't good - the squid ink risotto was pretty tasty - but not something id die to return fo
4
Had a dessert, some nectarine thingy n two cocktails. The red cocktail is called candy shop, not as sweet as it sounds but acceptable. The other is symmetric, nice n sour with a hint of alcohol. Both are very pretty! Shall try their mains next time, though i wished tge menu had more variety. Service was ok, but place was really cold. On the pricy side
4
Staffs were friendly. Tho abit pricey but quality is worth it. Great ambience. Recommend ed for gatherings and couples
5
Had my Valentine's Day celebration here this year. Dinner was awesome. Thank you so much for making this evening a very special one. My Boyfriend has prior arrangements with the bar manager to surprise me with the bouquet of flowers :) absolutely loving the place.
3
Food portion is small and costly. Not worth the price. Taste was just so so. Atmosphere was good but don think I will be back again.
5
Excellent variety of western brunch choice. Tasty food and beverages, however quantity size could be more generous. Excellent service staff.
5
Dropped by on a Sunday and found the place to be pretty full, thankfully I had reserved a place. Tables are fairly spaced apart and I felt comfortable. I had the symmetry big breakfast and almost everything about it is good, I found nothing to complain. In fact symmetry is one of the few places that deserves the price it commands — a rarity in today's crowded fnb scene. Worth a visit
5
I can't name a single dish that is less than great. Whoever the chef is, he/she is a genius. Waffle during brunch is a must-try. Service is always awesome.Now I just wish I had higher tolerance for alcohol to be able to drink more than 1 cocktail each visit
4
Dont get me wrong, food is ok. But its the price u pay for overall experience. Has good service and art direction. Yes although above its price range for the food. Worth it on overall package. Had brunch there and now dinner. Both meals were nice. Just be prepared its not a budget choice. But it can be a good choice depending on your perspecrive and intentions
4
Had my saturday brunch there and it was pretty enjoyable. food was served pretty quickly too! there were sitting outside but we made a reservation to be indoor so not really sure if it will be too hot if you were to choose a sitting outside. but overall, it was a pretty good experience
3
It was late afternoon and I decided to eplore the area. Symmetry caught my attention with its Industrial design. So I went in with a good impression of the shop but It endsup as a dissapointing experience mainly because of the service.Here are the few things that I noticed.1. The people working at that time aren't smiling and doesnt have any eye contact.From some strange reason It made me feel really uncomfortable.2. Lack of interaction.3. No body check back whether my food is ok or I need anything on my table.4.No one is atttentive to clear my plates.I hope the Management would follow up on these matter.
4
It is a hip cafe and does a pretty good brunch. Restaurant is small but it has sizeable tables that give you good dining space. Food is above average and price is on the high side. Eggs Benedict was $22, Symmetry Eggs $24 and muesli $16.
5
Nice environment! Comfort and cozy cafe with presentable food! Love the big breakfast set and egg Benedict
5
We ordered Symmetry Big Breakfast and Portobello & Burrata, both exceeded our expectations! On top of that, iced long black is good too!
3
Nice & cosy. Luckily it wasn't all too packed on a Thursday night. Duck risotto & tiramisu was both okay.
5
Nice ambience but the mentaiko pasta is a tad dry and cod fish is very small. My friend ordered the lamb belly and it tastes good!
3
The restaurant staffs did not provide a very good service - not very friendly and not smiling to you.
3
Arrived early, plenty of free tables available but the serving staff sat us right next to the coffee grinder and loud speaker.
Food was as expected, not outstanding but serving size and quality appropriate.
4
I genuinely think this place has the best eggs Benedict in Singapore. I crave them now! The lattes are to die for as well. They also have excellent cold Brew coffee. This place is a must if you want to have a good breakfast before exploring Arab Street or the rest of Singapore!
4
Dined here today and had a good experience. A cosy cafe located at Jalan Kubor. Can get a little crowded at lunch time considering it's a weekday. We had symmetry brunch. Loved the truffle smell to the mushrooms and scrambled eggs. Was a great way to begin the day. Music was a little loud so it's difficult to have conversations. Otherwise, it's a very good experience. Thumbs up!
3
It's a Saturday 1pm brunch. I arrived but all indoor seats were taken. I sat outside which was a bit hot but not too bad. The music was quite good though. I ordered a sandwich thinking it was a lighter choice. Turned out it looked like a burger. Together with an ice coffee it's quite pricey though which costs me $35. With this price I might opt for a cafe nearby as there are lots or other choices around the corner which are much cheaper with about the same quality. It would be a nice choice for a drink or hangout with friends though

Went to Symmetry during lunch time around 2pm on a Saturday. Just the right amount of customers there that it didn't look dead but enough to create great ambiance. The place: The Venue and place itself is beautiful/cool and very trendy. I can see why it's a great place for a bar. The staff were very attentive and friendly. Also very quick to respond to any queries. We were able to get our food relatively quickly. The Coffee: Coffee was well made, nothing spectacular but competitively priced and pretty normal for whatever it was. My family had the lattes and I had an Americano. No complaints.The Food: The food I felt was quite a let down. I personally like to go to lunches/brunches and get nice big portions for cheaper prices than if I were to have a main during dinner at a restaurant. Unfortunately this was not the case as I was left still quite hungry at the end of my meal. The price is what made me rate the value so poorly because as yummy as my dish was (Spanish Eggs), there simply wasn't enough for a young man such as myself to eat happily. My brother had sausages and he felt they were unfortunately not fresh, or at least not fresh tasting. My mum had the Symmetry Eggs and was very pleased, especially with the cream spinach so that is the saving grace here.Final thoughts: Ultimately the price to size of portion ratio is my only complaint about Symmetry as each one of the staff members were extremely welcoming, gracious and helpful. I only wish I had more to eat.This place is probably way cooler as a bar so I'll give that a try next time.Perhaps something Symmetry can implement are cheaper addons so for the more hungry customers, they can still get a full stomach without breaking the bank? Best of the lunch to the place in the future for continued success
4
Nice place, Nice art at the wall, good service and great drinks menu. We van recomment the cold pressed coffee and the cocktail with sake!
4
fantastic place for brunch because of the wonderful food. the homemade ice tea is perfect on a hot day as well.
5
Went to Symmetry Cafe for brunch yesterday and the whole experience was wonderful! Everything we ordered, from the drinks + coffee to sous vide eggs and meat, was perfectly made. The staff was also very helpful and friendly. Top spot!
3
Nice small cozy cafe and this is a good place if you are willing to pay. The brunch food quality is much better than heir weekday lunch or dinner menu.
4
Food was really good, not the usual brunch you see way too often at every single brunch place out there. Like the ambient too, cosy and will reco to anyone I know.
5
Food is great and makes for an awesome, value-for-money Sunday brunch, taking into consideration the very good quality of ingredients used. Ambience-wise, the interior is a bit of a squeeze and can get rather noisy if it does become packed (which it often is).
5
It was a brilliant dining experience at Symmetry. The food was very flavourful and wholesome, especially the Spanish eggs. Service was very very consistent as well - when asked to provide recommendations, they were very clear of the signature dishes to try and took care of us the whole way. Thank you, 10/10 will recommend
5
Good choice of adding ikura to squid ink risotto to balance out the tastes. Happy to have my tastebuds pampered. Truffle fries is $12 for a small cupful portion. Expected more from the chope recommended pork cheek dish. Can afford to be more juicy and tender
3
There happened to be a special festive menu on the day we went. The 2 items we wanted to try, wagyu striploin and slow braised pork collar, were both sold out! So we ended up with a beef stroganoff sandwich, which was underwhelming for its price. We also had the duck leg croissant, unfortunately the croissant was a bit hard. The trout too, was a bit fishy. Disappointing dinner experience!
5
firstly i would like to thank all the staffs from Symmetry for being so accommodating. i've arrived with a group of 5 ladies and 1 baby. it was raining and the staffs offered to lend us umbrellas to fetch our friends who are stuck in the rain nearby. (how kind was that :
5
Love the food, the ambience the coffee! It's always our 'come back again' brunch place when we ran out of brunch places ideas.
5
Love the ambience. location was a short walk from Bugis mrt, but away from the maddening crowd. there's instagram worthy corners all around the cafe/restuarant. Food was good but a bit on the pricey side.
5
Great food, ambiance and service. Seats were available to us during our reservation timing. Very satisfied with the overall experience!
4
A stone's throw away from Bugis MRT, Symmetry is the perfect place to relax at after shopping. The food here is pretty pricy by my standards, but I thoroughly enjoyed the cod carbonara.
3
Norm service as service staffs were busy talking among themselves. Had a hard time asking them to take our orders! Music was too loud that we have to raise our voice to talk. Food were not really fantastic.
5
Cool modern restaurant, great food and really cool vibe. Really good coffee and the menu was awesome. Great location just by bugis mrt 👌
3
The Food is nice and has quality as expected, but a little pricey though. The service is good and attentive.
4
Good food with good environment, can be a bit crowded but that shows the popularity of the cafe. Good service as well
5
Warning, price looks okay at first but it has around 20% of additional taxes.
Otherwise, enjoy the food, its really good. Coffee, good. Booze, expensive.
3
Came down to Symmetry on 27/10/2016 and ate scallops and duck risotto. The staff were very attentive in the beginning and the ambience was great. However, for $21 the scallops were very little (5 pieces) and the duck risotto was quite salty in the long run.My friend who ate the short ribs found her foie gras to be too fatty and not as tasty. We both ordered drinks- the berries mojito was tasty and she had a Hacker kellerbier. Eventually, when we wanted to pay the bill, the staff were busy and shorthanded and took awhile to get back to us despite us waving and waving. But it was still a good dinner experience, but a little too pricey for our experience.
4
I have been to symmetry more than 5 times and the quality of their meals have always been consistent! Love the scrambled eggs and maple glazed bacon especially!
5
Food was great and coffee is fantastic. One of the best for coffee. The duck risotto is consistently good. I tried the foie gras burger - it was very good. Worth a try.
5
I had the pork belly and it was done to perfection. These guys really know how to work their flavours, superb!
5
Love this place! Food & Beverage is interesting & value for money. Service here is great too. This place has been always crowded, first time visiting for lunch. Nicer to come on weekend to beat the weekend crowd!
5
Visited for drinks where we were welcomed with friendly edficient staff members. Service was excellent, wonderful choice of drink and food in a casual modern nice atmosphere with a welcoming environment. thankyou we will be visiting again next time we are in singapore.
5
I've been here numerous times and I love the vibe when you walk into the restaurant. Pricing wise it is $$$ out of 5 but it is worth it. Portions are good and the taste is better! I especially like the mentaiko pasta ❤️❤️❤️
5
After a long day on feet we where just looking for the deserved good night beer and found this place by chance.
Unbelievable friendly staff. Stylish menu. Relaxed atmosphere. Definitely worth going there again for a real dinner.
4
Did a reservation of 6 but had to be early at 9.45am. Ordered big breakfast, steak and the lamb sausage from the brunch menu. Food is good but servings a tad small. The avocado gula Melaka milkshake is delicious but I would love a larger glass for that price.
3
First impressions here are excellent with a buzzing atmosphere and young crowd. The service is good and fast.The food presentation is very good.The first bite is great. And then sadly, the sweetness gradually becomes too much. The flavours of the food are dampened by a sugarryness pervading everything.The thumping music inside makes conversation a shouting battle. Which is sad because the place is really rather promising.And the bill... well it's not cheap
3
Place is cute and cosy. Service is good. Food looks good but the taste is bland. I had the merguez sausage dish and something is missing from the taste. The cold brew coffee is an acquired taste. It is like eating a block of dark chocolate with orange peel with no added sugar. Drinks are exorbitantly priced (SGD11-13 for special teas/juices)
4
The place is a bit noisy but nice, food is good, tried the affogato which was nicely prepared. Had some pasta with crab and pesto. Simple but good. Might be a bit expensive but regular money for the area.
3
I enjoyed the toys for decor. Brought fun memories and chat. Food was tasty. Mostly eggs, but some sweet too. Kids were there, so families were enjoying too.
5
We ordered the beef schnitzel, miso cod pasta, crab pesto pasta, steak sandwich and truffle fries ... They were all very yummy, beautifully seasoned and portions weren't overly big like they do in western countries. Coffees (cafe lattÃ©) were excellent (according to 2 coffee connoisseurs in our group). Definitely worth a trip for people who appreciate good coffees and great food.
4
Coffee is very good. Food is tasty and the waffles were fantastic! Seating wise, is a bit tight and music was on the loud side (apparently they aren't able to lower the volume for some tech reason) but the staff are accommodating and friendly. Reminds me of cafes back in Oz. We are looking forward to visiting again
5
One of my colleagues introduced me to Symmetry. It's my first time in Singapore and i am so glad that i visited this hidden gem! Love the atmosphere, food and drinks! We didn't make a reservation and luckily we got a seat at the bar. The bartender was very nice chatting with us and gave us some free drinks to try! I will definitely come back again next time
3
Went there for brunch with my Boyfriend on a weekend, made a reservation thankfully as it was a full house . Really like the design of the cafe, really unique and had a great vibe to it.However the menu was pretty limited, choices mainly consisted of eggs done different ways so if you didn't want to have eggs you'll be stuck with limited options. Had the truffle fries which was a rip off, 16sgd for a plate of fries that were average tasting, hammock dish, incredibly salty and was hard to swallow. Mushroom cream pasta dish was blend, habitat cafe serves a better plate. Coffee was good and they had a good selection of drinks to choose from. Staff that sat us down were fast and efficient but it was really busy so it's a little hard to commend on their personal service. Would I go back? Maybe not since there are other options that serve a better brunch at affordable prices.
5
Great atmosphere, welcoming staff, good food and excellent coffee (including chill filtered awesomeness)...what more could you want? Stayed in hotel next door so visited everyday for coffee and some nights for meal / drinks. Loved the acoustic playlist.The venue seems to attract mainly cool looking younger people (20s/30s).Have a good 'happy hour' - yesterday a happy hour single malt was on offer for $8
3
We were walking there and did not realize that we reached the cafe as it was so quiet on a Sunday morning. When we pushed the door open, only we found out that the cafe was already quite occupied. We had eggs ben and scrambled egg with mushrooms. The breakfast was good and filling. The environment was cozy too. All in all, it's a hearty cafe worth a visit but the food were expensive
3
It's such a shame, as the quality of the food in this place seems amazing. Sad that the options are so limited, and when you ask for a replacement on a dish, they think it's ok to give you a pea sized amount. While the food tasted good, it was expensive for the portion size I got; I left starving :
2
If you come for brunch you better like eggs! Not many selection available, they could be more creative. The merguez I had was a little gamey. Bread was nice but overall super cute decor, nice coffee, eggs everything.. I don't know how to differentiate it from any other hipster coffee / restaurant
2
no worth, so bad for the food and drink.
we're so dissaipointed to having a dinner there.
dunt know why that place is always crowded.
5
Great eggs benedict and this having compared it with eggs benedict from some of the top places in Melbourne. The environment is also relaxed and perfect for a leisurely brunch. Coffee was pretty good as well. Highly recommended!
4
Stopped for a couple of drinks on way back to our hotel. Sat outside with the local cats and chilled (so to speak). Drinks - particularly the wine - seemed expensive but service friendly and very good so not complaining :) Lovely evening.
1
Great brunch place if you like eggs. Not so great if you don't, because that is all they serve. Coffee is good and service friendly.
4
This place offers good food at reasonable price for Singapore. It seems to get more busy in the evening.
5
We were staying close by at the Park Royal Beach Hotel (near the Arab quarter) and this café was in easy walking distance. We are not keen on hotel breakfasts (mainly because of the standard of the coffee) and were pleased to find this place which opens 9.30 at weekends, 10.30 other days and serves excellent coffee and a great range of tasty snacks and meals. My wife also enjoyed the healthy juices on offer
5
I went to this place for coffee yesterday. I ordered only Flat White coz already full from lunch buffet from other restaurant. My coffee artwork was super cute with minion image. The aroma, acidity, body, flavor and aftertaste was just perfect. I was really enjoyed my coffee here. The service was attentive and friendly. The ambiance indoor and outdoor was quite nice. Definitely will return for more coffee and may try the food and desserts next time too
5
With so many restaurants mushrooming every other week in Singapore, it's hard to find one that stays true to what it sets out to do, and do it with aplomb at that. Symmetry is one such gem. Tucked in one corner of Jalan Kubor, it is part restaurant, part cafe, part bar. But a whole lot of rustic authentic charm. Like many hipster places these days, it has the prerequisite decor of exposed brick walls, dim mood lights, cool young waiting staff, and modern twist of the usual fare. But unlike most places, these guys have managed to strike an equilibrium so everything comes together. Like, well pardon the pun, in symmetry. The menu changes. There is a Monday menu, weekday lunch, dinner, and the weekend brunch. Some of my favourites include Duck Leg Confit, Crispy Baby Squid, Big Breakfast, Minute Steak, and Symmetry Benedict. They serve a mean cappuccino and latte as well. The drinks menu is equally tantalizing. Special mention to the Iced Thai Milk Tea, Lychee Mint, Fresh Grapefruit Citron Presse.But the pièce de résistance is actually none of the above.It's actually the service. The wait staff may be young, but they are extremely well-trained. They take the initiative, are extremely attentive, friendly, helpful when they need to, but still give you space when you need privacy. Perfect harmony.Keep up the great work guys
4
I came here for lunch today with a friend. I opted for the pasta carbonara whilst she selected the more sensible option of the brunch. We had a small bottle of sake to wash it down. Food was very tasty but my meal was a little small - still hungry afterwards. Service was friendly but a little disorganised (quite a bit of confusion)
5
Symmetry is a lovely little casual restaurant in Jalan Kubor. It is very nicely decorated and has great food - we had a generous serving of foie gras, followed by croquettes, an octopus/chorizo dish, a scallop dish and a very good risotto. Food is very reasonably priced too
5
Great trendy fast food, delicious sandwiches and drinks. Very nice decor, trendy and stylish. Free wifi. Will definitely come back when in Singapore.
5
This is my Go To place when I have visitors in Singapore. The coffee is excellent, food is great with generous serves and I highly recommend the juices. I find the wait staff pleasant and attentive.
4
Visited on F1 weekend. Found this place opposite our hotel (Santa Grande) and tbought we would try it for some refreshments before heading track side for the Grand Prix. Cocktails were excellent. Shrimp tacos well worth a try too! Morning after the night before and coffee is needed, look no further than this place. Really good coffee, comparable to Melbourne standards. Unfortunately, I struggled to order to waffles with maple syrup for breakfast, and therefore opted for waffles with fried chicken and a side of french fries, wierd but I am a little strange
1
I sent them a message through FB messeger to check on the operating hours 2 weeks before my trip to SG and I was told they open on 9am onwards (on Monday). Me and another 3 friends arrived at their door step at 10am and realised they are not open yet. So we ask the staff on duty and he informed us they open on 10.30am onwards. Fine, we stood outside under the hot sun and waited for them, and we are not offered drinks or menu to look at. Looking at your customers stood under the sun and sweat without offering a seat first is so unprofessional. Then, the time finally hits 10.30am and we walked in again. Guess what, we were told that the kitchen only opens at 11am. Seriously? The staff should have informed us about this when we arrived at 10am! He just wasted 30mins of our time for nothing! And also, his face expression told us that he is not keen to serve us, no smile, no greetings when we step in, nothing. No matter how good your food is, hospitality and customer service are always priority. So so so dissapointed. Nuff said. Not going to visit for my next SG trip
4
Lovely cafe for brunch - close to Arab St and Bugis. I love sitting outside and watching the world go by while enjoying the slightly unusual brunch options at this friendly cafe. The menu seems to have just been refreshed with even more choice. I've repeatedly been told this place serves the best Eggs Benedict in town, but I keep getting tempted by other options
3
Had Symmetry Benedict and Pork croissant. Food is good actually. Symmetry Benedict has a good mix of taste. Minced portobello mushroom on english muffin with nicely done eggs. Bacon is on the fatty side. Pork croissant has a flavour slightly on the heavy side. Thickly sliced pork with caramelized onion with scramble egg between croissant. Scramble is slightly under-spiced perhaps to balance the heavy taste of the pork and caramelized onion.Customer service is poor. Smiles and good attitude is only among colleagues and not towards the customer. Gives us the feeling that they are chasing us out even before we had our meal. Reached a little before 11am, sat us down and immediately tells us "this table is available only until 12." Requested to change table as it is directly under the AC. Waitress swapped us to another table and say "you have to leave by 1130am." (We are there only at 11am). Turns around and tells colleague "keeps changing table". Barely any proper service attitude except when checking out.Overall, food ok. If looking to relax and chat for a while, got to book your table
1
We walked in on Sunday at 4pm and the waitress asked us if we would like food or drinks. Grouchy face waitress! Wondered why such a question and we said both! The waitress replied they were out of waffles and too bad I had cravings for waffles and besides the raving pictures on their waffles looked so tempting. We sat for a good 10 minutes but they were no one to take our orders. The were not much crowd at 4pm; hence we left without even dining.Don't bother to dine with unfriendly waitress
5
I Was taken to this cafe from some brunch , as I entered I saw a sticker on the window giving a nod to lonely planet which immediately made me think this place must be worth it :) it's a small cute cafe with very mixed interior design but it all somehow worked in its own unique way , having read through other reviews , I was a bit worried about waiting time /quality of service/quality of food however I can honestly say it wasn't busy but had a buzz about the place , service was quick , we ordered a latte & Cappucino my sister had waffles and I had a chocolate banana layered cake couldn't fault anything it was all really yummy , I would recommend this place if your in the area , also like I did I would recommend taking a walk to haji lane it's only about 5 min walk away. And has lots of independent shops and the lane is very scenic full with graffiti so loads of picture opportunities , your local MRT station is bugis and from there symmetry is about 10min walk away , have fun it's definitely worth a visit to the area especially if your bored of taking photos of the normal Singapore sights ☺️ loads of thumbs up for this cafe
5
Tried this place twice for Saturday brunch and absolutely loved it! They offer one of the best brunches in town! The first time I went, I had (if I rmb correctly) eggs sur le plat and soy latte. The eggs sur le plat were soooo goooodddd <3Loved the atmosphere of the place too - a stylish laid-back feel to it. However, it can get quite crowded so either be early or be prepared to wait for a table
5
My friend and I went there on a rainy saturday night walking from Bugis and we werent dissapointed with our decision to dine there as despite without any reservations we went there and immediately were shown to a table which fitted perfectly for us. Service from the staffs were prompt and polite too. We order some appetizers and mains dish and they were delicious. The food also comes with nice presentation. Will definitely go back to try out other items on the menu
5
Happy Hour drinks are awesome as alcohol is sooooooo expensive in Singapore. Great service with a smile & always trying to please. Excellent meals, large portions reasonably priced. Would definitely come back here if in Singapore again!
4
awesome eggs with truffle oil and cute gingerbread cookie that came with the coffee. but only come here if you make an advanced reservation otherwise it's gonna be a long wait.
2
We ordered a big breakfast and egg benedict. First of all, the food arrived almost instantly.. instant service is good thing, but too instantly raises scepticism. And lo and behold, the first bite confirmed my apprehensions. The food was room temperature (almost bordering cold), right from the egg scramble, the sausage to the toast.. and all this for $25++ a serving. So we paid a total of $55... and $55 is a lot of money to spend in vain over an unsatisfying meal..Heard the coffee here is really good but we couldn't try it.. so no comments on that
4
Had to use the online reservation system to book a table (it is very hard to get a table on a weekend morning even one week ahead!).My most memorable part of the menu was the eggs benedict. Coffee and latte were good. Portions were huge, which correlates with a little-expensive price.The cafe is tiny and occupies only the ground floor of a pre-war shophouse lot but I love the decoration and the overall vibe. Crowded, yes, but they have pretty good crowd management and I appreciate the fact that they don't try to squeeze as many customers as they can just to make more money (knowing how popular they are).Will definitely come back if I run out of cafes to experiment in my never-ending list of cafes in Singapore
5
Made a reservation for brunch and we didn't even have to wait even though it was crowded. For a small place packed with good energy and vibes we were pretty impress. Service and food was great. Read a lot of reviews about being pricey I guess it's the typical restaurant price people pay in singapore /melbourne /london /New York for food like this. Definately coming back to check out their dinner menu
2
After reading reviews online (Tripadvisor & Burrple), I thought Symmetry would be really worth my time. However, I must say that I was sorely disappointed. I generally avoid writing negative reviews unless I feel like I am providing constructive criticism. The owners really need to step up the quality and review the pricing to entice people to come here. Ordered a cappuccino ($5.50) and a hot chocolate (i think $6.50). Considering that this cafe is "Australian-inspired", the coffee is nowhere up to scratch to an Australian coffee. Coffee was slightly bitter and I could not even taste the hint of sweetness from the steamed milk (no sugars in my coffee). And seriously, for the price of $5.50, I expected more. I would rather drive down towards the Lavender/Kallang direction and get my caffeine fix at a reasonable price of $4.50. My friend remarked that her hot chocolate tasted terrible. We ordered a side of Truffle fries and a main of Crab pesto linguine ($22) since we expected to have Brunch here (my fault for not checking that there's no brunch on weekdays) and my brunch buddy was not that hungry. Truffle fries ($15) was served in a large bucked and was generous in the portion but was definitely not the best I've had and a tad overpriced for fries in general. Crab pesto linguine was definitely palatable but nothing outstanding. Portion was sized that it could almost pass off as an entree in a restaurant. Overall, I must say that while the inside is pretty cosy, albeit a little messy looking, I will not be returning here. Even with the raving reviews for brunch, I would save my time, effort and money for somewhere else more deserving. My total came up to approx $60 after including GST and service charge

Honestly, this place is seriously over-rated. The queue and table management system was poor. Waiting time was beyond 15 minutes as stipulated on the online system.Latte was good but pricey. Food was incredibly pricey, though I didn't have it due to incredibly slow service and the reason being, that Saturday's are busy. For some reason, there is simply a lack of structure in the organisation of the cafe in terms of cooking, serving and tending to clients at the right time. For the price being charged, I expect a lot more from this place.Sort it out

I'd say this cafe is definitely over-rated. A friend of mine recommended me and I decided to pay a visit on the first Sunday of '15. I was hoping for a good meal since it was my last day in Singapore. It wasn't that much of a crowd cause it was around 3pm. My friend and I ordered the big breakfast, chocolate fudge cake and a cup of flat white. The cake was quite tasty and I was expecting the same on the main. Couple of minutes later, the meal came and what a surprise that the lady served me a big breakfast accompanied with SEVERAL ANTS. I thought I saw it wrong so when she put it down on the table, I took a good look once again. Yes, it was not just an ant, it was several ants strolling around the food. I called another staff and well, all she could say was sorry and then changed the food. I didn't have much of an appetite already. I could only imagine that they didn't take hygiene as priority- either the kitchen was dirty or the pantry.Anyway, my friend ate the big breakfast and said it wasn't that good. My flat white didn't come out as well. Of course I didn't bother to ask again as I have lost my appetite. Sorry have to say I won't be coming back nor recommend anyone

All round really great brunch. The service is with a smile and very efficient. The Bloody Mary was really special, the presentation and taste make it probably the best in town. We had the truffle fries, big breakfast and mushroom with eggs, they were all delicious: quality ingredients, cooked perfectly and very well presented. This is a very cool cafe with comfortable outside seating shaded by trees. I highly recommend checking it out.

Pros- Nice interior setupCons- Space is rather confined, probably 10-12 tables- Gaps between tables are fairly close which slight deprive privacy- Based on the menu, pricing looked steep at such a cafe setupI would like to comment on the crew's unprofessional service in this review. On Saturday evening, I requested a table of four but was ushered to linger at the bar counter to look at my menu. It was puzzling.We got a table after the third attempt. Finally.We were there simply for coffee and desserts. The crew gave a awkward reply and said, they only have the christmas dinner menu for the day. 30 minutes were wasted when we decided to place order.From the start, the crew should have indicated they only accept Christmas reservations and not walk-in customers for that day.We did not have the chance to try the food. Heard they have raving waffles.The choice is yours.IMO, I do not recommend this place. Spend your money elsewhere. This will be my first and last visit.Check out my photos

Everybody else got their food except me. and I ordered first .the service crew doesn't know how to manage the crowd . it wasn't even that packed to begin with

A very nice cozy place. Relaxed atmosphere and the food is fresa nd tasty and served with an eye to the presentation. I would recommend any plate my favourite is the granola frozen berries yogurt with a twist of fresh fruits. 18 dollars well spent.

Great brunch place with an outdoor area under the shade (and with massive fans). Good for dog owners. Food was good, and so was the coffee and milkshake. But the waffles was really the highlight for me!

This is my 2nd visit to Symmetry and their truffle oil fries is the one that brought me back again. Breakfast we had is nothing special with cheese sausage, harsh brown, scramble eggs, slice of salmon n greens.
5
this cafe is a five to ten minutes walk from Bugis MRT station. Good ambiance, a perfect brunch in the afternoon with my friend. Fast Service and the scramble egg is a must try. One of the best I have ever eaten so far in Singapore. Order the breakfast set. Every was just perfert. truffle fries was so good that we clear the entire bucket. Highly recommended

At first we thought we found a gem of a place. It looks exactly like the kind of cafe I'd like to own one day. Plenty of rustic and raw materials, with interesting trinkets to look at.The coffee was pretty good. I give the credit for that. But the steak sandwich and the ham/truffle burger were bad. We could not finish them, which is unusual for us. They need to take it back to basics, cut down the components and use better quality ingredients.It was by far the most expensive meal we had in Singapore, and by far the least enjoyable... Stick to the coffee.

I was here for Sunday brunch with my sister. Not sure if they allow reservation, but when we were there, to queue for a table, there was a tablet outside the restaurant. You basically key in your preference for sitting (e.g indoor, outdoor, bar) and number of pax, contact number. Once the table is available, they will give you a call. We were sitted at the bar counter, we didn't mind, as we can see how the bar staff prepare the drinks. We even got a complimentary shooter of strawberry milkshake ; ) We ordered the breakfast steak and the waffle. The breakfast steak was served with toast (came with an interesting strawberry flavoured butter), hash brown, side salad, bratwurst, and 2 sunny side up. The strawberry flavoured butter goes very well with the toast, giving it a sweet and savoury taste at the same time. The bratwurst was very nice, as the skin was very crunchy. As for the steak, it was very well seasoned and was not overcooked (although wait staff will not ask you for the doneness). The pairing of the steak and sunny side up was very fitting. As for the waffle, it was just the way we like it, crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The waffle is served with sides of peanut butter, Nutella, fruit compote, blueberry, and maple syrup. It is then top with their homemade vanilla ice cream with honeycomb and whip cream. The whole combination works very well and it worth every single calorie : )The complimentary strawberry milkshake that we tried was very good. We know, as we saw how it was made. They are very generous with the amount of ice cream the put in the milkshake. Noticed that chocolate and cookies & cream milkshake were quite popular. My sis ordered a hot latte and it was served with a cute ginger flavoured biscuit (the biscuit was shape as a gingerbread man, how cute : ) )Prices are reasonable (the breakfast steak was less than SGD30). Environment wise, the interior is very cozy and quirky. Many trinkets are place around the restaurant. There is outdoor sitting of long tables with benches, well shaded, perfect for outdoor dining. Wait staff is also very friendly, and service was efficient

you can make reservation in here as the place is quite small so you will need to wait for a while during peak hour in weekend (brunch and lunch time) . in my opinion, its just okay and its not in my list for best brunch in singapore. i will prefer to go back to wild honey or open door policy for similar pricing but better quality for food.

We (four Kiwis) were in need of a yummy brunch after a big night. From the outside, this restaurant looks a little abandoned but inside .... wonderful ambience, friendly staff and as we were to find out, delicious food. Brunch unfortunately is only served during the weekend, but we were all able to find a lunch item to our liking. The coffee was really good and the food excellent, with some really creative extras that worked. Also really liked the quirkiness of the decor. Yum - thanks Symmetry

It was by word of mouth that we heard of Symmetry. Friends boasted of its amazing waffles and coffee..and it certainly did not disappoint. For a casual brunch place, the food is well presented and boasts of flavour and nuances of well-crafted skill befitting of quality contemporary gourmet cuisine. We had the rissoles, xmas lunch and waffles- all of which left us wanting more

My wife and I just had our anniversary meal here. Two drinks (nonalcoholic) and two mains was just over 100 Singaporean. That said, food and drinks were excellent and the decor eclectic.
5
So Tuesday night out and having to book? This place is very lively and busy in the Arab quarter area. The menu is really exciting and the presentation of the food was just excellent. A lot of care has been put into creating the right atmosphere to complement the type of food and people that it wants to draw in, this being more local than a typical expat place.The food was of god quality and they pulled off an excellent steak tartare. I will be back.If I have to say anything at all it was about 10% overpriced but it is worth checking this place out

Great place to hang out with friends. It's one of the most spacious cafe I have ever been. Be mindful to get a queue ticket. Nice cafe in Singapore always requires some waiting time. Went on a Saturday around 2+pm SGT and the waiting time was around 14-20min. Would recognize to take a walk around as there are also quite a number of attraction to see. The interior design of the cafe is cool, mixture of everything. Details attention seeker would find it thrilling.Food is quite nice, yet portion might be a bit small, and it's average cafe price. A plate of egg benedicts costs sgd22. Portion may not be as good as Lola's cafe. If you go for atmosphere and nice food, do consider this place. If considering a sumptuous dinner, Cafe is not always the right place to. A 10 minutes walk from Bugis mrt station

Love:1. Truffle fries - one of the better renditions of truffle fries around (although Au Chocolat is still my favourite), love the shaved cheese2. Eggs benedict - Symmetry's version comes with portbello mushrooms, although it could have been better if they had served it whole instead of mincing it3. Location - doesn't hurt that it's in Bugis area, where you can walk over to Kandahar St (Rich & Good Cake Shop for swissrolls), Liang Seah St (Ah Chew Desserts for traditional chinese desserts)Tip: Symmetry accepts reservations, do make one in advance, to avoid the queue

Was really taken by surprise that this place's so mad crowded. There were tables laid out in the open next to the shophouse unit , just a couple of metres from the main road to create extra capacity . My friend and I chose to wait for 10 mins or so for seats inside and gosh it was so crowded, noisy and kinda stuffy in there , everyone's chatting on the top of their voices. We waited for more than 30mins for our order and realized that they had missed out our order when the peeps who ordered after us were served . We were promptly served after our second reminder to them .The big breakfast's just like any other , have tasted better... But their waffles were amazing . If I would ever return again , it would probably be just for the waffles and definitely not for the ambience .By the way, the waffles were on the house - for missing our order. Hospitality +

Location - plenty of roadside parking and easy to get to via Bus or MRT.premise - located along the main road and has plenty of outdoor seating which are somewhat sheltered by huge trees outside and makes it look totally rustic. the inside of the cafe is quite nice in design with odd tables and chairs which are a mish-mash of designs.crowd - mainly couples and tonnes of friends. all there to enjoy a good Saturday tea / coffee session.service - crowded place but the people all had a smile on their faces!!food - the menu was sold out when we came and so we only had coffee and it was expensive in my books.verdict - bring your friends and chat you lives away and enjoy the relaxed feel of the place and the 'cool' factor

Quaint cafe with good service and vibrant atmosphere. The food is not that impressive, mediocre and I found it overpriced for a cafe. I had the duck confit risotto, portion of duck was smaller than what I expected & it had foie gras in the dish which the menu did not indicate. Just way too heavy in a single dish. My friends had the baby barramundi and again it was totally different from her visualisation. It came a whole fish which was unevenly fried with burnt marks and it had cubed potatoes covered with some sort of lobster bisque. The combination of the potato bisque thing was just very unflattering for the palate. The only main dish - beef, ordered by another friend came out decent though. Cocktails were rather lovely though.

Went to Symmetry for dinner on a Friday night based on numerous friends' recommendations. We didn't manage to get a reservation but lucky for us, there was only 2 of us and the bar seats were available. Staff were very friendly and gave good recommendations for drinks.I ordered a Symmetry special that comes in a pretty huge glass. I forgot the exact name but it's a refreshing drink with lychee, sprite, mint and lemon (S$14). This drink I felt, was a little pricey. I would order one to share with 2 the next time. My friend had a Flat White and they did a cute rabbit coffee art for her. It was also a nice touch to serve all the tables fresh seedless grapes on ice upon sitting down.We weren't that hungry so we ordered a Truffle Fries ($S15) and Tiger Prawn Aglio Olio to share. The Truffles Fries was one of the best I've eaten in Singapore. However, the pasta was a total letdown. Mediocre is an overstatement; it was in fact, terrible. The presentation was nothing special either. It costs close to S$30 for such a terrible pasta which was not worth it at all.All in all, I had a really good time there. The lights were pretty dim but the ambience was good. Service was excellent. I would go back there for drinks and snacks, but not the mains. Or maybe, I should try their brunch menu.Our total bill came up to S$75. Value wise, not so worth it I say

It was a lovely Sunday that wasn't too warm and the place was packed to their gills! But service was still very friendly and relatively quick and given the conditions, food was still punching above the bar...Nice vibe, nice ambience, good food, friendly service and great company...!!

These guys have a funky and delicious menu, and are making some outstanding coffee. They have scoured the world to source beans and equipment, and you'll love the vibe of this funky coffee shop. It's open for lunch and dinner too - and has free WiFi. It's between Lavender and Bugis.

We booked in advance, and we were glad that we did, as it got very busy. The food was excellent and, once we got over the confusion around our order (the waiter sorted the mix up very quickly and with no fuss), the food itself was delicious. There is a good variety of food and we all had something different and were all very happy.We didn't visit in the evening but it looks like it would be a great place to go for cocktails and beers
1
We went to have late breakfast and waited about 15 mons after registering at the ipad queue system they have in place. There's no consideration of people waiting, because the shop is busy. I didn't mind the bar counter but after all, we were give a seat facing the wall. the distance between the wall and the chair was about 50cm. You gotta be kidding. When i asked the guy if there's any other seat, in fact there were, but because i didn't mind bar counter, His answer was 'NO'. There are many places in the market for brunch... This will be the last option

We came here at the recommendation of a friend who is a coffee critic. However, I do not echo his rave review. My coffee was not as hot as I wanted it and it had a very pronounced acidic taste. It was still an OK cup, it was smooth and round in terms of flavor but the sour taste was difficult to ignore. Maybe it was a fluke as I've heard all rave reviews. I will try again, maybe the weekend brunch and we'll see. I had the roast beef sandwich and it was nice. I esp love the dressing
4
Symmetry is always packed!! No matter what time of the day during the weekend. This is my second time at Symmetry and the food is still good!!! We ordered truffle fries, eggs benedict and truffles scrambled eggs! All were very good! Wanted to try the burger but was not on the brunch menu!!The coffee was good as well, strong with no bitter taste! Certainly will come back soon

Kinda of a young vibrant cafe serving various types of brunch and lunch menus. Crowd kinda hip, and young. Being a young vibrant cafe, they try to use most social medias for reservations. Emailed them and yet somehow reservation was not recorded properly. As they appear to be rather busy especially over the weekends, they have timed seatings, in and out at a certain time. Table service wasn't fantastic as everyone appeared to be all over the place. Food took a while to arrive, wasn't sure if took much orders or kitchen was slow. Luckily food was rather nice, though portions were small.Will we be back? Not sure.E. abby@symmetry.com.sgW. http://symmetry.com.sgFB. facebook.com/symmetry.s

Managed to get a table quickly as we turned up quick early on a Sunday. There's a nice cheerful buzz to the place with a mixture of young local people, expats on their first Sunday brunch dates, oversized couples to have their big breakfasts and suburban families.The crew is helpful but needs more training. Food looked and sounded great but tasted average. Overall it's good, but there's lots of brunch options in Singapore now so not sure why so many still join the long queue.

I came in at 3pm with a reservation and the place was crowded. The crowd were young and hip I guess. We were greeted by this girl who was very pleasant and I must say charming who seated us at our table right away. Putting the great people of Symmetry asideâ€¦..The menu were sort of all over the place but we decided on 3 dishes which were the Crispy duck Egg, Pork collar Croissant, and the Waffle with ham and egg (can't remember the exact name)I guess the Pork Collar was the best out of the three. The sauce was nice and the pork slices were quite generous. The croissant was very disappointing as it was borderline hard and really yellow in color. I am not gonna make any comment on the two dish especially the Crispy duck egg.Its a great place to hang out with friends if you are still in your mid 20s and I must say that the hype is just a hype for this one

Ok I loved this place instantly. I now put this on my personal nr 1 spot. Food quality, staff, decor are all outstanding. Food. I've only sampled two but both were outstanding in terms of ingredients, seasoning and interesting combinations. The whole menu looks inspired with few dishes on there that are run of the mill. Staff. Omnipresent and very articulate. No nose ringed, ham fisted ignoramusses here. You'd never be waiting for more than a minute to get attention and that was sitting outside !Decor. Ok I'm a suckered for warehouse style and (thus) love the look of this place both in and outside. I also like what they've done to overcome their number 1 issue: their popularity ! Using an I pad you get an sms when your table is ready. No hanging around needed

After reading rave reviews on blogs and on other review sites, I went to Symmetry looking forward to a brunch that could compare with global standards. Unfortunately I was disappointed.Upon getting to Symmetry at around noon on Sunday, I was greeted by a screen that asked me for some details and then sent me an SMS saying that there were 10 tables in front of me. I took this opportunity to walk around the neighborhood. Good decision to use the automated queuing technology. About 30-45 minutes later upon being seated I tried a few different dishes:Symmetry Eggs Sur Le Plat: Best described as sunny side up eggs atop cutup sausage in a slightly spicy brown bean-like sauce with cheese, served with a thick slide of low-density bread. Taste was good, price of $22 felt expensive.Eggs Benedict: Typical poached eggs atop an open faced English muffin with aged cheddar and bacon. Claims of having hollandaise sauce but that delicious ingredient didn't come out to me. Taste was okay, price of $20 was expensive. The best part of the dish was the golden crispy hash brown that came with it.Berries Smoothie: A nice but diluted taste, maybe too much water, maybe the strawberry yogurt used was not thick enough... for $10 I was disappointed.Total bill of $61 for two people (no coffee). Service here is very attentive, always around. The ambiance is nice, tables spacious and chairs are comfortable. Location is convenient and relatively central. Food aside, this is a nice place.The search for a world-class brunch spot continues..

Its a tat pricey but the food portions are big n its a hearty bite for sure. Great vintage decor n bar but it can feel a little dusty n murky if u know what i mean. Dessert range is rather small n the mains stop at 2pm which sucks for those who want to have a late lunch. Oh, they got no decaf coffee so this place is not one for nursing moms
