I only ate the once here but thoroughly enjoyed the food.
I just had a basic Thai fried rice which was excellent.

The food is delicious, suits with the picture of the food which is displayed. Try the pork kailan rice, pineapple fried rice.

This is a terriffic place to eat, lots of options and very very reasonable prices. Lovely and clean and the vendors were very helpful. We couldn't choose a favourite dish as we loved everything there - but have to say the Chicken wings were awesome !!

This is in what locals call a coffee shop. It is like a hawker centre but smaller (and cleaner). This is NOT fine dining. However... we have been to this little family Thai shop many times. We just love it - cheap and delicious - and totally authentic. Grab a beer from the coffee shop and go to Muay Thai and grab some Pork Larb, the whole Sea Bass and some spicy squid. The shop owner is a delightful lady and the whole family pitch in to help! If you don't like spicy food - you should choose carefully :
