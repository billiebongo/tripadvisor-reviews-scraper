The 12.80 set lunch is pretty awesome and it does get crowded even for weekday lunches. Service is excellent despite that. The young waitress were attentive and refilled my glass continuously. Food was good too. Highly recommend montana
4
The food was alright, staff was very friendly. Such a bumper that the pineapple flavoured cider was out. Just maybe they should replished more of their unique ciders.
4
Waffles are good. Fragrant and not too greasy kind. Ordered signature mac and cheese savoury waffle. Service is ok.
2
Foods that we ordered was below expectation. We ordered savory waffles stuffed with fried chicken & Chili crab burger, both doesn‚Äôt have the special or wow taste. Quite disappointed.
4
With the price, I found the portion is slightly smaller compared to the usual Cafe. However no doubt the pork rib was pretty good!
5
Walked by for dinner and the prices here are really very good. Had the mac and cheese burger and fried chicken waffles and both were super. I've been here for lunch and it's busier, so I recommend to come for dinner with friends.
5
The dishes were served promptly, the coconut infused cold brew coffee was my favorite. They had given us a super huge table for six of us + 2 toddlers.
4
I've read many reviews and ranged from 3-5 stars....So Had to go for myself and see what it's all about. The menu looked very enticing!They have a mix of crazy cake combinations that look to die for, beer/wine, coffee/tea (known for their coconut cold brew), desserts, Burgers, salads, savory/sweet waffle combinations.¬†Since I came here specifically for the 'waffles'....I decided from all the reviews to give my "first shot" to the Mac n Cheese Waffle. I must say, waffles have always been my all-time favorite breakfast item. This was absolutely to die for. It had this gooey-ness from the cheese/pasta in the waffle batter. The only thing I'd say is the dipping salsa sauce was too sweet. Either a tangy-er version or ketchup would've been better. I did give the Coconut cold brewed chocolate was quite a very unique and different taste. I drink coconut water almost daily. Loved how it comes in a scientist beaker with a very cool shot-like glass to drink from served on a marble tray to stay cool.¬†The staff were ALL very friendly.¬†I'm definitely returning and trying other dishes! Gotta give this place a try
3
We had the Mac and cheese burger and the ribs and while the Mac and cheese burger was something different, I think the Mac and cheese fritters alone may have been better as it kinda masked the taste of the beef patty. Also, do NOT try their coconut chocolate drink, tasted really bad, like how you‚Äôd expect sewage to taste.
5
Nice cafe design, with good dessert. Red Velvet waffles was special and one of the best waffles I've had, the chilli crab burger is the first time I had it, very interesting and tasty. Also order the salted egg yolk pasta which is creamy and lots of flavour. Very good experience, I will come back next time I'm in Singapore
4
nice place to have gatherings. decent food. decent prices. cold brewed chocolate wasn't what I expected but it's worth trying!
4
6th time here and trying the pasta instead of their waffles. Set lunch for $13.80++ was not bad and the deco inside was really pretty üòç Pasta was average but will be back to try their weekend brunch soon~
3
Food was average but place looks cozy for group gathering. Mainly more on burgers though. Overall, not that bad but won't really go back again unless for group gatherings.
3
Heard a lot about their fried chicken waffle. Went there to try - waffle is fluffy but soggy at the bottom.
Fried chicken is not crispy and skin is too oily. Flavor is not there. I've had better so I won't return to Montana again.
5
Came here with little expectations initially, but I was pleasantly surprised by how yummy the food is, and how attentive the service staff were. The chilli crab burger and the sweet waffles were one of the best I've had in SG. Keep it up guys!
5
Atmosphere was good, service great, music wonderful, food was excellence. The only thing that disappoint was the signature mac & cheese waffle. Can give it a pass.
4
tired the waffle rosti, dissapointing, not as good as expected.
However, mac and cheese waffle is very good. Friend ordered mint chocolate drink which is suprisingly rich and good, initially thought it was a tea
5
Service was prompt as restaurant was only 20% occupied.
Food was great. Best waffles I had. Definitely will return for more waffles.
If only they have all-time traditionals like waffles with chocolate ice cream.
4
The kimchi burger at a fair price (around $12.80) was really worth it, and the coconut cold brew coffee ($6.80) was absolutely divine. Although the tables are placed close together, it's a comfortable place for a good catch-up or a casual gathering. The staff were attentive and efficient, helping us to move from the corner of the restaurant to a bigger table.
4
Our party of 5 had lunch here, I‚Äôve seen lots of social media posts on Montana and finally managed to try it. Their waffles are light and yet crunchy, we tried the southern fried chicken waffle and the chocolate and banana waffle. Both were good but they could have given some maple syrup or honey on the side, which they didn‚Äôt. Prices are slightly on the high side for cafe grub, set lunch with just a pasta and drink goes for $13+ which is a little expensive. If you‚Äôre using a chope pre bought voucher like I did, do note that you can‚Äôt order from the set lunch menu.
5
Nice ambiance nice food and nice coffee. Enjoy the quiet afternoon over here, will definitely return again.
1
Had to hunt someone down for everything I needed and food did not seem freshly prepared. Was disappointed overall.
Don‚Äôt typically post negative remarks but felt it necessary here when prompted. Think you guys can do better.
4
came for dinner on a weekday and it wasn't very crowded. portion can be slightly bigger but the overall atmosphere was great
4
service staff gave us a table that is not cleared yet. food took a bit long to arrive, but it was yummy. Ambience quite chill.
4
Cosy cafe with a nice ambience. Ordered the truffle benedict and banana chocolate waffle to share with a friend...portions were just right. The coconut cold brew dink was interesting but not to my taste.
4
I usually don't like cold brew because of its sourness. Their coconut cold brew has none of that. It was smooth and pleasant. Would visit again just for the cold brew ;-)
4
Food was really nice although we wished that the portion were more substantial. It was probably just nice for non-hungry ladies. Cafe decor and interior was really cozy and good for photos. Lightings were excellent too and the lady who served us was really pleasant.
4
We had a birthday celebration dinner for our friend. Must try their baked salmon, red velvet ice cream waffles dessert and their signature gula melaka ice coffee!
4
I came on the evening and had a main meal and a drink. The food and drink were both good at an ok price for Singapore. The staff were friendly. The restaurant is stylish and comfortable inside. One side is open into a mall, so it didn't have a cosy feeling but there are seating places tucked away from the main open space of you want somewhere quieter. It was pretty quiet when I was there and I was going to try a waffle after my meal but they stopped serving food earlier than expected (before 9pm) so I didn't get the chance.
1
We arrived at 640pm for a 7pm reservation, preordered a freak cake for a birthday surprise for our friend and the staff even confirm that it was a surprise and no of candles needed. By 7pm we have made our orders and specified to serve immediately. To our dismay by 740pm nothing was served (3 mains 2 sides) and we enquired about the order only to find out that there was a "technical glitch" and our orders were not captured. For a restaurant with less than 40% full, we really felt that the staff could have been more observant and noticed our lack of orders. Dinner was okay, nothing to rave, and we kept trying to catch the attention of the waitress to serve the surprise. To our surprise, the same waitress brought our bill instead and we had to blurt out that they forgot the cake, and spoilt the whole surprise. We really felt quite unhappy having to fork out the 10% service charge when there was no service at al
4
Really good ambience. Amazing food. Love the service. Love everything about this place! Really loved the red velvet waffles - comes with icecream that has shortbreads and a slight lychee flavouring. It tasted like magic.
5
The sesame waffle was amazing! Flavourful, fluffy, and still crispy topped off with a generous scoop of ice cream.
Southern fried chicken was good, but not as outstanding as waffles.
Excellent service and atmosphere.
4
love the food here and nice place to chill with friends. convenient location. visited a few times! will come back again
3
Overall experience was alright. Was told they were in the midst of updating their menu so they took off pasta and bugers... We could only order a savory waffle, a set dinner and sweet waffle.
Would consider dining there again if they expanded their menu.
3
Waffles were nice but the food was bad. Chicken confit was undercooked. Raw/pink in the middle. Coffee was bad. Service was minimal...not attentive at all even though the place was not even crowded. Would not return.
3
My mom order a dish "Salted Salmon with rice" is very salty. For me, I ordered ‚Ä¢"Daddy Chesse Buger" the taste is ok.
2
Food wasn't great; is more of the ambient. Don't think I will visit again, but if you are looking out for something different, maybe this is the right place.
2
The restaurant has variety of food but there was only pork and chicken dishes left for order when we arrived on saturday morning. We can only select 2 or 3 items out from the menu while the rest are not available. Whats the point of opening a restaurant when they can only serve less han half of the menu items to their guest? The waitress coukd have just told us upfront before we are ready to order
3
Went there during a Saturday night for dinner. Had Bronx burger which wasn't too bad. However the waiting time was far too long (waited for 45-1hour). Had to check in with the waiters numerous times before food is served. Wouldn't recommend this place if you're hungry or have an appointment to catch next.
3
Came here for breakfast/brunch, only to be told we couldn't order the big breakfast because they didn't have it. I ended up going with a dessert waffle in red velvet, because I couldn't get the one I wanted originally. I couldn't taste any red velvet in it (which is probably a good thing if you don't really like red velvet), and despite being the only people who needed food, it took a little while to come out. My coffee was nice, but the cup was very small, I finished it in about three mouthfuls. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, and his milkshake was, more like a thickshake. Probably won't come back agai
3
The idea of Asian-inspired savory waffles is solid, but service and flavors not quite a hit everytime.
4
My first time there, the impression is good, service is warm, the place is quite quiet, I will come back one day.
4
We were placed at a table quickly and the food was served promptly after order. Food was good and service was quick as well.
4
Totally love their infusion tea. Used heated coconut water go thru cocoa to give strong chocolate flavour! Must try
5
Staff were very nice although from 4 oersons, we ended up with 3 pax and only one was eating. Really thankful for their attentiveness and food is great as per usual. They have waffles available or you can healthier choices like quinoa. Very affordable too!

Can't say I was blown away with the food here, despite all the good reviews out there. 1. Regular Coconut Cold BrewMy partner enjoyed this but just tasted like cold coffee to me. 2. Crab Cakes BenedictThis was a disaster. The crab cakes were thin 1/2 inch discs, resembling pancakes, and had an odd taste. The poached eggs were undercooked, so when cut into, the whites dissolved into a watery mess on the already soggy crabcake. On top of that, the yuzu hollandaise was thin and runny. So the overall effect was a soggy muffin mess with odd tasting crab. Definitely not worth the $18.50.3. Big BreakfastThis was decent, but nothing to rave about. 4. Southern Fried Chicken WaffleAnother average item. Taste was alright, chicken was tender, but waffle was soggy.5. Signature Mac and Cheese WaffleDespite waiting over half an hour for this, they must have forgotten to put the mac n cheese in mine, coz I couldn't see or taste any of it. I did taste truffle oil though, and the waffle was crisp. 6. Crab Aglio OlioThis would have been alot more enjoyable without so much chili. Pity they don't do a non-spicy version. Although there were big chunks of crab meat, the pasta could have done with more crab flavour.7. Mushroom pate Nice mushroom flavour, a decent amount of pate with good toast to go with. 8. HummusDon't bother. The hummus itself had hardly any flavor. All you could taste was the smoked paprika oil.For a place that prides itself on waffles, I wouldn't say I was impressed. The wait time for waffle dishes is long. Hence, I suspect they turn up the heat to cook the waffles to make it crisp, but that resulted in the middle not cooked enough and ending up stodgy. 
3
The cafe has a nice ambience and deco. However, the food did not taste as good as the reviews. Tried the famous mac and cheese waffle. Waffle was too dry, not "crispy on outside and soft on inside" as described. Quite disapponting as the waffles are supposed to be their speciality. The cold brew tasted rather bland..could not quite taste the coconut in the sphere. I probably would be back to try other non-waffle dishes. Prices are too high for the standard of the food
4
Various interesting options for waffles matching; bulgogi beef was impressive and appetising, chicken confit was good on its own but there's no gelling with the waffles. Red velvet had good sucrocity but the sheer size meant 2 pax to 1 sweet waffles will be recommended.Burgers are par for the course in terms of taste, same for the desserts, though the size of desserts are not to be messed with. Takes 2 for each dessert, preferably.Being close by to 2 arts colleges and entertainment stretch means this place is mostly overrun with the younger and the hipster crowd. Thus, plan the visit if quieter moments are preferred as the spacing of tables are really tight
3
Place was good and menu looked promising but for the most part disappointing. The mac and cheese waffles was dry and uninspiring, the butter cream cake was pricy but again didn't deliver on taste aspect, truffle fries was bland. The Miso Brown Butter linguine was decent but nothing spectacular.
4
Braised Beef Cheek with Carrot Kimchi ($20.80+)I didn't care much for the carrot kimchi, it's nothing special to me. The beef cheeks were perfectly tender & delicious. Comes with two slices of toast that you can dunk into the sauce to slurp it all up. Would order this again!Big Breakfast ($18.00+)I enquired if I could swap the bacon out for something else (since I don't eat bacon), & they were kind enough to accommodate-- swap it out for an extra scrambled egg. This would've been wonderful if not for the fact that they forgot about my special order, served it with bacon, & I had to wait 15 minutes for a new platter to be cooked.All turned out well, though, & I didn't mind because my dining partner & I could tuck into the Braised Beef Cheek together since it was served first (sharing is caring). I appreciate the flexibility to swap ingredients out.The sausage was sizeable, not the pathetic lame hotdogs that some places serve. The default Miso ginger mushrooms were quite weird, so go for the other option (sauteed mushrooms with salt & pepper) if possible. Arugula salad was fresh & the vinaigrette had a good balance of sweetness with the acidity & tangyness of the vinegar.Coconut Cold Brew ($6.80+)Can I say WOW. A surprisingly good & balanced blend of coconut with cold brew. My partner found the coconut taste too strong (he's quite the traditionalist), but I loved it. It wasn't too sweet or bitter. The coconut ice sphere makes sure that the flavours are not diluted as your meal goes by. The last sip was as good as the first. You've got to try this for yourself.Ps: Eatigo discount is not valid for drinks, but this is still well worth it. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats only Accepts reservations - I used Eatigo (20% off!) No GS
5
Love the atmosphere, food is great! Desserts are great too and the cake is so pretty! Price is reasonable for the quality and atmosphere.
4
Love the texture of the waffle - fluffy and crispy at the same time. The ice cream that comes with it is so delicious.
4
All food and drinks are good except one dish, korean beef bulgogi waffle - it tasted horrible because it is nothing similar to korean beef bulgogi. It tasted so sour and spicy.
The waiters/waitresses were somewhat scattered around but still their service were okay.
5
always a pleasant experience at montana because their waffles are always on point whether crispy or fluffy!
3
Their waffles is quite good. I don't recommend their mains as I find it normal and below average. Coffee is average. Good for some dessert fix.
4
I think service needs improvement- it's a bit of a shame that with food that is so nice, service is only subpar.
3
not asking for the crab to be freshly picked from the shell but the crabmeat used in the linguine could be fresher. that said, the pasta was cooked al dente and the breadcrumbs provided good textural contrast. probably won't go back again though.
4
I've heard that the coffee brew is well known here, but I didn't know that the waffles here are famous too! And indeed they live up to their name. I tried the chocolate banana waffles and will come back again to try the red velvet and black sesame waffles!
4
Went only because the cakes look interesting, but end up eating a savory waffle of Mac and Cheese. Yup, Mac and Cheese added to waffle mix and baked to a crispy perfection. The only reason why I didn't enjoy my afternoon tea was the double espresso tasted a bit too sour for my liking
4
Comfort food. Palatable wines. Delicious coffee. A wide range of food that's suitable for all kind of eaters. Service quality can be more consistent. Third visit this week, and food has been really satisfying. Thursnight's service was beyond excellent, learnt new stuff about them and from them. Palate profiling is their strength, unique and different from the other cafes and wine bars. (Suggestion: Order wines! NATURAL WINES - very interesting and unique experience and if you don't drink wines, get their filter coffee or filter chocolate)
3
We had a southern fried chicken burger and red velvet waffles. Although the food was nothing to shout about for its pretty steep prices, the laidback atmosphere certainly made up for it. Great place for a catch up session with your old pals!
5
Ambience was superb with great food selections. Love the mac and cheese burger and their red velvet waffles
4
Liked the good service and food is nice. Though the freak cakes are a tad too sweet. But they are too beautiful to resist!
5
always a good time over here at montana. had the chocolate banana waffles which was great. would have been better w more ice cream!
4
The place is nice and cosy! Celebrated 3 of my friends birthday there, the service crew were really helpful in serving the 3 cakes as a surprise!
5
We got vouchers for Christmas from my baby sister; she picked this place based off the coffee and the reviews on their waffles!!
My fianc√©e has decided its one of her favourite brunch places now. (and that's a big thing for a foodie like her)
3
Place is easy to find. Requested for a quiet corner, but was place in front of the service bar. So a bit noisy. Food was ok. Dessert was excellent. Love caramel cake.
4
Great Food, I loved the unusual "Coconut water" coffee and the wonderfully fluff waffles. Great Job!!
5
Attentive wait staff, despite being hammered with customers at a point in time, observed that most customers had a enjoyable experience. I for one are more than satisfied. must try:Assam crab waffleCrab linguine(The crab meat lumps used is very juicy and fresh, tried it on both visits and quality was really good on both days)macdaddycoconut cold brew natural wines(They recommend based on ones palate profile, very interesting.)Espresso / latte(head barista is knowledgeable and can tweak the calibration to make it more suitable for your palate)will def be back agai
3
Coffee is good as it was, comparing when it had a smaller shopfront at level one. The food for the price paid is rather disappointing.
4
We ordered the chicken waffles and truffle egg waffles. The chicken itself was tasty but the waffles could be better if it wasnt just plain waffles. Truffle eggs had enough truffles taste to it. Good experience!
3
food was good but the portion was quite little.
we wanted to sit at the back but heard it was reserved for the people who order drinks.
3
chicken was nice. however, the waffles in general were ordinary and nothing spectacular. service standards were commendable.
4
Tried the pasta which was abit to little but it definitely made up with the very visually appealing Nutella cake
4
Creative mix of flavors that works! Serving portion was just right and everythis was made fresh! Really good experience
4
Ambience was really good for a gathering with friends. Not too noisy. Food was really good, especially the wagyu rice bowl - definitely worth the wait!
4
Service was excellent but definitely not the food. Cakes look spectacular but taste average. Waffles were soft. Was hoping it to be crispy but soft on the insides.
4
Burgers were juicy. Waffles were however disappointing and got soggy quickly. But service was prompt
5
We ordered the beef cheek with carrot kimchi and the beef was really very tender and delicious! The kimchi also had an interesting spin to it and the dish came together very well. The crispy chocolate banana waffle and matcha sesame freak cake was DIVINE and an absolute must-have!
4
A great place to hang out and catch up with loved ones. Good music selection, beautiful menuzine that makes you want to order a lot of items! Mac&cheese balls are a must order. Coffee was fragrant and smooth. Service was attentive - our water glasses were constantly refilled without us requesting. Will return
5
really love the ambience and waffles here. great service and great location. will definitely visit again
5
4th time here and the waffles are still one of the best I've ever eaten. Friendly staff and nice atmosphere as well! Will come back to try more waffles!!
4
Must try their signature cheese waffle with truffle oil and the coconut cold brewed coffee!
I love them and highly recommend them to you too.
The sweet waffles and the other coffee are nice too!
5
I will highly recommend the mac and cheese fritters and the miso brown butter sauce linguine!! Will be back to try other dishes!
3
Food were over price. There are more cafe to try out and unlikey to return again.
Desert was not bad.
5
Patronized this place on a Sunday afternoon with friends. It turned out to be in a very quiet mall, and business seemed brisk.But it was a good thing for my friends and I as well, because then we could just enjoy our time there chatting and catching up. The place is pretty big and spacious, with some nice seats. Unfortunately when we arrived in the middle of a typically-hot afternoon, one of their aircons was leaking, which meant they had to turn it off, and that resulted in the inner part of the place being rather warm and stuffy. They did try to switch on the fans to help with the ventilation, but it took a long time before any of us cooled down some, having come from the brutal heat outside.Food-wise, we tried their waffles, which they're apparently famous for. It was all great. I personally had the Beef Bulgogi Waffles, and shared the Red Velvet Waffle with a friend, and I especially loved the Red Velvet. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft inside. The strawberry shortcake ice cream was a little too sweet, but I'm one of those who don't like overly-sweet food, so it could be just me. As for the Beef Bulgogi, the beef was done to near perfectness too. Slices of adequate size, and very tender and flavourful. I would absolutely come back; in fact I definitely WANT to come back, because there are still other choices of waffles in their menu which I really want to try
5
Convenient location near SOTA,Dhoby Ghaut. My Friend and I ordered southern fried chicken sandwich and dessert is the famous red velvet waffle. The food is delicious. The chicken is crispy and full of the buttermilk taste is just too perfect to eat together with the cheesy taste waffle. Not forget about the dessert, the waffle which topped up with strawberry ice cream and white chocolate rose syrup is just too nice! Furthermore,the environment is very relaxing and the staffs are polite. We really have a good time here:
4
This is a cosy place with nostalgic deco. We arrived earlier than our reservation but the crew gladly showed us to our table. The crew was friendly too, always with a smile. We ordered the crabmeat linguine, fried chicken waffle and mac&cheese waffle plus red velvet wafer as desert. The linguine and sauce in fried chicken waffle was a litttle too spicy but overall, the taste was good. Love the mac&cheese waffle, not too overwhelming as we worried. The dessert was a great way to end the meal.
5
We went during lunchtime and they had a lunch set promotion of $12.80++ for a selected number of options on the menu, such as the mac and cheese waffles, chicken thigh waffles, bronx burger, pastas etc. It was very value for money considering you get a good portion of food with a drink as well! The food was good, everything that we tried was palatable to the senses and a joy to eat. Service was prompt and staff were jovial, apart from the fact that they kept refilling other tables' cups of water but seemed to forget about us minor issue, nothing to complain about really. Loved this place and will definitely be back again to try out the rest of the menu (: thanks for the awesome experience!
3
After reading the rave reviews, my expectations were high...so after trying the Mac n cheese fritters, my party was excited that we found a good makan place! The mains and desserts that followed were let downs...the southern chicken waffle was average. Waffle on the soft side, not crisp, and chicken had too much batter. The pull-pork burger should be pulled from the menu. The pork is tough and dry and the dressing don't sit well with the overall taste.The coconut cold brew coffee...didn't take to it, but the subsequent sip was good. The fresh fruit juice is truly fresh!The bill came up to a $100, and with the chope vouchers....we saved a cool $10
5
We ordered the chocolate grilled banana waffles (fluffy) and it far exceeded expectations! Easily one of the best waffles in Singapore. The chai latte is also very good and certainly a must try for any chai lovers.
5
First time seeing black velvet waffles and it is my gf's favourite black sesame!! Complete with black sesame miso caramel sauce and green tea icecream.
5
Great Coffee, Great Music, Great Environment. Always my favourite local coffee hangout :) Hope they bring back the loyalty card soon though!
4
Ordered chicken waffle, pesto chicken pasta with chai latte and hot chocolate to go along. The waffle was buttery and soft. The chicken was crispy and subtly seasoned. The waffle would have tasted better if they had used a flavoured mayo instead of the regular one. The chai latte was one of the best out there. The hot chocolate was thick and creamy. Overall, it is a good cafe serving decent waffles and drinks at a reasonable price
4
Popped in for brunch after passing the sign outside a number of times, and I'm glad we did. The black sesame waffles (crispy style) with black sesame icecream were seriously one of the best things we ate the whole time we were in Singapore (which is saying something in a city with so much great food). The combinations of textures, the flavours, the restrained sweetness ... it was perfection. The rest of our meal was fine and the cold brew coconut coffee was interesting, but those waffles ..
4
I have been walking past the Pomo Mall for the past year - in particular walking past the poster of a juicy delectable (almost irresistible) burger, Bronx Burger... Well... I had some time last week and decided to walk in. Guess what?! The ground floor is NOT the restaurant - it's on the 2nd level! Aiyah!So I went to the 2nd floor - it was about 5pm, no crowd and seated myself. Looked at the menu and ordered the Bronx Burger with triple fries... supposed to come with a soft drink, which I didn't want. The waitress was prompt and efficient - she offered a coffee at the end of the meal. OK, why not?!The Bronx Burger came - looked nice: charred on the outside, medium on the inside, with a crispy bacon, lettuce and gerkin. Bun was warm and lightly toasted. The triple fries were good! The meat patty was not some slab of frozen protein thing - it was definitely not some central kitchen produce!After my meal, and without prompting, my coffee came.Total bill was less than $20.Nice music and ambience too! Plus very decent service
4
Ordered a Gula Melaka coconut cold brew, black velvet waffles and chocolate waffles. Cold brew tastes interesting with coconut added into it. Gula Melaka adds a tinge of sweetness to the coffee. Hazelnut ice cream tastes excellent. Waffles is so-so. Green tea ice cream was on the black velvet waffles. Authentic taste. A little bitter in taste. For someone who's looking for a simple taste.
3
We tried out Montana having heard about their waffles.The restaurant was easy to find though getting to it following their sign was not as direct as going up the main escalator.The service was prompt and friendly. We were seated quickly and our questions were answered with detail.We tried the red velvet waffle which was presented well and tasted very good. The rose syrup was very flavorful without being overpowering.We also tried the Chocolate Banana waffle which unfortunately was god awful. It actually tasted like there was some old meat within it.I tried out their coconut cold brew coffee and it wasn't my cup of coffee.The banana waffle experience really put us off and we won't visit again
4
I came by on a Monday evening in dire need of food and coffee. Seems like the place has relocated to the 2nd floor of POMO because it took me a while to find it. I had the flat white, and the jalape√É¬±o mac and cheese waffle. The coffee while decent, was slightly more acidic than I preferred. So that was a little disappointing. The waffle's texture was great and there were even bits of macaroni! What would have made it perfect would be if it was oozing cheese instead of a sprinkle on the waffle. I would recommend visiting for the waffles. Shout out to the waitress who came by to ask for feedback before I left. I paid 23 bucks for my meal.
5
I was walking around Pomo area wondering what to eat for dinner then I saw a signboard that says there is a restaurant on the 2nd floor. We walked into an almost full place with a nice atmosphere and cheerful staff. The place looks expensive but the menu showed a different thing. Lucky that there is no queue. We ordered pesto chicken pasta and spicy bacon pasta. Both very nice! Went online to check out their reviews, ordered the chocolate banana waffle for desert, fantastic!!!!!!!!
