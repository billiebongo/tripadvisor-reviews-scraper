As my family and I were craving for Spicy Miso Ramen which we had in Japan last month, we were all so happy to have found a spicy miso ramen near home!! Nice fat, juicy salmon. Not oily, superb spicy miso ramen!! Yummy yum yum!!

We was in a rush and had only 20 minutes for dinner before our movie. We ordered rice with salmon and made a special request to serve as quickly as they can. The waiter was very helpful and indeed we managed to complete our dinner within the time constraint. The food was good and the staff were friendly. This restaurant is highly recommended and we will surely come again

When entering the restaurant, the manager and the service staff welcomed us warmly and immediately attended to us. Our orders were served promptly. The dishes really tasted authentic. The miso soup was very delicious and so were all of the other dishes we enjoyed. For the children it was a great experience to sit next to the balustrade and to watch the ice skating which is located at level 3. The whole team was very attentive and overall friendly at any time.The restaurant includes a small Marketplace where you can purchase some Japanese grocery products. Our family is looking forward to another great dining experience at Isuramuya
