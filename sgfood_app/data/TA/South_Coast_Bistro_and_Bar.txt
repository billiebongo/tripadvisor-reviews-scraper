Really good French Food, and wine. Wait staff was very friendly, we liked the light dishes and the good selection of wine, perfect for late night snack. with a great view of the bay and the night life coming alive on the bay front.

This was the most beautifulFrench restaurant I have ever experienced. The food was out of this world!!!!!

We're here waiting for the night sparkling light. Here serving great foods with good working attitude and won't bother you.

Generous portions of salmon for both rosti and eggs benedict ordered. Good service with a smile! Recommended!

Nice little stop for a snack and a drink on a hot Sunday afternoon. We sat outside as had our dog with us but was nicely shaded which is rare for that area.

Excellent location with lots of nice tables inside / outside . Nice menu with different types of food . The service is definitely the best part of this bar . Everyone is lovely !

We went to watch a show at the Mastercard theatre and afterwards for ease thought we'd try south coast at MBS. I wish i'd bought a hot dog at the show. Now one thing that really perplexes and frustrates me about Singapore or chefs in general (i used to be one so I speak with authority) is the need for them to feel that a plain dish needs something fancy of their own on. If I ask for plain I expect plain. I have 2 very fussy children and I asked for 3 very plain steaks (2 for the kids & 1 for me) the chef thought it his duty to stick some form of putrid herb mixture over the steak which instantly put off my children. Dont mess with good ingredients and dont feel that you know best. Listen to the customer. The steak itself was tender and well cooked (so the dog told me as the kids never ate it) Just do what your asked. My wife had the Linguini, the last time i saw something like that was at 2.30 am outside a nightclub where they were serving 2 for 1 drinks all night. Needless to say, I will not go back there. typically with a bottle of wine the bill came to just shy of $300 and all i can say is thank god for the entertainer App which allowed us to knock $80 of this dreadful experience. There are much better places for much better value

Have been here a few times and the food has never disappointed. They do great bar food plus pizzas and it's all delicious. The wine list is pretty good too and the service is friendly and efficient. It's great to sit outside and even when you're inside, the open plan makes it feels large and spacious

When I'm in Singapore I always make my way down to South Coast. I have never had a bad evening here. It is in a great location right on the harbour front at Marina Bay with fantastic views across the bay to the city.All the staff are very friendly and the service is excellent. Always good to relax with a cold beer and meet new people ay South Coast. Eddie the Manager is a great guy and will ensure your evening is memorable. They also play live sport on the monitors. I have no hesitation in recommending South Coast for a meal or and few cold beers

A very busy Saturday night and they managed to seat us outside and service was prompt. Pizza was very tasty, not particularly authentic but a very nice meal. Chicken parmigiana was delicious. Chocolate fondant dessert one of the best I've had, although took a while to come. 2 courses 85s$.
5
From the food to the gorgeous atmosphere.... Top notch. Relaxed vibe at the fancy Marina Bay Sands. Affordable and delicious. Glamour without the drama. Directly across from the famous Louis Vuitton and water show. Location. Location. Location.
4
Went here for dinner recently, great vibe for afternoon/night drinks and share plates. The owner is super friendly and welcoming! Amazing views of the Marina Bay!
4
Outstanding view of the marina, somewhat inhibited by the massive obstruction of the Louis Vuitton shop. Great wine selection!
4
Good menu choice and quality of food was okay. Location was good. Staff are a little bit too relaxed though.
2
No air conditioning inside and hot and humid outside. Just average service at high prices.
The only beer available was Victorian Bitter at $16 ++ for a glass.
Not the place for a relaxing cool drink
1
Don't get me wrong, the kitchen and the chef are fantastic and the food is to die for.... Too bad it is let down by the worst customer service in Singapore. Waiters disappear for upwards of 20 minutes. After finishing our dishes it took us 19 minutes to attract the attention of any of the wait staff who we both made eye contact with upwards of 6 times each but he continues to stand there.We asked to get the wine and food menus again so we could order another bottle of wine and some cheeses, if they had come back within the next 15 minutes we would have happily ordered some. When they finally bothered to come over much later (and it was the bartender of all people - assumedly the wait staff were too busy tending to their nearly empty restraunt) we just got the bill and left immediately.Great food but the front of house people are letting it down incredibly and making it too hard too get it. I really do feel sorry for this exceptional chef.I have had this discussion at length with the waiter at fault and in his defence he has apologised but that's it, as far as I am concerned it's too little too late and I can't recommend you go there

I had company gathering at this place, where our director highly recommend this. The food is good but not sure if the day we went is a hot day, the bar itself is very humid without much air. It only getting better after late night when I can start feeling the cool air. I did not have any alcohol drink. i tried the steak and it is nice. My friend who had the chicken said it is average, so it really depends on what kind of dishes you ordered. The mini burger is good too

Brian the owner is a real old school Australian host - tall stories, relaxed attitude and he makes you feel welcome. The steak was great too - just steak, with herb butter, chips and an IPA in the sun. There were four of us chatting and watching the world go by. Lovely. However. It was a big shame about the, presumably, bar manager. What a contract to Brian - he was surly, inattentive, totally unproactive and had a "I'm really pissed off" facial expression. You had to ask for everything such as "please can you clean the table" or please can I have a menu (what did he think we were there for?), and "please can you remove my plate as we've finished". He might have had a bad day but be a pro and don't take it out on your customers.If it was not for the charm of Brian and the tasty steak I would have given this a 2 stars. If it was not for the manager, I would have given four stars

Come here regularly and their house made GF bread is a highlight. They don't always have it so make sure you ask or you will be very disappointed with the store bought substitute. Had it today with chorizo for breakfast and it was a great way to start the day. Day time weekend service is good- nighttime not so much. They will do a burger for you with the bread- make sure to ask for it toasted. They cut it pretty thick so be prepared to dislocate your jaw. The young guy behind the bar seems to effortlessly crank everything out even when busy
4
We chose to go to South Coast after a day of wandering around the Bay Gardens. As it was the evening it was cooler so the lack of air con didn't make any difference to us.From reading the other reviews I can agree that the service is woefully slow but, as long as you're chilled, the wait is worth it.We decided to have 2 different pizzas between us and both were light and delicious
5
Manager Mr.Edi being extraordinary, by delivering best service ......, they do have best drink and food. Must visit and highly recommended....
1
If you want to stand up and find the food server every time you need something then by all means you should eat here... Service was the absolute worst. I can't believe they stay in business... Avoid this place.
5
A great experience to eat good western food with view on the Marina Bay laser show for a normal price. The service for 28 people was also great.
2
This place came recommended. Well the service is bordering on non existent, food and drinks are overpriced although the quality is good.
There are much better Resturant's close by that I would visit before venturing back to South Coast.
2
Having been here before I was looking forward to the meal. However, as a number of other people have commented, the service has become awful and the quality of food no where near as good as it used to be. To be honest, one to avoid
5
Great evening meal here, with three generations ranging from 5 to 76 years old, all satisfied with their eats and drinks!Speights on tap for the Kiwi beer lovers, fantastic burgers, calamari, salads, a wide ranging menu catering for all tastes. All topped off with great views of Marina Bay and the evening laser show through the palm trees.

What a beautiful venue. It looks out into the marina area. We came for breakfast and it was relaxing to sit here and watch the world go by. There were marathon runners as well as families with young children on their bikes. The Marina area is also very nice and the chill music the restaurant was playing helped put us in the right moodThis restaurats is very child friendly and they had menus which my kids could colour. The children could order both from the breakfast or lunch menu even at 10am which is very helpful. I enjoyed my breakfast which was the chirozo ragout - so different from the normal fare - although they had all the usual suspects from a Western breakfast menu.Â Highly recommended.

We visited here for breakfast on a lovely Singapore morning. They are open as a bar/restaurant but I'll only be reviewing the breakfast. The location is amazing, right across the road from the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, jiat outside the Shoppes at Marina Bay shopping centre and about a 10 minute walk from the Merlion. The breakfast menu has vegetarian and gluten free options.The food overall was ok, classic western breakfast of good quality. The coffee wasn't very good, mine was pretty weak and milky. The service was very slow to the point where customers had to get up and find a waitress to get menus, order and even pay. They seemed to have adequate staff members so i dont know what the issue was.Overall, worth a visit for a western breakfast or a lazy coffee if you're nearby. Don't expect quick service though

I came here today to try the set lunch with a colleague. This consists of a fixed starter, a choice from a selection of alternative main courses, and a coffee or tea to finish with. I opten for the sirloin steak as the main, but was a little disappointed with the result. Asked for it to be served medium but came out pretty rare. The coffee at the end was good though. Overall cost was just under $50 for the 2 of us
3
I ordered the brekkie bun. The food was good but it was very very oily. Each time I cut the hash brown, oil flows out of it. The vegetable in my bun was soaked with oil until it was so glossy. Would recommend to order something else
4
Very nice open atmosphere bar and restaurant. Fine food, good service and fair prices. Great place if you are on your own in Singapore.
4
The hamburgers and the prawns were mouth watering at this bar. The drinks were served quick and the staff were attentive to our needs. Loved the laser show which could be seen from the bar.
3
Good place to go in that area of town e.g. after Art and Science Museum. Food OK but the times we have been there one person has always been waiting too long for their food. Service staff seems busy, but service is so so and can be difficult to get the attention of the service staff. Food is fine and they are very flexible in regards to the menu and the food ingredients are good quality
4
Food is great and reasonably priced. Portions are also good. Service was friendly and attentive. Kids can play by the walk way and it is also a good location to watch the Marina Bay Sands laser Light show, restaurant is right in front of it. They also have this Beer Pong Table which was awesome. ask the service staff about it. I recommend you try their Mojito, Its teh B-O-M-B..

More than 1 dirty utensil and plate. Forgot to punch our order. Another dirty utensil. And to top it all off, RUDE WAITRESS - sick attitude, makes it obvious that she hates her job, shouted at one of my friends. Food was generally just ok. Coffee drinks were nothing special. Churros is just fried batter - although yummy,it tasted like it was fried in oil used in savory food
1
We had food and drinks here, the food was not good, the service was not good. We had 2 glasses of wine each but when we got the bill, 2 of the glasses had been put down as something other than what we had, which was an extra $8 per glass more (around ÃÂ£4 each glass), the prices are already high so we queried it, they took the bill away and it took them another 15 minutes to get it sorted! Not a restaurant I would go back to
1
Had dinner here on a Saturday with my boyfriend and we were utterly disappointed with the service, it took more than half an hour to wait before our food came, and we were even more disappointed with the taste of the food. We ordered a pizza, lamb shoulder slider and sausage roll to share, but sad to say, the food is tasteless and badly done. When we ordered a 2nd beer, the beer never came and we couldn't get the attention of the waitstaff for more than 15mins, this is unacceptable! You can get better food from so many places in Singapore, go elsewhere for food, you can still come here for a drink and the view, that's all
4
Came here for dinner last night with our adult daughter and husband and it was really good fun but the grog is expensive!!! We each had a pizza around SG$21 each and they were nice crispy base, not oily and very good. We watched the lights show and a tropical storm with heavy rain from the inside. The music was terribly loud when we arrive and the speakers right above us, we asked for it to turn down and they very kindly oblige. The wines were very very expensive SG25++ for 1 glass and beers SG20++. It quickly adds up if each person has 2 or more!!You can go window shopping next door to the marina bay sands shops, hi end market branded shops but good to just look! Catch a cab home form the outside here

South Coast has become my usual breakfast place when I am in Singapore, for their tasty Aussie-style breakfast and good coffee and juices.As usual, I enjoyed the food and drinks a lot and the view out to Marina Bay through the palm trees.Also as usual, service was a bit on the slack side - somewhat slow and not especially enthusiastic. While that would bother be more in other contexts, here so long as you are expecting a relaxed, slow and somewhat indulgent big breakfast I think it's just part of the experience
1
Pre booked a table for a birthday drink and dinner. Turned up at 7am, got our drinks at the bar, sat at our table and........ Nothing. No offer of a menu and when our drinks came to an end, still nothing. After 30 mins of no service we explained our disappointment, not that anyone cared. Planned to have dinner there, sadly cannot comment on the food as there was no option. Will not be returning.
5
I was a very lucky guy to be part of a group who brought in NYE at South Coast. An outstanding bar with drinks replenished fast & tasty canapÃ©s provide all night....
Awesome Job!!!! Really enjoyed.
3
We tried their set lunch. Their fish n steak is nice but the coconut rice is hard n cold but the appetizer is satisfy. Over all it's just a quick lunch but no dessert end up with their latte is nice.... :)
4
The place is very casual, food is casual and the bar is pretty top notch.
Prices are fair, staff are friendly and everything basically screams Australian around there.
If you miss Australia, this is the place to go.
1
The venue is nicely situated on Marina Bay broadwalk. Unfortunately there was no service at all. Not even any waiting staff to try to get the attention of. Eventually our drinks we purchased at the bar ran out along with our patience, so we left. Poor service makes this venue a no go. There are so many other venues close by to spend money in and have a fun time.
5
Fantastic venue for drinks with good friends. I was a very lucky guy to be part of a group celebrating NYE at South Coast. The drinks were replenished all night & the canapÃÂ©s were damn tasty. On what is such a busy night the service was exceptional... Awesome job... Highly recommend this venue for a relaxing drink or drinks party by the Marina. P.s We enjoyed a view of the fireworks from our table which was perfect!
3
Have eaten at South Coast twice now & this place has so much potential but lacks service & care.Staff were happy to chat around the bar rather than come back to address a concern voiced about bones being in the kids fish. Fish & chips( besides the bones) were the nicest I have had. Pork belly sliders needed more pork belly and the salt & pepper calamari was missing the seasoning
4
The kids were hanging out for some western food. We decided to try South Coast. It don't disappoint. VB on tap. Burgers, fish and chips etc. it's pretty casual and friendly. We were there on a Friday night and it got a bit busy and noisy but all good. Staff helpful and friendly. Relaxing place to eat
4
Have the prosciutto and rocket pizza. You won't regret it. If you like your poison potent, don't order the sangria. If you like something refreshing and ditzy, order the sangria. If you're a musical junkie, like yours truly, this place often hosts the cast of a running show. They have a few autographed posters framed up. Great ambience.Food came late but service was good. They chatted to us and were quite nice. They also apologised for the wait. If you plan to stay past 7-8pm, make reservations. Most of their tables are booked for dinner time. We had to clear off and finish our bottle of wine standing up. It gets crowded

South Coast has the fortune of being in an ideal location by the waterfront, the style and decor are really lovely, the menu options are decent, and I love the laid-back ambience. It is actually a very nice place to sit outdoors and enjoy brunch on a sunny day. However, the service is absolutely shocking - I have been a couple of times, and it wasn't just during busy periods. I know service in Singapore does not rate high, but the staff here take apathy to a completely different level, appearing quite confused, forgetful, and swan about with a dont care attitude. For example we had to ask FOUR times for our drinks order to be delivered. Half an hour later, we had nearly finished our brunch when our fresh fruit juices appeared. Not good enough and if they had been more decent about it, they should not have charged us for these. The brunch options were very good, but ordered salads another time - lamb and cous cous, and a chicken / mango salad - and they were dreadful. My guess is most people return here for the lovely location and the ambience, but management really ought to sort out the utterly lacklustre service which customers suffer through
3
Decent place to chill over a beer at Marina Bay Sands and watch the world go by. I'd recommend the burgers if you're feeling hungry. Sitting outdoors by the waterfront is the way to go. Service is a little inattentive and it can get overly crowded at peak hours but drinks are fairly affordable and it's a nice respite from the all the shopping frenzy
5
The place is a fantastic bar to chill. This is by the waterfront and the drinks are affordable considering it's at the heart of the city. Fabulous place to chill at.
4
Just stopped here for beers. A bit pricey but the location and service made up for that. Good rang of international beers and cider on tap.
5
I'm probably biased being Australia, but South Coast is my favourite place to eat & drink at MBS. Located outside, its a great spot for people watching and looking over the bay. There is a good selection of drinks, and the food is outstanding - our personal favourite are the pizzas. We had our engagement party here earlier in the year and were very well looked after. A great place to grab a bite to eat before or after watching a show, hitting one of the nightclubs or the casino at MBS
4
South Coast is actually quite a cool place. I've been several times and always managed to find a seat inside. Frankly, if I couldn't sit inside, I wouldn't eat there - it's just too hot and exposed outside. What I love about it is the decor and the vibe; it does feel like a beach cafe, even though it's miles from the nearest grain of sand. It is a little pricey, but the venue commands a premium, I guess. Good pizza and salads, and it's nice and quiet during the day
3
Went with children prior to seeing a show. Seating is limited, so recommend calling ahead. Not all tables have a great view (some are blocked by Louis Vuitton). Service is below average. As others mentioned, even though there are only a few tables (and all seating is outdoors--hot with direct sun, nice with breeze in early evening), the waiters are quite scarce. We had to call ours over/flag him down multiple times. Pizza is good; prices are high. Ambience was not great for kids as lots of smoke and drinking
1
Was there for a birthday celebration, the food and ambience is fantastic. BUT the service is extremely disappointed. Asked the staff what is their specialty, they are not able to answer. In additional, there's an hidden charge that the staff did not even notify us about that, there's an $30 surcharge for keeping and cutting of the cake in SOUTH COAST. We were blamed by the manager/supervisor that it was our fault for not making it known to the reservation staff upon confirmation. Extremely not PROFESSIONAL at all. This is our first visit and it will be our LAST visit
3
First of all it's in a great location. By Marina Bay near all the shopping. The outdoor seating was fine for us, but we did go for brunch. Afternoon I could see getting a little stifling.Service was good, but I'm sure that had more to do with the place being more than half empty as it was a Thursday morning. Staff was friendly and pleasant though. They smiled, answered questions, were pleasant with my 5 yr old.Food was ok, but for the price you pay wow I'd expect a lot more. That being said it's one of the restaurants that you can use the MB casino reward points on
4
South Coast does a tasty "Australian-style" cooked breakfast, with nice fresh juices and good coffee.Service is fine, and the location is convenient at Marina Bay with a pleasant view. Not quite as relaxed as some of the places I used to frequent for breakfast around Robertson Quay, but still quite pleasant
5
Lovely setting right on the bay, outside seating amongst the palm trees. This is a favourite haunt for evening cocktails before clubbing, or a lazy sunday lunch. The food is really good, and they do pizzas until quite late in the evening, which are relatively small but really good. Love the decor too, and really lovely bar staff
3
Service was friendly and beers were cold. Asked about the 'freshly shucked' oysters and was told that they literally just arrived a couple of minutes ago. Ordered half a dozen. They came resting on a bed of sea salt with fancy peppercorns, cloves and anise. Unfortunately they were room temperature and smelled really fishy. There was also a yellowish rim on the inner shell, something you will not find on a fresh oyster. As for the view, other bars/ eateries on this promenade have a better view as they are not blocked by the Louis Vuitton extension
