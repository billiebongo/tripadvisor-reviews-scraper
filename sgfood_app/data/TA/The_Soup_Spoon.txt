This is a great place to stop for lunch. I particularly like the spicy tomato soup. And while they are called the soup spoon, their flatbread's are also very tasty.

If you want a nice hot bowl of soup this is the place. They have a good range of soups, salads, sandwiches and wraps. It is a good place to sit down if you are in the area. A tip-at lunchtime-it is a very popular place with nearby office workers. It was cheap and quickly served
