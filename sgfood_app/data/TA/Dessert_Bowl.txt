This joint had been around for a while and their quality maintained.
It's no surprise that long queues are often visitble snaking its staircase even stretching out to the porch.
Their durian desserts are smooth, flavourful and fulfilling.
Definitely worth a try.

Located on the 2nd floor approximately 100 yards from Serangoon Food Center, it look like it needed some re-decoration and renovation and the sofas are too worn off and the springs are getting too soft for many year of use. Once you sit, you sink into the sofa and hard to get up again. Being said, the desserts and coffee are wonderful. Go for the dessert and not fo the decor and you will not regret it

A local resident recommended us to try this dessert shop as it is very famous. As soon as you are on the stairs, you will smell the aroma of durian which fills the whole shop. The whole place was already packed around 9:15p.m. We were lucky finding seats only waited for a few minutes.We ordered a double shot durian mousse for SS$6, but the enjoyment and satisfaction are far beyond the price.The grass jelly with longan fruit and coconut milk was very refreshing. The atmosphere was great. The place was filled with noise from the customers, socializing over the desserts.By the time we left, the queue was triple longer

Great place to grab some nice desserts in Serangoon Garden. It's been there for a while, and has built quite a following. You'll find it crowded and packed to the brim on weekend nights, but it's relatively empty on the weekday afternoons, which is a nice time to come by. Try out their top 3 desserts: Durian Mousse (durian flavoured mousse with some durian meat on the top), Aiyu Mango (Mango with some milk in it and aiyu jelly) and Mango Pomello. Also, try out their Mango/Strawberry snow. It's ice cream with mango and pearls. Really nice.Great place to come for desserts after grabbing dinner at Chomp Chomp. I personally like to come by on the weekday afternoons, where it's quiet and I can sit at the sofa area reading a book

This place has been around for several years but it is the first time I am here because on previous occasions, it was always full but we were there on a very quiet afternoon. In terms of the furnishing...you could certainly tell that things seem a little worn out but its still comfortable. This place has some nice/interesting displays though. I am really not a fan of durians but my friends insisted that I try the durian mousse, i did and was impressed. The desserts are reasonably priced and there is quite a variety! :) Thumbs up

Visited this place for its durian mousse after a family dinner. It is as always most satisfying dessert after dinner as always, the service was good and attentive even the place is always crowded . Yeah no regrets , best durian mousse in town. Should try at least once

This is a small, out of the way place in the Serangoon Garden Circus area. The best known feature of the area is Chomp Chomp, a small hawker center featuring seafood. Dessert Bowl is on a side street and up a flight of stairs, so it can easily be missed. Don't miss it. The desserts are excellent. My wife had the durian mousse and said it was great. Not having acquired a taste for durian, I had the mango ice (not to be confused with the mango snow mountain). It had extra sweet chunks of mango swimming in mango syrup, topped by vanilla ice cream. I've had ice cream at Udders in Singapore and it was good. This ice cream was fantastic. The whole dessert was great
