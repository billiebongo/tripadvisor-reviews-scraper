Time your visit to get super good baguettes straight out of the oven. The other bread/pastry things, like most of Singapore, look better than they taste. The cafe also runs baking classes which would be fun with relatives or friends.

We first came for Mont blanc and have now returned for cream puff.
Tried the Ribeye steak. It's ok with good french fries. Coffee float also ok.
As part of Tampopo group, we should be able to collect points?

Very satisfied with the Japanese matcha chiffon sliced cake here. Good for sharing, will definitely be back for more.

Came here for lunch with friends. Part of tampopo and its dessert arm . The lunch menu was full of pastas and such stuff, not very appetising. The cakes were average. Service also average and DYI

Went to this cafe for desserts and they served chiffon cakes, Japanese style. Very soft and tasty. However find the price a tat too pricey.
5
Went here quite a few times to pick up a delicious array of shortcakes, very yummy. Nice and handy as they are in quite a few malls. Good standard of food.

We had breakfast here - there was really nothing else around that offered a sweet (European style) breakfast. They have a few options on the menu and the food wasn't too bad. So we were quite happy with the find!

We went there after dinner for some dessert. Ordered the yuzu chiffon cake, tea pudding and strawberry pudding. The chiffon cake was light and went well with the yuzu cream which was sweet and tart. The milk puddings were very good. Not too sweet. They serve lunch and dinner too

I really love how soft their chiffon is. Tried their matcha chiffon & Kyoto grape and both were awesome. Have tried their yuzu and strawberry during previous visits and realized their standard has improved from what was already good. Iâ€™ve not tried their main course but would highly recommend Dulcet & Studio as a tea or dessert place

We have been to Singapore on three occasions now and on each visit we go to Dulcet & Studio for cake - they make fantastic ones!!On this occasion though I found the place had been revamped, which was aesthetically pleasing but I found the prices had risen by quite a bit.Food was still as delicious and the cakes still as scrumptious as ever, value for money though - definitely not

Situated at Liang Court is this enticing eatery which serves up a seductive selection of delicious desserts!
The impressive array of chiffon cakes are particularly praiseworthy!
4
Th matcha lava cake is a good try, had a green tea layer cake too. They do served freshly brew coffee and there is jalanese coffee such as sumiyaki.
They also practice clear your own plates system.

Nice cozy cafe tucked in Liang Court. Food is Japanese/Italian fusion, interesting and tasted great. Quiet location so great for dating couples.

Having a Japanese pastry chef churn out the desserts on sale here is a good move, as the items are of consistent good quality. Best in my opinion is the strawberry shortcake; fluffy, moist and rich in distinct flavours. Pricey though.

Great place to chill. Offers a variety of cakes and coffees at reasonable prices. The cream puff is a must try but you can find tastier cakes at other places.

I went for a couple days with my husband to Singapore and stopped by for a treat. I got the fruit scoop cake and it was so delicious I went back the next day for another! Cute little restaurant and good service!
1
Ordered 2 cakes , 2 cappuccino and 2 Apple juice.Waited 20min and everything canes except the Apple juice.Finished the cakes and cappuccino still not serve. After checking, they had totally forgotten the juices !As my kids unable to take orange juice so we rejected when they ask to change from Apple to orange juice.And again after waited another 15min, was told they needed more time as the juice is very cloudy !The disappointment is because everyone in their store gave a nonchalant behaviour !!!Nice setting but that's all

Offering Japanese-Italian fare, the lunch sets (SGD 12.90) include your choice from two options, a salad (or soup), coffee (or tea) and a dessert. With a simple but nice layout, the restaurant is self-service in that you order at the counter, and the waitstaff bring the food to you. The seating area is inside, behind the bakery where you can buy fresh bread and cakes. Although the concept is simple, the food was good and the atmosphere was clean and bright

Ordered hot ginger and lemon tea. It cost about $6++. Expected to see a teapot but we were surprised it came in a normal mug with tea bag thrown in. When we asked for a refill of hot water, another rude shock. Hot water cost an extra $0.50. The cappuccino from other cafe or even fast food restaurant look better than the one we ordered here. No foam art but foam and cocoa powder were in a mess. For this kind of price, I think I can get better service and quality elsewhere. Will not visit again.

Dulcet & Studio gets a lot of acclaim for its Japanese chiffon cakes, so I decided to give them a try with my mum upon visiting Liang Court. I had the Strawberry Shortcake and my mum had the Banana Bailey, both for $7 each. I don't know about the other food, but the cakes really aren't worth the hype in my opinion, especially for their price. They look pretty, but the taste isn't anything spectacular. While they are fluffy and soft, but they are fairly bland and the cream is too buttery. Nonetheless, the spongy texture is definitely true to the Japanese style
