Offering delicious ramen with different soup bases and value lunch sets, this joint definitely offers the best ramen and service in town.

There are many Ramen restaurants springing up in Singapore, yet I always end up returning to this after sampling other Ramen restaurants... The main reason: Its price for the consistent quality here in Chabuton has yet been matched in my experience... Service is great too...!!

Sublime! this was a lovely and very reasonably priced meal. We had the ramen and a number of appetizers. The ramen was by far the best part of the night.

Not too bad a place for ramen but not worth it to queue up for. There is lunch set but the portion is small.

I was told that this was a Michellin starred ramen restaurant, so perhaps was expecting too much. I had the large Tonkatsu ramen, which only had 1 very thin slice of pork and the rest was noodles. The extra egg ordered provided a little more protein. The soup was tasty but a little too salty for my liking. We had the dumplings which seemed to be skin and no filling. Overall a disappointing meal

Came here today for lunch with a colleague and tried one of the Donburi sets for around $12 all in. Service was a bit slow today but the food was tasty. It's a very popular place at lunchtime and it seemed like some people were struggling to get a seat

Had the Yoruton Special at the level 3 for heat. Was the perfect level of heat. Also had an order of fried oysters that had excellent flavor. The beer was beer, what can I say. Service was fast and food was fine. Price was OK but a little expensive for what it was. I'd go back but wouldn't seek it out

Not the first time we are here at this Michelin Star ramen shop. Have been to their shop in Japan and I wish they'll bring the tomato based soup ramen to Singapore. It's really good. Anyway, the service here is still as good and the broth, excellent. If there's anything to nitpick, it'll be the sesame seeds in the soup. Not everyone likes them. I just wish they'd ask during the ordering process so that we need not pick them out for my little one. Gyoza and the tamago is really good too. A must have side to order. PS: Gyoza is different from the usual ones. They're flat here.

The char siu is wafer thin. I dunno why... Is it like sliced shaved ham or what? Noodles ok. Soup, not very salty. I like it this way. Some ramen soups are so salty they give me a headache. I could drink all the soup in this one. BUT it's really oily. A layer of oil on the top. I know in Japan, ramen soups have a layer of oil on top due to the fat from the pork and the oil helps keep the soup / noodles hot in the cold weather. BUT this is Singapore, we really don't need to keep our noodles hot, the weather is not cold. Not very much toppings on the noodles for this price. $13+ for tonkotsu ramen. The kaki oyster fry was ok $6 for 3 small pieces. Portion can be bigger. I think 4 pieces minimum. Amaebi fry shrimp was quite nice. Addictive. Crisp and hot. Freshly cooked. Better than some other shops which serve pre-cooked soggy ones. Main gripe -- charging 50 cents for water!! That's insane. We buy your food. We dine in your restaurant, WE PAY DAMN SERVICE CHARGE, you don't even serve us a small cup of water?!? I find this downright ridiculous. For this reason , I WONT BE BACK. There's plenty of ramen shops around. Plenty better than this shop with better food and service. So why should I come back? Plus, no free water. It's not even mineral water they serve. Just tap water anyway. Yikes! Unimpressed.

Chance upon this Jap joint in Millenia Walk and was determined to find out how's their broth! It's good! Superb actually. They even have different spicy level to choose.. I kinda regretted choosing level 3.. It was simply too much. I'm a chilli lover.. But this is hot! Go for a lower level if you can't take spicy. It's a perfect location for family with kids. Staff can be more attentive. Not much choices for kids meal though.
