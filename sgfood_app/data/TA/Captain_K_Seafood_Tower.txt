My family are very happy with the service and especially the food. We had 9 tier of seafoods and it was very fresh and yummy!
5
Order their rice cake! it's good! Food quality is superb and fresh. Ginseng soup base is nice! Portion for meat is small. Pricey but worth it.
5
Excellent service, best seafood ever at affordable price..the prawns are a MUST TRY! Thank you for great service!
5
Awesome experience with fresh and great seafood... wide range of variety and now with my favorite steamboat... The Ginseng Chicken and Tomato Soup base is my personal favorites..
Will be back for more!!!
5
Ginseng chicken & tomatoes soup is very yummy. Fish paste is also delicious. Service staff is very attentive.
4
The overall experience was a good one. I liked the freshness of the steamed seafood, and the option to have some steamboat when we reach the last tier. A nice meal overall!
3
on the high side, however, interesting concept. great for first timer. family and friends. polite staff
2
Other days would have been rated “terrible”. Clams straight from the shore and fresh that i could have swore Siloso Beach was in my mouth. Waiter tried to hard sell too much that he deserve an A for effort for trying to sell me a combo when i saved $80 with an ala carte add on. There was no Ginseng in the Ginseng Chicken soup base we ordered. Highly inferior as compared to the experience we had enjoyed at the NTUC Income Building outlet

This is my first time at Captain K Seafood Tower. Have seen many places offering these steamboat seafood towers but was looking for a reasonably priced one.I should say Captain K is value for money as the seafood is very fresh.Enjoyed the fresh oysters thoroughly as it was big, juicy & fresh @6 for $30Will definitely be back there again
5
Quality of seafood as what i expected, my friends and i with the total of 11 people had the 9 tier seafood tower, which includes the standard varieties of seafood with comes with additional Thai squid,two Boston lobsters and one Chilean king crab. Every kind of seafood taste good especially the prawns and clams were the most satisfying dish amount the tiers itself. We also ordered their recommend chef selection of Sri Lanka mud crab which was also up to our expectation even though it was only a normal steam crab, however they retain the freshness of the crab !!!! Apart from the food, the service crews working there were all very friendly, i would like say that their services were very good, they even help us to cut open the Chilean king crab as it was difficult for us to do! Cheers to those service crews that served us!!!! WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK FOR MORE
4
Quality seafood and excellent service. Seafood was fresh and soup was fabulous! Liked the ambience as well as it was not very crowded
3
Steamboat tomato soup can be richer. However the food serving is relatively big. A bit pricey. Ginseng chicken is strongly recommended for its richness.
5
Exceptionally fresh seafood and good customer service ... a must try for all seafood lover *thumbs up!
5
We would like to commend on Matthew's disposition. He was fantastic, polite and attentive to our needs.
5
The service given by the staff were great, and many recommendations were given by the staff who handled our order. Though the waiting time is abit long due to shortage of staff, but on the overall I am glad with the service.
4
Up to the standard as stated on the website
Quiet and good environment
Attentive service staff
Cost abit on the high side but quality of food is great
3
Mussels were too salty, pricing too high, not attractive. The condiments & sauces have a wide variety but will be gd to provide some recommended pairings for different food.
4
2nd visit to Captain k. First time to this outlet. This store has bbq items on the menu. They served bbq and not bbq by yourself. Service was good. Seafood fresh. There are many condiments / sauces to choose from. Pricing definitely on the high side. The tier seafood is standard, you can’t change. If you don’t eat mussels or oysters .. can’t change can’t replace. Can get better value of money if going to a normal seafood restaurant. The carb was tiny. Don’t bother ordering. The soup are the bottom was bland. Need to pay extra for special soup.
5
Ordered a 3-tier tower, one of each flavour of Hokkaido scallop, 1 cheese-baked oyster, 1 Boston lobster and 2 Melona Mocktail. The best seafood out of all these is the cheese-baked oyster and the 2 oysters in the 3-tier tower. Soft and juicy. Next best would be the Hokkaido scallops. The Boston lobster was a bit salty though. As for the Melona Mocktails, they were something like potong ice creams in milk shakes
5
3 girls, 2 didn't want carbs for dinner so the three tiered seafood was agreed on. The clams & prawns were so sweet you could practically have them without any sauce. All the seafood served was fresh and it was just enough for us to start off. As we'd also ordered items from the steamboat menu. The squid balls were not your usual frozen ones, it looked like they were freshly made, and had a good flavour & texture to it. Given we'd now come to expect that the food here is at a much better quality than your usual frozen variety, wasn't surprised when the beef slices came that were so tender. We just stuck it in the pot for a few seconds and it was so good. It was a great dinner, good food in an easily accessible location. Totally recommend it.
4
Interesting concept where you can choose 5, 7 or 9 tiers of seafood goodness. You can also order ala carte stuff for the last tier of steamboat soup. Attentive service. It is a good place for gathering of friends.
4
Nice atmosphere but pricing abit costly, however there is a on going promotion . Still not bad afterall
5
The seafood is fresh. The service is fantastic. Brought my own wine and they were very nice to help me (without me asking) to put in ice bucket for chilling.
4
The place looks clean, hygienic and spacious. The food were nice. Good for family gathering. Food price might be abit steep.
5
Staff are friendly and accommodating to our needs. Seafood is very fresh! Will definitely visit again!
4
Fresh seafood, interesting experience but not super yummy. attentive staff and pretty good membership promo. overall worthwhile trying. provides gloves n apron to prevent dirtying of clothes. maybe a simple finger food could be offered while waiting - other than cold kimchi.
1
poor food quality: oysters were not sweet nor succulent, prawns were not fresh, I had to rinse my mouth to get rid of the taste. Sri Lankan crab was 500gm n cost more than $50. overall meal for 2 pax was $169! I shd have celebrated the birthday dinner at another restuarant to enjoy better seafood
4
I think most of the time when we order our food we are mindful of food wastage. The staff was quick to advice we might have over order and remind us to review our order. Thatâ€™s nice. Staff were attentive and observant. Great ambient, great service and great food. Feel totally satisfied and contented. Thank you
5
Me and my family went on a weekend. We ordered the 9 tier menu. Service staff worried that we were not able to finish it and suggest a lower tier. However we insisted on the 9 tier. All the sea food are fresh. Staff even help and demo removing the alaska king crab shell. It was a memorable experiences as my family took alot of great photo
3
Remember saw 30% discount for seafood when booking at Chope but restaurant say 10%. Seafood tower tier package too rigid, need to allow customer to select type of seafood. We dont eat mussel and wasted. Price need to review for a la carte seafood and soup base.
4
The service staff are very courteous and attentive. The seafood is fresh and delicious but pricing is on the high side. Expect to pay about $40-50 per pax.
4
First time try out this restaurant. Ordered 5 tier seafood for a pax of 3 plus king size butter garlic prawn. Seafood is very fresh! Will visit with family to try the 9 tier seafood.
1
Food served was not fresh.
When reported of defect, a reduced amount of food was given.
Staff was not properly train to explain to customer which is a better choice of selection.
Time taken to serve is too long.
4
Environment was good and accessible if you know the place. Abit costly but worth to try it once.
Overall experience was good.
5
The tiers of seafood were really fresh and worth every cent! The scallops were the best, with the vermicelli noodles and garlic sauce!
5
nice family restaurant. food was very delicious. seafood was fresh. the ginseng chicken soup was awesome. the chicken was so soft to the bones. When we went there it was not very crowded.
3
We ordered a 9-tier tower. The seafood are fresh, thou the crab was a bit overcooked by the time we ate. The staffs don't seems to be very clear of what is going on. requests hv to be made at least twice before they get it right. Service needs to be improved.
4
Ordered the 9 tier seafood for 4 people. Every tier was yummy. The seafood were indeed very fresh!Disappointment is the Alaskan king crab, it came as the 5th or 6th tier, you can either cut up the crab or ask the kitchen to do it. For ease, we ask kitchen to do it. Apparently kitchen steam it hot AGAIN before sending back to the table. Thus the meat became too dry. Restaurant should have ask customer at the start of dinner then only steam ONCE depend on customers decision. The most expensive tier destroyed. Last, restaurant should not have charge for base soup especially not for the 9 tier order. Or at least offer some basic soup base as free. Else everything else including service is good.
5
Celebrated mum's birthday here. Wanted to try something different instead of chilli crab at jumbo. It's a restaurant good for friends and colleagues or group outing. Not as suitable for family with old folks. Ordered 7 tiers and they gave us steamed lotus buns after knowing that it is my mum's birthday. Very good service. Seafood is fresh, especially shell fish. Chicken soup was thick and creamy. We enjoyed the food here very much. Portion was adequate but can be bigger. Lo

Must give good rating for the good service. Attentive to customer and helpful. Seafood is generally fresh, but don't expect live seafood quality which is a little disappointing for STEAMED SEAFOOD. Ordered 1 Crab, 1 Boston Lobster, 1 tier scallop, 1 tied prawn with kimchi soup base for 2 of us !!! too much ! And didn't know we got another free crab because of birthday ! Super super full. Boss was good to let us take away( normally no due to food safety, we ensure boss we know what we are doing ) Food taste is pure salt and seafood taste, nothing fanciful, so good for seafood purist. Overall experience is good. For me, because I am a Chinese TeoChew so my demand for steam seafood is live seafood so don't take my comments ( asking for the moon ) Price is a little high for non-live seafood. But ok for the expereince.
3
Good for family dinners...kids had fun eating off the layers. Seafood was fresh but price is steep though. Not much crowd when we went on a Saturday. The ginseng Chicken soup base was good though.
5
Had Choosn this place to statisfed our seafood craving. They provided excellent service and food was great. Gonna return once again for more.
4
It is my 3rd visit, the staff is always on standby to help remove the finished tray, empty your bin and top up hot water for your tea.
1
Tried 5-tier seafood tower and added an additional tier for crab. Crab was tiny and overcharged for the size. Other than being generous with clams and mussels, the prawns small and at most 10 pcs for the tier.
4
Fresh seafood n v yummy ginseng chicken soup to end the meal. The only thing is the squid with stuffed rice is no longer available which is a must order for us in the past. Hope they bring it back.
3
Been there twice. Food is good with excellent service. Just that compared to my previous visit, this time round lesser crowd.
4
Not too bad an experience. Service was good. Restaurant was clean and not noisy. Easy to locate restaurant and it is within walking distance from MRT for those not driving. For those driving, can park at Bugis Junction or Bugis Plus. However, price is a bit on the high side.
4
Went on Thursday night. Not many people. Service is excellent, staff are alert to help remove the tray and plates when empty. Seafood is fresh. We had tom yam tomato soup base for steamboat at the end and it was good. Price on the high side snd serving not big. But it's a novelty. Crab not the ones who find at jumbo. Pretty tiny and not much meat.
4
My 2nd time at Captain K and the experience was just as good as the first. Fresh seafood and tasty broth. Only thing is we couldn't swap one item for another. But that was ok. We were also a group of 3 and there was no inbetween tier option. 2 would be too little and 4 was a little too much for us. Overall still worth a try
5
This is the first time I had Captain K seafood tower at Middle Road. It is very much quieter then the main branch at Princep Street. It was confusing at first when we reached the location, as it was located on the second floor of another Korean bar. However, when we were guided upstairs, we had found their service to be excellent when they offered selections with a smile and prompt in our requests. The food were served very fresh and clean.
5
we went on a sunday night, so not many people. the service is very good. the waiters is very friendly.
4
Visited Captain K Seafood Tower recently with my family. The seafoods are fresh and service staff were friendly.
3
Food was average. However, too pricey. Not worth the price for the amount of food. Just be aware that the staff will sell you add on food items which are expensive. There are definitely other places that are more worth to visit than here.
4
The food is good and fresh. You get constant help to clear your shells. The restaurant have a Nice ambient.
5
Never expect such good service for the price u paying. Constantly attentive to our request. Food is fresh.
4
The seafood was fresh, service staff was attentive in clearing plates. Place was clean. Food is a little on the pricey side though
5
The seafood was very fresh and sweet. It was quite fun to finish the food in one tray before it was removed to reveal what was in the next tray. The ginseng chicken soup was a great way to end the meal!
3
Unless you're a die-hard shellfish fan, you may find the tiers indigestible or even risk a stomach flu.
4
My family and I enjoyed our dinner at Captain K. We ordered the seafood tower for 6 pax - seafood served were very fresh. All our favourite was the scallop! But the soup at the end was a bit disappointing, we were expecting the sweetness seafood but it was really bland
4
Visited captain recently for dinner. The area was clean and spacious. Service was prompt and the staff were polite and attentive, constantly showing up to remove the tray the moment we finished the layer of seafood. Seafood was fresh and delicious, although it was slightly overpriced, but still an enjoyable experience nonetheless.Thank you
5
I didnt expect to be serve with steam longevity bun hidden inside the steamer and with my friend's birthday cake in the next layer. Staff very proactive to remove the finishes tray without being ask to do so. Will visit again..
5
The food was nice and the service was attentive and not intrusive. Surprisingly, it was not crowded at all on a Saturday afternoon.
4
First dining experience here and when first enter you will smell the typical seafood stench. However, once settled down, it will be fine and seafood is good. For me, i like the customer services provided.
4
Generally the seafood is fresh. Oyster however is overcooked.. Staffs are prompt and good service. Enjoyable
5
Warming comfort seafood, nice cocktail drinks and ended with a delicious chicken soup. Good for at least 5 paxs and above.
4
Good food, good service, great experience, have great fun with friends eating the layers of seafood. Will go back again.
4
I ordered premium chicken soup as soup base. Which impressed me is that there was a full chicken stuffing with rice. When seafood was finished,we had steamboat one more round. This is impressive idea!
3
I would recommend this place for the novelty and the fresh and sweet steamed seafood. However, the service needs to be improved as a mistake they made could be easily rectified by making the customer happy instead of turning it into an unhappy affair. I didn't rate it below average as the assistant manager so called saved the situation.
3
The seafood were fresh and generous. And there were enough sauces to choose from. But I don't really like the concept though. I would like to have a taste of the soup while having the seafood. But unfortunately, I had to wait till the end because the soup was at the base of the tower. And by the time we reached it, we were already too full to appreciate it. While the food came in generous amounts, there was wastage as we couldn't finish the food and they didn't allow us to doggy bag them. It wasn't as if it was a buffet. I hate wasting food. So the management should consider allowing patrons to doggy bag unconsumed foo
5
The seafood was very fresh and the soup is very appetizing. Their staff there was very diligent and tries to meet our needs and made sure our seafood was kept fresh. However, they should improve on their sauces. The prices for the seafood on the other hand is rather expensive. Overall, we enjoyed the food there
1
It was an expensive and disappointed dinner. Need an improvement on food and ambient/atmosphere. Staff were friendly.
3
The seafood is steam and they put it in towering steam set. Fresh and tasty. Good portion for sharing with family. Pricey if you add crabs into the menu
4
Prawns, crabs and clams were very fresh and delicious.
Mussels were a bit dry.
Suggest to provide plain water for meals as drinks were quite expensive.
4
Seafoods are fresh and the service is good, waiter serve very promptly Staffs very friendly. The soup abit too salty.
3
For seafood lover. To eat layer by layer. Personally i like the last layer whereby we can add ramen and other ingredients. A unique experience
5
Staff was very attentive.
Nice ambience.
Seafood was very fresh.
Not sure its that worth d price thou.
A bit too pricey.
4
We were celebrating a birthday so we brought a cake to the restaurant. Our seafood towers came out to our surprise with a first tier of birthday buns! Sweet! We were so delighted with that!
3
Not great for the kind of price they charged. Food is really average considering it is only one flavour across all seafood. We ordered a crab and it turned out rather small and pricey. Not a place I'll visit again.
2
The first impression of the restaurant was good as we entered the premises. It was bright, clean, and everything from the cutlery on our table to the options of sauces at the sauce counter spread is in place. The menu, however, was not easy to decipher at all. It was not clear what we would get out of each item we ordered. For example, the basic set for 2 said "Chef Selection" of seafood items and we didn't know what exactly was in this selection until we asked a server. We also observed that most customers started with the basic and then added 'layers' and that was when the cost started to stack up (pun unintended). The restaurant offered each layer of seafood by weight and it was not easy to gauge exactly how many seafood items (e.g. number of prawns or scallops) one would get with every additional layer. The basic konbu soup base tasted like vegetable soup and this was after we had the basic set + prawn + squid + scallop layers on top. The service was good and that helped to make up for the poor value for money for the food served. The overall cleanliness, the wet wipes and disposable bib covers made the experience more pleasant too. I gave away the $20 return voucher to the nearest table the moment I got it from the cashier. My friends and I had decided before paying that we were unlikely to return to this restaurant.
3
The food was basically shellfish after shell fish. Sauces offered were also limited. Soup provided were dashi, kimchi($10) and ginseng chicken(+18) which was quite expensive. The original soup was bland, even after all the seafood juices had sunk to the bottom. Went on a weekday midweek so there were plenty of tables. However service was remarkable. Constantly asking if we needed any help or coming by timely to remove the expanded trays
5
Went for a family dinner. The place was spacious, clean and hygenic. Great for family gathering. The price is at the steep end
3
Visited the restaurant on a Saturday night with friends and family. I would say the food was average and price was steep.
2
The air conditioning was cold and I think that made our food turned cold very quickly despite turn up the steamer.
5
Went in a group of 19 with one table of young kids. Kids love the food there. Service was excellent. The staff were very attentive n friendly. Made the entire dining experience excellent. Seafood was very fresh.
Keep it up!!!!
5
The place was spacious and clean with cool K-pop music videos playing softly on the television screens. As it was our first time there, the service staff was very helpful in advising us on the number of tiers to order and how the seafood tower works. Service was also very prompt.The seafood was so fresh and delectable, and cooked perfectly. The broth at the very end was rich and full of umami flavour. One of the service staff overheard that I was "disappointed" when they accidentally skipped the video of my favourite Korean song. He immediately went to replay the music video for me, which was really sweet and great customer service. Will definitely be back
4
We had a table of 8 pax with 2 children. Pretty packed around the table, table was constantly filled up with utensils, tissues, sauces, etc.- constantly scrambling to find space for something. The seafood of 7 towers was very fresh and we enjoyed the food very much. Quite expensive (about $360 for the 8 adults). The staff were brilliant!! They were super friendly, responsive and helpful.
4
Despite all the reviews on how the seafood is over steamed and overcooked, it depends on how you time your eating through the towers. If timed well, the food is actually very nice, fresh and juicy. I've been here twice. Of course, if compared to similar restaurants in Korea itself, this is much more expensive.
3
We chose the 9 tiers steamer hoping to try every thing but we left not fully satisfied.Not that the food is not fresh but it just lacked the wow factor. As the seafood is pre cooked it ended up being more over cooked than otherwise.The first tier is the clams which is small but juicy followed shrimps which are very fresh. The third tier is mussels and then the huge crab. In general the seafood are very fresh and the accompanying sauces are good especially the belachan.The biggest disappointment is the huge oyster which we end up not having it as it lack the sweetness it should have Overall a nice but expensive experience ....which if u ask, we will not retu
4
Only restaurant serving steamed seafood - the best to enjoy the sweetness of fresh seafood. We ordered the starter course for 2 people which included shrimp, clams, scallop, crayfish, mussels and oyster. We added the Sri Lankan mud crab. For soup, we chose the premium ginseng chicken. Kimchi was provided as part of the meal. I chose the Thai Chili sauce to go with the I enjoyed the full experience of eating seafood with the hand - peeling the shrimp shells, picking the clams and mussels, opening the crab claws and securing the scallop cooked with bihon.Because of the large amount of seafood, some of the shells were overcooked as steam from the soup continued to cook the seafood.And there was the chicken cooked in the ginseng soup. Chicken was tender and soup was quite tasty.A great new find. We will be back
4
Easily accessible location. Very friendly staff from the time booking was made over the phone. Call back to remind booking & readily accept time change and request for specific seating location. Food was fresh, though not hot enough. Disposable apron and gloves were provided. Interesting to have the cushion of stools lifted to store bags. Service was perfect. Staff cleared empty layer immediately after we finished the food without us feeling their intruding presence. Trash bags by the table for seafood shells were cleared quickly too. Staff were ready to peel seafood shells for us when we had difficulty handling them. Recommended for a new experience
1
Worst meal ever! Seafood are not fresh ...4 pax dine in 3 pax got diarrhoea. Cup is not clean , got raw food smell...! Never ever go back again.
3
the restaurant is located near Bugis street m and serves a steamed Korean seafood ,the stuff is friendly and the service is almost perfect .You can enjoy the 5 stages seafood platters for 4 persons ,but i didn't really enjoyed the steamed seafood Also the price is very expensive compared to the food quantity and quality ,but i tried it as a new experienc
2
Interesting concept with layers of seafood in a steamer, service staff were attentive and quick to clear the empty layers However, taste is mediocre and the seafood are not Fresh. Some of the dishes were either overcooked or barely warm as they are basically steaming frozen seafood which are mostly precooked. Overall, not worth the visit for overpriced Frozen seafood
3
Their Yu Sheng is fantastic. We ordered a 9 layer but the taste is average. The portion is also not enough for 8 adults and a child. Seats are abit squeezy too. What attract us to this restaurant their concept of standing to eat the seafood layer by layer from a very tall steamer
2
Came with my colleagues, total 3 ladies and 1 guy. Seafood was fresh but portion is small. Slightly overpriced i generally felt. 1.5 hrs eating time to consume the 7 tiers is kinda stressful for diners. Cant really enjoy the food. Doubt will eat there again
5
There were 8 of us who visited this restaurant just before the Chinese New Year festivities began. It is fairly new and was doing very good business for a mid week evening. We had a round table which was great for permitting lots of conversation. The staff were very welcoming and took the time to explain the concept to us. Some have described this as 'steamboat' but it is very different. We had a stack of 9 steamer pans each with a different seafood. During the evening we had prawns, crayfish, mussels, oysters, lobster, crab, scallops and calamari. The juices ran through the pans into the soup at the base. We opted to include a chicken and some ginseng. By the end of the evening the chicken had cooked perfectly and was falling off the bone. None of it was left. I loved the idea that we sat on stools that the seat was removable and became a small 'dustbin' that your bags could be safely stored during the meal. It was a fun evening with good friends, good food and good conversation. The serving guys were excellent. Many of our Singaporean friends intend to visit. They will not be disappointed

Came across the fb page of Captain K Seafood Tower 2 months ago and decided to give it a try. 5 of us made a reservation at 6.30 p.m. (we were told we have to finish by 8.00 p.m.). As it was first time for us, we took about 10 minutes to decide the number of tiers we want. The staff was very helpful, explaining to us the different tiers, etc. We settled for 7 tiers and added a crab too.While waiting for our food, we had our drinks which were free flow. The food arrived after about 10-15 minutes - in a 8-tier high tower. The cover was lift to reveal the first tier of fresh prawns. It was sweet and the flesh was firm. The prawns were gone in a jiffy and the attentive staff immediately took away the empty tray. The next tier was full of mussels and white clams. The next few tiers tantalised our taste buds with baby lobsters, scallops, crab, squid, etc. The base was a pot of kimchi soup base into which we added sliced pork, sausage, fish balls, etc to make a pot of steamboat. Needless to say, the 5 of us could hardly move after all this lovely food.The portion served was more than sufficient and the service was good. The staff even came round to take group photos for us before we started on the meal. When we settled the bill, the cashier even told us to each take an ice cream from the freezer. He said with a wide smile, "On me". Go try it! A wonderful experience you won't forget
3
Had dinner here with my wife and father. We ordered a 3-tier set with an additional crab and a ginseng chicken soup base. The seafood were fresh and tasty but the crab was a lot smaller than our expectations. The ginseng chicken was tasty too. Overall, the food is acceptable but it seems to be a bit overhyped. Probably worth a visit if you have not tried it before
1
Paid close to $180 for 4 pax, the servings for shellfish, prawns and mini lobsters were quite pathetic. The soup base was tasteless and we had to pay extra money for extra ingredients like eggs and noodles. Totally not worth it. Would rather spend the money at a top lunch buffet like carousel for around the same price. Highly unrecommended
3
As there were only 3 of us, staff recommend us to take 3-tiers for 2paxs and add-on 1 more tier for other seafood. Hence, we added a small Sri Lankan crab which about 500gm and cost us about $60. Overall, seafood were fresh, from clams to crabs to oysters. However, each table only allow to occupy 1.5hrs and after which you need to return table to the next customers. I do understand their point but this limiting factors will be a super turn off!!! Imagine you are enjoying your dinner with beers and you keep looking at your watch?Do not suppose will revisit this place again since we did not receive any outstanding services eithe
1
The waiter keeps on pushing for higher price set for us. The big prawn, scallop and the oyster tastes NOT fresh at all… The kimchi soup tastes tasteless.
过于积极地推销，不新鲜的食材，无味的泡菜汤，过甜的饮料。绝不再吃第二次。
4
Seafood are fresh and tasty. Service is good.
Staffs has good knowledge of te food
Will be back for other occasions
5
Great food comes with great company. Recommend you come in big pax to enjoy more variety of seafood!
2
All I can say is that this is a place where I will not have a good meal. Food was OK and fresh. Didnt show us much service but charged us 33% service charge. The place was so cramp. I won't recommend people to come this place to eat. To prevent people from overpaying
3
Went with friends and only enjoyed the first tier from nine. All the others were quite dry. Honestly, nothing spectacular. You can get better food in many other places. It is too pricey too. Be careful with what are free and what are not from the cold shelf. You may just end up paying for more than what you bargained for. It happened to us. This is not a halal restaurant if you are Muslim
3
Went in a group, ordered the 9 tier tower. The service is good, maybe because we uses the VIP room. It has a dedicated air-conditioning which is good.Food is fresh, service is good, Dustbin cleared promptly. End up with sixty dollars gone. It's all for the hype, for steam Seafood, I can get the same quality, at a lower price else where
1
Made the reservation and mentioned the fact that we are celebrating a birthday, a gentleman called Alvin committed to arrange something special yet nothing was done. not even a sincere wish to the birthday girl. service was okay but food was disappointing. oysters especially was really bad, it's sandy/muddy and not fresh at all.i wouldn't recommend you to visit for any special occasion, wouldn't want your special day to be ruined. for a first time dining experience maybe yes, but i regretted that visit
3
staff were in a rush to get your food off the tray. with maybe 2 or 3 food left on the layer, staff will come to you and ask u to remove your food off the tray. tried to take a peek of what's underneath and one of the staff came rushing to me with a terrible attitude asking me what I want. I told him that I wanted to take a look what's the next layer and he told me in a rude way, "you want to look at what's underneath I do it okay?" food was nice but really over priced. you got to add on and add on to be full
3
Walk passed this restaurant when staying at a hotel nearby and decide to try for our lunch. Was not really crowded during Sunday noon.Ordered 5 tiers for 3 adults and 2 kids which cost $128.90. You could opt for the free flow tea at $3.90. The last layer is soup base. Foods serve quite fast but portion not very big (each tray not even full of seafood). We order a plate of maggi, a plate of fishball and a plate of hotdog with 3 free flow drinks, the total bill was almost $180.the 9 tiers cost $298.90. If you want crab, you need to top up.Overall we find is expensive for such meal

Finaly tried Captain K..worth one try, but i wont be back.- Reservation: 3 timings to choose from - 5pm, 6.30pm or 8pm. Best to get 8pm else you would be restricted to 1.5 hrs dining time. - Food: prawns, mussels and clams are really fresh. crawfish too small (though tastes good, too much effort required to peel that small crawfish just to eat it). scallops are huge, taste alright; but oysters is sandy and not that fresh. soup is good! at the end of the tiers, you wont feel full so you will definitely add stuff into the soup, which comes with additional cost (yellow plates $2/plate, not that bad though)- Drinks: plain water provided at self-service, free flow flavoured drinks @$3.80/cup. dont bother getting flavoured drinks coz they are rather diluted and not fantastic.- Price: overpriced..i think there are fresh and nice seafood elsewhere for lower price. for 4 pax 5 tiers with 2 drinks and 2 yellow plates, the total damage was $160+. hmm.- Ambience: nois

Captain K, a new Korean Seafood and Shellfish concept;Or known as "9 Layers of Steamed Shells", is the latest addition to the steamboat craze.The varieties of seafood are arranged layer by layer, from top to bottom tiers, is cooked by the steaming method. As the seafood is steamed, the origin taste and juices of the seafood are collected at the bottom tiered, giving the soup base a highly delicious and nutritious taste of buds.The Seafood Tower caters for Lunch and Dinner. Diners could opt for the 3/5/7 or 9 tiered Steamed Seafood.The seafood are mainly prawns, scallops, Squids, Shellfish, Clams, Crab, Crawfish, Blue Mussels, Crustacean, Oysters and finally the Soup Base.There are also a varieties of add-ons from the shelf:Noodles, eggs, luncheon meat, cabbage Pork/Seafood/prawn Dumplings, Cheese/Chicken Sausages, Pork Shabu Shabu, Pork Sukiyaki, Fishball with Roe, Beef Wagyu, quail eggs, etc ....There are 3 soup base to choose from: Kombu Dashi,Korean Kimchi and Korean Ginseng Chicken.There are 6 sauces to opt from :Thai Green Chili SauceKorean Soya SauceSambal Belacan SauceYuzu Miso DipSpicy Korean BeanSamjang SauceSpring onions (chopped)When the tiered are served, we cleared the first top tier first. The waitress will help to remove the emptied first layer and we proceed with the second and so on till we finally reached the soup base.Then we will drop our choice of add-ones into the soup base.It is an eye catching to dine in this way. But trust me, you will love it!Take note of their business hours :Monday : 6:00pm to 10:30pmTuesday to Thursday :12:00pm to 3:00pm6:00pm to 10:30pmFriday : 12:00pm to 3:00pm 6:00pm to 10:00pmSaturday :11:30am to 3:00pm5:00pm to 11:00pmSunday : 11:30am to 3:00pm5:00pm to 10:30pmFor Reservations, please call :65 6255 2270Address :30 Prinsep Street #01-02Income@PrinsepSingapore 188647Those who drives could park at :ERC InstituteRendezvous HotelBencoolen Hotel(Plenty of photos to follow up later as my iPad could not download them now).

Decided to celebrate brother's birthday here as he loves seafood. Ordered the 5 tiers set for 5 pax, add on 1 600+g crab (which cost around $63) + 4 food items to add into the soup. We chose the chicken soup. Can't really taste the Korean chicken soup taste, it just taste salty. Must say the seafood taste fresh..that's all. Actually it is quite bland. Dip it with the thai chilli sauce, tastier. The restaurant was very noisy! Loud music playing and many people talking. Can't really converse well while eating. It would be good to have a sink to wash hands after eating the seafood as the toilet is quite a distance away. Overall just a average experience, nothing great except the price = $283+ Not likely to come again

Despite many negative reviews that I've read on Hungry Go Where (local dining app review contributed by diners) my friends and I decided to check it out.The restaurant has drinks but the price of Makgeolli was a shocking $25/btl which is like way overpriced. You could opt for the free flow tea at $3.90 instead. While placing your orders, you'll be given the choices of different soup base, priciest being the Korean Ginseng Soup. So since we're already there, we had to give it a shot. As there were 4 of us, we chose the 7 tier tower and placed an additional order of crab. I do have to say that the food is fresh and the soup was infused with the sweetness of all the seafood that was steamed on top. The bill came to a staggering $398 which meant $100/pax. It is a little overpriced for the amount of food that we ate and I have definitely eaten fresher food with more variety for the same amount. Once would be enough and we definitely will not be going back at all

Had the set lunch for 2pax today, costs $68 with 5 diff types of seafood First layer was the clams and prawns this was very fresh and delicious 2nd later was the oysters, scallops, blue mussels and baby crayfish. As it was the end of the season the crayfish were very small. The soup base was good - I chose the konbu which was free. Have to pay extra if you want the kimchi base or the ginseng chicken soup. There was a variety of sauces I like the chilli Blachan witch goes well with the seafood. Tea and soft drinks are free flow with $3.80 per person

The concept is interesting and a dinner there is definitely a fun experience, but the food is far below average at a pretty high price. Nothing of the seafood in the tower is really tasty or of high quality. There is absolutely no service in this restaurant - it is a help yourself mix of of fast food and restaurant. The soup in the steamboat was good, but the available items again far below average. Overall I can not recommend this restaurant for it's food and would not go there again

Join the bandwagon of trying out this stacking high seafood tower. There are 6 of us, chosen the ginseng chicken soup which comes with half a skinny chicken at the base layer. The idea is for the stacking high seafood soup juice to drip all the way down making the base soup yummy. Enjoyed the fresh lala, mussels, good sized prawns, a mini version of crayfish lookalike, squid stuffed with rice, oysters and we added a Sri Lanka crab. They have a sauce bar where u can pick ur own dip eg Thai Chilli, miso, balachan, Korean sauce. Ala carte add on items can be added as u like like meat slices and instant noodles. They provide free flow drinks at a price and ice water. Overall was a good dining experience but be warned that you will smell of seafood when u leave the place. However, it cost us a whopping 300+ for 6 of us. This amount to approx 50+ each, for this price we could indulge in a pretty good zi char. But then again it's a good dining experience to try it out especially the seafood are really fresh

I was here for lunch with friends and a big bunch of them actually. Enough for me to try out their ultimate 9 layers, because anything less you will miss out of some of the better dishes. The 9 layers are briefly : Lobsters (2 full cut in 4), prawns, Mini crayfish, Oysters, Scallops with Rice sticks, Rice stuffed in cuttlefish, crams and shells, horned crab and finally the soap right below. The secret is letting the 8 layers of seafood drips their juices all the way down to the soap so that it taste really good. Firstly, the seafood is pretty fresh. Well, its NOT the BEST seafood I ever tasted, but its not bad. The prawns are taste and the mini crayfish is something new, just not really worth it though. The lobsters might have been a bit overcooked though as it sticks to the shell (or not fantastic fresh maybe). The Rice in cuttlefish is definitely one of the better dish along with the Scallop which I think is the best of all. Ok, the bad part. This place is really costly. The 9 layer itself is almost $300 after all the plus plus and in fact, not told to us, the drinks are not really FREE. It cost $3.50 per head and I think its just a bit canny for them to keep that untold and eventually charging that. On top of that, the soup part is basically useless, unless you are thinking of drinking a whole pot of kimchi soap. And other soups required additional charges. So you will end up getting noodles, or luncheon meats etc, which are really where the killing are. The noodles are like $2 or $3 per piece and the luncheon meat is $3 for one layer. Not exactly economical, but by the time you reach the last layer and is not full, you got to get something.Other than being costly, the place is pretty good, the food is good, but parking is also a terrible thing. So plan where you are going to park, because its going to be quite a walk anyway

While its seafood is definitely fresh but at a pricey levelThey charged us 4 towels though we ordered a 5-tier (meant for 4 pax), we have had a tough job in deciding should we go for a 3-tier (meant for 2pax) but add on S$15 for the Korean ginseng chicken in their last tier of soup or some other noodles/fishballs insteadWe wanted to add a crab but it s at least 800g heavy, that means we have to pay much more $10 for a 100g X 8 just to add on a crab...hence we dropped the idea and opted for 5 tier instead but that is abit too much for 3 men too(it s prawn is S$8.80 per piece! stated on its website - not sure is this a typo)While it comes w Oyster and better scallops (4 ea)... I felt the smaller sized clams and mussels are overly too many even if it is meant for 4-5paxWhile the scallops comes with the vermicelli, I felt the taste was not well-blended, although the condiments that was placed with scallop is quite well-doneCalling them to make a reservation was very challenging as no one seemed to pick up even after peak period like 3.35pm onwards, shouldn't have wasted time calling as I patronised them on a sunday, not all the tables are occupiedNote: free flow of water and kimchibut good to supply some (Korean) dessert

I Was there for a farewell party for departing colleague. We ordered two 9-tier seafood combination. Also ordered two crabs. First tier started with mussels that were pretty fresh and soft. As it was 9-tiers, so everyone need to stand and reach for the food. The 'mini lobsters' were also special. One just need to remove its head and tail, use a metal chopstick to push the flesh out to consume it. The skid was stuffed with spicy rice cooked with heibi hiam. Love the scallops served with glass noodles. As each tier was removed, the soup was poured downwards. So you can imagine the bottom-most tier will contain the essence of each kind of seafood. We added instant noodle, vegetable and sausages to the 'essence' soup. Tried both the normal and spicy soup. They also have free flow drinks but liquor is chargeable. The boss was kind enough to offer us free ice-creams after the scrumptious meal

We ordered the 5-tier as there were only 4 of us.The top tier had prawns, followed by clams and mussels, then some sort of small crawfish (a little difficult to eat), and last tier had scallops and oysters. The bottom-most tier was the korean kimchi soup base.Liked the prawns and scallops most! Very fresh!For the soup, we added some instant noodles, cabbages, spam, wagyu beef slices and enoki mushrooms to complete the meal! These additions are charged separately (based on the colour of the plate, similar to conveyor sushi).The seafood itself was not filling (unless you order more tiers for lesser people) so the additions for the soup base is a must!Good attentive service from the staff

Seafood served at the freshest at a reasonable price. This restaurant features quality premium seafood at its best original form - steamed! Definitely recommended!

As a whole, i should say that the seafood is nicely done and quite fresh. But the soup base is too salty for my liking. We took the seaweed soup with 9 tier n end up too salty. Will not recommend for this soup base.

Have been to Captain K several times and each time they never fail to impress me with their service and friendliness. I would describe the experience as 'Fun, enjoyable and great experience for first timer'.I have tried the 5-layers and the 7-layers. The quality of the varieties of seafood is consistent and properly cooked - just right. It taste very good as I do like food cooked in their original juices. There are also enough variety of sauces for you to chose from for those who needs the extra punch of flavors.However, be prepared to smell after you leave the restaurant..

The group of us had the tower for 6pax and it was literally towering over us. It was a fun experience and the seafood was pretty fresh.Wish that they had advise us to keep some of the seafood for the mini steamboat right at the bottom tho. The kimchi based was a bit week th

Relatively new restaurant with an interesting concept. Five of us ordered 7 layers seafood tower which comprises 6 different kinds of seafood and a pot of ginseng chicken soup at the base. There are plates of vegetables , dumplings , noodles .... to add to the soup. Very much like Korean army stew concept. A "create your own sauce and dip "station with paring guides for each type of seafood. Fresh seafood , fast and friendly service. Will visit again

Fantastic place for seafood lovers and friends gathering - very interesting concept of dining with multi tiered food waiting for diners to clear one level after the other. Fun place for friends/colleagues gathering. Visited on 31May2016But the cost is not so friendly - you really have to be mindful of what you are adding in orders to the seafood tower. The alaskan crab are charged by weight as with all other additional orders - could easily sum up to few hundreds dollars. You must check on the weight that you are order to avoid blowing up your bill. Our group is 4 pax (3 ladies one guy) cost $322. The soup base after all the levels are cleared was very thick and salty - best to avoid boiling the steamboat food

Heard about this place and went for dinner. We are a group of 8 and since we have reservation we do not need to wait, there was a queue outside. Suggest that it's better to reserve. We ordered the 7 layers seafood and it had almost every thing except for crabs and lobster We ordered another round of prawns and also we had noodles, vegetables and meat balls Overall a new way to eat seafood (steamed) and with different sauces available. Free flow of Drinks Like tea and lemonade at $3 per person There is a private room for up to 14 pax w min spending of $600Will go back again

Dined there with friends yesterday night around 9pm. We were a party of 4, so we ordered the 5 tier seafood tower. Food was served promptly after orderong. The seafood came out fresh and yummy even if just having it steamed, it was perfect actually & food portion was enough to go about. The kimchi soup base at the end was AMAZING.. so so so flavourful!! Previously before dining there we read a few reviews mentioning that the waiting time was crazy long for a table or food + food not enough, and honestly we were abit worried that it could happen to us too. But I think from my experience yesterday- Captain K has definately improved, everyone should give it a chance and try it out! Good job captain K! We will be bac

7 of us visited last night, we made a reservation for 8pm dinner. We reached there at 8pm, attendant said there were clearing a few tables, please wait for awhile. We waited till 830pm, attendant came and explain the menu to us. We refused to take the lobster set, we ordered one without lobsters and snow crab and picked Sri Lanka crab a la carte order instead.Except for the crab, clam, mussels and prawns tiers (some ppl get to eat 2). Scallop, oyster, squid, each of us just get to eat one piece. (All are so smalllllll)Side order for steamboat will be $2-4 per plate for your additional steamboat food. Soup is free. (Seaweed and kimchi base)Sri Lanka crab cost $9.87 per 100g. It is very expensive to me, and first time I see such a small Sri Lanka crab. We ordered 3 crabs for 7 of us. Everyone get to eat two small pieces. The crab is really small.During CNY Jumbo seafood was $8.8/100g, uncle Leong seafood $6.6/100g, their crabs are pretty big and full of meat. But not is not CNY, captain k selling $9.8, which is $98 per kg.Everything is steam here, no special favors in them. It just that they provided sauces for you to go with, Thai sauce, belacan, yuzu and so on. Food served different from the photos they have on their website too. I don't see panda bun, comes together with the squid rice. The food are so so. Buy your own and steam from home are so much cheaper.Our bill ended up $550+, service charge and tax already $77.Each of us paid $73 for this meal, seafood didn't make us feelfull, but steamboat the side order, korean noodle, sausages, dumplings, mushrooms, vegetables free flow of water ($3) did.bdont think they are opened by the korean, the food has no taste from korean style.My suggestion to you is try out happy crab, BBQ crab in kopitiam if you really like plain cooking, savor the real crab meat from the nature. 600 - 700g per crab cost $40.Start living! Save money for good food

we paid more than $200 for a 7-tier seafood tower. We dont know where is the switch and assumed that someone would have turn it on for us when they placed the tower on the table-stove. in the end, the food served was cooked, but cold. which makes us wonder and doubt the freshness of the seafood.the seafood quality is not bad, but definitely did not justify with its price. They sell maggie-mee instant noodles for $2 a block. The soupbase at the end we chose kimchi, i believe its just MSG from the instant noodles they bought. i dont like the way they do business, your customers are not idiots.and is this suppose to be korean? totally have no korean feel at all.the only plus point is the scallops and prawns, the rest was mediocre. 5 people with 7-tier tower(suppose to be for 6 people) $200+ $40/person we are still quite hungry. Dont waste your money, JUMBO seafood tastes better
