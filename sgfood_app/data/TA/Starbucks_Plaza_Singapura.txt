I ordered a set of pancakes and a cup of Espresso while was waiting for my friend to come.
Cakes were a bit too sweet but going well with the coffee.

24 hour cafe with large settings. Great place to have supper or a snack after your late night movies.

We went here for a drink after shopping in the mall great to sit down and have a cool refreshing drink and a small feed great fast service and good place to sit and watch people shopping.

We had afternoon tea here, can never go past Star Bucks for a cold drink and some cake. Quality was good.

Enjoyed a nice afternoon coffee, a bonus in singapore is free wifi not so easy to find. A great place to relax out of he heat.

I requested for my drink to be less sweet and they really did it to my standard. Some places could not achieve it and the drinks would still be quite sweet. Really love the service here too. Thank you Starbucks, PS!

Have grabbed a coffee here on numerous occasions in the past 18 months or so.Today I had a large cappuccino around mid-day before meeting a friend for a late lunch nearby.Service is dictated by the queue - today it was busy and took around 10 minutes from ordering until being ready. Staff were efficient and seemed to enjoy their job.Sat down inside, enjoying the cappuccino while I watched the hustle & bustle of the mall and Orchard Rd.Not a bad spot for a coffee

What I loved about this Starbucks was its location in the shopping centre and it's awesome layout which enables you to have a beautiful coffee and sit up over looking the very busy shopping mall. Was a great experience, very clean coffee was perfect and staff are super friendly

The location and service is quite good, efficient and friendly. I was in a hurry and needed a quick bite. I generally try to eat something more healthy and substantial than the pastries and baked goods they offer.I tried the chicken and vegie wrap for the first time, it was a quite a decent size portion and reasonably priced. I will be back for that meal if i get caught out and in need of a quick bite

This particular outlet of Starbuck is Huge, like literally huge. It was September 2016 when I was in SGP for a office conference when I visited. We were out shopping and decided to grab a bite here. Since the outlet was huge they had plenty of items to savor. We were 3 of us and hence ordered Chicken Pie, Curry Chicken Puff, Chicken Fold over, New York Cheese cakes for the food and for drinks we had Java chip Frappuccino.The store was really packed with teenagers and office goers alike, but there was no dearth of space. It offered free wi-fi and perhaps that was a added advantage. This way or that way My Love for Starbucks remain irrespective of the fact if I stay in India or visit abroad

Good coffee and friendly baristas! Sean L and the Coffee Master (female Chinese) were very friendly and patient even though the cashier system was rather slow... However, this place is rather crowded even during non-peak hours.

its always a new experience to drink coffee at starbucks becuase you get a different feeling of drinking it there.

Went twice for breakfast, plus just to have a coffee. Very popular. Nice place to people watch. Clean. Lots of people go there. Ordering is efficient. On busy times the staff need to be quicker with cleaning.

I like the lattee with cake and muffins. The environment is clean with friendly staffs. The music is nice and not too loud

Starbucks produce the same consistent coffee. I tend to get an extra shot as I find it a bit weak. It is great that you get free wifi makes it relaxing to sit enjoy a coffee & surf. It would be nice to get a few healthy option to eat.

Had ordered two cups of drinks to share among four at a table, but a service staff (the manager) was rude and sarcastic who insisted that every person was to buy a drink or we would have to leave. I would have appreciated it if she had sought our understanding and explained to us politely that every one who sits within the store has to buy a drink. There would be no problem getting two more drinks, but her service attitude left a very bad taste. The staff could definitely benefit from some training. P/S: It was during a non-peak hour where half the seats were empty

The produce is always the same in a Starbucks so you know what to expect.Service at this branch, however, can be improved. There are a lot of people behind the counter but there is always a huge queue. Some employees are really good and seem to be the ones running the entire place. The majority, however, are slow and look like they could do with some training.They have a large seating area though were you can relax. And the interior is also very easy on the eye

A long way to go to get anywhere near Starbucks service.130pm Nov 27th - Ordered a Latte, waited 10min while others were served first.Asked the barrista what happened but too busy to pay attention.Asked for a refund and the 3 girls at the counter gave my back my money without an apology.When i asked them what they thought of the situation no opinion, 3 dumfounded looks, no apology.I know Singapore doesnt aspire to excellent service but think Starbucks should do a little training to at least come a little closer the the way better service received in malaysia or indonesia

I spend half my business life at this wonderful Starbucks in Equity Plaza. I love meeting clients here and they often choose to meet here rather than in their offices as it's a great atmosphere to do business in. Neutral ground where we both can relax and talk about business and beyond.The staff here are also the best in Singapore, always smiling, always happy to help.Just a great business venue to do business
