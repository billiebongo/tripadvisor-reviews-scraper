Hidden along at a nondescript shop house along Haji lane, Shin Gi Tai is a cocktail bar on the second floor. Owner/Bartender, Anthony Chung makes a mean Negroni and Yakuza bad boy, but it was his Shiso Gimlet which was special. There are no menus, and he mixes drinks on your preferences. Lovely quiet joint.DO: make reservations, as Anthony has a strict no standing policy

Unpretentious, cozy and fronted by a bartender with a dry sense of humour, Shin Gi Tai is the perfect hideaway bar for introverts. There's no menu but the bar specialises in classic cocktails and Anthony, the owner/bartender, can pretty much make any drink you want. Shin Gi Tai has now moved to Haji Lane - when facing 7-11, the door is on the right. Pro tip: go on a weekday
