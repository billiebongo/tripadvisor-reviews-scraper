We happened upon this local restaurant and ordered the sambal pomfret and the prawn rolls. It met our expectations and we will return for another seafood dinner.

One of our regular haunts over many years. Great local scene. We ALWAYS get the same, balachan pomfret, black pepper crayfish. Carlsberg with ice. Service for Ang moh can be spotty but worth the wait.

Go for the sambal fish and black pepper cray fish. Its one of my fav place to go after returning from europe or america. Never fail the freshness test. Consistent good food after so many years. Highly recommended!!!

I know they're known for their sambal fish but the fried baby quid was my absolute favorite! It's a locals place in a residential area, kind of out of the way but it's worth it. The chili and black pepper crabs are great as well

Had a delicious lunch with colleagues. Their sambal pomfret is fried to the right texture, there is a thick layer of sambal spread on top but the spicness is not over whelming.

My wife wanted to eat sambal blachan fish - something she had in 1980's. Found this restaurant through google. A very simple restaurant, good fast service and helpful staff. Not very impressed with the food - the fish was over fried. Felt prices very slightly higher considering one can get same cuisine in better location, better overall decor. Don't think will come bac

This was my second visit to this shop for it balachan promfret fish and other. The previous visit was in 2015, which I found that the balachan chilli was spicy for us. This time, I believe the chef had reduce the hotness. It tasted better. We finished the meat and the chilli with the plain rice. Yummy.

We wanted to try the local delicacy, chilli crab, and luckily this little joint was right across the road from our hotel. We wandered in on a Saturday night and we were the only westerners: a good sign eh?. Ordered the chilli crab and their special, sambal pomphret. We were tempted by the black pepper crayfish (another special of theirs) but glad we didn't order it too as the crab and fish were more than enough for the two of us. We had a beer, too. In total it came to about SGD $100 which was very reasonable considering the amount of food. Highly recommended

My boyfriend and I got 2 main meals for 8 dollars (less than Â£4!) with the seafood noodles!Not a great selection of drink-coke or lemonade for non alcoholic options.Couldn't see any desserts on the menu either.Also presentation made me worry-just plastic chairs and plastic bag tablecloth!Couldn't see the hygeine ratimg either.But then an old lafy came out from the kitchen area smiling with a hot plate of soy sauce and prawn noodles.Very tasty
