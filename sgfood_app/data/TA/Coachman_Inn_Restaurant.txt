Not many places in Singapore can boast of absolute sea frontage, sea breeze, superb ambience and fine dining.

Dine by the sea...beautiful and relaxing atmosphere. Open to the public for lunch and dinner everday. Dont come on weekends as the club will be crowded with it's sailing members

Ordered the ribeye steak well done. It came with carrots, broccoli and French fries. Sauce was garlic sauce which the steak can do without as the steak tasted good even without the sauce. Broccoli would have tasted better without the butter. French fries were good and crispy. Really loved the steak which was not dry although well done.

It would be worth going there just for the location: by the sea and with a view.There is a small breeze which cools a bit the warm outside and there are some fans on the ceiling too.The menu offers a wide selection of fish, seafood, meat, noodles and rice, so everyone can find satisfaction there.Good selection of drinks, typically one can enjoy a fresh coconut and or a cool beer!A good break away from the office or a pleasant change from the airconditioned restaurant

Took our supplier out for early dinner and found this on the internet ( near our last appointment ) and it was quite nice. it has open air feel with good view of planes landing at CIA. Cooking is interesting but did not try my favourites ( sting ray / fish head curry etc ) since my guests has allegries: what a pity...Prices for both F&B are moderate so it can be a nice day at the beach

Had lunch here with friends and everyone was very pleased with their meal. The service was good and it's nice to sit and watch all the boats while you dine. The menu is very extensive and includes Chinese, Western, Indian, & different local dishes. Prices are reasonable

In the past two months my wife and I have dined thrice at the restaurant, which is in the Changi Sailing Club itself and overlooks the beach and the boardwalk. Public transport will get you to Changi Village, from which it is a 15-20 minute walk. Better to drive or take a taxi.The staff have been extremely obliging and courteous. The restaurant was not crowded, even on a weekend.The seafood is excellent. We had the sambal stingray each time we came. Yesterday we also tried the grilled sotong (squid). Both were excellent. They also do a very good fish maw soup as well as a crabmeat and sweet corn soup.The Hainanese pork chop was disappointing, being thin and overly seasoned with tomato sauce. The black pepper venison is quite good, as is the Thai pork ribs. Generally, the local dishes are better than the Western ones.We brought foreign friends and they enjoyed the food and the ambience. There are very few places left in Singapore where one can have a view of the sea right at one's feet while eating. All in all, worth a visit

Excellent service by Jacklyn. Jacklyn speaks great English n mandarin. She anticipates well. Wished we were given a bigger table when requested. There were 4 of us but 6 dishes, not enough space on table. Restaurant should be flexible when quiet. Food quality is excellent. Definitely one of our favorite restaurants now. View fantastic.v breezy.

Not many know that this restaurant is open to public and it's quite inaccessible without a car.However, you get to enjoy western and asian food at reasonable prices, plus the view is great for the reasonable price!The food is reminiscence of the food cooked by old hainanese chef of yesteryears. I think it's still the old chef cooking
