There was a ala-carte buffet promotion for weekday dinners, at 50% discount. The food is great, well served and worth every cent. The service is good too with friendly and helpful staff.

Had the best Cantonese Christmas Brunch ever. Very nice ambience and great service. You gotta try this place üëçüëçüëçüòÅ

We were here for the extended family dinner to celebrate a birthday. The service was great and the staff very prompt and polite; we appreciated the special touch they added with the customized birthday wishes on the menu. They initially had one instrumental song on loop forever in our room until we asked someone to vary it. I feel like the food quality could have been better, especially in comparison to what we had at this restaurant before. To my surprise, the quantity served was also slightly smaller for a typical sit-down Chinese restaurant meal. Overall, the value for money could have been improved. Friendly tip: save on the wet napkins ($1 each) and any fruit juice ($7.50)

We arrived quite late for the lunch session but the restaurant was very accommodating - we had found this in our Lonely Planet guide but it‚Äôs located in a office building which was a bit confusing to get into! We struggled to work out the menu and the staff weren‚Äôt really able to explain too many choices but that was our fault for not knowing the language! The food was presented immaculately and I wish we‚Äôd ordered more of the dumplings and starters as these were tasty. The views were spectacular but the seats near them seemed to be reserved.

I went with my family..2 adults and 3 kids.The staff said only cny menu is available .Everything on the menu is very expensive..we ordered roast meat plate.. seafood pot and fried rice Staff said it's not enough suggested beef..and when veeg arrived it's 2 very small palm sized wagyu beef that costed us $100.Our Bill came up to $565..without dessert!! This is ridiculous! Pls be warned.. never visit peach garden during chinese new year! It's A RIPPED-OFF

Please do not visit this restaurant they will cheat you ! Whatever you ordered and the items delivered are totally different . They will make sure you pay a bomb ! Ordered a fish but served you 2 fishes so that you pay more ( since seafood will be more expensive ) . Ordered Cha Siew , rostered pork , duck and they will serve you additional suckling pig ! ( pay more again) . You ordered Tang Yuan and being served Tang Yuan with Ba Bao Tea ( again cost you more) . They just want to earn more revenue during CNY! Lastly , they don‚Äôt repeat your order so when you think everything was in order that‚Äôs totally wrong !!!!!

Made reservations for 2nd day of Chinese New Year (CNY) for a big group n I specifically asked them if they serve dim sum. I had stressed we mainly wished to have dim sum. I was told they do. The staff failed to say they only serve a CNY dim sum menu with only 8 items. Out of which half of them were overpriced items with abalone and stuff. Main dishes also offer limited Chinese New Year items only. It was difficult to even place order as all the items were so expensive. We were happy when the staff recommended Claypot rice. After all, if the noodle is $74, Claypot rice sounds innocent enough. We were shocked when we saw the bill $176 for just the Claypot rice. Inside the Claypot is only rice, some vegetables and a few pieces of Chinese sausage. A total rip off. I should add our lunch of 4 types of dim sum, 1 vegetable dish, 1 noodle, 1 Claypot rice and 1 whole chicken cost $750 for 13 people. I truly wonder how can anyone be satisfied with such an order and such a bill.After visiting this restaurant a few times, I feel the management instills in their staff to push n trap diners into ordering expensive items. To the point it is very annoying and unethical. They keep pushing their drinks too. Today I witnessed it as the waitress asked the young adults at the table a few times to order soft drinks even though they already said no. Previously they had urged my 11 year Old niece while we adults were not at the table to order apple juice. I said "urged" because the waitress had asked her 3 times even though she had said no earlier. The little kid gave in and that glass cost about $10+++!! Such sneaky business ethics totally kill the dining experience. So what if the restaurant decor is nice? It seems to me the management only thinks of making money and not keeping customers. Such a total disappointment. Today was the last draw. My family will definitely not patronize any Peach Garden again

This is a 4 star* hotel with the Peach Garden restaurant, serving Chinese fares specialising in DIM SUM. The food is acceptable but unexpecting, the DIM SUM are of the usual range and quality acceptable. There is a promotion currently on selected DIM SUM items to attract diners. The ambience is good. The staff are friendly and good. There is a staff, Md MAGGIE WONG, who is exceptionally GOOD and accord very GOOD and Friendly service to the guests !!! The location is good and near the CHINATOWN area. Try it if you are around the area. BON APPETTI !!

Had ala carte lunch buffet, the varieties were okay, food tasted not bad too.But the down side is that the serving size is not standardize/well proportioned.The service is quite subjective too.Experience bad service from this lady (I do not know her name).FIrstly, we requested 5pax portion of drunken prawns, the amount given seems to be 2-3pax only. Hence for the 2nd round, we requested for 6pax, but the portion given was more of less the same as the first time. Thus, the last round, we requested to be 2x portion of the amount that they had previously served us. (since they always give 2-3pax portion, by requesting 2x portion, we are expecting 6pax portions)She quickly gave a "rude" reply: are you sure you can finish it...?And, she took out 1 big pot of drunken prawns (like for 10pax). If for the very first portion, she took that pot out, we all probably can finish it, but this is already our third serving.We quickly feedback to the manager and lucky the manager did change the pot serving to a big plate serving only.Additionally, they have 2 time slot for lunch, so it was a bit rush to finish our food.Overall, the food tasted not bad, just the service a bit subjective, the atmosphere was not very good too, a lot of big groups of families (causing a lot of noises in the restaurant)

Sorry to say peach garden has slowly changed from good to bad. Reservation taken was unable to seat me (with family of kids) at the promised time. Fine, we were seated finally after roaming around 15 minutes in the hotel. There comes a captain (should be in my thought, an order taker) who run me down all food I ordered by telling me it could be 2-3 items not available but not sure yet. The dinner started with appetizers but followed by mains and forgotten about roasted duck and daily soup until we were pretty full and realized that these are not served yet and in fact, we are full already. Then the daily soup served and I‚Äôll need to oozed it down as I was drinking dessert soup and left me no choice, I just packed the roasted duck back home (as maybe tomorrow breakfast ?) I couldn‚Äôt bother to even snap a picture because my kids were really starving after running around in the hotel and they were drinking lots of water after the meal, not sure if MSG or chicken powder kicked it ?? As I said, it has changed from service to food quality. Think twice if you‚Äôre going for ala-carte; go ahead if you aimed for buffet dinner at this outlet

We had the soup of the day, baby lobster ( which came with nothing else on the plate) so ordered a plate of fried rice to share which was nice but cost $28.00. Bill total $140 (for 2 of us) and we left still hungry.

After many years of patronising Peach Garden @Novena and now Havelock Road, the Chef and team continue to offer Quality Food / Excellent Service. Kudos to all!!

The good stuff are all miniature. Mini abalone, mini scallop, mini everything... Yes buffet but with the good stuff so mini.... I don't know what else we are paying for? it is so mini that it is an understatement. You are talking about smaller than 5cent coin kind of mini

This is not the first time my family enjoy a meal in this restaurant. Today, we came because of the 50% discount promotion for buffet a la carte that is valid till 30 Jan 2018. The food is delicious. We care that our food is not too salty or oily as we're all in our 50s & 60s. And the food is just right in its salt and oil content, except the dishes with salted eggs. Every table is occupied by families/friends dining together. The waiters were not flustered despite the (probably quite demanding) crowd! All dishes we ordered received a thumbs up, except the drunken chicken - tasteless!

Celebrated my youngest son's 27th Birthday recently at Peach Garden / Miramar Hotel. Manager is Mr. Daren / Ms. Lily was very kind to e-mail me the Alacarte Buffet Menu prior to reservation. Promotion of 50% Buffet Discount till end January '18. Price for Monday to Thursday @ $24 (Buffet) + $2.80 (Tea) + $1.20 (Towel) per pax + 2 x Pickles ($4 each) + 10% Service +7 % Tax. (Ban Heng only charges $2 for Tea/Pickle/Towel per pax.) Penalty of $5 per 100g wastage charge.Menu has 38 dishes - only one soup (from 1 - 5) can be selected once ! The Superior Shark Fin (can see a big piece of shark fin) with Crab Meat , Deep Fried Soon Hock, Drunken Prawns, Deep Fried Pawns with Wasabi Cream are excellent - our favourites. Not to be missed: Steamed Pa Ting Fish (nice), Prawns with Jack Fruit Sauce, Fried Salmon Skins with Salted Egg (Tung Lok's better) , Stir Fried Pepper Beef, Spare Ribs, Beancurd with Mushrooms etc. Unable to select more dishes because the "small" portions are "generous". Deserts: Chilled Coconut, Chilled Mango Sago with Pomelo (nice), Warm Black Glutinous Rice, Chilled Coconut Milk Red Bean Pudding.Restaurant was packed because of 50% promotion. The staff are friendly and plates are changed a few times. Food delivery also spaced out / no rush.Value for money with the 50% promotion at $35 per pax (from bill). Will be very expensive without promotion

There was a promotion, minimum 4 pax, with 50 pct off. We booked 4 tables on a weekday night. The restaurant was packed, food service was slow. The food was buffet standard except the steam fish, steam prawns, wasabi prawns and the deep fried fish. The korobuta pork was hard and tasteless, the Char Siew was epic.. tiny pieces and all with bones on each piece, wondering why they have it on the menu. The sago mango and the black glutinous rice desserts were watery. Drunken chicken were tiny pieces all with skin. Can‚Äôt find shark fin in the shark fin soup even though you can order only one portion per person. Was expecting whole scallops with French bean .. but it just really tiny pieces. The list could go on. Even on promotion cost around $40 per pax including taxes and tea. Don‚Äôt think I will visit again. Expected better food from Peach Garden.

On the 24 November 2017, my sister reserved for 35 seats which is spread out to 3 tables at this Restaurant for the sit down Chinese Buffet Dinner. The Restaurant was very packed but service was prompt and efficient. As soon as we sit down, the waiting staff immediately take our beverages order. Every table is place with the menu card, all we need to do is just tick whatever choices of food we prefer and give it to the waiter. Food served was much under par as compared to that as stated in menu, For example, desserts were very much watered down, char siew was served with char siew rib bones, plain vegetable with no garnishings as claimed. Its a restaurant to satisfy simple hungry folks but not for food Connosieurs' palates. However its still value for money, an economical eat !

We heard about the Promotion (min 4 pax) and decided to have a try, for Peach Garden has good reputation in Chinese Culinary This outlet is conveniently located at the Hotel Miramar along Havelock Road. A queue already build up before 5:30pm and reservation is a must, so good luck to those who drop by adhoc.The menu is comprehensive and interesting enough. We were rather quick in placing our order for almost every dish of interest, a little before other tables completed theirs. But do note they have a $5/100gfor food wastage charge. Food was prompt and arrived hot. Just like other TA comment; we can only order the 1 portion per pax soup. As appertiser we ordered the chilled fresh scallop with fruits/mango. The SoonHock fried fish was the more interesting one, the garlic sauce was just perfect. The deep-fried fresh prawn with wasabi was interesting, portion was generous. The handmade beancurd was bland..also large portion, Cannot finish, haha.The Japanese kurobuta pork cutlet . Surprisingly large portion! But the marinated meat is too light to our liking. Lack the oomph‚Ä¶pityThe better dish of the night goes to Salad smoked duck. But the portion was really small only about 8 slices but tasted good with mayo.In addition we also ordered spinach noodles, it came abit ‚Äòhard‚Äô so we did not quite enjoy.The service is okay but do expect to wait when all the tables are seated, usual during rush hours. Billing wise; with the promo price 50% it still came up to about $40/pax after including the with towel tea and peanut.. Really not value for money, quite disappointing, good only for a try

Peach Garden is conveniently located at the 3/F of Hotel Miramar along Havelock Road. They offer a lot of great tasting dishes coupled with great promos. You can taste a wide variety by ordering the small dishes first. Most of the dishes are sumptuous. It is best to allot more time to enjoy more food. Will definitely look forward to coming back again and again. Hoping next time buffet has no min pax required so I can go back there as often as I want even if we are only 2 or I am only alone

We booked a table for 9 for buffet dinner on 5 Nov at 8pm (second seating). Service staff told us to move it to 815pm due to the crowd. We arrived by 825pm and started to make orders. By 850pm (just a mere 30mins later), we were told that it was the LAST ORDER, and that the kitchen was closing and we need to make our last order. We had only had one round of food by then. Of cos we asked the restaurant manager what‚Äôs going on, halfway speaking to her, she walked off abruptly and told a waitress to attend to our queries. Waitress repeated that we had to make last order and hurried us to do so. We had a table of 9, even if we wanted to, we needed some time to decide what to eat for the rest of the entire evening. We debated with the waitress to give us more time, but she was pushing us for orders. When she realized we were really mad at this point, she agreed to come back at 930pm to ask us if we had any last orders. She came back by 915pm and hurried us once again. We had to even put in dessert orders for 9 pax when we had barely started. After ordering reluctantly, the food came in differing portions; some huge portions, others just a small plate. As we eat, the waitresses came around to clear our plates hastily. With all the movement and food coming out in weird portions, we literally swallowed our food whole. It was the most terrible of all dining experience. At this point, if you think that‚Äôs the worst it can get, you are wrong. We noticed that one of the porcelain plates had a few chipped corners. That means we could run the risk of having glass pieces in our food and mouth! I had to tell the waitress to throw that plate away before someone ends up biting into glass and injuring themselves. Of cos while this happened, there were clearing of plates and gobbling of food, accompanied by the silly faces of waiting staff around our table.Suddenly in the midst of the mayhem, one of the waitress spill dessert onto my sister‚Äôs dress. She quickly passed on at tissue to help clean up. No one else came to make better the situation. We were fuming mad by this point. A good 15mins later, someone wearing a blazer came by and apologize and offered to wash the dress for my sis. Seriously. What would she wear while cleaning was done. Blazer guy told my sis to wear the waitress‚Äôs uniform while they wash the dress. Was he trying to be funny or serious I still cant be sure, but tell me which is worst? My sis rejected him flat obviously. He then offered to pay for laundry costs after deliberation. If you are wondering wheres the bill, they shoved it at us immediately after we made the last order. Bill came up to be about $370 for 9 pax, this was after a 50% discount!!! Quality of food was meh,5/10. My grandma was with us, she‚Äôs wheelchair bound and we had to feed her hastily which was not good. I ended up with indigestion later in the evening. And of cos our after dinner plan was shelved because the mood was just blah. If this is the service level for 50% buffet offer, please do not offer it again. I‚Äôm sure customers will not compromise on dining experience. We haven always been a fan of Peach Garden at Thomson, this one killed it for us.

There is a promotion for a la carte buffet going on now till nov 17, it‚Äôs super worth it, if 4 or
More diners, there will be 50 percent . The food quality and service is Super good.

Attended a family dinner at Peach Garden recently and was amazed at the cosy private rooms offered by the restaurant. Although the food was not excellent. they were sufficent to fill the tummy.

We dined at this restaurant with a Singaporian friend. Chinese restaurant of good quality end wide choice. Great service.

went there for buffet dinner on last Sat night.
delicious and fresh food
service staff are nice too. especially the staff named Ng Sew Huat, very friendly. ü§ó

Food is relatively fresh and the portion served is just nice. Good if there is at least 4 pax to be able to enjoy the wide variety of food on the menu.
Price is also affordable.
3
The restaurant has standard ambience. The food is average but expensive. Overall in my opinion, I would not visit again because there is nothing to shout about regarding the food but is v. pricy given the quality of dishes.

A group of 9 of us had Tim Sum here this afternoon. The restaurant is offering 50% off for all its Tim Sum items on Mon-Sat and 30% on Sunday. It has quite wife selection and food taste quite good. Would recommend people to try their Tim Sum here during promotion period. One complain though is that they serve our orders almost at one go, and hence some dishes are a bit lukewarm. Overall, however, would still come back. Parking at the hotel is also easy.

We went for the discounted buffet for 4. As we were tucked in a corner of a private room, service was terrible. To avoid further headaches, we ordered every dish of interest immediately. The portions came out huge, more suitable for a table of 10 than for 4! The threat of $5/100g wastage charge and some inedible dishes made the meal most unpleasant. The prawns with jackfruit sauce and wasabi sauce were ok (obviously pre-cooked and not hot from the wok). The deep fried fish with soy sauce was the only dish worth eating. The rest of the dishes, including drunken chicken, korobuta pork, pepper beef, tofu (2 types) were simply dreadful. Even the salted egg fish skin was awful.

My last visit to their dinner buffet was in March 2017. Less than half a year, service of staff and quality of food dropped tremendouslyMy colleagues and I reached 5 mins before 6pm, and were told to come back in 15mins times as they are not set up yet. *Roll eye* buffet starts at 6pm, HELLO! So we went to the lounge at the ground to wait, and came back at 615pm. Upon usher to our table and given the ordering sheet, we ordered the 1 portion per pax soup, some of the dishes we ordered 2 or 3 portions. Yet when dishes are served, we were only served 1 portion after ordering 2-3 portions.The staff asked us order again after being served of the first portion. Is it a buffet? My previous visit , the staff had always given us what we ordered. The staff were so reluctant to give us what we have ordered.When the drunkard prawn, the soup was not hot and prawns were not fresh. Obviously it was not cooked on the spot, as the serving bowl was hot but soup was not. Yet we were the 1 and only table at that time so no reason why the food is served not hot. But we didnt complaint the first time round, so we ordered again to give them another chance. Yet both drunkard prawns and Ondo curry prawns were served not hot again. So we told the staff Lin Bi Yin that the two dishes are not hot. And guess what is her reply??? She said dont ask me , ask the chef. Ok, what kind of attitude from a service staff. Another staff overheard and approached our table took our dishes to the kitchen. When we were served two dishes back again, the food were still not hot. seems like they are microwave or something.Ordered spinach noodles, and the noodles were so soggy. how to eat?Only good point is the fried prawn balls were fresh.Will not recommend anyone to dine here. bad attitude from service staff, food quality of foo

Went for 50% lunch ala carte buffet promo on sat and we took the 2nd batch time which was 1.15pm. Very disappointed with the food . Pork dishes Hv 'pork' taste, and one of the chicken dish Hv weird taste. Only the fried soon Hock and Some prawn dish are good. Dishes some serve in big plate and some few slices. The soup very starchy and not nice, and we mistook we can order one soup each type, actually it's only one soup per pax. As quite crowded, our order were served slow. Almost one at a time. We just sent our second order and suddenly we heard we need to give last order and suddenly 5,6 dishes came at one time. It's like they rush to close for lunch. This quality of food, half price i find exp too. Though promo 29.90++ now, with towel tea and peanut, it's 40 per pax nett for group of 4. Really not value for money at all. Disappointed.

Visited on a Sunday where the restaurant was packed. Service was great, dim sum was delicious (especially the congee), though it would be better if they have more a la carte selections on the menu.

Spacious restaurant. Having promotion, 50% discount on A-la Carte Buffet (min 4 persons). There are 2 sessions for this deal - 11am ~ 1pm or 1.15pm ~ 3pm.All guests tried to quickly order and finish within the time frame, so you can see the serving staff are super busy. But I must praised that the serving staff are super efficient and very polite. Well done. Food is quite good except dish such as prawn with chinese wine and herbs is quite diluted plus Stir-fried French bean with scallop and XO sauce is below standard. Prawns were fresh. Love Steamed Pa Ting Fish with Minced Garlic in Superior Soya Sauce (they only serve half of the fish), Deep-fried Soon Hock Fish and fried diced beancurd with Thai Style

We have been regular to this restaurant, food is fine, service standard was above average except a staff named Zheng Feng with horrendous service.Not only she's extremely rude when she talks to customers, served 'Broken dim sum' after she had obviously noticed it, she was reluctant to top up water for our ordered-tea! To make things worse, she impolitely Informed us all the dishes had all been served, when I told her there were a few more items not being served, i was given a nasty look by Zheng Feng and showed me a list of her own with all the items being ticked off! Amazing! I pointed the items were not brought to us, she then told me' You have to wait!!'... well, we didn't even rush for anything in the first place..Even though Peach Garden is a reputable restaurant with numerous loyal supporters, I don't find any justice in service rendered by mentioned staff Zheng Feng and I'm very certain that co.is not paying staff to upset their customers in order to chase them to competitors. Were I the owner, I would sack her.

There's an ongoing 50% discount for ala carte buffet for party size of 4 and above. We qualified but the service by apparently a female manager was lack lustre. She was insincere or not exactly keen to serve and was cutting in her remarks when we requested for some dishes to be served in small portion instead for the table of 12pax. A waiter had asked us to write down the number of pax who will take the respective dishes. We obeyed and think this is a wise arrangement. However this manager just dismissed our attempt and said the kitchen will decide, not without sarcastically stating that the kitchen will definitely not whipped out 10 fried fishes for the 10pax we put down. It's ridiculous to cite so as we were not there to eat so that we will suffer from indigestion. When the dishes came, the roast pork portion was miserable while the vegetables were served in gigantic bowls. Some dishes also took a long time to be served. Peach Garden's food quality is decent, however the way some wait staff executes this ala carte buffet promotion is horrible as one would believe the managers are out to protect the interests of the company more than anything. The dining experience pales in comparison to other ala carte buffets I've been to, quite disappointing to say the least.

Went for Dim Sum Lunch.Food is average, room for improvement on Taste.Service is slow , insufficient service staff to check on tables.This is the responsibility of the Duty Manager to go round and check on all tables and see what is lacking.Where is the Duty Manager ?

My first visit to PG, Buffet is NOT dim sum. For dim sum, it is 30% or 50% discount if you pay by Master or VISA. We chosed dim sum. The following is my overall ratings:- Food quality: 3/5- Service: 3/5- Value for $ : 2/5. In fact, I feel it is quite expensive- Will I return again: Not likelyGenerally, I did not enjoy my stay there
2
Service staffs gives priority and attention to buffet tables (we had the 50% off Dim sum offer; nevertheless, we are paying for every items ordered. We even had to ask for Chilli sauce to be topped up. By the way, each Food takes 30-45mins to arrive- prepare to wait. First round ordered food have not yet arrived, and they asking for last orders. After knowing we are still waiting for food, we told them we need to see it's enough, and if we like to order same ones from the first round. - so they just back down. After we had first round of dimsum, we wanted to order some more- but was downright rejected, saying no more left and saying it was last order. We made a trip to down for a relax gathering, instead, We left the fine dining restaurant hungry..

Great promo for wkday Mon to Thurs, ala carte buffet dinner. $48++ 1 for 1, excl tea $2.50++, wet tissue $1++. Min 4 diners.Nice fried fish. Steak patin was nice too but look ages to come and had lots of garlic which I liked but my frens dont. Prawns, beef, kurobuta pork, fried fish skin were nice too. Fried rice was so so. Pineapple fried rice rather than scallop fried rice. 1 serving sharks fin Soup was nice. Desserts wise, coconut jelly was tasteless but others were decent. Great service generally. Prompt to change plates and top up water. Do make reservations. V Worth it for a nice sit down dinner w grp of old frens from 6-9.15pm last order.
4
Food- Great. Very filling. Like the earlier diner indicated, the fried soon hock was good.service- Good, attentive without being obtrusive. guessing he is a part timer as hes rather young but still hard to find good service. I would had rated it 5 stars if not, for a hard kick.Pm for more info. lolx.Location- this is slightly difficult to get by public transport as its not walkable from a train station.Value - had a 50 % disc for each pax so it was value for money. But needed 4 pax for the disc. Approx $35 per pax after disc...

Was here on a weekday evening for the ala carte buffet dinner in March. Although it was a weekday evening and raining outside, the restaurant was already quite crowded when we arrived, around 6.30pm.The restaurant was located on the 3rd floor of Miramar Hotel, formerly the East Ocean Restaurant. But it was nicer and grander, with very posh decor and cosy ambience.We were ushered to our table by a friendly staff and after settling down, we were handed the "ordering menu" for the buffet. If I was not mistaken, the menu consisted of over 30+ dishes ranging from rice, noodles, meat, seafood, vegetables and desserts. It was quite comprehensive menu. Most of the items could be reordered except for those "order once exclusive" item. (if the menu can include a few other dim sum items, that would be perfect)Browsed through the menu and placed our orders. We also ordered Chinese Tea. Despite of the large crowd turn out, our food were served quite promptly. First, the food arrived "hot", meaning they were not cooked well in advance like what some other restaurants did; Second, the ingredients used were fresh, especially the prawns and fish dishes in particular; Third, the food were cooked well, thorough and also marinated great!We ordered many dishes throughout our 2hr meal, trying different dishes. Among those we ordered, we felt the drunkard prawns, wasabi prawns great, together with the sweet and sour pork, coffee pork ribs, deep fried and steamed fish. They were cooked well and yummy.As for dishes that were just passable, we felt they were the roast duck and char siew, they were too dry and cold (perhaps they were prepared well in advance).At the end, we also ordered the desserts, comprising of cocktail and coconut jelly, which were nice and refreshing, except that I felt it was a bit too sweet.Overall, the food was good!As for services, it was good too. Staff were friendly and smileful and our used plates and utensils were regularly cleared and replaced. All our ordered items were delivered despite of the large crowd and not missing dishes (this was a common sight for restaurants with large crowd). Impressed with the service!So with this, it was great value for money at around S$34 per pax (as they were having "4 for the price of 3" promotions, inclusive of the Chinese Tea ordered and the sides, peanuts.We have also visited its other branches like the one in Thomson Plaza, the main outlet at OCBC Center, this is far best in terms of food quality and service!Will revisit again

Had a very nice meal. Peking duck is very nice. Cozy and comfortable atmosphere. The rate is high but is worth the standard
2
Promotion stated more than 35 items for selection but in actual fact only 17 items.
Food wise ok, nothing to wow about. Serving time took quite long.

Yummy Dim Yum with 50% discount during lunch hours. The service was great and all the staff was attentive and friendly . It is really worth trying .

We made reservations a couple of days ahead, and we were seated together comfortably at a large table for our group of 14 when we arrived on a Saturday evening for dinner. We had the a-la carte buffet dinner for 12 adults and 2 children.We ordered various soups (one portion per person only), appetisers and main courses, and we would recommend the deep fried soon hock, drunken prawns, steamed chicken, smoked duck, fried jasmine rice, fried pepper beef, stewed beef and tendons, barbecue pork, spinach with 3 types of eggs are well recommended, but not the fried noodles (green). The choice for desserts is limited and portions small.When we were there, the restaurant was almost full, but they managed to cope quite well with the orders, and service was fairly good. Food quality was generally good

Thus is one of the outlet of Peach Garden Chinese Restaurants. It is on level 3 of Hotel Miramar. Once out from the lift, you will be welcome by the Chinese traditional deco. The staff will confirm your reservation and guide you in to the table.They will hand you the menu and follow up with the drink you like to order. The menu of dim sum is about 30 dishes. We selected 6 of them, and crispy duck and crispy pork from the alacarte menu.The serving was quite fast once started. Overall the food is not bad

Visited Peach Garden Miramar for the first time. My colleagues came upon this promo for their ala carte buffet lunch & dinner at 50% at min of 4 pax. When we reached, suprisely we were the first customers. overwhelmed by the spoilt for choices in the menu. We almost ordered everything on the list. Me and my colleagues were kind of disappointed by how blend the chrysanthemum tea was. But the food was really good.Must order: Soon hock fish (served one whole fish, cripsy fish with tasty black sauce)Drunkard prawn (prawns are live fresh prawns), si ji dou with scallops, of cos their 1 serving soup offered.I certainly enjoyed my dinner and the staff were very attentive. Very good service, Each pax was around $33.50 (after the discount) inclusive of the peanuts and pot of tea served. Definitely revisit as the promo ends end of april

Made a dinner reservation at the Chinatown Point branch for 5.45pm. Ordered the set menu and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. Usually at restaurants, there will be some dishes that are good and others that are so-so. However, we were overjoyed that all the dishes were unique and tasty. Quality was of a high standard. Delicious!!

There is no doubt that service and food at Peach garden in Miramar is excellent. No qualms about that. But I do agree with one reviewer that tea was expensive. We reserved two tables last sunday in the private section as there was a wedding in the main hall.The dim sum was fair for the price tag with the discount but not in comparison with other restaurants around town, equally good if not better and less costly.The food ordered according to the menu and the quality was good though the price was on the high side. Prawns are expensive usually and one plate with prawns served two styles came up to 96. They were outstanding (not on the menu but recommended by the manager). Prawns were done two ways with wasabi mayonnaise and coated with almonds. They were very fresh and deliciously presented, worth experiencing, worth the price tag. But tea was very expensive at 48 dollars and here were only two pots of tea one per table refilled.There were five children under the age of six in our party of ten adults occupying two tables so I dont know how they charged tea when the kids were not drinking tea.The guys had 6 beers in total which were costly but you would expect that bar price at a hotel.In the end our two table had mainly dim sum at 30 per cent discount with the star being XO carrot cake which came up to a total of 72 dollars for three small helpings. Seafood fried rice at 48 per plate was not that delicious and I would give that a skip as I ve had better at other restaurants.The star of the show not on the menu was the prawns. Other dishes ordered by were not worth mentioning. I gather from the manager we should leave it to her to recommend specials which are not in the menu which is fine as she did not let us down with the prawn suggestion.The whole bill for a few inconsequential dishes like fried rice and spinach soup with eggs plus our dim sum came up to a total of 940. Of course this was considered expensive to me as Im used to paying for good dim sum and dishes at Crystal Jade and Imperial Treasure which cost much less. Crystal Jade I might add just received a Michelin star. I think the add ons were beverages.I would go back to Peach Garden for special dishes not dim sum but I will order very carefully for specific dishes recommended by the manager. The tea I think is not negotiable as most chinese restaurants charge tea as a cover charge and Chinese understand that.However before reserving tables which include children I will request that restaurant should not charge cover for the children and certainly not serve tea but offer an alternative like soy bean or juice

We select 1 premium soup (such as shark's fin soup) out of 6 choices.As they were running on a full house with a busy wedding lunch next door, the quality of food was still passable at best.Despite being hectic, service was adequately efficient and decent. Their servers changed our plates regularly.They have a good selection of appetizers such as fish skin, salad smoked duck and roasted pork. Meat dishes such as sliced beef, sparerib with coffee sauce and kurobuta pork cube are also offered, and tender and tasty.Their seafood dishes such as deep fried soon hock fish, wasabi cream and pomelo sauce deep fried prawns as well as steamed live prawns are fresh and delectable.Vegetables like the braised baby cabbage were fresh.The portions were huge for our table of 4 adults. A mimimum of 4 persons are required.Dessets such as mango sago with pomelo, and chilled jelly with coconut are nice and refreshing.Recommended and worth considering as they were offering 50% off their weekend price of $68++, even on a public holiday.HelenSingapor

Family lunch for parents, tried the buffet promotion where 50% off for more than 4 diners. Food and service was okay in the old fashioned design restaurant...

Wow authentic in every sense of the word and real Chinese food incredibly presented and superbly prepared. Great value for money but definitely fine dining.

Food is okay but could be better. I enjoyed the Chinese dining experience though (use of special dishes etc.). Enjoyed the avocado and ice cream.

Family gathering of 16. Current promotion offers 50% off buffet prices for party of 4 and more. Food was decent without being spectacular. Roast pork was so good my Nephew had a platter to himself. The patin fish with garlic was good too and did not have a muddy smell. Service was generally prompt and attentive despite the restaurant being busy. The dessert I liked most was the jelly with coconut. The jelly seems to have been made with coconut water (or juice as come call it). The one thing I wasn't so pleased with was being charged for Chinese tea all round. Wre were asked for our drink order and some chose soft drinks, others water and some Chinese tea. I wasn't alert and didn't realise that they served everyone with Chinese tea and billed us $35 for it. I felt that was unfair to us because those that ordered soft drinks and water did not want to drink the tea.

Dinner was held during the weekday and the restaurant was pretty busy. Excellent services even though they are short-handed. There were 15 of us and they managed to fit us in one table.We ordered a few rounds dishes and strongly recommend - deep fried soon hock and steam "pa ding" fish since they were fresh and tasty. However, I am not impressed with their soup... Anyway, I would still come back again to try their suckling roast pig if they still offer this promotion. We get good value and quality buffet for 50% off their regular price during weekday

This restaurant is on the third floor of the Hotel Miramar. We had Szechuan hot and sour soup followed by udon noodles with shredded mushrooms and broccoli and mock scallops with asparagus. It was delicious and reasonable priced. There was a page of vegetarian meals to choose from. The staff were very attentive and helpful.

The decor in this restaurant was somewhat tired but the food was generally tasty. The deep fried bean skin roll with seaweed, seafood dumpling soup and steamed fish with orange peel were good. My favourites were the Roasted London duck and the chilled jelly royale in young coconut. Also the black glutinous rice in a young coconut. Service is efficient and business like.

We were looking for something close and easy on our first night in Singapore. We stumbled on this place just down the street from our hotel (Inside the Hotel Miramar). While I thought we were a little under-dressed (cargo shorts and a polo), the waitstaff assured me we were adequately clothed. With Lazy Susans in the middle of the larger tables, this place is a ‚Äúfamily-style‚Äù restaurant, where you order several dishes and everyone serves themselves from the center. A look at the menu let‚Äôs you know this isn‚Äôt familiar western-style Chinese cuisine (forget Kung Pow or General Tso‚Äôs). This is what the locals eat and some of it may look a little weird. Try the crispy fish skin (battered, fried, salmon skin‚Ä¶..tastes kinda like chicharron). We also had a Siamese beef dish, bacon-wrapped foie gras, and the main course was Hor Fun noodles with prawns and scallops in an egg sauce (really good!). All of the food was delicious and well presented. The waitstaff was friendly and helpful. While not busy when we first got there the place filled up while we were dining. Note that alcohol, in general, is pretty pricey in Singapore, so expect your dinner bill to be a little higher than usual if you‚Äôre like us and prefer a drink with dinner. Recommended

Went for the set dinner which was 6 courses plus dessert. I had the same set in August and that tasted much better. This time the noodles were rather bland and the pork quite tasteless even though it is supposed to be Kurobuta. While the price is reasonable, was disappointed with the chef cooking.
