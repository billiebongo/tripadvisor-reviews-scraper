Came here with a MASSIVE group on a Saturday night. Last minute reservations. The team were brilliant!
Fast service and good food. Simple home style, Tratorria style food and DECENTLY priced wine!!
Come and try the Canneloni! Woah!
5
Great food and great wine although it was a little empty for a Saturday evening! Would definitely recommend and come back again.
5
Good food , good ambience and good prompt service. May be need a bit more of variety in vegetarian menu.
4
Food and service was great, fresh ingredients and flavor, great italian wine too.. only issue we were the only people in the restaurant on a Saturday night at 7:30pm
4
Had dinner with friends at this pizza restaurant. Turn out the pizzas there were quite good especially like the vegetarian pizza and the mushroom pizza. Both taste really good! Surprise to see the restaurant was not busy on a Sat evening.
Best regards
Tony

Friendly servers, and due to the floor being busy, even the cook staff came out to help.
Pasta dishes are nice and good weekly offers. Prices are very reasonable for the food. This was our second time here and we plan to return.
3
ordered garlic bread and pizza. piiza buffala had too much of cheese. very okay place. value for money. not so much of fine dining.
3
friendly staffs. food was ok, service was good. we ordered pizza and pasta, pork chop, steak and tiramisu. the steak was awesome. pork chop was too hard.
2
Service: Poor. The restaurant only had two other tables but we had to ask for water and bread. Common restaurant courtesy, no? Food: Average with one shocking dish. Spaghetti vongole, pizzas were fine. What wasn't fine though, was the penne with salmon in vodka sauce. The vodka wasn't cooked off properly and still reeked of alcohol. The fish wasn't fresh and the stank permeated through the already bitter sauce. Frankly, disastrous. Now I know why this place was empty on a weekend evening. Save your money and go to the dozens of half decent Italian restaurants out there

booked a table for my wife's birthday at Capricci for a party of 2 adults and 2 children. We were given a nice secluded table at the corner. Service was prompt and excellent, very friendly staff. The menu had suitable items for vegetarian like me. Our food was served hot and quickly (probably because the restaurant was not full at that time). After our course, we were even treated to a nice glass of lemon liquor, our children ice cream, and a slice of tiramisu as the birthday cake, all compliments of this cool restaurant. it was our first visit and certainly not our last
4
Loved the house bread and pizza! Warm melted cheese just the way i like it. Vongole was good too. Lovely meal.
5
Excellent simple and true italian restaurant right in the center of Singapore. Pizza are to die for and service is really good. Very decent prices, great choices of wine from all over italy including Sardinia and Sicily.
3
This is a small, nice and friendly Italian restaurant. Like the ambience.
Food is ok and so is service.
Prices are affordable.
4
we ordered any foods and everything are good.
salad, pasta ,pizza ,sweets
I went there on weekday so not so many customs and not noisy
staff service was good.
I recommend go to on weekday
5
We enjoyed a delicious dinner at the Capricci Restaurant.
Pizzas and pastas (al dente) were perfect. The linguine nero are great.
Try as well the tiramisuüëç
All the staff is friendly and has a big smile. On top, the location is nice.
5
As always the service has been very good. The burrata and buffalo mozzarella were very good and so the pizzas.
4
Not crowded on a Saturday night, and attentive staff. Food was good, my husband said it was the best pasta bolognese he had ever had.
4
Me and my partner ate pasta as we were craving for something were rice or noodles was not included. We had carbonara and puttanesca and they both were delicious. My only wish is that my puttanesca could have had some more capris. The staff were very friendly and helpfu

Sometimes you are just in the mood for Italian food and nothing else will do. When we are here in Singapore we are always on the lookout for a place that will scratch that itch (preferably without breaking the bank). We like modern Italian but not fusion or new inventions (eg no seafood pizza, thanks). So far there are only perhaps two places to which we would return; unfortunately Capricci is not one of them. The food only just misses the mark, but it does miss. The pizza crust is not quite crisp enough and the toppings too heavy and also not flavorful enough, the risotto not quite creamy enough, and the pesto, while tasty, did not have a distinctive taste -- no taste of pine nuts, not enough garlic, not basil-y. We love pesto and make it often at home, so our bar is pretty high. One hit was the bread (pizza crust?), right out of the oven, which came with the appetizers.
4
The service was good. Food was so-so. Among others, we had the seafood platter for two. The BBQ prawn, salmon, squid were good but the swordfish was not too fresh. The chef replaced it with salmon with our request. He was happy to do so; for all he cared was we enjoyed our meals.
5
Conveniently situated at Tanjong Pagar, Capricci is a place if you looking for traditional Italian fare. Recommeded :)
2
Bread was stale and cold.
Pastas were average at best
And the other mains were not memorable in the least.
The worst part was the service. It took us over 50 mins to be served and the server was neither apologetic or gracious.
5
We were traveling through Singapore and craved for some authentic italian food. Didn't expect much, but we were pleasantly surprised. The athmosphere was very relaxing, but the food was delicious.
5
We took our very tired, hungry children here after a long day of sightseeing and were greeted warmly, fed very well...all at a reasonable price! The pizza, pasta and bruschetta were delicious. The kids loved the pizza and, of course, their gelato!Thank you to all the staff...amazing
4
Truly surprised by the past reviews, as we had a wonderful experience at Capricci last weekend celebrating our friends' birthdays. We ordered the calamari to start which is not too bad. the clams soup was average and the seafood soup more special with a little hill of prawns squids scallops and more. the squid ink pasta tasted not too bad though we've had better but the pasta could have been more aldente. Finally! The star of the night, THE PIZZAS. we ordered the bufala which was simple tomato mozarella w fresh buffalo moz on rockets BUT IT TASTED SO AMAZING. the pizza had a nice crust but wasnt overly thick, when you lift a slice up it droops so its soft and melty and chewy and crispy at the same time. Insane goodness. Maybe it's our preference but we have some hardcore pizza fans amongst us and they were feeling blissful. The staff was polite and attentive throughout, and even when we wanted to all go out for some fresh air they were considerate and trusting (since we could jolly well run off) and we were impressed. We sat outside and continued chilling well after the place was empty but no one chased us out and they not only told us to take our time, all our coffees were on the house! All in all a good experience not easily found in the fast paced Singapore eateries, the pizzas are a must have and the service truly impeccable. Highly recommend this little hideout!
5
Very hospitable. We decided on the buffet as we had never come before. We were not disappointed, the pizza was delicious as was the pasta. Will be coming here again, may work my way through the menu . This restaurant would be great for dinners also.
5
Went for a business dinner in a party of 6 so covered the menu pretty well. No complaints at all. Everyone commented on how amazing their dishes were. Most of the group shared a couple of mains because there were too many options that sounded so good.The pasta with the minced meats was great as was the pork, meat platter and pizzas. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu.Their pana cotta and chocolate lava cake was just what was needed to finish off the dinner.Staff were eager to assist with out being overbearing. There when needed but kept their distance when not. A great place for dinner of any occasion.
4
Traditional Italian dishes, well presented. I had frito misto to start, followed by osso bucco, which was excellent. The restaurant is comfortable, with bare brick walls and a few outside tables, and an eclectic mix of rock and pop music softly in the background. Service was very friendly.
5
Excellent food! And by excellent I meant it for having lived in Italy for 4 years! And what's even better very well priced and great value for money. Staff is very friendly and you'll be very well taken care of. I enjoyed dining at this restaurant many times whether with friends or in couple and it's always a pleasure to visit it.The freshly baked focaccia with some olive oil will set the stage for a great meal! ;) Don't hesitate to ask for it.
5
Held our team dinner / night out at Capricci. Fabulous restaurant and the set menu that Nazario and Daniel served was very good. If you wish to have a team outing with a nice meal then I'd certainly recommend Capricci. Excellent food, excellent service and great restaurant
3
For a high-end restaurant, you would think they could give plain Marinara sauce to dip your bread in when you tell them you are vegetarian and cant have the anchovy-based sauce that comes with it! The food was okay - nothing incredible.
5
Just great. Awesome food, beautiful place where old houses are overlooked by beautiful buildings. Nice bar outside, excellent decoration. What else?
5
Just ate at Capricci's. Excellent authentic Italian food, cooked and served by Italians! We are going back tomorrow!
5
We had a great evening out, celebrating husband's birthday with friends. The food was very tasty; authentic Italian cuisine and ambiente. Staff/host were very attentive, we enjoyed our visit very much.
5
Amazing dinner and atmosphere! If you have not been here you should.. Was great appetizer and amazing pizza! full stars for Capricci
4
good value food. nice decor. Restaurant was not crowded but relaxed atmosphere. convenient location.
3
Went for dinner and celebration for birthday..
Pizza is really good..
Service can be better..
Atmosphere is cosy
5
We've been there a couple of times. The food was very good and moderately priced. Great value for money.
5
After a few days of wonderful Singapore cuisine we needed a change and this was excellent. I had bruschetta and steak and my husband had mushrooms with mozzarella and Parma ham. Great flavours and very fresh produce. Wine selection very good too. Lovely place to eat. Highly recommend it
5
This was our first visit to Capricci. We picked it to celebrate my wife's birthday based on TripAdvisor recommendations and were definitely not disappointed! The menu offered many good options, the food was delicious, the service attentive without being intrusive, and the ambiance very pleasant. And all this at reasonable prices (by SG standards). Will definitely return
5
Great pastas! Great atmosphere and ambience, great service, waitress is attentive. Went on a Monday and it is very peaceful.
4
The food was really good and service was good too. There are a lot of Italian restaurants along that stretch and I would consider this is one of the good ones.
5
Had a good experience with this nice Italian restaurant. Osso Bucco with his rizotto was tasty as it should be. I will come back try the Gombo & Scallops Fettucini later this week üòã. A must.
4
Very good Italian food, I especially recommend the tiramisu! Plus the staff is nice and the place looks great!
5
My partner and I visited here for our first night in Singapore as we didn't have the energy to venture far from our hotel and it was very close. The food was lovely with my partner saying the Carbonara rivalled those he has had in Italy and other places in Europe. The desert of the day was a chocolate lava cake and was just delicious. The service was attentive and friendly with our meals and drinks being served quickly. Overall it was a great dining experience which I'm very tempted to repeat during our stay in Singapore.
4
This place was easy and delightful. The people were friendly and eager to let me taste and pick a wine I enjoyed. The food was wonderful. I had the lamb shank and the meat fell off the bone. If you get dessert order one of the homemade ones. Just ask.
3
conveniently located, Arrived, staff were very friendly and accommodating, seated inside (outside option available), menu fine, good selection of spirits and wines. Food was average, there was an offer of 15% discount on offer which i tried to take advantage of on production of hsbc c.c. and advised the waiter however this discount never materialized ... which was a shame.. it may not stop me going bac
5
We were having a hankering for some good Italian food & decided to visit Capricci. It did not disappoint. Starting from the Focaccia to the Eggplant Parmegiana to the different varieties of Pasta we ate.....everything was just delicious. The sorbet at the end was also lovely. Very good value for what you pay. Recommended
2
Apparently, the Chope 1-for-1 promotion (Oct 2016) means "only one item per table/bill is free", in Capricci's English. Nowhere does it state in the Chope app that this promotion can only be used once per table. Contrast this with other Chope promotions that clearly have clauses like "Limited to 1 redemption per guest and a maximum of 4 redemptions per reservation" ... I guess someone screwed up somewhere. Food was average. We were digging around so fervently to try to find the supposed ingredients (e.g. bacon, salmon) in our pasta. & the squid ink tastes strange. I can't even be bothered to edit my photos to make the colours look better.Probably won't return

Was here for a girls' night out celebrating a friend's birthday. We were the first guests on a Thursday evening, and the friendly staff and boss Daniel gave us their full attention the whole evening even as other guests came along. Service was attentive, friendly, and unintrusive -- qualities I rarely experience in SG. We had made a reservation via Chope, which offered 1 for 1 pizza and pastas, as well as 20% off bottles of wine. We had the Frutti Misty and grilled veg for starters; mains were a Papadelle (which was nicely al dente) with ragu, a spaghetti vongole (very good! almost wishing there was more sauce so we could drink it with a straw), a radicchio risotto (different to the usual casual restaurant seafood squid ink or mushroom risotto), and a prosciutto and fungi pizza which came piping hot from the oven we could see from our table. Ended with a cheese plate with a decent if not so adventurous selection of parmasan, pecorino, tallegio, and two other cheeses (can't quite remember what). And because dinner was a celebration of a friend's birthday, owner Daniel treated the lady of honour to a delicious slice of very good tiramisu, and chocolate cake which was made all the more interesting with hints of cinnamon and other warm spices. We enjoyed it lots, especially with the celebratory shots of limoncello. Yums. I only realised when we asked for the check that I had made reservations for the day before. Boss Daniel and staff were really nice about it though, and still gave us the 1 for 1 offer and the 20% off the 2 bottles of wine we had. We had a really nice time because of the service and even without the offers, the menu is very reasonably price. Thank you for a lovely evening. We will be back.
5
Nice food, price reasonable for the quality of food and the portion. Daniel was friendly and mingle with us.
4
attentive personable staff . nice wine collection . my friend n I enjoyed dining there a lot n will go back
5
Had a great time with some friends; the food was great, the wine was good and the place is not too congested.
4
Went for the pizza and enjoyed a great variety. Good wine, delicious tiramisu. Wait staff was extremely welcoming. Enjoy!
4
Dined here on a Friday evening, we were a table of 7 people. Really friendly staff & the food was excellent. I opted for beef carpaccio followed by aubergine & Parmesan & tomato bake - delicious! We drank Gavi Gavi wine which was a great accompaniment to our meal. Everyone enjoyed their dishes. As we were finishing our meal the restaurant became much more busy, quite a buzzy place.Great value, delicious food & friendly attentive service. 10 out of 10, happy to recommend this eatery

I was at the restaurant celebrating my girlfriends birthday a few days back. The local staff there offered really good service. The bald dark skinned gentlemen actually helped me a lot with my selection with wine, he explained to me where they came from and how aged the bottle was. i was amazed with the excellent service that was given to me the first 20 minutes and i felt really welcomed. When the pizza came, i was really disappointed because we waited quite bit for our food which came out to be brick hard.i had difficulties finishing such an unappetising dish and was disappointed with the quality of the pizza which wasn't up to par and wasn't like how the reviews here said it was. i complained to the dark skinned guy and he actually compensated for the bad quality of food with two free shots of limoncello and seemed to be really sorry. that aside, i was terribly disappointed because before i left i saw the italian pizza chef looking quite angry with me as if a customers opinion was an insult to him. throughout my stay he looked grumpy and angry all the time and wasn't inviting at all. don't come here ! i mean its good for drinks but if you want something better, there are plenty of shops that offer better food qualit
4
We liked the vongole soup and pasta - the clams were fresh and fleshy. Pasta was al dente too. The squid ink pasta was good but would have liked it better if they were more al dente? The mixed grill promo for two was awesome - the beef was medium rare and so was our lamb chops as requested. The pork wasn't over done and chicken were good. All in all, we enjoyed our dinner. Plus it was our friend's birthday and she had a complimentary tiramisu which was what she has been craving for weeks. We were also given extra pieces of chocolate cakes, which was a nice gesture but we much prefer the tiramisu better :
5
The food are fantastic. I loved it. The drink is also nice. I'm not sure about the price as it was treated by my boss. hehe.. I just need to enjoy it.Well, the interior is also very cozy and it is quite noisy as it was Friday night where everyone hanged out and drink beer.. oh yeahh.. Nice
5
We had a seafood pizza, salad and spaghetti, all of which were very delicious, especially pizza with the fresh cuttlefish and full taste of sea. . In general, we often had a bad Italian cuisine when we travelled outside of Europe, but we were impressed and satisfied with Italian dishes at here. The service was nice, staff were welcome and polite. Price were acceptable. A great place for whom want a meal of Italian standard
5
Combination of excellent food and 5 star service equals a winning recipie.Really great experience and highly recommended.Staff, from manager, chef, and servers go out of their way to ensure you have a wonderful dinning experience, plus the free dessert and drink was a lovely touch.Keep up what you are doing as it certainly works and thanks for a great night out
3
I've been going to Capricci for years. Sadly, the team who made it one of Singapore's best Mossimo and Conchita have left the biz and gone back to Italy. My recent visit was a shock as the food and service were only average.
5
Pizza and pasta are excellent ... you feel like Italy !!
Mozzarella di buffala is excellent too !
Our kids even made their own pizza themselves with the chief !
Prices are correct (for Singapore), we teally recommend,
Kids friendly.
5
Very good dinner: antipasto ducale, pizza parma e rucola, tiramisu'... all excellent!
My friend had also a very good pasta alle vongole.
Very nice location, and very welcoming service.
4
I've been to capricci several times and they've never failed to put a smile on my face.
Good wine and pasta!! Nice ambience and great service too.
My fav has got to be the vongole!!! üëçüèº
5
Very good atmosphere. Low price. Good food. The best Italian restaurant in Singapore I have never been.
4
The food was lovejy- in particular the burrata was delicious, as was the tiramisu. The staff were lovejy and constantly referred to me by name which I thought was a nice personal touch . Overall a lovely visit and a place to recommend!
4
This is definitely the place you should visit to eat a Italian-authentic pizza. Wines are good too. Staff is smiling and courteous.
4
One of the best pizza in singapore (I'm italian) normal price in singapore. Small choice of the menu.
4
Very good Italian food, we had the cold cut platter, Burrata salad for starter, both very good. Then we had the seafood fettucine and Gnocchi spaghetti for main course, ingredients are fresh and very well cooked.Not to mentioned their service are very good and attentive, i will def come back again on my next visit to Singapore
4
Just celebrated my husbands birthday here last night with a group of friends and it was a lovely evening. We have been coming here for 3 years since we moved to Singapore and the biggest draw is the friendly and attentive service (so hard to find in Singapore) and the good food. They have recently added more items to their menu which is a good thing, as the previous menu was a little limited and actually prevented us coming more often. If you are looking for classic good old pizza and pasta, with a decent wine selection and a friendly atmosphere, i would definitely recommen
5
The food was very delicious. We are Muslims so we couldn't eat there meat because it's not certified as halal food but in general the pizza was delicious and the pasta was amazing and good friendly too.
5
Small place with some amazing Italian food. The staff is so welcoming and nice that you feel right at home. Do ask for the house special which isn't always on the menu.
Highly recommend this place with friends and family. You won't be disappointed.
5
Excellent evening dining here. Staff, food and drink were great. Pizza was as good as any in Italy.thanks for the lemoncello it finished off a delicious meal.
5
Authentic traditional Italian cuisine! The food and wine were very nice, staff were attentive and food came out promptly. Nothing to complain about this place, absolutely amazing will definitely come back.
4
My partner and I had pasta dishes, spaghetti vongole and pesto fettucine, both of which were executed very well, especially the clams which were fresh and tasted of the sea. We also shared a tiramisu, which was creamy yet light on the palate. We were satisfied with the service, and impressed to note that the wait staff addressed us by name. Water was provided in a generous amount, which is much appreciated especially in today's context where restaurants either charge for water or serve it in very small cups. If you are using the Entertainer app, note that the 1-for-1 offer is only valid on their regular pasta and pizza dishes (and not all mains as the app suggests).
3
An enjoyable evening with reasonably priced wine (for Singapore) and friendly, cheerful service. However, the food is very, very average. Nothing came out of the kitchen I wouldn't feel comfortable making myself at home, and I am by no means a chef.I started with the "salmon carpaccio." Rather than the anticipated thinly-sliced raw salmon dressed in whatever style the chef chose, the dish was just a few slices from a packet of a supermarket-purchased smoked salmon with a few leaves thrown on it. That really is not acceptable from any restaurant
3
I chose the place based on the reviews of good pizza. The experience was not so rejuvenating. We guess that the pizza was made of dried mozzarella and too much oily. Unlikely to be choice of a pure Italian. I with my girlfriend ordered a siciliana and a capricciosa pizza. The lemon sorbetto to was good. The service was okay as we did not have to wait for the pizza. The prices are high as expected since the location is in the heart of Singapore. In a gist the overall rating by us is average
4
Living in Asia, you sometimes crave comfort food that isn't easy to find like brick-oven pizza. There have a number of pizzas options. I had the arugula with parma ham/prosciutto, cherry tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and tomato sauce. This met my craving and, at a time, when I needed the comfort aspect too. It's a bistro atmosphere which I enjoyed and the service was excellent. I'd definitely return
5
I went there for dinner with a group of 8 friends. The service was very good, and very efficient. The atmosphere was very good as well. Background music at the perfect level. But the best part was the pizza. I have lived in Italy and the pizza here is just exactly how the serve it in Italy. My friends had pizza and pasta, and there were amazed with the quality of the food. And prices are really really good too. I am definitely coming bac
5
I really enjoyed the food - the penne amatriciana and buffalo mozzarella were lovely. And service by Mr Mohd Ali was excellent! He never rushed us to make the order even though we really took our time, and even offered to call me a cab when I said I was going to get one
4
Staff is very good and friendly. The place is right in the heart of the city at Tanjong Pagar serving good food. Worth dining there
4
Friendly service with lovely staff. Good hearty food nothing fancy but good value. Casual and relaxed atmosphere.
5
Usually food of all kinds in sg is twisted to too sweet or too spicy to suit the local tastes, but not in Cappricci. Thats why i like the way it keeps what italian food is supposed to be like. Thumb up.
4
Warm and welcoming start, great food, excellent service and perfect for a celebration dinner. I highly recommend the beef carpaccio starter. The house Chianti is a perfect accompaniment to the yummy fettuccine pesto!
5
Great atmosphere, rustic italian cosiness. Pizza is great, so is the tiramisu. But for me, it's the warmth and welcoming nature of the employees that really makes this place shine. Would definitely come back.
5
I was taken to this restaurant for a business dinner...the food was good though the service standards do need a bit of improvement. Cosy place to relax, have a drink and discuss business followed by good Italian Food. My thumbs up!
5
Is not easy for an Italian to go to eat and enjoy the food at an Italian restaurant abroad but for this restaurant I can say that was really an exception......really gret italian food. Bravi
5
We visited on a Wednesday at about 8pm. We were greeted and seated quickly. We had a pasta dish and a pizza between us, and a garlic bread to start, and 1 soft drink which came to about $63 after tax and service. The food came up quickly and was really tasty! I thoroughly enjoyed my bolognese and my boyfriend said his pizza was lovely, and a decent size. We would recommend this place, not far from Chinatown station
5
So, the local food is great and everywhere in Singapore. Try it. Love it. Experience the people of the city in a unique and charming way that happens only around the food. THEN when you're ready for Italian, head straight for Capricci. Great pizza from their own brick oven right in the restaurant. Pasta, roasted veggies, nice wine, all great!Now the above and beyond part. I was chatting with the manager about my terrific stay--you know how I liked my hotel, the various favorite spots, the sweetness of the people. Anyway a little too much wine, and I left without my credit card. I got a call when I returned to my hotel. The manager had brought my card to the front desk to be sure it was returned to me personally. Enough said! Go there and enjoy!
2
The food was not bad. However, service was poor. We asked the waiter nicely twice (repeating several times on the second try) to help us take a table photograph but was refused. The first time, he said his hand was oily but we said we didn't mind but he ignored us and never came back. The second time, after asking a few times (really, he couldn't hear?), he said they were busy and understaffed (I looked around, I think he could afford a few seconds, and he didn't ask his colleagues who didn't seem too busy to help as well). I won't be going back again. There are good italian restaurants with better value and service
4
Good dinner. Loved the food and wine. Service was patchy at first but changed after we prompted them on it. Salmon was great and so was the pasta with carbonara.
5
Professional service. Very nice atmosphere, cosy. Good for couples or friends. Food is amazing. And of course good wine.
3
The title says it all: great pizza, average burrata, bad tiramisu.
Good booking system and flexible manager. Location is good but deco is average.
4
Good food and wine but service could be a little better. Decent ambience and sitting arrangement but a little overpriced compared to other restaurants in the similar price range.
4
What surprises me is that it has a small lovely bar outside. Service is okay, not bad because we liked one waiter, and half of the time of the second waiter. The other half of the time of second waiter, and the third waiter, is just okay. Lack of a bit consistency in service level but we only want the food :)The food. Tuna tartare is very average since the tuna is not very fresh. The prawn salad is okay for me, since it's just putting prawn and veggies together with some nuts cracks. My girlfriend liked it though. The lobster spaghetti is wonderful. The spaghetti is just nice, not one second less or more boiled, with a little cute toughness inside. The mushroom risotto is also very tasty, but portion is big and flavour is a bit heavy (a lot of cheese!) so better go with no previous food in your stomach. Overall consider price and service and environment, Etna is more favourable to me but Capricci is also a good choice.
2
Been to this restaurant for a few years but tonight was a disaster .... Salmon carpaccio was just a tossed salad with a few thin slices of over salted salmon ... At 22 sgd, felt totally ripped off. Pasta was ok. But service took forever. Only 2 servers for the whole place. Could never get desserts ... This can not be the 10 best Resto in Singapore!!
3
Went here on an eatigo 50% discount. Food was good for what we paid for. Pastas were hand made and delicious. However, the lamb chops were rather measly. Pumpkin puree was more of a sauce than a puree. Would stick with the pasta if I visit again
5
Excellent buffet lunch selection for an affordable price of $15++. Excellent ambience and plays really good background music.Staff knows who you are when you walk in and they are extremely friendly.Good for taking business partners, family and friends for a good time of fellowship and makan!Die die must try
3
Good. Not way more, unfortunately. Maybe a matter of luck as we came pretty late and the place was nearly empty. Pizza was excellent. Risotto was very good and pasta with zucchini was ok, with very strong taste of saffron, too strong for me. Apple strudel desert was excellent.
3
We visited this restaurant as it was close to our hotel and had good reviews but sadly it failed to live up to expectations.It was fairly quiet when we arrived and we had expected it to be busier, but this meant service was quick enough. I had risotto with prawns and asparagus, but there were only three prawns and no trace of any asparagus. The risotto was tasty enough but had probably been cooked in fish sauce so that would explain the taste.My wife ordered the truffle infused risotto with mushrooms but there were no mushrooms in sight and her risotto was decidedly bland and tasteless. We also ordered focaccia bread as a side so we could use up the olive oil and balsamic which had been given with bread to start, but we were given a thin crust garlic pizza type bread. We live in Europe and know exactly what focaccia bread looks like and this was definitely not it.When we were almost finished the owner, or senior member of staff who was doing some cooking and wearing jeans ?? went behind the bar ans turned up the volume of the music which had been fine until then. He seemed angry and was a bit off-putting, but why turn the music up so loud?Not what we had expected
5
We love Capricci. The food is consistently good and service is great. We have been going for over 2 years. Last week was just as good. Well done!
5
I've been to a lot of bars in my time but this is by far the best bar in Singapore. The staff is amazing, the food is good and on top of that its great value. Make sure you visit
5
I swear the pizzas here are sinfully good. SO GOOD I cannot express in words please come and try them yourself. The staff are fantastic, and if you come often enough they'll probably remember you by name as well ;) Love this place!
5
Hands down, friendliest staff with excellent service. Their pizzas are amazing, I would definitely recommend Capricci to anybody whose looking for a chill night out with great food around this area.
5
I have been patronising Capricci for the past few years. Each time I am here, I always feel at home. Perfect ambience, impeccable service and fantastic service. What more can I ask for?. Price is reasonable.
4
Easily booked through Chope. Staff was very friendly and allowed me in even though I was early for my reservation. Meals were affordable.
4
Cold cuts, burrata parma ham were good. Pizzas were good, but the pasta and the risotto were outstanding.
3
I've eaten here a few times before; great place & good service. Oddly enough I had never tried their pizza's, opting for pasta's and the like. This time round I did try a pizza. A buddy of mine did the same and our review is practically the same. The crust is good (perhaps bc of the 72 hours rising), but the pizza toppings are very quite bland. We opted for vegetarian pizzas as my buddy is vegetarian; yet even his 4 cheese pizza required a lot of tabasco

Everything here says Italy. Very good selection of Italian wines at a very reasonable price. The ambiance and service is much better than most places in the area and recommendations by the server were just perfect. If you are looking for casual Italian, this is the place to go
5
My favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore! I am always back for their lobster pasta and lava cake because they are the best. The staffs are always very friendly and efficient. The ambiance is romantic and it's perfect for couples but it is also great for families. Sometimes towards the end of the night, they play really good music too
4
The waiters are very friendly and helpful, the food is good, without being excellent, the pizza was good, but slightly overbaked.
It got a top ranking among Singapore restaurant, however maybe it is overrated.
Prices are higher than average for similar restaurant in Singapore.
5
Finally an Italian restaurant that serves real authentic Italian food! Tasty risotto, great pizza and delicious burrata are on the menu. Prices are very reasonable for food of this quality.
5
One of my favourite Italian restaurants for my husband and I. Nice ambience and friendly service, food is super tasty , (although a couple of dishes were a tad on the salty side but my husbands likes it that way. ) but the warm welcome and friendly service always makes for an enjoyable evening. Lobster pasta is definitely one of my favourites
5
Capricci provided my girlfriend and I with an unforgettable night. Both the service and food was top-notch and on top of that, the staffs were very friendly. One of them even took the initiative to take a picture of us with the xmas tree as the backdrop.All in all, it was a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back
2
we ordered focaccia they delivered pizza base garlic bread not a problem but not a word to say why, which i found a cheek. especially as I pointed it out.we ordered risotto it had no mushrooms and no taste.the setting was Italian it was ok,but please dont insult me by serving not what we ordered.then they had a debate whether we should get a complimentary drink which we overheard.also one of the chefs was wearing jean
5
Charming and authentic Italian restaurant in Tanjong Pagar. The ambience is great and the owner was very friendly and accommodating. Pizzas were spectacular, as good as I have had in two years living in Singapore, and the starters were excellent too. Not excessively expensive by Singapore standards either.Will definitely be coming back
5
I have been to many a Italian Restaurants, but I especially love this open floor vibe that spills out onto the street. Came here on a quiet weeknight and as soon as the complimentary bread basket rolled in, I knew I was in for a treat. Service to me has always got to compliment the food most often, and our server was top-notch and nothing short of class and professionalism. We had pizza, salad, carpaccio, and pasta. 10/10 for all! Will be back soon
5
i ate here recently with my family, my eldest son who lives in Singapore had seen it well reviewed on this site.. It's situated amidst fierce competition in Tanjong Pagar Road so it needs to be good!the owner is extremely welcoming, charming and effusive and the interior is roomy and very pleasing on the eye with plenty of space between tables which I always appreciate.The starters were as good as it gets and the pizzas terrific. All in all a most enjoyable experience
3
The food in Capricci was ok or good at it's best and the wine also but it would be exaggerating to say that the overall experience was very good. The bread was poor. Therefore just 3 points. Outside in front of the restaurant is a counter where you may have a beer while waiting for your table. But instead of Italian beer there was just Asahi, Tiger or Corona available. International beat music is not something you would like to hear and also the service experience wasn't very Italian.
5
My group of 4 girls and 1 guy ordered 3 dinner sets and 1 pizza, and it was more than sufficient!Each dinner set comes with a starter, a main course and a dessert. You get to choose from 3 starters (tuna tartare, beef tenderloin carpaccio and spinach flan) and 2 desserts (tiramisu and creme brulee). You also have a whole host of main courses to choose from (truffle risotto, beef tenderloin, pork kurobata, gnocchi, pasta, etc).As we had 3 sets, we managed to try all starters and desserts. They were all good but special mention must be given to the awesome spinach flan and creme brulee. I'm not a fan of spinach and creme brulee but they tasted so good surprisingly.For main courses, we had truffle risotto, beef tenderloin and pork kurobata. Risotto was comforting, beef was not bad while the pork cheeks were tender!The place was not noisy but comfortable; not pretentious. Although a server was overly friendly till it was not very funny, they were all nice people who served happily
3
First time at this Italian restaurant and its a nice place for dinner gatherings as its not too noisy. Food is good except that its on a pricey side. Must try the lobster pasta.
Overall a nice dining experience although service was a bit slow.
4
Best pizza we've had in Singapore. Also good service. One of the few places that will give you bread before your meal for free.
4
It's a nice little restaurant which serves GREAT and authentic italian cuisine. Really loved the two pastas which we had ordered. Great environment also. Good for a nice brunch.
5
We were late (10pm) but still got the full Card and full Attention by the staff. Great experience and definitly an address to remember. Anytime in Singapore again.
4
The waiters were very friendly, food served very fast and tasted great. Good selection of wines too :) It is a bit expensive but with the quality of food, it was satisfying.
5
For three years now, Capricci has been welcoming me with a genuine smile, fresh and delightful food, excellent selection of wine, attentive service and a real human touch.I like the casual style of this restaurant, which on a busy night creates a spontaneous party with great dancing music and friendly atmosphere.Capricci private room (wine cellar) is excellent for a romantic date.Thank you for being so wonderful
5
Dined in this restaurant with a few colleagues a week ago - 16 Oct. We stumbled in randomly after checking out other restaurants in the area and were pleasantly surprised. Our waitress, Lena was absolutely amazing. She was very warm and friendly and made us all feel right at home. The food and wine were excellent and we all had a great time. Have to say that it was probably the best meal I've had in Singapore
5
I stopped counting my visits in Capricci restaurant. After every visit I can't wait for my next travel to Singapore to eat there again.All dishes are excellent, great taste from the appetizers to the desserts.Thank you for the opportunity to eat food you are preparing
5
Wife and I are frequent users of the entertainer and saw that capricci was on their app. Went there with another couple. Wait staff were very busy when we got there but as soon as we were seated we were treated like family. Wine selection is good enough and good value. Food was very tasty and one of the chefs even popped out to serve us his special chilli oil which was remarkable! Overall a great night out!
4
I've dined here twice. The food is very tasty (albeit a little salty), generous portions, and the service is very promopt (waiting staff constantly refilled our table water, was very friendly and smiley, and food came promptly). I would recommend this place for a quiet dinner and authentic pastas
5
Food and service was exquisite
Nothing to complain about this place absolutly amazing will definitly come back.i and my friend has a pizza all good and delicous.
1
Came based on the popular ratings but found it overall a disappointing meal. Food- 2.5/5. Service - 2/5 (we were left to serve ourselves and they don't serve bread). Ambience - 2.5/5. Local restaurants have more to offer!
5
I had burrata with parma ham as appetizer and half sleeves pasta with sausage and mushroom as main course. The appetizer was clearly fresh and of high quality. The main course cooked at perfection. Vast choice of wines, bottles or glasses. Great taste and exceptional!
5
You will not one want to miss one of the finest restaurants in Singapore a city of fine food and eateries. Capricci is one of Singapore's best. Great food. Great prices. Great service. Wonderful reasonably priced wines.
5
Amazing food and coffee would always come back for lunch and dinner!! Staff is very friendly and always there to help! The restaurant is very pretty inside.
4
Went here for my dad's birthday, the food and wine were very nice, food was nicely presented and was a good quantity. Staff were attentive and food came out promptly (however it was fairly empty when we were there). Would definitely recommend to a friend/come back
5
Authentic traditional Italian cuisine, it is truly classic Italian fare for Italian expats to settle their hankering for true foods from home or for people who wish to have genuine Western dishes in Singapore. Great list of wines to pair with foods, Most of them are from various regions of Italia. The staffs are friendly and very attentive. Overall put it on your 'must try' Italian list. I never tasted such delicious Italian food, outside of Italy.
5
I had an excellent meal with my friends. It was a last minute decision to eat here, but turned out definitely worth it. The service was great, very friendly staff. The food was italian with a little edge, the pizzas were instead very traditional, overall it was amazing. Surely come back, and i highly recommend this place
5
My wife and I were to Capricci at 2:25 PM. Even if the kitchen closes at 2:30 PM they offered us to order some pizzas, so we did it. Pizzas were good, bread was one of the best in Singapore and the size is also good. Service was excellent. Even if we arrived when they were almost closed, they were always friendly and nice. I want to mention Mohammed, the person who served us (manager, maybe?) because of his extremely good service and kindness. we will go back soon for sure, at the right time, to try their buffet lunch for just $15 nett. Definitely must be a good deal
1
We had a pizza with Parma ham (which wasn't Parma ham) and porcini mushrooms, the pizza bread wasn't good, if you wait for a while u may risk to lose your teeth eating it. It was also too oily. Same for the pasta: the sauce was too much strong (a loot of cheese and butter). The staff was unprofessional and annoying
4
Probably the best pizza in Singapore! Great for the families or dinner with friends. The service is decent. Overall, Good value for money.
5
I have never tried a pizza better than Capricci's one. It's big and crispy. I love their tenderloin steak too. We'll come back for more
5
Excellent italian food , with Real italian dishes. Friendley and helpfull staff. Not to be missed!!!! Massimo, the owner, is a great and amazing person.
5
The food excellent, the service very warm and the owner very nice. the menu very sophisticated and choice of the best wine.
5
Beautiful Italian food, but with more variety/flavour than traditional Italian cuisine! Cocktails at happy hour (with complimentary arranchini) were beautiful: much better value and more delicious than those at Clarke Quay! So delighted by cocktails that we stayed for dinner- delicious fresh food at very reasonable prices. Would return and recommend.
5
The owner and chef is Italian, bringing his skills from Rome for the benefit of Singapore. The food was outstanding. My youngest daughter, who is an expert on all things Risotto, said it was the best she'd ever tasted. My vegan daughter was well looked after and there were a number of good options for her too. The staff were very knowledgable about the drinks and their service was prompt and amiable. I strongly recommend this restaurant as it's some of the best Italian Food we have eaten
5
I have been to this place on a regular base in the last three years. Never been disappointed by the quality of the food they serve here. Paccheri with sausage is my favourite pasta and diavola is my pizza. The staff looks like been working there since day one and they know all their customers by name. Very good place
4
Been on a hunt for good risotto for awhile, this place have one that I really like! It's the one with prawn and asparagus. The staff is pretty attentive and we also ordered the Parma ham with buffalo cheese, it's refreshing! Would def come back again for more risotto when I have the craving
5
I went to Capricci last night with my friend. We opened the night with cold beers to chill down at the outside seating area where the ambiance is very nice. Then we had Martinis that were neatly prepared by the bartender who was very nice and attentive--no the kind of service you expect in Singapore so this is a huge positive. Finally, the owner also talked to us and we had a great sense of outstanding hospitality. I'll recommend that place to locals and visitors--great night out
3
I and my hubby went to this place last night @July 21,2015. He made a reservation for my birthday dinner and told me this place have a very high rating. So, I expected my foods and wine will be good here with excellent service. Turned out this place is nothing like I expected. Absolutely agreed with a few comments below that How is this place got very high rating like this. Let's talking about food 1. Mushrooms soup is so average. 2. Cold cut meat and Cheeses ; cheese was OK but cold cut is super Duper salty. I left it for hubby to finish it and one kind of cold cut he just left it there no one could eat. The prosciutto in this place is super dried crispy which good one will never be like this. 3. Pizza again was very average and dough quite thick. 4. Salmon steak so flavorless not juicy and sweet as I normally had in restaurant. 5. Chianti bottle was only 2.5 of 5 starsIt was like 25 people in the restaurant with ONE waiter. So, I end up pouring wine for myself and for hubby except first glass that we been served. I don't really care about price we paid which 190.67$ for 2 of us but foods quality is so far off to called a Good meal. I'm so wondering how this place got so high rating? As specially I saw a lot of single review user here.
5
Capricci is the place to go to in Tanjong Pagar for a satisfying Italian dinner. The pizzas are mind blowing, and the wine selection good. Massimo has recruited a great team of wait staff as well.
5
One of the best pizzas I have had in Singapore. They have a great selection of wines and beers, served by the most friendly staff, which can be hard to come by in Singapore!
5
There are mixed reviews of this place but I thought the food was great and the staff are really brilliant compared with a lot of places around. The PIzza is great and they have an extensive wine collection to boot
4
A very popular choice. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is nice and cosy. Good for birthday celebrations or private dinners. The service is great as well.
4
2 fresh pastas, 3 kinds of pizzas, extensive fresh salad buffet with freshly baked bread and softdrink for SGD 15 net - hard to beat
5
I love the cosy decor and open frontage of capricci . The staff are warm and welcoming and give good friendly service . Although a casual ambience , the food is high quality and tasty. Fresh buratta appetizer with Parma hamAnd rocket was huge and good to share as well as the deliciously fresh beef carpaccio. Main course prawn and asparagus risotto had just the right amount of creaminess. Rest of the group had home made pasta with sausage sauce and gnocchi with four cheese and all felt the portions where extremely filling and full of taste.
5
With excellent food and the friendliest staff you'll find at Singapore, Capricci will make you feel at home every time. Capricci has quickly become my favorite restaurant to visit in Singapore. The both the food and wine menus have a wide range of selections, I strongly recommend the pizza. If you are looking for a great place to catch up with friends or just looking for some excellent Italian food, I recommend you give Capricci a try
5
This is definitely the best restaurant I have been to in Singapore during the last year. Me and my friends have chosen the place to celebrate our graduation. We have booked the table through the restaurant's web site. When we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly and polite waiter Muhammad. He immediately took us to our table, made sure that we are comfortable and when we were ready helped us a lot with the menu, explained about every dish we have asked him about and gave good advices regarding the wine list (which offers a wide variety of wines).the appetizers arrived within 10 minutes all together which was great, because we were able start eating together without waiting until all of us will be served. the main dishes arrived as soon as we finished the starters, again all dishes together for three of us. every time we needed something the waiter was just there to help us. Muhammad really made us to feel as we were very special guests. At some point the owner of the place congratulated us personally. Such level of service and attitude is very rear these days. the food was amazing, all ingredients are of a high quality and very fresh. We licked our fingers. Buretta Mozzarella and Gnocci are highly recommended. We spent in the restaurant almost 4 hours and didn't want to leave. Excellent service, great food and very calm and friendly atmosphere made our graduation celebration to be remembered for a long time. I would definitely come there again soon

We had out of town guests, and instead of going to somewhere we know is good in the neighborhood like Latteria or Etna, I decided to venture out to something different using Tripadvisor - and boy was it not a good idea. The setting of the restaurant feels like a casual diner but the prices were like those of an upscale restaurant. Portions of the food was very small and taste was barely mediocre - totally not worth the price. Remembered the wine was also barely okay and the waiter didn't really know much about wine. I was very disappointed that I took my guests to a poor restaurant. With so many good Italian restaurants in Singapore and even just in Tanjong Pagar area, we will most definitely not go back to Capricci, given the bad food and high prices. We don't quite understand why it is rated so high on Tripadvisor
5
The Capricci is one of the best Italian restaurants in town. Not only for the food, but also for the ambiance of the place. The staff & the Chef are very friendly and know you after a couple of visits to their place. It is very near to my office, so I go there often with my friends and colleagues

Its a nice place üëçüèª, amazing pizza and the pasta.,, i really love pasta ‚ù§Ô∏èüçù., good Italian food! üëèüèª good service! üòä

Been there for business dinner, good quality and service. Good variety of dishes and wines. Found some good tuscanian reds had drunk during my stay in Italy.
4
Nice venue in crowdy Tanjong Pagar close to Chinatown and Cbd.
Amazing pizzas and italian food. Good service specially from bartender.
Will return again asap.
3
we used to be regulars. the place really changed. portions became smaller, prices went up. service staff is invonsistent. don't know how sustainable this strategy is. if you want a fair deal at this place, go for pizza. to be fair: quality of food is in average still okay
3
Went there for dinner earlier this evening. Food was average. Our pasta was somewhat 'undercooked'. And my pasta dish with the homemade sausage was on the salty side. Service staff were friendly but service could be better. I think with so many good Italian restaurants in Singapore they will need to raise their standards a bit more.
3
We had dinner at Capricci and were not impressed with the food and services. The appetizers were generally in small portion, the linguine with sea bass in white wine was rather oily while the spaghetti with lobster was bland. The texture of the handmade spaghetti was also rough. Did not live up to the rating and a bit pricy
5
We had read reviews on TripAdvisor - and weren't disappointed from the appetiser of Burrata with Parma ham, to the pizza Diavola, to the triple perfumed risotto with homemade pork sausage and porcini mushrooms and later the creme br√ªl√©e -- all was delicious with an attentive Italian owner. A very excellent evening -- we will definitely be back
5
We booked our table through Tripadvisor and it worked great!! We tried this place due to its great reviews and we were far from disappointing. The service was attentive yet the staff were relaxed and really funny. The food was incredible! We had the Vongole Pasta to share and then 2 pizzas. Absolutely Spot On!
5
Capricci offers a great lunch buffet for only 15$ during weekdays, with a drink included. There is a big choice of salads, plus pizzas (that taste amazing), a soup and a first and second course that changes every week. The food tastes very good and the restaurant looks very nice. The staff is friendly and always present, welcoming you with a great smile
5
After a lengthy bit of research cross referencing using both trip advisor and various blogs/forums for an Italian restaurant, one in which we could specially get pizza for dinner, I made a reservation at Capricci!Staff were wonderful & we were treated like royalty! In particular our waiter who had a great sense of humour and a sixth sense where filling water glasses & taking away plates were concerned!Pizza was just exquisite, the dough which they allow to rise for 72 hours could have a restaurant all by itself! It was a little bit life changing! The strudel & vanilla gelato were light and perfect after a hearty pizza!Will I be back? Workout a doubt!Thank you to the staff and chef here for a wonderful evening
5
Went here for lunch buffet. Though there was not much choices, the food was enough to fill our bellies and then some.
The menu was misleading as there was no dessert present but then again, that's what you get for $15.
1
Food bad, service bad... Took ages... A big NO. Took 90 mins to get a pizza, wrong food delivered, nice interior design but very bad managed.
5
I was there a couple of times . Everything was great , from the service to the food being served. It was a pleasant experience. Certainly . I'll be going back there again! I love the food! Indeed , it was money well-spent!
5
went on the 11th april for dinner with my wife for her birthday. the staff was very nice and the food was delicious.! would go there again when I'm down in singapore. for people who likes italian food this is a top restaurant.
4
Very pleasantly decorated restaurant on what seems to be a busy street but being a little late at night didn't feel the congestion.Pleasantly decorated with good italian food and a wide choice of Italian wines and beers.Must visit for good italian food be it Pizzas Pastas etc.
4
My entree was great but the lobster spagetti was quite tasteless. My wife though loved her steak. We got the $55 deal and the ambience out the back is great and the service is good. The desserts were very small but we didn't have much space left
2
I tried Capricci for the first time in March 2015 and do not plan on going back. The service was slow and poor, and our table was neglected. It took 30 min for our food to come out and they didn't offer us bread meanwhile (we had to ask for it). I'm not sure if was due to the restaurant week craze, but IMO that shouldn't be an excuse for poor service and mediocre food. Better Italian options in the area: Otto, Etna & INItaly
5
I had an opportunity to try their light semi buffet yesterday. With given the price,it's really worth it. Food quality is also good. Will I go back? Yes. I don't think it's a place for a romantic dinner, more of a smart casual italian dinner with colleagues or friends.. Definitely not on a special occasion 
5
We had dinner at Capricci on a Friday night: the restaurant was fairly busy but service was still friendly and attentive.This is an excellent place for Italian food. Our pizzas and homemade fettuccine were excellent. The wine list is interesting with good solutions for all the price ranges. We will go back,
5
I went there already a couple of times and every time it gets better and better. The staff is very friendly and the service was fast despite the restaurant was almost full. Unlike other restaurants, the waiters always care about feedback from costumers. I had burrata with parma ham as appetizer and half sleeves pasta with sausage and mushroom as main course. The appetizer was clearly fresh and of high quality. The main course cooked at perfection and superbly "al dente". Great taste and generous quantity. Vast choice of wines, bottles or glasses. As usual, to confirm the kindness of the staff, free shot of sambuca.The place to be in Singapore for business or casual occasions. No doubt
5
Capricci is the most italien "Italien restaurant" in Singapore. Not only the quality of the food but also quality of the service was extraordinary. Especially compared to those places who boast having visiting chefs of 3 Michelin stars, Capricci is by far a treat..
4
Thank you for very nice evening with delicious food, fast service. Restaurant has a great location, surrounded by many nice bars.
5
Enjoyed excellent lunch buffet. My daughters enjoyed the pizzas....loved the broccoli. Great value for money!!!
5
We've been at Cliffords in Fullerton Marina Bay some days before. This was for sure good food as well but twice expensive. At Capricci we had a relaxed amtosphere, a very friendly service and excellent food. Best thing you can do.
5
Great place located in downtown Singapore, along vibrant Tanjong Pagar Road. Really enjoyed meeting the chef Massimo and his wife and the pizza was simply to die for! Have been to Italy a few times, but this pizza topped the charts! Everything is handmade and the ingredients are fabulous. Will definitely go back. Also have an extensive pasta selection and some great starter plates, including a creamy mushroom soup and a tuna tartare. Great service and experience. Highly recommend
5
The place is small with a private atmosphere that make you feeling at home. We order a Burrata with ham that was very good and then a beef tenderloin also very tasty. Homemade bread and a good quality olive oil was on the table. The Wine was also good and in perfect temperature. Service fast and professional with a very nice Singaporean guy. The two Italians owners were very nice and come many time to ask about the dinner and at the end they offer us a nice digestive drink. The dinner was expensive but in average with Singapore's price.
5
I had the pleasure to eat in Capricci after the recommendation of an Italian chef friend of mine. The place is located south west of singapore, 5 minutes taxi ride from Marina Bay and Clark Quay, nearby Chinatown. What we liked the moment we first saw it, was the informal atmosphere of the place. Italian dining shouldn't be always fine dining, after all it's all about the food and the right ingredients, not about how fancy the place looks like.And Capricci certainly ain't fancy but it's decorated with taste and warmth. As we entered, we were greeted by the owner Massimo and his wife. For me, that's a big deal when the owner interacts with his guests. Too many times in Italian restaurants in Asia this Italian custom is ignored and that degrades the whole dining experience. Luckily, in Capricci they've got this right!Massimo suggested some of the dishes in his menu based on what we wanted to eat, and so we ordered a pizza with arucola and parma ham, a tagliata of agnus beef and a lovely appetizer of mozzarella burrata. Despite of the pizza being done in an electric oven, it was one of the best pizzas I've had in recent years. The ingredients used by Massimo are truly genuine and fresh, I was impressed!The meat was also perfect: we requested to have it done medium-well and it arrived as requested, but still tender and juicy. The mozzarella burrata blew my mind too, so rare to find such a quality.Overall, we had a very good dining experience that ended we a nice walk through Chinatown before heading back to our hotel, and we are looking forward to go back to Singapore to visit Capricci again
4
We really enjoyed our dinner here. Our food was very good & the pork cheeks were a particular standout. My husband had one of the specials, a handmade pasta with spicy italian sausage which he really enjoyed. Dining out in Singapore can be quite hit and miss at times, but this place is definitely a hit. Excellent wine list
5
Capricci is a bar and restaurant with a lively bar at the front and quieter tables at the rear. We enjoyed the 4 cheese Gnocchi, Fettuchini and Grilled Chicken with mixed vegetables followed by Apple Strudel and Creme Brullee (Chefs special).All were truly excellent and compared with some of the best Italian themed meals we have enjoyed, anywhere.It is always appreciated when the chef comes to your table to make sure your are enjoying the meal and Max and his staff were fine and appreciative hosts. I am only sorry that I wasn't able to test out the impressive looking wine list due to an impending long haul flight.Thoroughly recommended
4
We were at Capricci for dinner and although we had reservation, it took us a while before we could get anyone interested in getting us a table. Admittedly it was New Years eve; still a bit more interest would have been welcoming. Thankfully, we were ushered to our table before it could be deemed long enough to spoil the evening.Then on, it was an experience that just kept getting better. Great food paired with nice wine - recommendations by Mahafi who was not only knowledgeable about what he was serving but also had a great sense of humour. Inspite of a very packed restaurant, he ensured that we were well looked after, food arrived on time and our glasses were full. We will go back and again and I am sure to say hello to Mahafi again. He brightens up the place
4
Capricci's lunch buffet is my all time-favs! One of the best restaurants for Italian food in Singapore. And it's great value for money!
5
I have been there for dinner a number of times, but most recently went for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by the cheap and cheerful lunch buffet they offer.
Good pizza, great pasta and great service - also convenient location.
5
Perfect Italian restaurant with excellent food... We took the menue.... Awesome nothing to tell in addition. The price was fair and the service very good.
2
Friendly service, but so unorganized that it spoiled the whole experience. Pizza was excellent, whereas the rest was just "ok".
5
Loved the food.
The service was excellent too.
Wait staff great sense of humour and his recommendations were spot on.
Wish they had raviolli and lasagne though.
Will definitely be back :):)
4
We have wanted to try capricci for a while now and finally we got our chance. Once we arrived the bartender who appeared to be in charge of the restaurant that night greeted us and gave us a comfortable table spot. Restaurant has pretty good wine selection. Must try the Amarone. Our appetizer were very tasty, try the tuna tartare and the burrata cheese, amazing. Our pizza was too spicy we couldnt finish but the lamb was awesome and it didnt taste gamey either so it was perfect. It is a casual dining. The service chat with you and make jokes, its fun. Usually we had pizza delivery but going here was worth it. Tanjong Pagar also a nice area there are many restaurants around.
3
I was here in Jan 2015 for lunch on a weekday with colleagues. They had the $15 lunch buffet. I did not like what the food options they offered for the lunch buffet, so I opted for a la carte. I ordered the seebass pasta. Food was tasty but at almost $30, I felt it was not good value for money. Service was also slow
5
This was probably the best italian food I had in Singapore. I rarely eat raw meat especially raw beef, but the carpaccio here.....it's so tasty, love the way the chef prepare this dish. Their pizza and pasta was great too. The waiter was very helpful and recommended us which dish to try
5
I has a dinner gathering for about 30 people. From the initial contact, Massimo was very responsive and easy to work with to customise a dinner plan. It was not the first time, we had a party at Capricci in 2012 and had fond memories. That was a big reason why we chose it again. The night itself, the staff wowed. Food was great and when there was a lull in food service (prob from catering for 30 and running a full restaurant, which is no easy feat), they supplemented with more food and drinks. Making the event even more memorable were the staff, attentive, friendly without being intrusive, we felt we were amongst friends. Needless to say, we had a great time. I will not hesitate to do another event there again.
5
I held an event for 27 people. The staff service excelled above an already high level of food and drink quality. To find an establishment that delivers attentive and friendly service on top of good food and reasonable priced drinks in ambient setting is not easy in this city but Capricci has mastered all components
5
Great food, seamless service, friendly staff and a surprise for our little 3 years old boy. Could have expected better.
Well done!!
5
We had set menu and every course was great. We also liked the friendly service that left us with the just right amount of privacy.
4
As a regular travel to Singapore I have eaten here several time and enjoy the good food. Good choice of food and. Warm welcome. Taken friends along and all have the same opionion!

Came here today with a friend for lunch to try the $15 buffet. This is a pretty simple affair consisting of a small selection of salads, some pizza, some pasta, and some chicken, and you get a drink (including a capuccino or an espresso). The salads were decent, pizza a little oily, and the chicken quite tasty. I also liked the capuccino. Desserts are also available at an extra $4 and I choce the Creme Brulee option which was fairly average. Overall for less than $20 this was great value and definitely justifies a return visit

Capricci is one of my favorite places to go either for an after work drink or to sample the excellent Italian food, cooked by the Italian owner. The Valpolicello ripasso is very good. The food is reasonably priced but cooked well. The staff, who have been there forever are knowledgable and very welcoming. At a time when restaurants, especially in Tanjong Pagar come and go in an instant Capricci is an always welcoming home

I have visited Capricci a number of times over the past few years mainly for lunches.They have a limited buffet selection at lunchtime which is amazingly cheap! I'm not a fan but I know a number of people who will not complain about it, I just prefer ordering off the menu.Pizzas are very well done, a lovely base, and quality toppings. The wine list is pretty good too but as usual in Singapore, overpriced.Definitely recommended
5
When reflecting upon the world's great cuisines, none is more creative, more colorful, more rich in the historic evolution of food than the Italian cuisine. The wine selection was all top self quality and fairly priced, given the fact we are in Singapore. Great menu to select from. If you are bored with average Italian and want a great place a great dining room, then this is the plac

We found this restaurant on the internet whilst holidaying in Singapore with another couple - what a find. We went for lunch 9th January and were welcomed to the restaurant by our waiter Mohammed. We were offered a choice - Buffet at S$15 or a la carte. Although the buffet looked great we didn't think we could eat that much so opted for the a la carte. Mohammed recommended the Buffalo Mozzarella with Parma Ham as a starter - it was the best we have eaten; where can I buy this amazing buffalo mozzarella on the Gold Coast - it was unbelievably fresh. Bread was also served; it was so good it had to have been made on the premises; I forgot to ask about this. For main, 2 x pax ordered the spaghetti with lobster & cherry tomatoes while our spouses ordered pizzas. All dishes were fabulous, as good as you would get in Italy and so well priced. The Chianti recommended by Mohammed was excellent as was the Sauvignon Blanc by the glass. Unfortunately we were too full to eat dessert but will definitely return next time in Singapore. Our waiter Mohammed was so friendly, really knew the menu well and looked after us. All in all a great meal with amazing service. Would definitely recommend

finding gold or at least silver pleases everyone. This restaurant is an unpretentious jewel that should be ranked higher than 7 in this town. Yet looks matter to some. BUT, the service and the cuisine were well worth ignoring a cement floor . Our waiter was warm and helpful. Our food arrived promptly, was well prepared and artfully arranged. The wine was also terrific. Made my 71st birthday a memorable one. Imagine a Tiramisu with a candle in it. I got my wish in this friendly place
5
the food here is awesome and has never failed to deliver. atmosphere is relaxed. we had the "tasting menu" and the chef/boss came out and served each dish himself and described how everything was done. extremely friendly and passionate about his job and you can just see how this rubs off on the staff. great place
4
Good food (very good according to hubby :) ), excellent service and excellent wine list. Be sure to try la Tunella (Friuli) and Moscato d'Asti for dessert!
4
Friendly warm hidden Italian, great staff, food was very good, but standout has to be the tuna steak for main course, fantastic flAvour, lamb good too, desert house special tiramisu and choco lava hit the nail on the head, will be returning soon !
5
Home made squid shape like pasta is fantastic, coupled with poccini mushroom....
AL DENTE is 100%
Had a pizza as well, ham was fresh and the tomatoes
5
It's an Italian restaurant with a rockabilly feel to it. The service and staff are very warm. The food is great. I've been there a couple of times and probably won't stop
5
I love this place, have been a few times now and it never fails to satisfy my cravings for good Italian food. They do my favourite pasta dish - vongole - which is excellent, and the pizzas are the best I've found in Singapore in the year I've been here. Really authentic, with a good crust.Also wine list is great, it's all reasonably priced, and the staff are lovely - I'd recommend to anyone who is yearning for a relaxed and home-style Italian meal.(Friday nights they like to crank up the music and have a bit of a dance if you're that way inclined!
4
The food and wine were delicious. The service, while a bit slow and inexperienced, was extremely friendly and not overbearing. They even called a taxi for us. We would definitely recommend taking the time to dine at Capricci! (We actually visited in September of 2013, but that wasn't an option--guess I waited too long to write the review!).--
5
After some research for Italian restaurants in Singapore to celebrate Christmas Eve at, we decided to check out this one also because of the many good reviews here. And all I can say is, we did absolutely not get disappointed! We both had the Angus Beef Steak as a main and it was absolutely fantastic. As a dessert we had the cheese platter and the lava cake and both ended our evening at the restaurant more than well. The service was really good and friendly and the place itself is really cozy and nice. It's worth to be checked out by anybody that wants really good italian food in Singapore
5
I starts with the vibe. Relaxed-urban cool. Our waiter was a great fit for the the restaurant. It was hot and we walked from Raffles. He took one look and said you guys need a beer! Following that we said bring us your favourite appetizer, main, and desert and pick a great wine. He nailed it!! The owner came out pulled up a chair and chatted. What a great night! Just writing this makes me realized I will be back even if its the other side of the world. Why Oasis-great food,location, setting, conversation and staff oh ya easy on the wallet, at least for Singapore
5
A friend of mine from Australia recommended this restaurant. I was not disappointed. I am normally very careful with pasta in restaurants but as soon as I met the owner (Massimo is from Rome) I felt comfortable in trying. It was great. The pasta was "al dente" and the homemade bread was amazing.It honestly felt like I was in Rome.Great to see that I don't have to go without my favorite dishes when I am away from home.Capricci is my restaurant of choice when next in Singapore.
5
I was attracted to this restaurant while looking for a cozy place for a dinner after a hard working day. A friendly place with fantastic food. We had the impression to be at home. good smell of home cooking. The hospitality is incredible, professional and at the same time smart. The plate of seafood gorgeous as well as pasta.Everything very fresh and delicious.thanks for the great evenin
5
Usually come here for after work drinks, always a pleasant experience. Prices are very reasonable and the food is well worth it.
Service is top notch and half the reason for coming here.
1
The pasta portions are tiny and more suited for kids. I haven't seen such small portions elsewhere in S'pore Italian restaurants. The price is the same as what other good Italian restaurants charge for full portions though. I left hungry and won't come back.
4
Great pizza. Not thick and doughy. Good topping. Very fresh. Other dishes not as good. Steak (cold) and vegetables (over cooked to state of mush). Tagliatelle with Parma (very salty). Service very good. Ambience quite nice. Reasonably priced.
5
Good food and great atmosphere. Service was good, waiters and the owner very friendly. Located on Tanjong Pagar Road, known for its picturesque, well - preserved shop houses, Capricci certainly had the scenery to match it's great food and service. Would definitely come here again.
5
Looks like a New York style place, very young, informal yet chic, and the owners do their best to make it a good experience. Food is authentic italian with a modern twist, pizzas are neither thin nor thick, light and perfect dough.
5
Capricci is a little gem on the Tanjong Pagar strip. This is real Italian food made to traditional authentic recipes and with all the right ingredients. Silky soft mozzarella, truffled mushroom risotto that was a taste bomb, 'real' pizza Napoli style, melt in the mouth with fresh tomato and basil on a light crust, beef fillet that was bursting with flavor and hardly needed a knife, then traditional desserts, tiramisu and lava cake just as they should be. The hospitality was warm and service professional. We will definitely be back
5
It was me and my father on a catch up trip after a few years of not seeing him. Well we stopped into this restaurant, and as we sat down the owner Massimo came to us making us feel at home. He's a very funny guy. Anyways, I ordered a nice pizza with prosciutto crudo e rucola then a tasteful salsiccia with polenta, while my father had a burrata and simple pasta al pomodoro. It was great, the food tasted amazing, it was super fresh and not only that but the service was also very gentile. Oh, the wine.. how could I forget about the wine. I can't get my hands on it now , but he's got a lot of great wines from anywhere you could think. We went there for all 3 nights and days we spent in Singapore. I highly recommend it

Booked a table tonight through Tripadvisor for 8.30pm, email confirmation was received. Turned up on time but they had no record of the reservation and no tables available. We were kept waiting until 9pm - despite complaints and without a single offer of a drink - and were shown to our table. Waited another 15 minutes without any service, not even a glass of water or any apology for our wait. Walked out in disgust and took our business elsewhere. The pity is that this was a trial run for a business dinner for 20 people so their lousy service just means another restaurant will get a large chunk of business.
5
I never thought that I could be eat a really Italian cousin in a country so far from Italy, location is fantastic it is on a picturesque road in the heart of Singapore very easy to reach and the ambiance was very friendly thanks to Massimo and Salvatore were very polite and professional and authentic Italian style starting from the design, but the strong point is the food, I been at lunch time and tried the rich buffet with an authentic Italian dishes with select product and regional cousin from north to south of Italy , very good the "polenta with stew" and "Pasta with zucchini and saffron" also pizza you have to try, a really outstanding wines list completed my experience in this restaurant.Price is very competitive for everybody!Luc
4
I'm one of those regulars here that drops in for a bite and a glass after all day meetings in Singapore.The proprietor Massimo tried to change the concept for a while from pretty authentic rustic fare to small portioned almost fusion recipes.Well I am happy to announce we are back to the original concept. So I say get down here for some real Italian food and great personal service!
5
wanted to eat Italian pizza and my tounge really happy with Margherita pizza, great pizza and nice place also. Recomeded for italian food lover
5
Had a great meal there! Everything from the appetizers to the lobster pasta was fantastic. If that weren't enough, the service was also great.
5
great restaurant, excellent food, friendly welcome,
the food is better than in Italy.The wine tasting was fabulous
5
I was there with 10 friends and we had a great evening with delicious food and a very good and friendly service. Will definitely go again!
5
We booked the place after reading TA reviews and it was just delicious !!! Food is truly excellent, so many things look so appetizing on the menu! we went for the 72 hours rising pizza dough and a dish of home made pork sausage, all absolutely yummy !!! service is also perfect, friendly and attentive ! we will go back there again !!!

We are a family of four. Two adults and two children (10 and 13). We enjoyed a very pleasant evening at Capricci. We ate;One Margherita Pizza - $16Maguro tuna Tartare - $19Cold Cuts and Cheese - $22Orange and Fennel Salad - $14Spaghetti with Lobster - $26Risotto with mushrooms and pumpkin - $26Tiramisu - $14Several soft drinks2 glasses red wine - $14 each2 glasses white - $11 eachThe Italian chef is making some interesting and truly tasty food. The spaghetti with lobster was outstanding as was the risotto as. Our family all agreed that the tiramisu was one of the best we had ever eaten. The restaurant is conveniently located just a stone's throw from Chinatown and has a casual atmosphere with very good wait staff. There is also a very good wine list. Would we go back - sure thing. Highly recommended
5
My husband and I chose to eat at Capricci on our last evening in Singapore and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. There were so many dishes on the menu that we would have liked to try - we just wished that we hadn't waited until the end of the holiday to visit! For us the portion sizes were just right, enabling us to indulge in 3 courses! The staff were all very friendly and welcoming and we liked the simple decor. A great place to go if you like Italian food
5
After much deliberation we settled on Capricci for a meal to mark a very special occasion. The gentleman I spoke to on the phone guaranteed me the ‚Äòbest seat in the house‚Äô and very politely confirmed my reservation. We arrived and were shown to the wine cellar, a private room with dedicated, controllable air conditioning surrounded by the restaurant‚Äôs wine collection. It was the perfect size to fit two and had clouded glass walls so that we didn‚Äôt feel completely isolated. The setting really was wonderful. The restaurant has recently changed its menu and now focusses on small portions for a slightly lower price. We had 3 courses and found this to be the perfect amount. All of the food was superb and one small error where we were brought the wrong dishes was met with heartfelt apologies and a complimentary savoury pepper mousse each. The wine selection was also excellent with a suggestion made to accompany each dish. The meal came to around $160++ for two people, making it significantly cheaper than most of the competitors in the TripAdvisor top 10. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience at Capricci and would highly recommend it
4
Even though I don't live in Singapore anymore, I continue to send my visiting friends to Capricci because I know what they can expect from this place. I was a regular before leaving the country, and even though the restaurant has seen different chefs and concepts, the main hits of the restaurant have remained. My friends are always happy when they go (most tend to be Italian tourists in search of a taste of home), so I'm going to continue betting on these guys.Definitely try their lamb, their melanzane alla parmigiana, and their fish tartare/ avocado combination. Home runs
4
Very slow service but solid Italian cooked food cooked with passion. Ambience was ok but not as good as say Rossi vino. We had pasta starter and pizza for main. Pasta was very good and pizza was pretty good but not as good as Italian thin crust pizza from Italy
5
Went to Capricci to celebrate Valentine's Day, and was hugely satisfied with the experience. Warm friendly and efficient service, along with great food. The beef was really tender and juicy. The desserts are a must try. The wine selection is amazing as well!
5
Great ambience and excellent food. I felt at home being there enjoying the food and drinks from the full bar.
5
Dine at Capricci under suggestion of few friends. the food was great, tasty and well done. Service was good and everyone was polite and pleasant. Heard about the generous lunch buffet and i actually planned to visit them again. Kudos to Capricci. Bravo!
5
We held an event at Capricci on 20 Sep 2014 and were very pleased with the 3-course meal paired with Italian wines! The staff were also very friendly and helpful in ensuring the event ran smoothly. A definite recommendation!!
5
We went for a good pizza and a bottle of red wine and were extremely satisfied. The atmosphere and service were great and relaxed, the food and wine tasted Italian.
5
It's always a pleasure to eat and drink at capricci's. The food is excellent every time I visit and the staff super friendly. You feel like you're taken care of like being part of family. I can highly recommend capricci's if you're out for Italian food and drinks.:
3
My boyfriend and I went to Capricci for a quick meal before our evening activity. It is quite expensive and I think for what you get that could do better elsewhere. However, the quality of the food was good and perhaps if we were not in such a rush we would have ordered wine or another course
5
Was in Singapore 2 weeks for business trip. After the first week, having tried each and every type of Asian cuisine, I decided it was time to go back that of the country I am from... Hence I picked Capricci from Trip Advisor top list and I could not have made any better choice.I was served a starter on the house as soon as I sat down. I took than a fish based main course followed from a delicious tiramisu. Fantastic!The owner and his wife welcomed me very nicely and spent about half an hour talking about the city and advising about places to visit etc.The restaurant is very nice and, needless to say, the food is great. Highly recommended
4
Came here for dinner and it really did feel like a European setting. The food was absolutely delicious.... Even the spinach and ricotta flan type thing which I thought I may regret! We tried a pizza and pasta for main and could not fault either of them. The staff were helpful yet discreet throughout. Food prices were generally reasonable and for 1 stater and 2 mains came to about √Ç¬£35ish. But as everywhere in this part of the world a pretty normal bottle of wine doubled the cost of our meal.
5
Authentic pizza cooked as it should be. Excellent food and great service all at reasonable prices including the wine. Venue resembles a true Italian Trattoria but in Singapore - tasty food as you would expect if you were in Italy. Highly recommended and I will definitely visit again on my next trip
5
I went for a casual dinner at Capricci restaurant, it was a great success. Traditional Italian food in a cool lofty environment. The owner Massimo knows how to treat his guests. Really worth to try!
5
Nice People, Great Food and a wonderful dining experience. Made us feel very very welcome, the owners are great friendly people.
5
We enjoyed our dinner time here. Ordered some kinds of food but we enjoyed Pizza very much. The manager and staffs were funny and helpful. Also, it was not too expensive and you can find a great meal with great value here. Enjoy !!
5
Great food served by botak and bogey! The food was fantastic, love every dish we ordered especially the pizza! Thanks for making it a wonderful dinner date for us! Will definitely return to try other dishes
4
We sat down and we're taken care of immediately. The menu is of the right size, not too much and not too little to choose from. The same goes for the wine list where we chose a 2007 Barbera. An unusual find in Singapore. The staff were quick to acknowledge my preference for changes and adjustment to both the starter and the main course and while waiting for the former we got a small appetizer. The starter, lobster tartar, was very nice although also very small and so was the main course, Tuna Tagliata. In return we got an extra side dish for free. All in all, very good and I will go back.
2
The service is super top notch. Excellent and well taken care of. The Italian bread are superb. However, the main courses were disappointing. It was too salty, poor texture and lack fragrance. For the price they are charging, the food quality is so not worth it. Servings were small too. Disappointing.
5
Four of us enjoyed a casual tasty night. On seating we met Max, the owner and chef who welcomed us like regular customers, not the tourists we were. The menu was great value and we enjoyed some salads and carpaccio together with complimentary pizza Bianca. Trying to decide on the wine we were offered tastes of the Italian and Australian. Being parochial we chose the latter. For Singapore the prices were incredibly reasonable. The males ordered the pistachio crumbed lamb which was enjoyed but being farmers we thought they were hogget and not quite as tender as lamb. Another pizza was shared for the main. The expresso was great. We had a lovely relaxed meal at a great price
5
For lunch time during weekdays we tried Capricci with its buffet at 12 dollars nett. We were not sure what we would find for that price. What a good surprise : the service is dynamic and pleasant, the restaurant room very nice, good music, not too noisy. Perfect! The buffet is simple but products are good : salad bar with good products, pizza (simple and good) plus two type of pasta. The best value for money I tried in Singapore
4
The food servicing sizes are like Europe and perfect so you don't end up eating huge portion sizes. You must have the Burratta . It's very fresh and delicious. Also highly recommended us the family secret the lamb chops with pistachio crumbs. Absolutely stunning. They sat us in a private room which was like a wine cellar. You can also rent the ace for a private party. Great vibe.

My wife and I were wandering Tanjong Pagar Road looking for a place that offered some variety, atmosphere and good food - upon Capricci we stumbled and loved the place. It's well situated, with a deep, interesting interior, our favourite spot was on the big 4 seat sidewalk table that put us outside with a great street view. There were many quality things about this restaurant, number one is the service - friendly, relaxed, personal, funny, attentive and real. As vegetarians, the menu was limited but what we did have was delicious, well-prepared and filling. We liked the place so much we returned for a second visit, and our gracious host Mahafi had the chef make us something unique based on one of the standard menu items. A family-run business with dedicated staff, this place has a lot going for it and one would be quite satisfied with an evening there whether on a date, a family event, friends or even a business get-together. Only drawback was the proximity to the neighbouring nightclub, which would open their side door and overwhelm the street with the cheezy tunes of their house band. Other than that, the place is great and highly recommended when in Singapore and wanted quality food in a great area with wonderful service
5
The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere, and the pizzas are divine. The price is very much reasonable for the quality of food. Our waiter was courteous and the food was made very quickly. 10/10, would come here again.
5
The food was awesome !!! Love the ambience as well; will definitely be back!! Must try for all Italian food lovers out there!
5
It took three years of living in Singapore to finally find a great Italian Restaurant. Try the barrata salad, pistachio crusted lab chops or any of their pizzas. Seriously one of the best staffs in Singapore. Massimo the chef and staff make you feel very welcome. We have gone here two Friday nights in a row and might just make it a standing dinner date
4
The prevailing charm of Capricci is an unspoilt honesty. The staff are attentive but not intrusive, yet they are not dressed in blinding whites. The premises are functional and clean but simple. The food is excellent and interesting but nobody wrings their hands over the plating.The head waiter is a breath of fresh air for anyone who has had to contend with pushy or disinterested waitstaff. He is friendly, he listens, and he is helpful; then, he is gone until needed.We had heard that there was a set menu, but there was nothing on the printed menu. He offered a 4 course for 88SGD - sounds good, but what would it be? He suggested we leave it to the chef, and checked for any undesired foods.He later announced that the Chef was having such a good time (possibly also that we asked for the Chef's suggestion on a wine pairing for our mystery menu), that a 5th course was to be included in the price. He appeared when necessary and otherwise left us to enjoy our meal.We started with a simply lovely sea bass tartar in a ginger marinade with orange zest. Then it was homemade spaghetti with lobster. Then the surprise fish plate, again sea bass, which was terrifically moist and tender. Then was the steak: it was small and likely the tail end of a tenderloin, but it was cooked so well and tenderly . . . well, I did not think I could afford good steak in Singapore after my "prime" ribeye experience at Luke's.Dessert was vanilla ice cream and chocolate lava cake.The beauty of the dishes was found in the preparation, not the presentation. There was no reliance on making a pretty plating - just a clean white canvas and a little art in the middle. The tartar had great texture and flavor. The spaghetti was properly al dente, whole wheat, and had a coarse surface texture that made it simply more interesting than machine-pressed. The cooked bass was fresh and light, and the steak was a perfect medium rare.Capricci delivers an unpretentious dining experience. And if you're there for a date, try the chef's-choice set menu and let an expert tell you what is good
5
My wife and I had dinner here the first time just after Chinese New Year - which meant that we could actually get a table without reservation. What is there to say about this restaurant? Fantastic chef, very personable Italian guy. Moreover - simply, very, very good food. Truly wonderful. Service was excellent too and pricing very reasonable. Fantastic place and we happily come here regularly now
5
Well, I had the buffet lunch there, for an outrageous 12$!! The variety of fare available for lunch is amazing! Even Pizza is there, the Tomato soup, all the Focaccia bread for free, the Vegetables and of course a Pasta dish! Salads, dressings all homemade. Chef Massimo and his crew are great, and I'm going to recommend this Lunch Buffet to my friends, take notice, it gets busy, I eat lunch earlier than most, so I have no problem getting a table
5
It was a pleasure to have dinner here. The staff were extremely welcoming and friendly from the beginning. The chef was also able to make vegetarian items not listed on the menu, which I greatly appreciated. The food was amazing, especially the quality of the sauces. I also appreciated that while this was a nice restaurant, the atmosphere was not formal or stuffy. Prices were also very reasonable. I would be happy to eat here again on my next trip to Singapore
4
Had lunch with my girls today n was impressed with the quality of food n professional level of service. Overheard the waiter explaining company's policy to reduce usage of water by encouraging customers to use their personal plate again. I like that; we all can play a part in the sustainable n eco movement. Can take small steps each time as we change the way we do things. Well done n keep up the good work(food/service) j
5
I went to Capricci with a girlfriend and it was one of our best experience in terms of food and ambience. We had the Pan Seared Squid and Tuna Tartare to start off our dinner, followed by Steak for myself and Seabass for Becky. We had the House Chianti Red to go with our meal. What I like about Capricci is the plate size.... it was not overpowering. They served appetising size that left you enough room to enjoy your main course. After, we still have room to share a dessert. We felt much more complete and satisfied for able to go through to dessert. Also, the prices were good, cos they charged reasonably according to the plate size. We each paid around Sgd60 for our meal. Not bad, huh? ;) I heard the pizza were great. Will try it on my next visit.....If you like to have a drink or two to relax, it is an open concept restaurant with a long communal table outside that you can chill or make new contacts... thought that was really cool...
5
One must try this little paradise for real Italian food gourmet.I finally found a place where I can eat enjoying the superb Italian cuisine without getting stuffed or coming out still starving!!!If you love Italian food and love "tasting & enjoying food" rather than experience strange combination platters, then you must go. Pasta like your "mum's" one and with a touch of super professionalism.Definitely will be back Massimo and Davide. Just wait for my next trip to the lion city..
5
We've been there few times..and always left satisfied with the great food and service.
The Owner is very attentive and friendly too.
And lastly, must try : the lobster pasta! Loved it!
5
One of my favorite place when i go to Singapore.
Excellent food, nice atmosphere.
The Owner's Passion also makes the difference and if you are not familiar with the food served,
follow his advice, you won't regret :)
2
I had very high expectations reading the reviews. I was aware the place would be expensive (only one thing everyone seemed to agree on), so I expected both quality and quantity. Neither was there. Averge food and expensive. Nothing exceptional about the setting.
5
Food was amazing and well priced for Singapore. Wine Selection was suitable and well priced. Had a couple of pizza's and some other share plates. Was a good experience with good company
5
Got to admit it's not my first time going to capricci (that says a lot) ! It's really really good. I mean the home made chilli is amazing and the pizzas are just phenomenal! Don't make me start on the pastas! Every now and then I would have cravings for their paccheri. Staff is always welcoming and the atmosphere is super chill. What's not to love? It has the whole package and no pretense
5
I was curious to try chef Davide Tonel's touch and I went to Capricci last Friday. I ask if I could have something slightly different and ordered some mixed appetizers and a pizza made to my wish. The staff, always very caring and attentive, presented me with a fantastic platter with Calamari, Beef Tartare with Parmigiano, tortino of Ricotta & Spinach, Tortino of Aubergines, Tuna Tartare with Avocado mousse, Italian ham. My pizza featured Parma Ham & Burrata. It was all so delicious that both me & my guest were very happy. Not only that, it did not really bore a hole in my pocket! Chef Davide told me that if I was interested in regional recipes they could be available if I were to let him know in advance. I am sure that his interpretations of my "capricci" will be tasty, and I would certainly recommend Capricci to everybody. Last but not least, I discovered their lunch buffet at a nearly hawker centre price. Capricci is a gem
5
Second time to this nice restaurant to try the new chef in chrge Davide Tonel and his friendly concept made of smaller portions at reasonable price. We try totally 9 course and the food was delectable for execution and presentation. The owner Massimo was right you can try many things without getting stuffed like a Christmas turkey and leaving your salary behind. Well done Capricc
2
Went to Capricci on a Friday night for dinner with family. Maybe it was just a bad day but nothing went right:1) The food was terrible. The pasta had enough chilli to kill a horse.2) They were understaffed and it took over 15 min to catch the attention of anyone.The saving grace was the mushroom soup - If your night goes the same way as ours it could provide some succor
5
Capricci is a wonderful little restaurant, which has an amazing variety of explicitly tasting food with really nice staff! Eating at the Capricci with its wonderful choice of Italian specialities, the chilled, relaxed atmosphere and with their happy, funny and easy going staff the dine at Capricci was a real delight! Its defiantly worth trying
5
Got lucky and discovered this place on the 2nd day of their new menu with new chef. All fantastic, from Tuna and Scallops starters to beef and sea bass/pasta mains. Will be back to explore more for sure. Located in Tanjong Pagar area of Singapore a few doors down from Maxwell Hawker Centre. 20% discount on mains before 8pm....even more amazing! $55 bottle of Chianti was fantastic too
5
We really enjoyed the capreze salad, the prawn risotto, and the customized vegetarian pasta! Many ingredients were home made, which made it even more special. We loved it!
5
Very nice field warm and the owner and management very professional.
If you go in there will enjoi very and unforgettable experience spelly friday and saturady evening
5
Celebrated a birthday party here and the hostess - Lyn took excellent care of us. Food was delicious. Great atmosphere. Must come.
5
Went for lunch. Price very reasonable and food good and with variety. Had the buffet. I really recommend the place. The owner Massimo was very kind and went the extra mile to accommodate my needs! Very good
5
I have a great experience in this restaurant, the personnel was very attentive and prevenant.
The best singapore pizzeria for me.
Trust me and go there

Overall a very enjoyable dinner, prices very reasonable but please note that even the main entres are tapas size...Service - very good - our hostess Lynn ensured that we were comfortable and things went smoothlyFood - good and fresh. Beef and seafood we ordered was goodDessert - we had lava cake and tiramisu - goodworth a tr

We came here for a business lunch, but got the feeling that this was more of an informal lunch venue, especially given the SGD 10 buffet option which most of the customers seemed to have opted for.My guest was a bit put out by the distinctly informal atmosphere, but luckily we were allowed to move into the 'private room' which is enough to seat 4 and has its own aircon and provides a nice discreet oasis from the rest of the restaurant. My client had the spinach tart, which turned out to be a very pleasant souffle; I had the tuna tartare which was good too. My friend then had the lobster linguine which he thoroughly enjoyed and I had the pasta with homemade sausage which was fine, if not spectacular. We had a pleasant Pinot Grigio to start with at SGD 80 and then followed with an excellent Brunello Di Montalcino for SGD 85 which I thought was good value.This is a good place for lunch, although it has to be said that Nicolas Le Restaurant is significantly more deserving of its position in the Singapore ranking - Capricci must have some very good friends writing reviews on their behalf......

We visited this restaurant after reading positive reviews and glad we did.Nice atmosphere and our waiter was very helpful and friendly. My husband had steak and I had risotto which was well cooked. We shared tiramisu which was to die for.Restaurant is not cheap but we had a lovely meal and would definitely go back to

If you are looking for a nice place to have your lunch or dinner in Tanjong Pagar/China Town area, this is a great deal!!!Lunchtime there is an Italian buffet you can have amazing and fresh Italian food for just $10, (6 euro/8 usd), so far I didn't found a cheaper place (quality wise)!!!Pizza is homemade, Chef and Massimo the owner are REAL italian, staff is super warming and the place is cozy;The only thing I do not like is that they are closed on sundays, it is a great place to chill as well and sometimes I feel like going there on sundays, do not be like... me do not go on sundays!!

I have been on travel to Singapore twice in the past two months. A Friend of mine was also in town and recommended we try and find a small quaint little Italian Place called Capricci. The owners are a husband and wife both Native Italians and both fantastic at making the entire occasion a wonderful experience. Massimo is the Chef and can fix any dish any way you want it. Lynnda is the Charm and energy of the establishment. High energy and fabulous hosting skills like I've never seen before. If you have a special occasion try to get reservations for one of the two table in the wine cellar. The Past, Pizza, Steaks, Brucetta, and param ham with buffalo mozzarella is fantastic. So if in Singapore go enjoy a great place to eat with even better employees that make it a great experience!

This Italian resto was amazing, the service, food, etc... The hospitality of the chef and his wife is TOP.

Really nice place open to the street without too much A/C. Good food, fair prices and a very service minded staff. Highly recommended.

I'm here on Business from USA and of course the hotels don't reccommend any restaurants or they just don't take the time to list options for their guests. Anyway, I took a chance and walked along Tanjong Pagar Road in Chinatown section looking for potentially what I found. I must have gotten there a little early, maybe 6:00 pm and it seemed dark and quiet at first since they were just opening I think. I looked and and thought hmm, asked to see a menu more hmmmmmm and after talking to the waiter I decided to sit and give it a try. Massimo, Lin and his staff were very accomodating. The food freshness, presentation and taste was magnificent.......excellent quality and value. I enjoyed every aspect from the apps, wine, dinner and dessert. So great, I'm going back again tonight :)Byron, NJ US

My wife and I went rather late to dinner at Capricci which is located near to Singapore's China Town area. The owner Massimo was very welcoming and personally greeted us and showed us to a nice table and he really pampered us all evening. Massimo is passionate about his restaurant and it shows in the quality of food and service. The restaurant has a rather nice bar scene, bit loud music kind of 70's and 80's pop/rock Santana, Air supply etc which for us was really nice to and it added to the relaxed chilled out atmosphere. They have boutique Italian bottled beers and I tried one called "Curmi" recommended by Massimo and it was fabulous. Starters of a porcini flan and a plate of crispy calamari and prawn were excellent. We shared a margherita pizza for the main, it was done with a special Burrata cheese (which is a kind of soft Mozzarella from Veneto area) was to die for! The thin crusty pizza base was one of the best I have ever had and reminded me of the little pizza restaurants in Rome's Tiburtina quarter. Pistachi ice cream was also really fantastico! I highly recommend this restaurant for if your looking for good food in a very chilled out relaxed atmosphere

My wife and I have been to many Italian restaurants in Singapore. I have to say, Capricci restaurant serves up the best authentic Italian food in Singapore. Not only is the food delicious and priced reasonable, but the attention to detail is impeccable. Not to mention the service, which is the best in town
5
I spent here lunch and dinner in my stayng in Singapore , Lunch quickly delicious and cheap with the rich buffet that they propose apart of the menu, with salads soups pasta pizzas accuratetly prepared by two italian chefs, great variety of wines and beers I was realy surprized to find the best italian wines in this place..and in the evening for a dinner a little more special I indulge on the dishes of the menu...I'm Italian and i tell you this guys ...rules!! no kidding the chefs loves their jobs and you can test it ...you can enjoy your dinner surrounded by a cordial and fun atmoshere ... I definetely suggest this place my favorite in Singapore ...enjoy it ;

Me and my husband love Italian food so wanted to try out Capricci. We had a reservation at 8pm, but our table wasn't ready when we arrived so they kept us waiting in the bar for more than 20min without asking if we wanted to have something to drink. It seemed as the staff were arguing with each other and the atmosphere were a bit awkward. Eventually, when one of the staff approached us, asking us if we wanted to order drinks, it felt like we had to excuse us for being there. Not very welcoming.We had to wait about 15 min more to just get our table that we actually had a reservation on. Both of us were starving!To be fair, our waiter at the table was friendly. Food wise, nothing special. I had a tuna tartar as appetizer which was quite blend and contained some tough bites, difficult to chew.For main course, I ordered a Pistachio crusted lamb rack. I only got 2 small racks on my plate (both overcooked) and the pistachios were overwhelming not leaving room for any other flavors. Their basil pannacotta dessert was the only dish that I really liked, smooth texture and great flavours.All in all, I can't believe that this restaurant is ranked this high on Trip Advisor. Neither me or my husband liked the place very much. We won't pay another visit as there are a lot of much better (and affordable) Italian restaurants in Singapore.

We arrived to a warm welcome from the head waiter and were promptly seated. Menus arrived requests for water were action and everything seemed just right.We ordered an entree and main each. The wine list is quite good we had an excellent Italian pinot grigo yes a little expensive but this is Singapore.The entrees were excellent actually my partner ordered the antipasto which came without any pickled vegetables, the waiter was happy to organise some. The mains were equally as good.I note that some reviewers were critical of this restaurant - for us it was a really good evening. We come to Singapore 2 or 3 times a year and on the night we went we found warmth, friendliness, professionalism good food and wine. What more could one expect
1
Im a fan of italian food and usually biased to always rate italian restaurant high. Visited the restaurants with low expectations and sadly our expectations were confirmed. For example the pistacchio lamb, it came in as a lollipop style covered with pistacchios. More nuts than lamb.. I have to say its a great tourist trap though.
5
I have been to Capricci severe times and is one of my favorites in Singapore. I had the Halibut this time and was outstanding. Pizza is also very good. What make Capricci is the atmosphere. Quaint, always have great classic rock music playing. Plus, the owners are hands on. I would definitely give this a try
2
We went based on the number one ranking..average food..pasta was not fully cooked, and when we asked them to fix it, turned up overcooked. will not go again
5
this is where tripadvisor helps! Capricci had a great rating, and it lived up to it. Small place, pretty trendy, very italian, of course. Great food and great ambiance.

Food is good tossed with some nice wine for an evening dinner . Good quality Italian food but service is slow . Must try
5
This place never fail to impress. Went for dessert only. Service was excellent! All the desserts we ordered all super delicious! We had some drinks too. The Grappe is fantastic and wine selection very good.
Will definitely returned for more!!
4
Went for their buffet lunch at S$10 nett. It's good value for money. Salad - fresh and deliciousPizza - the best!Pasta - taste food but insufficient ingredients Soup - ok but not fantasticBread - generous servings of different types of breadWorth a try if you are in the area.
5
Capricci serves great authentic italian food in a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. No "fettuccine alfredo" style pseudo italian meals but original dishes that are perfectly prepared. Had the tagliata di manzo which was very tasty and cooked to perfection. The menu is not extensive but absolutely sufficient as the variety of dishes is great. Service was super friendly as well! Chief Massimo always has an eye on everything and makes sure everybody feels very well looked after. All in all great restaurant with reastaurant with reasonable prices as wel
4
We recently went to Capricci for Valentine's Day Dinner. Great Ambience and lively atmosphere. Five course dinner was stuffed somehow in Three courses using really small portions, which was a let down. Risotto Porcini was the best. The actual portion with the main course was small as chutney but a request to the owner Massimo got us extra portion which was fantastic to the last morsel. We will visit again whenever there is a strong craving for an authentic Italian Risotto
5
A great find in Singapore. A small unpretentious restaurant in Duxton Hill. We went there for St Valentine's Day. Service was slow, but I am sure every restaurant would have faced this issue as they all scrammed to maximise the evening by having multiple seatings etc. Food was amazingly good and the staff were very apologetic and did explain the reason for the delay. We will definitely return as the food was very authentic and reasonably priced for Singapore
5
My husband and I came here for dinner and it was by far our favourite meal. We heard about Capricci through Trip Advisor and it was a great choice. I had the lobster pasta and my husband had the sleeved pasta with sausage. We shared the walnut and pear salad. It was all perfectly cooked (this is coming from two HUGE Italian food lovers). I had a bottle of the house Pinot Grigio and it was delicious. If we were in Singapore longer, we definitely would've gone back again. There are lots of bars in the area if that's what you like. We took a 5-10 minute cab to "Clarke Quay" which is an awesome block of bars.
5
Found this restaurant on tripadvisor and went there during our short stay in Singapore. Wasn't a mistake for sure. Not quite a fine-dining option, but the service was excellent, with a real personal attitude and concern. Took a tasting menu which came in a format of two small portions per plate. Was very generous amount of food in the end letting us absorb more of Italian homemade delicacies. Thank you, mr. Waiter (unfortunately, forgot to ask your name) for your professionalism and care. Will return when we are in Singapore again

Very good food (la pannacotta eccezionale!!). Authentic Italian cuisine with a touch of creativity. Friendly atmosphere. Impeccable service. Very good quality/price ratio.

Nice food and great hospitality!!! Thank you very much and I will be back soon. Please try carpaccio and tuna steak, like!! Like!! Like!!

Excellent staff, food and price . With the same taste of the traditional Italian pizza .

What a wonderful experience, as many others have said in previous reviews this is truly an exceptional place to dine, food and presentation are excellent with true Italian taste, staff and service is impeccable, not in a stuffy way, but with due care and attention and always with a smile and ready to give advise.We had the degustation menu and it was mouthwatering from the maguro tuna with avocado, the risotto, the pasta with italian sausage and porcini, the sea bass,the lamb and then the strudel and tirramisu to end.......wow what a delight.Massimo, the owner, is a real character, with nice stories to tell and what stands out is that there is no ill words about his competitors, for him they are friends.The place oozes attention and care not only in the service but in the taste of each dish and then there is the wine, a good selection to choose from and I would thoroughly recommend the Cignale a true Super Tuscan Red.Complimenti Massimo and staff you have a "gem" and we will be back for sure in the very near future.Grazi

We are regulars at Capricci now, having stumbled into the place by accident when our previous go-to Italian restaurant was fully booked a year or so ago. Since that first visit we have returned maybe a dozen times - simply because the food is consistently superb, it's a nice relaxing atmosphere to sit in, and the service by the waiters is most unlike the rest of Singapore: attentive, intelligent, informal but professional, and with common sense. The two waiters who have been there some time clearly know the food and wine they serve, which helps. I recommend the spinach flan for the appetiser (they used to call it a souffl√É¬©, but the product hasn't changed: it's delicious). The tuna tartare is also delicious. Their risotti are both delicious, as are the pasta dishes (especially the salsicca one). The lamb cutlets are divine, and the pizzas perfect (they also do take away). I haven't yet had a bad wine from them - their prosecco is dry enough for me and their reds are well chosen: no vinegar here. Desserts are so good that you have to have one regardless of how full you are. Top it off with a limoncello and for a couple of hours, we feel like we've escaped back to Italy without the hassle of flying. Of course, part of the charm of the place is that it's quite small (and well decorated), so it often feels intimate and relaxed. On that note I should tell you not to visit... I'd like to keep it for myself please

When I wrote my first review of 'Capricci' ("Wrong place at the wrong time redux?") on 21 October 2013, I was less than complimetary about the establishment. This was mainly due to the disruption caused by an inebriated and very loud large group of diners. The experience was mitigated by the skilful intervention of owner Massimo Agauro, but not to the extent where I felt I could give a rating of more than 'average'. Massimo was upset by my review, but I assured him I would return and that if I had a 5 star experience I would let the world know about it. Fellow diners, I returned last night and can confirm that it was indeed a 5 star experience and you should know about it. Noticeably, there were no large or noisy groups of diners (in fact Massimo advised that since my review Management have been very strict in ensuring that clients do not get overly boisterous to the detriment of the dining experience of other guests). I ordered a bottle of Lis Neris pinot grigio (a reasonable $80++), a stonking Antinori Guado al Tasso (a wallet heavy $290++) and waited for my guest to turn up. One feature of Singapore restaurants that I find unecessarily intrusive is the constant background music, which is invariably more foreground. Whilst conversation was not strained it was just over the decibel level I would have been happy with. That said, I have not heard Al Stewart's 'Year of the Cat' played anywhere for about 25 years. Massimo, who was busy preparing pizzas, served up, straight from the oven, a super thin sliced pizza base dosed with salt and rosemary - delicious. When my guest arrived we both decided to try the chef's 4 course degustation menu ($88++). To our surpise what we had assumed was a fish "or" meat option in the first three courses was actually fish "and" meat. Accordingly, the first course comprised tuna tartare with creamed avocado topped with sliced almonds on one side of the plate and beef tenderloin carpaccio (hammered to a thin slice) on rucola topped with parmesan and chopped tomato on the side - delicious. The second course brought us prawn and asparagus risotto paired with paccheri pasta and a homemade sausage and mushroom creamy sauce - delicious. This was followed by cod on a creamy chilli sauce complimentated by a pistachio crusted lamb chop on a creamy saffron sauce (some may find the nuts smother the lamb somewhat) - delicious. Finally, the pudding paired apple strudel with melting ice cream with Capricci's signature tiramisu - delicious. A couple of glasses of grappa complimented a very enjoyable dining experience. The service was excellent and Massimo was masterfully attentive throughout. Dear reader, did I mention that the food was delicious? It is and you should try it

I went there for company Xmas party, the services and food in this restaurant were fabulous. This restaurant reminds me some of my favorite restaurants in Gas lamp Quarter in San Diego and Lygon Street in Melbourne, Australia. We had set menu and every course was yummy.My husband liked pistachio crusted lamb and I liked the Kurobuta Pork Cheek. Their "32" beer is one of the kind. Should try when you are in Singapore.Mrs H

We had a tasty little trip to Italy! A quiet night just before New Years we had the place practically for ourselves. Excellent food, wine and a little extra of owen-fresh focaccia. We also liked the friendly service that left us with the just right amount of privacy
5
We went to this place for the 2nd time recently. I'm happy to say all of the good memories from our 1st trip were reconfirmed with interest.The staff are warm and attentive but not overbearing. The food is some of the best Italian I've ever eaten. The wine list is excellent, even the house wines r very drinkable. And the prices are very reasonable for both food and drink.Can't wait to go back again!
5
Excellent restaurant with top quality food. The service was attentive and professional and it's obvious the staff have been very well trained. loved the atmosphere and everything about it. We will definitely be back The chef spoke to all customers to ensure they were happy and the food was magic!! Thank You Massim
5
Food was amazing and staff were very friendly - love this place and would definitely go back when visiting Singapore.
4
Went there for lunch with my colleague. The food was autuaclly quite nice and price was reasonable. However the service was quite average and really slow.
5
Capricci is special. The boss and his team are warm, welcoming and cannot do enough to make sure you enjoy your visit. I have been many times both for lunch, dinner and after work drinks. Never been disappointed, always leave with a smile.
5
The set menu here was an excellent choice, and well priced too. Paired it with wine, and we had a meal that will have us wanting ot go back! Staff were good too
5
For a good value deal, you get a main + semi buffet with water.All food is prepared FRESH and HEALTHY with minimal cream in soups & thin crispy pizza crusts.Salad is fresh and well displayed, soup is great tasting and pizzas are hot.Pasta is lightly sauced to avoid feeling "saturated" with cream/cheese and all condiments are available.Ambience is nice and great! Staff service is good as well! Great place all again
5
Everything about our meal here was top notch. For a start we were seated in the private room in the wine cellar (it pays to book in advance). I had the executive lunch - 3 courses for about $35 - excellent value for money, and the food was great. The parma ham starter with mozzarella is very tasty, the cheese is perfectly soft in the middle, and it is large - would easily serve 2. The other courses were also very good. Service was also excellent, and the ambience great. Well worth a visit
5
Professional service, clean, good decor and excellent food!I had linguine with vongole and bottarga, rare to find, my daughter had pizza with rucola e crudo.Being from Naples area I am very demanding on my pizza, I had almost half of it and was very good. On top of it the owner started to play with my 6 years old daughter making her feeling home.We had good time and good food, for sure will go back!
5
If you like good Italian food, don't miss this restaurant.The service is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy and the friendly owner help me to choose the right food.I had Paccheri with Italian sausage, and my husband and I agreed that Tiramisu is the best one in here. I absolutely addicted it.The price is not so high, it's worth for the quality of the food.I'll definitely go back again for more

My family and I were visiting China town and we came across this Italian restaurant by chance . We were encouraged by the rating in trip advisor so went in with high expectations, only to be disappointed by the average standard quality it offers. The buffet may be cheap at 10S$ but it offers a very basic variety of dishes...I picked the lamb from the menu and it took ages to come...The manager ( who was very nice and considerate) was very apologetic about the unreasonable delay and offered free ice cream to the kids, but I guess the damage was done...
5
Instead of the regular Tuesday night badminton, my friends and I decided to go for an Italian dinner. Really odd way of replacing exercise night. and to make things more fun, we looked for a place that all of us haven't tried before and this where our feet took us. Food and service are both excellent and we did not regret every dish we ordered. Here's a few: risotto has a nice texture and balance, sleeve pasta with sausage and mushrooms (gosh I cannot pronounce the true name) is really good, and the pork with asparagus and pumpkin puree is exceptional. Dessert is really good, too! Will definitely visit again
5
We went to this place in our last night in Singapore. Really Nice atmosfere and so Nice People! The food and wine was great and we were really Happy about it! :) Norwegian and Brazilian.
4
Fantastic experience, staff made you feel special and the food was very very good. The suggestions
By owner & staff on menu choices was perfect for the true Italian experience.
5
We're incredibly lucky that this is one of our local eateries, as it means we can eat here as often as we like. The service really sets this friendly restaurant apart. Waiting staff that remember where you sat last time you ate there, the wine you chose, and your meal choices, so that if you're struggling to decide what to eat they can volunteer your previous options; cherries thrown onto children's fruit juices to make them feel extra special - little things like this make a huge difference to the eating out experience.Fortunately the food lives up to the high standards of the service. The complimentary fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar is utterly moreish. The oil is like liquid gold and I have to force myself to stop dipping. It's not easy!There are so many good, fantastically prepared, Italian dishes on offer here that I would struggle to recommend just one. For a family with a teenager and a five year old to satisfy, I must say that the pizzas hit the spot perfectly - proper, oven baked pizzas with simple, well balanced toppings, that aren't smothered in oil and cheap cheese.The ambience is fabulous too - simple yet elegant, with quirky pop culture references, and a great sound track. We love the 1980s pop tunes that sometimes play out - obviously our era!This restaurant is as good for a relaxed family dinner as it is for a twinkling romantic meal. It's beautiful and I thoroughly recommend it

Working in Tajong Pagar, I went to give a try to Capricci which opened few years ago.I wasn't disappointed as for lunch we took the "Lunch Formula" which consist in a buffet, with the option to add some dishes a la carte. The buffet is just right for lunch, choices of Fresh salad( that you can create yourself), home pizzas and fresh pasta... ALL for S$10 only.... And for that price you get the quality and freshness of the food.... Plus the smile of the staff....After that we decided to try it for Dinner, and we are happily surprised as the Chef was doing a Special Menu. Of course we decided to go for it, and everything was just delicious.... Perfectly cooked and season and again you can taste the freshness of the ingredient... Not to forget their Happy Hour, with a nice wine selection and beers...I will highly recommend this place, for business lunch, with friends or your partner... Love it...
5
We were in Singapore staying near Tanjong Pagar Road so our friend recommended that we have dinner at Capricci. It was a wonderful meal for us! Top marks in all areas.The place was beautiful! Nice ambience. We brought our infant chld along so they gave us this small room where we could have the baby there and not be worried about the smoke too. The room was decorated very nicely!The waiter who attended to us was really excellent! He knew his stuff very well. He explained to us everything we wanted to know about the items in the menu and made some recommendations which turned out to be good. He put us all at ease and even entertained us and chatted with us when he could afford the time.Then the food - lovely! (Look at the photos - sori for the poor quality)For starters, we had the Maguro Tuna Tartare and the Prawns and Avocado salad. The tuna was fresh and delicious. The salad was also fresh and teh prawns juicy and crunchy at the same time.For the mains, I had the paccheri salsiccia - round tube pasta with italian sausages. The pasta was done to my liking. The sausage was good and the sauce wonderful! My wife had the half boston lobster with spaghetti which she enjoyed too. The lobster was pretty good.Finally, for desert, we had the lava cake and the tiramisu. The latter was just like how a good tiramisu should be while the former was... how can i describe it? The lava cake was warm and to eat it with the ice cream was such a wonderful experience!!!And that was what we had - a wonderful experience
5
An unplanned business lunch in town turned into a delightful experience thanks to the warm hospitality, the cosy ambiance and the unique selection of freshly prepared Italian gourmet delights presently available at Capricci's on weekdays at unbeatable rates:$10 nett per person allowed my ten local and overseas guests to sample a scrumptious Italian buffet lunch featuring a wide array of a'-la-minute prepared pastas, pizzas and assorted greens. The food not only tantalised our tastebuds but honestly exceeded our expectations. Service is prompt and genuinely friendly.Unbelievable but true: $10nett Italian buffet lunch on weekdays! Check it out now

I booked Capricci as a surprise for my husband's 30th birthday, when I booked the table I advised them that this was the case and was delighted to see when we arrived that they had saved a really great table and produced a fabulous hand iced dessert at the end saying "happy birthday".We had the Menu Exceptionnel (my husband had the wines too) and could not fault one thing; every morsel of food was perfect and the same for the wines too.The service is second to none with our server adjusting the menu for me (being pregnant) with no qualms at all.The atmosphere, staff, food, wine and whole experience is something that either of us will never forget. We've been lucky enough to dine in several fantastic restaurants but I don't think anything will ever quite match this. If you are looking for somewhere for a special occasion, this is the place
5
We chose Capricci for my Daughter‚Äôs 21st Birthday dinner from Trip Advisor and only after speaking to Max (owner). He was very accommodating in the timing and in catering to young children (2 to 7 years), unlike some more up-market establishments. The restaurant‚Äôs causal ambiance was relaxing and was spacious enough for our entourage (10 adults and 3 young children). Max‚Äôs personal touch in attending to us made us feel very welcomed indeed. Though not on the menu, Max made a simple risotto for the young children who loved it. Having no idea what to order, Max came up with a brilliant idea ‚Äì he would cooked various dishes and continue to serve them till we told him to stop. It took us a long time and only after several dishes before we stopped him. We had Porcini Flan, Carpaccio, Maguro Tuna Tartare, Calamari, Burrata, Lobster Pasta, Risotto Prawns Asparagus, Kurobuta Pork, Rucola Parma Ham Pizza, Chianti, Lamb Chutlets, Tenderloin, Panna Cotta, Tiramisu and Lava Cake. Absolutely delicious ! and that was the unanimous verdict. The best part of all, it was not expensive! I guess for the amount of high quality food we ate, it would‚Äôve cost us perhaps about three or four times what we had to pay if we went to fine dinning restaurant. We are going back, for sure

2MovingTheChi spent four nights in the beautiful city of Singapore. Looking for a nice restaurant using TripAdvisor, we found Capricci, a highly rated Italian restaurant found on Tanjong Pagar Road in the Arab precinct of Singapore.We had been sightseeing all day and decided to treat ourselves to a nice Italian meal. Once we located the restaurant, we loved the open air atmosphere of the bar and restaurant. The owner, Max and our server, Hawafi, were exemplary. We ordered light meals of Spaghetti Bolognese and Prawn and Asparagus Risotto with a carafe of the house Sauvignon Blanc (white wine). For dessert, a wonderful Tiramisu. Bread is served with the meal and the chef offered a complimentary small bowl of delicious tomato soup as a starter.The wine, two meals and dessert totaled $107 SGD.We were very pleased with the service and the flavorful food. It is an easy 10 minute walk from the MRT Tanjong Pagar station on the North-East MRT line. On our last night, we returned for seconds. It is a nice place.Capricci‚Äôs full menu can be found at http://www.capricci.com.sg/italian-food.Make it a special night at Capricci‚Äôs. You will be glad you did.2MovingTheChi.com have been traveling since April, first through the U.S. and currently in southeast Asia

On the strength of the number three Trip Advisor rating I invited a business friend to dinner at this restaurant. His review - JamesBR4723UL on 21st October - is very comprehensive and is an accurate representation of the evening so I shall not go into the same level of detail.However there are two sides to every story and I for that reason I am adding my own review. Firstly the photographs on Capricci's website are perhaps a little flattering. The reality was that inside it was somewhat darker and my particular memory is of a very sparse concrete floor, a somewhat disjointed table layout (perhaps caused by the presence of the large party) with some tables crammed close together and large gaps between other tables. Music was being played which was an unwelcome addition - especially at the volume.My friend's review has conveyed the most disappointing aspects of the visit - most notably the presence of a large and noisy party which most certainly did spoil some of the enjoyment of the experience for the other patrons. As the host of this business dinner I was certainly embarrassed to have my guest unhappy with various aspects as he highlighted.However there were a number of overwhelmingly good things to report:Massimo Aquaro was excellent on the evening. He re-seated us when we asked to be re-seated; he quietened the large group when we objected to their noise levels; he dealt swiftly and generously when the bottle of wine that we had ordered turned out to be the wrong year (a significant detail at the price being asked). He was clearly very passionate about his food and wine and in addition to an excellent recommendation he came across as genuinely apologetic. For these things he deserves real creditThat said nobody goes to a restaurant to have problems which need to be put right by the principal (however good he or she may be). It is for the food, wine and atmosphere that we go and in respect to the first two I would say that the food was excellent, served well and without being too fast or too slow. The wines that we enjoyed were both excellent. Massimo himself was very attentive without being overly so and the waiters were otherwise fine.The atmosphere is a far more difficult thing to review. On the evening that we were there it was clearly not good but it is hard to say how this would be on a night without a large group celebrating a birthday.What started as being a potentially very embarassing evening turned out to be a most enjoyable one because of the food, wine and Massimo's skills.I would therefore conclude by saying that this is not the place to go for anyone that wants super smart or glitzy surroundings. It is perhaps not the right place for a business dinner unless you want something informal. However amongst friends or family I think that this would be an excellent choice and it is on that basis that I would most certainly consider going back to Capricci. I have awarded the restaurant a rating of 4 but if large groups and too much noise were a regular thing it would certainly have to be lowered
5
I had a wonderful time feasting my taste buds with the Degustation Menu of 8 mini dishes with excellent wine pairing for SGD 148. Impeccable service. Friendly and welcoming. I will certainly go again!
5
We went to this place after reading the TripAdvisor reviews. They are all true!!
We had a great time! The food is really good and service impeccable!
I'll definitely go back again for more!!

Not fine dining ambience. We had a spinach appetiser which was very good. The avocado prawn salad was average and so was the tuna main course. Margherita pizza was not so good. Good wine though. Not worth the high rank it has on trip advisor. Looking At the rankings n reviews we went there but there are many other restaurants for Italian better than this like in Robertson quay
4
As mentioned by other reviewers, service was very attentive. They all refer to your name throughout the dinner. The waiters have a cheerful smile.The night we went, it was not busy so we got our food very quickly. The pizza was good, the lobster for my spaghetti was not fresh. The pasta was fresh though. The Milanese veal was good but we were too full to appreciate it.I think the food quality was ok but I would not say it was excellent. It is family type restaurant offering good value. If you are looking for fine dining, this is not the placefor you. for.ou namr throughout dinner

Found by accident and now return every 6 months when there on business. Great food and really nice staff. Owner is Italian and they work hard to serve the real stuff. If you want a private room for 4 ask the wine cellar. My colleagues and I always go there at least once during our brief stay

If you're looking for pretentious "haute cuisine" Italian fare served in tiny portions that leaves you sprinting for the nearest 24 hour prata joint when you've finished your meal, then this probably isn't the place for you. If, however, you want tasty, generous and thoughtfully prepared food then Capricci is absolutely worth going out of your way for.Their menu is comprehensive without being too long - it's clear carefully select dishes they know they can cook well. Main courses are generous but not too much, and the ingredients are fresh and expertly cooked (without trying too hard). If you're a pasta fan go for the pacceri salsiccia.Apart from the great food, the service is fantastic, the waiters are helpful, friendly and unobtrusive. Massimo is a great host (with good taste in music!) and makes you feel like you're being welcomed in as a friend. The decor is simple but tasteful, lends itself to a romantic dinner or a meal with a group of friends.Cannot recommend this place highly enough. Also - it's probably the best value decent restaurant in Singapore. Keep up the excellent work guys

I really like the pizza here, so the pasta. Unique flavor and subtle, true Italian style. Staff service was impeccable. They introduced a very good wine to me, it made me have a great meeting with friends. If I have a chance to come back here, I will visit this restaurant again with my family

When I visit Singapore I prefer local Southeast Asian food, but Capricci is on my "must" list each trip. It was a more formal restaurant in the past, but was converted to a casual atmosphere a couple of years ago. Service has remained excellent and personal. Food quality is top notch. Everything I've tried has been outstanding, from grilled meats, pasta and pizza

Usually eat more local food, but having lived in Italy, like to enjoy Italian on special occasions. The fixed tasting menu with 6 mini servings for S$88 is very good value for foreign food in Singapore, especially downtown. It can be complimented with selected wines for $140, which still represents a good total price.The place is not too ostentatious, but food is first rate in taste and presentation. When we visited it was very quiet so cannot comment on service during peak hours.Because of price compared to quality, the top 3 ranking in Singapore is deserves I think.Complimenti !

We had dinner at Capricci and it was one of my favorite restaurants during my entire trip. We ordered the pasta and pizza, obvious choices. They both were amazing and cooked just how we liked it. The flavors were just spot on and everything was so authentic. The service was great and the staff was very attentive. The wine list was perfect. We dined here twice and it will be my go to place in the future too
5
Outstanding Italian food, prepared by a passionate, attentive Italian, that cares about the food as much as he cares about his customers. A great place to dine, a great place to chill.
5
The guys that run Capricci are great. I loved having a beer and a chat with them. Thoroughly recommend this place.

This is a top 3 restaurant in tripadvisor and my expectations are sky high. When i first entered, i was shocked. About 30-40 people were at the bar and blocking the entrance. When i passed the bar and into the restaurant, i saw a bare bones set-up, simple tables with simpler wooden ugly chairsMy friend ordered a soup and pasta, while i just ordered a steak main. 30mins later, the soup arrived. 60 mins after the soup, our mains arrived. So yes, i waited 90 mins for my main course. I finished my glass of wine way before that, and i was starved senseless. The bread looked awful, and there was no olive oil offered, so i hung onThe milanese tenderloin was good, but it's not worth the wait. Halfway while eating, the owner came to apologise by saying it's not a normal night as the big group outside took up a lot of their resources. It would have been better if i was told before i ordered, rather than after waiting for 90 minsThey offered a complimentary 2nd glass of wine, the waiter was humourous at times, and the owner's apology seemed sincere. But are all these sufficient for me to return, and echo their top 3 placing with another 5 stars? I think no
4
on the night we visited there was a set menu of 3 courses for $55 which was very tasty. I had a spicy chilled soup, spaghetti with crab and deconstructed crumble. Small jug of wine was $25. We sat outside and enjoyed our meal. Good service, friendly staff
5
On our 30 hours stopover in Singapore we visited Capricci restaurant because looking from the outside it seemed to be a comfortable place for a snack. Pizza was recommended so we decided for a rucola parma ham pizza which was really great and not of that greasy texture you get elsewhere. Although we stayed for only half an hour we had a very good time at Capricci restaurant. The staff was so friendly and funny and they really care about their guests!We definitively recommend Capricci restaurant to everyone spending some time in Chinatown
5
Capricci served the best Italian food we had when we were in Singapore. The pasta was to die for. The service was always great and on point. The food was extremely flavorful and authentic. This has to be one of the best places that serve great Italian. The pizza was great, just how I like it. The restaurant serves great variety of drinks. The wine list was excellent and gave good value for money. The breads were fresh and amazing. I would totally recommend this restaurant and you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

Have turned into a regular here because it is worth coming back! The food is original Italian, simple and honest. No frills like it should be. The wines are reasonably priced and the staff are super friendly. The owner is nearly always there and keeps in touch with his clientele. Find out for yourself
5
Capricici stands out and is up there when it comes to authentic Italian food. The service is outstanding, the staff and owner are super friendly !They have nice selection of wines. I had chicken ribbons and it was amazing.I will definitely visit this place again , soon
5
This is a place where you deifnately want to come back to - over and over again. If you like good Italian food, great service and a feeling of being at home - go to Capricci's, Their hospitality, warm atmosphere and generosity makes this a place that I'm always happy to visit. The food is simple, elegant and fantastic tasty, Makes you think you are in Italy's local kitchens. Their $49 dinner menu with great choices is fantastic and hard to beat: 
5
The food at Capricci appears simple, but the flavors have remarkable depth. Capricci's is known best for its tiramisu. This is the classic version of one of the most wonderful combinations of bread and cheese imaginable. You can, of course, vary the cheeses, but the ones I‚Äôve choose are a truly magical combination.The restaurant is both clean and tidy and all the staff members, I call them ‚ÄòThe Bee Gees‚Äô there greeted my companions and me with smiles. I know I'll certainly be returning soon.Congrats Capricci, you are the best

i'm not an Italian, not sure what authentic Italian food should taste like. But the margherita pizza and the breadcrumbs in the salad buffet are my favourtie, yummy!
5
The food here is always excellent, I'd say the best pizza in Asia. However its the welcome and the staff that make Capricci's move from great to excellent.
5
Capricci's is a fantastic place to get a drink or nibbles on any night of the week. The staff are so welcoming and friendly. The first time i went there they asked my name and have failed to forget it over more times i've been in time - what a lovely bunch! Also, the margarita pizza is amazing, a must try
5
If you like good Italian food, great service and a fun time, every time, please consider visiting Capprici's. Their boundless hospitality, generosity and warmth makes this a place that I'm always happy to visit. The food is fantastic, bringing back memories of traveling through Italy's local kitchens. Their $10 lunch special is fantastic and hard to beat: buffet of fresh salad, pizza and pasta. No wonder I eat there almost every day :)In the evening the post-work crowd gives this restaurant a warm and inviting buzz, as patrons overflow onto the sidewalk and patio. Tanjong Pagar is a buzzing street so there's always great people watching, too
5
It's rare in Singapore you get service as friendly as this. The owner (Massimo) is a true gentleman and always takes time to ask you how you are and actually listens. The bartenders Alvin and Mahaffi (excuse the spelling) know exactly what I want before i even know! The food is fantastic and well priced - Including $10 all you can eat lunch. This is a great bar and restaurant and I will continue going here
5
I was many time in singapore for work and finally I found the real italian restaurant, with a real italian owner real italian food and real italian atmosphere . The wine list is superb, the service is excellent and the friendly owner help me to choose the right food, i was particularly lucky because that night was on saturday after dinner a party go in on so after the dinner the music was at the same level. Fantastic experience big big up
5
Capricci is one of my all time favourite restaurants in Singapore. Authentic Italian flavours across an amazing original menu, complimented with a great choice of well priced wines. The Hosts (Massimo) is the perfect host where nothing is too much trouble and special meals are made without hesitation. You will never leave disappointed or feeling like you did not get value for money
5
Not stopping at Capricci in Singapore is a missed opportunity for outstanding food and service. Everyone feels welcomed, comfortable in this very special restaurant. The menu has such outstanding, perfectly cooked meals that before you leave you plan another time there. Fresh lobster last night was absolutely beyond my expectations. I have been very impressed with the pistachio crusted lamb chop. All starters, antipasti, trigger your desire for the next courses. It's far from 'just a pasta place'. Remember to save room for a dessert! The bar is fully stocked and after your meal take time for a Grappa or Lemoncello. Plan ahead for the cozy, private dinning table in a wine cellar setting. Arrive for your special dinner or stop in for drinks and snacks later in the evening. After morning shopping take a break for lunch. Conveniently located
5
We just arrived in Singapore and we never felt so at home like in Capricci!The atmosfere is great,all the staff is extremely friendly and welcoming, there is a good selection of wines, and the food a REAL Italian experience!You must try the Massimo' focaccia!Vito from Ital
5
My friend brought me to this place and i was in love with the AGLIO AGLIO it simply melted in my mouth and i love the people as they made the dining and drinking with friends so fun and relaxed. I will definitely visit this place again, they have such great customer service and wonderful mannerism and they take pride in the service and set-up. They actually customised some food for you and make you feel so special. I truly enjoyed this place it was a delight and i have recommended to my colleagues and friends for a nice night with wine and dine this is a must go to at least once in their lives.....i rate them with 5stars and beyond =
5
One of the best Italian restaurants I have been to in my life! The food was awesome especially the Quatro Formaggi! Love the ambience as well; will definitely be back!! Must try for all Italian food lovers out there!
5
the food is excellent, high quality ingredients, great cooking skills, and generous portion.
The atmosphere it feels to be at in one of those typical restaurant back home (italy). Nothing pretentious or unreasonably sophisticated, just authentic!
5
I recently spent a week in sg, and found¬†Capricci a great place to go for dinner and drinks at the end of the working day. Everyone is extremly friendly and I met so many great peaple. Grazie tanto!
4
food, decor, service....all satisfied. to start with, warm bread with olive oil/vinegar was served (can't stop)...then comp tomato soup was served as well. thanx for the surprise. we ordered burrata parma ham & spinach souffle as starters. burratta cheese was fresh, perfectly matched with salty parma ham. spinach souffle was also very delicious but texture is more to pudding rather than souffle. quatro formaggi was beautiful as well. unfortunately could not reach dessert. thank you for the wonderful time
5
Top notch hospitality by the host Massimo and his wife ...was greeted by the bartender upon entry and it hits off right from there !Excellent food ...not oily ..variety of drinks to choose from ...wine..beer ...non-alcoholic .. The best part of it all ..u can ask ur dishes to be served without alcohol/pork content in it for the muslim guests. =))Would love to dropby on any other day again !Thanks guysss

Once you walk through the restaurant you realize there is a whole dining section set back from the front on the street section, hidden from the passer bys. It's more refined out back - but not stuffy at all, very relaxed and inviting for a casual meal or a special get together. There are also communal tables for groups. The service is full of smiles and friendly Italian pride. The menu is diverse and has all the standard to a degree bu with an individual touch. The pizza kitchen is open so you can see what's going on at all time. House pours are of high quality. The price average and good value. well worth a casual visit to get your taste buds on the right track when it comes to Italian taste as a reasonable price

I have eaten at this restaurant about 1 1/2 years ago and wanted to repeat this nice experience with my wife this time. The start was great - typical Italian reception by the head-waiter, very good tomato-soup as amuse bouche, and the appetizer were fantastic. First main course plus the suggested wine to go with was still very good, but due to an increasing amount of guests, the staff started to be a bit stressed. The second main course was poor, to say the least. Instead of a proposed monk-fish, they served a cod-fish which was cold already and the lamb was old and more than well done. The staff by that time ran around and tried to cope with the - by that time - full restaurant. It was noisy and chaotic. The final cheese platter took very long and the bites were extremely tiny. By that time we were just longing to leave this place.A pity, the restaurant really was a gem and I hope the owner and the chef have ambitions to get back to their initial level
5
First we passed the place as it appeared more like a bar. But as we entered the place we discovered a top quality Italien restaurant. Great food and a very good wine list. (Try the Wine of the house. a Merlot from Italy ! excellent!) Friendly service from the staff. Even the music fulfilled our meal. We had the lamb with pistacio and the chicken ribbons, and the rewarded tiramisu, A lovely meal. If ever in Singapore again, we will be back

My first dining experience at Capricci was a combination of great company, delicious food and the right ambiance. We started off with tuna tartare and spinach souffle. Both were great, but the spinach souffle was definitely my favourite between the two! These appetizers were flavourful without being overpowering. No visit to an Italian spot should end without some quintessential dishes like pizza and pasta. And even though I'm not usually a huge cheese lover, I found myself thoroughly enjoying the four-cheese pizza.The laid-back and chill atmosphere is suitable for romantic dates or small gatherings :) For authentic Italian food, I'd definitely recommend Capricci. Two thumbs up
5
One of my favourite bars / restaurants in Singapore. In terms of personal service, Massimo and the team have perfected it - it's rare to get such warm and attentive service in Singapore, especially at this kind of price point.Food is great, especially the pizzas. They also do a great lunch deal with a good selection of food for $15++, very good value for CBD!Drink selection is excellent with a strong selection of beers, wines, spirits, and cocktails. Mahaffi the barman makes a great mojito!Highly recommended and myself and friends will continue to be regular visitors
5
The food is fabulous is good.. Try the lava cake and Pana Cotta... Price is reasonable.. Buffet lunch buffet is good and they serve good coffee.. Worth a 2nd visit!
5
Massimo and his team never fail to make you feel welcome. The food is proper Italian (with authentic Swiss Raclette just to mix things up), the wines are great and we always end up staying much longer than we probably should.
5
Excellent food, superb service and wonderful atmosphere!!! The whole night was spot on, a large tabled catered for with personalized service.
4
It was the first time my colleagues and I patronize Capricci, and we were so blown away by the amazing ambiance. The customer service at Capricci is top notch, and food quality is no doubt excellent! Our favorite dish of the evening is definitely the moist and tender "Veal Scallopini al Marsala with mashed potatoes". And the second most popular dish will definitely be the refreshing and zesty "Orange perfumed Marguro tuna tartare with avocado!" Both are a must try for your first visits at Capricci.So thank you Capricci for creating such a beautiful evening that was memorable for my team and I!-Kimberly

Having recently moved to Singapore, Capricci has very quickly become one of my regulars. The food is fantastic (the risotto to die for) and authentic, the atmosphere welcoming and comfortable. What truly sets apart Capricci though is their service - I have yet to find an equal in Singapore, in the hospitality that has been extended to me, my partner and friends that is as friendly and welcoming. If you're in the neighbourhood and you're looking for dinner, a post-work drink or a lunch, I can but only thoroughly recommend Capricci
4
I really like their lunch buffet deal. You can eat all the pasta, pizzas, soup, and 2 other dishes at the price of SGD15++. At the same time, their pasta is really nice and pizza is made right in front of us. Food is always hot - despite the buffet style and food is always replenished (some times with different dishes!). One of the better Italian restaurant that I have been to in Singapore with a very affordable price range
4
It was my first time to such a place, bringing my husband along, since he loves to eat western food. And I was glad to have chosen Capricci for our dining location. Foods served were good. Ambiance was remarkable. Staff were all very polite and approachable. I was offered an alternative to 1 of the food listed in the menu, since I cannot eat pork or anything related to it. But the best of all was the steak & tiramisu. For somehow who rarely eats take, my husband was enjoying the small cut cake served to him. If we were not that full, we would have ordered another set of the cake alone. All and All, it was a great experience dining at Capricci. Keep up the good service guys!!! Thumb's Up
5
Its difficult to find good quality European food in Singapore but this place is amazing. We had a Pizza Prosciutto and a Mushroom Risotto as a starter to share. The Risotto was super soft and tasted amazing. As I main we ordered the Porterhouse steak and were very pleased with how it was grilled. We had some nice red wine that of course cost a fortune but that's just Singapore.Overall very pleased with everthing in this Restaurant
5
very nice and authentic Italian restaurant! The food is perfect, you might think you are in Italy! The owners and their team are very friendly and let you feel "at home"! We were even there with our three kids and they treated them like princesses and prince, not o be taken for granted in a restaurant in this price range! We will be back again for sure! Thanks to the food, the wine, the atmosphere and the staff

We went here for a quick drink and ended up staying all evening. We were warmly greeted by Mahafi who was friendly and great with suggestions of drinks we might like, so we took him up on all of his suggestions - and had an excellent pizza as a bar snack. Our son and his girlfriend subsequently returned later in the week for a meal and were really impressed with the food
