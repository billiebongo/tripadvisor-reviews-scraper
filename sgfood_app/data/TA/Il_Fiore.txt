Came here again, this time for dinner. Really love the luncheon meat fries here. The Luncheon meat fried rice and fried chichen are pretty good too.

Had lunch here. The food is good and the price is reasonable. A good place to chill and have lunch. It serves dinner too but the place is also a drinking place for office workers at night.

Had an excellent steak here. The other food we ate was also amazing. Will return in future visits to Singapore. Highly recommended for food and drinks. Great drink selection also.

If you demand the best service at a friendly and socially liberal place to relax with your friends and colleagues, you must go there!

Il Fiore located at 50 Raffles Place Singapore Land Tower most people, do not know this place exist. It is hidden in the basement. The place gets crowded yet cosy ambience. The food that we ordered was good, I must say it’s one of the few places that has mastered both the Western and Local cuisine. The price is a bit on the high side. Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect hide away. Would highly recommend. It’s absolutely a place one should venture

Most people, including people working at Singapore Land Tower, do not know this place exist. It is hidden in the basement accessible only via a staircase by the side near the carpark ramp, behind the Battery Road taxi stand.You come here for various reasons. Because it is raining and you don't want to walk anywhere and get wet. Because you heard the local food is good, although they are priced like Italian food. Or maybe just because you heard about the semi nude photo of the boss Angie, which hangs in one corner of the restaurant, near the cashier.The food is good, but the price is a bit on the high side. On our last visit, we ordered the $13.95 Signature Seafood Bee Hoon and upgraded it to sharing size for three at $18.50. We also ordered the $17.95 IL Fiore Pizza. The Bee Hoon was good but expensive and looked like it is only slightly bigger than one person's meal. The pizza was nice. The place is crowded yet cozy. Definitely a place one should try.Heard that Angie can remember every one of her regular customers. I am not that regular, so I cannot confirm this fact

Working in Raffles Place, II Fiore is my go to place for Colleagues, Clients, and Friends. Never Been let down. Service is always top class as well as the food. One of the few places that has mastered bot the Western and Local sides of their menu. It also doesn't matter what the situation. As mentioned have had formal lunches here as well as the odd liquid lunch with friends and each time its always been ideal.

This place knows how to look after it's customers, if you are a regular they remember your drink and it's normally ready by the time you reach the bar, they always make sure you have a drink in your hand so it's very easy to get out of control.

If it were possible, I would give Il Fiore 3.5 stars out of 5. This place is practically a Raffles Place institution having operated from the same basement location at Singapore Land Tower for close to 2 decades. Think of it as a favourite aunt or uncle who never really saw the need to move on from the early 90s. As a place to grab drinks after work, I have heard its incredibly popular and has a loyal fan base. As a restaurant during the business day, it offers both an Italian and local food menu and attracts a healthy mix of locals and expats. The food in my view is prepared and presented as it would have been in the 90s. Some of the perennial favourites with the local crowd are:1. bee hoon (wok fried thin rice vermicelli noodles with seafood or beef);2. hor fun (wok fried flat rice vermicelli noodles with seafood or beef served with an eggy gravy);3. spam fries (deep fried spam cut and served like French fries).The pastas look popular too though I have yet to try any of the Italian offerings.The set up has an old fashioned tavern like feel and the noise level can make conversation a little difficult when the restaurant is at capacity. Service is usually efficient if not a little harried - you can tell the servers are really trying to stay on top of things. Without fuss or prompting, we were given a 10% discount off our bill today as one of our main courses took much longer to get to the table. A rare gesture these days in Singapore - it is evidence that they still value their customers and want you to come back.A few tables have been set up in the non air-conditioned stairwell leading to the restaurant entrance for smokers and diners without reservations at peak times. It's not for nothing that Il Fiore is also fondly referred to as the dungeon by some regulars!

On a short visit to Spore, had lunch here with my friend. Had seafood Bee Hom (don't know whether I got the name right) which is a local delight made of vermicelli noodles. The dish was delicious to say the least; and is definitely highly recommended. The place made the whole experience memorable and desiring for more. Its relatively small place with full of people enjoying their lunch and the less fortunate ones waiting their turn. Advance booking is definitely recommended if you don't want to wait. The place was buzzing with life and the staff were very nice.
