Omakase dinner was awesome ! Good food, lovely ambience and attentive service.
Address at the website needs to be updated though. Itâ€™s on level 1 and not level 2

This is by far the best Japanese food I tasted in singapore. It's very expensive but it's worth every single penny. Fish is fresh, staff is friendly and the menu taste so good

Many years ago this was my favourite spot for a special Japanese set lunch. I stopped going when they changed their policy and lunch was 2 seatings - as I found that when I am spending a lot of money on a set lunch it is usually for an occasion, which I may want to enjoy in over 80 minutes (your time allocation). However, recently friends took me there for lunch and all my previous feelings were reaffirmed! Set lunch is not cheap, then they still charge you for your tea and appetizer and of course everything is ++. The meal pacing is all about their time schedule and not at all about the customers' experience - so very NOT Japanese. After 70 minutes we were basically told to leave as they needed the table - although the restaurant was mostly empty. Confirmed, I will not return. There are much better (and cheaper!) places to go for a great set lunch

Went to try the Omakase lunch after hearing rave reviews by diehard fans.Service by the general service staff was average with no real attempt to be warm. More functional. But that was fine by me.But the almost zero effort of the counter chefs to interact was the surprise.Almost 3/4 through before even an indication of the sushi being served. Before that was just place and silence.But the staff were chatty and friendly only to those I would think are regulars and focused on their efforts there.I read a previous review of washing of the towel and would also attest to that.Halfway through, the lead chef also whipped out his phone to show something on it, which to me was a no-no.Food was average. It was filling but did not make the grade in the sashimi and most of the sushi.Highlights were the beef sushi, smoked fish sushi and the 3 sampler desserts.overall, guess you need to be a regular or die hard to rave about it
2
This is the first time I stepped into a restaurant and felt that I owe the chef money. There's no smile or greeting. The staff is not proactive, they don't offer you sake unless you ask for it although we bought sake from them. If anyone of you loves sake here, pls bring your own. 40 for 720ml and 100 for 1.8l. Their sake runs out very fast from my experience there and the only few btls left are their high end stuff.Don't expect the kind of service as you would from a sushi ya in sg. They are not at that level yet. Staff don't seem to be experienced and I have seen the chef squeeze dry his towel and water actually dropped into the sashimi plate he was preparing next to a basin. Well done chef!Overall food is ok but service is not. You can expect 2-4 sushi on your plates at any one time if you don't consume it immediately. Some of us are ok abt it but I am not. It's like they are rushing you to finish the food and get one with it.
2
For all the hype, the experience was...disappointing. Service staff were inexperienced, food was not up to the expectations one would have given the reputation and the price. Bones were present in a sardine sashimi, and when asked about this, the assistant to the chef brushed it off as normal and they had done their best to minimise bones, even though my point was that they should have forewarned us. Not rock-bottom as far as experience is concerned: sushi and dessert were nice, but not a place I would return to. And I would not recommend my friends eithe

It has been more than ten years and Aoki remains one of the best Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Very impressed with the service and the delicious food to match. Miso soup tastes a bit strong but that could be my personal preference. The price is not cheap either. A lunch for two is at least $100 in total.
3
Someone said that Aoki san "never smile". That not true, he smile, but very selectively. He also "charge" for it. Perhaps nowhere else (at least in Singapore) you can see in Japanese restaurant 5$ charges for hot tea (hojicha) and wet towel (complimentary items for lunch set).Restaurant manager trying his best to please customers (and doing it very well), however it is up to the restaurant "head" were to "look on".Recent renovation (which is very nicely done) looks like a very significant investment in that small biz. We may only guess was that a reason of price increase and unusual charges.If you prepared for high level cooking and very formal style of serving reflected in eyes-dropping bill, then place is right for you

We booked counter table for three from 12:30 to 1:30pm, we told them we won't be able to arrive at noon but 12:30pm and no problem to leave @ 1:30pm.They started to call us around 12:20pm, when we were on the way and they told us no table for us when we arrived at 12:30pm. Even though they agreed to have us from 12:30pm on the phone in the morning, they told us no table for us, because we didn't arrive at noon and didn't answer their call.They asked us to wait until 1pm or start to have sushi lunch at their Shabu Shabu restaurant Shabu Gen where is two doors next. We asked them to reserve the sushi counter table, they should not make us sit at different restaurant and deliver sushi from two doors next.They never gave us apology, I was so shocked about their attitude, especially about Japanese chef, because he never wanted to admit their mistake.He knows me and my family, we say Hi each other if we saw each other even other places, even at other and not their restaurant.I'm Japanese and using them, introducing them to our friends for seven years now.I hate to say but they are forgetting the most important Japanese customer service Omotenashi completely. I hate the restaurant became very arrogant because they are popular and still very rare because they are not in Japan

Returned for lunch again after the restaurant's renovations. Food is again superb and not to be faulted. Service levels improved since last visit with waitresses attending to requests almost immediately. Should not look at the prices if you are looking for one of the top-notch Japanese eateries in Singapore. Superb, magnificent and satisfied
5
The food is excellent and they have great variety of sake to match. This is a upscale restaurant but reasonably priced for the quality .
5
The truffle beef bowl is so juicy and tasty. Highly recommended! However, the price is a bit high.
For the lunch set, is so so. Its good but not so special. But the truffle beef bowl is to die for!
3
Typical Japanese ambience. Small and warm.
Service is good.
Seafood are imported 2 times from Japan every week.
Prices are a little high as compared to same standard restaurant in Japan.

Newly refurbished Aoki is definitely high-end experience of Japanese culinary prowess, at reasonable prices when going for a menu item one would typically have for lunch ( sushi plate with starters, Miso soup, dessert).Setting is refined, chefs very active at the sushi bar, and excellent service. Booking is a must

This restaurant is by the side road before turning into the car park of Shaw center. Basically it's opposite HSBC.We went for dinner . Nice and cool place with attentive staffs and great decor.It's not a big restaurant , but it's cozy.Sashimi range are fresh and nice , one of the good Japanese restaurant we have visited.We did not choose the set menu but instead ala carte and in the end, the bill was about US$600 for 3 of us. Abit overpriced on the wagyu beef but all good if you are enjoying the sashimi freshness 
4
Aoki has a nice ambiance with private rooms, booth tables and a sushi bar. Service is good. The food selection is very wide for a high end Japanese restaurant and you can get anything from grilled wagyu beef to sushi to tempura. The variety is nice for diners who like to mix and match Japanese dishes rather than go for a pure sushi experience. Quality and execution of the food is consistent and competent but never at an outstanding level. Lunch offers good value
4
Aoki has been long enough to establish itself as one of the fine Japanese dinning restaurants in Singapore despite there have been an array of new ultra premium Japanese restaurants from Japan that opened in town recently.Quality of ingredients have remained of high standards and remained true to its traditional sense. We enjoyed the privacy of the private dinning room.It continued to give dinner the comfort that one would come out the restaurant with a delicious meal
4
The place is located inside the Shaw Center in city center. You can reach here to get authentic Japanese food. There are a variety of soups, noodles ( soft, medium, hard) and other japanese dishes to select from. The salads and small bites are also very tasty. The lotus stem crackers were just very good. The ambiance is very much Japanese, with waitresses from local areas.

Is a small restaurant, advice to make reservation in advance to avoid disappointment. They have sushi bar counter seating and booth / table seating. Seating at sushi bar counter may feel abit stress if you are not use to it, 1 of the sushi chef always don't smile (unless you know him well)Food: 3.8/5Nigri Sushi Jyo-sen ($33) : salad, 7 types of nigri sushi + 1 hand roll, miso soup and dessert + teaNigri Sushi Tokusen ($55) : salad, chawan mushi, 9 types of premium nigri sushi + 1 hand roll, miso soup and dessert + teaService: 4/5Ambience: 4.2/

We ordered the 9 piece sushi set and a bowl of truffle beef (kagoshima). The sushi is similar to what you would get at Daiwa sushi or the like at Tsujiki. However, pricewise it is still cheaper at Daiwa sushi and type of sushi is far better then Aoki. The miso soup at Aoki is normal - similar to what you would get in any restaurant unlike Daiwa. The beef truffle is something unique.I ordered it because I got a weakness for truffles. it is very good albeit a bit expensive. $110 for 70g beef and it came in a small bowl. Note that the beef is not on the set lunch menu. What came out memorable is the dessert. One of the best compared to other restaurants. You should order the ice-cream dessert from the ala-carte menu. worth the $6. All in all, frankly, I don't know what the hype is about Aoki. All I can say is that it serves good quality sushi. Set lunch is ok if you have money to splurge. Overall i paid about$200 for lunch for two person. I doubt if I will return to Aoki anytime soon, I would rather pay what i paid in JPN for better variety of sushi set. As for the beef, better pay a bit more for a fine dinning at Hacchi, this one is super

A quaint little Japanese restaurant hidden away from the crowds of Orchard Road. It has a cute, traditional private room, counter seats and also a number of table seats. One of the best chirashi dons in Singapore! Desserts are outstanding too.
4
The sushi value is good and the signature beef rice is very average.
On a price value point of view, seems pretty ok. But probably won't go again.
1
Very bad restaurant. The cook very bad with no sense and understanding of classic japan cousin. Some dishes are very salty, some were fried with bad oil. Probably everything with wrong taste.
Do no waste your time to go there.
Ivan.

Brought my family here for Omakase lunch for a birthday celebration. I must say the food was excellent quality and well presented. Would have rated 5stars... but at first the dishes were just placed in front of us without the waiters or manager introducing or describing the food? I would think it would be the norm... As I was interested to know what each dish was I made a point to ask the waiter what each dish was... following which they started introducing the rest of the dishes. That would be the only Low point... Otherwise it was a enjoyable lunch and the setting was quiet and cosy for four persons
4
I attended a business lunch one day and we are in the small private room in the back area. The service was very efficient and the food was very good quality. It was reasonably priced compared to many Japanese restaurants given the quality of the food. A number of Japanese guests ate at the restaurant which shows it must be good
5
As good as Tokyo. Not cheap but worth it. I mean it's Singapore so why would it be cheap? Truly exceptional service and food. I did the a la Carter but ended up ordering a lot of the omekase items because they looked so ridiculously good. And they were 
3
The food is without doubt, Good! The sushi was fresh. The rice well cooked. The sashimi delectable. Everything in the sets we ordered "omakase" (chef's recommendation) at $115++ and "nigiri tokusen" (special sushi set) at $55+, uni appetizer and flat fish tempura $20++ each was Good! But the service was really a downer. For such a fine establishment which charged premium rates, one would expect premium food AND service. To celebrate my birthday, my friend gave me a treat. We booked the private room. It wasn't very conducive. We could hear people talking, traffic sounds, buses honking , passerbys everything... The room was just in the front outside the restaurant, beside the main door. Strange location. The staff was attentive. But not well trained, it seems. Plus, he tried but he wasn't the best choice of frontline service staff. We couldn't understand what he said or was trying to introduce. It's not his fault but the establishments'. We didn't know what was being served up half the time because we couldnt understand what he said. At one point, Nigiri Tokusen sounded like "Legally Toxin". You can imagine our shock! The worst thing was, we were RUSHED through our meal. There is 2 rounds for lunch but We were NOT informed during reservation or after we sat down or after / during ordering. We thought we could enjoy our luxurious long lunch in peace. We even set aside time until 2pm for lunch. But we were literally CHASED off by 130pm!! Shocking! We felt it strange when our dishes were brought out one by one very quickly. At one point our table was so full as if we ordered ZeChar! I thought we were having Japanese fine dining?! Then suddenly they brought the bill. We wondered, is it that we were sitting in the private room, they thought we would eat & run off without paying? And quickly the dessert appeared. When they saw we haven't started eating it, (we were still eating sushi when dessert was shoved in our faces), the staff came in to say, the 2nd round has been waiting awhile already, can we hurry?? WHAT?? We pay $200++ for a lunch and get chased out... Terrible. It's such a downer and disappointment. The food is good but I find no justification to return. It's not the only place that serves good Japanese food anyway... Average rating because - good food plus poor service. Won't be back anytime soon.

My first visit to Aoki was an enjoyable one. The private room where we were seated was a little stuffy, and the servers took a while to get to us due to the supposedly faulty service-call button. Those disappointments aside, we had Chirashi Don set for lunch, which was reasonably priced and came with an assortment of sashimi, sliced into cubes, and decadent Tamago to boot! The hot green tea was also fantastic, though no mention that the appetiser, green tea, and subsequent dessert will be separately charged, though we already knew that from reading online reviews prior to eating. For the price level, the meal was well worth it, recommended for their value set lunches
4
Came here for lunch today and opted for the chirashi. This was served with a few small starters, a miso soup and some dessert. The quality of the fish was really pretty good although I generally prefer the pieces to be slightly larger (makes it more challenging to eat with chopsticks). Very good value at lunchtime.
4
My best friend frequents Aoki often and she took me to this restaurant for lunch as I had requested for Japanese food. I was satisfied enough with the service and food that was plated very nicely; she informed me that usually the food plating is even better and she was actually a bit disappointed for me as she felt that the experience was usually better than what we had that day
3
Went there for lunch with friend. Food was alright, nothing remarkable. Service is meh. What made me really uncomfortable was the chefs were obviously trying to listen to our conversations when we were talking ( we were sitting at the sushi bar) Very unprofessional.
4
Must eat their Wagyu truffle beef bowl! Sometimes I can't find this in the menu but you can ask the waiter for it and they will tell you they have and the price.
The sushi is average for the price they charge though.
5
I dont want to introduce this place because its already famous and hard to reserve a place.
They offer simply best japanese lunch. But dinner is rather expensive.
4
Our favorite Japanese lunch place, Great value!
We like the Chirashi set and the sushi. Classy and 'Japanese' ambiance.
We also like to seat inside one of the private room.
Never fails!

Very mediocre food, awful service and seriously the most snobby place in the world! We have enjoyed sushi all over the world and this has to be the worst experience we have ever had. The would not answer any of our questions about the food and when we dared to ask the price of their specials they actually laughed at us. They charged extra for the small appitzer that they automatically bring to the table. The beer came in a very small little 10oz glass and to say the most about the least, it was an awful dining experience.That being said, we would not return even if it was free due to the rude service and snobby waitress.With so many wonderful places in Singapore, it would be the LAST place I would ever recommend. Seriously, Singapore is one of the finest cities in the world for dining and sadly we spent one of our evenings here. Luckily, we asked for the check and went elsewhere which was a smart call. If the company wasn't so great, it would have been a total loss.Avoid at all costs

We reserved a table for Saturday lunch at 12noon at Aoki.Ordered the Mazechirashi ($40) - "Sushi rice topped with mixed Sashimi served with salad, Miso soup, pickles and dessert".The bowl served was generously topped with Sashimi (80% with 20% rice).Service was good. Overall, a good dining experience
4
The first time we came here, we remembered that we had one of the most innovative menus ever. This time round, the menu does seem expensive. Junior omaksae is $180. After that the omakase just gets more expensive sushi and sahimi >$300 and >$400 if it includes cooked items. The seasonal menu had no prices attached. We decided to eat the junior omakase menu. It was great. Appetizers were innovative. Decent amounts of fresh sushi and sashimi. Loads of food - I don't think we could eat more. Happiness. We were very happy to be in the booth because it was very private and a lot more noisy downstairs. Nice place to come for a special event
4
This restaurant came highly recommended by a Japanese colleague, and the food was lovely but not mind blowing. I prefer both Waku Gin and Shinji, but if you are looking to eat traditional Japanese food such as sashimi and sushi it will not let you down
4
Food is great but you have to know where are other restaurants serving up the same level of quality food and not even charging as much. Don't really understand the size of the dishes here we kept ordering more because they came out smaller than expected
5
i thought the staff were very nice , kind and attentive. The food was outstanding and truly some of the best quality sushi I have had ever.Our lunch set was between $35 and $55.00 and I think it was worth every cent.You can go nuts and spend whatever you like but I think the sushi 7 or 9 piece set was well worth it.The fish was of outstanding quality.If you want excellent sushi or sashimi go here in Singapore
5
Good quality and fresh ingredients used in all the dishes served. The chef is very experienced, and probably one of the best in Singapore. By Les Amis Group.
5
It's been many years since I've been here and I must say it's good to be backFor dinner, they have omakase and a la carte. The former ranges from $180 to $500. Even if you're hungry, the $180 is enough and takes 2.5 hours to complete My menu had everything from fatty tuna and uni sashimi to mountain yam to delicious soupService is great tooThe only slight comment was that when I asked if there was uni on the menu, the head waiter said no so I ordered uni sushi a la carte. But it turned out there were 2 uni items on the menu. And that the Japanese head chef looks too gruff and unfriendly Top 3 in Singapore together with Shinji and Hashid
2
The food is good as described in other reviews. I consider myself a connoisseur of Japanese food and am always on the look out for good Japanese restaursnt. Aoki lives up to the expectation in terms of the quality it delivers. Chawanmushi is certainly the best we've had. However, you expect to have a fully satisfying meal at 150$ per head. We had two thimbleful of sake each and left hungry. The food though good is nothing outstanding. It is what you would expect from a good Japanese restaurant. There are others of the same quality in Singapire that serve exquisite fate for 40% less and certainly You wouldn't be left hungry. I have no objection to spending on food but As for the service ... They are obviously used to big Spendibg diners and don't hesitate to indicate that to you non-verbally. I know this restaurant is well reviewed and this why we chose it. It did not live up to expectation and it is certainly not worth shelling out this amount of money
5
One of my best beef bowl is served here! Superb taste, great atmosphere, friendly waiter. In case you have plan to visit this place, please kindly call them and ask for a reservation. One of the must order item is the Wagyu beef bowl serve with egg and Black/White truffle! This is the bomb! And you'll be surprised with the bills too. But, it is all worth it
1
I have not had such terrible service at reservation stage. Aoki really set a new low.I made a reservation a few days ago and on the dining day, I had a missed call and sms from Aoki at 233pm and 235pm respectively. The text of the sms is as follows, "Good evening ,please call us back to reconfirm your reservation for today dinner before 3pm,if there no confirmation from you, we will take as cancel.Thank you very much. Aoki restaurant 63338015"They basically gave me less than 30 min to call back to confirm the reservation or else they will cancel my reservation. Such arrogance and attitude. I have kept the sms as evidence.I called back before 3pm but no one picked up their phone. If they think they can treat their customers in such a shabby fashion, I am not going back to a restaurant with such terrible service. If they think customers are unimportant, then perhaps we all should be visiting their competitors instead of them

Okay, this place is not cheap. It is also quite hard to find. The sign outside is only in Japanese and is on a small doorway. The windows are frosted glass so you can't see inside. I found it after a bit of hunting around. I didn't book. I managed to get a seat at the sushi counter and ordered the Omakase. It was some of the best sushi I have eaten outside of Japan. I also loved watching the chefs at work. The sushi is prepared one or two pieces at a time. Do not come here if you are in a hurry. It is a place to relax, savour the food and wait for your second mortgage approval to come through so you can pay the bill. Highly recommended for sushi and sashimi lovers

I have been reading rave reviews about this highly rated Japanese restaurant by the Les Amis group so was excited to dine here for the first time last week. It is well known that dining at this restaurant is not cheap so I came prepared.I was here for lunch and the restaurant was fully booked/seated by 1pm. As my friend is a regular diner here, we got a semi private-style table with retractable sliding screen.There are 2 menus available - the normal one and a seasonal one. You have to ask for the seasonal menu as it is not given by default. The lunch bento sets on the normal menu are not expensive.However, this restaurant is most famous for its grilled Wagyu beef pieces served on a bed of sushi rice topped with an onsen egg (soft poached egg) and shaved white truffles! All the truffle-based dishes are in the seasonal menu. I am not sure if white truffles (seasonal) are used all year round with this dish or they substitute it with black truffles when the white Alba ones are out of season. It is a VERY expensive dish but worth every penny. It comes in a choice of 3 servings (differentiated by the weight of the Wagyu beef). I opted for the medium sized serving which was SGD130. I asked for a medium cooked beef and they just melted in my mouth! The whole bowl was just oozing with the amazing smell of the white truffles. Hands down, best beef don ever tasted!Apart from that, the chawan mushi (steamed egg custard) with shaved white truffles are also very delicious. Very smooth and silky.Another star dish that my friend ordered was the negitoro (chopped toro with Japanese spring onions), ikura (salmon roe that pops in your mouth) and uni (sea urchin) don. I think this dish is a special dish that is not in either menu. You have to specify this to the waiter. It was not cheap as well i.e. SGD90.Overall, this was a once in a lifetime experience and certainly worth dining for a special occasion. Very very expensive
4
I was seating in the bar, made the reservation the same day (it seems I was lucky because it was completely full). Very good food; excellent quality, great "sushi cutting techniques" and good kitchen. I was not happy with the price for two reasons; 1) When you order omakase you expect the chef to be innovative and surprising in the selection of dishes, which it was not. 2) the chefs and cooks at the bar were chatting and laughing loudly at a couple seating also in the bar, which I don't think is the kind of ambiance you expect from a SD 250+ dinner. The food was worth it, they deserve another chance to get 5 dots
3
We ordered gustation for each of us. The first course "salad" is little too saucy and too salty, we did not like it. Followed by the rest, it was ok however, the sashimi is the best! To me, the restaurant seems claustrophobic. Service staff were trying their best not to come in our way, we were placed at the end corner of the counter, their hands keep coming in between our conversation, when serving. I thought that's quite irritating
5
The Aoki is a very authentic Japanese Restaurant. There are different small spaces to dine at - so you have the feeling you eat alone with your friends. The quality they serve is extremly high. The Sushi are over the Top!!! If you love Japan kitchen: A MUST G
2
Exorbitant charges and lousy service. Paid more than S$200 per head for a meal with extremely lousy service. Had to asked for tea a few times.
2
Over priced and food was average. Just like the other Les Amis restaurants I have visited. Not worth a visit.
Service was so so and sometimes arrogant.
Basically they just took average food and present them nicely and then over charge you for it.
4
This is a place which serves quality food and very fresh sashimi, however, the entire dinner affair was a very rushed event as though they were doing a second round of dinner reservations. Mind you this was a Thurs evening that we were talking about and the entire restaurant was not fully booked.Will likely not come back for dinner with the kind of money that you are paying and there are definitely better choices out there
5
Went to this place last weekend at the Shaw Centre on recommendation of a friend who visited before. Not going there for service per se, the food there is simply one of the best in Singapore, if not around the region. The raw fish dishes are well presented, fresh and yes, they charge expensive, but if you don't book, chances are that you cannot get a spot there.Would definitely return
4
There are many Japanese Sushi places in Singapore and Aoki's Sushi Counter provides one of the better quality of Sushi. They do also have tables and private rooms, however, services there are less than the counter. If you want to enjoy the visit, you want to sit at Sushi Counter, and order Omakase, which can be expensive. Overall atmosphere is good, and the execution of overall services can be enhanced
5
One of my favorite hang out place in Singapore and last visit was in April when girlfriend was in town.Located in the heart of the shopping district, it is yet seems to be separated from the rest of area, as it is located behind the Isetan and Shaw Tower. Like the usual Japanese restaurant, this compact premise could only accommodate not more than 30 persons in lunch and booking in advanced in highly recommended.My favorite dish is always the white fish sashimi with truffle oil and truffle, and the Toyama shiroebi with uni. Both are must try if available
1
We went to Aoki for lunch expecting something nice. It is, after all, a sister restaurant to the old and esteemed Les Amis. Alas, what we found is below average food and indifferent (if I am generous) service. The chefs are Japanese, which usually bodes well. But their glum faces should have been a warning of the experience we were about to have. I ordered a nigiri sushi set and was horrified to see them pull out a tupperware container with a variety of pre sliced fish overlapping each other. Clearly the Singapore "efficiency over quality" syndrome has hit this high end restaurant. The chef drizzled soy sauce on a paper towel, rubbed the fish into the linty paper towel and then applied a generous dollop of wasabi (uh, oh...often the trick to hide the smell of not so fresh fish) before dropping the fish onto the rice.The fish itself varied. The maguro was decent - the taste was good but it was a overly firm. The saba and hamachi were tough enough I could have replaced my shoe sole with them. The maki rolls were almost edible, but the nori (seaweed) was wet and chewy (should be dry and crispy, when fresh). The egg in the tamago roll had clearly been cooked a long time ago - it was dry and very unappetising.My wife had slightly better luck. She ordered the shokado bento. Her sashimi was freshly sliced and half of it was quite good. The rest was firm and not as fresh as it should be - the same as I experienced with the nigiri. Her tempura was oily and tasteless. Other side dishes were okay - not bad, not great.The service. Sigh. As we see in so many of Singapore's restaurants nowadays, the service is rough and uncultured. This is especially noticeable (and sad) in higher end Japanese restaurants where the gentle and fluid staff used to glide to and from the tables, skilfully placing dishes and utensils around the patrons with a smile. Now we get the lumps of misery who tromp from table to table, bumping into and over the customers as they drop plates and food wherever they can, mindless of the crudeness of their actions.There are so many very good Japanese restaurants in Singapore that there is no reason to torture yourself at Aoki - at least for lunch. It may have a completely different countenance at dinner...alas, after the lunch experience I will never go there to find out
4
I love aoki set lunch, the barachirashi and the tuna with rice. I think their set lunch is worth the price. Also, in my personal opinion they have the best truffle wagyu rice even though its expensive and not in the menu. But its worth the try once in awhile. I never tried their omakase however my friend who went to try she said its not worth the price
5
Like all best & top sushi rests that serves fresh imports from Japan, Aoki is my best choice in Singapore as its one that serves mainly deep wild ocean fishes rather than farm fishes which to me, makes the BIG difference & that's why its NEVER cheap to dine at Aoki but go for the lunches, it's a STEAL & Super Value for your money. The lunch dish to die for, is the BARA CHIRAISHI at S$45 with appetiser, soup & desert,,,,, Heavenly 
5
It was a last minute decision to try our luck and fortunately we were squeezed in at 2.15. We had the flounder with shaved truffle followed by the Wagyu Donburi with poached egg on a bowl of nicely cooked rice topped with more shaved truffle. Whilst I enjoyed the truffle its quantum somewhat over powered the flavour of the flounder and beef. But let me stress no complaints merely personal palete preference
4
The set is amazing but costly. Sushi is ok but bento set is very good. Small restaurant so reservations is required.
4
Had a very enjoyable evening with the wife. Sashimi was excellent and so was the sake. We had a nice quiet room and our service was pretty decent. Ambience cozy and comfortable and we'd be happy to return.
5
Had the premium omakase menu... It was excellent. I loved absolutely everything the chefs gave me. Highlights include urchin (which I usually don't even like), amazing sushi rice, white truffles with sashimi (wow)....
4
Super love the lunch here! The chirashi is extremely fresh and very delicious. However, I think that the service is not that good.
4
Tucked away in a corner of Shaw Centre, lies a little sushi shop. We were put into a stifling back corner room. The aircon doesn't work very well there. Fortunately, the chawan mushi was superb, and the sushi set wonderfully prepared. The soy sauce and rice treatment reflects the skill of the smiling chef, who is one of the better Japanese talents around. Pity though, about the lunch price of the sushi set, as one would expect Otoro instead of Chu-toro, at $55

We went at lunch.Although we booked for1215 on the telephone we were not warned about the two sitting policy until 1130 on the day.This is outrageous.The service was brusque bordering on downright rude.No help given or offered when ordering from a small,poorly presented and grotesquely overpriced menu.Very average sushi followed by nearly raw grilled chicken and dreadful fried eggplant.A very bored chef scowls at you in the most unappealing way.This is a place that treats its customers with disdain.This is a place best avoided
3
Was here for lunch with a friend and we were seated at the counterside bar. As we were at the "L" shaped corner of the bar, the part of 2 seated perpendicular to us were just too close for comfort and this affected our experience from the start. Didn't help that they periodically glanced over and commented on our food. Food wise, it was decent. Service could have been more friendly as most of the staff who dealt with us hardly had a smile on their faces

Been there with some friends after a recommendation. Very good references and the place is really nice to visit.They have two shifts for lunch and they are quite strict on them so be punctual. We where 5 and we seated in an downstairs room, up close and nice if you don't have claustrophobia. Since it was a small room with independent air con we could manage to raise temp from 21 to 24, so the meal ambient was perfect.The food is really nice, amazing fish pieces with wonderful taste and the perfect amount of wasabi, just terrific.The only not nice thing is that they brought some starter salad without asking, and it was charged more than 15 each, and we didn't like it, even we payer and left the place.Really a place to go from time to time :-

Need I say more? This place serves hands down the best chirashi don I've ever had. I've been to this restaurant at least 3 times now, and I always order the mazechirashi don lunch set every time. At around 40++ SGD, this lunch set is the most value-for-money, and in my opinion, the best thing on the entire menu.The set includes a salad with waafu dressing, the mazechirashi don, and a dessert. The salad is delicious, with the balance of dressing and vegetables done just right. The star of the show, however, is undoubtedly the mazechirashi don. The sashimi, which comprises of many different types of fish (salmon, tuna, octopus, etc just to name a few), is marinated and cut into small cubes, and rest on top of a bed of warm sushi rice. The fish to rice ratio is almost 2:1, which is what makes the entire experience so enjoyable. You never really run out of fish to go with your rice, which is something that happens often at other Japanese restaurants. Each bite is heaven, and leave you craving for more. Thankfully, the portion size is acceptable, and you'll be left full and contented (unless you're a big eater, then Japanese cuisine in general will leave you still feeling hungry). The dessert may change from time to time, but for me, I had the mango ice cream + sesame pudding + plum wine jelly. The mango ice cream is nice and creamy, and the sesame pudding is delicate and delicious. The jelly however, tastes like soap, and is the only thing I didn't like. I've had friends and family try the other sets, such as the 9 pc sushi set or the cod fish set, but those were fairly average and not as value-for-money. Ultimately, if you're going to Aoki, go straight for the mazechirashi don. I promise you that you won't regret it

I've never liked this place that much since I was a kid. But decided to give it another chance, and was not pleasantly surprised at all. They were cutting sashimi on newspaper!!!! The setting is not bad I'll have to say.. Service was good too. I dont think its expensive. But for the quality i would just go to sushi tei.
5
We came here for lunch. The mazechirashi was amazing and affordable $40. Lots of otoro and uni. Comes with pickles, miso soup and dessert. Perkfect.

My colleague suggest team lunch in November will be at Aoki. So we make the booking. Was not impress that our lunch must be taken from 12pm-115pm - on a weekday?! Arrive and we were given a nice quiet corner (like a room to ourselves - 5 of us). Service is prompt and swift. 3 of us have the Mazechirashi (do pre-order) which is of good value (SGD 40) for a generous spread. The 7 piece nigiri sushi is SGD 55 which is pretty good too.I wouldn't recommend their Ebi Tempura (small 4 pieces at SGD 38), hot pot and the chicken thigh - very ordinary and poor value for money. They have Omakase lunch at SGD 115 which we didn't think about it since they limit our lunch to be within 1hr 15min. Overall is good if you come at lunch and order Mazechirashi and the set lunch

Tried here with my wife months ago but so sorry that recently only get to review as my busy schedules...no regret and not even a single complaint I do say for my visit here to Aoki...my wife actually is the one whom recommended me this restaurant and she decided we shall go and try their Chirashi-Don set during lunch and therefore, I, being a Japanese food lover as well, proceeded to give it a try. She repeated mentioned to me that, during her visit with her friend to this place, they had their best Chirashi ever in Singapore...and I actually do not trust them until I did tried it myself...the don were packed with fishes, and of course, not those original range but mixed with chu-toro as well, uni and so on...it may be a psychological mentally for being diced the fishes to make it feels and looks more rather than slice, but this does not matter to me, it is indeed the quality they give and the quality to serve...In Japanese gastronomy, food is a culture which they highly respect and they highly preserve,,,Aoki serve the standard of this, apologize as i do not give anything a 100% cos I do not believe that there is such a rating in the world...the most is 99%, therefore, out of 99, I will give Aoki a top high of 90% and the best don i ever had in Singapore, except in Japan...but trust me, diner will not get disappointed in what they offer. Nevertheless, the price were consider to be pricey but is is okay, no doubt on the quality given, and frankly, it is not so much of expensive compare to some who deem to call themselves as Japanese Fine Cuisine but ended up...differently...I have yet to seek for a good Kaiseki Cuisine in Singapore...looking forward...Do you do this Aoki
5
This is a really good, solid sushi - traditional Japanese style. The salmon, tuna, kanpachi, etc all were really good. Service was pretty decent as well. Considering the price of everything in Singapore, I think this is a pretty good deal. I can almost eat there everyday! I would put this place on par with most places in Hawaii or California. Of course, prices are a bit higher, but very competitive for Singapore..This place is a thousand times better than that "other" place in International Plaza. If I didn't know better, I would guess that the small number of people who wrote the review for the other place making it #20 in Singapore for a while somehow had a stake
5
I have visited a again this fantastic sushi bar. The first courses offered by chef aoki are so originals that one would like to order another round. The sushi quality of the toro uni are great. The highlight is the Japanese breed with white truffles . Don't miss it's expansive but worth it cheaper than ichi restaurant

"Dinner Minimum Spending $100++ (Mon to Thurs) & $180++ (Fri to Sat) per person *for food only"My friend and I did not know about the minimum spend (although this is one of his favorite Japanese restaurant) until it was whispered into his ears after we ordered. Seriously?? What kind of shi shi place is this?? I've been to plenty of high-class/Michelin-star restaurants that do not treat their customers this way. All I read in reviews before I went was to try the chirashi - the bara chirashi was the cheapest option at $60 (and it was delicious) but being told that I need to order more to hit the minimum spend has left a bitter taste. It is also not good restaurant practice to have a minimum spend that is greater than your cheapest entree option.Note: A lot of the other reviews were glowing but mostly from lunch diners who did not encounter the minimum spend and lunch sets start at $33++

Food always great quality. Lunch set are great value. Dinner can be very pricy if you don't watch what you are ordering. Because of the two lunch sittings, you have to choose between an early or late meal. Atmosphere is good, service ok. Food is key

It was a visit to celebrate a birthday and we wanted to order an omakase. We did not realise that the omakase we wanted was for dinner till the waitress said so and also said we could order it if provided we ate very fast!They made no exceptions for it being a special occasion or a birthday and seemed to only make exceptions to native Japanese clients. There were also no thank you greetings when we left.This was an unpleasant experience and while the food was good, I will not go back for there are other restaurants served by native Japanese chefs at a much higher level of service
4
Had lunch there to celebrate a friend's birthday. There were 3 of us and we were allocated a very cosy booth that would seat up to 4 comfortably. It had sliding doors which could be shut for total privacy. The sets we ordered were extremely value for money. The topping to rice ratio on my chirachi bowl was like 3:1. Very generous, fresh and filling! The only gripe was the stoic service. From the waitress to the maÃƒÂ®tre d... none of them made us feel welcomed. While it wasn't bad service per se, there was much to be desired coming from a restaurant of this caliber. Good thing the food made up for it
5
You should book your spot at the sushi counter ahead of time as this is quite a small restaurant.At the sushi counter, you can have a variety of sushi and sashimi. My favorites are white fish sashimi with truffles, uni, toro, toro neck sushi (slightly torched), beef rice bowl with egg and truffle. Prawn sashimi and eel sashimi.All the nice food come at a (steep) price
5
I am a foodie and will go anywhere in the world for good food. This is one of the best Japanese food I have ever had if not the best. Everything is superb! I really had a great experience there.
5
I am an avid Japanese foodie. Aoki is arguably the top 5 Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Super fresh sashimis and sushis. Set lunch is value for money
5
The best Japanese food I have ever had! The quality is just impressive. It is expensive, but you will not regret it.
5
It is really hard to find Japanese food that is even close to authentic in Singapore, but thank goodness for Aoki! It is authentic from the decor to the service to the sushi chefs to the food! We ordered the mazechirashi, which had delicious blobs of uni and every mouthful was a luxurious burst of flavour. We also ordered the 9 types of Nigri sushi and each sushi was of top quality ingredients. I especially loved the otoro (tuna belly) one which melted in the mouth and the anago. The freshness in Aoki's food is unbeatable. Sashimi fans will love it here
5
Aoki is one of the restaurants done by the Les Amis group. The quality of this place is top notch but remember to make a reservation because the place is small and full most of the time. One thing I like about Aoki is how the decor and food are both equally very authentic. Despite the pricey range of menus, Aoki delivers excellent quality food. I personally recommend you to go for lunch instead of dinner because the price is much cheaper. I had the maze chirashi for only SGD 35 (without tax) and they included expensive item like toro, uni, and ikura. The difference between Maze Chirashi and normal Chirashi is that the fishes are chopped in Maze Chirashi. My friend had the normal Chirashi for SGD 75 (without tax) however the portion is bigger and she had a generous portion of uni. The Chirashis in Aoki is pretty awesome but my friend still prefer Tatsuya's Chirashi. Another friend of mine ordered the Omi Gyu Don with Truffle. Yes, the dish certainly lives up to its name and it was beyond delicious. Sadly, the Omi Gyu Don is not wallet friendly. I forgot how much it costs, maybe around 300SGD? Anyway, I am quite curious of what Aoki has to offer for Omakase... Maybe next time
5
This was the last restaurant meal of my 3-week SEA honeymoon, and it did not disappoint. My husband and I both opted for the "regular" omakase (they have at least 3), and the first few courses of soups, sashimi, grilled fish and tempura were great to excellent, but we were both wondering what the big deal was. Then came the nigiri, and what a revelation. The individually delivered nigiri was hands down the best either of us have ever had. Full disclosure, neither one of us have been to Japan as adults...I wouldn't describe service as warm, but we also could not really fault it. Dishes were brought out one after the other without much wait in between. And pricing, well, yes of course it is expensive, but we felt like it was a good value. We left feeling stuffed, which is not our usual omakase experience, and pricing is on par with fine dining in New York/Boston. The only downside I can think of is that we had a hard time finding Aoki as tourists. There is really confusing construction/signs all around the Shaw Centre, and we walked around in circles for 30 minutes before locating the restaurant. And nobody we asked knew anything either
3
have been a regular for over ten years and for even more years with chef Aoki. Must have been here at least sixty times. This is always been a premier establishment and one of the top 4 sushi restaurants in town. Excellent fish, superb preparation and cutting, good assortment of fresh hikari-mono ( silver fish which dont travel well). Atmosphere is good although being a small space, it can be ruined by an over-happy group. So what's the beef? Aoki is bang in the middle of millionaire town, it is visited by them and by royalty from neighbouring countries. They tend to have, um, elastic wallets. So, Aoki's prices have been creeping up over the years to the point of 'what the market will bear' and this has led to some silly pricing. Couple this to chef Aoki's usually glum visage and you get what i call a dour shafting. This restaurant could tower over every other if they improved their pricin
5
For me, Aoki is one of the best Japanese restaurants outside of Japan. The quality is amazing, they always have a mix of innovative and seasonal dish as well as very traditional sushis and sashimis. The sake list is also very good. You must get a reservation, and it is definitely worth asking to sit at the counter (they have a few small tables at the top, but I would not recommend there). Now, the negative: the bill is directly proportional to the food quality
5
This is definitely not an inexpensive Japanese restaurant. For four of us at lunch, the bill was $1,700 Singapore dollars!Why so expensive? We had four servings of white truffle and flounder sashimi. They shaved some more white truffles on the flounder and it was very tasty. They were also very expensive. The four servings cost about $700 Singapore!Want to know what we ate? Check out the photos. They shaved s lunch
3
We went for lunch and was disappointed considering this is one of the more expensive restaurant in Singapore. Spending $50 for lunch is quite dear.The sushi was average - fish was not as fresh nor were there any specials like fresh prawns or uni or scallops.The small room we were ushered into had very low ceiling and the walls look like they have not been painted for some time.There are better options nowadays in Singapore
4
The presentation was very tempting, it makes you feel you must try it.
When you try it, you will not regret.
It's a good experience.
5
This is a great find on Orchard Road. The kaiseki menu has a range of delicate flavours and fresh ingredients. Must have item though is the saga beef bowl with white truffles. Unforgettable.
5
Good variety of lunch set from $30 onwards with your order freshly made infront of me as I was seated at the bar counter.I ordered the Mazechirashi set that came with a chirashi-don, dessert, miso soup. On top of that my friend also ordered the truffle chawanmushi for me..The chawanmushi came first and there were black truffle bits, truffle oil and shavings on the chawanmushi, no more additional frills but it was the best chawanmushi I have eaten!The chirashi-don comes with a wide variety of sashimi including tuna, tuna belly, sea urchin, fish roe, tamago and many more! It is the most sashimi compared to other chirashi-don I have had and there's a layer of seaweed between the rice and shashimi adding another layer of taste.The miso soup is light and not salty, just nice. The desserts come in sample size which is just right for me as I got to try the Sakura ice cream, umeshu jelly (high concentration of umeshu wine) and the sesame pudding with Okinawa dark syrup.I was a very happy person when I left the restaurant..Feeling overfed! The staffs were very attentive too. There are private rooms available but I recommend sittin by the bar, u'll get to appreciate the art of the chef preparing your food making the whole experience more holistic.Service staffs were also very attentive! Make sure you make reservations to avoid disappointment
5
We go regularly to Aoki and always enjoy it. It does polarise opinion a little sometimes as it can be seen as a little 'non traditional' and it is certainly not cheap.There are probably better alternatives if you are simply after sashimi and sushi but the assortment and variety of much of the other fare on order is extraordinary.The seasonal menu normally carries the dishes with the highest prices but it is always worth it. The quality of the produce is superb and the cooking and presenation is first rate.Service is excellent, friendly and very efficient also. If you are on more a budget, the fixed price menus, especially at lunchtime can cut your bills substantially. We will continue to be regulars
5
Hands down experience. It was through my colleague that I came to know about this small, compact eatery tucked in the corner of busy and blustery Orchard Road.Reservation is required as sitting arrangement is very limited.Sitting at the sushi bar reminded me of my first dining experience in Niigata where chef converse in Japanese with their clients over the sushi table top. Food - no complain, perfect sashimi, perfect presentation.Dessert - no complain, perfect to the last bite.Price - no complain, value for your money, every single cent you paid is well worth.Verdict - perfect Japanese dining experience. Ambience, visual, taste and service screams Japanese. In Singapore, it is really hard to find this sort of Authentic Japanese dining at this sort of price

my wife and i had lunch at the aoki restaurant on the 16 july 2013. we arrived for the first seating at 12pm. on entering, we informed the manager that it was our first visit. they sat us at the counter but at the worst seats possible. for over an hour , the servers would pass their orders to the chefs over my shoulder. on most times , the servers were abrupt and would shove their hands into my face . i understand that this may be counter service but surely they can find a better way to pass their orders to the chefs without disturbing their guests. i also thought that as a first time guest , they would have given us better or the best seats to ensure that we return. what was worst than the unfriendly service was the hygiene. there were about 2 local chefs and the main japanese chef. we noticed that they prepared their sashimi like a mass production factory. this should not be the case for supposedly a high end restaurant owned by the les amis group. raw squid was prepared on the same plate as the raw fish. this is not so good as squib would loose its freshness mush faster than fish. the chefs would use the same cloth to clean our plates and with their hands and their hands would then be preparing the raw food. raw fish and vegetables were allowed to sit on wooden preparation trays for some time. cooks from inside the kitchen area would be coming in and out without cleaning their hands. one of the chefs was asked by a guest to open a box that was shrink wrapped. he used a knife to open the box, put the pox on the tray that fish was cut and used the same knife to cut the fish , without washing the plate or the knife ! it seemed that the main japanese chef has become too "localised" and was not monitoring his other chefs. there is no way this would be acceptable in any high end restaurant in japan. for that matter , we had eaten often at the new restaurant Hashida and the standard there is so much higher , in quality and cleanliness. to the left of our seats , we could see the pantry and it was dirty. the floor was in a terrible state and again this was shocking to see. we have eaten many times at the other Les Amis outlets and they were fantastic. how did this restaurant pass under their radar. the servers were hurrying us as they had another seating at 1.30pm. this was unacceptable for a $100 ++ lunch. Tetsuya at the goodwood hotel is cleaner and the service better for lunch boxes at $30. hopefully the Les Amis group will do something about this before someone becomes ill
4
I will certainly be back for more of grade-A sushi (major score on freshness and yummy rice),the excellent service and great sake recommendation. 3 pcs oysters done 3 ways was a little more than S$50 so you can imagine the rest on the menu. A must try is omi beef truffle donburi. In the end, price is relative so for me what is satisfying is Aoki's credible menu, sense of proportion and simple presentation (where one actually see the dish one ordered undisguised). The place has great ambience for intimate chats and good design for a small space. Closed on Sundays
5
Thoroughly enjoyed the dinner. Great food & service staff. One of very best we had tried. Creative yet traditional fare. Stuffed to brim. Will certainly return. Spent SGD 300 per person. Celebratory birthday dinner. Waku Gin is overpriced and not half as good.Must make reservation. Tiny (cosy) place.
4
Food is beautifully presented, taste is good, but the greatest of all is the freshness of the sushi and sashimi. It is not the run of the mill standard and the freshness comes at a pricey bill and to me, it is not quite so worth it. Service is great
1
What a disgrace! Having booked the restaurant weeks in advance with a confirmation on the day. We arrived to rude staff who deemed our well in advance reservation at the sushi counter was now not available. Most likely the saw the booking was for a non regular, woman and therefore decided to not honour the booking. That mistakes can happen, is understandable, but to not make an effort and to lie about the reservation, unacceptable. I certainly would not recommend a restaurant to anyone with such behaviour, after all Singapore has many top class restaurants who would appreciate ones hard earned money. Spend your money, time and special occasion somewhere else!
5
Although the food (sushi selected by chef and tempura) was exquisit I would not have chosen it had i known the cost. We paid 500 euro (2 persons).
4
Everything is good but the hype exceeds the reality
5
If you want to indulge your self book a seat on the sushi counter and ask chef aoki to serve you menus of his choice .you will be served the best quality the Japanese cuisine can offer from toro which as soft as butter sea urchin from sweet and salt water.kobe beef with white truffles etc et
5
everything from the quality of the food, presentation and service was fantastic. its a small classy place thats not easy to find. the quality of the food put it amongst the best japanese food i have ever had. try the sweet potato tempura which they are now serving as its on their seasonal menu. best i have ever ha
5
Aoki is a true master. If you are lucky you can sit infront of him and watch him make his creations. He uses ingredients in ways you can not imagine. Foe me it is the best non traditional Japanese resaturant in the world. Slices white fisf with truffles, custard with truffles, scallop with uni sauce, matzusaka beef sushi, abalone with special green sauce and so many more..
5
We dine here on almost a weekly basis, whether it's with guests or the fam, and we have yet to have even a less-than-expected experience. Our favourite dishes include the hirame with truffle (even better during the white truffle season!), the abalone, sakura ebi tempura, anago sushi and actually the sushi in general. I usually end the meal with a small portion of the inaniwa udon, and always savour the springy noodles
1
I really do not know where to start...ambience - darkish, standard les Amis lightings. Service - non interactive, far enough you aren't Japanese, but do you have to in mandarin among YOURSELVES when you have am obvious long table of customers? Food - oh boy, do not even get me started.. We had the omekase set and all they could come up with was yam and sweet potatoe (read starch) for cooked food. Sashimi and presentation wise, it's way off the mark of Shinji (which I freq and am never disappointed). Overall, came to this on reading rave reviews online, never again
4
Reviews of this place fall into two categories. It's a love-hate kind of place. Either you adore the superb food and pay a lot of money for the privilege, or you try to go easy on the wallet and end up disappointed with the poor service. I've been several times, and it is certainly true that the staff are interested only in customers with fat wallets. The last time we (2 of us) arrived about 9pm - perhaps later, and sat at the bar as recommended, and spent Sing$900 on food alone - we drank only green tea. We simply asked the chef to give us the best of what he had, and he certainly obliged. Rarely eaten so well in my 65 years. There was one other customer at the bar, and he was eating his way through some kind of Italian/Japanese fusion menu, which looked equally good and he was loving it. Our single chef was solicitous to all of us, and explained everything about the food. An evening like this should have only one ending - to propose marriage!On previous occasions I've not pushed the boat out, but it is worth doing so. Don't go here otherwise. One reason is the seating arrangements are not great, it's rather small, so service can be poor. And that can spoil the experience. Do sit at the bar, and do spend $$
5
The simple black curtain at the entrance belies the extraordinary cuisine prepared inside this gem of a restaurant. Expensive but as the saying goes..."you get what you pay for." The seasonal fish is fresh and quality is outrageously good. Its like it is just fresh of the boat. The chefs take great pride in what they do and if you happen to be regular they may even close an eye to your bringing a bottle of champers to accompany your meal. Go and visit this place, take a date or even a business associate. Believe you me, they will be very impressed. But try and get a seating at the bar counter. The only place to truly enjoy this restauran

Was very much looking forward to dining here after reading the great reviews. The only table available was the counter so we gladly accepted. When we arrived at about 12:20 for our 12:30 reservation, only two other parties were at the counter. We were placed in the middle by the sink. Hoping to sit a bit off to the side, we requested the corner seat which was empty at the time. The waitress said she would check with the reservation staff who came back with a no, saying it was booked. I said I didn't know I could request a particular seat on the counter and she said they reserve it for 3-4 people. At this time, I wish I could have recorded the clearly annoyed faces of the chefs behind the counter like Ramsay's secret diner does. Really guys? Is it that hard to be a little flexible and service oriented? To not give your customers dirty looks as they try to politely optimize their dining experience? When the corner was eventually filled, there were only two diners unlike the 3-4 the waitress said hold the corner for. Needless to say, this simple inability to take care of the customer put a dark cloud over the entire meal...We ordered the lunch set 9 piece sushi and Chirashi. My order and another customer's order (incidentally the one on the corner) came quite a bit earlier than our respective partner's dishes so we were left waiting for some time before we could begin. I found my $50 sushi selection to be okay only. For the premium lunch special, I found it hard to believe they'd have squid, 2 omelette and Tai in the selection. My wife enjoyed her Chirashi but I found the small cubed pieces of premium fish to be a bit of a waste, inevitably causing you to mix many different types of fish into a single bite, defeating the purpose of seeking out fresh, quality sushi/sashimi. Also, I noticed the fish selection for the same dish of guy next to me to be very different!Dessert came with an interesting plum gelatin, custard and a third item which I can't recall. While everything was pretty good, I did notice that we were the only diners to get the small open plates while the other diners' desserts were served in a lovely box.Granted, my overall experience and the lens through which I viewed the food must be tempered by my initial experience, I believe it's the little things that separate restaurants at this level and Aoki definitely fell short
5
You pay for it but it's fabulous. Set menu if you're on a budget, seasonal menu if you celebrating.
5
Went for lunch and tried their beef option which was lovely. My partner had their sushi lunch option for about Â£30, mine was slightly more.

So good, so expensive.

Its like eating in Japan... Really authentic japanese but comes at a cost ...

best Japanese in singapore , heavy on the wallet tho
1
Overly priced, so so atmosphere, lousy service. I would not recommend at all. Never been there since I spent 600+ for dinner!
4
Fresh Sashimi, flame sushi(mouth watering)..Wasabi (direct shavings from the wasabi plant). The leading chefs & staff are very gracious, helpful & especially good-natured & polite in nature)
4
Impeccable sashimi and sushi!
5
Excellent Japanese place - with the prices to match. Some say that you might as well go to Tokyo for the kind of money you will splash out...

I visited Aoki after having heard compliments about the establishment and was severely disappointed by the experience. The culinary standards were fine and as expected but the interaction - lack thereof with staff and chefs marred the experience. I had to request for tea and take charge of my own sake refill. There was no engagement at all with the chefs whilst seated at the counter; the chefs were chatting comfortably in mandarin to each other even with guests present. With so many more dining choices in Singapore, it's sad to see a purported fine Japanese restaurant fall so far behind. The cuisine might have been authentic but the service element is dismal, and I'm not even comparing it to Tokyo standards yet
