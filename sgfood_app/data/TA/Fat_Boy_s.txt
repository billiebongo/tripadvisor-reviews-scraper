Me and my colleague love to go their and have their lunch set. Comes with drinks and only cost us S$ 12.90 for the set. Value for money. Usually they are packed on Friday afternoon.
They have attentive staff too...

Very good burgers. Seems to be crowded and a long que to the tables. Easy to go since a buss stop is close.

Royale with cheese just like Pulp Fiction. Loved it and the truffle fries. Fast service and friendly staff. I'll be back for sure.

I usually am not a big fan of burgers especially from fast food chains but since I had my first burger at Fat Boys, this is the only place that I would go to. You can choose from the variety of sides from calamari to breaded mushrooms which are equally goo. But my favorite is to customize my own burger since I am particular about some offerings within a standard burger. I can choose the type of bun, the patties (beef, chicken, lamb), the fillings and sauce to go with it. If you prefer the house menu, there are a range of house burgers to choose from. Ambience is casual, so go in your shorts and flip flops or bring an overseas guest there. It has an sports bar atmosphere while enjoying a reasonably priced burger. But as compared to a fast food burger chain, then it may be more expensive but if you want to good burger freshly made, then there's no comparison, price notwithstanding

We came here following a friends recommendation. It was midrange pricing for Singapore and did not disappoint. I opted for the vegetarian burger and my partner had a cheese burger. We both both left feeling full and thoroughly enjoyed our meals. We also liked the atmosphere of the street

I'd heard great things about this place but I left very disappointed. I built my own burger... the crispy chicken was soggy and full of fat and skin. I also don't think it was cooked properly as it was very slimey. The mushrooms and sauce had that much garlic in that I may as well have chewed a raw garlic bulb. It was very busy too so trying to get staff for anything was very difficult. We would not go back here.

Terrible experience.... pics are self explanatory..The frozen fries were cooked at the wrong temperature as a result full of oilWorst is the burger..Paddy was a mix of ???They don't ask how you want it as by default they overcooked it Buns was soft They put tons of barbecue sauce to try to hide the poor quality of the ingredients Service on line with their food standards

Difficult to find good burgers in Singapore. This place was the answer for me. Great size burger and good fries. I like the choice of the menu as well. My Favourite is the Swiss mushroom burger and it was great! Decent price, lunch menu is just a few dollars more fast food set lunch. Definitely a place I will go back for future burger cravings

Fatboy's serves up a variety of burgers, including create-your-own-burger. You can select the choice of bun, patty and sauces. I ordered not the CIY (create your own) burger but the one that was recommended by Fatboy's staff. Good enough it was satisfactory. The bun was soft but solid, although the patty was thick it was juicy and tender, and the taste of sauce complimented to the taste of the patty. I liked also the root beer float, the original taste of float that I'm looking for. everything is perfect for me. Kudos to their staff for the Great service! Certainly a burger worth for your weight A must try to those burger lover

Great choice of burgers, make your own choice, great beers to go with the burgers.
Great place to chill out and the music is great for the ears.

I built my own burger and it was really delicious. But even when the price was good it didn't made up the fact that service was slow (eventhoug the place was almost empty).

Another of our favourite hang out, Fries are crispy, portion are huge, nice cool aircond, great ambience though a bit dark inside and great food quality

Didn't like their truffle fries. Burgers are good size and you can select any add ons. Fresh ground beef and cooked right. Value for money.

I met up with a friend to have lunch here, at the Holland Village branch of Fat Boy's. The burger was actually very good. The best thing about this place is that they make your burger exactly as you want it, although you can also buy their standard combinations of toppings if you prefer. personally I like to have it the way I would make it at home. Fat Boy's does it the way you like it without any fuss. Fries with the burger were perfect.As well as burgers they also have a good selection of beers served at appropriate temperatures. Prices are Singapore medium to medium high. A great burger, with fries and a beer works out around S$25 to S$30. The atmosphere isn't exactly "fine dining", but this is a burger joint.

N.B This review is for JOO CHIAT branch,I won't say the food is bad but it's just not good. We ordered a fried chicken burger which had wasabi condiments and mash potato. The chicken was very thin and in general the flavours didn't work well at all for me but the chips were tasty.Next up we ordered the honey mustard chicken kebab which was OK, it was well charred which was the best bit of it, as is always the case. A half decent selection of beer/ipa/ciders too. Well priced place as it came to about S$80 for 3 beers, iced tea and the food

I had the Yolo Burger at Fat Boy's at Serangoon Gardens. All I can say is Wow ! The beef, fried egg, the spam, fried onion strings , mozzarella cheese stick in between 2 buns and a plate of fries. If you intend to have it very often, please consider taking part in marathons every other week. Simply delicious

My family dines at this restaurant from time to time, especially when we have run out of ideas and everyone is too lazy to think. On the whole, the food here, mainly burgers, aren't too bad but they taste almost the same. The milkshakes are good but pricey

We visited this place with a group of 10-15 people on the last working day of the year. The place was secluded. It has a very American theme to the interior. The walls are pained black with graffiti done all over it. The lighting inside also gives it a rustic feeling. We had couple of vegetarians in our group and they had a hard time to chose the meal due to lack of options. Many of the people chose to go for kebabs. The quantity was quite good. The drinks options were also good. Service was bit slow. the first impression of the place was that they server good burgers. May be I should visit this place again and try some other menu. one of my colleague was a regular customer of this joint few years back and recommends the burgers. When its time to try burgers and you are bored of KFC, Burger King, McDonalds etc this place can definitely offer some different burgers with choice of beers

We arrived to this place after dinner. We ordered only x2 hoegarden and x2 house red wine from South Africa. My wine was passable. The hoegarden was good to my hubby as usual. The bacon cheese fries was good and done in properly way. The services seem very friendly. Each of staffs came by to say hi and checked on us. After our glass lower than half they came over took the second orders right away. The burger from neighbor look like Carl's junior burger which cost only 8S$. My burger(the one that satisfy me) prices usually cost approx 19-23 S$. This price that set is considered a fast food burger price to me. Date of visited 30/01/2016 : 22.20 hrs @Boat Quay.
