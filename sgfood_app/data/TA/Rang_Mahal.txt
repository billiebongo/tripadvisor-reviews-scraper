Wife and I had dinner. I ordered the lamb and she ordered veggie sampler.
Service was prompt and ambiance fitting. Surprisingly noisy.

This place serves good authentic Indian food. Great ambiance, great staff, super good food. Overall a very good and satisfying experience.

My wife and I had an absolutely delightful dinner on Valenyine’s day! What a spread it was and how ingenious. I dont think i have raved about food in this way for a very long time.Simply put everything was outstanding! Even the palate cleanser was such a treat!Kudos to the chef! We are definitely coming back very soon

There are some dining experiences which can be remembered for a long long time & one such experience was dining at this restaurant. The ambience is very classy , service is good but it's the food which is the star here. Every dish that we ordered was not only tasty but very beautifully presented. They served a complimentary small starter which looked very pretty & unique but actually a dahiwada cleverly presented. The avocado kebab was unique & served on a black Stone. The lamb chop which my guest tried was very juicy & nice he commented.The main course had a limited selection, but the food was fresh & felt very healthy and light. The dal makhni could have had more butter for my liking, but still was tasty.For dessert the Chef recommended that we tried the Jalebi & it was one of the best Jalebis I have had outside India. Overall a very classy experience. Will surely go back with more friends

Went on wife's birthday. The quality of food was way below expectations. Plus it came at 2-3x the cost. We actually got it packed for giveaway.Being my wife's birthday, I asked for a prior seat reservation. But got a corner table. We asked to change to sofa and it was done.The only good thing was the free cake made out of "gajar halwa". Appreciate the effort for that but honestly not spending any dollar again on that menu

I was there at Rang Mahal on the weekend with my wife to celebrate our Wedding Anniversary. I must say that the service, starting from the initial greeting to getting us to the table and the attention thru out – it was just impeccable. The staffs were polite, attentive without being intrusive, and extremely pleasant in their demeanor. And they had a pleasant surprise for us by bringing a special dessert with a candle to celebrate the occasion (extremely thoughtful, I assume they got from my Chope reservation comment that it’s the anniversary lunch). And the food was just fantastic with well laid buffet options (just that the Paneer burji? was a bit underwhelming). Special mention to Ms. Saha, who were assigned to our table
2
My wife and I opted for this North Indian restaurant in the hope of enjoying some good home food, having enjoyed lovely Sichuan, Cantonese and Italian food for the past week we spent in Singapore. We were overjoyed to get a confirmed reservation by James whose response was prompt and friendly. We went for avocado kebab and tandoori lobster with Indian Masala besides beverages. Beverage being bottled in France tasted fine. But both the dishes were served cold and the lobster was overcooked besides being cold. We did convey our unhappiness with the food, paid and left the place. Probably, it was not our day
5
I was invited to try the buffet lunch and it was a real treat. One chef station, hot appetizers direct from the kitchen and a range of options from the buffet table.The chef noticed from across the room that my partner and I had found the soup spicy and quickly offered us a non-spicy version from the a la carte menu. This is what we call service
4
Went for Dinner, impressed by decor, a Modern look and with good ventilation, there was no smell normally associated with Indian restaurants.The servers were very prompt and excellent service.The food was nice tasty and their mouth fresher between appetiser and main course was very nice Spicy sorbet. The Kebabs were good, Dal Makhani was average, Tawa Prawn (Kind of King prawn) was disappointment as it was overcooked and very chewy.On pricing, it was way too expensive
4
Service was attentive and pleasant. Food was vibrant, full of flavour and nicely presented. Large dining room with high ceiling, decorated in modern hotel style, which left the restaurant feeling a little empty even though it was half full. Food came a tiny bit too quickly too, so we filled up fast and left after 1 hour.
5
I have eaten here a few times and its always top notch. Hard to fault. Great food, and a good selection. Attentive, friendly staff.

~I'd booked Rang Mahal from my memory of it way back when it was the signature restaurant at the Imperial Hotel for 2017Feb LoHei for our P-Marketers~from the entrance you make a left into a long dark lit hallway into a beautifully decorated dining room~I'd approached the staff and requested to have them arrange to accommodate a Chinese New Year YuSheng tossing in their Indian restaurant and it was readily accepted, they didn't bat an eyelid... they sprang into action making the calls to the Chinese restaurant Hai Tien Lo for the sets we needed and waited patiently till my partners arrived :)~it was a super eventful night with an Indian feast without the mandatory dancing at the end and we'd even taken a few video testimonials in the dimly lit restaurant for our collection!a memorable evening that has pre-dinner cocktails and post dinner drinks with my business partners! My highest recommendations for the food & the superb service

We ordered 3 take away chicken biriyanis tonight. Waited nearly an hour to collect it. Little did we know that we had huge surprise waiting for us.Can't believe the rice was literally raw. It wasn't cooked at all. Never expected this from so called Michelin rated restaurant. Terrible service and extremely disappointing food. When we called the restaurant to inform they did nothing as service recovery either. Never coming to your restaurant ever again. For that price I would rather treat a whole gang of friends at a local restaurant.
5
In my recent trip to Singapore, we were strongly recommended to try out Rang Mahal for good Indian cuisine. We tasted the Sunday lunch buffet which was impeccable in its taste and had a very authentic flavor, with a large variety of dishes to choose from. The staff was cordial and helpful and the overall experience was great. The kheema paav is a special mention and the Indian desserts were to die for. I would definitely recommend this place
5
The best Indian food weâ€™ve eaten!Excellent menu delightfully prepared with authenticity and impeccable care. Wonderful ambience with pleasant, attentive and discrete service from the first moment you are met for your fine dining experience. Centrally located in a beautiful setting and highly recommended! Do yourself a favour, dine at Rang Mahal Singapore
5
On my recent visit to Singapore, I was fortunate to be hosted to this delectable fine- dining restaurant. The soothing ambience,impeccable service and above all, the classy and authentic Indian food was a treat to my senses. The presentation of the food took the whole experience of dining to a different level. I relished the lamb chops, avocado tiki and their baingan bhartha which exceeded my expectations. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection and the overall quality of food was simply top notch,which left little place for trying any dessert.An enjoyable experience which , I am certain, will bring me back to this place again

Rang Mahal's Buffet had been on my list for quite some time, So finally we decided to try their Lunch Buffet. We arrived on time. Front staff greeted and took us to our reserved table. Ambience is good. On weekend lunch the restaurant was less than 50% occupied. They served us tomato soup which was good. After that we had to wait a long to get their starters which they were serving on the table. We had told them one of us is Vegetarian and to get Veg starters but they kept getting non veg.even the wait for non veg was Long . Just two starters were served on table chicken tikka and calamari. They didn't have much options for vegetarians when we asked them what you have, the server didn't know what to say and asked us to get salads and other chaat from the buffet menu. With a boring start we decided to abandon the starters and go straight for the main course. The options for Non Veg were very few just two veg curries and two Non Veg (one was dry) the paneer mutter, kadhi pakoda , chicken curry was disaster. I never ever had such a bland tasteless main course in a fine dine restaurant .In the salads menu they had Poha Chivda filled in small (like tequila shot) glasses . What ? who serves that Poha Chivda in salad Menu, come on ?? . We asked for only Tandoori Roti but were served only Naan. Had to again wait long to get Roti. After extreme disappointment with Main course we thought desserts might be good. Again not much options the only good dessert was Rabdi . There was jalebi but it was quite cold. The only two things good was tomato soup and Rabdi. it was not even worth half the price. In Singapore you would get far better buffet food at a 1/3rd the price that we paid here, so visiting this place for Buffet is waste of money and I would never ever visit them again. Since the food taste and quality was not good i am sure their Ala carte would be equally disappointing . Not recommend at all

I have been to many fine dining restaurants all over the world. Rang Mahal claiming to be fine dining is a myth. I have been to Sunday buffet. The spread on the menu is very minimal. The taste is very normal. I cook better at home than the dishes served at restaurant. They charged a whopping 12$ for a lemon soda, which was full of artificial lemon concentrate . We have requested them to change , we get the same lemon soda with diluted version. The buffet charge 68++ is incomprehensible. Service was slow though staff were courteous. It was a bad and poor show by restaurant ruined my expectations and treat. None of them liked it. The starters and deserts were bit decent. Main course was horrible. I couldn't get any reservations in any of the other hotels due to Christmas season, as a last resort had to opt for it. Local Indian restaurants tasted much better . Please don't claim it's fine dining and charge customers a bomb in the name of Indian food. Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!
2
I have been to Rang Mahal several times before. This time the food was disappointing. The salmon tikka was undercooked.
5
This is a late post.... the decor of the Pan Pacific and the entrance to the restaurant tells what to expect when you step in. Neverthless to say Shiva and his team display the best of service you would experience. Coming to the food, there are plenty to eat. We were full just with tasting out the food. Live counters, food served to table straight from kitchen, dessert to tea.... just everything was spot on. Thank you
5
Very good authentic Indian food. Would advise you to book table for comfort. They do not take order after 10 pm.
4
A great array of food in the buffet with a very friendly and helpful staff. The food was delicious and very well thought out!

Located at Pan Pacific Hotel! Enjoys good ambience! Both indoor and outdoor! Nice service! Full Indian menu though limited! Price wise on higher side! Good for business meet and dine n wine! Good for families also! Pre-booking recommended.

Went to rang mahal with the office colleagues for a buffet lunch. The quality and taste of the food was quite good however the spread available for the price you pay is quite Low. Also the service I felt was not 5 star category. While the intent of the staff was not bad, I feel they need a bit more training. Eg while serving the breads, my colleague asked for tandoori roti and the staff serving had only garlic nan / plain nan left in her basket to serve. So she kept insisting that I have only these breads with me now (she didn’t say this but meant that I will finish them serving before I get any refill ). She didn’t even offer to get what we wanted. Dessert section was interesting and a had some variety. The pepper vanilla ice cream sounded innovative and tasted nice but a little more pepper flavour would have given it a better taste. Overall a mix of good and average stuff...!
4
I was a big fan of Rang Mahal before its renovation a few years back. The buffet is still pretty good and the ambience is excellent, I do find the staff a little prickly, my observation is that a smaller party i.e. 1 or 2 people gets lesser attention. The overall experience is still pretty good, the service experience doesn't come into play for buffe
5
Enjoyed the Sunday afternoon lunch with family and friends at rangmahal @ Panpacific. Great location, Fantastic interior and outdoor decoration with contemporary theme. This is way different from the so many other restaurants in Singapore.Food is North Indian but there is a certain fusion twist to it. Traditional favourites such as butter chicken and paneer makhani tasted little enhanced. I would definitely go back to Rangmahal agai
3
i have been to this restaurant many times. Last Tuesday when I was there, I felt that there was a significant drop in variety. I was disappointed. The food was tasty and the staff were, as always, courteou
3
Probably it was nicer when it was part of the Pan Pacific hotel and perhaps now they operate independently now, food is ok, not much variety though for the expensive lunch buffet, yet not bad either.
5
Wery Nice restaurant room with good ambience and tastful art, å sence of luxury and ellegance. Staff always friendly and eager to help and assist whenever needed.Food fabouless both presentation and taste, you would feel that they used first grade product threwout. A totaly perfect evening, and totaly worth ewery penny, by the way they had a really superb wine and beverage list

The restaurant atmosphere is soothing and romantic. Me and my wife are treated with great hospitality service from walking us into restaurant, meal ordering and meal delivery. Just when we are done with our food with great joy, along came this oriental lady service crew (dressed in black) whom was mumbled to us, which we couldn't understand a single word she said. She handed us a feedback paper with a yellow piece of paper written with the word "Lindy" shortly after. I just smiled and acknowledged it. We assumed she is the "Lindy" written on the paper. My wife and myself are greatly annoyed by this oriental lady behavior when she kept popping by our table asking if we have finished writing. After discussing with my wife, I queried on the names of the other service crew, we would like to complement but this lady told us this paper is not for them and they are not important. We felt that this staff was very unprofessional for her answer.Furthermore after handing over the feedback paper back, I asked her for my glass to be refilled. She simply ignored us. Our dining experience was disgusted by such unprofessional behaviour. This is a bad apple that spoil the whole bunch. Nevertheless in a positive note, we would like to thank the Chef for our great meal, the bespectacled Indian lady for walking us into the restaurant, the bespectacled slender oriental waitress (introduced herself as "L") for her great food recommendation, the Indian gentleman (dressed in long-sleeved white and grey dress vest) for our beverage refills and frequent checks (if we need anything further) and lastly the bespectacled oriental gentleman (seen him gliding across the dining hall with food trays) for delivering our dining plates and foods to our table hot. Thumbs up for these unsung service crew and keep up the great work

This place is amazing as always.. a bit pricy but that's what keep it uncrowded. The starters and everything is amazing. Worth the money and a must visit place...
4
Pretty good buffet, but could be better, specially for the price. But service is always good and the add ons served at the table are special.
5
We enjoyed a nice and relaxing dinner at Rang Mahal. The food was delicious and wine excellent. The restaurant pricing seemed a bit high but presentation and service was outstanding.
5
The perfect spot for a ranting dinner for two woth well portions exquisite food in a contemporary style and setting.
3
We went in with high hopes and maybe that was the problem, the staff weren't helpful and the food was mixed. Some dishes were lovely while others were underwhelming. For the price and Michellan star we would expect fantastic food and service. Take note they have a dress code of no shorts during weekdays which no one informed us of when making the reservation. The men in our party were literally forced to wear sarongs over their long shorts which looked ridiculous. Meanwhile another diner was wearing a baseball hat and another female diner had shorts on (no sarong). Better places to spend your money in Singapore
5
I've never seen such cooperative & helpful restaurant staff in my whole life! The buffet usually closes by 02:30PM & we used to visit only 5 minutes before closure time; however, we were never refused entry & neither were our orders declined.Food is typically Indian cuisine & very tasty / delicious.Shorts are not allowed; so I'd to wear a Sarong that the restaurant offered whenever I entered.Slightly expensive as its a "fine dining" restaurant
3
We went for a family dinner recently and ordered a bunch of starters. The seekh and tandoori veg was average but nothing out of the world. For mains, we had the rogan josh, chicken tikka makhani, yellow dal and aloo gobhi. I would say that Rogan Josh was the winner, however, i have had much better ones elsewhere. Quantities also seem to be on the smaller side. Considering the prices charged, that's the least one should not be scrimping on.Amongst desserts, Rasmalai was really good but the gulab jamun & anjeer kulfi were a bit disappointin
3
Went for the lunch buffet which was a mixed experience. The restaurant was quite empty at 1245 but filled up gradually. Ambiance is very neutral and lacked personality. Not much in terms of starters which was disappointing. The mains were excellent and the highlight of the meal - not too heavy and a good spread. The grilled prawns and grilled vegetables were delicious. The biryani and dal were also good. The real disappointment was the desert selection- the quality of the falooda and shrikhand was very mediocre. I did complain to our server and he got us some kulfi for the table which was great. The shock was when we got the bill and he charged us for the kulfi's - (70$ for three) which I thought was ridiculous. Rang Mahal really needs to focus more on customer service and clarity of communication.
2
We went there in a big family group for dinner. We had heard a lot about the place for Indian cuisine. The ambiance was nice. But other than that everything else was just average. Starters were OKish. Mains were horrible and so were the Indian breads.service was also not upto the mark
2
I was there with my family and friends for dinner the place is in a hotel the ambience is nice but the quality of food is not upto the mark the starter are ok but the main course is bad it is highly overpriced and the service is slow
5
Good food, great service. Variety was excellent. Ambience just perfect. Starters were worth mentioning - mix of veg and non veg
3
Returned to Rang Mahal for the outstanding food that they serve (but at outlandish prices > USD 100/head without alcohol). Food was excellent as usual but the experience was marred by the below par ambiance in a fine dining top-of-line restaurant. The experience was going quite nicely till the time for closing approached. Suddenly the atmosphere was disrupted by table cloths being tossed on to the adjoining tables, followed by empty glasses being carried in 2s and 3s and clanging of cutlery and then the actual replacement of the table cloths on the adjoining tables. To our amazement, even an iron was brought out to do away the creases on the newly placed table cloths. There appeared to be a total disregard for the customers who happened to be in the restaurant paying $$$$$$ for having a peaceful meal. The matter was brought to the attention of the manager who expressed the required amount of regret but then did nothing to stop the onslaught. I have experienced similar disregard at other restaurants also but of lesser stature than the Rang Mahal. In my opinion it is only fair to the customers in the restaurant to not subject them to the onslaught of tablecloth/cutlery/crockery replacement activities and that such activities should be done only after the closing hour of the restaurant. So go to the Rang Mahal with lots of $$$$$$ for the food but do go early to avoid being harassed by the tablecloth/cutlery/crockery replacement activities
3
A very good restaurant for you to dine with a great ambiance. Located in a five star hotel gives you that extra edge. But I found the service disappointing as the staff took their own time to come down and take orders and the food was not that great, but not disappointing also. Given the wallet factor, it could have been better
5
Being an Indian comes with a curse of never being able to appreciate true authentic indian food while travelling. This restaurant is a charm to break that curse. We thoroughly enjoyed the food here and even ordered extra as take away. The veg options are numerous. Only disadvantage is that it might cost lesser to book a ticket back to india and have a meal ther
5
So we decided too go to Rang Mahal for my hubby Birthday with my 2.5 young daughter and the experience was fab!! Awesome friendly people, nice comfortable high chair which for sure is important when you going with a baby!! The food was great, we surely had a great time and came back with a smile.The jalebis were brilliant and so was the dal makhani!! Will surely go again :

With a group of 7 for dinner with varying experience with Indian food and different spice preferences. They prepared tastings of several dishes, tailored to taste preferences, beautifully prepared and presented. While not the best Indian food I've had, it was very good. The service was attentive but not obtrusive. Very enjoyable evening.
5
Excellent food, nice atmosphere and good service. Business clients love variety of rich Indian crusine
3
I've been staying in the Pan Pacific a lot lately and, sometimes, being too apathetic to leave the hotel for dinner, I've opted for Rang Mahal. In my view, its incredibly expensive for fairly ordinary Indian food. Some dishes - like the butter chicken - are good but overall the food is nothing special. Chicken briryani is one of my favourites but Rang Mahal's version was dry and just tasted a bit weird. Plenty of other great (and less expensive) Indian options in Singapore
3
we were very much looking forward to a high-quality Indian dining experience. While the food was very good, the service staff was obviously under-trained. Things didn't start well. Waiting second in line at the reception desk, the hostess remained on the phone for 10 minutes talking with a future guest. When the group in front of us was seated, we followed and were very surprised to find the restaurant only 25% full. After all that rigmarole at the start, we thought it must be very busy. After an interminable wait for service, we ordered drinks and then two courses. They came in this order: drinks, my wife's first course, amuse bouche and a bread basket, and finally my starter after I made some noise about it. The soup was something or other with truffles. Upon delivery and no visible truffles, we asked about it. None of the servers knew. We asked to see the Chef. When he came out, we asked 'did we misunderstand?' No he said, it is only served with truffle oil. That's a big difference and would have been nice to know. He simply shrugged. After my first course arrived, we asked for a manager and told him we thought the service was not on par with the level of dining. Naturally from that point on, we had his and his staff's undivided attention. Things went much better and we had a lovely evening. I don't really know what has happened. This restaurant got big accolades when it came out; I think they've just slipped and need to get a better manager and training program in place. There were certainly enough staff, they just needed to be taught

At here twice, both times got the prawn/mango app. Was excellent, the entire menu was very good. Had a large group so I tried a little of a lot of things :-

We went to this restaurant for a family dinner . To be honest , I was disappointed.They have tried very hard on presentation and platter , but taste wasn't that fantastic.Their lamb chop was dry . Mutton Briyani was a bit too spicy . However , their grilled prawns and scallop was good . I had visited this restaurant nearly 10 years ago , and there was way too much of difference in service and food standard. Our first visit we still remember how we were s eves and what we had . But now it was a bit of disappointment.Overall , paying $673 for a family dinner and a bottle of wine , I was expecting something more memorable.
3
In spite of having lived in Singapore for over 25 years, this was our first visit to Rang Mahal. Had we come here 10 or 15 years ago (when competition was lesser), we may have been impressed, but this was a major disappointment. While it is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful and classiest Indian dining rooms I have seen, the food - while good - is not great. If Dum Pukht in Delhi is a 10, this would be a 6. In fact, I find the food at Punjab Grill at MBS more memorable, in spite of the lowly location. The tandoori chicken was far, far too dry, he dal tadkewali and Jodhpuri paneer makhni too watery (as was the raita). The signature lamb chops was not memorable, only the raarha gosht was superior. Service is good, but you have to remind waiters for warm water refills - not acceptable at this level of pricing (over SGD 110 per pax for lunch before alcohol)
4
Went back for a weekday lunch buffet at the invitation of the manager. Excellent selection, some the usual ones, some different. Especially noteworhty is the seabass in coconut gravy, which could be used as a cunky soup. Appetizers and naan served at the table. I especially like the Lamb kebab; woudl also recommend trying the chaat items. Dessert selection is huge, but I would pass up on the usula stuff and go for their unique creations. All in all an excellent experience
3
Brunch on Sundays before use to be outstanding; this time very basic, simple and service much below expectations. Not much offers on Buffet; options offered not good as well; spoiled my Sunday lunch with wife.
4
I really enjoyed the great service and hospitality at Rang Mahal. It has an exclusive feel, not like the mass buffets which is the norm at most five star hotels in Singapore. The food was good, the service attentive and friendly. Great ambience, good food, exclusive restaurant, it made my day! I was at another top hotel for dinner, and the food and service was below that I experienced at Rang Mahal
4
The restaurant is upscale and provides an Indian fine dining experience There is a lunch buffet that has a great selection of well prepared veg and non veg. Don't fill your plate as the food keeps coming as servers placd morsels of food on your Plate Save room for desert Good service great ambiance and authentic cuisine that is well prepared
5
The restaurant itself was very modern and swanky. Service was good. Food also delicious especially dessert.
2
For a city that boasts of 8 of the top 10 chefs running operations here, this restaurant should have their sleeves rolled up!We ordered room service from this place (we were guests at the Pan Pacific). Just two basic dishes and the food tasted like Indo-chinese! To be fair they have their own inventions (Jodhpur Chicken!) which was a nice try, but far from authentic (there is no such dish!).
3
This review is only about their epicurean meals for dinner. I was there last week for a business meeting with a colleague from out of town. Thought I will treat him to a fine Indian meal.The ambiance and service are great, although I am not too sure of the entrance to the restaurant. What is with this dark tunnel like entrance anyways!Any case we ordered their epicurean meals, one without and one with the dessert. The appetizers were good, but not great; would have expected the chicken tikka to be much better. Liked the presentation of the appetizers, though. The touches with the shot of coconut water at the start of the meal and strawberry sorbet between the appetizers and the main course were nice.The main course was the biggest disappointment. Just the look of it was enough to put me off. Would have expected much better from such a fine dining establishment, especially considering the price ($98 for the 3-course option). On top of that, the daal and cauliflower-potato servings were pedestrian. Even the non-veg options were so-so. You could get better food for 2/3 the price at so many of the restaurants in Singapore, and I have been to most of them.Finally, even the waiters got our order wrong. Both of us had ordered the non-veg option but received one set of non-veg and one of veg starters. We accepted them for the sake of variety but had to send the order back when the main course also arrived the same way.All in all walked away $275 poorer and all we had was a very ordinary meal. Kudos to the service, the ambiance, and the nice touches, not to mention the appetizers. The presentation of the dessert was also nice, even though it didn't have enough sweetness for my taste
4
The atmosphere is elegance with high ceiling and tasteful interior decoration plus dramatic lighting on the entrance pathway. Table setting is neat & nice, with fine china wear, glassware, silverware and flatware. Service is warm and hospitable. 6 of us took the $58++ lunch buffet. There's more than a dozen starters, main courses and desserts respectively. It is impossible to sample all, except to feast with my eyes. A handful of entrees, soup and mixture of naan basket were served on the table. The taste is authentic and optimally spicy that one can still taste the freshness of ingredients. This is an excellent place for india fine dinning, and they have a beautiful private room for 20 pax. It is expensive, but good value compare to other fine dinning restaurants in town
4
Took the 4 course Valentines menu. The lobster appetizer was the best among the 4. Good place for dining if non-indians like to have a switch of taste for that day.
2
Horrible buffet at a staggering priceI don't mind paying price for something which is worth dine in experienceSingapore was always known for good service but with what we have experienced in rang mahal last week was terrifying and annoyingFood was cold and biryani was bad as meat had a smell . When complained to server, response was very sad as well and no manager approached to extend apologiesDrinks took 25 mins after we sat down, not a very busy time as it was a weekday However, what is disappointing is that so called fine dining experience is not even worth comparing to a normal stand alone restaurant Managment needs to review both sides of business i.e kitchen and service as neither nor compliment the price they chargeWe shall highly not recommend people to visit and pay such an exuberant price for such a sad mea
1
Extremely overpriced and authenticity is 6.5 over 10. Food taste is average and dint deliver the right volume of spice. Service is 7/10
4
Food was good, good quality indian fare. However the menu is a little limited, could have more meat items. Also we thought the drinks came with the buffet as we were asked what drinks we will like to have, but were charged $15++ for a lassi, maybe can be communicated cleare
5
Some friends treated us to dinner here. It was great. Located at the 3rd level of the Iconic Pan Pacific hotel - itself a wonderful place. As you enter, you feel a sense of warmth, as we were led to our table. Seating was comfortable. Lighting was dim but very sedate and relaxing. The hotel offered some very delectable dishes. We opted for a vegetarian a la carte fare that was well prepared, served very well and extremely tasty. Thanks to all of the staff who were well turned out, courteous and helpful. Thank

I has lunch at Rang mahal with a friend recently. The newly refurbished interiors are pleasant and soothing. We choose the buffet at $58 per person. The spread was quite lavish but not overwhelming. The mutton biriyani was excellent as were most of the other eight or so dishes. I highly recommend the place for a romantic lunch or dinner. Or for a business lunch

I've eaten good Indian food across the world but never been charged such outrageous prices for the privilege

During our 6-night stay in Singapore, my husband and I had an evening for which we had not selected a restaurant. Gideon, the very helpful concierge at our hotel, suggested and made a reservation for us for that evening at Rang Mahal. Within walking distance, it was very convenient to our hotel - the Conrad Centennial Singapore.The restaurant is a very elegant, stylish venue, with a high ceiling, clever lighting, and the use of a red back-lit feature wall and other tasteful décor elements create drama and ambience. The spacing of tables was a good distance between each and meant that there was privacy for diners.We totally enjoyed the excellent, authentic fine-dining Indian cuisine. The interesting, extensive menu, with quality produce and ingredients, combined with wonderful presentation and plating elevated the taste and visual experience to a higher level. Small innovations and extra touches were appreciated.  There is a very good wine list, well selected and very suited to Indian cuisine. The staff provided professional, warm, unobtrusive service, and when consulted, offered good recommendations about the menu. They also refilled my water glass each time it was almost empty, which is something that a lot of restaurants neglect - very appreciated. We would highly recommend this restaurant for a very memorable evening. We will dine here again upon our return to Singapore

We were seeking a really good quality Indian meal in Singapore and settled on the Rang Mahal after some research. We chose a very quiet night, however the decor make it both inviting and stylish. For appetizers we ordered both of the tasting plates and found them generous and full of delightful tastes. For mains we both chose chicken and thoroughly enjoyed the succulent meat and excellent spices. Along with the food a couple beers and glass of wine complemented the food, which was also supplemented by small offerings such as initial tastes and a mid-course sorbet. Service was impeccable.The price was certainly top end @ $280 for two courses and drinks but we enjoyed and would recommend if you are wanting a top quality experience
4
Look forward to eating at Rang Mahal when in Singapore. Have been there many times and have always found it a great experience!The food is always good and the setting is fabulous! The service too is high class and makes for an enjoyable experience each time. A place I look forward to going to when in Singapore

- Good food, specially Indian cuisines to match real Indian food taste
- Possible to accommodate large group and apt for business meetings

Big variety, good selection including soup, salads, main course and excellent deserts. Breads, garlic naans prepared at moment.. 58 sgd++

An excellent restaurant. The food was just right, service was good and the ambiance and design of the place was top notch.
5
Fantastic food and service. The staff were so nice and attentive. We had many courses and guided by good recommendations from our host
5
This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Asia with a very wide selection of Indian food but served at a three star level in other words not your traditional curry place but way above that . Also the wine list is very good Service is very good and last but not least also the location is beautiful very classy So when in Singapore and in for an Indian meal a must visit Obviously prices are a little higher but it is really worth it

Did a lot of research and landed on this recommendation. The restaurant is very inviting, with clever use of lighting creates a great ambience.Extensive menu with incredibly high prices - for example a samosa for $30 is extreme in anyone's book. We settled for the set menu and went with the vegetarian and non-vegetarian options so we could share. Great tasting food, not large portions but we found them just right. All dishes were great, couldn't fault them, thoroughly recommend both vegetarian and non-vegetarian.Staff were attentive but not intrusive and the service was perfectly timed.And now to the drinks......3 x Kingfisher beers for $42 dollars just blew us away and this was the cheapest alcohol option.Overall, with two set menus (2 courses), two bottles of water and three beers, the bill came in at $284 - shame they price themselves so extremely because the food was great but not worth $284

Staying at Pan Pacific and decided to try the Rang Mahal restaurant. Great ambience but service was a bit slow at first but after a quiet word , it improved and was excellent . Food choices were a bit bewildering to a couple of brits but staff were helpful in advising..Not cheap but very enjoyable
4
I was staying at the Hotel Pan Pacific to attend a conference at the Suntec convention Centre.Our group decided to try the Rang Mahal for dinner.The place is quite popular and we had to book in advance for our group of 10.The entrance has an imposing wooden statue of the elephant god - Ganesh.The decor is good with soothing low lights.The cuisine is authentic Indian.The choice is quite large.The service is a bit slow.You can choose from alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages.A variety of starters and from several main courses and yes the desserts.It is fine dining indeed and be prepared to spend time and enjoy your food

great food, great ambience....world's best gilauti kebabs were served here in the past but not now....I wish they do it agai

Had I read the trip advisor reviews I wouldn't have gone there because 1 in 4 visitors were dissatisfied. They rated the restaurant terrible, poor or average. I am surprised that the general manager of Pan Pacific seem to have ignored the reviews. I hope this review will help.I ordered broccoli patties, chick pea curry and steamed rice for one person. Additionally few pappadam were served. Pappadams were heavily over spiced with pepper. So were the patties and chick peas. To the credit of the Chef broccoli patties were well presented and rice was good. All dishes were from very basic and inexpensive raw materials but the price was exorbitant at SGD 96. If the dishes were of exceptional quality I would not complain about the price. You don't need to be a cook to know that for enjoyment of any dish spices have to be balanced.Just after I ordered the meal I invited two of my friends to join me for dinner tomorrow expecting food to match up to the high standard of the hotel. Half way through dinner I changed the venue
5
The food is superb. The service is really high class. Interior is really high end. The lamb vindaloo and Naan is the best match!

If you are looking for Indian's food, you better go somewhere. This is not a high end restaurant, the services is just like a shopping center which is not a hotel services. The food is just less than 10 choices for you to go with, and just alright not that excellent.Please be aware of the annoying Indian auntie who walk around and recommend you to try some food, she will give you a terrible face if you never go for the one she recommended. She do not have a uniform but she walked around clear some tissue paper and unwanted items at the table, I have no ideas who she was. The dessert's table have very limited variety, less than 10 items perhaps. The dessert presentation with a low skill literally, the fruit serve in a small bowl which is not fresh at all. Worst thing is they never refill their dessert, which is impossible for buffet, of course we asked but the answer was " Sorry mam today is a busy day for us so dessert like cheese cake is run out of stock " never mind !! We asked for the fruit, the answer was the same. Additionally they have a food tag for coconut ice-cream, so we just scoop it a try and believe it or not this is obviously vanilla ice-cream, we asked them again and they admitted that this a vanilla-ice cream and the excuse was they run out of coconut ice-creme and the reason they did not change the tag is because they do not have it, we told them if you do not have it then you make it, we please them to change the tag to vanilla ice cream. I'm so fed-up and I hope this restaurant will just close. Oh my god I really want my money back. This is my very worst experience with buffet ever

I had a buffet lunch here as part of a large group. The restaurant surroundings and setting are very elegant. The buffet selection wasn't huge but it was a good size and the quality, variety and taste of the food was excellent. Service was attentive, price is on the high side but if you are looking for a Indian fine dining experience then this is a great option
1
The food is average. Standard Indian food with flavours but not spicy.The worst part is the disgusting service.People with no common sense work in this restaurant. Staff to management.1) They cancelled our reservation when we were late. Tried calling them to hold it 8 times but didn't pick up the phone. Cancelled because they said it was a no show.2)Ran out of deserts at 1.15pm. Right in the peak of lunch, no ice cream no cakes. Told they would not replenish. Running out of deserts for a high class restaurant at 1.15pm is not an excuse whether you are busy or not. We went on a weekday afternoon with empty tables.3) Staff said that they will replenish but started giving us attitude. Did not attend to us did not go into the room we were in. Manager even came in eventually after waiting for 30 mins to say in a very sarcastic tone that the chef made it specially for us. If they chef didn't make it for us. Would you like me to make it myself in your kitchen?4) No service recovery, no apology, manager didn't even want to hand us the bill.Will feedback this to Pan Pacific Management just in case their negative service spreads to the Pan Pac Hotel

My Indian colleagues recommended this restaurant to me as they said it's one of the best. So I decided to take my Indian colleagues and team to this place for business lunch. Made reservations at 12 on a Friday. We called the restaurant number 5 times to let them know we were running late but no one picked up so we went straight. Upon arriving, we were ushered to a table that was not yet cleaned - there were plates and soiled napkins from curry. Upon realisation of the mistake, they told us they gave that table to somebody else because we were late so we were given the private room which was a good service recovery initiative. I told them they can check their landline caller ID if they have to see I called several times. The spread is limited, not wow, just okay - so I must say neutral. The main concern was on the dessert. The coconut ice cream and cheesecake were really popular among the crowd that day. We went to have our appetisers and mains first. At 1pm there's nothing left on the dessert table except few Indian desserts. Both coconut ice cream and cheesecake were finished. They refilled the ice cream but it was vanilla. The signage still said coconut. So a number of people were disappointed, not just our table. They've not refilled the cheesecake again. We asked if they will refill and they said they will. Waited for 10 mins and nothing. They came back to say there's no more coconut ice cream so they just refilled it with vanilla. We told them to replace the signage as it was misleading. They did afterwards. No cheesecake refill as well. We requested if we can speak to the manager to let them know but no one came. Requested 3 times. No one came. Our Indian colleagues were also unanimous in their disappointment in terms of food and service. So we'll not come back nor recommend this to our friends.

Authentic Indian cuisine with variety of spread and fine flavoured spices offered complementary. Sitting right inside the Pan Pacific a good place for family or corporate meetings with quiet surroundings and style. The menu might appear expensive but the quantity is more then sufficient. Perfect candle light dinner with your spouse to make her Day and pick the signature Pani Pure and some non veg Tikkas and butter chicken. Must go place
5
My wife and I had an excellent dinner at this leading Indian restaurant which is situated at the Pan Pacific hotel in Singapore. The restaurant has won many awards as one of the best restaurants in Singapore and one of the best Indians in Asia. We think that title is well deserved. The ingredients were clearly of the very best quality like for example their large stufed chilies, paneer, fenugreek, etc. All things that are very important to us as vegetarians. Also the cooking techniques were worthy of the best master chefs. You can see, smell and taste the difference. They had a menu that was a good combination of classics with original twists, that really work rather than just being innovative for trying to be clever. Like all very fine dining places across the world, expect the consequent price tag. But we think it is worth it.
3
For a Pan-Pacific Property, the food was ordinary while naturally, the prices were not so! We were a group of 6 and the table and seating was somewhat cramped. Singapore has better Indian restaurants for sure
5
Went straight from the airport for a business dinner. Surprised to find such authentic north Indian food at Singapore. Their jaljeera, Phulkas and Gobi Mutter were so tasty as homemade without adding unnecessary masalas. So was the desert of fruit platter. Would love to go again with family
2
The food here is very expensive and definitely not worth the price. Dhal tarka was bland and so were most of the items on the buffet. Desserts were too sweet too. We decided to try out their food before booking the place for a private function and we are glad we did that as we would have wasted so much money on food that was not worth the price. The ambience was nice though and they have the nicest private dining room I have seen in a restaurant
4
Selected their buffet lunch as 1 of the seminar day lunch option.
Good food & service, recommended to try.
4
Enjoyable Indian food. Dim lighting and nice ambience. Feels like a W Hotel. Good for work trips or romantic dinner...
4
I recommend this restaurant if you are looking for exclusive fine Dining Indian Cuisine with an ethnic touch given to the menu. Some of the choices offered in the menu, you will not find anywhere lese. These guys are expensive but are good. For entertaining your Customers or guests, this is a good place to impress 
5
I came here for a dinner meeting with clients. As it was supposedly the best place for Indian food (as suggested by my S'pore office colleague), I agreed for it without having to search for any other option. In the end, I would say, my colleague was right. Although, my focus was on discussion throughout the meeting but I stopped in between to appreciate the taste and quality of food this place offered. I esp loved broccoli masala, butter chicken, Veg kebabs and Cinnamon panna cotta dessert. Mix that with a couple of glasses of Lagavulin and you will exit this place with a very happy mood. Service and Ambience too was great. Full marks for everything. Thanks Rang Mahal for a lovely dinner.
3
The price tag does not match the service nor the atmosphere unfortunately. I'm all for ambient lighting but this place is mean and moody with a maitre D' to match. It was the only restaurant within the hotel that lacked in most areas granted apart from the food. The food was super thankfully- but not a place I would recommend to anyone as it lacks massively in atmosphere
5
We wanted to experience a fine Indian dinner. After this I would say this is the place. Excellent a la carte selection. Nice environment. Food extremely tasty and finally we saw plating - hard to do usually with Indian food which contains a lot of gravy. Appetisers, main courses and deserts were very tasty. I would recommend to order more and share because the portions are big enough for 2 people to share.Place is also very clean, well decorated and service was excellent.For wine lovers the selection is also wide enough.Go and try it. No regret. We'll go back for sure.One think still important to mention, despite Indian places are usually value or mass, this place is not cheap for sure but it worth any penny.Enjoy
4
The restaurant has been renovated. Unlike Song of India and Tandoor, ventilation is good, and I didn't end up smelling. The tandoori chicken was nice, but the portion was large. The scallops were nicely presented but a bit overdone and tough. The chicken tikka masala was excellent. However there was not much sauce. The sea bass curry was saucy and not too spicy. It was very good too.Basmati rice was expensive, $18 for a large portion which two of us could not finish. Garlic naan was $10 for two big puffy pieces
5
One of my perennial favourites in Singapore. The dishes such as tikka murgh masala are expensive but generous enough to share. They have some great vegetarian options and will combine dishes to create whatever the customer wishes. The restaurant is always busy and the quality of both the food and service explains why. It's the only restaurant at the Pan Pacific not operated by the hotel.
5
I have been to Rang Mahal a fair few times, on personal and official dinners and I absolutely love the food. Gatte ki sabzi and Ragi roti are a must try. We had set meal on the latest official dinner and the variety in vegetarian set was good as well.Ambience is great, and service attentive and polite.Ridiculously expensive so save it for special occasions.
5
Difficult to imagine serving Indian food in a more upscale setting, but Rang Mahal has shown us that Indian food is as deserving linen napkins and white chinaware as any other cuisines. The interior was modern and elegant, incorporating traditional indian features such as vases and lighting ornaments. The menu sticked reasonably close to the classics of North Indian cuisine and the wine list was quite extensive. Speaking of which, the Indian red wine Sula is very nice and worth trying. The service was just as in any fine dining establishments - calm and polite, yet very friendly. We started with the amuse bouche and the basket of pappad with the selection of chutneys. We shared the mix of appetizers, which included chicken and fish tikka and lamb, and the latter was moist and aromatic. Between the courses we were offered a sorbet as a refresher or palette cleanser. We also shared curries: butter chicken, chicken massala and prawn curry along with rice mixed with Indian spices and also naan bread. One of the reasons why the food was so flavorful is probably due to the fact that they import all their spices and ingredients from India, which I know makes a huge difference. Most of the reviews stated their dissatisfaction with the prices, which is really quite frustrating when you receive such a HUGE bill by the end of the dinner. Nevertheless, you don't just pay for food that was cooked with high quality products, but also for the atmosphere, the service, the ambience and, heck, the A/C too! So still comparing prices with Europe, it is still worth trying this restaurant - a traditional Indian in a more contemporary setting.

I went with an Indian colleague who is vegetarian to Rang Mahal and we both enjoyed it. We split a Veg apetizer which was excellent. My Kadhai prawns were fresh with an excellent sauce and nicely spicy.
Great and very responsive service.
1
The title sums up my feeling. As an Indian, I am offended that anyone can charge such ridiculous amounts. Biryani 54 dollars; seriously? Just because the restaurant is in a 5 star hotel does not give you the right to take the "Mickey"!
Avoid.
5
We celebrated our son's first birthday here as this is one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore . The service has always been outstanding and food is by far one of the best in Singapore ! Truly an excellent fine dining experience .
5
Excellent service and quality. I recommend a salmon tandoori,it is rated as an appetizer by it is a proper entree on its size! Do not miss the butter nan. The coffee kulfi is excellent.
5
Rang Mahal offers a good variety of North Indian food with very friendly staff and offers very good service. Food taste was excellent and do not forget a bite of Dessert of your choice after the meal!
1
In a city like Singapore where there is no lack of fine dining options, this place is to be stayed far away from.Reasons-Zero views of the city. Its like you're sitting in a cabin.Pricing is just unbelievable (only catering to corporates who don't look at price charts)You would find better Indian food in street restaurants in Clarke Quay. Lack of flavour and off the mill dishes
3
Its located at Pan Pacific hotel, ambience is ok and servers are prompt and polite. Prices are on much higher side but close to being ridiculous even from a 5 star standards.We ordered chicken dish, house special Dal, Alu-Methi Veggie and Tandoori Roti. It was surprisingly tasty, not overly spiced.While ordering I asked server for a cake and candle (Add to our bill) but looks like waiter was not interested or forgot request. Rest was ok. We only went there as I wanted my guests to show the place. Unless there is a lunch or dinner deal, its not worth going there considering prices
1
We were staying at the Pan Pacific and decided to try the Rang Mahal. Looked at the menu and could not believe the roomali roti was $16. This is the most expensive bread in the world. Looked at the rest of the menu - $54 for a biryani - that is just crazy. Paid for drinks and left. In a city with amazing Indian restaurants in Little India this is just outrageous. Bananas Leaf Apollo or Curry Culture next visit..:

Had visited this restaurant in Singapore during my visit for lunch. The buffet spread was excellent, but we preferred to be served with the plate lunch option. The food was very good and the portions also quite nice. The service staff who attended was good and very courteous. The huge imposing god statue at the entrance was captivating
4
Rang Mahal wins awards for its ambience and authentic cuisine. It's restaurant has a pretty layout and it is best to make reservations as they can be busy. They have a well laid out menu allowing patrons to choose from freshly made bread, curries, and minced meat items. The lassi drinks are also popular. Service is thoughtful and you can be assured of privacy in this restaurant. Recommended for special events
5
We had dinner hear with friends. A great night with excellent service and food. Authentic Indian dishes and a huge variety to choose from.
A good selection of wines and some amazing desserts.
Definately worth a visit.
4
Rang mahal has decent food and service. The variety in starters was good - and enough vegetarian choice in the mains as well .
Service was attentive and tables spaced out well enough not to be intrusive
Overall a good buffet
5
Had my hubby bday dinner here..very quite and soothing place to relax after a hectic work day..we ordered goat cheese and potato tikki as a starter which was very nicely roasted and filling with some drinks..the quantity here is great for 3 people per starter..for main course u cant miss there palak paneer with garlic naan which is super soft and tasty..gatte ki sabji was nice but not outstanding..to end our evening they celebrated bday with a cute heart shaped began barfi cake which was complimentary.thumps up for the ambicence too
2
Great ambience and décor, but understaffed which makes the service slow on a Saturday night. The good part was the chicken tikka and the rotis, but iff you cannot gett that right as an Indian restaurant then you better close shop. The artichoke pakora was tough and fibrous, the dal was average, the tulsi paneer seekh was sweet and the mix vegetable dish was a disaster. no value for money but good to impress a business client who knows little of Indian food
5
I have been coming to Rang Mahal on and off for about 10 years, and it has never disappointed me. On this last visit the food was extraordinary. The decor is hushed and modern, the service extremely attentive, and the flavours were magnificent. Try the Kerala fish curry with coconut milk, it is excellent. I look forward to my next visit.
3
This place serves good Indian food; they also have a live chappati counter which they setup next to your table serving fresh chappati’s. Recommended for fine dining Indian food
5
I had lunch here with two of my colleagues - the food was great. There was a great variety of items to choose from, with ample vegetarian options. The deserts were exceptionally good with options of north and south indian sweets as well as your standard fruit platters. The food was not too spicy, which really impressed my Singaporean colleague. What stood out for me was the service; the staff were extremely attentive without being intrusive
4
The food here was delicious, though in keeping with the fine dining style was smaller in portion size. There was some not-so-successful combinations that was little "try too hard" (i.e. an amuse bouche of papaya in honey water + crunchy dhall fritter + coconut water) - but overall nice fancy option for impressing guests
5
This is by far one of the finest Indian restaurants I've dine in, recommended by a friend and went there twice over a 5 days trip in Singapore.Food is superb and the service is excellent. don't miss this place
4
Went there with my parents for dinner. We ordered their 2 course meals and dahi mirchi, lasuni palak paneer, peeli daal, missi roti, garlic naan and non veg appetisers. Loved the food. I am very particular when it comes to palak paneer. And I must say I loved it. Their thali is good for one person. Everything tasted really nice. The staff was extremely courteous. I would definitely recommend it
5
Definetely I will recommend to all my Dubai Friends. I will share my experience and the food I had, This was my excellent experience outside Dubai
3
The private room is pretty good as it can accommodate 20-25 people. The AV facilities are okay. The food is good. Bhindi, kadhi, paneer, kulfi are all very good. Great Indian good experience outside India.
5
- Great ambience and attentive service without intrusion
- Delicious kebabs and curries, but their biryani stood out. One of the best in Sg.
- Jalebi and rabdi are a must-try; truly amazing and very well recommended.
5
We had a truly outstanding dinner. From wine to entreÃ© to accompaniments. Staff extremely attentive and entertaining. We also thought the decor was very nice. I had the lamb vindaloo, and it was exceptional.
4
Rarely do I eat Indian food outside India, This time I did. Being vegetarian I was unsure but good interesting and different menu. Tulsi Kebab. Dahi Mirchi. Kadhai Paneer. All very good. Yellow Dal goo
5
Visited Rang Mahal for a business lunch. First thing that struck me was the ambience. Just blends into the theme. Then got blown away by the food. To start with, deliciously soft dollars. Authentic to the core. Appreciate their service in bringing this to the table even though it was a buffet. Rest of the starters were equally good - samosa, aloo tukra and the chutneys. Then the main course - even as a vegetarian, I was spoilt for choices. The paneer makhni was soft and succulent. The dal rajasthani was aptly cooked and I'm saying this particularly because so many restaurants get it wrong on the paneer and the dal - burnt out, paneer that tastes like rubber. The butter naan bread was, again, just right. Jeera Kesar pulao tasted like heaven and went just absolutely well with the boondi ki raita and the dal. My colleague thoroughly enjoyed the chicken tikka, the fish and the lamb biryani. Masala chai was just perfetto for my colleague to finish it off. I went for the spongy Kesar rasgulla - again they did not let us down at all. Best of all, Ahmed, who helped us was the most courteous staff I've ever seen. Cannot forget his signature smile. Will definitely come back for more lunches here
4
Four of us visited this restaurant during Feb 2016. We ordered drinks, appetisers and 3 course meal. Wine, champagne, appetisers and desserts were excellent, but the vegetarian Indian food was disappointing. The ambience and service were excellent.Bill came to S$700 for four persons. Recommend one visit, if you wish to dine in a very fine place
3
I visited Rang Mahal for lunch on Jan 16th for lunch with my wife. The restaurant has an a-la-carte menu for weekend lunch and offers a buffet for weekdays. The service at the restaurant is impeccable. However, the food did not meet the standards that you would expect from a fine dining restaurant like Rang Mahal. We ordered Lamb, Dal and Naan. The lab was undercooked and the dal tasted average. Overall, due to the average and overpriced food I am going to give this restaurant a miss
5
Rang Mahal is one of the best dining Indian Restaurants in Singapore . It has very nice Interior Decor with very good setting. They have some modified menu. One of them was Artichoke Fritters. It was the most delicious fritters we have ever enjoyed. Overall it was a wonderful experience
5
For me, this was the best Indian fine dining available in Singapore. Goes without saying it is expensive but you pay for the ambience, setting, food and service. The lunch buffet is a must-eat thing for foodies loving Indian food. All there chefs are Indians which makes the serving very authentic
4
Service and ambience is good
Not a wide range of dishes but still an excellent spread especially during occasions like Diwali
3
the Atmonsphere is nice, the service is good, but the food is neither haute nor perfectly Indian to justify the prices.
Chefs are not up to scratch ....and come up with very average fare.
4
The food was good, although the choices were limited. No really fiery dishes as vindaloos. Lights are perhaps a bit dim.
La comida buena, pero sin ser realmente picante. La iluminación un poco escasa.
5
This was my Second visit in your Restaurant.Good Experience again.I would Like to say Thanks to staff who maintain the service standred, Food was outstanding and service also great and fast. I order as a main course murg,fish,prawn curry and bread with lamb kabab. main thing is the Dishes were Presented very nice. as per my experience it's one of the top most Restaurant in Singapore
5
This restaurant had very good ambience and courteous staff. The choice of dishes from North India was good. The dishes were well presented and food was tasty with right level of spices. Unfortunately there are very few good Indian restaurants in Singapore and this is one of them
5
Ambience is really nice, has a nice dim romantic setting, good for birthdays and valentines etc. Food is also really good. From the appetizers to the main course was perfect. Cost was super pricey thou. For the food I would say you can get better outside at half the price. Paying mostly for the name and the ambience. But has very good vegetarian food
3
Very stylish inferior but for me too cold atmosphere and much too dark….but good service. I ordered a vegetarian dish Aloo Gobi and then lamb biriani - the food was good but far to expensive. If you just want to get real authentic Indian food, there are much cheaper ways e.g. some Hawker Food Places like Newton….
5
Visiting my son's family in Singapore as I was, my son chose Rang Mahal for my birthday dinner as he wanted it to be special & how very right he was! In classy setting the restaurant in the renovated Pan Pacific Hotel dished out tasty Indian fare from Starters to Dessert! For Starters we chose Paneer Tikka & Aloo Tukre, followed by the Main Course of Aam chur bhindi, Paneer Makhani & Yellow Dal with Rotis of different kinds like Roomali Roti, Garlic Naan & Tandoori Roti. Dessert was of course Chocolate cake as my birthday cake which was yummy beyond words! The service was courteous though a shade slow. The ambience was classy and we saw several tables serving guests from all across the world including Japan, Europe & Russia. It was a great evening all told
4
Beautiful interior (although may be a bit cold) and great service. We ordered a vegetarian sampler appetizer and then lamb biriani and chicken dish and 2 drinks and the price was about 250 spd. Should have gone to hawker station and would have gotten just as tasty of a meal (although no service of course). Would recommend for a special occasion but if you just want to get authentic Indian food, there are much cheaper ways
2
Apalling service - no maitre d at front desk to meet and greet guests and bring them to their reserved tables. We walked in and stood awkwardly inside the dining hall waiting for someone we can ask or to notice us so we can be seated. Eventually a grumpy waiter walked over to us - clearly annoyed that he had to make the effort. Hastily asked how many we were and pointed to a table with enough chairs and then walked away. Excellent! So we pull out our own heavy chairs - wait a bit more until another waiter strolls over to give drinks menu. Then wait for another 20min after ordering our simple martinis and wine to be served.Food is average and overpriced - the amouse bouche is yesterday's old stale bread served with a horid red toxic concoction of some kind. Waiters walk around like you owe them a favour for serving you - they are detached and just want their shift to be over - why did they even bother coming to work
5
We had a great experience, the food was delicious, the staff was super friendly, I highly recommend this restaurant for business, family and couples.
5
Although considered very expensive if you just want your usual butter chicken-fix, the quality is definitely amongst the highest for modern Indian food in Singapore.
5
If you want to experience Indian dining at its best then Rang Mahal is the place to go. Great Decor, Superb Food and Exquisite presentation would blow you away! Chef Well Done!
1
Expensive food.
Quality is good.
Ambience - nice.
But pretty bad Waiters and Waitresses. They have attitude and have a short term memory problem.
Need to improve on this front.
Take your chance.
5
this restaurant is truly one of the best restaurants I have been to. This place is great for special occasion and high class Indian food.. The food is the best I tried in Singapore.
The surroundings are pretty majestic and glamarious...
3
I have been to the Rang Mahal on a regular basis. The restaurant has been taken upscale mostly by increasing prices but the ambiance stays that of an average restaurant. The service is also lacking and it took long to serve and the serving was not coordinated. The food taste is that of any regular Indian restaurant
5
Not my first time in this restaurant but still love it. About taste there will Always be different opinions but i have been in quite a few Indian restaurants and i have to say this is one of the best i visited so far. The food is fresh, quality ingredients and well prepared. I also tried the salmon and i can only say it was perfectly cooked, delicious and an eye catcher. Main dishes are great, desserts lovely, good winelist. Never had any problem with the staff, they are accurate, paying attention and doing their job. Prices maybe bit high but quality has it price. Certainly will recommend this restaurant
5
This is no slum meal! It is high class Indian at its best. It has to be the best Indian Restaurant in Singapore? The menu is varied, but not huge. The wines are thoughtfully chosen, but very expensive. Try the Cape Mentelle Shiraz, one of the cheapest and one of the best matched with spicy food, from Margaret River, WA. The plain roti is a great accompaniment. Try the cauliflower, spicy and healthy; and the lamb biryani. Delicious, tasteful, and stylish - but take your credit card
1
We found the food to be of very average quality, at or below an average food court (and many food courts have better). The salmon was under cooked and almost tasteless. The Dahl was also very plain in flavour, not very "Indian". Finally the signature chicken dish had small, unrecognisable pieces, nice sauce texture but poor flavour. The price for two was extortionate. $32 for the Dahl, $50 for the Salmon starter, $48 for the chicken main. Water... $9 for 500 ml. There are MUCH better places elsewhere.
3
Was told it had great food selection. I found it rather plain. Curries were not to die for....deserts and starters were better. Service efficient but need to increase the number of seasoned waiters. .. for a large function may not be ideal due to the layout of the room so perhaps better for smaller groups.
5
Truly exquisite and delicious Indian food and the service was spot on in a calm, serene environment. Could not fault it in any way. A delightful find. Would have gone back again had it not been my last night!
4
Went to the Rang for dinner and it truly is a five star restaurant with good Indian Food. Pricey but still good food. Is it the best Indian ever? Well no. I have had better in other restaurants on this fabulous island. However, it does stand aside as a classy place to take your dinner date. We have lamb vindhaloo, and dhall and Chicken. Good Indian tucker. The staff were attentive and courteous. The wine list was extensive. Thus is you are looking for a special Indian to bring someone to then this is it. Just remember that you will get better Indian tucker elsewhere in Serangoon Road
5
This is one of my favorite retaurants for indian vegetarian food . The ambience is very nicely done .chef is very good .he will do the needful when requested . The food is delicious . The desserts are fantastic . Nice place to bring your family and clients

I came here with a group of colleagues from work so we had a private dining area and a set menu.Service was excellentI thought that the food was well balanced both in portion sizes and the flavour combinations. I found it interesting that some of our American colleagues thought that the food was spicy but to be fair I don't think they have a wide set of culinary experiences outside of the US. The wines served were also very good
2
A colleague and I ate at Rang Mahal as I was staying in the hotel. Every step of the way, from the initial drinks order to receive the bill we had very long waits and absent & inattentive staff, interspersed with half decent food. Although the manager did remove the service charge after I complained, like the service overall it was reluctant and under duress. It's a shame as the food is almost worth the visit, but the overall experience doesn't justify the very high price

I visited this restaurant after a 10 mins walk as the nearby roads were closed due to grand prix.The food was worth the long walk.the menu was elaborate and the service was quick.The restaurant had a spectacular view. On one side I could see Hotel Marina bay sands and on the other side was Singapore flyer.Overall a wonderful experience
5
Was here a couple of years ago and I though it was better on that occasion. This time around, the restaurant was rather quite and it was a mediocre experience. The food was good, service somewhat complacent and the feel of laise affair. Probably there are many new and trendier Indian restaurants in Singapore now so perhaps Rang Mahal in the Pan Pacific complex has lost its glitter.

Was at Rang Mahal for dinner with a business associate. Ordered simple - dal rang Mahal and bhindi amchuri. All fine - nothing striking. All very ordinary and that was a disappointment.There was a fly hovering on the table. Was politely suggested to change the table as there are fruitflies. Not to be expected in upmarket restaurant in 5 star property in Singapore.Ordered Masala tea - found it to be cold and too milky. Asked for change and got it but in the process far from being the right value for the money..

We were four of us . We recommended the lamb. This was uncooked and blood was oozing out. Shocking . I could not even swallow it. The Chicken tikka was OK.For main course we ordered Palak Paneer ( There was hardly and Paneer and it crumbled)The Baingan Bartha had nor flavour and it was absolute rubbish.We ordered a wine( which is about S $ 20/- landed) they were selling it for S $ 110/-Over Priced , Over Rated and absolutely shocking food. Will never recommend Rang Mahal to anyone.Some of the ordinary restaurants give better quality and value for foo

We just finished our lunch buffet at rang mahal and were quite disappointed specially with the main course items. For vegetarians there was an extremely dipped in oil brinjal Preparation an oily Bhindi ki sabji and a watery dal the paneer matar was sweet and the peas were not even fully cooked. Service was quite decent. The chat items were quite good the saving grace. Not worth it for vegetarians

Recommended by concierge at Fullerton Bay Hotel. Probably the best Indian food in Singapore, if a little expensive. Certainly great to experience great food at a new place after living here for 5 years! Portions are meant to be shared!
4
Nice setting, have been to this place many times. Good Indian buffet for lunch, reasonable choices, . Reasonable upscale price, valet parking available. Good for business, family and friends.
5
Great value for the lunch buffet. The food keeps on coming. He service is excellent and this is some of the best Indian food outside of India.
5
This restaurant is in Pan Pacific hotel and its probably one of the best Indian restaurants in Singapore. Staff is friendly, accurate, paying attention. You get quality food on star level. Ofcourse you pay bit more but its worth it. A must for a foodlover.
4
The food is incredible! Very good with huge portions! The problem is that the food took a lot of time to be served knowing that it was not crowded at all when we visited. This is not a big problem when the food is that tasty! I loved i

Indian traditional food of utmost quality. Must try their lunch buffet.Lunch buffet has wide variety of good traditional indian food. Live dosa station, veg and non veg starters, so many main course veg-non veg food, biryani, indian desserts, masala chai etc...Nice decor. There is enough space between tables so,you have your privacy. friendly and attentive staff. Quick in clearing plates.everything tastes super good like, chaat, dosas, dhokla, prawns, bengali fish curry, gatta curry, lamb biryani (yummm biryani), rabri, jalebi and much much more... Five star quality service and food.Highly recommend their lunch buffet
5
Often an indian meal can be good but not outstanding - this was simply brilliantThe service is impeccable, the wine list extensive to meet all prices and tastesThe chef taster to start, the popadoms, the lamb dish that melted in the mouth and garlic naan that danced on the taste budsThere is no wonder this resteraunt has won so many awardsThis is North Indian food at its very very bestMy mouth is watering thinking about it - a really wonderful mea

This restaurant serves dishes with Indian names but not Indian flavour. I went here yesterday night with my husband for dinner, we ordered non-veg platter, butter chicken and two breads. The bill was 144 SGD (without drinks), highly overpriced considering none of the dishes had any flavour, while clearing the table the staff asked if there was any problem in the chicken dish because we hardly ate anyI responded that it wasn't good but he never apologised or said anything. Simply ignored as if I never said something. The only good part was some small fillers they gave between meals; example coconut water and steamed cake on welcome, sorbet after starters and small piece of dessert in the end. But I am certain that I will not revisit this restaurant
3
Used to enjoy eating at Rang Mahal. Last trip not so good. The food was not exciting. For the buffet, the food was sparse - most probably, the restaurant did not expect many guests. The chef for the Doshi station had disappeared. Nan used to be offered continuously. The time, offered only once. Even after asking four times, no sign of the nan. They finally arrived when I had finished my food. No apology from the management. For the price they charge, definitely not worth it
4
Visited the Rang Mahal restaurant at the Pan Pacific Hotel in downtown Singapore. The ambience and decor was excellent. The Indian vegetarian food that was ordered was authentic and well done. The appetisers was truly of high quality. The deserts served were tasty and no presented in style. The place must be visited by food lovers visiting Singapore.
5
New decor and ambience really improves the overall experience. Have been a regular since 2007, and is still has the best Indian food in Singapore. Miss the old open kitchen and the mingling with the chef and all, but a great place to have lunch.
4
1 of the best Indian cuisine i ever had, have always recommend people to go RM for Indian cuisine.
Nice decor, quiet and great food!
3
Went to this landmark restaurent for a meal with family. Very classy place and a good buffet. Service was the highlight as a waiter was always around to cater to you. Food was good ... Nothing extraordinary. Very very expensive and poor value for money.
5
The food was wonderful, my top 5 Indian restaurants world wide!
Got the most tasty chicken tikka masala, in a long time!

Had dinner here one night when in Singapore. I enjoy Indian food and always eat it abroad when I travel (- except when in India my colleagues insisted on a Chinese).This restaurant is pretty good - not as good as Benares in London but certainly in my top three. The portions were individually allocated to small insets on a large glass dish, unlike the usual Indian where everything comes separately and you then put it on the plate.Service was very good and attentive.Food was also very good with two minor areas for improvement. The chicken starter was not breast of chicken and I have a dislike of any parts of chicken that are not 'dry' so I was prejudiced against this - personal issue. Other point was that the portions were rather small - health wise this is good as I intend to eat too much anyway and what I got was adequate, but I would still have liked more!Overall bill for 2 courses with 1 beer was about S€140, so not cheap, but worth it for the experience

During my visit last week to Singapore, I happened to dine there with family. Even though, it was a busy night I was accommodated in a cushy table. The food we ordered was, lobster, Biryani, Paneer Makhani, Sheek Kabab, phulka, Anjeer kulfi dessert and Gulab Jamoon etc. The taste of each of these items is still lingering in my mouth and each one of us enjoyed the food. My grand daughters enjoyed the Paneer and gravy very much. The atmosphere was serene and service with smile and promptness was appreciable. It is one of the top class Restaurant , both quality wise and price wise, in Singapore. A casual visit with your family for fine dining will be enjoyable and appetising
2
Dined in here last week and got a surprise out of it. Had seekh kebab, 2 main dishes consist of 1 vege and 1 non vege,1 naan and 1 rice. Cost me at $200. That's too expensive with the quality of the naan which I've tasted better, and watery butter chicken. I admit the service was really good. It's up to standard though they have forgotten to change the dinner fork and knife but that's not what bothers me. Well cause I expected- good service means good food. Good food means good price. Not so good food isn't what I am expecting. So 5 for service, 2 for food. Poor for price.Really, go somewhere else if you want good food, there's really a lot of better restaurant with good food at cheaper price. Really disappointed.

Make no mistake, this is one of the high-end, high quality, richly-decked fine dining Indian Restaurants in Singapore, nestled inside the grand Pan Pacific Hotel.However, the feeling I got after visiting this place was that it should be taking its place among Singapore's Top Restaurants with an impeccable reputation, but this place comes short on food. Ambience is great, the ideas are brilliant, the choice of dishes is brilliant, but execution leaves you shaking your head with the phrase "Lost Opportunity" on top of your mind. I guess its current ranking on Tripadvisor is way below where one would expect it to be, but if you dig deeper it's not difficult to understand why.First the good part- excellent choice of dishes, especially Dahi ke Kebab, Achari Gosht and Blueberry Shrikhand. These were brilliantly conceptualized and executed, and you yearn for more all the time! Other must try dishes- Rose Syrup falooda & Rabdi, Jalebi and Chocolate Brownie.But as you go along the not-so-good side showed itself. Here's how:The Cut fruit salad had unmistakably stale fruit mixed with fresh ones- unpardonable for a restaurant of this reputation. Moreover, several dishes in Chicken, fish, dry vegetables were ‘not there” in terms of taste. You’d probably understand this better if you’ve been to places like Bukhara in Delhi or Yantra or Punjab Grill in Singapore; the mix of spices and flavours was missing in many.All-in-all, IMHO it is an almost-very good place which has some way to go before it can be top-notch. I am not sure whether this place has gone down recently; I have only stayed in Singapore for 5 months as of date and have visited this place a couple of times (second time was to check whether my first visit was an aberration, but alas!), but have tried many many eateries in Singapore since to arrive at this conclusion
4
We went to this restaurant for a work lunch as it has a lunchtime buffet and we wanted to get in and out of the restaurant quickly. The service was very good and efficient. The food was good. It's a bit pricey for lunch however. The restaurant was renovated a few years back so isn't quite as formal as it used to be but nevertheless is good for a more formal lunch or dimmer
5
Dining at Rang Mahal was a great experience, it was a little taste of India in the heart of Singapore. Service was great and the upscale ambiance really created the perfect atmosphere for a dinner with friends or family. Rang Mahal is definitely an exceptional blend of traditional Indian heritage in its food with the contemporary feel of its elegant setting
5
The food itself is very keeping of traditional Indian food of the utmost quality. The restaurant is beautiful, blending in Indian aesthetics with a contemporary spin. With an attentive staff, the overall experience was a memorable!
3
Visited yesterday with a friend. Just one starter, two main courses and some soft drinks. Costed over $100/head. Way overpriced. Taste, ambience and service is also good but there is much better value elsewhere
4
One of our associate law firm in Sinagpore treated us at Rang Mahal, Singapore during our visit in November, 2013. They ordered North Indian thali for us, it was good meal, but restaurant is very pricey.
4
Went with a business group. Nice surroundings and they took very good care of my allergies. Prepared lovely gluten free choices. Food quality was high. Service level respectable. Nice evening overall. I would go back.
4
The taste was truly Indian and service was excellent ,but the price was very high compared to other Indian Restaurant in the near by location.We had taken buffet lunch during our recent visit , and menu was good both for non-veg as wel for veg.
5
This was our third visit to this restaurant and it did not disappoint. Great service and all the food we had was excellent as always. We all commented that the lamb chops were the best tasting we had ever had. It is expensive but it is worth every penny. If I could take this restaurant back to Manchester I would
4
had decided on Indian food for the birthday dinner of my husband. Got the rang mahal restaurant recommended and I can say the food was excellent. As the price is pretty steep I had expected better service(they put an Evian small plastic bottle on your table...felt cheap) and the ambience isn't very cosy, but again the food was excellent.
4
Went there for a dinner with friends. Appreciated the chef came out to ask us for the special order we wanted. Environment is great and food of very high quality. Probably a bit expensive for Indian food but I realise Singapore prices have gone up quite substantially recently.Anyway a great experience for a budget
4
The setting with high ceiling and cosy lighting. Menu selection is comprehensive for both vegetarian and none. Many creative and innovative while maintaining authentic of Northern cuisine. Service was efficient but could have been better in advising guests as we ordered too many dishes due to slightly big portion size. All in all, it was excellent dinner
4
Was here to celebrate my parents 25th Anniversary and the food here was pretty good. Perhaps the best thing about the place was the great ambience and the wonderful view of the Singapore skyline. Not your regular go to place because of the prices and location but definitely a place to go when you are looking to celebrat
5
Restaurant was able to accommodate vegan diners with no notice. All the dishes were very good. Décor was calm and relaxing, although it can be noisy when full. Staff was very attentive but not hovering.
4
A place for indian food. All sorts, varieties, taste and full of spices. Both veg and non-veg. Gives a feel of India.
5
Most expensive curry I have ever had
Was really tasty and service excellent
Wine very costly, great surroundings and nice staff
4
The food quality and ambience is very good. The staff are very professional and attentive to your needs. Everything about this restaurant is good except for the pricing. One can expect a minimum of $100 per person.
4
It's well decorated, very calm and realxing environment. The staffs are very friendly and attentive. The food was excellent. We love the panner tikka and Ghatigi Subzi. The vegetarin food options are plenty. Even though price wise at high end but with family once in while worth visiting
3
Set in Pan Pacific, Rang Mahal has a great ambience. Would be good to bring your date for a nice romantic meal. The food lacked certain flavor - perhaps because we had two Caucasians wish us, they cut down on the spices and additional flavoring! May try next time with a desi crowd
4
The entire dinning experience was great. The chicken and fish items were super!! Good service and lots of items to choose from the menu. The staff was very pleasant and attentive. The starters were absolutely fantastic, though I found them a little pricey!! The deserts were great and good value for money
3
Initially when we were ordering we thought everything on the menu was pricey. But when the food came we found that the portion sizes were substantial for a family of 2 adults and 1 kid. We were disappointed with the breads, particularly the roomali roti whose size was so small that it put me off. For the price I thought the quality of breads was not justified. Ambience was a little to dark, not the kind of place I would want to go too often
1
It is not often that I leave a restaurant feeling totally ripped-off. I have eaten in MIchelin star restaurants across the globe, but by comparison the exorbitant prices charged in this restaurant for this quality food, border on rapacious. After being asked if we wanted "still or sparkling", my table (4) had 4 small bottles of Evian water plonked in front of each us - the cost with added 10% service and local tax (++) - $50 !! I could have walked next door and buy each bottle for $1.50. My son and I each had a bottle of local Tiger beer, the cheapest on the menu - cost $12++ each. My wife and son's fiance both ordered the cheapest white wine as served by the glass - $28++ each with definite sparing of wine being poured. Now for the food. We shared two appetizers and four smallish servings of quite average Indian food @ $40++ per serve. A bowl of RICE -$16++. Naan bread $20++ per serve. TOTAL $400 !!Overall the ambience is OK, the staff are nice, and the food is acceptable BUT the prices are way beyond providing any sense of value for money. Unless you have excess cash you want to needlessly burn, I recommend you avoid this place. In such a situation, better value at the Casino
4
Fantastic food, decent choice...the front lady was not very keen it seems to welcome guest saying the place is full,( while very visibly it was not!) when I insisted that we are hotel guest, an Indian hospitality staff make sure we get a place and served well....
5
The food was of better quality when compared to food quality you get in India.
By far the best Indian restaurant in Singapore... Pan Pacific
4
I visited this restaurant whilst staying at the hotel. My three course meal cost over $100 for one person. The food was very good but it wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good but I'd expect so at that price.
5
I love Indian food and so had to visit it again. Former experience here was perfect and it was same feeling i had this time. The food is lovely, high quality and served on star level. Loved it and prices are reasonable.
5
Great food
Great service
Great Ambiance
Fantastic overall experience!!
Singapore has a lot to offer but this is right there in the top 5!!
4
Food is very good, but a bit expensive. Decor, seating etc is very nice. This is located on 3rd level inside Pan Pacific hotel and I found it a bit difficult to locate and understand that this was within the Pan Pacific hotel.
1
My partner and I made the mistake of dining here during a stay at the Pan Pacific. The food and drinks were ridiculously priced but we thought we would treat ourselves - plus, I don't mind paying for top quality! Unfortunately there was really nothing quality about the food or drinks here. A bowl of steamed rice even cost $15 AUD. We had two dishes, naan, steamed rice two rounds of drink and one dessert and the price was over $200 AUD. It all tasted very average.The staff hovered over us while we ate and we couldn't get comfortable. It is such a shame for the hotel because the other restaurants inside ARE top quality. We won't be back
4
The menu and service here is very good in comparison to the other places I have eaten in Singapore. I had tandoori lobster for my main course, as I really wanted fish and the other fish dishes didn't appeal to me. It was good but I left most of the pilau rice as the portion was quite big. My guest was a vegetarian and I felt sorry for him as the choices on the menu didn't look that great. However, as he had suggested the restaurant to me I didn't say anything to him. Nice to go here once, but having been there once I see no reason to go back again
3
One member of our party of four asked for very mildly spiced food. Unfortunately his meal was raging hot, probably hotter than the other dishes served. The service was very attentive. We eat Indian cuisine often but this was too highly spiced which masked the real tast of the meal
4
My wife and I went to Rang Mahal on the 6th October 2014, the restaurant has a lovely atmosphere with beautiful decor and lighting. My wife had a frozen Lime Margarita which she enjoyed very much. We had the Non Vegetarian Platter for our starter which included Tandoori Salmon, Seekh Kebab and Chicken Tikka. This was well cooked and spiced.We then had a palette cleanser of Dokra and coconut which was delicious.For our mains we had Aloo Jeera and Murgh Masala Chicken with Naans. Both of which were good. I was surprised that a restaurant of this standard did not use chicken breast in their dishes.We had lemon sorbet as another palette cleanser which was very nice.For dessert I had my personal favourite of Rasmalai which was served in a glass, this is a simple dessert and was delicious.An example of how expensive this restaurant was: Diet Coke was SGP$10 and my "plastic" bottle of Evian was SGP$9. I would expect a glass bottle in still water for a upmarket eatery like this. Our non veg platter was SGP$52.Our experience at Rang Mahal was very good and this is a great place to have romantic meal but the food is not the very best I have tasted for the price. Portion sizes were small and whilst the food and service was good it is in my opinion too expensive. For this price I would expect a higher calibre of food.
4
I have been a fan of Rang Mahal since its Imperial days. It has become more posh lately. Service was good. The food was great; good quality fine dining. We had the set dinners. Portions look small at first glance but was adequately substantial. Dessert portions were generous
4
A great choice , delicious food , not so cheap but served by freat staff , the menu has an excellent selection , nice staff .
2
Heard about this rest quite a few time !
I think the buffet was not worth very average food ! Even though the service was quite poor !!
The ambience of rest was amazing
But over all expierence was not good !
5
On a lunch buffet. Choices were ample and staff always offer additional food. Loves the variety of curry they offer.
5
If you want to taste something Indian in Singapore this the place to be - awesome taste! I had it during my stay at Pan Pacific and I didnot expect such an authentic taste - but I was pleasantly surpised.
5
Also situated in the Pan Pacific hotel and its definatly worth a visit. Food is tasty, fresh, really star level..staff is very friendly and helpfull when you ask something. Maybe not that cheap but be sure its not wasted money.
2
been visiting this restaurant for many years going back to the river valley days. Always thought this was the creme de la creme of north indian restaurants here. That view just changed last night.How do i start? nice ambience, friendly and smiling staff, nice decor, check all these peripherals. Uncheck all the rest - food quality, pricing and overall impression. I suppose we can forgive all else if food quality is great. This restaurant seriously needs to re-assess its cuisine and its chefs if it aims to be the best in town. The roomali roti was pre-prepared and raw in most part, the nans were the worst i have ever eaten, an absolute embarrassment to Indian cuisine. one did not tear the naans, one broke them like biscuits. The tandoori chicken has strange spices and was too wet, the paani puri puris tasted like bought from a store - they were hard and lacked the right filling. The okra was ok - i would not fault it but would not gush over it, just pass. The rara gosht is meant to be an extreme expression of the art of north indian cooking, punjabi style. This tasted more bengali rather than pukka. Slightly sweet, i wonder if sugar was added. The arhar dal was poor, insufficiently cooked and with the water separating from the dal , how on earth can you go wrong with dal? Palak paneer was an embarrassment - unnaturally green and lacking the proper spices sans ginger julienne. Wine menu- very goodoverall- terrrible night, i apologized to my 3 guests several times on behalf of this restaurant so they, in turn, dont need to apologize to me.Just fix your issues or stop charging these price
5
Easily one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. The staff was very friendly and to my surprise had a birthday surprise waiting for me at the end of the night.Must try for meat lovers - the lamb chops! ~ simply to die forFor vegetarians - the palak paneer is one of the best I've hadI'm definitely visiting this restaurant again
5
As the name states, Fine Dining, its really a fine dining restaurant in Singapore. Pan Pacific ,itself an icon in Singapore, the entrance to this hotel is awesome. With the traditional welcome by the Vinayaka Statue, they have the regular seating and there is separate room for the party seating also. Party seating is with around 18 seater.. We went the Ala carte.. with the Tomata Soup, Aloo Chat, all time favourite Paani poori's.. the Quality of the pani poori was excellent, even the kids had.. Infact we were more into the starters, were thinking whether to order main course or not:)... From the main course, jumped directly to the Hyd Biryani rice. Overall the taste of each item was good and delicious. and worth going again
2
Not the best Indian food I ever had, and certainly not the worst..sort of average. But definitely the most expensive. How 3 people got to 350sgd sharing 1 appetizer and 2 main courses with minimal alcohol is astounding. Service is overly attentive..few customers so staff stands around ready to fill your water glass the minute you take a sip. Not for me
5
Rang mahal not only is one of the best restaurant in the city , it also boosts of one of superb service also. The ambience is slightly subdued and could have been better but its food which scores superb points in this restaurant. I am vegetarian and so ordered samosa which was as good as it gets in India. Paneer Tikka was soft and detectable. We ordered Dal Makhni, Paneer and Jodhpuri Gatta Curry which was all too good
5
Exquisite Indian cuisine for special occasions specialising in both signature and vegetarian options. Expensive but enjoyable.
5
Probably the best Indian meal I have had outside of India ...gorgeous restaurant but extraordinarily expensive 300 sgd for 2 courses for 2 with 2 glasses of house wine. Try the lamb main dish ..epic
3
Good Place ..Good place , lot of options .I really enjoy visiting this place for lunch.The staff is very well trained to take care of the guests .
4
I keep coming back for the Tandoori Lobster - and this time seemed a very big one. Something unique and tasty in the way they do this.The rest of the dishes are good, I enjoy the Murgh marsala and also their channa dish. Though you can cheaper options elsewhere which are equally good, you dont get to try the lobster !The house chilean merlt was not the best wine Ive had
3
This restaurant is a little difficult to appraise as there are more issues than simply the quality of the food, staff and the ambiance of the restaurant. The ambiance is superb; the views from the 26 floor just magic, especially at night and the staff are attentive and well trained. Now to the food, most of what we had was excellent and the flavors exquisite, however one dish the Mutton was disappointment, not the flavor of the dish or the sauce, the meat was simply inedible, so tough and stringy that it was impossible to chew and swallow. I pointed this out to the headwaiter but simply took no notice, the attitude being “you bought it you eat it” In a restaurant that purports to quality and fine dining (this is an expensive restaurant) the waiter should have responded in a more accommodating manner, I have been a restaurateur on the Gold Coast for many years in the past and would never have been able to treat a customer in this manner. A poor show for a restaurant of this calibe
4
the food and overall experience is good. it can feel a bit stiff for a social gathering though (more suited for a business meeting). the food and drinks in particular are priced extremely high. for instanced, SGD 140 (USD 112) for a bottle of cloudy bay
5
The restaurant is extremely tasteful in modern subdued shades of brown and a great feeling of space and opulence. The lunch buffet is excellent....for starters, taste choices at the buffet (from the chef), with naan bread and the best papadums served at the table, along with a whole range of sensational bite sized appetizers.The main courses were also great....a range of more traditional Indian dishes, with subtle and sensational flavours and textures - the lamb biryani was my favourite.Desserts were a selection of individual small sized glasses and dishes - Eastern rosehip flavours and yoghurts, to Western mousse and ice creams.My summary....The best Indian food I have tasted (although I have not been to India). The lunch buffet is very good value, although drinks are expensive (this is Singapore, after all...). The only improvement could be better inter-reaction or guidance from the chefs to assist in making choices (especially the starters, where the items were less familiar....but turned out to be sensational)
2
Wife and I went with another couple for valentines day dinner. On the website the food looked very attractive - high end Indian dining, the actual presentation on the day was very disappointing. Food quality was mediocre. I had a nut allergy which I explained multiple times and they didn't seem to understand - in total nuts were served in 3 dishes. I spoke to the restaurant manager who offered to comp my dinner but in the end they even forgot to do that, it was a joke. It was valentines day and I had had enough complaining so just paid and left. Shared a bottle of champagne and spent about $350 per couple. Would not return
5
If you get to Singapore, this is not to miss! The surrounding hotel is awesome, the restaurant is beautiful to the eye and pleases the senses, the staff is perfect. There is nothing I can say that would be even slightly negative (and I am tough). Now the food, very traditional foodbut with a stunning presentation and of course tasty and pleasing to the palate. One of the best in my experience!
5
I have been visiting Rang Mahal since the last 10 years for lunches and dinners with family and friends . Awesome food spread covering a variety of spectrum of Indian cuisine . The staff are polite and the service is good . Ambience is awesome . One of my favourite places to host lunches and dinners for business , friends and family 
4
very good hospitality,very attentive staff wide selection of wine food of choice alacarte or set menu very sumptuous
4
- Great tasting North Indian food
- Wide variety and selection
- 1 for 1 on lunch buffets offers an awesome value
- Highly recommended
5
Intoxicating Indian food and an oenophile's wine list to boot. Service is exemplary. We ate there twice during a week's stay. It's pricey, but well worth it for what you receive.
5
I have been to Rang Mahal a few times, with clients for business dinners and also with my wife, every time is a pleasure.The portions are generous, especially the salmon starter, almost enough for a main course. The interior is darkly lit with water ponds along the entrance with some private(ish) style seating before you reach the main room. BUT it seems the restaurant was closed forever for renovations.The price as some say is a tick steep but for such wonderful food, great atmosphere, good service it's most certainly worth it.Highly recommended
5
Located in Pan Pacific, this is Singapore's finest Indian restaurant. Suitable for a special occasion, the location and ambiance is at its very best. In the afternoon, it is well known for its buffet. A notable difference is that the bread and starters are served hot at the table unlike other buffet places. There are special sweets and cake arranged for birthdays to make a person very special.Bottomline, great food, place suited for a special occasion.....
3
Well, if a restaurant prides itself to the on the Top of the line , then it has to work much harder then most others. The lunch buffet with its hefty price tag does not pass the test. Too few offerings and taste does not stand apart.The regular menu seems good, but did not try that. As for the lunch buffet is concerned, it is best avoidable. Perhaps, Tiffins at Raffles is much nicer and better priced.The layout of the hotel for no fault of the restaurant is more like a Railway coach and very little view out of the hotel.Ok for one visit
5
(+) The ambience and decor catches your eye as soon as you walk in. (+) Pleasant and quiet, so that you don't have to shout to have a conversation(+) We got a corner table for a nice romantic dinner(+) Good menu selection (food and drinks)(+) Quick delivery(+) Excellant tasteWe could not find anything to complain about and the price was worth the food/experiance. Will defintely visit agains and will recommend be it a private dinner or a gathering
4
Went there with my family for weekday lunch. Decided to have the buffet as the ala-carte was almost $30-40 per main. There's the usual naans, both garlic and butter. Didn't ask if they had kashmiri AA my wife doesn't like those. There was a fries crispy ladies finger that was almost like crackers. Absolutely wonderful. Usual curries which were nice though I can't remember what they were. Also had desserts though not usual ones like gulab jamon. Ice cream too though a bit melted.

I went there along with my Singaporean friends as they wanted to taste authentic Indian food.The food was most ordinary by any standards. Yes it was Indian food but thats it .There was not even a single dish or dessert which I can say was even above average. If one goes to any dhabha they can get tastier food and at cheaper rate than at this placeI deciced never to go to this place nor to recommend. Recently our dept was planning to go to this Place for dinner I said to them its not the value for money We went to mutthu's curry which was much better than rang maha

Barring my need to wear a sari (no shorts)- we had an excellent meal....in fairness, given the ambiance here, they are right to impose a dress code.Guided by family member who had dined at Rang Mahal before, I let him show me around.A safe bet for anyone who enjoys Indian food and is looking for a refined setting.Would return amd recommend

The decore of this place is enchanting and quality of food is also good. But I found it very expensive.
5
The food at Rang Mahal restaurant attached to the Pan Pacific Hotel, Singapore is trully world class. I really felt like a Maharaja here.
4
The Rang Mahal is located inside the Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel. The food is very good and the room is nice and stylish. This, however, doesn't come cheap!
5
We have a lively get together @ Rang Mahal. Ambiance was good, Food was well prepared to our liking & Staff were attentive. Keep it up.

We were staying at the Pan Pacific, and Singapore-based friend suggested we meet them at Rang Mahal for dinner. I'd walked past the entrance a few times, but when I finally walked in I was blown away by the atmosphere. I'm not going to spoil the surprise by giving details, suffice it to say that the restaurant is beautifully and sparingly decorated, extremely elegant. The excellent impression continued with the service, and then the food itself, delicious Indian food that avoids the cliches and is presented as one of the world's great cuisines should demand. As we were leaving, we had a peek into the private dining room, again an absolutely beautiful space, and I hope I can eventually gather 16 best friends in Singapore to have dinner there

For a hotel restaurant, this is very good though has quite a limited menu if you are a meat eater. This restaurant has a particularly good vegetarian option. For Singapore the prices are quite high, but it is in a high quality hotel, so I was not surprised by that. The food is good, so just enjoy it. The one thing I found disappointing the ambience felt like a hotel restaurant serving Indian food, rather than an Indian restaurant in a hotel
4
Overall ambience of the place with music, decor and very high ceiling is nice. Food very expensive for what you are getting. Portions not huge either to justify it which is fine just pricey. I stayed in the hotel there and love Indian food so it was a no brainer to try it. I'd eat there again. Ideally it would be a business expense due to the high prices on the menu

After a long flight from UK I and my friends were craving for some good Indian food. So we decided to go to Rang Mahal.Well don't be misled by its ambience. The food is HIGHLY OVERPRICED. 30$ for 4 pieces of Samosa. You wonder if the Samosa were flown in from another country.Paneer Masala 30$+ and the dal was something like 33$. The naan was so thick and chewy. The best part is that it took our main course 45 minutes to arrive, ordered and extra portion of naan bread which came after 20 minutes. By that time our hunger was already gone.The sweet lassi. I think this is the worst lassi I have ever had. Where was the part loss of we mentioning a sweet lassi not a watery milk and charged some 10$ for it.Service is very poor and I have been to better restaurants in Singapore. I would strongly suggest visit Yantra in Tanglin Mall. You will not be disillusioned with food choice and the price.Even in the UK I donâ€™t pay so much for delicious Indian food
3
This upscale restaurant had a lovely atmosphere and high prices, but uninspired food. The standard vegetarian dishes we ordered lacked the complex flavors we love in Indian food. The Palak Paneer was especially bland. We left hungry, still craving a good Indian meal.The service was good, but not great. For the price and given the atmosphere, I would have expected outstanding service and delicious food, but was let down on both. Consequently we felt a bit cheated in terms of value
1
I am very liberal giving this restaurant 1 out of 5. We visited this place 3 months ago. And ordered mostly signature dishes like Butter chicken and kebab. Hopeless taste, un-cooked chicken, un-cooked Naan but manager was usually apologetic. He openly said that chicken is not fresh. Well.....then why did you offer at 1st place? Pls do not go over there. Highly overrated place in reviews, over rate in price, Zero in quality and average service attitude
5
Everytime I visit Singapore, I come to the Rang Mahal. This time the decor from inside changed. The food is always excellent here. The food is Halal at the restaurant.
If you visit Singapore, this should be on your list.
5
I dined here twice, with guests from India. I thought the food was fantastic, as did my guests, who said the flavours were authentic though there were a few clever and tasty twist on some of the traditional choices.
5
Excellent ambience and the staff are really helpful. The dishes are well prepared and the choice is very good. Maybe the best Indian restaurant in town.

I had a lunch buffet recently and a dinner with my colleagues a few months back. Both experiences were a bit disappointing. The food is not bad but for the prices charged, I would have expected it to be much above average. Tandoori chicken at lunch was a big let down, as was the black dal. These 2 simple dishes to me is a good test of any restaurant. I remember the tandoori platter being cold and "rubbery" from my dinner as well. Not everything is bad news though. Some of the more exotic dishes were good. Also the dessert in the lunch buffet was very good. In summary I don't think the quality of food is worth what you pay. The ambience is really nice and if you are willing to compromise on taste for a lovely ambience with great service then this is the place to go.

We went for dinner to celebrate my wife's birthday. Excellent ambiance. The restaurant was pretty full. The design and seating was very thoughtful. I loved the fact that for appetizers along with the traditional papads they had khakras with nice sauces to accompany (murabba, pickle and chutney). Ordered a Bloody Mary and a vodka martini. We went for the main course directly - ordering the recommended Pachmel Dal and Bhindi (Lady's finger) along with Garlic Naan. I was pleased to see phulkas on the menu and asked for a pair. The service was surprisingly quick and the food really hot and fresh (especially the phulkas :) Thats all we had. I thought the food was light (maybe it was due to the cooking or maybe due to the Martini :). Of course the bill wasn't light. But that is something that you expect in a top class restaurant. Got my wallet lighter by 160 odd dollars but worth a visit once in a while
5
I had heard that this restaurant was good and it was all true. The setting is very beautiful - exclusive and relaxing. The service is excellent, attentive without being in your face. The food was faultless. It is up there in price if you go the whole hog; entree, main, breads, drinks etc but you could have a reasonable night out and just go for mains, rice and a Martini so you can have the experience and not go crazy on the $
5
We went there to celebrate my bday.it was our first visit. I found the ambience very soothing n relaxing., very friendly staff, good food infact awesome food, I liked the small green mango juice they served before dinner.dont forget to try pancmel daal if vegetarian. Cant wait to go again... :

I was hosting very important business guests, to celebrate major achievements together. It was a difficult choice, with so many options in Singapore. My staff suggested Rang Mahal, and others in the team seconded it. Top Indian restaurant with Michelin stars and a great reputation...seemed like the perfect choice for a group of diverse, high ranking individuals of varied origins from Asia to the UK. We tried to book a private room but they only had one and it was taken for that night, but we decided to carry on and settle for a "corner" table.Overall, the dinner was a success. Everyone loved the food and wine. We ordered assorted kababs which had chicken malai, prawn, lamb chops , lamb sheek kabab and cottage cheese for starters. (For Indian meals, this is a starter!) In the main course, we ordered butter chicken, lamb rogan josh, yellow dal and okhra along with Biryani. Our selections were partly dictated by dietary restrictions and preferences, but there was so much good food for everyone.We ordered some really nice Chardonnay and Merlot from the wine list, which was on the pricey side. But that;s par for the course in a Michelob starred restaurant at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Singapore. The company was great - the food and wine put everyone at ease and the formalities and hierarchies of the corporate world melted away as we dug into the great food and chased it down with the wine.The only drawback was that it was quite noisy. We were not the only group having a great time. Much larger groups coming from cocktails were quite noisy and constrained us from sharing conversations across our table. It would have been perfect if we had the private room. But the world is not perfect and, as the Rolling Stones said, "you can't always get want you want, but if you try sometimes, you get what you need...." This was what we needed to appropriately celebrate our successes
5
I finally visited the restaurant after its been renovated. It was one of my favored places in SG for Indian cuisine and I've got to say that the standards have certainly been raised a notch. I had a business lunch there earlier today and it was a truly pleasant experience. Firstly I love the tasteful interiors. Calming, contemporary and clearly conveys understated luxury. None of the kitschy "Bollywood" inspired decor here. I also popped into their private room - can take 18 diners and has a lounge area too. Sensational.The servers were delightful. Very polite and helpful. The spread was just right. It did not overwhelm as some other Indian buffets can and do! A nice tight selection of meats and veg. They had a live Appam station - that was a lovely surprise. Great breads and Kebabs that were served at the table.The food was flavorful and of high quality. A lovely dessert table. All in all a delightful experience and I walked away truly satisfied.A bit pricey, but hey, worth every cent. Will certainly go back many times

It was hard to find vegetarian food in Singapore so our friends went to Rang mahal since it had indian cuisine....the food was not so indian...got mixed up with some other cuisine i guess and the worst part was the portion size for one person also was too less.......i guess cost cutting there also....was not enough for even one person and we ordered separately..
5
This is an excellent restaurant and dining experience. The food and service was amazing and I can see why it was voted in the top 100 restaurants in the world
5
Really good Indian food with great service. Not cheap but nothing in Singapore is! However the food was to die for!
5
Very exclusive indian restaurant, Food are definitely expensive. The ambience is simply awesome. Food is up to the mark n the drink list are just simply too good. It would be nice if they could have more regular promotions
5
For Mother's day we went to Rang - delicious food, awesome service, great ambiance. On steeper side, but good place for special occasions.
4
Not the place if you're on a tight budget.The whole experience blew me away. I've had a lot of Indian meals of varied results.This place takes it to another level,quality of food,presentation,staff,,.An unbeatable experience.It is on the pricey side,but you get what you pay for,absolutely unforgettable
3
It's hard to put your finger on it but the Rang Mahal always feels like it has something missing. The newer incarnation feels a step up in terms of decor and ambience from the previous version but it still seems to be missing a certain something.The food for one is extremely mild which whilst a trait of North Indian cuisine does leave you wanting for just a bit more spice, the selection of starter options on the buffet is also pretty disappointing.It's all perfectly good with professional service but it always just leaves you feeling a touch disappointed
4
The Pan Pacific hotel structure in itself is a marvel to look at, and the Rang Mahal definitely maintains the best ambience within the restaurant interiors. We went in for a Buffet lunch and the food quality was good as well. Special mention must be made of the Paneer dishes, which were pretty soft and juicy. Their chats were also good and authentic Indian. It would be a costly affair though, as you can come to expect of any other 5* Hotel.Pros: Nice Ambience, Good tasteCons: Limited items on the Buffet menu, Spread could be much better for the price
3
We arrived at 6:30 on a Friday night and were shown to what was described as the last table in a nearly empty restaurant. Sure enough the place was nearly full before we left. Being early we had the advantage of excellent service from the surplus of staff waiting around and the food came out in good time.The atmosphere and quality of the fit out is excellent as was the presentation of the food and drink. Despite this the quality of the food let it down.I would have liked to see more choice on the menu. The mixed entree plate was enjoyable, the lobster was nice and moist but the lamb curry was ordinary. I honestly feel that I've had more choice and better meals at local Indian restaurants in Australia at a fraction of the S$320 we paid for the two of us with a pre-dinner drink each but no wine. I also didn't appreciate being given a survey form and pen at the end of the evening.As it was the only Indian food we tried in Singapore we will try somewhere else next time for a comparison

Had been looking forward to revisiting Rang Mahal after its recent refurbishment. The restaurant is still on the same floor but has shifted to where an Italian restaurant used to be - closer to the lifts. The restaurant has been done up well and we certainly liked the more open and light filled interior compared to the earlier avatar. I guess, on the correct evening, even the alfresco area might be good.The food however, was very disappointing. So was the service. We ordered the "thali". Had to wait almost 35 to 40 minutes for the appetizers to appear. The chicken tikka was hard - had to really apply pressure to cut through the meat. out of 3 items in the appetizer, one was a "samosa". now this was a full size samosa and there were 2 of those and they were quite hot. having one would make you feel quite full. was completely at a loss why 2 were there. thereafter, the third item on the appetizer section took some more time to turn up - that was the salmon. a huge chunk of fish without any taste / flavour whatsoever of the fish itself. the mains were very unappealing - look and taste wise. the caulifower could have been boiled a bit better - was a trifle hard. i thought the lamb smelt a bit odd but then my wife says that i am too strict on the lamb. the prawns were ok and there was just one of those to start with - one had to ask for more - after the 2 samosas and the huge salmon starter this was a bit of an anti-climax. it appearred that the focus was to fill up people up with the appetizers big time. the dessert was really the icing on the cake. the ice cream was supposed to be "chiki" flavour - tasted a cross inbetween butterscotch and vanilla. the gulab jamun - again just one piece and not too big at that and cold.overall disappointing. i think i will give Rang Mahal a miss for some time to come and then turn up. cannot give up on it that easily because this really was the best place in town for north indian food

I heard a lot about Rang Mahal from many locals and visitors alike to give this place a try. But They had been closed for 6 months, and BOY has it opened up looking swankier than ever. I LOVE THE OUTDOOR AREA! its gorgeous for a pre dinner drink and the drinks there are impressive with an outstanding wine list for an asian (especially Indian restaurant). I saw some reviews that said that there was a strong lack of variety, however I beg to differ, I saw over 10 Main dishes, as well as a desert spread. I paid for 4 of us 350 and it was worth it. I think we went into a food coma, but it was helped by the digestive tea that they serve with thier compliments! what a nice touch. bravo team rang mahal! keep it up and open more in other cities! indian food needs to be showcased like this!
3
It used to be a great classy place. But now this is kind of just another place. People with good memories may recall their old place and the charm. If you are new, then this place should be ok.
3
Food was good, but a little too pricey. I'd recommend going to little India along serangoon road for a more authentic experience :)
5
As a lover of all things Indian, a visit to this establishment at the hotel we were staying at was a must.
In a nutshell, it was exquisite!!
4
We went there for our birthday ( my wife and I share our birthday) so it was a double celebration. This year is special because our 4 month old daughter was also out with us.The positivesGood food, served well and backed up by good wine Very helpful staff who went out of their way to make our day special and paid attention to our little oneNice ambience and decor, comfortable seatingWhat could be betterThe menu needs to be more creative, the items could belong to any restaurantThe wine selection is good, there needs to be someone who can pair the food with the wines Will definitely come again. The food you get is worth the price you pay for

Went to Rang Mahal last weekend with my wife. We walked in and were able to get a table. The restaurant was reasonably full. We were received well and was got a good table. The service was good, no complaints about that. The food selection for me, considering North Indian food, was a bit disappointing. The food was good, but way overpriced for what we ordered. I would probably pick another Indian restaurant the next time. Not bad for a special occasion
1
We were eagerly awaiting the reopening of rang mahal. We used to be regulars in this place, as recent movers to Singapore we found this to be one of the best places for Indian food. What a disappointment. We went for lunch today and what a horrible experience. The service was pathetic, the food was bland, undercooked and there was hardly any variety. Some of the food was clearly stale, and both me and my wife have been I'll since we ate there today. The chef refuses to acknowledge that any thing is wrong with the food and is one arrogant man. He should also try and wearing some clean clothes - his grubby uniform does not suite the supposedly upmarket place. And we paid $176 for two for this privilege!! Medication will cost us extra!!!The food standards agency should inspect the kitchen. This place should have stayed closed. Shut it down
4
Rang Mahal at the Pan Pacific has become synonymous with business lunches. Buffet spread is quite lavish and tasty. Some dishes may not have authentic taste but the variation is acceptable and doesn't disappoint. Desserts options are mind blowing!Very good for quick business meetings in short groups. High price is deterrent for family outing except for very special occasions
4
Recently re-opened after a refit apparently this restuarant serves up quality Indian food with a modern twist. Dishes are spicy and filled with flavor whether meat or fish or veg. Service was a bit shaky and I think that's because the people are new but hopefully that improves over time. Dramatic high ceiling in the room makes for a stylish setting. Worth a trip if you are in Singapor
5
We've been regular visitors to Rang Mahal at The Pan Pacific for over a decade now. When they closed recently for their renovation, we were waiting for their re-opening.Well, it's now better than before.A dark passage way leads to a wonderful bright dining area. The interiors are light, bright and elegant in an understated way.We went for the weekday buffet at the introductory price of SGD 55 per person.The weekday buffet now has a live station and during our visit, it was serving Dosas with a delightful vegetarian filling.The standard high quality and great tasting main dishes haven't changed much thankfully. The staff come around with about 2-3 other freshly made dishes.The desert counter is splendid as always.A new addition was saffron and masala tea served at the table.In all, Rang Mahal has maintained their great food and vastly improved their setting. Great jo

It's a well know place for up market Indian food, so my expectations were pretty high. I went their with my wife and 2 children. We ordered veg starters, presentation was very nice and tasted good. Portion size were average, enough for one person only. Main course was also had good presentation, taste and portion size average.What we didn't like was service quality and pricing. Waiter mixed up our order and whole food sequence was got wrong. Overall, we enjoyed the dinner
3
The ambiance and location is very good, but we found it too expensive! Food is good, but I am sure same quality of food can be found cheaper else where as well.
1
Visited Rang mahal while staying in Festive hotel and the food was simply terrbile . The nans were burnt and the chicken was undercooked. The kids left half the food untouched
1
The food was a lttle too expensive for the measly portions served. There was also cloying scent of burnt coconut that was off putting, wafting in the dining hall that sticks to you even after you walked out of the restaurant.
4
Rang Mahal is placed as the place to entertain corporate clients looking for high end Indian cuisine. The place is well laid out and reflects the high end market positioning of Rang mahal and its sister outlets. The food quality is consistent .
5
great food, lovely ambiance and good service.Had been there for one of the occasions. One of the best fine dining areas. Would love to visit rang mahal once more..
5
While on travel through Singapore, stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel and enjoyed a very nice dinner at the Rang Mahal Restaurant. Very attentive staff and excellent food within a very convenient location at the Pan Pacific Singapore-Marina hotel.
5
i would say its a very good place for official fine dinning diner, expensive exclusive.
4
A bit isolated in the Sentosa resort, a very posh place, nice food, real traditional Indian food, I really enjoyed it the service was great as well. They will cater for all and are happy to make things on the fly that are not on the menu, nice touch for my kids. naturally it is not cheap here, but hey I was on Holiday
2
I find the food very expensive and lacks quality. I expected masala dish n makni dishes to hv distinct flavours. Not here. If queried u wld be told 'this is how we do it here'.Decoration- passe. Dim lighting is used to hide poor house keeping.They need to work on their hygine. Staffs touching their body parts n not washing their hands thereafter.Too complacent probably because located in a prestigious hotel
4
For all those looking for quality food out in Singapore, take my words and try out this restaurant. Though its a bit expensive, but for a change and to please your taste buds once in a while, this restaurant will serve as a decent change.Service is quick and efficient. Food is great and lastly ambience is awesome. !Perfect place for a treat (with GFs) ;)Abhishe
5
If you've never tried a high end Indian restaurant, then Rang Mahal will blow your socks off. It's fantastic - just don't order too much food as I do every time I visit....
5
Great Environment
Good Service
I can confirm that the food is authentic
Fresh and High quality ingredients
Not Cheap
5
food - excellent ; ambience- super
service - sharp & helpful
Indian vegetarian hard to get in Sentosa ,Ahh!! this is a fresh water oasis in the desert,You can take my word you will love the food.Soft Naans,curries,Veg.Biryani all are wonderful.
5
Incredible setting, great service and wonderful menu - loved the variety of Indian cuisine! The staff did a great job of walking us through the menu to help us choose what we'd most enjoy. True find dining!
5
feel like a royalty eating in this indian restaurant. very good food. great environment!!!
4
Step into the world of mystical sensual atmosphere for a dinning escapade that stimulates all your senses...
Be prepared to be overwhelmed by your bill too after it all ends!
4
One of the first few Northern Indian Restaurant.that has been around for a long time. Good quality Northern Indian cuisine. A bit expensive but again you are also paying for the ambience as its located inside a deluxe hotel
5
I've had my fair share of Indian meals but this was absolutely outstanding and first class. We only wanted a small amount so shared a starter and main course between us but that didn't stop them bringing tasters and "amuse bouche" between courses, tempting our palates and exciting our taste buds. The menu was unusual and beautifully cooked as well as delicious.We travelled to Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand and Singapore on this month long trip and Rang Mahal was by far the best meal we ate. In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's the best Indian meal I've ever had
4
Singapore has wide range of options when it comes to Indian food but Rang Mahal is the finest when it comes to Fine Dining...The Yellow tadka daal i had was divine and the best daal i have ever had in an Indian restaurant anywhere in the world..
4
The restaurant has a bread bar (my kind of place, for sure!), though during my visit I didn't try any - just too many other tempting things on the menu. There are scores of vegetarian options and many meat/fish selections as well. Try the chickpea dish that they make at the table -very cool. The smoked eggplant entree was delicious and not too spicy. I can't recall what dishes my colleague had (I remember one was a chicken dish), but he liked his food as well. We did not try any of their desserts, so can't speak to those. Service was average. The restaurant also made a bit of a production of our not having made a reservation, though it was clearly 1/2 empty, but we were seated very quickly
5
perfect service & we had delicious food. great selection of wine. also tried mojito. Well done
1
worse food ever in my life... it was aweful and expensive.
4
Located in Pan Pacific Hotel, the ambience is condusive for business lunch/dinner. The portion is just right and the taste is not to over-powering for non-indians' palate.
5
The restaurant is on the 3rd level of the Pan Pacific Hotel. The ambience is exceptionally romantic and elegant. definitely special for a date. The food was great. Indian but rather innovative and modern. Service was also top. Prices are OK. Definitely reccomended
5
Feel like a King here, some of the best Indian food options are here. Amazing service and food quality. Expect to pay the price though.
5
wow gret food try the jaljeera and also the kesari jalebi. lunch buffet is really good
5
In our view, this is the most refined indian food we have had anywhere (including London, US, India and other Singapore restaurants). This a great option for a special occasion dinner because of the stylish setting and attentive service. We recommend ordering a range of dishes to test the kitchen's full capacity. Also try a number of new dishes because this is the place to try them...since sharing is the dining style...assemble a group of 4 to 6 people so you can try more dishes. Nothing we ordered disappointed. All that said...it is pricey. As anyone familiar with Singapore dining knows, you can pay $2.50 for a very good meal at a hawker center or $250 for a very good meal in an elegant setting...the wonder of the Singapore food experience
5
This is a perfect place for business lunch or dinner as the place is very presentable and the food variety is great while the food is also excellent. I don't have to think hard when it comes to selection of Indian food business lunch or dinner in Singapore
5
They have won all sorts of awards and it is not surprising. I love Indian food and have eaten it all over the world (except in India!) and this is then best I have had. It is, however, madly expensive. So the solution is to try the lunchtime buffet which is not too badly priced and had a very diverse range. Same five star service and ambience but you only pay for what one dish would cost from the a la carte menu.
4
Rang Mahal is located in the very outdated and depressing Pan Pacific Hotel. But as soon as you enter the restaurant, you forget all about that. Dim lights, candles, well spaced tables and comfy chairs welcome you and the attentive do their best to make you comfortable and happy.The menu is not extensive but there is enough interesting items to choose from and the food quality is very good. Budget US$200for 2 including 2 drinks, 1 appetizer and 2 main courses. Meat dishes will run you more
5
In the Pan Pacific Hotel, this Indian really is refined and worth the price. The food is excellent and the setting very nice. Can´t go wrong.
5
awesome indian food at the Pan Pacific .this restaurant is a great fine dining expericne ,well doen interiors and very warm hospitality .Food quality is excellant and serves a wide variety of Veg and Non Veg cuisines .Must dine place in Singapore
5
This restaurant is by far the best Indian I have had in my life. Extremely tasty beef curry, not too hot. A lovely service from the waitress and waiter, absolutely fantastic! When i am in singapore next, will def fit this into my schedule.
5
if you want excellent indian food , visit this restaurant in pan pascific hotel

We were really looking forward to eating here after having read rave reviews on TA and in various travel guides. What a let down. The food definitely did not live up to expectations and, surprisingly for Singapore, the service was inattentive.A triumph of style over substance - the place looks alright, but by London standards it's nothing special. The restaurant tries to evoke a stylish, moody setting with dozens of tea lights everywhere, but fails - it's just dark.The portions are generous (sharing portions, one dish between 2), but at these prices they'd have to be (we paid £75 for 3 veg mains, some accompaniments and a couple of soft drinks). We ordered 3 vegetarian main dishes with various accompaniments, all of which were average at best. The mixed veg raita was watery - I'd expect a £10 raita to be thick and luxurious (more like a greek yougurt) than the lassi-like consistency I was offered. The waiter then had the nerve to tell me that this is what a raita should be like - as if this was my first time in an Indian restaurant! It's worrying when a 'top end' restaurant can't get the most basic thing right.If, despite reading the dispariing reviews you decide to visit Rang Mahal, call ahead and book a table, otherwise you might end up in a 'corridor booth', just outside the main restaurant. We had just arrived in Singapore and checked into the Pan Pacific, so did not have the opportunity to book a table beforehand. Besides being dark, you tend to get overlooked in this corridor, notwithstanding the high ratio of staff to guests. At one point there were 4 waiters hovering in our section, all of whom were totally oblivous to us.We're certain that Singapore has better quality Indian food to offer and certainly at less extortionate prices (£5 for a naan?!?). I know the Pan Pacific is a 5* business hotel, but the quality of the food and service was out of keeping with the pricing. I'm not giving it a 1 out of 5 overall, only because the food was at least edible

I have been to this restaurant at least 4 times in 2011 between March and Nov'11. I like the food and ambience, its truly Indian and very delicious. But on 15th Nov'11 when I visited the restaurant with my 3 friends, I was shocked to find that the staff and management are highly insensitive to the guests and customers. I reached the restaurant at 10pm and came to know that it was their closing time. Being a foreigner in Singapore, I was not aware that the restaurants in 5 star hotels are not open after 10pm. I requested them to allow us to have the meal as we had to catch the flight late that night. However they didn't yield and we had to go hungry that night, almost. The reason for being so particular about that place was that we were all strictly vegetarian.Fortunately there was a veg restaurant at the Changi Airport and we had the dinner finally at 1am next day.....So I can say that Rangmahal at Pan Pacific is a good restaurant with bad people..
5
It looked like it was going to cost us a bomb looking at the style and class of decor! But voila, we were pleasantly surprised! The ambience was fantastic... the food was excellent... we loved every single dish we ordered... which is quite rare in our case.. I specially recommend hara bhara kabab as a starter.. it was so soft, it practically melted in the mouth...After having loved Yantra, we thought it would be hard to match that experience... I am happy to say Rang Mahal proved us wrong
5
great food and service. always go there for occasions. the best so far for indian fine dining
5
I happen to visit the restaurant with my office colleagues, as usual we never booked for a table, thinking it should be easy to get one. reaching to the restaurant, we were surprised to see how busy it was and were wondering if we could be given a table! Gladly, the host managed to get us a table in 10 minutes and we were so thrilled to get on to our job of eating. the restaurant setting is immaculate and food is outstanding. i particularly like the waiter walking around to serve specials of the day. the buffet spread was brilliant, and the food tasted equally well. our waiter seemed to be busy with many other tables, but he never left an eye from ours. he did an excellent job to serve us fresh indian bread on table. will surely be back, but this time will make a booking :

The Experience as we went through 1. I called your restaurant phone to be answered by some lady called Ms.Sunita (at the reception of Rang Mahal). She sounded bit strange as inspite of suggesting that this was the first time we were coming to this restaurant and since we were celebrating my wife’s birthday I wanted her to suggest one of the good tables. She was totally insensitive towards the occasion and was keen to put down the phone even before I could complete what I wanted to say2. Upon landing at the restaurant , instead of being polite she was blunt (not to mention the stern expressions) but me wearing capris (3/4 trousers) to the restaurant. I simply told her that I respect every organizations regulations but she should have told be this dress code when I communicated to her that we were coming to the restaurant to the first time. Being asked to wear some cloth (which is nothing to do with the tradition of the cuisine was weird. Also, I could see people moving into the restaurant wearing crumpled night suite and bath room slippers). Anyways, don’t want to waste more time on this as Mr.Sachi permitted us to have table in existing dress code. 3. We ordered the food/starters and drinks (Horrible food)a. Pani Puri : was nowhere near what the dish is supposed to be ( it always has a filling. The chef doesn’t even know how to prepare this basic)b. Chicken Tikka : Was tasteless and had skin on the pieces ( in this cuisine , chicken is always without skin …and one of the most delicious dishes)c. Bombay Fish ( made from Seabass fish) : This fish is my favourite and something I eat regularly. However, at your restaurant it tasted horrible and it was surely not freshd. Drinks i. We ordered for Virgin Pina-colada ( without ice )ii. What we got – Virgin Maryiii. We got a replacement as Virgin Pina-colada ( FULL of ice ) .The main misbehaviour started from here onwards ………..4. Upon asking the server Mr.Sidhu that we ordered without ice as our son had a bad throat he made a nasty face and simply walked away leaving the drink as it is on the table. Upon calling him back he didn’t turn around simply asked another colleague Manjot to handle our table ( clearly waving his hand that he didn’t want to even look back)a. Upon getting insulted we requested Manjot to give us a piece of paper and share the names of Sidhu and Sunita …. Giving us the paper , Manjot also walked away “without” even asking to be excused or mentioning anything. We looking at the staff like fools and all of them gathered at another corner for some conference / gossipb. The only person who seemed to interested in serving us and had a smile on his face was Mr.Ahmed. Rest were a bunch of frustrated people who had clear intentions of misbehaving with the guest and his family5. We summoned Mr.Sachi assuming he is the manager, the person was “expression less” ( before coming to our table he made a nasty face which my wife also saw )6. Finally we decided to ask for the cheque/bill and to our surprise there were items ( 2 x Roti’s) mentioned in the bills which we never ordered. After pointing out these abnormalities , he got the bill corrected.In short, for a family which valued every such important occasion in their lives and wants to keep memorable experiences….. your staff’s attitude ( and the Chef’s horrible skills ) completely ruined our evening and my wife’s birthday. Food I can understand that people can have different expectations in terms of taste ….but REPEATED MISBEHAVIOR in NOT acceptabl

Excellent food it was the best Indian we have ever eaten in! Great choices for both meat eaters and vegetarians!
Simple out of this world!

Very easy to describe the food in this restaurant. EXCELLENT!
Perfect location and staff.

Food was teasty and served well. Ambience was nice with friendly staff. Tried their a la carte dinner on special occassion.
If price is not a concern, you must visit this place inside Pan Pacific Hotel to enjoy exotic, delicious Indian food.

A little pricey but well worth it due to high quality of the food.

We have been before (years ago) and thought it was time to try again as something "modern" rather than traditional style indian. The service was "odd" with the waiter actually telling us we could not order a dish in a strong way.The food was weird - minced lamb with chunks of lamb - ugh - there was nothing nice about the meal.Beautiful atmosphere but that was it. And expensive too over $380 for 3 people and went home hungry....we will not be bac

Yummy and the service is excellent .... we love the ambience and the presentation. Tandoori prawns rock! and I have not tasted such delicious samosas any where else (except my moms LOL) the servings are generous. Their other outlet Vansh is as good .... Yes the price is above average ..but we pay for the overall experience .. similar to a nice Italian or French restaurant! I have been there 3-4 times and have always enjoyed it .. so if you like North Indian cuisine ,care for the experience and don't have a problem paying for a nice dinner you must try it out! :) Good Job Rang Mahal Team .. its good to see shift of North Indian cuisine from a restaurant down the road to a dining option with ambience..(after all its the food of the Moghal Emperors :

we were staying near the Pan Pacific and were looking forward to some good Indian food , but were very, very dissapointed by the taste of our meal.we have eaten Indian on 4 continents and are Indian ourselves; so believe me these guys are over priced and seriously lacking in good authentic Indian taste.it was the blandest dal makhni i has ever come across; and the kebab and chicken was virtually tasteless.rather trave to Little India for some authenticity

The only reason i chose this place was due to the reviews on TA and the fact that we stayed at the Pan Pacific. I have travel extensively and some how hv indian food during my holidays and i can tell you that i have never in my entire life eaten such horrible food.. and to top it all its very expensive. i have had indian food in japan, cambodia, bali, thailand and by far this has been the worse.. even cambodia has better food. i have no words to describe my ordeal... my family and friends shared my sentiments and it's not my personal opinion. i usually only write reviews on hotels i have visited and not restaurant but i was obliged to do so in this case as the food by far is the worse ever. PLEASE DONT EAT HERE!!!!!

What can I say, from the freshly made naans and the healthy refreshing drinks to the wonderful food and great service. I have been four times now, and will be in Singapore in April and will definately go again. This establishment introduced my son to Indian food, previously he had been a bit boring in his choice of diet and this opened a whole new world of cusine. The entrance lounge is particularly stunning.I'm going back there in April this year - looking forward to it!

Rang Mahal came to my attention after leaving Keyaki (fantastic restaurant also located at Pan Pacific Singapore ). I absolutely adore Indian food (north & south ) decided to make reservations for dinner. We arrived about 10 min. early and were not greeted or ask into the lounge area ( so the host service was pretty standard for Singapore .. bad ... just so unaware ). So we popped down to the bar to have a quick drink before dinner. We arrived back at the restaurant where we were seated at a very nice table and attended to by a fine waiter. He was efficient, friendly & helpful. We ordered a few staples ( samosas & butter chicken ) & a few new things lamb chops, tomato soup ( my personal favorite ) & jumbo prawns ( delicious) ...which were prepared exquisitely. The lamb chops were a tiny bit over seasoned ( with more of a salty taste), but LOTS of layers & interesting spice/herbal blends. The food kept our attention for sure!For a nice fine dining experience, Rang Mahal is the place. Our bill was $220 ( without any alcohol) so a bit pricey, but get over it ... Singapore is no place for tight wads!If you're on a budget, go to Sammys or Banana Leaf Apollo ( where you wont get service, depth of food or ambiance, but you will get good Indian Food )!Rang Mahal ... we will see you again soon! Kudos

If you like Indian food don't miss the Rang Mahal. I am half Indian and my father used to have a chain of restaurants so I am hard to please. I never visit Singapore without dinner here. Exceptionally trendy ambiance with the best food.

My son and I enjoy Indian and have had some really good memories but this place really tops them all. The menu was not extensive and we only ordered a few dishes but everything was very tasty and enjoyable. Our waiter was quick except when we asked for the bill but that is a small quibble. We arrived without a reservation and were quickly seated in a booth near the opening that had complete privacy. I would certainly like to return

We're not keen on buffets - usually. For Rang Mahal however, we make that exceptiont. They offer such a superb choice of Indian food, prepared by highly skilled chefs in a very civilised and stylish environment and without any hassle. Good wine list, attentive service, relaxed yet upmarket setting and ambiance. It you're looking for great Indian food, look no further

We love Indian food but like many of you, we most of the times end up ordering dishes we know already and by doing so, we do miss out on a lot of variety. Now of course, going to a buffet style restaurant would allow us to try many different things but then again, butffets are really not at all our style since they mostly lack atmosphere, style and class. Rang Mahal is different. Think of a high end and stylish setting, gourmet level cuisine by well known chefs and good service. Now how cool is that

Singapore has so many excellent, and affordable Indian restaurants that the existence of Rang Mahal doesn't seem entirely necessary, other than to make money.The food here is no better than any of the good restaurants in Little India, Song of india or Yantra but is substantially more expensive.The decor is lavish, if a litle gloomy but the lack of atmosphere and snooty service make this place distinctly un-Indian.If you want to flash a bit of cash on a really good indian feast, head for Vintage India in Dempsey

I LOVE Indian food, and always eat Aloo Gobi wherever I go. This was the best aloo gobi and best naan I've ever had. All of our dishes were great. Service good, gorgeous interior, open kitchen. Very expensive but better than other places with the same prices, and seems competitive for Singapore
1
Overpriced rubbish. How a restaurant could do such a good job on ambiance and service and such a bad job on food beats me. The kachoris were stale and days old, and the curries and dal were not subtle- just bland. The breads were no better than jaggi's where an entire meal could be had for the cost of one naan at rang mahal. If there is a hell for uninspired cooks there is a place Reserved for whoever slaps together the food at rang mahal. Take your friends there only if you want to lose them

As top class Indian restaurants go, this is the cat's whiskers. The menu is diverse with exotic concoctions you won't find on any common or garden Indian takeaway menu and -- as an added bonus -- the food actually tastes good as well. Apart from the quality of the tucker, I keep going back because of the high standard of service (a rare commodity in Singaporean restaurants). I'm docking a mark for atmosphere on this occasion because we were led to a table immediately adjacent to a loud American, which was a tad distracting at times. I guess they thought a loud Australian wouldn't mind

This Indian restaurant at the Pan Pacific is counted amongst the best in SIngapore. Went there in May and it did not disappoint! The food was good - the non-veg items particularly and the kulfi. The veg selection could have been better. But the service was very salesy. Seeing a big corporate team which was less on time and had representation from different geographies (making it difficult to finalize the options), the staff was keen to sell more so that they could raise the bill value (even though they knew a lot of it would go waste). Very unexpected (and dissappointing) at any place these days, let alone a known 5-star property

Rang Mahal restaurant at Pan Pacific Hotel is one of the best Indian dining restaurants in Singapore.The staff & service is incredible and food is fantastic. The ambiance and settings of the restaurant is mesmerizing.Really one of the best places for luxurious food lovers to indulge in!!!

the mango lassi in Rang Mahal is delicious and service is excellent. Hidden away in Pan Pacific at Marina Sq. Try it ! About US$35 per pax excluding wine.

Thumbs up for great service and lovely decor

Wide variety of well prepared dishes. High quality for a lunch buffet. Sufficient vegetarian options. Great chutneys.

I have been eating at this restaurant since the old Oberoi Imperial Hotel days. Love the food, the ambience, the decor... everything is just right for me.

Nice food and ambience.

love the food

Wow... this place serves some excellent Indian food! Probably one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been too. The only downer is the very expensive prices. If you don't care about the price, this is the place to go! It has it all, excellent food, great atmosphere, and wonderful service. You deserve it to yourself if you love Indian food to go at least once

We ate here the last night of our 3 week honeymoon. The food was supberb and plentiful but the service was extremely poor. It was the worst service we had on the whole of our 3 week trip and yet it was the most expensive restaurant that we visited. We were sat on the first booth as you enter the restaurant and were completely ignored. At no point were we asked if we wanted a refill of our drinks or how our food was. One staff member actually started shouting at another staff member behind our table.Very nice settings but the place did not seem to have much atmosphere but perhaps that was only because we were sat right at the front and did not get to experience the rest of the restaurant or even see it. I would recommend this restaurant only for the food

We attended during a Singapore food festival (the World Gourmet Summit in April/May 2009), where a one-star Michelin chef, Atul Kochar (of London’s Benares Restaurant) was putting his stamp on signature dishes. There were several tasting menus to choose from that Kochar had specially put together; we opted for the “epicurean” versions, one meat, one vegetarian, which, the waiter assured me, were geared to a single person’s appetite. Unfortunately, in the end, there was too much food. That said, it was exquisitely prepared and amazingly good, just too much. For years I’ve been eating Indian at Vij’s, in Vancouver, from his very first “restaurant” which he started with his family in a hole in the wall with Ikea furniture and six tables, to his grand miniature empire nowadays: Vij’s, Rangoli and take away. And while Vij gave Indian cooking a stunning overhaul, receiving international praise for his dishes (see most recently, Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s comments on his menu), updating and improving on classic home-style dishes, the Rang Mahal Kochar menu took Indian food into a whole new realm. Each dish had subtle and interesting flavours, many with just an intriguing nuance. It was true fusion, not a distortion from authentic cooking, but building and enhancing on classic Indian cuisine with innovation and expertise. Though, while the menu was wonderfully varied, and ample, with full marks to the kitchen, the same could not be said on the floor. Wait and bus staff seemed harried, forever in conference, often (irritatingly) in front of clientele, dishes were coming out of the kitchen, changing hands on the floor, things were being put down then picked up again, spoons appeared in front of us then disappeared just as suddenly, our amuse bouche never materialized, the rushed pace of the wait staff lending itself to anxiety, and overall the front of house was somewhere between the Keystone Cops and something much less dignified (if you know what I mean). The room, in its odd L shape, offered some strange dining experiences too: The entrance has quiet banquettes, but they feel removed, in another place, like a foyer; the main room has three sections, for which you’re either in the front near the bustle of staff or stuck in the back; finally there is a gorgeous, dimly lit set piece on a riser, what’s often showcased in advertisements, but again it’s as though that section is a stage, a rendering, not inherently part of the main space. There is little flow and no confluence between the areas. It reminded me of walking through rooms in a museum, each with a different and not connected focus. If dining is a three-tiered experience (food, service, ambiance), I would rate the food (Kochar’s version at least) off the charts, Indian food as I never imagined it being done, and next time in London I would be heading straight to Benares. But as far as Rang Mahal goes, I would be much less generous in terms of the space and service, and wary to return

Rang Mahal has always been serving fabulous food even when it was in the late 80s...and by god has it changed and improved astronomically. After the Revamp Rang Mahal looks like a cutting edge modern restaurant with few accent pieces of India (super trendy and hot, think W hotel styled)This is a MUST place to impress clients (try the buffet, trendy, and a lot of options are available!) But for a more romantic side i would book the pavilion seating that overlooks the water feature, its simply mind blowing how an Indian restaurant like this can be so chic and upmarket. Although this comes with a hefty price tag, the food is modern and traditional. There is Foie Gras as well as the usual Indian favorites but presented impeccably well. I recently tried their other sister restaurant Vansh, which is also very surprising but not as high end (its a nice place to lounge with friends)Now if only there was a Rang Mahal in every city i frequent

Only tried the buffet here, it was pretty good. The mains were on a whole the usual popular indian dishes, desserts were interesting.
