Tried the laksa and it was great. Food price was not too high. Food choices was, as always, the same.
5
5 stars. Food and interactive experience was great. Did not seem exploitative to us. The Orangutans were there of their free will ( albeit for the food) and could leave anytime.
4
The restaurant staff were very friendly and helpful, the food was ok but not a great choice. Breakfast with the Orangutan was a bit rushed but still worth the experience. Certainly recommend it.
4
Surprisingly,the foods are good. Pricing wise..they are cheaper compare to the other reastaurant that my family been with.( those inside the park.)
1
First of all I'm from Singapore. The food was terrible and everything is overpriced, however the entertainment from the orang utans made up for it.
5
Beautiful meals with minimal damage to the wallet. Good variety and spread. The place is well airconditioned and clean. Loves the Indian and Malay food here.

If you're visiting the zoo as a tourist, you absolutely have to do this and if you're a local, you totally should do this at least once in your life!We brought my 1 yo for breakfast with the Orang Utans and he simply loved seeing the animals from close proximity. The food is an international buffet spread so there's something for everyone and the quality isn't too bad either.Also what is great is that while the animals are on show, they are doing their own thing and you do get to take photos with them but there is no physical interaction so I don't feel this is exploitative either.The staff were friendly too and it was generally a very pleasant experience

Named for an orangutan who was confiscated as a household pet and brought to Singapore Zoo in 1971 (and who died in 2008, having become an iconic figure in the duration), Ah Meng is the main restaurant in the zoo. This has two sections—bistro outside and a larger, food court like area inside, with lots of tables and benches (and high chairs galore). This, the food court, was where we chose to go.This place has a few counters, serving soupy noodle dishes; Western dishes; local specialties; and Indian food. There’s also a counter which specializes in fruit juices and smoothies. We chose two local specialties—a Hainanese chicken rice set, and a Nasi Lemak with sambal fish, and with a ‘Melon Medley’ from the juice counter. Later, in the mood for a refreshing dessert, we also had a tropical fruit cup.Here’s what I thought of all we had:Hainanese chicken rice set. Succulent and very good chicken, flavourful rice, and a nice comforting broth. Delicious baby bok choy.Nasi Lemak with sambal fish. Pandanus-scented rice with boiled egg, cucumber, peanut and fried shallot garnishes, a side of green beans stirfried with strips of fried tofu, and, on the side, the fish. The fish was very fresh, smeared with a spicy, tasty sambal paste and steamed. Excellent. Melon Medley. A mix of three juices: rock melon, honeydew, and watermelon. Refreshing and lovely. Tropical fruit cup. A tall glass of cut tropical fruit—watermelon, pineapple, dragon fruit, and rock melon. I loved this: it was bursting with delicious fruit at its very best. Fantastic. While you have to place your order and pick up your tray from the counter yourself, there are people to clear tables if needed. No cutlery, crockery or paper napkins, condiments, or other stuff is at the tables: whatever you need, you must collect from the central space next to the counters. We spent S$33 for our meal
3
The menu, food and price inside an attraction were all okay. The main issue we had was there seemed to be multiple queues to the different food areas but some people thought it one queue so this caused confusion and frustration as there a number of disgruntled customers. We had our lunch around 2 and which meant they were cooking more food so we had a wait for some items. One of the meals was a chicken dish which arrived only partially cooked
3
Went to the restaurant at 1000, opening time.Was the first customer whom waited at the counter for 10mins before ordering as there was no one serving.Same person whom served me macaroni was the same person whom served me coffee. Had to wait 10 mins per item and waited another 10 mins at the counter. Not a good system considering I went during off peak hours.Have to be better.
2
The tables are dirty. People are suppose to take their own tray but it does not work that way so basically the outside tables stay dirty. The food ( indian thali) was absolutely tasteless.
2
This place is usually very crowded & the food quality it offered was very poor compared to price it charged.. The Price is also expensive.. its better to eat out side the zoo
4
The food was served on time and the waiter was so polite though the space was a bit limited because of the crowds
4
We had a great lunch at this restaurant but I wished they had had some kid friendly options other than just fried food.
4
Great breakfast buffet selection at the Jungle Breakfast. Lots of opportunities for photos with the Orang Otans.
4
Hungry, we decided to eat here and very glad that we did. We both had a bowl of Laksa which was very tasty and filling. If you've never had it we would recommend that you do. Service was good and quick you order and get a buzzer thing which allows you to find a seat. When your meal us ready they buzz you and you go and collect. Simple, definately worth eating hear

I've been thinking about doing the breakfast with orangutans every time we come to Singapore but just never got around to it, but decided to treat myself for my birthday.The orangutans (two mothers with their babies) were incredible to see so close up and to watch the three year old's antics exploring the space and swinging in the rope strung behind the trees behind the podium. They were on display for about an hour and in that time we got to stand in front and have our photo taken by their photographer as well as with our camera phone. all fabulous so far...The breakfast buffet was dreadful! There was quite a lot of choice but the "hot" selection I tried was cold and tasteless & my husband concurred that the food was woeful.If you love orangutans, I would recommend the experience, but just don't have high expectations of the food
3
Another place for disappointment, pay through nose in Singapore $ and yet get a food that its not even hot. Prepared long before and lost its flavour. Tourist after long tour of zoo has no place to rely but this grandeur looking Restaurant who mint money without least concern on value for mone

We are Indians and came to Singapore for tourism. Me, my husband and his parents went to Zoo yesterday and to our surprise we got a very rude and unwelcoming response from the receptionist in Ah Meng Restaurant within the zoo. We are vegetarian and we inquired about 'Herbs and cheese sandwich' if that contained egg/meat. The guy at the counter rolled his eyes and rudely told us 'Go to that restaurant and have vegetable biryani if you want vegetarian' as if I'm asking for free food. Throughout the conversation he was irritated and had made faces. We bought the food and even the token was not handed over to me with the bill, he went and kept it on tray counter with a grumpy face.I noticed it was not his usual behavior as the next customer was greeted and served with a smile. They were locals and it was easy for them to talk in local language.So if you talk in English and you have money to buy your own food yet you will be treated as a beggar in this restaurant. Please avoid going here

Ah Meng Restaurant is a tribute to Singapore's most famous orangutan Ah Meng who passed away a few years ago. She was their most beloved resident and her story is fascinating to read.The restaurant offers a lot of variety in terms of cuisines, so there's a lot to look forward to. Make sure you're very hungry when you get there
5
Deicious laksa afordable price ,highly reccomended.must go there from 8am to 2pm .to taste this delicious noodle with coconut milk and spicies
4
We had a quick Indian Vegetarian Lunch here.
The food and prices are good though not extraordinary!
Being a touristy place finding a place when needed can be an issue and a bit of waiting may be needed!
3
Had lunch while at the zoo. Had the famous Nasi Lemak. It was quite a good portion though the chicken lacked flavour.
4
We tried Ah Meng while in Singapore Zoo.
It was so crowded on Saturday lunchtime, but we entered anyway because the food choices could satisfy all family members'taste.
1
I waited 5 mins before I was served as some of the servers were having food behind. After waiting for a while they told me my fish bee hoon soup will be served without milk. At 2 times the price (or more) compared to other places, the food quality is terrible.My husband ordered the Indian food and he was still hungry after eating the serving. It was bland, tasteless and underwhelming. We walked all the way to kidz world to get some decent food. (KFC) Please step up the food standard at the Ah Meng restaurant it was a huge disappointment. I will never go back there again
3
If you have a breakfast package at the hotel then get up early and eat there before he Zoo. Its really busy lots of people and maybe I am just a bit fussy but the quality of the food is just not there. Its a small variety of breakfast dishes that are replenished frequently. The Orangutans are awesome watching them on there platform was amazing, but have you photo taken is a production line you in then you out. Cost of a photo with the Zoo is $25. Small tip if you have children who want to buy a stuffed Orangutan then get it at the breakfast as it is much cheaper then getting later at the gift shop
5
This is a must when visiting this fabulous zoo. lovely buffett breakfast with everything you could want. You are left to enjoy this before they start the experience. The orangutans are called over from their enclosure and they sit and eat sugar cane, they are so at ease. its so exciting when they first come down, you are then invited to line up for a photo where you are so close. They stay for about 30 mins and I was mesmerised by them and kept going back up to the rope between us. They make eye contact but are just not fazed at all. They are not treated like pets at all and the keepers just encourage them to stay by calling them. Then they go on their way back through the trees. I loved thi
3
Many options for lunch but busy and the chaotic service tested our patience a little. You can eat outside the packed foodcourt and watch the young orangutans play in the trees next to the restaurant, which is a pleasant and relaxing break from the busy zoo
4
It is likely you will visit the eating places whilst on a visit to the Zoo and the choice was pretty good. You wouldn't expect 5 star food at such a venue, so don't be over- expectant. Having said that, it was okay and did the job required
4
Limited options for the buffet but pretty ok. Noticed they don't really refill, when the food is done, that's it. You get to see Ah Meng, restaurant is named after their main zoo superstar. I suggest you guys get a voucher as the price doesn't really suffice, in my case, I got my breakfast voucher from Klook. Good discount
4
A good selection of eastern and western food at reasonable prices. Had breakfast buffet . Very satisfied. And a good selection of foods at lunch
4
We had lunch late, set up like a food court, prices were acceptable. If it was very busy it might be hard to get a table to sit at. No Naan available during the week though? (At the Indian choice).
4
The food is quite nice but the prices are very expensive like you could find cheaper alternatives at hawker centres or Mcdonalds restaurants.
2
The Restaurant was over crowded with people just sitting and waiting for the rain to end, we had to wait 40min to find a free table.
The food was ok but not worth the waiting, and in my opinion not worth the price.
4
Went here for lunch. Had fish n Chips and it was absolutely great. Others had hot dog and it was also good. Not much choice in Singapore Zoo.
1
The food is bad, the set up with tables so close is horrible, and breakfast with the orang tans is a scam. You'll get a photo and that's it.
4
Ah Meng is located inside the Singapore zoo. This is a cafeteria style restaurant that has several food stations to choose from. Pick up a tray when you enter and choose what. I was there with a friend and we ate from station 2 which was called Lion City Favorites, my friend chose the Hainanese Chicken Rice Set and I chose the Roasted Chicken Rice Set. Both included Soup and Vegetable.After picking up your food your next stop will be the Drink Station and then the cash register. The place was pretty packed so we headed outside to the several tables set up outside.We both enjoyed our meals, it was the best food that I have ever eaten at a zoo
4
Without a doubt, most of the dishes here taste good. Certainly not the best but it is delicious. As it's a tourist spot, the cost of a meal is pricey. Depending on the dish, the serving can be alot. Good to try at least once for a taste around nature. Ambience is excellent
4
This restaurant inside the zoo is a fastfood restaurant.They served popular dishes in Singspore such as laksa, nasi lemak, chicken rice, or indian curry.We ordered their nasi lemak with chicken, nasi lemak with fish, and biryani with curry chicken.The portion is good, flavorful, and its on the spicy side if you like it spicy. In general, their food is quite good. The only drawback is the fact that it is overpriced, you can find better food and pay cheaper in most hawker centers
5
It may seem pricey as you then have to pay for your zoo entry but the food is very good.The orangutans are just mesmerising- they are so well behaved and funnyMake sure you book early, eat before 09:30 as my boys weren't interested in eating after the orangutans arrived! Well worth every penny!
4
$20 got us 2 nasi lemak which was filling and tasty. I can certainly recommend this place as a break point as you travel through the zoo
3
Nice seating area with interesting Ah Meng exhibition. Nice and courteous staff. Decent sandwiches. Not cheap.
Access to good and clean restrooms.
4
We have choose to eat there as they was serving indonesian food. the food was good but no spicy at all. maybe because of children eating there. also cannot eat outside so it is ac cold inside that make the food cold fast.
4
We visited the restaurant as part of breakfast with the orang-utans. The first thing to note was an apparent lack of organisation at the start of the breakfast. the meal itself was adequate, but with a little more organisation could have been better. One got the feeling that there was a desire for quantity rather than quality when it came to this event
1
Order one set of chicken rice and one set of indian Naan + curry chickenBoth taste bluntly.The chicken rice - The sauce is too salty like sea water !The chicken is cold with some blood water. The chef should be fired.The Indian naan - The naan is OK. The curry chicken is disappointed.It costs me $35 for two sets of meals with drinks.Honestly, I don't think Ah Meng will love the food served here.My advise - Go for KFC. Stay away from this pricey restaurant for tourist
3
The food was great and such a wonderful experience getting up close, but it did feel a little touristy not being allowed to interact with the animals although it's obvious why. Still worth doing, but the trip was a bit quick to see it all properly.
5
How could it be anyting but 5 stars. The food was very good with great variety for all. The orangutans were wonderful! Never did I think I was have breakfast with them and have my photo taken with them. Be advised there is NO barrier between you and the Orangutans. They are right there with you. Is made us a little nervous but what a great experience
4
We had both brackfast, with the Orangotans, and lunch here. The food for breakfast was ok, buffet so there was quite a bit of variety but obviously made quickly in large quantities. The reason to do brakfast is to get close to the oragotans who sit in their space in the restaurant. You can get close for a photo and watch them eat, but obviously they require a degree of separation from the public. The food at lunch was of a similar quality, quick and convenient
5
We had expected that they could seat with us, feed them or has the freedom to roam around with us during breakfast It is so sad why would Indonesia destroy their ecosystemin exchange for money and palm oil plantation that eventually lead the destruction of the habitats of the orangutans and other exotic animals.
4
This is one good options to sit relax and munch on within the zoo with the animals. They have limited bu good options to try. Chineese, indian, Lion city famous and american fries and dishes. We took laksa soup with baked chciken and noodles. The cost is also reasonable around 18-20 sing dollars and the food is also tasty. I saw they have full meal or buffet thing as well but we were certainly not in a mood to had that much
5
Amazing. Great food. Great experience. Book early online for best position as it gets very busy for the breakfasts. Lots of photo opportunities and information from the keepers.
4
Great prices, centrally located within the main zoo, and lots of food choices. I loved the steamed chicken, great value for $10!
4
Great to see the majestic animals up close. Very rushed though, tour company did not get us to the venue until just before the Orangutans appeared. Hence very rushed and not relaxed.
5
After the long walk nothing can refresh you more than a chilled coconut water or the freshly prepared mixed fruit juice. Go for the $7 chilled coconut juice and you will not be disappointed.
4
I believe this is the first restaurant in the zoo and has limited but good options. The is spacious and serves 4 varieties of food and each variety has 3-4 options. We took mee goren with baked chicken. It was really superb specially the baked chicken. Lot of people were having fish n chips or chicken chips as well. This was a good one
3
This is one of the poorest managed/least well organised cafes I've ever eaten at, and this is a shame, given that it is situated at a tourist hot-spot... Singapore Zoo.It appears to be a 'grab a tray, place an order, pay the cashier at the end' arrangement, but there are no signs to indicate this, and when I tried it, it didn't work. In the end I called a table clearer over and he went behind the counter to arrange my order, which included an iced coffee (Kopi). I received my food order plus a hot coffee, I explained that I didn't order this and they replaced it with an Iced Chocolate, which I accepted rather than going through the entire process again.By the way, such is the disorder of this place, I noticed at least 3 people receive their food order and proceed directly to a table without paying. I tried to tell the cashier and she waved me aside. The food by the way (Curry Laksa and Chicken/Rice) was pretty good, otherwise I'd only give it 2 stars
5
We made a reservation a month ago, just to make sure we got a chance to experience the atmosphere. We enjoyed the breakfast so much, variety of choices, very lovely orang utans and great MC as well. PS: u provide your credit card info is just to confirm your booking online, nothing will be charged before arrival, u still need to pay 35sgd on the spot.
3
The restaurant is at the centre of the excellent Singapore Zoo so is readily accessible when you are visiting. We ate a late lunch, hoping to avoid the inevitable crowds that such attractions have. We entered the food hall part of Ah Meng first but it was so crowded and chaotic that we quickly left. Fortunately, the adjacent bistro part of the restaurant provided a haven of relative calm with good food choices and no problems finding a table. The food was good for this type of restaurant in a major attraction and served the purpose to keep the 'wolf from the door'. While we were eating, a peacock wandered into the bistro, did a tight circuit of our table, then walked out again! Prices were too unreasonable, given the lack of other choices
5
We arrived into Singapore from Trivandrum(India) on 23 December 2016 at 7AM, and drove straight to this famed zoo as we had a 'Jungle breakfast' appointment at the Ah Meng restaurant with the Orangutans. Had also ensured to purchase the Zoo tickets with Tram in advance so that we could hop on and off, and didn't have to walk as the little blokes(my small sons) would tire away easily. The breakfast experience with the orangutans was incredibly impressive, and since we arrived circa 8:30AM after storing the big bags in the lockers we were super hungry too and took a place next to the rope. Overall, a phenomenal experience which would be etched in our memories for a long time- this was our 1st attraction and our alacrity to witness other major Singapore attractions was multiplied
3
Like most restaurants attached to major atttractions, there is a degree of inflated prices going on. We had to wait in a queue to be served because there was only one server on for a huge four sided counter. Appetite had worn off by then. This explains why we saw many families with packed lunches and snacks
3
The restaurant is like a junior food court with a few limited cuisines and food choices. The veggie options are limited in the Indian section, but they give a good veggie biryani plate which is quite filling for one person.
4
As a restaurant within a zoo, you would of course be excepting a premium on food and this place is no exception.
3
Since they dont have many options in veg we settled for a Ice milk tea in Souvenir cup. The drink was very nice and the cup too. Its very crowded and service can improve.
4
Buffet style breakfast with usual offerings. Informative talk and photo opportunity with the furry friends. Pleased we went. Zoo has plenty to offer also.
4
Spent breakfast with the kids and wildlife. Good experience food was plentiful and plenty of time to see the Orangutan's. Agree with the earlier comments about the quality of the photos - for $25 quality could be much much better.
5
wasn't lucky enough to eat while the orangutans were there but none the less the food was still great and service was done with style.
4
At AMR, you can have breakfast here which comes with a photo opportunity with the orang utans. Always exciting is watching the orang utans make their way to the photo platform. The host does his or her little animal presentation then invites the crowd to come take photos. I am quite sure that once they mentioned that this is the only place where you can take photos with the orang utans but I have chanced upon 2 other photo taking opportunities elsewhere in the zoo. Foodwise, it's a typical breakfast spread with western and asian dishes. nothing to write home about but good to fill up before your long day at the zoo. Service is quick and polite but the maÃ®tre d' can be a little fierce :DReservations highly highly recommended, although I've been lucky enough to not be turned away.They also serve food during lunch. Now there is a deli counter with salads and sandwiches (they look and taste good) and there are more selections inside. Gets very crowded very quickly, so try to avoid the lunch rush. The place also closes at 4pm. Food is at typical tourist attraction prices but not horribly eye-gouging as you still get a good and tasty meal
3
I think I expected more interaction but it was basically a buffet breakfast followed by a short talk by the keeper and then a photo opportunity in front of the orangutans. I know they are wild creatures but perhaps if they could call it breakfast with the "animals" then we could have other animals there who can be handled and have greater interaction. Even if a member of the audience had the opportunity to put food out for them it would have been better. We could use tongs so the food is not contaminated. It was lovely to see them up close nevertheless and the keeper was informative and did a good job as did the photographers
3
Reasonably tasty breakfast, nicely organised show, cute orang utans, all should be fantastic. Unfortunately, the linchpin of the experience, a photo with orang utans, is very badly designed. Their platform is positioned in a way so that both you and the animals are photographed straight against the sun. Any aspiring photographer knows that this is the easiest way to get pictures of appalling quality. Which they were. And they have their professional looking photographer on hand, happily snapping away and then selling you these photos
4
With not much options for vegetarians to have a good proper meal, we found Ah Meng's vegetarian biryani as a godsend. It was mild (perfect for kids), filling (good amount) and tasty. The biryani components were separate - fragranced rice, the aloo gobi, the raita and papad. Would recommend it to indian vegetarians for sure
1
I guess you can't ask too much for the food court. Ah Mee is no more. Food is very ordinary. If you want to fill your stomach in the zoo. That is probably your only choice. Otherwise I would stay clear from it
4
Arrived about 9 45 didn't miss much the monkeys were only out for 30 mins had photos with them only missed the talk. Buffet breakfast plenty of it staff soon came and cleared tables once it got to 10 20 .not that expensive
5
With the rains outside it was a wonderful experience
food was awesome and that come straight from a vegetarian
but be sure that you get the nearest seat to orangutans
4
I had the pleasure of dining here when visiting the Zoo for breakfast with the Orangutans. A large buffet with plenty of dishes to suit both Western and local tastes, and very tasty. Can be a little bit noisy, but was well organised. Plenty of space. Lovely view of the Orangutans
1
Was looking forward to this tour, started off ok, picked up at hotel 08:00 am, bang on time, shuttle bus to main pickup point where we had to wait for other travellers and the bus, this took us to around 08:50 am , 25 mins to the zoo, on the bus we were informed that we would have to be back at zoo pick up point by 11:40 am, so was at the zoo by around 09:25 am where we had to wait around again for the tour guide to organise entry tickets, that was another 15 mins. Once in we went to the dining area, breakfast was not too bad with plenty of choices, there were 4 Orangutans sitting sadly on a log, not really near where we were having breakfast so in my view we never got to have "Breakfast with the Orangutans". there was a considerable line to have photos taken with them, by the time we had finished breakfast we only just scraped in for a pic.I personally think this tour is almost falsely advertised. Regards, Paul & Julie Evans Western Australi
3
This was such an exciting experience to be this close to orangutans.malthough the breakfast was more than adequate, let's face it, you're not really there for the food!You got to line up to have your photo taken with the orangutans. I wasn't happy with my photo so lined up again as there weren't a lot of people there. We booked ahead, but there were plenty of tables available if you just turned up on the day.This is an experience you really must have. I absolutely loved it
5
Yes it was very touristy - but what a fun thing to do!We were surprised and excited to get to the restaurant and find there was only a rope barrier between our table and theirs, and it really was just a glorified photo opportunity, but we all really enjoyed the whole experience.Breakfast was really just an aside, but it was well catered and there was plenty for everyone. It included cooked, continental and Asian options presented buffet style
4
Arrived late which was my fault, but we were fortunate enough to catch 15 minutes before it closed. There looked to have been a fairly substantial array of breakfast food but, again because it was my fault, most of it was only lukewarm. However we got a couple of good shots with the orangutans, which made it worthwhile. Please please give yourself lots of time to get here if you're travelling via the mrt and then the bus.
5
Ah Meng Restaurant opens at 10am. It has different options to choose from. Malay cuisines, Chinese, Noodle counter, Western dishes and Tandoori section. There's only 1 option for vegetarian dish and you can have it at tandoori section with Briyani rice or Naan if you are going to visit on Fridays, weekends and Singapore National Holiday
3
We ate at Ah Meng Restaurant as part of the "Breakfast with the Orangutans". The foods offered was buffet style and all in place as we were seated, so eggs, and other hot foods were only warm. We felt it was a little disappointing but perhaps had been spoilt by the breakfasts that had enjoyed at our hotel. We cannot comment on food provided at other times. Note that when attending Breakfast with the Orangutans, you cannot choose where you sit, you are shown to your designated seat
3
As you would expect food and drinks at the zoo are exorbitantly priced. The food quality and taste is just about average. There are some good options, especially in the Malay and Chinese cuisine and ice-creams. The rest is just avoidable.
3
Beautiful setting in the middle of the restaurant. But the price is that of a cafeteria serving factory style food. Rather pack your own lunch and have a picnic in the beautiful grounds.
4
The buffet is pretty good with lots of options. There are also good drink options too. But the food is secondary to the experience!
Book early to get the best seats.
4
Dine here with family. Food price was ok. 9.90 for Laksa or Nasi Lemak. Food not bad. Drinks slightly overpriced. Usual since this is in the attraction area.
5
The Vegetarian platter with a really thick Naan, Dal, Subji, and a Raitha was boon in middle of the Singapore Zoo. The quality of food was excellent especially in the place predominating with non-vegetarian food. The service was excellent in the overcrowded lunch hour. Our trip to the Zoo was made more memorable by the tasty food served to us when least expected.
2
After having a lovely morning at the zoo, we stopped at this restaurant for lunch. I had braised duck and yam rice set, it was cold and tasted disgusting like it was leftovers from the day before. The service was also poor. My partner had nuggets and chips and they were slightly better but still not of an acceptable standard for an establishment such as this, we did enjoy the fruit platter though. I definitely would not go back or recommend. Very disappointing Singapore Zoo
2
$10 for a hawker food is too expensive, the chicken rice I got was also pre made and cold. One staff attending to 2 booths is very hard to manage.Drinks are also expensive but good for value, at least it's not diluted unlike some parks
5
Restaurants at popular attractions are seldom satisfying. It's either overpriced or underflavored. Good thing Singapore Zoo's Ah Meng Restaurant, named in honor of its famous Orang-Utan is neither. The menu items are reasonably-priced and the food are tasty enough, you won't feel shortchanged it's the only resto inside the massive Singapore Zoo grounds. Best to go there early or late since it does get packed despite the size
3
We combined the River Safari and Night Safari in one day and needed something to eat in between. We had food at the Ah Meng Restaurant just before the entrance to the zoo and river safari. We didnâ€™t think prices were too bad considering. I had a laksa and he had nasi lemak. Cool drinks were expensive so we decided to get two bottles of coke from the vending machine which seemed ever so slightly cheaper. The food itself was fine, my laksa was ok, maybe lacking in a bit of depth and flavour but nothing to really complain about. There were other options of places to eat, we just chose one and ordered
4
I did the whole breakfast with the orangutans thing and the food then was pretty good, just like a breakfast you would get at any of the halfway decent hotels around here and that is nothing to sneeze at.No idea what it would be like any other part of the day
4
The food here is good, Vegetarians like us get an option too. The spread is lil limited for vegetarians but it's at-least available ! Try the Coconut water its refreshing ! The place is affordable !
5
I ate up the food with zeal. Inside there we can view visitors taking photos with the animals. It is animal friendly place.
4
Ate here for breakfast with the orangatang and it was a clean and complete breakfast. Lots of choice and well managed. I'd recommend this restaurant. It looks like they are close to opening a new one alled the same name.
3
Singapore Zoo入口前のFood courtの中の店舗です。Laksaなどのlocal foodがSGD10以下の値段で提供されており、動物園の食堂の中では安価な方でしょうか。
3
The casual and cosy atmosphere of this place is also perfect for relaxing and enjoying meals like chicken rice, fish & chips and briyani. The queue is very long (especially during lunchtime at CNY). They need to improve their queuing system!
5
We visited the Ah Meng restaurant -- it's more like a cafeteria actually -- inside the Singapore Zoo. They have several counters with a variety of cuisines. We had laksa, and chicken nuggets for the kids. Both were very nice. The location is very convenient right next to a tram stop in the zoo
4
If you have been walking and enjoying the view of the animals through the morning then this is the place to take your break for lunch or snacks.The restaurant is well located inside the Zoo. Easy to find it and with a good selection of food.We took lunch there and were happy with the portions and the preparation. Having into account that Singapore is an expensive city, the prices in Ah Meng are correct. We really loved the fresh juices stand. They have a selection of healthy mixed fruits or simply the plain fresh fruit juices. The place was clean despite the amount of people that were there having lunch. Do not expect a high cuisine restaurant or a Michelin one of course, but you will not be dissapointed

We booked this breakfast prior to leaving Australia online, but didnâ€™t pay till the day. You have to purchase a ticket to the zoo as well as to have the breakfast! You can pay with cash or credit card on entry We were greeted and seated promptly If you arrive for opening 8.30 (like we did) you'll get to enjoy the breakfast before the Orang-utans come outLots of choice, the buffet breakfast selection is huge, with Asian and western style foods and also another table with fruits and drinksThere was plenty of good quality food which was replenished quickly  About 9.30 the Orang-utans come down from the trees one by one for their breakfast. A staff member talked about them, their relations, their habits etc. In the meantime you can queue up to take pictures. When it's your turn they take a professional picture and also one with your device so you have 1 picture for free! The professional can be bought in a package with a printed big picture, a keying picture and a fridge magnet the cost is S$35 our kids had a few turnsThey are very close to restaurant but you must keep about a meters distance.Overall it is really fun experience,the kids loved it and are still talking about itThis was a highlight of our Singapore stop over, highly recommended the kids favourite

Book in advance and arrive in time! The restaurant is big but it filled up completely by time. If you arrive for opening (like we did) you'll get the closest tables to the monkeys! You can pay with cash or credit card for the event on the spot.The buffet breakfast selection is huge with a long table with Asian and another one with western style foods and also another table with fruits and drinks! We ate from the Asian table and found everything awesome!Later the monkeys were led to their place near the people. A nice lady talked about them, their relations, their habits etc. And in the meantime you can queue up to take pictures. When it's your turn they make a professional picture and one with your device which you give them (phone, your camera etc.) so you have 1 picture for free! The professional can be bought in a package with a printed big picture, a keyring picture and a fridge magnet which is NOT you picture just about the monkeys. It costs 35 S$.Don't have high expectations, you can't touch the monkeys, they won't sit next to you. They have their place very close to restaurant but you must keep a few meters distance. But in overall it is really fun experience

Now the only reason I had breakfast at Ah Meng was for the orangutan experience. It was different from what I was anticipating, but good all in all.The buffet spread was okay, though there was ample variety, I wouldn't suggest this place for the breakfast especially at the cost!Once the orangutans are let into their breakfast area, touching the restaurant dining area (it's a semi open restaurant), an excited employee starts educating the crowd about the orangutans, their habits, their names, etc. The guests can form a que and get snapped with the orangutans. The que moves swiftly, the restaurant employees take your photos from your phone / camera for you and so does a professional photographer there, who would later show your snap to you in case you like it, you may buy on the spot. We were happy with the photos they took with our mobile cameras for us. You can't really feed, touch or play with the orangutans. It's just being really close to them. It's a different, fun experience nevertheless

We had breakfast with the Orangutans and the range of food was very good.
Lots to suit both Asian and Western tastes.
Overall a good experience and one to recommend.
5
Had breakfast here with the orangutans. We had stunning food with a wide variety of ffod. We left with full tummies. Worth it
3
Prices are almost double compared to other food court located in up market shopping centre. You will be better off to bring your own food. Food choices are very limited and the taste very average.
4
Huge queue for hainan chicken but others were fine too so had others instead of waiting in a queue. Taste not bad for fast food inside a zoo.
3
Its only place where you can have lunch in Singapore Zoo. They serve variety of set menus, including indian, halal food. Its not very expensive as well.
4
For food at a zoo...or any attraction really, there is a good choice of cuisines at an attractive price. Choices are limited in the Zoo but this does fine.

Had been there for breakfast with orangutans. I have never seen orangutans this close. They were cute and friendly.Amazing experienceThey can probably make the orangutans meet and breakfast as two different event. The buffet spread is large but Vegetarians will actually starve.Except fruits and one chewy paratha (with no side dish) , there is nothing to eat for a vegetarian, even the bread has eggs. Unfourtunately we had no other restaurants nearby so had to come here for lunch expecting something to eat. There was a single biryani option that not tasting that great.Indian veggies visiting Singapore zoo are strongly advised to bring some veg food from home or get parcels from Ananda Bhavan singapore. Ananda bhavan serves packed veg indian food for picnics . We did that for the jurong bird park and saved our souls
5
I am not sure whether it was the weather or the iced tea was really good. Every visit to the zoo, I would get my iced tea from this restaurant. It really helped me to cool down from the heat and it always tasted so good that one glass was not enough
3
If you're visiting the zoo for gourmet dining, this is not the place for you. It is a cafeteria, with 5 or 6 food stations and a central cashier. The food was fine, but nothing special. Pries were fair. Recommend you stake out a table before getting food lest it get cold whilst you wait for one while carrying a tray of food and beverages
3
This restaurant gets really crowded so try to eat there outside of regular eating times to avoid the scrum. You can get a variety of food and drink both Western and Asian. We had the laksa and it was okay but not the best one we had in Singapore. Fortunately the prices are reasonable. They are not as cheap as you can find in hawker centres but not ridiculously expensive tourist prices. I think it cost us about $12 or so for a main meal and a drink. It is a typical self-service place where you line up, order your food and then pay at the checkout
4
Try the curry duck. It is yummy. A short walk from the entrance. Plentiful toilets nearby. We hopped up the night safari tram outside the restaurant.
1
We try this restaurant when we visiting the Zoo. The restaurant is inside of Singapore Zoo. The food is quite OK for filling your hungry stomach while visiting the zoo.
4
We had lunch here while visiting the Singapore Zoo. It was very very busy, the food was Ok, the price was Ok, the service was Ok.
4
We visited this restaurant for Breakfast with the Orangutans.
The buffet had a great variety of food and it was of very good quality. The service was also very efficient.
3
Variety of food to accommodate all backgrounds. Laksa is quite soft. You have to add a lot of chili to the the reel taste. But was good for this kind of places
3
Good selection of food but a bit pricey. Try to avoid going at lunch time because the place is very busy.
4
We loved the traditional food served on banana leaves and the large servings with protein, rice and salad for only $9. They had spicy or bland varieties for all tastes. The fish noodle soup was great too even on a hot day. Service was prompt and there were plenty of tables to choose from at lunchtime on a weekday.
4
Not to be confused with the Ah Meng Kitchen outside the Zoo. This one is in the park. There is something to cater for everyone's taste, the restaurant serves both Western and Eastern dishes, meat and veg options. There is seating both inside or out. Freshly cooked and very tasty and at a reasonable price. Don't get caught out as the restaurant closes at 4pm
4
We had a very nice lunch here. Although it was very busy the service was quite good. I had a chicken and rice curry which was very fresh and tasty. The restaurant has a canteen-style about it with help yourself trays and the food was much fresher and better than you would think
2
You don't really have many alternatives when visiting Singapore Zoo for the day. This place gets extremely busy on weekends around lunchtime and you can end up waiting a long time to get your food, the taste of which is really not great. Condition your expectations to minimise dissatisfaction
3
Ah Meng is your option out of not too many options at Singapore Zoo. Although it has a variety of local foods, I find it a little pricey, but not that you would find anything dirt cheap, in and around there
1
My husband and I ordered the chicken breast meal and could not finish it. The restaurant smelled really bad as well. We had to eat outside. Pity because the zoo was awesome.
3
Typical hawker food and slightly overpriced. The drinks are pricy and seating limited. What a pity there is no place here or anywhere in Singapore zoo to re-fill water.
2
The food we were served was bland and greasy. All the food is precooked and kept in food warmers. If it's not a curry , it's deep-fried. It was one of the worst meals we had in Singapore and we weren't even expecting much.
5
The nasi lemak and laksa were really good. Very homely and original taste. I am always looking forward to go the Singapore Zoo so we can have breakfast at this restaurant. Nasi lemak cost you about SGD$9.90
5
Great food , fresh , coffee , eggs , cheeses , pastries , juices all good and very good value . Try and book so you can see the monkey breakfast .
3
Good for breakfast to see the orangutans , and to see some other animals up close. Not cheap but worth doing if your visiting
3
The stopover at Tram Station 2, amongst others for your dose of breakfast, lunch, supper etc. This is the main restaurant inside the zoo and what it does is offer meals (and not a-la carte menu items) across various cuisine categories - Singaporean, Oriental, Western and Indian.You need to take the food trays and then pay for it. I had taken the Indian category food - veg meal which had biryani, yellow dal, some veggies and yogurt. Fairly basic and expensive, about SGD 11.50 per meal. But that is the way with food sold inside all attractions including the drinks. This year owing to the 50 year celebrations, 2 500 ml bottles are sold for SGD 
5
This is the second time we have had breakfast at the zoo and we weren't disappointed. We booked prior to leaving Australia, it sure if this makes a difference. We were greeted and seated promptly, this time a little away from the feeding area, but not disappointed. We could see the Orangutans come down from the trees one by one for their breakfast and were able to get to the front easily enough for a good view. On our first visit they brought out several different animals, but this time just the Orangutangs. There was plenty of food which was replenished quickly. The only "down" thing was that there was no real bacon . Understand the issue with Islams and Pork, but we felt all races should be catered for
3
We eat chicken rice set and chicken nugget with fries. Taste so so and really expensive.Chicken rice served with veggie and soup but we add on some braised tofu and egg as the portion seems not very filling.Chicken nugget and fries also taste so so and portion is not very fillin
4
If you need to have a quick meal before you enter the zoo this restaurant gives you some oriental options. Self service and I would not say well priced. But good quantities and the taste is palatable.
4
Stopped off here for a late lunch & very welcome break in between Orangutan feeding times. Good selection of authentic local style foods even as late as 4pm. Surprisingly well priced too.
5
We enjoyed the selection of foods for breakfast, both hot and cold. Being so close to the orangutas was great!
1
We were a group of 7 and ordered different dishes They were all bland. We should have eaten in the KFC restaurant in the zoo instead.
3
too less quantity of food compared to the energy required to roam about in the zoo. only one option for vegetarians. coffee was awesome!
4
We were seated in a prompt manner at the table closest to where the orangutans sit whilst you eat. The spread was decent enough and I left feeling satisfied. The price was extremely reasonable given how long the orangutans were actually out for. I got some amazing shots and it was truly a highlight of our stay in Singapore. I expected more disorder amongst the guests seeing as it was the Lunar New Year celebrations, but everyone respected the guidelines set out by the zoo staff.If I find myself in Singapore on a stopover again, I will be here for breakfast, not for the food per se but for the fact that my favourite animal is at arms length from me. Any animal lover will love this experience. Also, take your booking reference number with you so they can locate your reservation quicker. Enjoy

So I booked this experience for my hubby and I for my birthday. Turning 29 and I thought this would be a good way to start the year.The experience of seeing the orangutans, the keeper talking and general set up is great. What isn't great is the breakfast. Beef bacon should not be allowed - especially cold beef bacon. And everything else was clearly out of a packet or cooked to within an inch of its life. There was a huge selection so you can find something but for the cost of over $30 they need to raise their game. Also $35 for the photo and keyring thing is expensive. They are good and will happily take a photo for you on your own camera, phone etc.The actual zoo is amazing and I'll write a seperate review. Basically do the breakfast if you want to get close to the orangutans but don't expect a great breakfast

Very busy cafeteria-style restaurant located right across the elephant ride area inside Singapore Zoo. We had lunch here on Dec 12. We ordered fish & chips ($11.90), chicken cutlet with fries ($11.90) and rice ($1/cup). Overall, food was palatable, a little pricey but hardly a surprise as this place caters to tourists. There were 4 of us in our group, 2 of us went to order food while the other 2 reserved a table. We queued up at the leftmost counter thinking it was just one long line from food to drinks only to be told that, as there are separate counters serving different cuisines (Malaysian, Indian, Western, etc), you only need to line up at the food you want. Then you head to the cash register to pay and get your table napkins. As you eat and look around you would see framed pictures of the late Ah Meng, the celebrity orang utan the restaurant was named after.When you're done you clear the table and put away your trays on a designated rack
3
The cost I guess is more for the fact that you can get close to the orang-utans but they weren't interactive. We didn't get there until 9 and the hot dishes weren't hot. The buffet consisted of some cereals, pastries, toast, eggs, omelette, hash browns, curry, noodles, beef bacon, baked beans, juice and tea and coffe

This Restaurant is located near the entrance of Singapore Zoo, next to Safari Scoops. It is quite a spaceous eatery place with a casual and cosy atomosphere. After a long walk at the Zoo, visitors will stop here for food and short rest.They are opened at 10am to 4pm on Monday to Friday. They served Asian Food such as their signatuare dish is the Nasi Lemak. They also have fried bee hoon, laksa, crispy fried snacks, Hainese Chicken Rice (SGD9.80), Chicken Chops(SGD11.90) and Cutlets (SGD11.90), Fish and Chips, Indian Briyani, Curry, Hot and Cold Drinks, etc.The hot and cold drinks are priced at between SGD2.30 to SGD4.90 per serving.Most of the foods were prepared before hand at individual counters, therefore, the Hainese Chicken Rice that I have ordered was cold, the vegetables and soups were cold too. I was quite disappointed at the cold food as Chicken Rice is my top favourite dish.Young children will like their chicken chops and cutlets, which comes complete with fries.The pricing of the food and drinks are on the high side, but since you are there, you dont mind the prices.The crowds started to form while we are dining, as it was also raining outside.Visitors also tried to take shelter in the restaurant

Spacious tropical setting with super service and value for money. Buffet breakfast with everything you want, fresh, well laid out.
4
The food's delicious coupled with the atmosphere surrounded by trees and the animals right in the zoo itself! We can eat and watch the chimps swinging up in the trees at the same time. We would love to eat there again.
3
We only had coffee and cold drinks so can't comment on food although food looked good. It was a very pleasant place to take a short rest while touring the zoo.
3
I had the worst fish n chips here, but my husbands nasi lemak was excellent. Recommend the ice tea as well, very refreshing.
5
We had breakfast with the orangutans. Breakfast was a buffet with fruit, western and Asian food choices. You have to purchase a ticket to the zoo to have the breakfast. And it's two separate reservations, they can't be booked together.
5
It was great to finally see "ONE" vegetarian option available at one of Singapore's attractions and that too at their Indian counter. It was reasonably good fare too, saffron rice, dal, curry and curd. Thank god for Ah Meng, else we would have had to go back without lunch from the Zoo too
5
We arrived early to get our pre booked table. We watched the elephants bathing just around the corner and then sat down to a very nice buffet style breakfast. Not exciting but plenty of choice, helpful staff and good coffee. We had just finished as the orang-utans arrived for their own breakfast. This was the highlight of our day. I resisted the opportunity to pose with them as I was just fascinated watching their interaction with each other. What a privilege to be so close to them. Thankyo

Nasi lemak here is great, big portion. Small eater can share it for two.The price is a bit expensive for nasi lemak, but looking at the portion and the location, is consider quite reasonable in Singapore.Self service restaurant, everything is made to order, the food and drinks are good
5
We had a breakfast. There was many type of food, like fruits, pan, cake..... There was fresh juice too. The breakfast starts at 9 AM and ends at 11 AM. About 9:30 AM the staff call orangutans family which also has a breakfast. You can make photo with them and you can make a photo with snake. It was the best birthday breakfast in my life

Ah Meng was a famous orangutang in Singapore Zoo. She would turn in her grave if she knew what kind of food they are serving in her restaurant, at least during a buffet time.If you are not desperately hungry and your children are not starving, do not go. There was a KFC outside the zoo and although IÂ´m not a fan I would definitely go there this time
