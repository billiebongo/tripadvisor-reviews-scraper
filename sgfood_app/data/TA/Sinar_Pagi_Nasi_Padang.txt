I don't understand the overall positive review of this place. It says enough when the chili was the best part of the meal. Wouldn't recommend it, though if you just need to refuel; can.

A bit saucy, more rice would've been good. Recommend u come here before noon or in the afternoon as neighbouring corporates come here for lunch and queue is long.

Very good Nasi Padang, a lot of options. My colleague who was visiting singapore for a week said this was the best he eat during his visit.

Lunch crowd starts from 11:45am so be prepared to stay in line if you arrive around that time. I chose to always arrive there earlier. The dishes are authentic Padang dishes (please don't be mistaken with the usual Malay cuisine you get as authentic Padang dishes). The staff are friendly and fast at serving. The lime juice really compliments the food. All the dishes are super-licious but I personally love the deng-deng sapi (beef jerky), sotong masak hitam (squid in black sauce), sup ekor (ox-tail soup) and tahu telor (tofu omelette). Price is a litte expensive compared to typical food you get at malay stalls but it's worth every penny

Great Padangnese food. The dishes are not oily and the taste really hits your taste buds. Lots of dishes to choose from. One of the best Nasi Padang stall in Singapore. Try to come early as the queue is quite long during lunch hour. You have been warned! Lol

Love the food here. BBQ chicken, fried chicken, sambal, eggs, spicy fried veg like kang Kong and eggplant, served with rice on banana leaf. A must try if you want to experience Malay food here. Admittedly, it doesn't come cheap when compared to food court or hawker centre. If you come during lunch hour, be prepared to queue as you need to compete with office workers from CBD

The food here is very local and authentic and tastes incredible. There is not much in the way of atmosphere but that doesn't matter as the food makes up for it. The staff are friendly and happy to serve you. I really enjoyed all the accompanying sauces too

After all these years, they have remained faithful to their recipes. Their dishes are authentic and the different flavors associated with each different dish makes it a memorable eating experience For example, their assam fish, fried chicken and sambal kangkong makes 3 different taste and aromas very distinct yet when combined together with plain rice explodes with a mouth watering experience. Wholeheartedly and highly recommended. Expect a long queue during lunch hours of 12pm - 2pm

When you miss real Padang foods, look no further, just swing your way to Sinar Pagi Nasi Padang.Rendang, sayur lodeh, sayur nangka, and that green chilli, wowFirst time trying Grilled curry chicken, above my expectation, meat was tender n cooked Perfectly.Beef lungs had always been my Hubby's favorite.

Having been to this restaurant for quite a while, a review is somewhat necessary, though late. Occupying an entire shophouse along Circular Road, this place has a queue forming during lunch. To beat the lunch crowd, do try to be there before 12 noon. Nevertheless, there should be ample seating as it does occupy all 3 levels of the shophouse. The selection is fairly typical of nasi padang stalls, and we keep ordering the fried chicken, patai, tauhu telur, curry chicken, and beef rendang. The food is indeed tasty, and the quality consistent. However, do note that the meal is on the pricier side.
