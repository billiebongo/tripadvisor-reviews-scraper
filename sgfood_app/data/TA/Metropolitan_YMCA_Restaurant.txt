Nice newly renovated cafe with good quality food. Very enjoyable experience. Wallet friendly too! Recommended!

Food pacing was lacking. Order status inquiries with waithelps were regarded nonchalantly. Rstaruant was not running at full capacity. Poor excuse for slow food service.

Had our meal almost on a daily basis from 8-18 Nov 2017 and there is always something that intrigues us. Great service and interesting selection!

The breakfast is very rich in variety, I ate everyday but i don't feel boring. And the dinner is also very good, the type of food is very rich too.

good for big groups as it is not very crowded on weekends and location wise more central for everyone. food is average. air conditioning very strong - it was really cold inside + it was a rainy day.

We enjoyed numerous meals at this restaurant and they were all of very good quality and reasonably priced. Would certainly recommend to visitors.

Nice ambience and great service.Friendly staff. We tried the highly recommended Curry Fish Head and it was pretty tasty. Fish is fresh and with lots of gravy. Great with jasmine rice.However another chef recommendation - the Salted Egg Yolk Prawn was a great disappointment. Seems their top sellling dish is the Claypot Rice. We did not try it but it does smell very fragrant.Had great conversation with staff Kay

Came with a few friends for dinner specifically to try out the local food. We were pleasantly surprised to find such value for money and such homely food. The environment was also great for us to catch up over dinner and dessert. Do try out these dishes which we shared. There are also some cool drinks to try out like the Passionfruit with Soursop drink and Organic Honey Lemon Drink

What is perfect for this hotel? The location! This hotel only 15 minutes walking from the mrt station and in front of this hotel there is a bus stop, so this hotel is really easy to find. We stayed here to watch coldplay concert in singapore,we stayed 31march -2aprilThe only problem with me is when we arrived and check in, we stayed at room 432, the room boy entered our room without knocking and we are so suprised because we just come and still changin our clothes,the room boy entered to give the bath ammenities, i call the front office and they are sorry for the inconvenient, that afternoon we go out to watch coldplay concert we tell the front office again about the room boy inccident, and after that again the say appologise, for us this is very serious incident and make us worries about Our safety in singapore

We only managed to have breakfast at the hotel. However the spread was adequate and the fried rice was quite good. They bake their own mini croissant which were delicious.We observed that they had group bookings for lunches and a few specialties listed in the menu.
