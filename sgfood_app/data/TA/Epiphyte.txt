The botanical theme of the restaurant, with terrariums and hanging potted plants, is refreshing. We came for the Instagram worthy desserts and were not disappointed. Each piece was exquisite and tasted rich but not cloying. May come back to try other items on the menu.

Nice ambiance and friendly owner. Good place to just hang out with friends. Enjoyed the food and really adore the dessert. Very non-commercial feeling.

The shop space is small with only 1 waiter but service is efficient and staff is friendly.We had burnt miso salmon and pink risotto and home made lemon lime tea. Salmon is half cook and has a good combination with yam cake. Miso taste is not strong but overall is good. Pink risotto has light taste of beetroot which is sweet, taste good when taken together with the salty salmon roe. Portion is also just nice for someone with small appetite

In the midst of the pubs along Neil road, Epiphyte Cuisine Bar has stood as an outstanding restaurant serving Asian-Western fusion cuisine.The starter Chicken Panko Satay makes the average Singaporean who is familiar with satay to long for more. It gives satay a new meaning. The three main courses are fascinating too.The tender Pomelo & Watermelon Pork Belly literally melts in your mouth. The pork belly goes so well with the refreshing watermelon.Try the Korobuta-Collagen Ramen if you love noodle. This combination is simply marvellous.The Wagyu Rump with the nice Curry Crumble is a must-try for those love steak.Do not fill your stomach with the main course. The desserts, like Vodka-Jelly Sorbet, is a wonderful end to the night's dinner.At the end of the wonderful dinner, I understand that the Head Chef is formerly from Ce La Vi restaurant.Tip: If I can only try one dish, and knowing what I know, I will recommend the Pomelo & Watermelon Pork Belly. (If you don't mind pork belly

Looking for a different place to chill out? Nice place for lunch or dinner on the ground. First floor bar are filled with nice decorations and colourful lightings! Overall friendly staff and fantastic menu to go with your main course or their signature desserts. Ask them for their wine recommendation and it's definitely worth to go with your meal. Enjoy!

Has become a firm favourite of mine for special occasions or a Sunday lunch. Usually for dinners we eat upstairs (this is more of a bar layout where downstairs is more restaurant feel. The food is just amazing, great interpretations on classic dishes. If you are a fish or seafood lover... Its a place to try out. Would recommend booking in advance esp. Thurs - Sunday so your not disappointed. Staff are very friendly

Very cosy place, fluffiest cheese cake, beautiful space cake (which wasn't as impressive as the cheese cake), cute terrarium (which is also not as memorable as the cheese cake). Very friendly staffs & no silly house rule of 1 person has to order 1 dish and 1 drink unlike some other places. We only had cakes and tea but will definitely try their famous beetroot risotto next time. Will definitely recommend

I am so happy that finally, gorgeous presented meals pared with delicious food is finally trending in Singapore. Epiphyte Singapore is one of those mouth-watering Michelin inspired restaurants where there are delicious meals presented in amazing presentation. The desserts are just incroyable, so beautiful to look at and yet so so delicious!The cafe/restaurant is on the ground level but there is a bar selling amazing alcoholic concoctions on the 2nd floor

The cafe is not big so booking may be wise.The cocktail was strong and not expensive at $15.The crab cakes were average, slightly dry.The pink risotto made with beetroot was quite good but a bit more cheese would make it excellent. At $22 with five seared fresh scallops it was inexpensive!The cakes were innovative and nice. Twilight had Cointreau and Eden was served with sake!Worth a revisit:

I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile, so the anticipation had been building. I am glad that it met my expectations. Besides the ambience and decor, I really like their pink risotto and desserts. I was told that they are reviewing their menu soon to include some "seasonal items", I look forward to my next visit! Would just like to add that some food blogs do not reflect their actual opening hours accurately but google is accurate!
