Delicious food and value for money. Staff are attentive and provide good service .Would recommend to others!
3
We ordered some rojak, satay and fried noodles, +drinks for a quick and easy meal.
Make sure to opt out of those crackers they'll bring, as they're chargeable and not particularly good.
4
When we have a craving for Penang food, example, Penang fried kway teow, Lor Bak or rojak, we will head to Penang culture. Pretty close to traditional Penang food.
5
Fast and Efficient in order taking.and food preparation, perfect for a rush meal for airport passengers.
3
Food was ok, However restaurant did not arrange for wheelchair convenient spot, even though during my booking my remark that there’s an elderly person with wheelchair. Service need to improve further.
4
Penang Culture is at the corner, yet easy to locate. Spacious to accommodate many patrons. Staffs are attentive. Love the Rojak, taste is great!
2
This place puts a basket of prawn crackers on your table as soon as you sit down. We asked is it free and they said no. Lucky we didn't start eating.By the end of our meal and time to pay they added Tax on top, very sneaky
4
We came here for a meal before our flight. The place was very simple with bright lighting like a food court.We ordered the prawn noodle soup, char kway teow and premium nasi lemak. The taste of the food was rather authentic. The ingredients used were fresh and of quality.If you are looking for simple Penang street food, this place fits the bill
4
The food is quite tasty and not that expensive at all. It can be quite spicy which depends on the individuals taste. We had a dish each and three drinks and it came to $35.00.The service could be a bit better as it wasnâ€™t that busy when we were there
4
Tables and chairs were ready when we arrived. Service staffs were polite and size of the dishes were fine. It will be even better if the restaurant have some round tables, as it was hard for us to share the dishes. Overall it was a pleasant experience.
4
The food was slow for an airport restaurant but the dishes when it finally arrived were pretty tasty and authentic.
3
Nasi lemak was not bad. Penang fried rice very spicy. We liked the salted egg mantis prawns the most.
3
Food is ok average but otah not fresh. Service is good even though they are full house and understaffed.
3
Just a quick meal in airport before our departure time. Still can't beat the real taste of Penang foods.
3
The Milo float is bland. The salted egg fried kueh tiao is not as wat we expected that creamy type but the hard boiled salted egg.
5
Restaurant can get a bit crowded at times but turnover is quite fast.
Food is yummy. Feel free to refuse the basket of crackers as it wld cost u extra.
Water station is self serve.
4
Penang hawker food in Changi. Wide selection of various flavours. Special National Day menu. Pop in. You won't be disappointed. Try the durian chendol.
4
I have visited Penang Culture for meals several times. I really enjoyed the oyster omelette and my Friend and I will always order this dish. The outlet at the airport can be quite crowded at times, especially when there are many departing flights. This restaurant has free flow of iced and lukewarm water available for customers who decide to drink water.
3
The place serves decent local Penang food but for its price, a tad expensive. On top of that, their service could be better improved. Menu items are self service written on a chit before the order is taken by the staff. When delivered, the staff does not even know who to serve it to, just simply passing it on to the nearest seated person they have reached. Even worse, especially when there are many items ordered, the staff does not return to check on whether all items have been served. I had to manually ask for my missing dishes to be served. Not worth the 10% service charge just to have my food order taken and for my dishes to be misdelivered.
3
We had a oyster omelette, otah and penang fried kway teow. The food was quite a disappointment as it tasted below average. The oyster were slightly cold and the penang fried kway teow was slightly salty. However the otah tasted not bad. But i doubt i would be back again
3
Prawn soup noodle is good, the appetize tofu with peanut souce is average. Price wise is ok and service is average.
3
Service is good. Waiting time is short. Food is average. No much comments. Just a very normal restaurant.
1
Ordered dishes and crackers came down we are some and then noticed these are charged unless you tell the staff you don't want them. Cheeky enough. Black pepper beef was horrible and Penang was just red oil. Avoid avoid avoid.
3
I have lunch with my family while waiting my flight .
Our food , chicken was very late coming. We should called twice and other foods almost done.
The taste was not I expected.
Waitress was good
5
Place is family friendly, not cramp, ok waiters and waitresses. Well lighted and comfortable. Family enjoy the food here. Most important of all, it is Halal certified, no beef. Safe for muslims and non muslims consumption. Located at T2 level 3. Thank God!

Our party of three, which included my elderly parents, ordered 3 items. They were the Penang Assam Laksa, Penang White Curry Noodles and Premium Lobster & Scallop Noodles together with drinks.While the Laksa Noodles was tasty, the White Curry Noodles was extremely salty. Even after rejecting it, the second portion served to us was the same and inedible.The biggest disappointment ws the Premium Lobster and Scallop Noodles. The scallop portion was acceptable but the Lobster portion was no more than a small sliver the size of smallest finger nail. The soup base was also not boiled enough and lacked the concentrated flavour of prawn & bone stock.We went there primarily because of the press reviews which had supposedly excellent ratings for the Premium Lobster & Scallops Noodles. Unfortunately we were left hugely disappointing !
3
For an airport eatery, I suppose the prices are reasonable. My Penang seafood laksa was not too bad but of course nothing compared to the real thing in Penang. The cendol was hopeless, just sweet and lacking in taste and flavour. The separate spicy eggplant dish was however quite good. All in all there wasn't such a variety of modestly priced restaurants to choose from. If you are stuck for choice, give this place a try. I may just have ordered the wrong dishes
4
We tried a few dishes. The Penang Asam Laksa is a must. The fried noodles range are good and taste very much like those you get in Penang, maybe slightly healthier. However, the cost is much higher. The drinks are nothing to laud - medium size and average tasting. The good service probably make up for the cost. Avoid meal times if you are really hungry
3
On the walls there are wonderful large photographs of old Penang and the menu promises an equally authentic experience. Some of the dishes, like the Sambal Sotong (cuttlefish in chilli sauce), we had were what you would get in Penang itself. Unfortunately, with the others it was impossible to discern the balance of flavours because they were all far too sweet. For example there was a staple - Sambal Kangkung (spicy water convolvulus) - which was drenched in sweet soy sauce. Even the fresh fruit drinks had so much sugar added that they were virtually undrinkable. Neither of us particularly averse to sugar, but independently we each decided to have no sugar for a couple of days to counteract the enforced overdose. If you are at all at risk from sugar overdose, avoid
4
My husband and I had our dinner at Penang Culture just before our departure. We had Penang Fried Kway Teow, Kway Teow Soup and Ice Kachang. We both liked the Ice Kachang as it was a good serving and perfect after a hot day shopping in Singapore. The service was a bit slow but the restaurant was busy at that time. We will come back for more
5
Definitely a yes to the Assam laksa! Not spicy, very flavourful with a tinge of sourness. The slices of pineapple gave an interesting sweet blend to it.
5
Very Good Penang food at Changi airport, one of the better eat in options if at the airport. Prices reasonable considering its the airport.
3
The food here was rather genuine, penang style. i liked the fried kuay teow and Prawn noodles.however at peak times, the service level was a let down. They did seem to be able to cope with fast pace of crowd coming in and out
4
We were looking for a place to dine in, and discovered this “Penang Culture” in NEX.Delighted, we ordered Penang Laksa, Prawn noodle, Rojak, ice-kacang & cendol.Whoa!The foods were great!Bring back memories of Penang.The restaurant was packed, and is Halal.Service is above average.Try it, if you love Penang street food.Enjoy
3
Service: Not all staff was able to speak English. When I approached a staff to enquire on something, I was referred to another staff. Waiting time for food was acceptable.Food & Beverage: Basic drink like teh 'o' was not available cause as per the staff all hot drinks are dispensed through a machine. Thus, they are not able to serve teh 'o' when I requested for it. Food was tasty, I've no complaint about it
4
Nice Char Kway Teow, with "wok hey", the curry is especially tasty and the Sambal sting ray has a layer of nice chilli (but the size is a bit small). The fiery wings is not spicy at all thou. Good to know that they have a central station where all the spices are readily accessible
5
No words to describe the taste of the prawn noodles. At the first sip of the soup, it lifts your mood and wakes your tastebud. The sweet, rich yet light soup is so perfect. The prawns are fresh and succulent served in a mix of bee hoon and yellow noodles with generous slices of chicken meat. This is definitely a place to have my fix of prawn noodles. Penang Culture serves a wide variety of menu and my bet is also on chendol, which is popular among the diners. 5/5☆ rating
3
My wife wanted to try the Penang char kway teow after I told her about my previous meal here, so we had dinner here. She was quite impressed with the dish, which was flavoursome and not too oily.I had grilled squid in chilli with rice. The squid was grilled nicely and was not chewy, though the chilli was not too spicy and a few drops of lemon would have enhanced the taste. We also ordered soursup juice, which was rather bland and did not even have any fruit pieces. My Penang ice kacang was better, though I wished that there was more nutmeg in it
2
We had dinner years ago and had returned to find the standard dropped quite badly. The penang char quay teow is rather flat and tasteless, with shriveled clams that is not fresh. Most unfortunate that proces costs three times as hawker stalls with even better quality. We won't be back
4
Visited the restaurant when we fly back to Singapore , it was a discovery that we didn't expect. The food was fantastic and had all the Penang taste and aroma. The laksa was brilliant and the fried Kwee tweo was excellent , will definitely make this a Favourite eating place . The price is a bit high though but better than taking a flight to Penang for its authentic foo
5
Ambiance is cozy. Staff is smiling & welcoming to customers. Food is halal, tasty and affordable. Will definitely come back.
3
Food is just so so. Quite surprised to see quite a few people ordered "buah long long"... Eekkk.. Lol. Premium Nasi Lemak tastes normal... Just a one visit thing...
3
While nothing beats Penang cuisine in Penang, this airport eatery does have tasty meals. The portions are good and the seasonings appear authentic. We enjoyed the laska and the nutmeg drink.
4
Should you have the yearn to have some Penang food, this is the place to go, especially if you have some Muslim friends with you as this place is halal certified.As always I would have my CKT and ampra juice. However, the do have a whole spread to offer. Do go through the menu to see for yourself what best suit you for the day.Also a great opportunity for our Muslim friends to try out the best Penang Hawkers and Chinese food
3
We popped in here as the tables could accommodate my mom's wheelchair. Service was quite prompt, though food portions could have been larger.We started with Belachan fried rice, my sister's favourite, and it was quite nice, especially with the fried small prawns. The fried kway teow had a lot of 'wok hei', and was the best dish. The Malay mee goreng was too wet and was rather bland, though and the lor bak was also quite disappointing and its only redeeming quality was that it was crispy. The stuffed beancurd was okay while the hot tea latte was nice and not too sweet. As our spending was over S$50, they offered us a very small cold dish plate, of pickled cucumber

Late dinner at Penang Culture, Changi Airport.Curry chicken is the best. Receiving wrong food when ordering "Rojàk" not professional serving.The rest food is ok ok. Staff not so attentive when is nearly to close. As we came at about 2130hrs. Price quite expensive. Not to my expectatio
2
My meal at penang culture was a horror..we were served food without utensils..food came so fast but standard was very poor.i had sambal stingray small portion not fresh at all.satay tasteless.the lemon chicken rice was so so as well.only commendable food was the otah which has crunchy taste.then fried oyster omelette was also a letdown.my friend and i agreed that there will not be a second trip again here
3
Hubby and myself wanted to do a light meal since it was too late for lunch and too early for dinner hence decided to enjoy a meal in an air conditioned place. Not expecting much since prices were reasonable. Ordered a fried glass noodle which was good however portion was relatively small. Miserable ingredients..more like garnishing in my opinion. I had the Penang laksa which I thought was average only. Nothing to shout about. Will not go out of the way for this Penang fare but if I happen to be in the vicinity under the scorching hot weather, I might pop back in
3
This restaurant is located in T2 Changi Airport on the 3rd floor. It can seat about 100pax. Very attentive service from the crew. We placed order on a piece of paper 1st, then make payment at the cashier. The service was fast. Food arrive within 10 to 15mins after ordering. The taste for me was just ok. We were celebrating birthday for our family. The supervisor provided disposable plates for us. Very thoughtful of her
3
We went to the branch at Century Square, which is located next to Kenny Rogers' Roast. You select the dishes you want, then head to the cashier to pay for them first. Service was okay, and the dishes all arrived within 15 minutes.We ordered mee goreng and kang kong with squid in chilli (just okay), Penang kway teow, spicy tofu and Belachan fried rice (quite tasty), as well as oyster egg omelette, which was lacking in taste and a few of the oysters were just north of fresh. They will set a small basket of keropok which will be billed as a snack for S$2, and it is good with belachan. For more chili options, you can choose from a side table.If you spend over S$50 in one receipt using a particular bank's card, they will offer you a free signature drink - you cannot choose and it depends on the day. Prices were okay. The meal, including drinks, cost S$70
4
I had the fried glass noodles. Surprisingly good. There was enough "wok hei" to bring out the flavor of the noodles. Two pieces of shrimp, lots of fish cake and squid and a hint of spiciness. Not bad for less than $10.
5
takeaway the Penang Assam Laksa from the branch in AMK - food nice - worth the value. Will surely go back again to try other food
4
My family had lunch at this outlet. We like the food, tasty Penang food priced slightly higher than hawker centre served in air-conditioned restaurant.
2
Came here with the family after a flight and tried a few different dishes. Food was not impressive: mediocre at best. Also a fairly long wait. Won't bother coming back.
2
Waited 20mins plus for my food to come, and I only ordered a Nasi Lemak which taste quite average. Won't recommend for those who are in rush to eat here.
3
Dined here for a late lunch on a weekday. The restaurant few patrons only and noticed most of them were waiting for food. We ordered nasi lemak and vegetarian fired rice along with fried tofu for sides. My wife's nasi lemak arrived so late that I was almost done with my food and this was after reminding them few times about it. There was nothing exceptional about the food as you can't go wrong with both the items we ordered. price was on the steep side given that the restaurant is located at the airport. Definitely a tourist trap. Trust me there are plenty of restaurants in the city that serves better food than this place
2
We touched down in the evening and wanted some local food. It appears every restaurant has a long line at the airport and we decided to go to this one with Trip Advisor logo displayed.You are required to place your order using the paper slip and make payment at the counter to get your order processed. We ordered some dishes (assam fish head, oyster omelette, blachan fried chicken, lala and sambal kangong) but won't give a thumb up. We have some dishes served without rice despite several reminders. We witnessed customers across the table left in anger after waiting in vain for food that didn't arrive despite payment has been made. The operation is not in sync apparently and this has made the dinning experience unsatisfactory

Penang Culture Restaurant at Jem, Jurong East is a Halal restaurant selling Penang street foods. The three most popular Penang street hawker dishes are the Fried Koay Teow, Prawn Noodle Soup, and the Fried Noodle Indian Style. They are fairly good and worthwhile trying.You have to place orders and pay the bill first at the front counter, then sit back to wait for your foods to be served later. This procedure makes the restaurant operation more efficient with minimum service staffs. Foods are served rather fast after placing orders
2
went to have lunch with my wife to this restaurant called penang culture @ Jem shopping jurong east, I should say the restaurant owner is killing the heritage of penang food. I have been to penang various times, food super good.Unfortunately at this restaurant, the food poor quality. i ordered the followingPENANG HOKKIEN MEE: the soup was very watery, the prawns smelled bad, the garnishes very messy. overall its not a true penang hokkien mee, normal food center hokkien mee tastes first class as compared to this place.Penang assam laksa : did not have the first huuummppp the moment the gravy entered my wife's mouth. very mild, did not taste like laksa, the noodle was too soggy. Penang rojak : too much of cucumber, the char kuey tasted like crackers , did not have the crisp soggy taste, 99.5% cucumber,u can really count the charkuay..... The one at Rojak Power @ ayer rajah food center is 200time better then this place.Ice Kachang : First i ordered chendol, i was annoyed after 30 mins the staff came to tell me that chendol was sold out, I was wandering,,,,chendol sold out Hmmmmmm. so i changed to ice kachang. I was sooo surprise to taste this ice kachang to have a sarsaparilla ( Sarsi ) taste.The beans were those big type ones,the jellies cut into big pieces, lousy quality.This is not a ice kachang at all.Overall i would never recommend this place to my family and friends. I would personally say this is not the real penang food. They are just using the name only, after all who cares, its just a one way ticket for me, i will step into this restaurant again
4
Visited 3x at the branch at Ang Mo Kio Jubilee Square. Personally find the following tasty: char way teow, prawn noodle, Assam laksa, ice kachang. The fried tang hoon is ok, the nasi lemak too. But sambal belacan is good! Char way teow is kinda little in portion, but the price ain't that cheap. The ice kachang has dried nutmeg strips n crushed peanut which goes very well. Yum! Overall, I am quite satisfy with the food, though I have not tried ALL the food. Will. Go back again? Answer is yes, I will, especially my fav Assam laksa! Jus a note, restaurant should look into the flies issue, though not many, but one or two can spoil the image of the restaurant's cleanlines
