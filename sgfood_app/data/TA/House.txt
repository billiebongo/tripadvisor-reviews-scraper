Went again for their pork belly bun, excellent as always. Berries cocktail a must try. Was recommended to try the Beef and it was nicely done. Excellent service by everyone and a pity that they have to close end of the month.

This is a great place to go with friends where the ambience is nice and the food is delicious. My British friend really enjoyed the environment and the yummy food.

Kudos to Pat the waiter for excellent service and willingness to recommend. Had the rib eye steak and snapper with pumpkin soup which were all good. Restaurant overlooks a balcony and plush greenery. Recommended for lunch. Toilet is really cool with unique decor and plumbing too.Shame that the restaurant is closing end Jan 2018. Hope the management finds a new cool location

I read about the owner Cynthia Chua, a lifestyle legend who also own Tiong Bahru Bakery, Skinny Pizza and Tippling Club, which I like very much. So I must give 'House' a try. It is a huge resturant, unusual location with quirky and interesting interior decoration. That show the owner must have lots of fun putting it together, who could only achieve this type ambience when you are passionate about the theme. The name of the food and menu are creative and fun. We had Risotto and Linguini for our dinner with Asahi beer, and shared a Tau Har Pau as dessert. The food taste great for casual bistro. Music is soft and weeknight is calm and comfortable. The bill came out to about S$50 per head, for a fun and enjoyable evening. Great place for casual group visit
5
Had found the ambience to be refreshing and hip. The entrance to the restaurant is a bit obscure from where the taxi driver dropped me. Had ordered the baked pumpkin, pumpkin fries, snapper, pizza, mussels and risotto. Had enjoyed all the dishes. Very well cooked and tasty.Waiting time for food is an issue though. We waited quite a while for the food to be served to us.Had enjoyed my meal there nevertheless

We had lunch here on a Sunday. The restaurant was very busy and VERY noisey. I did not find it to be a relaxing place. Perhaps it is the lack of soft furnishings that allows the noise level to be so high. The food was good.. the staff was pleasant but seemed to be very rushed! Apart from the noisey ambience, my other complaint was when we asked the waiter if we could substitute mushrooms for tomatoes on the pizza. His answer was an immediate and abrupt NO! He did not go to consult with the chef, he did not offer other options or tell us that we could have the mushrooms but we would have to pay more... nothing! Just NO. I felt this could have been handled better

Was lunching here with my colleagues, the decor is rather hipster with deliberate mismatched furnitures, but the vibes is good. We were sitting by the windows and it is really nice to look out to the greenery outside.Was told the fries here are really good but I'm not a big fan of fries. I love my salad and main chicken dish, but my colleagues pasta is average only.The dessert Gula Melaka cupcake is fantastic 
5
This is a lovely place for high tea in the Dempsey area ..not in a hotel. Plenty of parking and you don't feel rushed .Small quality portions with good high tea selections. Don't come here if you are looking for the full Singapore buffet spread with local food , seafood etc . High tea is not available on weekends . We are usually there on Fridays .tea starts at 3 pm till530 pm .do book in advance . You won't be disappointed . Great place for girl friends or family to meet and chill . Service is prompt and the buffet spread is replenished till it ends at 530pm

We had a get together with some friends to celebrate a few birthdays. House is a Greta place to do so, they also have rooms for group gathering and was perfect for us. Like we had our own dining room The menu selection is wide so you can always find something to try even if you are a big group with diverse food preferences. The hanger steak was done just right. The mushroom risotto was ok but not fantastic. The pastas are pretty good. The serving sizes are decent for food sharing, sonorder a few dishes and can share for 3-5 people
3
Looking for a quick brunch being around the area, so decided to pop by. Had their "Luxe Eggs Ben" which sounded nice with duck confit. But there was nothing luxurious about it. Eggs & shredded duck came on a slice of toast & a sprinkling of oats on a large plate that looked empty. No side salad or anything else. Usually a nice place, but unfortunately didn't quite deliver on the food this time..
5
came here for dinner with a large group of friends, ordered lots of items to share. loved the food, and nice relaxing space. friendly service as well
4
Very interesting place for lunch - part of a complex of old military buildings that are almost all now eating places. Some interesting choices for both food and drink. Slightly pricey we felt compared to other locations but quality was good and service efficient.
4
Took my friends from US there for high tea. Very good value for money. Wide selection of good quality savories and sweets buffet style. Interesting tea selection.
3
5 of us went on a Thursday afternoon for late lunch early tea. Usual afternoon set lunch menu. Set menu had soup, main course, and dessert or coffee/tea. How could a dessert be a coffee/tea, or coffee/tea be dessert? So my friend decided to order the fish set with dessert, and ordered her pot of tea. The rest of us shared 2 thin pizza and ordered our own coffee or tea. The fish was just right, fortunately not too dry. Dessert cheesecake was a saving grace. The THIN pizza was A DISAPPOINTMENT. it was not even thin pizza. It was crusty pizza. It cracks and breaks when we cut it. It was just brown crust from overbaking in the centre. The sides around the pizza was unevenly kneaded and thus uneven thinness. You basically scoop and eat the topping with bits of brown crust, if you get it under the topping. The truffle mushroom pizza would not have been so bad or heavy going if it had a thin, and I mean a thin pizza crust under it. Not over baked crumbly pieces of broken crust beneath it. Really thin crumbly brown crust. I'm just very disappointed by it that's why I'm emphasizing on the extremely thin crumbled brown bits of crust. Similarly, the ginger chicken pizza was not a great pizza. Similarly thin brown overbaked crumbled/broken-when-cut-crust in centre (in that state because by time the uneven sides around the pizza cooks, the centre of it is overbaked) just crumbled upon cutting. So you scoop the fillings of the pizza onto your plate. The chicken was heavy going, too strong 'curried' flavoured '. Not a good choice. How can that be a choice made by many customers?? Fortunately we ordered only two thin pizzas. It was a real disappointment. We ate the thin pizza a couple of years back. It did not taste like that. It was really thin pizza. Not crumbly crusted pizza. I would not recommended anyone eating their thin pizzas after these two that we had. Well, the ambience was not too bad...go for coffee or tea. Food...so-so...a bit pricey and not so fantastic. Service was alright. It was not crowded when we went around 2.45pm. Needs improvement in your recipe or use a little more dough for the pizza base

The restaurant is out of the way and you could easily miss it. The staff were very friendly and helpful. My wife, son and I ordered a vanilla coffee slush, pineapple fling and berry good. The drinks were really good. We then ordered a side dish of truffle fries which were nice but left some because of the amount of oil left in the scoop. I had the truffled mushroom soup with bits of mushroom which was really good and tasty. For main my wife had the bone marrow burger which she found delicious; my son had the fish and chips which he enjoyed; and I had the roast chicken with mashed potatoes and carrots which was average. The chicken was on the bone and there was not enough mash. The cost was just over $162. Not cheap for anyone on a budget. Overall not a bad wee place to visit on a Saturday afternoon
1
Had to wait 15mins for a table despite reservation. The waitress who took our orders was nice enough but her ability leaves much to be desired when our food did not arrive after 30mins and all she could do was "send her colleague to the kitchen to check". When no one came back to us after 45mins, we spoke to the manager and all he could say was "the average waiting time for food here is ONE hour!" Asked if we have to wait for other tables to finish their dessert before we got our starters (how hard is it to heat up mushroom soup????), he actually said yes, as the kitchen cooked according to the orders by the WHOLE table. He finally agreed to walk to the kitchen to check our orders and what did he come by with - you are unlikely to get your food in the next 30mins!!! I am surprised this restaurant has even stayed open this long. Same bad experience 2 year ago and I must have had amnesia to even visit again
3
So we have arrived a bit early and the staff was very flexible about it and got us a table right away. The place is great for brunch and all of the dishes were nice and very decent for the price. I would come again during my next visit.
1
Visited on a Sunday. Arrived at 215pm for a late lunch. Took 10 minutes to get a table, another hour for the food to arrive - despite repeated reminders. The fried eggs were overcooked. The snapper hadn't been spiced and arrived cold. The burgers were good. This is the second bad experience here. Never Again.
3
Went there for brunch, with a friend I have not seen in years, and was expecting some exceptional service and food based on the research done. The service, decor, overall setup were amazing. The food average at best. We both had eggs Benedict and we were disappointed in the presentation and taste. This is not a cheap restaurant, just like most/all of the restaurants on Dempsey Hill. Access is a bit tricky, as you have to get behind the buildings , go down the stairs before you find any evidence of the restaurant. This is not uncommon for Dempsey Hill, but it did take me longer to find this restaurant , compared to others in the area. Better signage and maybe some tips and pictures on their website would help
4
After struggling to find a place for a very late lunch/early dinner, we ended at HOUSE by accident - but it was a very pleasant surprise. The balcony is embedded in lush greenery and it has a very pleasant atmosphere.We had a paella, which was really good and a salad with avocado and an amazing dressing. We also had the non-alcoholic cocktails which were really, really good.Great place which is off the beaten track in Dempsey Hill
4
Great ambience - the restaurant is a converted army barracks! The food is great - lots of meat and some solid vegetarian options. Sunday brunch menu is a must try - big portions and tasty! Service is generally friendly, but lacks finesse.
5
Lovely place good food for brunch and service is fast
We came with little baby and she is fine with the atmosphere. Advanced booking is recommended.
Enjoy!
4
Lunch with a few colleagues and we ordered skinny pizzas and their mandatory taro fries and curry fries. Always a favorite haunt especially with my family. Prices are reasonable and service is prompt.
4
We were really impressed with the food at House. The snapper and Pom Pom salad were fantastic. The wine was disappointing and an overhaul of the wine list should be done urgently as many weren't available and our selected wine wasn't good. Some of the others on the wine list had a feel of 'bin end' selection. The service from start to end was helpful and friendly. We will return although probably on a night when we don't fancy wine with dinner.

House at Dempsey is located in a lovely setting - surrounded by lush greenery in Dempsey Hill. It's a little off the main strip of Dempsey and is 'housed' in a pavillion-like structure. Lovely environment to dine in. I was there twice this week. Once for High Tea - which is only available on Saturday and Sunday. Very reasonably priced for a great selection of food. A small complaint: the fruit salad tasted off! The watermelon tasted especially bad, like it was soaked in ammonia. I went there again at night for dinner due to friends' requests. The selection was again very good, and most of the food did taste very good. However, I ordered a medium-well, a little pink inside, steak. The maitre'd said that he couldn't promise that I would get what I want. And I didn't. I had a steak that was medium rare because, as the waiter said, this was how it should be cooked. I was not sure that I appreciated being taught the manner of steak eating but didn't want to kick up a fuss. All in all, it was a good dining experience and I would go back. I would probably be more firm with what I want
5
The restaurant is not easy to get to without a car. But if you drive, it is convenient because parking is quite easy in the afternoon. I love the rustic and 'jungle-like' atmosphere of the restaurant exterior. We need to go down a flight of steps to get to it and it worked up our appetite.The interior is cool and is a wonderful escape from the heat. Besides the cool air, we were also greeted with a faint 'woody' smell. It took us a while to recognise that it was the smell of truffle in their famous truffle fries. The staff are very attentive and a tad too eager to clear our dishes. On one or two occasions, we had to stop them from taking aware plates that we weren't completely done with. We had the Bolognese with Mozzarella skinny pizza, Bone Marrow and Steak Burger with Bacon Jam, and Truffle Fries. Everything tasted wonderful and the portions are pretty decent too.For beverage, I tried the Great Detox juice and the Berry Good Smoothie. Can't complain even if I tried. We loved them!This is my 3rd visit to the place and I intend to come again. Good job guys

This is one of our Favourite restaurants. Food is consistently good and we have tried many items in the menu and so far our visits have been pleasant. This time, we ordered Asian Slider and Chicken Tonkatsu (new on menu). I was surprised by the chicken as I thought Katsu would just be a plain bread crumbed chicken with sauce. It has aragula, thinly sliced cheese, cherry tomato and most importantly, a little mixture of Italian pesto and Japanese sauce in TOP of the Katsu. Highly recommended. Also had a bottle of Mitolo Jester for $68, very good value and satisfied evenin
5
Cannot recommend this place enough. The food is delicious without being complicated. Shared an incredible goat cheese and pumpkin pasta along with the shnitzel mushroom burger and could not figure out what made the flavour so unique. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other goodies on the menu
4
Novin & Chloe invited us so off we went excited to try a new place!This place is rather a cross between a restaurant, canteen and cafeteria.... oh yeah and juice bar all rolled into one!Food was nice, what I would call solid cafeteria cooking, not trying to be anything it is not.The cake display was a nice touch and the service was efficient throughout. Dishes below:Chicken and waffles, tasty combination but we felt like the chicken could've been a bit fleshier!Asian sliders were probably that dish of the day, slow cooked pork belly in steamed buns.Blackened fish is the house favorite and I saw an empty plate going back so it must've been great.Chicken Sandwich was served in a baguette with the usual trimmings, fail safe option as ever.For cakes we got the red velvet and asian taro cake with coconut, both were very good and washed down with fresh juices from the in house juice bar.Worth a try if you fancy something a bit familiar.... but with a twist
3
I was rather disappointed with House. We met some friends for lunch here (both of us bringing our 3yo's) and found it to be incredibly loud with rather average service. We asked for the music to be turned down (so we could hear each other talk) only to be met with confusion at first, followed by a polite rejection. We ended up taking the little ones outside to run around so they weren't overwhelmed by the noise.On the plus side, the food was amazing. My recommendation is to go at a less busy time. Definitely try their eggs benedict. Great stuff
5
Excellent and friendly service. Great choice of food and drinks. Very nice food. (Old fashioned American sliders - cheddar and bacon) One of the best sliders I've ever had. Very nice coffee as well and great atmosphere. 10/10 would come again.
5
Meal was very pleasant. I like the assortment of desserts and they have interesting names and flavors. Service was very prompt. Great place for all sorts of occasion. They also provide rooms for meetings and so on at good prices per pax.

Tucked in Dempsey hill is this cafe/restaurant which used to be a military barrack. Now they serve up cakes, finger food, coffee & cocktails plus full meals. The area is lush green amongst the forest. We were even lucky enough to spot a hornbill flying from tree to tree just nearby our seat. Gorgeous greenery. Interior design deco is eclectic. Quite nice & contemporary. The service, alright but not beyond requirement. I found the items on the menu pricey. Pasta above $25, pizzas as well above $25, fries from $8 depending on the flavors, sweet potato nibbles $8, truffle fries $12, curry fries $9 (if I didn't remember wrongly), hazelnut pumpkin fries $12. Other food items on the menu all above $25. Cocktail Drinks are also above $15. Not cheap. I would say expensive for the quality. I'm not saying the taste is poor. It's not beyond requirement. It's good but not outstanding. Portion size is good. The ondeh ondeh cake was a disappointment though. I found it too dry. Felt like the cake had been sitting in the fridge for too long. On the whole I enjoy the ambience and chill environment but I feel it's too pricey. Location of Dempsey is also inaccessible. You need a car or taxi. I've been to house only less than 5 times before. I'm a foodie, it didn't make a stamp on me... Would I be back? Maybe. Not on the immediate top of the mind recall though.
4
Good spot for a light lunch. Nice - if a bit pricey - smoothies and juices, tasty salads and splendid sliders. Service was fine, despite it being very busy. Certainly not cheap, but then nothing in the Dempsey area is. Clean toilets, plenty of room and a nice view across to the forest
2
We had a business dinner for about 12 and ordered set menus for convenience. It's been about 8 years since i was last here and this time, far from impressedMy soup starter had the cheap soup bowl/cup one sees in a cheap cafe. Others who ordered the pumpkin salad had a better presentationMy main of pork was awful and i only had 3 bites. It was overcooked and hard as rock. Yuck. The other mains of chicken , capellini looked slightly betterMy dessert of chocolate cake was ok but again with lousy presentation. Others had a fruit platter and it looked like it was made by a 5 year old working in a hawker stall. My guests outright rejected it and ordered the chocolate cake instead. Awfu
4
I had lunch at Dempsey recently and needed a coffee.I walked around and found myself at House.Went in and ordered an espresso. I opted to sit outside, where there's a veranda and this afforded me a great view of the trees outside. It was lovely to sit alfresco and enjoy nature in the heart of the city while having a coffee.Coffee was good
3
I have eaten here three times. Twice for brunch and once in the evening. This was over a period of about 6 months. The food was reasonable and the menu interesting. However, this place is really let down by terrible service. On all three occasions drinks orders were a problem for them, whether the drink was simple or not. Some drinks would take 10 minutes to come and others 30 minutes. Even when you asked if they had forgotten they said "no, the bar is just busy". The food also comes out at completely different times. Some of parties received their food after 20 mins some after 40 mins. This place just does not seem well run.
4
An eclectic and inviting interior. Well laid out, warm and inviting in colour and decor. Has a 'friends eating a family food at home' atmosphere.Menu is good for brunch and dinner. Strange that they didn't seem to have a dedicated kids menu and that all the dishes seem very adult in nature.We ate here for dinner with 4 adults and 3 young children on a Friday night. The restaurant was crowded but not unpleasantly noisy. We ordered the kids food (pizza) as soon as we arrived and specifically asked for only tomato sauce and cheese. It took a while to arrive and when it did come was effectively a pizza with bolognaise meat sauce topping and slices of mozzarella sprinkled with herbs. Ok, but I did wonder if it was a pasta sauce on a pizza base. The kids were not overwhelmed.This was a special request as all the menu was quite funky and nice, but not ideal for 4 year olds. It seems that they are not completely set up for kids as plates and cups were completely cheap disposable plastic for them, very flimsy, and the kids were given a placemat and a single pencil to draw a picture. Nice that they had something but seems like it was not really geared towards children.We ordered cocktails (good if a little pricey) and the charcuterie as a starter together with truffle fries. Charcuterie was good, fries were delicious. We also tried the sweet potato fries which were a bit too deep fried for our taste.For mains we had the green pasta (good, if a little strange with a pesto made of Asian herbs), the spare ribs (superb, not really enough if you did not have a starter) and the pork tenderloin (also nice). We skipped desserts.All in all a pleasant experience, could be improved by getting a good kids pizza choices set up and more family friendly experience

I think Dempsey Hill is a cool place to be, and House also appears to have the atmosphere you are looking for in the area. The menu is a mix of dishes from Spain, Italy, US and a bit of Thai. But is is never the real stuff. I guess it is supposed to be a fusion, but it looks more like a confusion kitchen to me. The starter was a German Beef Borscht (never heard about that, and it did not look like Borscht at all), One of my colleagues had a pizza with a paperthin crust - "like tomato on a biscuit" My hanger steak was OK, but not more.The staff seems to be quite unexperienced - fx they insisted on us keeping our cutlery for the main dish, though we already put it plates, Napkins, that went out platres, were not replaced and when we asked for salt and pepper, we got a peppermill with no pepper in. I have to stress that the staff is very friendly and service minded, but very unexperienced.The Singaporean kitchen is a wonderfull blend of Malay, Indian, Thai and Chinese. We will try that tomorrow instead and so should House
4
The ambiance is beautiful - dewy, modern, and very attractive. They have an interesting menu with tonnes of variety, right from soups and salads to Risottos and Pasta. The highlight of the menu is the multiple different kind of fries! We got the Truffle Fries, Sweet Potato Niblets, & The Pumpkin Hazelnut Fries. The Truffle fries were delicious. The Sweet Potato ones were not very well done so we sent them back and got the Pumpkin fries instead. These were good with a nice curry flavour and crumbly texture.For mains, we ordered various things - The Turkish Salad (delicious with really well made Falafel), Macadamia Crusted Pumpkin Salad (well made with a lovely sauce and well dressed Arugula), Agli Olio Pasta, & Ahi Tuna Salad. We also tried some of their interestingly named Cold pressed fresh juices - Minty Melon, Pick me up (beetroot, carrot, and mint), Pearfect (Apple, Pear, Celery) - they were all refreshing!For dessert, we shared a brownie style chocolate cake drizzled with a salted caramel sauce and vanilla bean ice cream. It rounded off a well made meal.The service definitely gets brownie points - prompt and friendly

We ordered a vast selection from the menu from pizza to pasta, risotto to salad, sticky date pud to cake. And it was all great. The black pepper prawn linguine was creative and very tasty. Service was attentive. They were nice enough not to kick us out the moment the closing hour arrived

House is a cool restaurant on Dempsey Road near the Botanical Gardens in Singapore. It is a trendy place with an excellent outdoor area. It was quiet at lunchtime on the weekend. The look of House is cool, especially outside. The backdrop of greenery and trees means this feels like the tropics. The seating is both comfortable and an enjoyable space. A relaxing and pleasant place to be.The food range is really good. There are quite a few different options including multiple vegetarian choices. The cuisine spans a few different cultures but seems to be well-received regardless. The flavouring of a levantine dish was really close to authentic, impressive.Dessert was of course divine. The deliberately provocative names given to some of the dessert options is matched by the flavour. NIce to eat quality chocolate with a touch of fruit in this part of the world.House isn't the cheapest but the price is fine given the quality. Value because of the excellent environment and eating. Service was friendly and helpful, efficient enough for a laid-back place. Worth dropping into House for a bite to eat in a pleasant part of Singapore

first visit to this place for lunch with some girls friends last week. the location itself is great - gives you the vibes of being out of the city and into the country feel. no problem if you drive - lots of parking. interesting menu - too many choices so we decided to share. the waiter gave some good recommendations which we took. lovely fresh juices to quench your thirst. love the greenery, the loo is quite cute too. it can get noisy if there is a big group though. great place to just do a brunch, lunch, chill - just get away from the city and spend an hour or 2 there. love the desserts too.. save room for that
1
Went for an early brunch together with the family. When arriving the restaurant was relatively empty. Yet, we had to wait for more than 30 min before the drinks was served. The food was only served 1 hour after we put the order in. When the food arrived only 50% of the table was served the the other guests had to wait a further 10~15 min rueing the family brunch. Further the staff started circling the table and removing plates and dishes that was "done" when other guests where just starting. It had to be said that in the end the restaurant give a 20% discount on the bill, however a much better solution would be offer a refreshment of our drinks that was long gone when the food arrived. Luckily Singapore is full of places that can get this right and I dont have to go back here
5
The whole place is pretty big and there's outdoors sitting as well. The scenery outdoors is just amazing and peaceful. I recommend going in the morning as it will be quiet and serene. The service is good. The menu is a bit hard to decipher at first but who cares when the food you ordered turns out delicious? Will definitely come back again

Designed with the solace of a home away from home in mind, existing for the purpose of enabling its patrons to unwind, chill out and just enjoy meals or drinks in utmost comfort. It is a spacious gallery-residence with a rather rustic charm to it, and one of the prettiest (unexpected!) washrooms I have visited, especially amongst restaurantsService was good throughout; the only drawback was that food took a long while to be served.For starters, we had the Pumpkin Hazelnut Fries (SGD$12.00); both our eyes fell on that on the menu unanimously, and hence ordered one of it to share. The straw-cut fries were crumbly on the outside, with a lovely crispy batter of flour and hazelnut; the inside was a little mushy but endearingly sweet with pumpkin's flavour. Paprika and chilli joined the union of salty and sweet combination - the contrast was awesome; we were both glad we'd chosen this.Then my Lemongrass Chicken Salad (SGD$16.00) was brought over. This is officially one of the most interesting salads I ate as well - grilled chicken salad tossed with long ribbons (note, not shredded or cut!) pickled carrots, carrots and cucumber, tossed with zesty lime, chilli and coconut dressing (where is the lemongrass?). The result was a flavourful dish with tender chicken meat, crunchy strips of vegetables that the palate loves and we could not get enough of it.Finally, the Jamaican Jerk Pork Tenderloin (SGD$27.00) prepared with exotic Jamaican spices, and served with roasted garlic potatoes, roasted asparagus and peach-cranberry chutney. The pork was thoughtfully sectioned into smaller pieces, so that the diners need not do the hard work - but anyway the pork was so tender, cutting it would have been a breeze. Yes, so lovely it disintegrates in the mouth upon contact with the teeth, and the smokey hints merged beautifully with the herbs infusion, making this dish another palate pleaser.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to refer here:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/05/dinner-at-house-dempsey.htm

I went there around 8ish for dinner (one of the places you don't have to reserve). We ordered blackened snapper and pork tenderloin. The latter was sooooo small (4 small cubes of potato). Tasted fine but obviously we won't pay 27bucks plus 17% of tax for like 3 small cuts of meat (weighed at most 100g in total).The snapper was fine. All in all, overpriced and small portions. Unless you order steak frites. Atmosphere was good, very busy
5
I was exhausted when I stumbled across this place ... i had walked all around the botanical gardens and orchid gardens, then up to Dempsey Hill for a wonder.... WELL ... this little gem just made my day! Gorgeous watermelon and mint cooler, the BEST pumpkin hazelnut fries i've EVER eaten!!!! The menu is to die for! I just wanted to eat it all! I think I will have to go back before I leave

Last weekend while wandering around Dempsey, we felt like comfort food in a chic atmosphere, so we headed for HOUSE. It’s the perfect place for a relaxed meal and quality time with friends or family especially during weekends. We had a scrumptious brunch on Saturday (11am - 430pm, but no worries, you can step in also on Sundays from 9am to 430pm) and we loved everything in the menu, from Southern Eggs Benedict, to Flaky Fish Croquettes; from Baked Brie to Charcuterie Platters; from Pepper Prawns to Asparagus, Serrano Ham, and Crumbled Egg… not to mention the famous Metre-long Sausage!The decor was really charming and all the artwork really reminded us that it’s time to up the ante on the decor in our house..
5
Went here for lunch with friends and the service and food was immaculate! Would recommend this for breakfast/lunch or dinner!! :)

We went with family and friends for brunch on Christmas day. We were a group of 6 persons, some vegetarian & others non-vegetarians. All of us ordered different items from the menus. However none of the items came up to our expectations. In fact some of the items like salads were downright disappointing
3
After an exhausting workshop with our business partner, we came here for lunch. I ordered the following :Starter - Pearl Barley Salad (it is tasteless and most of us on the table regretted ordering this dish. I should have ordered the Lemongrass grilled chicken salad!) Main - Sliders (bacon & cheddar) with french fries + sweet potato fries (the cheese tasted funky and I had a feeling I had bluecheese rather than cheddar. I didn't finish the burger)Dessert - Warm chocolate toffee cake (this is my fav!! It tasted as good as it looks. I am very happy I ordered this) Overall, the food is not that great and don't think I will retur
1
No one came to take our order for 20 minutes. Had to go to counter had ask them to come over. 30 minutes later half of the order arrived. 20 minutes later my dish arrived. No explanation, no apology, no offer of discount. Had to ask for water 4 times before they brought it. Fries had so much coating on them it was like eating saw dust. Hollandaise looked and tasted like runny cinema cheese. Will not be back here
3
Had dinner there with family and it was a great, fun and informal venue. Service was good, and all the waitstaff were friendly and efficient.The food was the main reason we visited, and most of the dishes lived up to expectations. We started with the tau sah pau (bean filled bun) which was soft and tasty. Other favourites included squid ink paella and pizza, capellini with seared prawns and squid, and the appetiser board with pate, Iberico ham, capers and bread. We also ordered the fish platter - the grilled squid was good, while the deep fried fish was not as tasty. It also came with truffle fries, which were so delicious we ordered another plate. The pumpkin roasted fries were more miss than hit, though.For desserts, the salted caramel ice cream with toasted brioche was a firm favourite, with the keylime pie a close second. While the orange blossom carrot cake and the cheese cake were not as good. For drinks, we had various cocktails and mocktails, including mojitos. Most were refreshing - do check out their promotion of S$35 for three cocktails/mocktails.Would recommend making a reservation if you are going on weekends. They also have a S$30 high tea every Thursday and Friday between 330 and 5 pm
5
it is located in a mild green nature. that s why i always feel relaxed whenever I come here. The staffs are very friendly and nice when recommend me awesome dishes. Barley salad is so fresh and aromatic with lemon zest. Hanger steak is really impressive to me. That's the great moment I used to have to enjoy my life after working

Recently one of my girlfriend organized an afternoon to celebrate a birthday and we were not disappointed! The array of food was sufficient for high tea without going over the top. Here some of my fave, mini burger, potato gratin, simple pizza bite, chocolate truffle cake, cheese cake. Theres also bread basket with choice of topping like tuna & pineapple, truffle mushroom, olive & cheese and Camembert or Brie cheese. Theres more but I didn't have some of them. There's also a cold drink stand which I think it's lemon with soda & basil. So refreshing! All this for $30++ with refillable 4 pots of flavored teas such as white rose, ginger, muah muah & grape. No coffee.Oh the deco of the place is also very nice. The staff were nice to give us candle to put on one of the mini chocolate mousse for our birthday girl

This restaurant is meant to be fun. Located in a greener corner of Dempsey Hill - lush surroundings, eclectic dÃ©cor, although all these steps are not too friendly for handicapped customers! The food is well-executed familiar dishes with a twist (skinny pizzas, unusual salads, wagyu spring rolls, all kinds of fries, etc). Wait staff used to be snobs, but service has improved when we last went there. Overall, a comfortable place I would happily return to occasionally, but nothing out of the ordinary

Went for dinner after spotting an article that this place server gourmet fries.1. Location - At the near end of dempsey hill, not too brightly lighted and went it through the back door (which shares with the SPA)2. Service - since it was still slightly early for dinner, they were plenty of space and the staff was fast to spot us and ushered us to our seat (made a reservation prior). The waitress was clear to explain some of the items in the menu. 3. Food - tried the Seafood Bisque, probably too heavy on the pernod to my liking, but pretty much the same as what other fine dinning would serve. For mains, the missus took the Roasted Barramudi and i took the Hanger Steak, very well served and pleasant to the eye. Taste wise, it was nice and well seasoned. Definitely recommend this.4. Fries - tried the Truffle Fries, aromatic fragrance of the Truffle oil was well balanced and was nicely placed in a serving tray.overall a nice place for a special occasion

A nice restaurant in Dempsey Hill. Great location and nice views. Busy when we were there. Menu mediocre, nothing spectacular. Food not bad...the service AWFUL. The management haven't got a grip of the service at all. There is chaos and the poor staff have absolutely no direction. There were 6 of us including two children. The food came in drips and drabs. Both the kids ordered the sliders (burgers). One came with the pizza. After another 15 minutes or so, another couple of dishes arrived, after repeated chasing, the other burger came. Finally, after about half an hour, and when everyone else had finished, the final dish arrived. It actually tasted OK but the whole experience was off putting having to eat on one's own!! The waiter did not once apologise and didn't really care that we all ate at different times!! The management should be ashamed of the service standards and the quality of their staff. This place is obviously a victim of its own success. No one cares that the service is bad and disorganised. The staff carry on as it nothing is wrong and the worse part, I guess is that most of the customers accept this appalling service. If you don't mind eating so so food in a busy chaotic environment with inexperienced waiting staff and management who don't really care!! We did try their churozz. My advice is to give it a miss. Smooth and not ridged (they are ridged so they hold the chocolate). The chocolate sauce was miserly and was diluted milk chocolate with added vanilla. All in all not a great end to the meal!! Would I go back...not even if someone else was paying!!

HOUSE is a huge eatery packed to the gills with "ladies who lunch" and all kinds of wannabes, including the usual motley group of expats, beautiful people, not-so-beautiful ones who think that by being there, they will look beautiful too. The menu consists of mainly Western dishes that are rather pedestrian and over-priced. If you don't know any better, you'd think you've found a mother lode of a restaurant but then many clueless people are quite happy to accept mediocre food, horrific, impersonal service and what not, so who am I to criticize? I had the braised pork shoulder rigatoni. No wow factor but I survived the meal, so there it goes. And I won't go again, for sure. Not my kind of house

We've been to House a few times and while the food ranges from average to excellent the service is always somewhat chaotic. The brunch is nothing special and the menu is eclectic to say the least.I love the tuna salad, skinny pizzas from their sister brand and adore the spanish doughnuts. My friends thought the brunch fare was average at best and my vegetarian partner has highs and lows here.The wine list is pretty good and they do some nice smoothies. The desserts are also pretty good although bizarrely the range of teas is not great and on one day when we cam they had run out of several of them. As they're promoting afternoon tea that's not a great advert for it.It's an interesting concept in an interesting venue but don't expect too much

I wanted to like House. It had lovely decor and there were some dishes like the Asian sliders and pumpkin fries that were delicious but... And this is a BUT the service was pretty bad. Started at the door when a call came as we arrived. We waited 5 min while the staff answered queries and no one came to take us to our table while he was occupied. Granted there was some pleasant service then when the staff helped to move tables when our party shrank from 8 to 6 and changed some chairs as requested. However, after taking our orders, a different wait staff came back to confirm and got everything wrong because she could not read her colleague's handwriting, mistaking warm water for a warm salad!Towards the end of the meal was when the mistakes started piling up. One staff member came up to us and told us that we need to vacate the table by 8pm. We replied that we were not informed when we made a reservation for 6pm or when we were shown to our table. The response was 'really?' So, he goes off to check and then never comes back to us, ignoring us the entire evening after. In the first place, there were quite a few empty tables around us and we actually were already ordering dessert them so we wouldn't have minded leaving after but it was the generally careless attitude that got to me.Then suddenly, this army of waitresses started clearing our tables. One attempted to pull my plate from under me while I was holding a slice of food above it and then asked if she may clear. Another had our charcuterie plate in her hand with 1/3 of the contents. When asked 'shouldn't you ask if we're done?', she gave a dirty look and took it away.By then, I've had enough. Bad service due to begin short handed is understandable. There were plenty of staff but ignorance, rudeness and a lack of training seemed to be their hallmark. This includes the lady in the lovely toilet who made me feel as though I was intruding on her space and getting in her way as she guarded the loo jealously from us invaders. Granted there were those who tried, including a more senior lady who heard my comment and waved her hand apologetically in my direction but I'm not coming back and I am telling everyone I know about this experience. Average food and bad service sums up the dining experience at House

Casual relaxing ambience in an old large house with plenty of greenery. Décor is eclectic with old pieces that evoke memories of a simpler past. The most comprehensive menu for fries - yam, sweet potato, pumpkin and yes, potato too in tempting flavors like truffle, curry. Definitely a must try! The wheat noodles came with giant succulent prawns in a spicy sauce. American sliders were delicious with very juicy flavorsome beef patties, despite the small size of the sliders. Service was excellent. We were fortunate to have this warm and helpful Filipino server who gave wonderful service

There are a lot of good things to say about the place. I think the menu is interesting and has a good mixture of styles which should please most people. And service front of house was very good indeed. Judging by the reviews of Barracks (its previous guise - not sure if it has been with the same management throughout) the service had been lacking.Food was hit and miss. They have an interesting selection of fries (sweet potato, carrot fennel, truffle taro etc), I asked if the chef would let us try one piece of each so we could choose one we really liked. It was a bit of an unusual request but I thought it would have been in keeping with the type of restaurant House is about. Unfortunately Chef said NO. Not a problem but a minor relaxation of rules and a huge amount of goodwill would have been created. Not to mention a better informed choice about an interesting set of menu options for fries. As I said food was hit and miss. I had the celeriac soup & scallops to start. As a previous reviewer has stated this is a little misleading as the scallop content was definitely in the singular and not plural!! Possibly a single scallop sliced in two or perhaps half a scallop sliced in two. Either way the scallop content was negligible and somewhat laughable. I did a spot the difference with the beautiful photograph on the menu which wasn't hard.My wife had the tomato salad with goat's cheese, poached egg and avocado. Missing in action was the goat's cheese - possibly having a soiree with the scallops.Strangely the poached egg was fridge cold. In my opinion a freshly poached egg would have worked better.Mains were OK. Hangar steak was cold, fries were warm. Perhaps the steak needed to rest a little more after cooking. I had the macadamia crusted pumpkin salad which was a little industrial in its presentation (two large segments of a pumpkin roasted) but tasty. Roasted vegetables are usually a hit with me.That was that really. Wine was fine and as I mentioned the service was excellent. You can see the staff are trying really hard. The kitchen might need a little more guidance. I would have expected outstanding from a group that boasts the Tippling Club.Would I go back? Probably. The setting is nice - a bit like the PS Café. Just need to choose carefully from the menu and take the rough with the smooth

This is my third visit to the restaurant and it never disappoints.. It started raining hard and we had brought along our 6 month old baby.. we did not have a reservation so we were a bit worried that we might be turned away. But we were greeted quickly and led to a table promptly. The place was quite packed despite the rain. Food was good as usual (we had pizza and carrot cake).. I love the eclectic furniture, the posters on the walls, the friendly staff.. Even the rain could not dampen our spirits. The waitress smiled and tried to play with our baby a few times, which is reassuring for parents worried that their little one might be ruining it for others.. All in all, I love this place

Always loved House @ Dempsey but I have to be honest - the service blew. Last few months though, they've really gotten their act together and the service has been great. Not sure if they got some new management or what but good job guys. Service is finally matching the good food and fun atmosphere. Now you just need to open up that beautiful back terrace for lunch/brunch and you'll give PS Cafe a run for their money

Style over substance was the order of the day.....four of us ate and we were all incredibly disappointed by what we got, especially for the price. My wife ordered salmon hash and got a tiny bowl of cream sauce with about four small pieces of salmon and four potato cubes swimming around. The pâté on the charcuterie platter smelt awful and actually made one of us wretch and to top it off it took 40 minutes for our drinks to arrive and when they did they were wrong. By this point we just wanted to pay and leave. We rarely complain and are normally pretty easy going but we shan't be returning here and urge you to give it a miss also. There are so many great places to eat in Singapore so don't waste your time here....if they spent as much time getting there food right as they did trying to look cool, then this place'd be great

Went to House after reading a recommendation in an expat magazine. The decor/atmosphere is very nice, eclectic, but cozy. The balcony/outdoor area overlooks a pretty forest. Tried two of their cocktails, the mojito with the vanilla in it was delightful, and the Latin cocktail was good but hard to enjoy with way too much crushed ice. Shared one of their pizzas for an appetizer which was tasty but the too thin, crispy crust made it hard to eat, broke into pieces. The Asian sliders and hanger steak, both were excellent, but pass on the American sliders and fries. They were okay....could have had more sliders and less fries. It's a bit pricey, but the atmosphere and service were great, and the food is unique and tasty - definitely worth a trip

The House at Dempsey, Singapore serves various food choices that everyone would appreciate. The place is very spacious and is decked with home furniture that gives the ambiance of being in a country house. Dining would be best during daytime since the place overlooks a strip of forest. We ate pasta, pizza, pork slices and chocolate cake for dessert. I like the pizza a lot since they serve Skinny Pizza which is thin crust, crispy and served with generous toppings. From a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the best, I'd say the pasta was around 7. I'd give the fries and the pork slices a rating of around 8 and the dessert would be 7 to 8 (but that would be a bit biased since I was very full when I had the dessert). The staff and the waiting time for the food was fine. I would recommend this place for chilling out and socializing but not for a quick 20-minute lunch since you won't be able to appreciate the place so much

What a place! Such a variety of food & each item is so different with great flavours & textures. I really liked the eclectic decor.

We decided to check out House one Saturday afternoon after learning that our favourite brunch location was overbooked. The menu seemed pretty interesting, but when the dishes were served, it was a reality check: not that it was bad, but it was pretty average, compared to some other places we were used to. Overall still a pretty decent spot, but not for folks who're fussy about their food

My wife and I went last night to celebrate my birthday. We read about this and there was some sort of promotion with a club I somehow became a member of (no idea how). Anyway, the menu looked interesting enough to give it a try. We had a wonderful time. First of all, the food choices we made were very good. We started with pumpkin fries - wierd but really good. For our mains, we ordered the Asian Sliders, a spinach-egg skinny pizza and the baked cod with chorizzo. The Sliders were fantastic with succulent pork belly sandwiched inside chinese pao-type buns. The skinny pizza was guilt-free and quite light. The cod with chorizzo was an interesting and delicious combination. We couldn't finish them all so we doggy bagged them.To go with the meal, we ordered a 2003 malbec for a very reasonable price, which was excellent.We ended the meal sharing a carrot-walnut cake slice and a dark chocolate tart. They were both really good.The decor was very interesting as well, kind of homey and rustic. The only downside was the noise level as the acoustics, with hard floors and glass walls, carried the noise all over the place. There were a few big groups of folks coming from office to have drinks, with the associated clatter and laughter they bring.The service from Bala and Marge was excellent. They took good care of us, recommending dishes and wine, and Bala organized a move to a quieter table when we requested it.Overall, it was great

Lovely atmosphere and plenty of interesting choices for drinks to start, alcoholic and non-alcoholic. I came here for a birthday luncheon and thought the staff was attentive, pleasant and prompt with our large group. My disappointment was with the celeriac soup. The menu says "seared scallops" not "scallop". My soup came with 1 scallop and when I scooped it up with my spoon, to my great disappointment, found I only had the honor of receiving the top 1/4 of the scallop. I've never felt so ripped off at a restaurant. I would have made a fuss but did not want to make the birthday girl feel awkward. I have no plans to return

It was a rainy Thursday evening and we decided to pop in. Love the decoration and atmosphere of the place, it feels cozy with the vintage accessories around.Service was friendly. However i tried the old fashion American slider was not that satisfying as it looked. Ordered the Asian Slider as well, this tasted better. Whats really good was the truffle taro fries. I will come back to try other things, as there are a lot to choose from the menu. I hope it will be better than my last order. Nevertheless, enjoyed the ambiance

Came here on a Friday mid afternoon during the March school holidays for the Vintage High Tea buffet with my husband. Not too sure if it was due to the school holidays, or simply it's a popular high tea (Vintage High Tea buffet is offered only on Thursdays and Fridays), but it was rather crowded. Luckily for us, we were seated right beside the glass doors quite a distance from the buffet table (unlucky for those who are there purely to eat I guess), which is what we prefer anyway as we don't like being near crowds.The buffet table had quite a spread, but I noticed certain things tended to run out very quickly, for example sauteed truffle mushrooms and macaroons. However, these were replenished periodically, though not immediately. It could be due to this reason, that they were wiped out very quickly upon replenishing. We did enjoy the open top sandwiches and mini skinny pizzas, as well as the many desserts. As for the tea, you get 2 choices, and we had ginger tea and chamomile (I think) to pick.Would probably be back again, as the price tag of $25++ per pax is quite reasonable, and my husband likes the quirky furniture. However, would choose a non school holiday if possible

From the moment we arrived we received nothing but the best service so far experienced in Singapore (I have been here for one year now). Extensive menu which made choosing hard but we were all pleased with our choices ...except for one dessert where the person who ordered it thought the caramel dessert would be lovely and gooey but it was quite dry. Loved the ambience of the restaurant and it will definitely be one of my locals

We took a friend for Sunday brunch as a treat and were excited after reading some great on-line reviews. Sadly, the experience was disappointing, despite the staff being friendly and the atmosphere and location being beautiful.Coffees took more than ten minutes to arrive. Same for other drinks. Staff were very obviously disorganised and looked stressed.Food took a long time to come and my organic salmon hash was a small bowl of cream with a few pieces of salmon and potato in it. A bizarre meal to choose and very different to the menu description.The prosecco is nice though

We went to the House at Dempsey Road, the old barracks and had high tea, served between 3 and 5 pm . Excellent savouries plus fabulous small desserts, teas and coffees and eat what you wish. Beautifully presented and though self service buffet style the waiting staff were excellent, taking away plates and refilling water and getting alcoholic drinks as required. Fairly busy so reservation worked well though probably not essential. Wine, as usual in Singapore is expensive, smal glass Sauvignon Blanc 17 Singapore dollars but the price was otherwise good value. High tea all in except alcohol 25 dollars each plus 15 dollars for kids so no complaints from us. The only thing is that the name of the restaurant is not as shown on Trip Advisor but the address and descriptions are for this one. House is the name

Stopped in for Sunday brunch. We sat out on the glassed in deck and I'd reccomend it. The food was great particularly the Asian sliders with taro chips. The cocktails were great: bloody Mary & Madagascar rum and vanilla caprioska. Our four year old had fun and ate everything - always a bonus.
