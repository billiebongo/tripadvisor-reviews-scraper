Once I visited here with my aunt and uncle, and it has very good dining options. Not so expensive yet it so tasty. We lucky to meet the owner, Mr Mak himself. He is very polite person and very friendly.

Mak's Place is an amazing place to eat and have a big family gathering, with lots of authentic local dishes! As a tourist I strongly recommend any visitor to go there and don't forget to try the fried squids.
Just amazing

Had dinner there for 13 pax. Due to last minute reservation we were sat outdoors. But it was ok. Spacious and clean. Food served was fast and piping hot too.Highly recommend the chinese fried rice. Ordered large and came with large prawns and lots of squids etc.. Tom yom broth was thick and flavourful.. Butter squid crispy and nice. Serving was pretty large. Not expensive at all compared to other zhi char.. What i like is they use fresh seafood not frozen.  The only thing is i felt the fish was not fresh. I remembered it was seabass. We ordered sweet n sour and steam fish. Both fish taste very sandy..  I will recommend this place for gatherings etc.. hope to be back there again..

We frequent this f&b. The food is very reasonably priced and has sufficient variety to satisfy the different palates. Service is good and staff are friendly. The husband and wife owner are always cheerful towards the customers. Always take the time to chat with customers and make us feel at home!

Went with colleagues for dinner. Ordered mixed vegetables, luo hai chai, cereal squid, kong bao chicken, salted egg prawn, hotplate tofu, teochew steam fish. Great taste and reasonably priced. They serve warm lime juice in a jug! Bill was about $140++. Staff are helpful and friendly. Toilet is clean. There are a few tables avaliable in the aircon room. Advisable to make reservations if you want to sit in the aircon room

I have been very picky when it comes to food in singapore. Everything is so expensive but only a few is worth the money. Mak's is one of my all time favorite place to eat.I LOVE their CREAMSAUCE CHICKEN($14 good for sharing 2-3 person). I think it's a salted egg yolk base sauce. I order it separate from the sauce to keep it's crunchiness. I also like their buttered squid and cereal squid. Most of the food here is delicious and priced reasonably. The salted fish fried rice is also a must try! For $5 it's helping is very generous, 2 people can share.Over all the food is really great. The place is a bit far from the city though. The downside is that sometimes the servers are a bit snobbish and well if you eat solo it's gonna be pricey since budget should be 14-20 bucks. Overall everything is good! Definitely recommend this place! :

Location is not bad. Got here by bus, alighting at a bustop 2 mins away. 2 types of seating available for customers which is indoor (air-conditioned) and outdoor seating. Do make a reservation first for indoor seating as it is usually very full indoor. Restaurant is suitable for people dining in large groups. Price is reasonable and food is good. Personally recommend the western cuisine - the soup that come alongside the steaks is good. It is a Mushroom soup topped with croutons, very delicious. Chili crab was good and the tom yam soup was not bad. One of the fish dishes however is below average. Cereal prawn is also a recommended dish while dining there. Drinks served are canned drinks and hot beverages. They no longer sell drinks like longan or etc. Had a variety of dishes consisting of a fish, crab, vegetables, soup, 1 western cuisines along with drinks. All of this costs about $130 which is not bad for 9pax. Service is good and waiter is very responsive. Dishes came on time for our break fast

The place doesn't look very appealing, but it serves a variety of local, regional and western cuisines. Everything I've tried was well prepared, the waiting time wasn't long and the prices are very decent. If you want to eat some good local food but you want to be served, choose this place

Went to Mak's Place for the first time today and it will probably be my last. Food is OK and some of the dishes I ordered was good but what really stood out was the rude service. By that I dont mean bad service but a couple of the service staff were unbelievably rude! Really ruined my evening.If the owner of Mak's Place is reading this, I suggest you take a closer look at what is going on in your restaurant. You have a lost a customer

Our most favourite dish each time is their steaming hot fried fish porridge with stir fry beef with ginger & spring onion. Delicious & at most reasonable price. Highly recommendedðŸ˜Š

Every time i visit Singpore, I go to Mak's place. Food is really great there. But you need to have really empty stomach when you are going there, cause dishes are really big, not easy to finish it.

Great food and tasty for a halal-chinese food.
Really love the salted-egg sauce friedd squid.
Highly recommended!

The medium rare sirloin steaks never failed me.
The kids just love its porridge here and the hokkien mee is good.
The Chino is a must here!

This place is especially crowded during Friday evenings because several big groups of muslim patrons dine here. It can be challenging to get the attention of the food attendants, and it will take some time to have your food delivered to your table, but it's gonna be all worth it! Try to get food suggestions from the waitresses if it's your first time to come here, they know better! The owners of this restaurant, and the waitresses are all very nice and accommodating

I remembered when Maks was at the first PKMS building with little staff and busy patrons. The place back then wasn't big nor luxurious but it has a its way to the food being affordable to a schoolboy to have a decent meal.From decent it became a place to chill with camp buddies, late night supper with girlfriends and now a stopover for a small family of mine. Mr Maks is one of the rare owner's who exactly remembers the dishes you normally tuck into and will hint when your changing your palette for another dish of his.Do pardon me as there are occasions of caterpillar found in leafy dishes,watery and tasteless moments of his dishes as orders do come in flocks. Its a forgive and forget situation for all I can remember.The Butter squids, Cereal prawn and the generous spread of goodness in the Maks menu has been mostly being tasted, compared and vetted by my peers and family. All with the same common reaction " better than those Famous Restaurants hands down".I assure your experience may vary from time to time but always, its a 'smile from ear to ear ' after dining. Will continue supporting Maks Place as long as it still stands strong at Changi Road

Last Saturday went for dinner. My son finished his Beef Hor Fun & found a beetle on it. However we feed backed & got a "sorry" reply. My chicken rice's soup was filled with abundant of fried onion, but tasteless.The Chap Choy was plain, not something you would want to order again.I recalled our previous visit before this, our shark fin soup is diluted & tasteless, but this trip is ok.We have been customers for more than 10 years, most of the food is ok, hope they look into details & maintain high standards for their food

Dant believe that they only charge 13$ for a black pepper steak with fries. Also comes on a hot plate. Grilled exactly to my liking ( medium rare). Also the other foods are very good according to my friends who had the other dishes while we were eating there. What makes the dining experience even better is the friendly staff. I saw few cockroaches but what to do... nobody's perfect

Their foods are amazing. Tried their cereal prawn, chilli crab, fried rice, veggies, and some chicken dish. They are all perfectly cooked and come in a generous portion. I regularly eat here when i visited Singapore. And the best thing, their price. Very cheap for Singapore standard

Me and my family frequent this place at least 2 times in a month. First things first, this place is not a real restaurant restaurant its a cross between a restaurant and the commonplace hawker spots you see all over Singapore.This place however has really great food. There are 2 constants that I never fail to order. The Cereal Prawn is as good a cereal prawn as you can find in Singapore. Such a great taste of creaminess while having a crunchy texture from the cereals used. there is also a nice balance of sweetness and the occasional heat from the chillies scattered around the dish. Just FabThe other constant is the Butter squid. Although this might just seem like fried calamari (and in essence it is) It has incredibly crunch and really great butter flavour throughout the dish. Both are definite must tries
