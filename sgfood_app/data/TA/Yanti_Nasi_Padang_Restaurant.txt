Nice tasty and friendly...located in a small shop house along Keong saig rd, not cheap but with authentic Indonesian flavor

One of the authentic nasi padang in Singapore is in here. Price wise is very affordable and quite delicious too. Come early to grab a seat

first time trying this place their rendang and other dishes taste average & pricing higher than other nasi padang shops.
only good thing about this pace is the area & ambience

Great food though not so cheap. Thumbs up for the large choice and the quality of each dish. Longing to go back !

Nearly as good as those days when as a teenager visited Rendevous regularly for they had the best nasi padang then. The chicken curry was fab. The spinach sambal vege. Will go and try the other dishes the next time. The rendang was great but not fantastic. The egg plant was ok due to the spiced chilli didn't penetrate the egg plant.

I'm an avid lover of delicious local food and a frequent visitor of this restaurant (even introduced my family and colleagues to this restaurant), until today.  Place was packed as usual during lunch and there were only a six-seater table left. I happily sat down and enjoyed my meal, not until barely 20 minutes later, I was asked (impolitely) to shift away to another empty table IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MEAL to give up the seat to a big group of new patrons.(by then the other tables have cleared and there were obviously MANY other seats available)  I told the owner politely that I had not finish my meal yet ( half a savoury chicken left untouched). To which, he ridiculously retorted, " But you're sitting there using your phone and you're holding up my business."Right. Because I was using my phone while having my meal and there were so SO MANY OTHER AVAILABLE SEATS LEFT that I had to give up my seat IN THE MIDDLE OF MY MEAL to customers that had not even started their meals yet. This had to be the most disappointed meal by far, and to add salt to the wound, at a dining place I used to enjoy my meals at.  Food is delicious and slightly pricier (which was acceptable), but I'll neither recommend nor patron this place further because of the poor service attitude.Yanti Nasi Padang Restaurant, you'll not be missed.  And for the record, 5 other of your "new patrons" had already joined the 6 seater table that I was sitting at. So technically, they no longer require any additional seats. From a disappointed loyal customer (not anymore

A hole in the wall halal Indonesian restaurant where the Indonesian owner discusses the difference between Islam and Muslim with his Indian and Chinese staff while we eat the room temperature dishes chosen from the display in the window. Tasty green leaves, chicken, fish, eggplants, and the surprisingly complex tofu cooked with lemon grass, green beans, tomato and chili. Not a great fan of tofu generally, but I'd come back for this one anytime

@TheKuoKnowsI have been on a mini-quest for good Nasi Pasang eateries in Singapore. Nasi Padang, which comprises rice with side dishes, originated in the West Sumatran city of Padang. Hence its name. But it is also big part of the Singapore food scene.Nasi Padang can be found in most hawker centres, the ubiquitous shopping-mall food courts and also at the many stand-alone restaurants in and around the Kampong Glam and Geylang areas.A little surprisingly, perhaps, there is a good Nasi Padang restaurant, Yanti, which is located on one of the backstreets of Chinatown - along Keong Saik Road.The humble cafe-style diner, which nestles conspicuously between upmarket eateries and trendy watering holes, serves Indonesian-style Nasi Padang. There are lots of mouth-watering dishes on display. The difficulty is in choosing what to leave out rather than what to order.Purists claim there are subtle differences between the Indonesian version and the Malay style of Nasi Padang. I am not quite at that level of sophistication, yet. But I can vouch for Yanti's food quality. It is undeniably good.The Beef Rendang was moist and fragrant. The Achar pickles looked innocently tame but it took off the roof of my mouth in double-quick time. Thank goodnes for the milder side order of vegetables.Yanti is priced slightly higher than your typical hawker-centre Nasi Padang outlets. A meal for one could cost around $8, which is not an outrageously-high price to pay for a tasty meal in what was once one of Singapore's most infamous streets!

I paid $9.50 for a plate of Nasi Padang (1 meat + 3 veges), which would probably only cost $5-$6 at a hawker centre. Was the food any better? Not really. Was the environment nicer? Well, it's a self-service, non air-conditioned eatery. So why am I paying a premium? Because it's Keong Saik Street, the over-priced, over-gentrified hipster enclave of Chinatown. Period.

Straight up one of the best malay/indo places to grab a quick and delicious meal. Prices at the higher end for hawker nasi padang fare but food makes up for it. Curmudgeonly old malay aunties serving food can be cantankerous....requests for extra gravy are met with scorns of derision....even if you offer to pay extra. Wouldnt go out of my way for it but if youre at keong saik road you could do a lot worse than Yanti's
