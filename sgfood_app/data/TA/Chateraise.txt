I used to be a big fan if Beard Papa which serves freshly made cream puffs but this is though it's not freshly made on the spot, tastes much smoother. Thoroughly enjoyed by both young and old in the family.

the cream puffs we bought served as great snacks in office - we bought the mango flavoured puffs, and you could actually taste the mango pieces within; wasn't too sweet too.

Various dessert, GOSH!! I tried the double chou cream, it is to die for! The staffs also so efficient and fast. Recommended.

They sell a variety of cakes and pastries but the best we like are the cream puffs, which are sealed individually and come with various flavours including mango and matcha. These are best eaten chilled.They also have ice cream cones, which are a hit with the kids.You can also order drinks like Americano and vanilla lattes, if you want to sit in the dining area

Had seen this franchise in March. Decided to try it in July. I think they do the best cakes in Singapore. Very nice choices. They also do Nama chocolate - one of the best chocolates one can have. They are half the price of Royce though Royce does a bigger selection. The company has 3 shops and numerous franchises. It is unfortunate that franchises do not carry enough Nama chocolate stock.

Visited the shops at HDB Hub and Square 2. Small shops, one payment counter but there are two queues depending on products one is purchasing. This is confusing for customers and there is standing room only in both shops with queuing area in the corridor outside the shop. The staff are all behind the counters at both shops, seem disorganized, and have deadpan faces, and customers are expected to decide what to buy just by looking at the product label in the display. My experience after patronizing both shops, at non peak periods, on different days: (a) Some of the packaged cream puffs and sliced swiss rolls have expiry dates on same day of purchase or the following day, but there was no indication on the product display or from the staff and I had no chance to look at the fine print on the plastic wrapping till I unpacked the items in the shopping bag later.(b) taste wise, there were hits and misses. The cream puffs and ice creams were not bad for the price point. The sliced cakes looked tempting in the window display but I found them too sweet and had too much cream in proportion to the cake itself. The texture of some products such as the chocolate cake were dry and coarse.(c) the staff packs your purchases tightly into the flimsy cardboard cartons and plastic bags. Good to be eco-friendly but a creamy, animal-faced cake that I had bought for a child was smudged due to careless and shoddy packing by the salesperson at the HDB Hub outlet (see self explanatory photo).Average quality products, priced for the mass market, Chateraise is new to the local market and that was what enticed me to buy and try their products. Some of the products are overrated, the customer experience is underwhelming for a Japanese brand, and there are plenty of other choices in Singapore even for products at the same price point

I have been to this pastry shop many times and loved their fresh cream pastries. I have tried different ones and they've all been great on taste. But the last time I visited I was even more impressed because my eyes fell on a small poster near the cash register (see attached foto). It was about a cake they had which was wheat free, dairy free and egg free. I have a celiac at home and was already sold on 'wheat free' but thought it's great to have to fresh cake (not frozen) which could make many kids happy. We ordered for a slice. The full cake needs to be pre ordered a day before. The strawberry on the cake comes separately packed. We took it home and tried it... super yum and my kid didn't have any trouble later on. This one is definitely the top of my list for pastry shops in Singapore.

I tried some of the on the shelf's product but that is all average. My client bought us the puff and apparently it tasted quite good. Since that is the signature item, so i gave the 4 stars based on the puff. I always see pretty cakes in the glass cabinet. Try that next time

I only happened to try the cream puff as they were allowing tastings. It tasted really nice so i decided to go for a green tea one. Its basically a large profiterole with green tea and plain cream inside. They also do ice cream, i had the coffee flavour and it was good!RegardsOma

Discovered this patisserie from Japan while shopping at NEX shopping mall (retail therapy). Tried the steamed bun of milk with red bean ice cream and the lemon cake. If you takeaway the ice cream, they do provide a small pack of ice. Love the packaging and the ice cream is so smooth and milky. So yummy. The lemon cake is also very delicious. I will definitely come back to try other products
