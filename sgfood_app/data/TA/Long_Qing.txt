This was last dinner in Singapore 2017.
That's why I was going to go back to Japan after having dinner.
That is good enough to have dinner as special night.
Thank you for good food and service!

Must try the Mushroom soup and the Mala soup. However, the Mala soup is rather oily. Go in a big group to get savings on the set course.
3
I love their service and ambience. In terms of the food, I feel the soup was average. Their pricing is a little high.
3
Good ambience, good food. Air-conditioned with ample space btwn each tables. But the food was expensive for its portion.
4
Fresh greens and friendly staff. Nice ambience and not too big place, thus not too noisy.
Had herbal and mushroom soup.
Like the mushroom soup more.
The place is suitable for small group of 2-4pax.
Menu choices are standard hotpot menu.

Mala soup was mediocre as with most of the ingredients, was expecting fresher after seeing reviews was gd. Mushroom soup was not bad though, sweet and fragrant. Overall some hits and misses, only impressive cuts of beefs and scallops was impressionable, not sure if justify for the slight steep pricing though

I was there with my wife as she loved the food there. The hotpot soup base we ordered were both excellent. The tomato broth had chunks of tomatoes and you could taste the sweet and sour flavors while the lotus root soup was equally rich and fragrant. The offerings they have for the hotpot was not as varied as HaiDiLao but each one of it was fresh! I had an Angus sliced beef and it was so delicious with the broth.I would recommend this place to anyone who wants something as good if not better than HDL.

Their mushroom soup base was really excellent, no msg, very flavourful, and tastes even better after cooking the meat on it. Their dumplings are really good too. Overall fresh ingredients but I find that it was just a tad too expensive to be able to enjoy this regularly.
3
I think the restaurant did not had enough staff to serve the customers. Despite telling the staff that we wanted to take our orders, we waited for 15 mins before being served. There wasnt alot of variety to chose from and the soup was not as good as other hotpot places. Overall it was a disappointment

Read about rave reviews and decided to try since near office to celebrate colleague's birthday. Staff was good and patient to recommend what to order since three ladies and first time trying. All of us liked the wild mushroom soup very much but the sharks fin melon soup was too thick with sweet herbs tasted weird. Ordered 2 persons set + ala carte japanese giant squid, prawn and fish paste. Fish, lamb and beef slice in the set all not edible as fishy and foul smell especially the lamb. Lucky that was the last item added into the soup cos only 1 person eating and even the soup tasted bad after that. However, the ala-carte items were fresh and good (has to be as not cheap). Overall, not fantastic and difficult to maintain food freshness if there is no constant crowd so it really depends on luck on the day itself whether the food are newly stocked or left overnight
3
Food was just okay, nothing extraordinary. Good if you are in dire need of a hotpot place in the city. Then again, cheaper options and probably more sumptuous alternatives nearby.
5
Made a reservation to this cosy restaurant. The soup base was amazingly good. After the dinner, we didnt feel thirsty at all. Ingredients were fresh, but it is on a high side price. Definitely will visit again
5
Ma la soup is not as hot as we want to but we can TOP up the hotness. The mushroom soup is excellent, sweet, and very salt. Just nice. The set portion is good for 2.
4
Food was very fresh. Chef took alot of effort in the preparation of the meat. Soup was tasty as well.
5
Good ambiance, great service and good food. Broth is less oily compared to other Mala hotpot place. Broth contains herbal ingredients and is healthy
5
We had Wild Mushroom and Mala for our two soup bases.
It was delicious! Wide range of meat and vegetable to choose from the menu.
4
Overall service is good, best to make reservation especially on Friday. The pork collar is a must order.
3
Food quality is good. Soup broth is RICH. But we really feel ‚Äúrobbed‚Äù. For 2 pax and we didn‚Äôt even order beef or seafood, just LOTS OF VEGGIES, one plate of pork Shabu Shabu, 2 fish paste and 1 porkball and a 300ml Sake @$28 and the bill was $180!!
3
The food is ok. The atmosphere is ok. Service is average. Nothing special..Still far from i expected.
3
There was a power outage during the meal but staff was quick to resolve it. ingredients were of pretty good quality, especially the meats and the wild mushroom soup was really delicious. We had the ma la broth too but felt it could have been more flavourful. Overall a great place for hotpot :
4
Had the Tuesday offer of 1-1meats. Ordered the beef. When asked to spice up the soup, the server did as requested. Mushroom stock is very good.
5
Been back repeatedly. Loved the choices of broth freshly made and options for selection. A great place to go with family & friends
3
Mala soup base in not fantastic. Food portion is small and quality of food does not match up to the price. I also feel they are short-handed and friendliness of staffs need to be improved.
5
Have wide variety of food to choose from, good quality meat, and soup base with no MSG. Very pleasant experience
4
The mushroom soup is superlicious! Food is yummy as well! Service is great, very friendly! Recommended!
4
This is my fifth visit since early of this year. Simply loved their Mala Hot pot. Fresh foods are being offered here. Service level was great too. The prawn paste is one of the best.
4
2nd time at LongQing. Attentive service by the crew. Ingredients are fresh, and with a decent selection. Portions are on the small side for set menu.
4
Enjoyed the night out with friends surrounding a large pot of tomato and mala soup. Lots of goodies to throw into that pot and all were good, even the luncheon meat! Only sad to know that we need to pay for water ... it's a personal pet peeve. It's just water, we paid for a lot of stuff already, we're not in Europe, might as well generate some good will. But that's a super minor complaint
3
The food was not bad but the portion size was way too small and overpriced. Clearly understaffed on a Thursday night and we had to wait a while for our food to arrive. Air-conditioned place so it's not warm while having the hotpot. Spent around $55/pax.
5
Food is of good quality and most importantly, not frozen. Unlike places like Tamyoto which serves everything frozen, the quality of food here is great. The fish are sliced beautifully too. Their signature mushroom soup is actually very delicious. On Tuesday, there is an offer for one-for-one meat items. So order a meat and get another free. That's a good deal
5
The meats were of great quality, as well as the service. Definitely one of the better hotpot places in Singapore
4
Great quality of food and absolutely love the soup bases! The restaurant also had a relaxing ambience. Would definitely patronise again! :)
5
Hidden treasure cooking pleasure. Delicious mushroom soup base with no msg. And the spicy version is yummy and meets the numbing standards of mine. Definitely a return location.
4
Good customer service, atmosphere was great. The food was fresh. The price a little bit pricey which you can go for a buffet steamboat alternatively. Overall experience was great.
5
It's broth are without MSG, really good for any type of gatherings and the location is fantastic too!
4
Good service and good food. Don't miss it. Worth going but better to make reservation as there will be a queue if you just walk in.
4
Went on a Tuesday evening. Place was nice, service was good. The mala and wild mushroom soup bases were excellent! :)
3
the meat is very thinly sliced (which is good). however too few slices.
the table is also too small for comfort.
for the kind of price, one can top up abit and go to hai di lao.
4
Location is easy to find. The staff is friendly and helpful. The mushroom soup and mala soup base is good. Beef and pork was okay. Can go their facrbook to check promotion. Like Tuesday is buy one get one free for near section. Maybe have another choices? Such as beauty in the pot or haidilao? Since the price is almost same.
5
Would recommend popping over to Long Qing if you're ever near the boat quay / clarke quay area as they serve an authentic ma la hotpot with a great selection of meat, seafood and vegetables. Look for Johnson and ask for extra spicy if you're in the mood for a real blast! Would recommend the beef short ribs and mangalista pork. Other soup broths offer an interesting pairing but go for the spicy ma la to truly enjoy the experience.
4
The price for the set menu is affordable and quality of the ingredients are fresh. Good for gathering.
5
Very clean and tidy place, food is good. Comfortable environment, friendly boss. Though price is little on the high side, but I will be back again for sure.
4
Mushroom soup is good no msg. We went on Tuesday, there is 1 for 1 for meat. place is cosy too however make reservations.
5
Top hotpot places in my list. One of the best I have ever been to. Love the beef and pork, dumplings, prawns and the pork balls! üëçüèº
4
As subject, environment is good, not too crowded not room noisy, food is nice as well, would be even better if got more meat options to choose from
5
We had the seafood broth which needs to be ordered a day in advance. The lobster meat was fresh and oh so good. Ingredients for the seafood set was value for money at $78. Ample food for 4 of us.
2
Lacking in quality of meat- served frozen, soy sauce was diluted, waitress explained they dilute with water to reduce saltiness), mala soup was bland, had to ask for additional spices. Portion of food was also very little. 4 slices of pork for set meal.
5
Visited Long Qing with friends based on good reviews online. What got our attention was that their soups have no MSG. We had the Sharkfin Melon soup (a type of melon and not the real shark) and a mushroom soup. We ordered the S$89 set for two and added a few more dishes which was extremely hearty. We paid some S$45 per person which was reasonable. We will return to taste the other soups again
4
The food provided are fresh, choose of soup base are not limited. Me and my friends really enjoyed the 2 types of special soup base mainly the Wild Mushroom and the Melon Herbal Soup? Unfortunately, the service provided on that day was average. I guess they'll down staff and it was a Saturday. Environment was ok, but I think the restaurant could have been bigger so that they can hold more tables. Generally everything was great. Loved the soup base, loved the food just that maybe it was a little overprice but defiantly worth the try and comeback!

We went on weekday during lunch time, and there is coporate lunch available at around S$19 per person (after GST). This restaurant doesn't charge service charge. We tried the Mala and wild mushrooms soup. Both taste nice. The set lunch also include drinks and rice. Overall it was a great experience
