Had our annual family lunch at Triple 3 Restaurant this Chinese New Year. There was festive decoration at hotel lobby and in the restaurant.Food spread was a wide selection of fresh cold seafood like oysters, mussels, prawns and cran legs; grilled beef, honey baked ham, 2 soup varieties-lobster bisque and cream of mushroom; Japanese tempura and sashimi; Indian, Chinese and international cooked dishes. More than enough to fill our stomachs.Place to consider coming with your family considering that there is a 1-for-1 promotion going on with local credit cards
4
Amazing spread and well delectable dishes. Look out for their Parma ham wrapped lychee fruits - decadent. Many live stations and oysters galore
4
 A large, busy cafe/restaurant attached to the Mandarin Orchard hotel located on the 5th floor just opposite the reception area. Serves up a good self service buffet that caters equally for both Western and Asian guests with a great selection, reminiscent of many cruise ships
3
The serving portion was not generous at all despite paying a high price for the buffet.. Sashimi and wagyu beef have to keep going to the counter to take cos their staff are 'caring ' to their boss to serve the patrons such small portion. 为何不舍得给顾客吃 晚餐也不便宜啊. anyway 食物也不是很好吃。wagyu 还好 oysters 也不是很新鲜。5/10 价格不值得品尝
4
Visited this place twice, and this time reserved for a big group and staff is kind enough to do a reservation for us immediately. Lobster, crabs and prawns were the main stars but there are lots of choices available as well: japanese, chinese, indian and local delights. Desserts are overflowing.
3
Sate your appetite with japanese, chinese and western cuisine. Place gets very packed on weekends and dinners

Came for dinner on 24 Feb specially for the Aomori theme, but was disappointed that the theme ended early and i was not informed. The Kumamoto beef carving that night is also disappointing. The cut is not good and worse of all, when the roast beef carving ran out, it was replaced by normal beef steaks.By far my most disappointing trip to triple three. A let down after all the great visits previously
3
Expectation on Food variety was not met. Especially with such high price in such a 5star Hotel.Fortunately it was a Lunch Promotion with a 1 for 1.Food was just so..so.! Sashimi was served at only 4 slice by the staff at each time after a long queue
5
Great buffet spread . Fantastic service. I frequent here at least once every three months. Great Job Roger and Team...apologies i not able to remember all the staff name...kudos to one of the indian specs asst mgr guy as well. See u all again soon

It must be 3 years since I last visited this eatery. A well organised sections n sections of free flow of good quality food. A section of teppanyaki Wagyu beef n prawns with bean sprout fried was busy all night.A section of cold meat, salad section cum with Japanese delicacies of sashimi, massive plates of sushi followed by two chefs freshly opening Irish oysters. There’s also good Alaska crabs, kind prawns. Hi light of the buffer was the baked lobsters ! Free flow. There’s also an Indian section.Overall 8/10Quality of good 8/10Ambience. 4/10 - seats were simply too close to one another with no privacy of a chatService 8/10Keep up the good quality of food here & tops in Service with a smile.

A terrific wide ranging breakfast which changed slightly everyday. I like that they had changed as when you are staying for a little while it does make it more interesting, had eastern porridge station. Three different types of raw fish - snow, tuna and mackerel. Roast potatoes, omlets and eggs. Chefs at stations could be more service oriented but otherwise very nice
1
We tried booking this place since December 2017, finally found an an available date. Thinking that it's such a hot spot, must be a good experience. When we arrived, we were shocked to see long queues for the food. Food quality was meh. Service was lousy. At the tail-end of lunch session, food replenishment was slow and staff seemed unwilling to top up, we literally had to ask for food like pathetic beggars. Charging $118++ per pax is outrageous, then only we understood why they have 1-for-1 promotion for selected credit cards. I won't return even if it costs quarter of the price or less, waste of calories
4
Everything was perfect except for 1 tiny matter. We asked for 3 hot water and would thought they would serve the hot water in a jug with 3 cups like chinese tea style. Instead, we have 3 glasses... luke warm. A moment later, they filled up the glass with really hot water in the glass. couldn't even hold onto the glass. Other then the hot water issue.... there is nothing to complaint about
4
My wife and I come here at least once every 3-4 months. The selection changes only slightly but we are not complaining. The Teppanyaki is really good: succulent shelled prawns and tender beef cubes. Sushi variety is excellent and Sashimi is fresh although the cuts of fish could be better. Tempura is good as well. Love the prawns which are covered with just the right amount of batter. Other dishes we enjoyed: Indian Chicken Tikka and Chinese Stir-fried Vegetables. If you enjoy meat dishes, the carving station features at least two meats (Roast Beef and Leg of Ham are our faves). The reason why we gave a 4-star rating and not a 5-star one is because the desserts are very average. Tip: Ask for a table away from the Teppanyaki station of you will end up smelling like a smoky BBQ
5
Great ambience, excellent service from staff and quality food! 1 for 1 buffet price was very worth it. International cuisines available

Triple Three Restaurant at Mandarin Hotel has always been my favourite buffet place to bring friends and business clients. However, my recent experiences at the location were severely upset by the Kagoshima Wagyu Beef station.Overall, the restaurant food and service level remain high, but at the Kagoshima Wagyu Beef station when my overseas clients were humiliated by the young chief who is in charge, keep providing us with precooked, cold, harden beef. When we request him to make a new dish from the Wagyu Beef on the table, he repeatedly refused, giving all questionable excuses, claiming those Wagyu Beef are just for show. Instead, taking hidden beef beneath under a white cloth and lied to my guests the meat he is providing is the same on the table. Regrettably, my business clients experience F&B owners. We are not sure if this was the doing of the young chef, or it is how Triple Three Restaurant does their business, seemingly, a cheap way to cut cost under the table
3
Food was decent variety of food was not extensive but we'll curated. Service acceptable for the crowd and staff coped as best they could
3
Food variety are quite limited as compared to other hotel buffet. Food freshness are of good standard
4
Great place to dine or have lunch with your colleagues, peers and business partners. Well prepared for families as well. Food and service quality are quite good. Great seafood and sushi 
3
Food is so so. The Tempura is fried pretty slowly. The beef slices are over seasoned with Oyster sauce
5
My godmaâ€™s and myself celebrated our birthday at Triple 3. The food spread were very good and the waitress serves us well. My Godma and I each had our complimentary slice of birthday cake and they serve us along with a birthday song. This makes us so shy but we were very happy, Thank you Triple 3 And Team
5
I have been to this buffet restaurant many times. The first time could be dated back to 2009. This restaurant used to be famous for its good quality buffet, however since frequently 1 for 1 discount is always on, the quality is dropped. This time, I found it is back to certain standard! With a wide range of selection, food quality is very satisfying. average cost per person is around 80. Due to festival season, it is a little bit crowded
4
Was here for family birthday celebration and was not disappointed. Have tried buffet at other hotels but Triple Three is really quite good. Fresh seafood, oysters, salmon etc! They are also having some promotion now with 2nd pax at 50% off. Quite a good deal! Recommended! (Even though some service crew does not seem to be well trained
3
The food are not bad can try it again. The price are not that expensive. Service are very good and the atmosphere is good
1
Instant coffee is the default served at breakfast. Other coffee offered at a cost. Nowadays no hotel serves Instant coffee. Only some 35 years ago in China in the third tier cities maybe
5
Quality of food is good. Seafood is freshly served. Not a wide range of varieties but still adequate. Staff is attentive but lack of wine knowledge
2
Food was so-so. Seafood : Oysters bland, not sweet/juicy. Only Snow crab legs, not Alaskan king crab, Yabbies blandSeared scallop was goodCooked food: Teppanyaki beef was goodSoup served was cream of asparagus / miso only? Sad.Desserts: In the beginning it looked good, after people took their servings, no top-up was done. We were left with measly choices. Ambience: So-so. There was a very noisy table of 8-10 next to us. They were screaming & shrieking at the top of their lungs after some wine and just being a nuisance to the rest of the tables around them. I nicely feedback to the Manager in a suit to get them to quiet down abit, but he gave me the reluctant face and did not do anything. *sigh*. Not totally his fault, but pls be abit more proactive. Almost puked everytime the Ah Lian-Auntie tried to break her pitch record. Sorry I won't be revisiting this place anytime soon
3
Waited a long time before the Alaskan king crab legs are refilled. The desserts choice was quite limited.
3
I had dinner here recently with my family. Nice ambience and fast service - although sometimes the waitresses clear my plate before im done with the food. Enjoyed the lobsters, crab legs, teppanyaki beef and pasta (cooked on the spot). Not a wide selection ( seafood/cheese/dessert) to choose from but overall a good experience
3
 The spread was ok with a lot of varieties but small portions. Overall the food favouring is quite salty.
4
A friend of mine invited us to dine at the Triple Three at Mandarin Orchard Singapore on 24 November 2017.What makes this hotel different from the others is that almost every station here is a live station. There is a standby Chef who would prepare the food in front of you hence the food you get is served piping hot.While the seafood is fresh and the Chef would brush your oysters before serving them to you, the taste is generally average. The price is on the high side though because you are paying for the chefs at the many live stations
5
My friends and I went to Triple Three to celebrate the birthday of one of us on a Tuesday evening, where they were having the Foie Gras special. The Foie Gras was excellent in taste and the live teppan station where it served succulent beef, prawns, bean sprouts etc added to sumptuous spread. The waiters were attentive to our needs & readily cleared the emptied plates. A complimentary cake with the name of the birthday boy was presented with the staff singing a birthday song. Appreciated the effort
4
Went on a Wed (their Wagyu beef special). The beef was nothing to about about. The seafood (sashimi, oysters, crabs) was much better! The service staff was excellent. Tables are a bit too close to each other
5
I always hear my uncle saying that good food and unlimited wagyu, prawns, and many too mention. For me I like Prata, corn ice cream and sashimi salmon and tuna it was fresh
3
Doesnt seem worthy enough for the Hokkaido Harvests theme. But good to see raclette cheese, which comes with potato or corn (both are nice). Raclette cheese serving could have been better if more is given. Overall, buffet variety not alot, especially the Hokkaido Harvests items, nothing too special. Oysters are fresh, but long queue due to on-the-spot opening of oyster shells. Crabs also nothing much to boast about. Probably other buffets will be better
3
The variety spread ainâ€™t worth spending not going down to try even once. The buffet spread is so limited that I could finish the buffet spread in less than 15 mins inclusive of chit chatting with my family.
3
Unless you are a cold seafood lover I wouldn't suggest for you to visit this place. They only had 2 aisles of food giving you very limited choices. However the saving grace would be the freshness of the seafood and the staff service. A hefty price point where you could definelty find another restaurant value for your money
2
The Hokkaido Harvest Buffet is from 17 to 29 Oct. It is a thumping $40 more than the usual Wednesday buffet dinner and $20 more as compared to normal weekend price. Not really worth to pay so much more for this special Harvest Buffet. Food is good but is very much controlled especially the expensive stuffs like oysters, Alaskan crab legs and sashimi. The chef tightly controlled the oyster servings when you go back for second helping, he will remind you and said, "This is your second round right?". After a while they stop replenishing the Alaskan crab leg, so help yourself to that station early. The roast beef is over cooked, imagine at the colour at the centre of the slab of beef is not pink but dark colour. The portion at the side is dark and hard like rubber. It is a total waste of money. Avoid such theme buffet
4
We are using UOB credit card promotion 1 for 1 , Value for money , good food , good service and good atmosphere
1
Was looking forward to the Hokkaido feast this year as I was there last year. The spread this year was not as good as last year and quite limited. The sashimi is fresh but portion quite small. They did not replenish much Crabs. The crabs were gone within mins. The oysters were open on the spot but however I encounter 1-2 oysters that were not so fresh . Price was also higher for 2 as manage to get 50% discount for second diners for selected card but I remember there was 1 for 1 for dinner last year for selected card . Hope that they can improve the buffet spread for next year as the price for the buffet isn’t cheap and we will expect better buffet spread and quality . I believe many diners there are usually the yearly regulars waiting for this Hokkaido feast and it will be sad to lose more Customer year after year
4
Good food and great service. Only hitch was we were using the crab cracker when they asked if they could have it back as another customer needed it and they don't have enough! Appalling for a high class restaurant like this.
1
Hokkaido themed buffet with the family. A grand feast. Food selection aplenty. Some yummy, some so-so, some .What made for a disappointing end was the service carrying out silly management rules.1. When we asked for 1 missing welcome drink for my Mum who came later, they say there is "No More". They are told to stop service for the welcome drink . Not very nice of telling us. Waiter was questioned why and he then grudgingly got my Mum her drink. 10mins later he served a table behind us 6 welcome drinks.2. They advertised that there was a lucky draw to win a pair of air tix to Hokkaido. They were 10 of us dining and so I thought I would have 10 forms. But they say no. It is 1 lucky draw form per table!?!? Which again is absolutely silly and unfair. A table of 10pax versus 2pax coming back 5x to eat. Furthermore it is a lucky draw not a lucky dip. Meaning if you had 100 forms or 1000 forms it did not matter because you are only giving away 1 pair of tickets. So why annoy a customer over this?Anyway sometimes a good marketing idea/concept can be tainted with poor execution.My family has swear off Mandarin Orchard triple three and they only want ShangRiLa The Line buffet
3
Im not hard to please but I came for the king crabs and i got a plate full of them. Problem is they were ice frozen, solid frozen. I had to left them on the plate to let them defroze for 30mins, which then the crabs are edible but still icy and eating them wasnt enjoyable.
5
Great food especially the lobster...yum... Courteous service and a real deal value for your money. Ambiance was condusive for catching up with friends.
5
The servers are very attentive and top up our drinks and cleared our plates promptly. The team at triple 3 also surprised me with a birthday cake and a birthday song. Such a sweet gesture from them
3
Booked the place for family dinner. Ambience for the place was good, service as well but was quite disappointed with the selection of food.
5
"Celebrated my anniversary with my partner at Triple Three. We enjoyed very much the buffet spread. Varieties of International/Asian spread like Indian,Japanese,Chinese,Western available. Perhaps maybe rice should be included for lunch buffet maybe? Dessert was good,not too sweet and in right portion (not too big). We didnt had enough space to fill in for the complimentary cake for our anniversary (tho the cake was quite big portion and a little dry) Overall lunch worth the ambience,price (one for one deal for selected cards),food. Will definitely make a come back. My partner like it alot"
3
Variety of seafood was not as much as expected. Variety of dessert offered was limited. Taste of the food that was offered was good though
4
I have been visit dinner on 2nd Oct 2017 with my friends. I was very disappointed with the seafood especially oyster it’s was very smelly after i eat that!! It feel very awkward and make me feel uncomfortable
4
Its one of the highly recommended buffet in singapore... The varieties are very all at its best... i love the grill Miso foie Gras , risotto in truffles & Royal Foie Gras ... Seafood is the bes
5
Food was good High quality foodFirst time visitNot disappointed at allWill go back againDinner was for my two good frens They enjoyed it as wel
5
I absolutely loved the food! They had a wide range consisting of Indian and Western cuisine, but the best was definitely the Japanese area which they are known for. The live cooking stations filled the air with pleasant smells and it was great to see your food being prepared. Even the sushi was freshly rolled! There was a drinks area too, with hot and cold drinks like coffee, teas and milo. The dessert section had local delights and it was all delicious. Service was great, with the waiters coming to refill our glasses and clear our plates often so we didn't have to worry about our table being cluttered
3
Staff service was good. Expected more in the choices of selection in the buffet line. I was there about 2-3 years back , remembered it was more.
3
Was disappointed with the variety and spread of food. Quality is not great too on some of the food. If it is not because of the 1-for-1 promotion, it is really not worth the money ($78++ per pax). The place is nice and comfortable though.
5
Food is good, will go there when there is a celebration again! My birthday ladies enjoyed. Price is on the high side though
5
I went for this buffet on a friday night, hence I got to enjoy the free-flow of lobster mentaiyaki - which was simply scrumptious. The lobster meat, albeit a little tough, was extremely succulent and well coated with the mentaiko sauce. It was undoubtedly one of my favourite part of this buffet. The live teppanyaki hot plate cooking of beef was also really impressive, with the chunks of beef being amazingly tender and juicy - so, so good! The cold seafood was extremely fresh as well, especially the oysters which had many people queuing up for. Overall, this buffet is a rather extensive one, with their seafood and grilled meats being the main star of the buffet. The desserts, however, were sadly quite mediocre and the variety of the desserts/fruits section was lacking. Maybe they could include a chocolate fondue with strawberries station or a free flow soft-serve/frozen yogurt machine? (since the buffet isn't cheap, we should end off our meal with some good dessert haha) Hopefully the next time I visit, there would be a greater variety of desserts for the sweet tooth
2
I just finished my buffet lunch with my in-laws n cousins. The food quality is ok, especially the prawn tempura which is fresh & tasty. But it lacks variety. The restaurant is quite crampy.Overall this is the poorest experience l had among the 5-stars hotels l have been to. Definitely won't re-visit
4
This is a good buffet, the spread is good quality, not the best, but better than many other hotels in town. The price and credit card promotions are a big drawer so it gets packed.
4
Japanese buffet. Good variety. Fresh food. Prompt service. Crowded but the restaurant is nicely decorated
3
Visited this restaurant close to 8.45pm with 3 other family members. The spread was reasonably good but service could have been better. The used plates were not collected on a few occasions especially towards the closing time between 9.30pm - 10pm. The counter serving staff were also busy preparing for closure despite the last order was 9.45pm.
4
There are a lot of variety, all fresh but I do not see anything really special. Like any other ordinary international buffet
4
I think the food here is the one of the top quality in Singapore. However, it is a bit crowded. Overall, the food and service was quite satisfactory
4
Probably one of the most expensive buffet for lunch or dinner but the quality of food - fresh n good. Good spread n variety - ASIAN, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and others. And also fried food stations. Good roasted lamb. Good desserts n fruits as well. Can be crowded. Advance booking needed
3
Food and all were good but we were seated opposite a big group of probably like 20 people who came together. They really spoilt the evening as they were extremely noisy. They made so much noise and became a nuisance to all the other guest
5
We were had the ubiquitous buffet on a week night. As it has always been, the food quality was superb, the spread was equally great and sumptuous. We enjoyed the Wagyu beef cooked in different ways, the seafood and sashimi were fresh (though the oysters could be bigger). The snow crabs were succulent and sweet. The ice cream popsicle was nice and refreshing, the after dinner treats like cheese and crackers and desserts were not to be missed.We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the buffet and look forward to our nice visit
3
2 timeS visited. Food Quality is good but varieties is limited. Service level so-so. Atmosphere is not quite.
4
Waitress and Chefs/cooks were friendly. Very good selection of food. We love the barbecue pork ribs so much. Desserts were fantastic
5
Good experience. Friendly staff and decent quality of food. Will visit again for buffet dinner soon
4
We went there for my frd bday the food variety is quite wide. Fresh n nice place for chill outs. Service is great

1. When I arrive, my appointment through Chope was not found. As I have written remarks for "window seating" when I made a reservation, I did not get to sit at my preferred seats. Before I was being seated, I ask if they could arrange me to have the window seats, they told me that it has been reserved. So they have placed me near to the smokiest place of the restaurant. I left the restaurant like as if I went for a BBQ dinner.2. I went for the "Foie Gras" theme buffet. This is my first time visiting Triple Three. I would say that the service was not up to standard. For the price that you are paying, it is not worth it, the food variety could have been better. 3. There is a station for hot beverages serving coffee, Milo... I am a Tea person. However, there is only English Breakfast Tea available. It could be good if more choices of tea could be served
4
Celebrated my Son birthday at triple three restaurant. Food variety is good. Quality is above average. On the pricey side
3
Review by Dr Sim. The buffet is generally good. One or two items not quite up to expectation. The price is a bit expensive. Service is good. Can consider going if there is a promotion from the credit cards. Regards Dr Si
4
Seafood is good especially Oyster are very fresh. Wide variety of Dessert ï¼Œvalue for Money with credit card promotion .
3
This restaurant pale in comparison with other buffet restaurant. Main set back is that it does not have a lot of variety. Some food need to queue and items are controlled
5
First of all, the dinner buffet isn't cheap. I was given a treat for my birthday and the rack rate for one is $108 before any tax and service charge. Hunt around for a promotion and you might get up to 50% off your meal.Quick summary:- Not a lot of variety BUT the available spread is of high quality- Snow Crabs and King Crabs are my favourite and i can't help but notice them replacing King Crab legs with Snow Crab legs when the King Crab legs ran out. - Live Oysters are available but not my cup of tea- Prawns, smaller crabs and crayfish are also available but I only had eyes for the King and Snow Crabs- Grilled Lobsters available but you have to have fast fingers - Limited variety of drinks from the hot beverage dispenser. - Cocktails are chargeable- No Durian dessert (My biggest disappointment
2
Lunch buffet was disappointing. Quality of food was not as expected , and portions of the meat servings were small 
4
the chilli crab sauce prawn was superb! the food overall was standard, a bit overprice, but I was there for DBS promotion so it was okay.
5
There is something for every one and with variety.Wait staff is very courteous and pleasant to deal with
3
Overall, the best food of the night was the beef. Could have more varieties such as satay or provide different types of drinks instead of just coffee and plain water
4
Reservation using Chope was hassle free. Got immediate response on confirmation of reservation. Will book using Chope again!!!!
4
Customer friendly restaurant serving very good quality food such as pan fried wayu beef, fresh prawns, giants scallops and oven baked lobsters. I truly enjoyed the buffet dinner with my family
5
Great service and spread. Beautiful ambience and easily accessible. A wonderful experience and highly recommend this place to familie
5
If you're finding a place with a variety of food and will be willing to pay, this place will be just for you.
5
Very helpful and courteous staff. We have enjoyed the food very much too. The birthday boy was delighted
4
The good is excellent; the variety very good. The food is Suitable for both adults as well as children.
5
Triple tree offer a very nice buffet yet affordable with the 1 for 1 promotion.Will visit again very soon
4
Variety may not be a lot compare to other hotels buffet but there are 15 stations to choose from including beverages, ice cream, assorted breads, fruits. So narrow down to 11 stations with 'proper food'. Food was with 'premium' ingredients or should I say better, like including fish roe in some food.Prompt in clearing the finished plates. Polite and greets patrons with smile
3
Quality of food was good but variety was very limited for lunch. Triple Three is known for its seafood but there was barely any good seafood at lunch
4
Quality of the food is good but the variety of the food may improve. Nonetheless, still enjoyed the meal there :
3
The variety are very little, quite disappointing! If there is no credit card promotion 1 for 1, not worth paying.
4
We were seated near the teppanyki area despite being the 2nd group of guest to enter the restaurant after it opens at 630pm. Repeated requests to change the seats were not met. Had to endure the teppanyki smoke which spoils the dining experience.
4
The ambience was great. Service was attentive and the spread of food was good. Throw in a little shopping before and after the meal and the experience was a wonderful one
4
The cake is nice but ice cream doesn't taste good at all. Other food is average. Wanted to try out the prata but nobody was there to serve
4
It was our 1st visit to triple three, we were very impressed with the food quality. It was so delicious. As good as a 'fine dining' standard. As we tried a lot other buffets around Singapore. Definitely worth the money and will go back again.
4
Had a great time celebrating Father's Day. Food was fine and my daughter enjoyed the kid's corner where they have face and hand painting and puppet making
1
Is such a lousy dinner ..the yabby sooooooooooo salty. .fresh seafood???I don't think so..stew beef..ate the radish n spit out immediately cos is sooÃ²o saltyyyyy..so thought of take the soba but was also sooooooooooo saltyyyyy. ..The chef from the roast beef/fish section is the worst..instead of cutting the fish nicely in small portion, he just any how cut n dump on our plate .Only 2 chef are quite friendly. .but the rest never have a single smile even we said thank you. ..The worst buffet dinner I tried. .Paying such high price but terrible bad experience. ..Not worth anything at all. 
5
This isn't our first time dining at this establishment. But my experience at my most recent visit compelled me to write this review. We were a table of 8 adults and 3 toddlers/babies. A boisterous party to say the least. Lets talk about the food first. The beef was definitely the star of the show. Prepared fresh by the dedicated chef- everyone queues up just to get their hands on the beef. In fact, there is no dish there that is not delectable. The sashimi is fresh, the pasta station serves the finest selections, the prata/satay always a class above what you find at other local restaurants. In short, anyone who dines there can be assured of the finest quality.What made our experience all the more complete was the fine service provided by one of the managers Jia Pin. Whilst we were finding a nursing room for our 4 month old baby, not only was he friendly and accomodating, but he also brought us all the way there- to the lift, down one floor and all the way to the door of the nursing room. It's this sort of service that compels one to repatronize the place again. Commendable. 5 stars. Will visit again. Price is on the high side but you have to pay for high quality food/servic

I have been to Triple three buffet a couple of times, usually on a 1-1 deal to get my money's worth. I got this deal for my birthday and thought the DBS promotion was for both lunch and dinner. We are a family of 4 and price for dinner was $88 per person before tax and gst. I already expected around $200+ for my bill for 4 pax. But paid $310+ because the promo was $88 for 1st adult, 2nd adult dines for 50%!Oh I got confused! So people please read the promo first before making a reservation.If I only knew that this is not a 1-1 deal, I should have opted for other hotels which is having other promoton.Food is great but having this buffet with a promotion could have been greater.The dessert spread was limited compared to past visits
5
The variety served here is so wide that I could eat a different 'theme' for 3 consecutive days. A must-try. Always busy
4
Chose triple three because of one for one promotion with a credit card. Was definitely value for money. All was good except coffee was from coffee machine
5
Sumptuous buffet spread. The prawns and sashimi were so fresh. Service staff are friendly and prompt.
4
The atmosphere and environment is causal and relaxing. Selection is relatively wide and most importantly, the food is delectable and well displayed. Great place for get-together
5
Good place for lunch. Slightly pricy but alright with the one-for-one promotion under dbs. Good variet
4
Good variety of food spread. Love their beef, sashimi and lobster! Worth every penny. Great place to hang out with family and friends
5
Together with a group of friends, we decided to have our lunch gathering at Triple Three at Mandarin Orchard Hotel. Wow, it turned out to be such a sumptuous meal. The spread of food was extensive and they were all extremely good quality. From the Ribeye, to Indian cuisine, Japanese and all international selection of food...appetizers to dessert, just too good to describe. Service staff were smiley and always pleasant clearing the mountains of empty plates from our table.  Will definitely go back soon, only thing holding me back is the worry of overeating again

Went for weekday buffet lunch & disappointed that the cooked food spread was very limited. Teppanyaki station : without chicken & pan fried beef seems still raw. Tempura station : the chef cooked tempura in rotation: few green pepper, few mushrooms, few carrots, 10 prawns each time ( prawns limited by management?) I went for 2 rounds but still couldn't get any prawns though the restaurant was filled with 1/3 guests only so needed to wait at the station & finally got 5 prawns & shared with my daughter. The chef skill is commendable as the tempura frying time just right. Chinese food station : I pity the chef has to cook the sweet & sour chicken & fried rice individually ( 1 by 1) based on guests order. It's very much time consuming. Suggested he cook the food beforehand & place it in trays, served with warmers. If more cooked food with warmers can be served, it will sure to attract more customers. The fried rice has no 'wok hei' though he fried it with 'strong ' fire & the chicken will taste better without sauce. Desserts station: the kuehs & cakes considered good but the ice-cream texture was too soft. It melted quickly though the taste was nice. The garlic bread tasted good but quite hard to bite. The service staff is ok. I will not patronize the restaurant again even with 1 for 1 promotion as the Chinese cooked food was very very limited
3
Service was good and the cold seafood are very good but at 108++, the variety is rather lacking.unlikely to go again

I am currently staying at Mandarin Orchard Hotel. The hotel serve breakfast here. After a day, I am so bored to eat here. Of cause it is buffet but actually you don't have so much choices. I hate food here. I don't like their taste. Staffs have bad faces
3
The buffet spread is quite fascinating and plenty of varieties. Services are good too and staff are very efficient.The food taste is rather salty especially the teppanyaki section. Coffee and tea selection are offered via dispensing machine. In my opinion, not up to international buffet standard.

Hi once again, I'm doing a review about this restaurant . So before that here's some information about it . Located in Mandarin Orchard Level 5 ,Triple Three is a Japanese Inspired Extensive International buffet . So before you go there do make reservations cos it's fully booked most of the time or you can try your luck . It's my first time going there I didn't know about making reservations too but thank God my girlfriend and I manage to get a table there . The service is Excellent, very friendly and very efficient. The food one of the best Buffet I have even eaten thus me giving 5 out of 5 In this review. The food there are to delicious it's so nice that I stuff them down and kept eating . Do try the cakes , fresh seafood (sashimiii,oyster,crab),Live Teppanyaki , baked honey Ham and also Foie Gras Frenzy which I highly recommend !!The cost is expensive but it's totally worth the money. Great place to dine whether it's for family dinner , friends , business or party !! Do check them out theres promotions so do check on their website before heading down for the best of yur experience !!! :) Hope u have the most pleasant buffet experienced like I did.

Good service as we were immediately offered a table closer the buffet spread (upon request) as my mother was not able to walk well. However, none if the staff wish the mums on the table even though it was a Mother's day weekend!!Poor in value as at $118++ per pax, the coffee/tea selection was a Nescafe self-service machine! Butter at the bread station was 'anchor'. As for the food quality, it's acceptable. However, there are better choice around town for the same price tag!

Went for their wagyu theme buffet dinner on wed. This visit was really good. I went a couple of time b4, but this recent visit tops them all with the delicious wagyu sashimi! The beef centric theme is also more focused this time, with additional beef items like wagyu sushi, wagyu sashimi, wagyu shabu shabu, wagyu teppanyaki n even herbal beef soup at the chinese live stn. The roasted wagyu, which is good on previous visits, is even better this time. Kudos to 333's wagyu nite. Really enjoyed the food. Hope you can continue serving the wagyu sashimi
4
The food quality was excellent but we expected more on choices. The spread could be improved. I bought Chope vouchers but unfortunately I couldn't use them in order to enjoy the 2nd person for 50% off. So now i ended up with $180 vouchers which i need to spend at the hotel dining outlets :-
4
Great spread of cuisine, includes seafood (oysters, crab legs, etc), western (steak, ham, etc), Indian (prata, tandoori chicken, etc), Japanese (salmon sashimi, sushi, tempura, etc) and so on!Only hot beverage (milk, coffee) from dispensers were included in the buffet package. Got to top up for alcohol and other drinks.There were the Mentaiko Lobsters, only available on Saturday Dinner, gotta try it! (Oh, it's slightly spicy, nice!)Excellent service by the staff too
4
Service was excellent. Staff are helpful and attentive. Plates were clean very fast and my cup was always filled. Range of food was limited buy nice
5
Came here for an early Happy Mother's Day Celebration and to celebrate my daughter's birthday. Wide selection of international food. There are many stations whereby dishes are cooked on demand. Staff are very attentive and our plates are cleared quickly. Special thanks to staff personnel Sara, Quazelle, Kok Leng for their excellent service to make this a memorable event.
3
Atmosphere and service are good. The spread wasn't fantastic. Disappointed for the price paid. Dessert was a huge disappointment. Coffee from the coffee machine is dilute, not sure if they didn't 'top up' the machine or the setting is as such. Took coffee from both machines, both were dilute with no coffee aroma. For such a branded hotel, they don't have assorted tea bag. Just a dispenser with English Breakfast tea. Even with the 1 for 1 promotion, it's still not worth the price paid
5
This is our favorite buffet in SG by far.We usually take advantage of the 1-1 promotion with DBS cards when we dine at Triple Three.The variety of the food is good and the taste is amazing. We have been there at least 4 or 5 times and we still look forward to it every time
5
Service was great! Very attentive staff! Fantastic wide selection of food and taste was fabulous. Presentation of food was impressive too :) Had a very enjoyable brunch with mum, aunties and cousins. Looking forward to the next visit :
4
Food were fresh and delicious. We got the DBS buy 1 get 1 free discount so it was value for money, but with the original price would be a bit expensive.
4
Had staff dinner and dance over at Triple Three. Everything was awesome from start till end. Couldnt get any better without the assistance of my committee. And triple three staff are friendly,attentive. Filled up with smile. Nice ambience,relax,great music
4
Here for buffet lunch for my mum's birthday and am impressed with their service in serving my mum a surprise slice of cake with the crew singing a birthday song for her. In terms of food variety, i would say it's not bad with the seafood, western, japanese, indian cuisine etc.
3
Came to celebrate a special occasion but was disappointed by the spread compared to other hotels. Oysters were plentiful but very small, shellfish were limited and dessert selection was stale and unimpressive. Their wagyu beef and freshly cut sashimi was great though. Service from staff was impeccable though but we most likely won't be back
3
Years ago, this was certainly one of the best buffet in town. Not that it's no longer good, but the food is more or less the same as what you would have tried years ago. There is no reinvention or new creation that excites. Many newer food establishments have caught up and some have even exceeded Triple Three in terms of value-for-money and variety. Some of the newer buffet restaurants have even more refinement in tastes and quality.Haven't been to Triple Three for a while and decided to drop by last evening and yes, the food variety was predictably the same worse still, if you happen to be seated near the live teppanyaki section, your clothes and hair will smell like a barbeque after the meal. The smoke exhaust system is either faulty or not well maintained and serviced!Spread was still pretty appetising but if you have better venue elsewhere, come here only as a last resort
3
wide variety of different cuisine, ambiance of the place and service of the staff is very good, my favourite corner is the salad bargood place to celebrate special occassio
4
Excellent food. Good spread , Free beer on that day. Service was excellent. Will return for sure to try the other buffet themes
4
Great atmosphere upon entering. Great variety of quality foods you would find at this buffet. Seafood was pretty fresh. Tried the oysters, crab pincers and shell, prawns. Followed by flame grilled wagyu sushi, its a must try! Melts in your mouth. Sashimi was pretty fresh(salmon belly, tuna) For cooked pasta, Sakura Ebi pesto is a great choice. The teppanyaki tasted great and nice as well. Worth a try. Meat goers can go for larger cuts of wagyu beef cut by the chef. There's also pan grilled wagyu offered. Cheese fondue is worth a mention here. Dip it with some potatoes or ham to go with. Dim sum choices were limited to a few. The steamed beef sucks honestly. For deserts, there was a great variety to choose from. Sad part is there's not much macarons. But the ice cream machine was a plus point with many flavours and tasted addictive. To finish, service of the restaurant was superb. One of the best places I have experienced so far
3
Spread is good but some details are not considered. A instant coffee machine you find in a community center or neighborhood cafe is not a good idea to used, crab legs are slit with a good intentions of easy eating but instead of a simple slit across, it's cut a diamond shape hole which makes it very difficult to dig out the flesh. Teppanyaki bean sprout raw. Tea not served with tea bag was too diluted, ask for tea bag for my second cup. The rest of the items are good just as others around the same budget
4
Tried almost all the food, Quite a good range of food choices. Dim sum choices were too few, teppanyaki was gd
4
The spread was quite okay with cold seafood, indian, western, cold cuts, cheese platters, dessert counter, japanese( teppanyaki, tempura, sushi/sashimi), local. Only drinks available are plain water and standard coffee machine beverages. You have to pay for juices at $10/glass. The attractive part was mainly the cold seafood but other than that the other food wasn't fantastic. The popsicles were great though and of course, can't go wrong with fresh fruits. Service staff were really polite and offered a birthday song as well as a slice of cake. Though did not fantastic, effort was there
4
Good range n great service for the 1-for-1 promo! Service from staffs and quality of food are not compromised because of promotion!
5
Its international spread of cooked and fresh are absolutely well done. Especially it's cooked food, which I enjoyed so much that I forgotten my typical love of fresh seafood and sashimi which I normally fill my belly. From its northern Indian food, Western carvings, salad and pasta to Japanese cold dishes, teppanyaki, tempura and okayaki. The staff is ever alert to clear your dishes on the dot and even helping out with my pregnant wife balancing two plates in hand. Two thumbs up
4
Buffet spread was alright especially for lunch time. However they have some very nice open kitchen dishes like the pasta, laska and craving station. Service was ok but can improve on especially the refill of ice water
4
Staff were efficient in answering any enquires and had extensive product knowledge. could have included more varieties for main course
3
Food range is dissapointing food wasn't tasty but the service was good not value for money. Food not very fresh dessert was awful . Will never visit agai
5
The setting is cosy and pleasant, and the buffet spread is focused and has a good variety without being overwhelming. The beef/shrimp teppanyaki, freshly shucked oysters, sashimi and cold seafood spread are great! My family and I love going there if we want to go for a buffet spread. It can be pricey if there is no credit card promotion (2nd diner 50% off or 1-for-1)
5
Came here for my friend's birthday in 2016. Triple three offers wide spread of food ranging from seafood to indian food. It is definitely a great and comfortable ambience to catch up with your friends/colleagues. Service staff was excellent. Will be coming back
2
We luv seafood so was very excited about trying this buffet.The grilled scallops looked so yum but were actually tasteless. Even the oysters and cold crabs were super salty. Salmon sashimi was acceptable. Only nice prawns was from the teppan counter.
5
Recently, I brought my Mother-in-law and my family to Triple Three in Mandarin Orchard Hotel. I am impressed by the level of service rendered by its staff. My Mother-in-law is almost blind and needed assistance. The staff were very helpful and kind to to meet various needs of her, though they do not need to help her. I am impressed by their kind actions that go beyond my expectations.I had a very meaningful time with my family over meal. Thank you to the Triple Three staff
4
I would say that the buffet spread is rather extensive with Japanese , Indian, Continental and local food. Dessert items consists of all manner of cakes and even ice cream. Nice ambience rounds off the dining experience
4
Variety of food is good and the quality is better than the rest of buffet restaurant tried previously. It is a different experience from the usual buffet restaurant as there are a lot of live cook stations
5
The service is excellent with very attentive and friendly staff. The buffet spread is fresh and tasty. Booking service is also very easy
2
Its my wedding anniversary and we decided to pay a visit. The staff are prompt in clearing the tables and topping up of water. Food wise is alright too. The only disappointing part is the seating arrangement. It is really very lousy ! The tables are arranged side by side leaving a small space for walking. Meaning the next table is actually quite near to our table, privacy is almost to none, no place for bags . My Hubs and I are big size. It is very inconvenient to walk from our table out to the food counters, as sadly there are many chairs and tables we need to pass thru and we do get unnecessary stares from other diners as if we are purposely passing thru their lanes. thou it seems more like a diner's issue, not the restaurant, however if the tables and chairs were not arranged in such an inconsiderate manner, I guess diners like us wont have to go thru such treatment. We are the same paying guest as other diners (and dont tell me that the place is only meant for ppl with small build to visit ! This is really very ridiculous !! ), we purely wanted to have an enjoyable lunch. This is a memorable visit, an unfortunate one. We think twice before making another booking or recommending to my family and friends
5
I am not a fan of the buffet as it involves 1. too much eating 2 sampling poor quality food. But Triple 3 provided a good spread and deserves to be acknowledged.I enjoyed the angus beef. Tender and moist and cut to order. Service was very good too. Staff taking time to show concern for my elderly parents. And to top a good meal, they even offer a decent cup of teh tarik (local sweet tea)
5
Had my family gathering there. Food was amazing but choices abit limited. Staffs was friendly and prompt in clearing the used plate
4
Buffet spread is good. The popular counters are sashimi (salmon, tuna and yellowtail/ snapper), cold seafood (Alaska crab, fresh oyster, mussels), grilled meat ( waygu beef and ham), tempura ( deep fried oyster and octopus) and teppanyaki ( salmon and some other fish). Indian counter serving briyani, curry, noodle counter serving ramen and udon not not so popular. Overall the food are nice, the best I would say is the memorable are the fried oyster and octopus. They also have sake tasting counter, I tried plum wine, which is very nice. Dessert counters are one of the most forgettable. The green tea cheesecake taste good but does not taste like cheesecake at all... more like normal sponge cake. Tiramisu is the best of all, but it is not traditional Italian tiramisu but nice fusion tiramisu with green colour topping and coconut after taste. I did not try the icecream this time but my friends did it. They are nice and my friends did it many rounds. Service wise, they clear our plates and top up the water promptly. We reached early, and waited outside for 10-15 min, once we were seated, we were asked whether we want beer, which is not included in the buffet. Instead of service water immediately, they only do so when we go to water counter. Not a very pleasant experience. Overall is nice dining experience. But with the price paid, I would expect a little more.
4
The grilled lobster with mentaiko cheese and teppanyaki shrimp/beef were fantastic! They had Popsicles of green tea and assorted fruits sorbets last time but today we only had 3 ordinary flavours of ice-cream, which was ok. The cakes were not that great. The roast was tender and juicy. The grilled scallop was a little undercooked and had too much salt. My favourite was still the Alaskan King Crab but they had very limited portion of it. Oysters were fresh and succulent. Thankfully we enjoyed the one for one promotion using DBS or UOB cards. They gave us a complimentary cake for our birthday girl, which was a nice gesture.
4
Brought my family here to celebrate my wife birthday. The spread was ok, some of the more popular food items are not refilled quick enough, possibly due to the crowd. But with patience to wait, there is no worries that it will not be refilled. Queues are initially long for the popular food items; towards 9pm, most already had their fill and queues stop forming. Mentaiko lobster is nice; the cold cut/smoked meats is great, the cheese selection is fantastic for a cheese lover. Sashimi is fresh, wasabi is missing the oomph factor that comes with good fresh wasabi. The roast has lots of room to improve, truffle sauce has absolutely no hint of truffle taste - it taste more like a normal brown sauce. The Japanese soft boiled egg's seasoning was inconsistent although they are generally tasty.On the service, there are definitely room for improvement. We were not offered a drink menu, or asked if we are interested to purchase any drinks; we were however asked if we want warm or cold water. We asked for 1 warm 3 cold. That was the first glass - thereafter we refill our own with the room temperature water at our table... No more ice or warm water. Although sake tasting was available, it was not made known. We only chance upon it after walking by someone else who was asking for it at the sake corner. Despite making on the reservation that it is a birthday celebration, It would be a nice gesture if the restaurant would have arrange a slice off cake from the buffet desert counter with a candle on it as a surprise... Other 5 stars hotel restaurant would have done it, perhaps our expectation is set too high for this restaurant's service.In summary, food is great, we enjoyed our meal. One star is removed for the service that can be improved on. It doesn't have the service level 5 star hotel
5
Team Luch with office mates. The Spread is very extensive. The seafood counter is not to be missed. With a wide range of international cuisine, the buffet lunch was a great culinary experience. The place is very cozy and does not feel crowded in spite of large lunch crowd The staff is courteous and professional
3
Quality of food was okay. Experience could have been better if items were regularly replenished. Some items (e.g. King crab, cherries) ran out early and were not automatically replenished until requests were made with the staff. For the price charged, one would expect more
3
My first visit to Triple celebrate my son's 21st birthday. The food overall was good especially the lobster & beef which really impress. Good service staff who promptly assist and help when needed. My biggest puzzle was only why soft drinks/fruit juice are not inclusive...i can understand beer/wine is chargeable but soft drinks/fruit juice? My first buffet experience in sg without soft drinks/fruit juice
4
Went for dinner on a Fri night. The food is generally fresh and nice. Enjoyed the sashimi, and seafood on ice. Especially liked the teppanyaki stn although the teppanyaki prawns tasted a bit too springy (coz of processing using baking soda)? The lobster mentaiko is really nice, although some pieces are a bit over cooked. Service is prompt n friendly as usual. Staff took too long to replenish the cherries. Overall a nice dinner
4
This was my first visit to Triple III buffet. I was given a window table as requested and the service staff were very professional. Really enjoyed all of the food. The ham really is a good as they say. The Teppanyaki food station was great. Fresh and hot with very tender beef and stir fried sprouts. The lobsters came out a little later but no problem getting an extra portion and the these we basted with a spice flamed mayo which really tasted good. The oysters they were serving this evening were a bit on the small side. Overall a good meal. Will certainly return when next in Singapore
2
Had my dinner on 30/Dec/2106 with my friends and to my surprise is totally a disappointment to me and my friends, I felt more disappointed because I'm the one that recommend my friends to come this place for our annual class gathering. I wanted to come here again is because I enjoyed my lunch when I visited last month with my family, we enjoyed it so much, that I have decided to hold my annual class gathering here, but in the end it makes my day so bad that I keep thinking that I have made a wrong choice and I felt so bad that my friends did not enjoy the food at all. Me too, did not enjoy the food at all. The food is cold for some dishes like, scallops, fish, mutton curry, stir fried vegetable & shiitake mushroom and etc. Totally disappointed! The amount of money spend is not worth it at all
4
The 1 for 1 is really worth the money. The ice cream was the best and the honey ham. The only bad point is the mango ice cream was out of stock so fast. The sauce for the beef was not tat nice. But overall the food is delicious
5
The selection of food was good. The seafood was fresh and the desserts were looking very tempting! The best was the beef, tender and juicy!
5
We had a department get together for 9 of us. Food was great and this reasonable price. The Sashimi was fresh and the variety is good. Just have to eat a little of everything will made us really full. Dessert spread yummy!!!! I will visit again.
4
Food - overall great! The beef teppanyaki was delicious and the quality of meat is top-notch. I think it was wagyu. Seafood option is not too great, if i compare it to let say Carousel which was a wide selection of seafood options. They had crab, shrimp and oyster and i forgot the other one. Unfortunately the lobster is only available during weekends (at a higher price!). Desert not so much options.Service - overall great. They know what they are doing here.Value - tad expensive i believe. I can get a buffet with seafood for a lower price like Carousel
3
For a Christmas feast, we expect something much better than that. We are celebrating together on a special day! Many items were missing as compared to last 3 year and find it not a great memorable one.
3
I am thankful for the service captain who consented to my impromptu request. The Christmas range of dishes was wide and quality good. We had an enjoyable family meal. Thank you.
5
If you want to have a buffet at Triple 3, you must go on the weekend dinners as they only serve the amazing baked lobsters then! Somehow the chef who does them seems a bit unhappy with guests asking for one too many lobsters, but hey, isn't this supposed to be a buffet?
4
Good and attentive service given. Much better qua;ity food compared to previous year. i will go back there again. 1 for 1 deal especially welcomed for all with families
4
The only drawback is you can't take the amount yourself. But the food choices are great. Love the Wagyu beef!
4
Overall food was good and fresh but variety could be better. Service wise was great from reservation to dining. I notice that seats nearer to the buffet line is very stuffy and smell oily. Luckily we got seats nearer to the bar. Not sure if its Christmas season, cook food section is rather low on variety too
5
My hubby and myself was very pleased with the buffet..lots of variety and food are fresh, especially the seafood..will be back defintely
2
The cold seafood was not fresh. The crab meat was dry. Prawn shell was all stick on to the flesh. Variety and selection are limited. Is not worth the price even with 1 for 1 discount. We paid almost $70 for lunch and getting such standard. Even other restaurant that charge 40+ has got better seafood than them. Teppanyaki was pre cooked and left cold on the shelf. Some dish were empty and not refilled. The korean beef has got a rubbery texture. Pasta choice out of 4, 3 of them are tomato base. No cream base at all. The only good was the torched cheese lobster. Which is always running out.As for the service, we have to prompt the waiter to clear the table with stacked plates and bowls for a few times. Not very initiative. When they approaches us, they mumble and we cant really hear nor understand them.Overall is quite unpleasant and disappointing as we booked a table of 12 to celebrate our friends' birthday
4
Triple Three was doing a special themed buffet with fresh produce from Hokkaido. The buffet spread was very good and there was lots of fresh seafood airflown from Hokkaido. Most of the cooked food was made to order and well executed. There was a nice personal touch from the restaurant when they came around to distribute Hokkaido milk soft serve to every table and to do an on-the-spot lucky draw with a gift from Hokkaido for each table. My only gripe would be that the desserts could be of better quality and more in line with the buffet theme
5
Food is really good. Seafood is very fresh. Love the teppanyaki station. Service is very good, staffs are very attentiv
1
Sashimi not fresh. And waiting for the payment was merchant system down. I was waiting ,and they give the information not clear
5
The Chope Booking system was brilliant, and it was easy and the communication between the restaurant and chope was awesome as they seems almost instant.
2
1. Cold Seafood isn’t that fresh – One serving that’s what I took2. Limited selections of Sashimi3. Korean beef hard like rubber – Pre-cooked4. $40 pax is more reasonable Low Priority for future dining consideration
4
Weekday 1-1 lunch buffet with posb card. Decent spread of food. Good service and pleasant staff. Dessert spread limited though there were a few good ones.
4
Triple Three restaurant has a wide spread of food for the Saturday dinner buffet and most of the dishes were prepared in small portions so as to maintain their freshness. I also like the cakes and pastries in the dessert counter. However unfortunately, the better chocolate cakes are not replenished after the first round. Also the vent hood at the open kitchen needed improvement so as to keep the air free of odour in the restaurant.
4
Went there on a Saturday to attend my friend's gal's 1 yr old birthday party, so we were in a private room. It's far away from the buffet spread, but the service of the staff was impeccable. When the staff saw me peeling prawns, she put a small bowl of water with a slice of lemon in it on the table for washing hands. Frankly speaking, I was quite impressed as not many hotels bothered to do that. However, I am not sure if you are sitting in the general dining area, will they be as attentive? The spread is quite good. For the cold seafood, they have prawns, mussels, clams and baby lobsters. There's a pasta station, laksa station, teppanyaki station and tempura station(which is always full). Needed to wait for a fresh batch of the tempura prawns everytime as they run out real fast. The roast that day was honey glazed ham and roast beef. For drinks, they have juices, iced tea, hot tea and the coffee machine with mocha, teh tarik etc. Desserts are quite disappointing though. Not much selection, and no chocolate type at all, not even chocolate ice cream. And oh, the hot drinks machine has no hot chocolate also.Would recommend for the 1-for-1 promotion, otherwise is a tad pricey
3
My family and I booked a table for 9 about a week or so back in celebration of my birthday and my parent's wedding anniversary. The restaurant staff that served us at the reception showed us to our seats with a cold face. We were allocated a sofa seat split 6 and 4, which allowed for my young son space to roam about. This was not my first time at the restaurant albeit it being some years since I last came. The restaurant still maintains a delectable spread of food and the quality of it. Yet, I was appalled at the end of the meal when I was approached for the bill. The staff had just presented me with a birthday cake and while in the midst of having the cake, one of them had approached me to "settle the bill". I think this was just bad manners of the staff to literally shove the menu to the customers and expecting them to present to settle the bill immediately. I have been to other buffets where the wait staff would politely ask to whom the bill should be presented to and then ask if they could get the bill settled. Would have expected this if it was your typical restaurant but this is coming from a 5-star hotel that boasts and also prides itself in quality service delivery.Really poor customer service and bad hospitality
5
DBS/posb/UOB credit card disc 1 for 1 lunch buffet.. good quality foodGood service with wide spread of food from jap, western, Indian, Italian and Chinese.
3
Poor selection and variety, after the 1st round we have trouble looking for other things to eat. Desserts are mediocre too. The saving grace was the choc and mango popsicle.
3
I celebrated my baby boy's 1st birthday here on 26 Nov, Sat. The buffet spread may be limited in range but generally the food was good. My guests enjoyed the lunch as well as spacious yet private area that the restaurant had allocated for us. Ambience was also warm and nice with Xmas theme decorations and background music. However, I wasn't too happy that the waitress kept coming over to ask me to settle the bill at 2pm when we were in the midst of arranging the birthday cake celebration. I probably should have told her to come by afterwards but I was also too flustered at that point to think of that. None of the staff had the initiative to ask if we needed any help (of course we did, there was over 20 guests!), like passing us small plates for the cake slices. Though the staff were generally friendly and quick to remove the used plates, I really felt put off by the staff's lack of thought and tact. My baby chair also took a long time to reach us, and getting a box for the leftover cake took alot of asking
4
The quality of food was fairly high. However the speed of the food preparation could have been improved. The tempura prawns were never available as other patrons would have snapped them up fairly quickly. The waitresses were quite attentive and were quick to refill water and clear the dishes. Overall a pleasant experience.
4
I have patronised this restaurant for a couple of times.Triple Three was ranked as one of the best international hotel buffet in sg.It was named after the address of the hotel (Mandarin Orchard)Their seafood on ice are fresh. Quality of food is commendable as well. Nice ambience. Suitable for business, as well as gatherings. Service crews are polite and quick to react. Made my dining experience a pleasant one.They have different theme (e.g. Lobster theme; Hokkaido Seafood theme, etc) and they often have credit card promotion (especially for lunch). May check out with the receptionist when you call to make a reservation.They are usually packed with reservations for lunch and weekend dinners. Do call in advance to reserve.The only con is the customer service at the Front Desk and the receptionist who answer the telephone calls. Not as friendly and service oriented compared to the service crews.When I tried calling them to confirm my reservation timing, they picked up the calls and hang up without saying anything. Note that this didn't happened just once. I had to call the hotel receptionist and get the restaurant to call me

Thank you Jenny for making our anniversary special. Thank you to the triple three team of cook and staffs to arranged for us to have our same window seat we had the previous time we were there and also specially arranged to have Yen and Jenny sent us a cake with a candle for our 1 year anniversary.Total surprised us for the extra mile to made our day.Also prepared a lobster for us to eat which is tasty and compliment to the chef who cooked it.Enjoyed the wide range of food at the buffet too. the cold spread, tasty tuna / salmon /swordfish fresh sashimi, the fried food, the tempura prawn /vegetable, the indian curry and naan are great. amazed by the wide variety of cheese available.The coffee machine was a plus too for a perk after meal with cakes and fruits.the fruit juice were a little sweet thou, will be nice to have some ice to put, but is ok since we add some cold water.the chinese lor mee and laksa was average, maybe due to ate better one and compared it.the oyster was fresh too and tasty.I like the baked salmon and ham as well.the ice cream was one of the reason we went too, enjoyable stick of the pink, coconut, chocolate, green tea.Thank you Jenny once again who served us well and take care of us and clear our plate. hard work on you and thank Triple three team for the arrangement
4
wide range of food serve hot & fresh. its located inside of a five star hotel called Mandarin Orchard hotel. Its a round the clock coffee shop but they serve breakfast from 6:30 to 10am
5
Food was excellent selection was more than adequate, from Western tastes to eastern delighted the taste buds
4
Environment: Great for hosting large tables for gathering or even as a couple. Modern feel to their decorations and furniture.Food: Cook to perfection with many onsite chefs doing things like tempanyaki and noodles for you. Food is constantly being replenished. One of the better ones are the tempura which is bound to have Long queue whenever it is replenish as the outer is simple so crisp and fragrant with fresh prawns. Service: Good mannered table staff who helped us to get our tea and coffee happily and even helped us take a picture.

Had lunch with my family on a saturday using the dbs 1 for 1 promo. We had a wonderful time. The food was great. And the waiters are really nice
3
There was not much variety and the food taste was average. The variety of food were of rather low value including fish ball noodle soup and roti prata. So it definitely didn't felt like it was worth the price.
4
Went for the Hokkaido Harvest Buffet dinner. Food was good but a little too much seafood goodness.Service was excellent with the servers constantly helping to top up water and offering the beers. Plates were periodically cleared and the kids were looked after very promptly and without biaseness.The sashimi cuts were, unfortunately off standard, feeling more like sushi slices with the thickness very thin. The portions were also very little, despite being a buffet, with mekajiki slices only having two thin slices and even after mentioning for more, it was barely 5 slices. Prices are a little pricey and would probably not be there if not for the POSB card promo

Went for the Hokkaido Buffet with DBS/POSB card promo (50% off second pax). It was expensive but totally worth it! Wagyu beef was melt-in-your mouth... Enjoyed the other food as well (e.g oysters, desserts, etc) Delicious! Service was very attentive. Plates changed promptly. Will come back for more..
4
The special Hokkaido seafood themed food was great. The sashimi was fresh, Wagyu beef was wonderful, lots of seafood and Japanese dishes. If the price could be lower..
3
The restaurant was looking worn-out and tired. Ambience was close to that of a food court, noisy and lit with glaring lights. I must say, however, service, food choice and quality was above average and dishes were replenished promptly. Overall, I will recommend this if all you wish to indulge in is sashimi. I feel that there are more exclusive restaurants one can splurge on.
4
Nice place to have breakfast but it is usually very busy. The staff seems to fit people into smaller tables than they should but it was overall an average dining experience
3
Service and ambient are above average. Not much varieties of food, especially seafood counter. And not satisfy with the freshness of prawn
4
Food served as usual. Was hoping for a new ingredients there. Hopefully the chef will introduced for a new food menus next time visiting
4
This is my 3rd visit and I was expecting same or a little better experience. On the overall, food variety has reduced a few kinds as compared to last year's and 2012's visits. An example would be the chinese doubled boiled soup that used to be available. Credits can be given for its service as the staffs are as polite as ever. They even give away small gifts as an appreciation for our patronage that day.

I visited with my friends on 23 Oct 16 for Sunday brunch. A wide range of items. Service of staff could be better, especially the staff at the teppanyaki counter. Ordered some vegetables and the staff appeared reluctant to do it. When told to do so, fried a big plate of vegetables that could serve more than 4 persons, staff training should be enhanced.As for sashimi counter, ran out of salmon belly within an hour... I thought it is buffet.. ha ha. Word of advise - ordered more right from the start or prepared to not get what you want ....Ricky EuLife n style member

Amazing oysters we had the last time we went out as a group of office colleagues. Mandarin hotel on Orchard Rd has this gem with amazing sea food spread and various cuts of beef and pork. Super enjoyable
5
Good food and wide variety! There's also a good selection of beverages for diners to choose from. A good place to dine, especially with credit card promotion of 1 for 1
5
I had made reservations for 4 on 19 Oct. 2016 for a gathering of old friends.Imagine my pleasant surprise when we reached there and found that it was the first day of the Hokkaido Harvest Fare!There was the Kagami Biraki (Sake Opening) and the Tuna Cutting of a Blue Fin Tuna.Food is fresh with a very wide range - all equally fresh. Quality is 9 out of 10.What amazes me was the Otoro (tuna belly), freshly carved from the Bluefin Tuna. It just melts on your tongue!The lobster was good, the mini Hokkaido Donburis with a poached eggs, the Uni on poached egg, the steamed Wagyu, freshest oysters and seafood you can find in Singapore, Hokkaido Desserts and ice creams, nice tempura, nice ham and roast beef and the list goes on.Service? Impeccable! There was a welcome drink for everyone and free sake to savour.In summary, I was totally bowled over!!!Highly recommended!

my first experience at "buffet restaurant" in Singapore, celebrating a social lunh with a large group of collegueasIt is an high quality all you can eat, with a large choice of dishes (from starter to dessert) from different cuisine styles.Nice ambient. Friendly staff. Price reflects the excellent food and service
3
With the kind of food selections and the price they charge, we think we won't becoming back until new improvement can be seenThe sashimi station serving and selections is the worst we have seen, not very freshort and 2 types onlySeafood station also great disappointment With the charges, we can easily find a better deal in the same orchard are
1
Far too crowded, to many tables and chairs, too close together. Food quality and service were below average
5
Nice ambiance and good variety of food selection, service from the friendly staff was attentive yet unobtrusive. Fresh seafood was very good (oysters, sashimi, lobsters and crab legs etc......) Meat section has a wide range, from beef teppanyaki, roast beef, honey baked ham and etc. Laksa from asian section could have been better though (needs to be more lemak). Dessert section was excellent. Overall would definitely come back again
3
Buffet spread was minimal but of quality. Table was spaced a little too close for comfort, especially near enough to hear the conversation of the couple next door. Enjoyed mainly the roast beef, teppanyaki, baked ham, sashimi and seafood spread. Hot beverage could have included brewed coffee beans and tea bags instead of dispenser mix. But the iced earl grey tea was great! Another feedback is that plates and cups need not be cleared so often as I wanted to re-use them to save the earth (less washing means less water wastage too!). Oh yes, how could I forget the unique ice popsicles that ended our meal, as the dessert spread was none too fantastic. and our cake experience was marred by a fellow diner who had ignorantly picked off the mini macarons that decorated the hazelnut chocolate cake (if I remember correctly). Overall, was a satisfactory meal. Thank you
3
It has a nice ambience and good to have group of friends gathering.What is lacks of is varieties, lack of chinese food, dim sum is bad, local food is tasteless.Beverages is worst, no tea bag, every drinks is pre-mix, coffee, cappuccino and latte is from dispenser.. but i do like their salad which is fresh, japanese food is their focus in this buffett.. and i find that the chef behind the teppanyaki is rude... so when you are thinking of experiencing in this so call 5 star hotel cafe.. don't put your expectation too muc
4
Celebrated buddy's birthday here.The food and services were awesome. Friendly staff and waiters/waitresses. Will likely to come back to this restaurant again. Highly Recommended!!
5
Decided to get dinner here, usually it's not common for me to get dinner inside the hotel, but triple3 has changed a lot, the food option was marvelous, lobster, crabs, and other seafood was tremendous such as the wagyu teppanyaki, and the pasta as well. Dessert was nice, with ice cream on a stick as well.Although drink option will need to be considered as well
5
Staff were attentive and professinal. There was a sense of pride in each segment of the buffet and the desserts were great too!! A pleasant dining experience...with the 1-for-1 UOB credit card promotion, it makes it all the more value for money

I am writing in to express my great disappointment with your service at Triple Three, Mandarin Orchard. It had indeed spoiled my high expectations of your restaurant and greatly disappointed that my anniversary’s special was spoiled by the poor attitude of your staff.After hearing much positive reviews about Triple Three, my husband and I decided to swing by for our anniversary dinner on the 1st October. Things went on pretty well, with server helping us with the tables and drinks etc, until we headed to the Grilled Lobster section. There was a queue and my hub had decided to go ahead with the queue while I make my rounds at the Japanese section. Even from the Japanese section, I can hear the cook “slamming” the lobsters on the customers’ plates (the lobsters were kept behind the stand, and upon request, the cook will then put in on your plate) and not to mention his sulky face. Maybe he was pissed at the endless queue at his particular section but hey! we paid almost $130 per pax for this? Are we not entitled for a lobster? Never mind, when it was my hub’s turn, with much noise made in purpose, he placed the lobster on a plate and shove it into my hub’s hands. No words were exchange, no smile was given. Giving benefit of doubt, we reckon he is busy, tired or whatever reason that results in that sort of attitude. I decided to go for the grilled lobster at about 8+pm when there wasn't any queue. I stood there for a good 30 seconds, trying to get their attention with my “hello, excuse me. Can I’ve one please?” *repeat 5 times* There was a group of cooks behind the section, and they were happily having a good conversation, totally disregarding my presence and I am very sure, all of them have actually noticed me, Finally one “kind” soul decided to acknowledge me by replying “Ya?” in an arrogant manner. Still smiling, I told him I would like to have one lobster and that he can just place it on the plate I am using right now, and as usual he “slammed” that poor lobster on my plate, choosing the spot right on top of my salad dressing which I’ve put it at the side of the plate. BRILLANT! No “opps”, No “sorry”, not even an apologetic smile. He just turned, walk away and continue his conversation with his group of cooks.This is really not something I expected out of a hotel dining. Considering we paid $130 per pax for this, we expect some customer service standards. The whole experience was very unprofessional with no care and attention. Extremely disappointing indeed. Upon paying for the bill, we decided to use our X’s credit card to make the payment as there was a 10% discount off the bill however we were told that the promotion doesn't applies to that particular card, strange because we’d call the bank earlier to check on this promotion and we were told otherwise. In the end, my hub had to make a trip down to the carpark to dig for another card. As an overall rating, our experience at your establishment was nowhere near what we had come to expect from Mandarin Orchard. I hope that you will look into this and train your staff properly to have the appropriate behavior befitting the diner’s experiences

I had breakfast here for a week that I was staying at the Mandarin Orchard. The spread on offer is amazing and doesn't get boring, and they are efficient in handling the large number of people eating there.
5
Excellent variety and great service! The lady waiting on us was attentive and helpful. Food was tasteful especially the asian corner. Thank you
4
Love the atmosphere and the spread of food. Seafood was fresh, this was my second visit. Will definitely come again.Do try their home-made ice-cream 
4
Lobster too chewy. Mentaiko paste on lobster too salty. Should have kept lobster at seafood corner or grill/bbq. Not worth the price just bec it's Fri lobster night. Almost $130 per person on Fri for dinner.
4
Food was fresh and variety was decent. The Japanese sashimi is my favorite section. Glad we have it a second go. Definitely better than the last time
3
the freshness of raw seafood need to be improved. variety of food also quite limited. service provided is good, friendly staff and good atmosphere
4
Hotel service, food wise is excellent. only down side is some people are pretty kiasu, like when some specific food is served, 1 guy may just take half or sometimes everything in 1 shot leaving nothing else for others to try..but oh well, its a buffet after all and hotel can't control the actions of the customers.p.s. they have nice lobsters 
3
food quality is reasonable for $88 a head, with the additional discount from CHOPE it makes it worth the dinner, the serving staff were attentive and helpful. However, the counters were closed off and you get served. Some of the stations had very good and knowledgeable sous Chef but others were used as training stations for apprentices. I ordered the oysters which were shucked in front of us, a plus but the staff was dour faced and moved reluctantly. He got his apprentice to start but got nowhere because it wasnt easy, in the end he had to do it himself causing a line to wait for him.
3
We went on a Wednesday night (yesterday) and took advantage of the DBS promotion where the second adult eats at 50% of the price. For the price and the Mandarin brand name much more was expected of the experience. First, the cutlery - there was no porcelain spoon for the Chinese soup and tau suan etc ( you had to use the dessert spoon in your place setting whenever a spoon was called for) , no spoon for coffee/tea but only a wooden stirrer. Secondly, except for the cold seafood and Japanese food , the selection was small - only a few items (3?) for the dim sum, small selection also of dessert and ice cream and hot food. There was no Chinese food - no noodles or roast meat. Thirdly, food quality - was that a piece of popiah that I ate? chicken soup was watery. However, the roast beef and ham were very good as was the teppanyaki. Fourthly, we were disconcerted to have the bill presented to us before we had finished eating. We had not visited Triple 3 for some time but had always looked on it as having the quintessential buffet for other outlets or establishments. Sadly, the reverse is now true
3
The range of food available was limited.No one went for the chinese dim sum section and the indian cuisine.Limited choice of fruits and the dessert selection was pathetic.Dragon fruit is too dry and so was the watermelon.I am quite disappointed at the salmon sashimi served, it did not taste fresh.My wife like the oysters though and i like the stirred fried beef.The black chicken soup was not tasty.If not for the current promotion for 2nd diner at half price, i would give it a poor rating.Will not visit this place again.Fortunately i did not brought my infant to this restaurant as the seating was tight between tables
3
Quality of freshly shucked oysters and seafood is excellent. Very limited selection of all else - pork wan ton noodles, roasts, teppanyaki (awesome beef, but grossly salted prawns) and dessert - that's generally over seasoned and cooked. For S$125 a head on a Saturday night, I expect more.
4
Dined in on a monday. Located right at the same level of check in counters of mandarin orchard hotel. They were having free kirin beer for diners. Used uob card to pay as it was 1 for 1. Ambience was excellent. Wide spread of food available. Fresh oysters, king crab legs, cold prawns, turkey ham, steak cubes, and many more. However, the king crab legs were salty. Rest of food were awesome.Highly recommended for couples and family.
4
We went during a Sunday evening and went for the 2nd diner at 50% promotion. The staff were attentive to our needs and prepared additional serviettes to clean my child's hands. My wife and I were pleased with the quality of food and particularly loved the teppanyaki ribeye section, and the seafood section (sashimi, oysters...) However, the dessert selections could be widened as there were limited pastries to choose from. There were also only one tea selection available, without the luxury of choosing the other tea forms. It will be a more comfortable experience perhaps if the air-conditioning could be adjusted slightly warmer and my wife found it to be a little too chilly and the cooked food tends to turn cold pretty fast.Overall, we were pleased with the food and service as it mostly met our expectations, albeit there are always going to have room for improvements
5
The food was good, service was excellent. The staff were very helpful and every time we went out to take food, our plates were automatically cleared
3
I have made reservations for 10 and the seats were lay on 3 tables where it's usually 2 per pax. And the tables were not even so the person seating in between won't be able to lay his plate evenly or have to squeeze to one side. The table behind was also too close that every time the guest leaves their seats they will knock into our seats. All these thoughtless arrangements were rectified after 20 mins. Although the staff were quick to rectify but given certain expectations of such an establishment, the experience has been disappointing. First impression counts and this would be an F even when the buffet is decent
4
It was a nice experience and the staff was very polite. As my dad didnt like the seat that was assigned to us in the first place. The staff willing to change for us.. for a few times.. and we were grateful for that. Wide variety of food that you can choose for. Recommended
4
Decent place but limited fares for vegetarians. Great desserts & polite staff. Very spacious & yet always nearly full. Try once - recommend the Indian counter with fresh naans & paratha
3
There was no refreshment on the cold crab at abt 1pm where the time of the buffet lunch were still early. The Chef told me they will replenish in 10 mins time but it was rather a disappointment after we waited till 1.45pm. The cold steam crab was one of the attraction to us and it turned out to be otherwise. Rather disappointed with the
5
Went on a business lunch and took advantage of the pay for one diner, the next diner gets to eat free.Lunch spread was good and cold seafood corner seemed ever popular. Japanese fresh cuts and western grill did not fail us.We had several helpings of these and the Indian food corners as well. Desserts were ok.Service was so good we were reminding each other to return soon for another meal soon.For the price you pay for this lunch promotion, we have no complaints. Shall go again for the buffet dinner soon as the dinner spread has even more options.Overall a wonderful meal we had and we all left happy and full
4
Enjoy dining, wide range of selection for seafood. The wagyu beef grilled & served in cubes was yummy.
4
The ambience is good. Great selection of food that we can't finish trying them out in one seating. Staff is very polite and efficient too

We came here for my mum's birthday celebration as UOB had 1 for 1 lunch buffet. We found the seafood spread to be really good with fresh lobsters, prawns, oysters, sashimi :) my family enjoyed the seafood very much and went back to get it again and again. And I was really impressed with the ice cream on sticks- it was good quality ice cream and we could really taste the mango/ raspberry in the ice cream! And because it was half of the usual ice cream size, we could take many flavours to try :) I love that ice cream! Only thing is it is really very expensive to eat there.. if it was not for the 1 for 1 promotion, I would not have went. Nonetheless we enjoyed ourselves there and the service was good too- they sang a birthday song for my mum! Thank you 333! :
1
It's priced at $75. I do not know in what way it is worth so. The once well known buffet seems to be prepared for the 1for1 promo, at a value of $45. Even at that price, the Edge is better. The seafood station, so-so cos the crab is difficult to eat and lobsters too salty, the dim sum, disappointing, nothing with prawns and too much meat stuff. Sashimi is good though, though no hamachi.Ice cream is good. Overall Jap station is good. My Japanese companion was very disappointed and we will not return. Good for meat lovers
5
The Sunday family brunch was excellent for its lobsters, oysters, and crabs, wagyu beef and roasts. Ask for a table by the window for views of Orchard Road during your dining. Finished plates are cleared quickly by the attentive waitresses. Overall a pleasant experience
4
The seafood on ice is delicious but it could have more variety. I went there for lunch and there was no oyster. Sashimi is very fresh and yummy. I don't fancy the cook food selection and it could have been more selection.
4
This is my 2nd visit! First was Christmas lunch with colleagues and this time was treated to a sumptuous dinner buffet! Quality sashimi, fresh seafood, steak grilled to perfection! Attentive waiting staffs, big open spaces for large crowds and quiet corners for intimate convos. There's something for everyone and for every occasion! Highly recommended!
4
This restaurant is located at the Mandarin Orchard Hotel but their food are superb. They have one of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore and their chef is one of the pioneers in cooking chicken rice. They also serve many types of Singapore food. Their concept is like a hawker center but in a restaurant setting.
3
The seafood (oyster, sashimi, lobster and etc) is super fresh. However, one of the things that I feel it is lacking is the choice of drinks (there is only sky juice, tea, coffee and ordering a single coke cost additional $10++). Although the lobster is super fresh and yummy, you will still have to be lucky enough to enjoy it. If you really want to enjoy the lobster and afraid that you might miss it as and when you walk by, just stand at the counter and stare at the chefs. Variety of food is relatively lesser as compared to other hotel's buffet dinner, but the quality makes up for the lack of variety. Overall, I feel the price you pay is more for the freshness of the seafood, but to me good food requires good drinks to pair with. As for the ambiance wise, it is a buffet place, can't expect too much, everyone is just close to each other
5
Huge variety of food and great atmosphere. Can get rather crowded during lunch but not to the point where it's unbearable. Loved the dessert bar!
3
I hosted a dinner for 11 family members (8 adults and three children) on 2 July for dinner. It was suppose to be lobster night. But the restaurant started serving lobster at around 7.30 pm. Even then we have to join a long queue. The same for other delicacies such as steaks and barbeque prawns. The way the food are prepared and the resultant long queue have deprived dinner from enjoying these delicacies.The reception staff need to be more sensitive. Her reminder, particular the way it was conveyed, that I have to give advance notice for increasing the number of dinners, give the impression that we are dining for free. Furthermore their phone number used to confirm the booking, should carry the name of the hotel or restaurant. I believe most people, like me will not answer call from unfamiliar phone number.This is my fifth visit to this restaurant and I wish the standard will improve so that I can justify further visit in future.Chris N

We just a great meal with foie gras as their special for the evening along with the International Buffet with great seafood.For those who love sea food, it is a must ! It comes with mud crabs, alaskan crab, oysters, prawns, mussels , etc. Those Japanese aficionado will be very happy with the array of sushi & sashimi. There was something for everyone .... teppanyaki, Tempura & soba !Foreign visitors who may want to try some local cuisine, we have dim sums, laksa and mee rebus. Its interesting that there is a full section of Northern Indian with Naans, prathas & biriayni accompanied by a range of curries.Roast Beef, Ham, Yorkshire pudding and a range of hot vegetables accompanied the roast. The salad bar is so very complete that we could easily just have salads alone.For those with a partiality for desserts , a full range of cakes, complete with the chocolate fountain, cut fruits and ice creams !What else can you ask for ?
5
It is my first time back in Triple Three after many years, and it has been a most enjoyable time. The food was excellent. The portion was generous. And our server was always attentive.
5
This is the second time we had their lunch buffet. We made our reservation about a month in advance as this place is very popular and thus fully booked.The buffet has a wide spread. There are many live stations, like the carving station where the roast of the day is ribeye and honey baked ham, the pasta station, tempura, teppanyaki and of course the seafood. We like the desserts with various cakes and the ice cream on stick. Various types of drinks were available and a coffee machine for your cuppa.The staff are very attentive and efficient. As it was one of our family member's birthday, we were given a slice of chocolate cake lit with a candle. The staff would sing a birthday song too if you like. We really enjoy our food and the ambience and Triple Three would be our choice for our next gathering
2
The variety was limited and seafood wasn't fresh for the price at $78+++ per pax. The place was cramped and food was replenished slowly at the buffet
5
Wonderful Buffet. Nicely grill mentai lobster and scallops!! Fresh oysters and sashimi! Great buffet dinner!
3
live seafood could have more choices.service was acceptable.wanted to change from a table of four to six two days before but was told tat the place was at full capacity but on the actual day, saw many tables were empty even up to end of lunch timing at 1415 hrs. not sure why
5
If Singapore is to be considered famous for anything, it's buffets would definitely rank as special to Singapore. Triple Three's buffet line is not very big, but it is certainly one of, if not the best. Many live stations, food choices from all over the world, and a good dessert spread. What more could you ask for. Only issue is the cost, which is definitely more than the usual cost one pays for a buffet in Singapore.
4
The buffet spread was quite extensive and tasted good. They had japanese station, pasta station, roast of the day, carving station and not forgetting the sashimi and the cold seafood sectio
2
Went for the 1 for 1 lunch buffet but was disappointed with the spread . I'd say quality was not bad but even with the promo , I'd say price is not justifiable . too high for a normal variety buffet . Staff was too enthusiastic when it came to clearing our plates with two different staff asking us concurrently if they could clear it when I aldy mentioned I'm still not done (thru out our lunch )
2
Good: location and the brand of the hotel is quite prestigious. There are many promotion activities with banks so that you might get a good deal without paying the full fare.Not so good: they need to reconsider the food spread and the queue, its always crowded and hard to walk around. The food selection was rather limited compare to the other hotel buffet restaurants
5
Highly recommended for lunch and dinner, for birthday celebrations and even if there's no occassion. Everything was tasty from the bread to the steak to seafood. Will definitely come back. :
5
Food and restaurant environment overall are good. They have kid's corner can let kids to play so that parents can enjoy the food
2
I brought my mum over for lunch at triple three yesterday and we were disappointed in the food served, miserably 6 small pieces (0.5cm X 4.5cm X 0.6cm)of salmon belly when served to us, perhaps the chef wanted to keep the thicker bigger salmon belly for later use but did not hide it proper. The only decent fish is the salmon (size 5cm by 3cm) cooked in small aluminum dishes, and fish curry at Indian section. The tempura prawns were pathetically fried 4 pcs each time. If someone before your queue took it, you have to settle for the vege or mushroom tempura, and come back to try your luck again together with the long queue of seminar attendees. We do not take beef, and ham, so our variety shrink. Frankly, I expected better coffee beans standard from this 5 star hotel standard coffee house but the coffee is served from the Nescafe machine which I can get the same complimentary coffee when I visited Tan Tock Seng hospital.

Highly recommend this place if you want quality buffet food. Second visit this time was on a night with a wagyu theme - with Japanese twist. Making reservation was easily done online with current buffet promotions stated in a drop down menu if it was available (50% off for second diner was available for UOB cards) Buffet starts as 630pm for dinner but already has quite a queue. You are shown to your seat and was waited on by the same service staff Valerie as my previous visit. She started off by inflating the handy napkin with water and got our drinks order. Water, coffee and tea were included in the buffet. Valerie and another trainee staff regularly checked on the tables in the same section to clear used plates and replaced drinks. Both were very proactive in servicing the tables. The buffet food stations were plenty and all manned by chefs - (see photos)1.tempura fried on the spot with light batter - prawn, white fish, capsicum, sweet potato were nicely laid out and freshly cooked as well2. Japanese Steamed egg with roe; steamed buns and rice section3. Thai noodles section (didn't try this) 4. Prata and curries- the fish curry went very well with the egg prata 5. Freshly shackled oysters 6. Sashimi - place your order and the chef will slice it up right in front of you. This section also has the sushi rolls and Japanese noodles7. The seafood section on ice- crab claws n cold crabs, mussels and prawns 8. The pork section with cured meats 9. Pasta/risotto section - samples on display of what you can order - highly recommend the lobster risotto and the squid ink risotto 10. The carving meat station with wagyu rack and ribeye; and honey baked ham...11. Beef rice bowl with onsen egg and teppanyaki beef section - went for two servings here!12. Teppanyaki - super popular section with veggies, prawn and chicken teppanyaki served freshly cooked13. Huge cheese and bread section with hot vanilla sauce! 14. Fruits and desserts - ice cream on a stick! No need to deal with a messy scoop! 15. the drinks section with two machines dispensers for coffee/teaLots of variety and great quality food too. Great choice if you are planning that special date, family dinner or birthday with friends! PS it was my birthday celebration dinner and the service staff all came with a candle lit brownie cake singing happy birthday! One bad point would be the smell from the teppanyaki station tends to permeate the clothes - so if you don't want to have a food smell lingering afterwards, request for a table away or in another section from the cooking stations.

I went for the lunch buffet on 20 May and was impressed by the quality of the food. There was a nice selection of fresh seafood, sashimi, sushi, roasts, teppanyaki, fried and other cooked foods, as well as an impressive array of desserts. The selection is a little smaller than some other places (eg Edge at PanPac or The Line at Shangri-La), but what it lacks in quantity, it more than makes up for it in quality. The focus seems to be skewed towards Japanese food, so if you're a Japanese food lover, this is a great place to go. Service was also efficient without being intrusive, and the cosy setting is suitable for business lunches and small gatherings. The layout of the restaurant is a bit cramped, so not that suitable for families in my opinion. Recommended dishes are: roast beef, teppanyaki beef, sashimi, customisable pasta. The DBS 1-for-1 promo makes this a value for money lunch too
4
At Triple Three for lunch, was pretty much blown away at the variety of cuisines available, only to be further amazed at the quality of every offering they had.A common starter for most buffets, sashimi. Thick cuts of super fresh salmon belly, tuna, and octopus served to whet my appetite for what was to come. Freshly prepared prawn and assorted tempura followed, light and deliciously battered. A teppanyaki counter with squid and tender chicken also beckoned with its lovely aroma, and finely passed the taste test.Chinese dim sum wad delicious, though it was dwarved by what I thought was a delicious prawn noodle soup. Almost going for seconds, I had to make the painful decision of not doing that when I saw what was next to the Chinese cuisine section. Naan, parotha, all manner of glorious Indian breads screaming for attention on the cast iron pan. And where there's Indian bread, delicious lamb curry, and fish tikka and briyani are not far away. Try a bit of everything I must. And they were simply marvelous.I finished off an amazing meal with sticks of chocolate and mango ice cream. And a teh tarik (self service from a Nescafe machine, the taste of which exceeded my expectations).In fact, this whole experience was a surprise to me. I've been to many buffet restaurants with vary amounts and varieties of food, but definitely not one that excelled in everything they served. Definitely one of my top choices now, many more visits to come
5
We are here to celebrate my son 21st birthday, food very nice, service excellent, will come again next time. Thank you
3
The food was not fantastic for the price paid. The seats were cramped . but over all the staff service are grea
4
Their seafood variety and spread was great and freshness was awesome, me and spouse love to visit here for our anniversary yearly.Great ambience. Drink wise is not nice to charge your guest on fruit juices or soft drink as the theme is already call buffet ! new guest will shock when they require to pay $10 exclude gst and sc per glass and their buffet easily cost $120++ . So for the management maybe need to revise on this issue if not they won't have repeat customer. Anyway their food still awesome deserve 4*
4
Buffet is very good with good ambience and setting. Food and service was good as well. It offers good variety for everyone and service is prompt and friendly
4
The food was great and especially loved the seafood Service was good and fast. Overall its a good experience.
5
Excellent service ! Food spread was good too ! If have more food choice for children will be good. Will visit again when they have special promotion
3
With the price paid, I would expect a much better seafood variety. Only prawns, clams & mussels. The rest are good
2
Went for the lunch buffet as there was a 1-for-1 promotion. Choices were not great at all. There were many choices for Indian cuisine and a pathetic Japanese counter (they served yakitori but only lamb meat and I don't take lamb meat). There's pasta and its either with tomato sauce or carbonara. We asked for Aglio Olio which was not understood so we said just olive oil. There's nothing delectable there that I can recommend. This - for the price of SG$ 46 per pax after using the promotional discount is totally not worth it. I wouldn't recommend anyone to try it nor will I try it again
4
Food was very good as expected. My second visit there. Ambience was good. Staff was polite. I wished they'll smile though, but I appreciate their hard work

Salmon sashimi quality not good. No swordfish for lunches, no oysters except for dinner and weekend lunches. Asked restaurant manager why no swordfish and he replied that it depends on the chef. Is it that it depends on the chef's mood? And he replied without empathy and is expressionless.Perhaps I came with high expectations. We get what we paid for

Excellent buffet which was served piping hot. Every dish was perfectly executed, with fresh oysters and foie gras being the highlight. Service staff were attentive and unobtrusive - special thanks to Grace for her great service which exceeded expectations

The greatest plus point for this buffet is the sheer number of live stations there are. Pretty much everything was done and prepared by chefs manning life stations, and this is a fabulous selling point for the restaurant. Compared to other buffets, there were very few food trays with heaps of food left over warmers - instead, pretty much everything was prepared on the spot. The food was awesome - from the lobster mentayaki, the teppanyaki beef and prawns, scallops, sashimi, prata, and even the ice lollies - all of it was done in a much more sophisticated and tasteful manner than most buffets. Literally everything was done on the spot - you could see the lobster mentayaki being torched just before it is served, the teppanyaki beef being cooked to perfection and then cut up in front of you, scallops were grilled and plated.However, in order for all the food to be served by the chefs in a life station, it means that there is a long wait. During the peak hour of 7 pm to 8 pm, everyone was queuing at every station there was. Its not unduly long, and its quite acceptable after you have tasted the food, but do be prepared. Once we crossed 8.30 or so, the crowds dwindle significantly. Here comes the reason why its just an average rating - it is incredibly chaotic, so much so, that it feels like we stepped into a downtown casual cafe, where heaps of people are dining all at once, and jostling around for food. The life stations are placed in 2 straight rows, and everyone is there queuing and waiting, in what is a very narrow pathway. For a place that packed so many people in, having only 2 rows of food was just inviting trouble. The tables are placed very close together and there is absolutely no sense of any ambience as such.We were there on a Saturday night, and we found it difficult to get the attention of service staff. Calling for the bill and getting it settled was a 15 minute affair and only after we chased for it. For the price paid, the ambience was poor, and it really did not do the food nor the concept of the life stations any justice. It is such a pity, as it truly was one of the highest quality food we have tasted in a buffet, but eating in a canteen like place just does not make it a coveted place to return to

was expecting oysters at buffet for price paid even for 1 for 1. Disappointed. Could have go to other hotels buffet which serve oysters at about the same price.
4
Good variety has dwindled compared to the past. However, the selection of Japanese food the restaurant has is of good quality.
4
Service was excellent. Staff were so attentive and friendly. But their lunch spread can be improve since the price is so expensive, should even consider if not for the 1 for 1 promo
4
Excellent services, food was good but not as much as Saturday lunch serve. Prices is value if is one for one.
4
Been there with my wife. Great food and great service. The location of this restaurant is amazing as it is in the heart of Orchard Road. Don't miss the sashimi( tuna and salmon) .. It is so fresh
4
The food here is quite good. The choices are also adequate, ranging from japanese, chinese, western to indian food.
I especially like their whole foie gras, which tastes really nice
Service is also quite good.

Will go again...value for money...all food was good...enjoyed octopus sashimi and tempura and ice creams
5
Spread of food was wide and varied, was very impressed with the quality. Service was fast and on point as well

just returned to the Mandarin buffet after a hiatus of 3 years. i already thought the buffet was expensive for the fare, in line with the hotel, but at least the previous experience gave me the feeling of plentiful choice.not anymoremaybe Friday lunch is not the best time. yet the restaurant did not appear to be full.sashimi counter was OK (tuna was certainly not on par with good Japanese restaurants, but this is a buffet after all).there were however quite a few counters which were poorly staffed : carving station not manned a couple times i passed by with not meat left to take. the tepanyaki counter proceed also by batch : when one is cooking there is a long queue and the batch is gone before the queue. yet instead of continuously preparing the cook goes away 5mn before restarting.dessert counter was over a third empty when i came to it (like 12:45 so not exactly at the far end of the service, and no one seemed to bother to refill.the consistent lack of refilling the service was the most striking point to me.cheese were good; salads and Indian dishes looked OK but i did not try (naan and prata were not very appetizing though).for the price at Mandarin, i expect better
3
The stations were all manned by chefs. Impressive! Cooked food were of good quality and high standards. Fried stuff were not repeated at least for the same dining session. Teppanyaki was good too.Service crew were quick and smart.However, Indian station is not to my liking. Prata and naan were too charred to the extent it tasted bitter instead of buttery (flavour I ordered). Sashimi chef looked grumpy and served food unwillingly. Restaurant was packed with people which made walking along stations slightly difficult when the crowd just entered.Highlight as usual was the Lobster bisque. Unfortunately, 1 pot is all there was. Managed to only get 1 serving. Recommended for 1-for-1. Otherwise you won't get much value out of the meal
5
Really wonderful food, with so many selections. And service was the best possible, the staff went above and beyond what would be expected. But a word of warning the price is high so ask before you are seated. Our Friday night buffet was SG$160 each but as hotel guest we received a 20% discount.
3
It's slightly chaotic with lots of family around. Table setting is slightly squeezy for us, we have to squeeze through the seats to get to the buffet line. Waitress was hard to get as well as i think the dinner crowd is huge. Overall the food is nice such as the beef steak, ham, naan and salmon with lots of variety. However, their risotto station was awfully done! Its tasteless and the toppings (lobster defrosted in sink for 5mins & boiled) are tough, i tried 2 different types. The lobster mentaiyaki sauce was fantastic but the meat was very tough as well. I guess overall the experience is nice, service is nice, but there is still need for improvements
3
Food was fine but the service could have been better. Service crew miscalculated my bill and insisted I should submit my credit card first. I would suggest to the service crew team to be competent in their knowledge in explaining the cost breakdown to their customer first before requesting for their credit card
5
nice food n good service,This is my first time there but will go again. My children love the food very much. Thank you.
3
The restaurant wasn't even aware of my booking...took them some time to check.was a bit disappointed that this should happen
4
Had a pleasant experience dining there. Food was good, service was excellent! Left a comment that it was my boyfriend's birthday and they surprised us with a slice of cake & birthday song sang by the crew ☺️

Was there for a business lunch. Large buffet spread. As i didn't want to pig out infront of my customers, just went straight to the food that i liked. Japanese food was good especially the salmon sashimi and octopus. The other chinese food there was above average. The chocolate mousse dessert was lovely. Service was good as they changed the plates quickly.

fantastic variety of food, good quality, lovely services. I was focusing on the seafood corner: oysters, crab legs, shells, prawns....sushi/sashimi, baked lobsters.....there are an impressive indian/vegetarian selections and a lovely cute dessert corner which ladies are crazy about it.service has been good and attentive, as long as you ask any waiter/waitress would be there to help. Remarkable Tannie (I hope I got your name correct) you did impress me! Thank you for your great services on the bill settlement.a bit suggestions:1) crab legs could be cut in a way better manner - so that ladies do not need to struggle to get the meat out2) cheese corner: very average choices, and the presentation isn't friendly enough for people to take and go.3) Parma Ham corner: it can be a highlight - but it is kind of 'invisible' putting it next to the tempting/smoky hot roasted beef..

The first time we ate here was in May, and it seamed to me that it was a pricey experience. This time, we could not find any other place open (Chinese new year), and we brought our kids as well. The food was as good as I remembered. I had the miso soup, octopus sashimi, and a couple of deserts. My wife had the Wellington beef, and the salads. After living in Singapore for a couple of months, definitively its pricey, but worth it. Singapore's restaurants are like this, but believe me, I will come back
2
Was staying at the hotel , buffet was ok very focused on sea food , staff could have been friendlier , but at $108 per person way way over priced , compared them selves to a top class restaurant in Singapore when I questioned why so expensive , well next time I shall visit one of those restaurants and not waste my money here
5
I brought my mum there for lunch and we enjoyed the ambience along with very friendly staff! Especially special thanks to Gina Toon and John Wee. They were very attentive and friendly, making sure we have an enjoyable meal, offering coffee, refilling our water and constantly changing our plates. Thank you so much for making it a pleasant lunch for us
5
What we enjoyed most about our experience dining here was the level of attentive accorded to us. We were shown to our seats swiftly but hesitantly asked for a change of tables to the window-side which the hostess pleasantly obliged.The buffet was well spread out, though I personally felt it a little cramped particularly at the area where the main dishes are. The spread mainly focuses on seafood, with sides dedicated to Indian cuisine (a standout) and dim sum. Local dishes are bak kut teh and laksa.Back to service, we would like to commend Jenny, who from our little chat with her; found out that she is a part-time team member. Jenny constantly ensured that our plates were cleared promptly and our table kept clean. Well done, Jenny

Very disappointing buffet. Especially when they're charging $78++ per pax. Was full of expectations after hearing raving reviews of this place. I got to keep checking if I am really at the right place as I couldn't believe how dismal the buffet was. Granted, it's not as bad as some other buffets but those worse off are cheaper and with less reputation. This is Mandarin Hotel we're talking about! The variety was not that great. But my greatest gripe was the quality of food. Even my son who's usually a prawn lover didn't take a second helping of their cold prawns, which really goes to show how poor the quality was. This cold dish was just chilled boiled prawns. No master culinary skills involved and yet it left much to be desired. The shrimps were small and not that fresh. The dim sum was pathetic - tough and dry har gao. The only positive was the ambience of the restaurant. And the coffee was not too bad. Service was mediocre. Staff changed our dishes quickly enough. But can improve on their friendliness
3
The buffet quality and variety was good, but I found that the service level did not match, especially since the buffet price was about $100 per person!
4
The 1-for-1 promotional offer that was available for Sunday brunch made it super value for money. The highlight were the oysters and the lobster thermidor! The service was not up to a 5* hotel restaurant but was decent enough not to have any complaints.
4
We all love the Tuesday special (Truffle) very much! Very fresh and prompt serving. Good service too.
4
The mini steaks and lobsters are great! The sashimi and oysters are fresh. The chocolate ice cream is good. Overall, we're satisfied with the variety of food.

I was there with my wife and extended family for my father's birthday. We had made a last minute booking for a dinner on a weekday night and booking was a fuss free process. The food spread that met us was extremely sumptuous. As it was the Christmas period, there was much Christmas staples like Roast Turkey, Ham, Lamb, etc. In addition, the Singapore Laksa and Indian Food were really good as well. The dessert was in my opinion one of the best desserts options amongst most Singapore Hotel restaurants. All in all, an enjoyable experience and worth another visit
4
Among the best buffets in town; with many varieties suiting the tastes of the young to the old. On Sundays, the kids can enjoy face/body painting plus balloon sculpting and simple magic performances by a roving balloon sculptor. Good food plus good and attentive service everytime

THANKSGIVING dinner with wonderful friends made even better by Triple Three!Beautifully decorated Christmas Tree & Xmas House at entrance immediately lift the celebratory spirit ! Warm welcome by hostess upon arrival and our wine were immediately taken to chill in a bucket already set by our table. Buffet spread is HUGE with many live stations and adequate chefs manning the stations and interacting with guests. Fresh and chilled seafood on ice and freshly shucked oysters from NZ. wide food varieties from cold, hot, sweet, action stations and presentations are very nice. Ambience is good and many partitions to provide more privacy n cosines.Service was warm and efficient led by Jonathan Pillai. Overall good value buffet and have already recommended to many friends to try. Thumbs up to all at Triple Three and MERCI for a GREAT dining experience ! Best regardsCatheryn & friendsSingapore

We booked Triple Three for my birthday dinner and decided to go on Foie Gras Tuesday (since everyone in my family loves foie gras). When we arrived, we headed straight for the foie gras with daikon radish. The sous chef promised 4 dishes (one per pax) but when the queue starting building up, only gave us 3 and rudely told us to come back later. We were extremely upset at the way they spoke to my husband and father-in-law. Time and time again when we went back to get that foie gras dish, we were treated rudely. The other foie gras dishes (foie gras terrine and salad) were not refilled at all during our entire dinner experience (we started dinner at 7pm and left at around 9pm). The leg of pancetta was also sitting at the counter and yet no one bothered to slice it. I waited around the pancetta to see if anyone would help me (there was a chef waiting at the roast ham just nearby and she clearly ignored me). When I spoke to her, she just shouted at her colleague to do something about it (in the end though, there was also no pancetta for the rest of the evening). Our prata had hair in it and the cheese section had fruit flies all around. For $88++, this is definitely not hotel standard in comparison to other hotel buffets like The Line at Shangri-la and Edge at the Pan Pacific which are priced similarly. Even though there was an offer of 50% off the second diner, and perhaps they were short on manpower (which could explain the long waiting times for the food) it was clearly horrendous service and sub-par food. Food may be excusable but service is something extremely important in a hotel / F&B situation. Perhaps it is a one-off because it was a public holiday but unfortunately, it would be the first and last time here for my family.

I wouldn't eat here unless it's for hotel breakfast.As far as breakfast goes it's not the best I have had and it's not the worse.Overall only go if breakfast is included in your room...otherwise there are plenty of outlets for nice breakfast in the area where the hotel i

we went on a saturday dinner for a birthday celebration. it costs about SGD128++ per person, and this does not have any drinks included yet except for water, standard coffee or tea. for me, it was really expensive based on what i have eaten and the service and everything else. it was not hotel-standards. Pros:1. Wagyu beef - really good, melts in your mouth2. Fresh seafood - oysters, king crab, salmon, etc3. The Indian food tasted pretty good, considering it was Japanese themed dinner that nightCons:1. Expensive2. Drinks not included - regular coke costs SGD10 + SC and GST3. Most food have mediocre taste - IMHO, food at a normal restaurant are better4. As we are brown-skinned from a third world Asian country and most of the diners were either Caucasian, rich-looking locals and foreigners, we felt like we were ignored most of the time and more attention was given to the rest. Yes, we were dressed to impress as this is a 5 star hotel.5. Desserts were plenty. However, the serving utensils were either missing or not appropriate for the dessert itself. It was very impossible to get a cake without ruining the cake itself.6. Dessert spoon/fork not available7. Soft serve ice cream tasted like medicine8. Food from the Japanese grill either burnt and bitter or raw and coldif my credit card did not have a 50% off promotion on second diner, we will not go and even try it.Will not go back
4
Enjoyed the dinner there. Food was good albeit price is a bit steep. There was a Hokkaido fair going on so price went up to $128++.
5
The spread of buffet was very good! Oyster is open up upon request and very fresh. Beef station is awesome! Desserts have cakes, fondue, ice creams n fruits.. Very good exprience. Staff is very prompt.
3
Buffet dinner was quite good with variety of food. Main stars for me was the coconut ice-cream and fresh sashimi. Probably more worth it to dine when there is a promotion.
5
We dined on a Tuesday night and they were serving foie gras in the buffet line. Great variety and excellent quality food. Service was impeccable too.
5
Fabulous variety of food not to mention that they were good to the palate. Service was friendly and attentive when required.

I had eaten at this restaurant twice in a span of 1 month and the food spread reamins the same for the buffet.An above average rating is for the following aspect:1. Briyani rice is the local version using the tumeric to color the rice grain. Whereas the Northern Indian version is moist and light brown in color. The latter version has a rich fragrance of the spices used. Other than this the Indian counter is above average.2. The Tuna, and Salmon served for Sashimi had been kept cold in the counter top chiller for quite some time to the extent of tasting the coldness in the fish meat. I do understand that the raw fish meat has to be chilled to prevent deterioration, could have consider warming it to room temperature for a short duration.3. The roast beef and chicken is a bit on the dry side. The beef had lost its juiciness and I can't taste the beef. The roast chicken was dry as well as I had tried the portion between the thigh and the rump. This triangular portion had become dry and the meat was more or less could be shredded by the fingers.4. The Laksa and Prawn Noodle counter was good. The Laksa gravy was rich but overwhelming. The prawn noodle soup was done to the right flavor.5. The service staff was prompt, efficient and attentive. A well trained crew of service persons.6. The rest of the counters are above averag

Triple 3 offers buffet lunch. The variety of Food is ranging from Western to Asian including Japanese suishi. The restaurant is large in size where we found not noisy and customers can sit quite comfortably. Quality of Food is good. The service is also good that you have quick responses from staff all the time

Arrived & did not have my reservation despite hotel confirmation 4 hrs before dinner. Ambience was poor. Birthday arrangement never materialised. 
5
Pricey but you do get what you pay for. They have an impressive array of seafood and Japanese food. The oysters are flown in daily are only shucked upon oder. The sushi and sashimi bar spread is excellent. On select nights, they may serve the Lobster Mentaiyaki which is to die for! They have several, live cooking stations. I highly recommend Triple Three

Heard and read so much about this place so booked lunch to celebrate a girl friend' birthday. When the stations started serving, I went to the sashimi counter to check on the food. 'Chef' were pretending not to see me until I've to call out to him and requested for 3 slices of sashimi. Even then he was like serving me and the others very reluctantly. I simply cannot stand the way most of their so called 'chef' service. The look and attitude they displayed was like customers were a bunch of greedy eater! I was even more disgusted when my girl friend and I decided not to follow the queue and walked towards the Japanese tempura counter. There were pre fried pieces of sweet potato lying. When he saw us he just pointed to it and gesture us take those and totally ignore us. We told him we would like to have a piece of the prawn tempura and he gave us the very unfriendly look as if we were such a pain! I went around looking at the counter 'chef' and the food they served, most were having this bad attitude! While waiting for this unfriendly 'chef' to fry 2 tiny piece of tempura, I walked over to the tiny cheese section. Was even more amazed when I ask for a particular cheese that was almost finish, I was told rudely by the 'chef' that they do not replenish. Take whatever is there! Obviously we did not enjoy our lunch with this type of attitude put up by the staff. I eat out almost everyday lunch n dinner at different places but this place has to be the worst feeling I had. They made me feellike I'm a beggar going round begging for food!! Worst place ever!

I was there for lunch and the Indian Food was delicious.The cook Krisnan was attentive to serve all customer.His Prata was crispy and the chicken curry was good.The briyani rice was fragrant and I was very satisfied
3
Atmosphere: good, not too noisy
Service: excellent, very friendly service staff (Indian chefs have problems trying to smile)
Food quality: good
Food variation: food courts have better variety....
Price: average
In short, just an 'ok' place. Why? Too little variety of food...

Stayed at the Mandarin Orchard April 2015, the buffet breakfast was enormous and catered for everyone's taste. We also had dinner there the American Buffet, very over priced we thought but, we are not big eaters but the food quality was A1.
3
Buffet breakfast included wide variety. Does close promptly at 10:30am for breakfast. Service was quick and staff friendly
4
The restaurant is in the MANDARIN ORCHARD HOTEL, 5 level. The food is of buffet style, thought one can also order from main menu. There are of International style viz: Japanese, Chinese, European, Indian....Of these the Japanese seems to be most popular. The Japanese dishes are very fresh and good; while the Western dishes are also well prepared. The choices are good and quality good. The desserts counter is also good both in quality and choice. Service is good and ambience acceptable. Though the price is slightly higher than most of the other hotel outlets, but the quality of food makes it worth the while.

My wife reserved the buffet lunch at Triple Three last Friday, we arrived around 30 minutes late due to traffic but the receptionist is still able to arrange a table for us. Generally speaking, the spread was ok if you compare to other hotel buffet, but considering the name of a Mandarin hotel, i think it should be better. The seafood zone was fresh, the clam, crab and mussels were very good. But the sashimi station was the worst i ever had in Singapore; I dont know how can they arrange a amateur at the sashimi station, the first time we had tuna, there are some parts are not chewable, and the second time, still the tuna was as thin as paper. The rest of food are ok, we liked the tepanyaki and Japanese fried food. The last thing we could not accept was they offered plastic spoon for dessert, which is very weird, we dont know if its the result of cost down but not very good when you expect to dine in a 5 star hotel

.Despite making a reservation for Saturday Dinner Buffet,Staff gets SIMPLE details WRONGand keeps everyone waiting needlessly.Restaurant is like a canteen.Tables placed SO NEAR, I could lean over and share the next table's food.Food is DULL.Taste of all the food is non-descript.Lobster is weak and MUSHY, no firmness of flesh.The Indian section has been left unattended, chicken COLD.The many cooking staff fail to engage the diners.Replies are mono-syllabic, far from inspiring.Deserts are run-of-the-mill fruits UN-IMAGINATIVE.Over 10 types of petit cakes.No ice cream, no chocolate fondue fountainInstead you get miniature ice lollies .. how very childish !!Not a single staff bothered to ask diners about their dinner.What is a restaurant without good food and decent service?NOTHINGand for that you pay $115 per person (without alcohol)BAD CHOICEYup ... Definitel

Had lunch buffet last week, but was surprised with the limited variety for the cost of the meal (S$80 a person). Nice ambience, food was good, and staff were very courteous and prompt in clearing the dirty plates and refilling our drinks. I believe there was a buy 1 get 1 free promotion if you have a local credit card, or a 20% discount otherwise. Lunch was from 12 - 2.30pm
1
I went for their breakfast buffet , 2 of us spending $89. I 'm utterly disappointed with the food they served . The variety and the quality of food is not worth $38++ per pax .here are the food they served : fried bee hoon , mini wu xiang , prata, bread, sausages, bacon, ham , fried rice, salad , indian thosai , mee soup, mini pau, yam cake (not much ingredient) scramble egg , meiji yogurt , fruits, cereal . it a 5 star hotel but the quality of food is not up to the standard . there are many hotel serving much better breakfast then them
5
I been here few years back and i am here again with my husband for lunch. As usual the seating area and the ambience was comfortable. The buffet spread was nice and had quite a variety of dishes(japanese sushi and sashimi, tepanyaki, dessert, local dishes and seafood like prawns, crab and etc.) to choose from. The chefs was very nice and professional at their each and individual station. The overall was good and i would visit this place again
4
Casual dining with cakes, coffee, tea and soft drinks. Friendly and attentive staff. nice place to meet up with friends.
3
I like their crabs that were sweeter than those I tried at other buffets. What impressed me was the way they cut the crab that simplified the dinning experience.Unfortunately, the sashimi was a disappointment. It was not very fresh and 3 pieces were offered per serving, while the sushi failed both in taste and presentations. I would NOT expect the sushi to crumple when I took them but they did. The fruit was not replenished even though it just passed 9pm. The other frustration was the service. Not only were we given the wrong credit card, bill, we had to wait a long time for water and the correct bill. Salad and dessert selection were average, so was the rest of the pre-cooked.I can't say this restaurant is worthwhile given the quality of fond and service.
5
I had lunch with my family on 4/Feb at triple three. Lots of choices; Fresh sashimi; wide variety of seafood selection; Good environment & attentative friently service staff gave me a great experience... with 1 for 1 credit card promotion, definately it is value for money. Will recomend to my friend..

REVISITED this restaurant for lunch on 4Feb2015, and find it is now an DISAPPOINTMENT!!! The food stations are same as previous viz: Japanese, Western, Chinese, Indian. The Japanese station proves to be most popular while the Indian the least (who will pay $80/person for Indian food when there are outlets offering better quality Indian food at almost 1/4 the price). 1)The choice of food is POORER; the seafood section has only cheap mussel, clam and no oyster. The crab claws are not cracked, and when asked for claw cracker and been told NOT AVAILABLE! Some inexperienced dinners trying to crack the claw with their teeth (poor teeth and likely to be cracked by the claw)!!! 2)The attitudes of the chefs(???) in both the TEMPURA and Tappanyaki sections are AWFUL. There was no prawn in the Tempura section; when asked the chef for it; I was told to come back later with a soured face, even when there was nobody at the station, and the chef was doing nothing then!!! Likewise, encountered same experience, when asked for bean sprout in the other section!3)The quality of food in the other stations are poor; as few dinners visit these stations, so the food is left over, reheated, and standing for long time!!!There are many other (4 and 5 stars) outlets in town offer much better value for money in the ways of SERVICE, FOOD QUALITY, FOOD CHOICE....etc. ROTTEN APETITE!!

I am a regular visitor at Singapore and stay mostly at Mandarin Orchard since more than 10 years. Sadly this trip I found the staff at the Buffet breakfast restaurant Triple Three at Level 5 to be outright rude and unfriendly especially some of the Indian origin staff at front and waiters at the restaurant itself. Food variety at morning buffet is as usual good with the rush during breakfast time. But the bitter taste of having to face such staff at a five star restaurant is unprecedented. Although some staff are friendly enough but having to request for anything to some of these rude staff you get a cold answer: "Wait a minute" and then nothing happens. If you ask for it again after some time the reply is "Told you to wait a minute". How can you simply accept such behavior when customer satisfaction remains the utmost target for all service organization. If this restaurant were not in this hotel I would never visit again. I am utterly diasappointed and appalled at the utter disrespect for customers at this restaurant.

This is my 2nd visit. My 1st time was international buffet dinner and this time we have lunch buffet on 23rd Dec with my colleagues. It was a very attractive offer(1 free for Citibank credit card ) especially on this period.A day before, I asked the restaurant staff, the difference between lunch and buffet when she called to confirm the reservation. I was a bit disappointed when I had been told it is big difference that lunch does not have oyster and lobsterFrankly, I never put high expectation on the lunch buffet anymore on the day we go. However, it does brighten my day again when I saw the foods. It was actually not really much difference. Cold dishes , Japanese foods, sashimi, sushi, teppanyaki , dim sum, Indian foods, local food like laksa, desserts , ice creams. I never tried because I am very full. What I can said is itâ€™s fresh, delicious and worth for the money we paid !! And, very good and professional staff here especially the lady who served us. Certainly, we come back again !

the buffet is expensive, but so is hotel dining in Singapore. The food choices are excellent and done first class. The service is slow, but any time you get up to go and get some more food, your plate is always removed before you get back. The only service that is slow is if you want a drink, but NOTHING to complain about

My family went here for buffet 2 Sundays ago. The food was good, there was a large variety of selection- Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Malay and dim sum etc, and the dessert was plentiful. The only reason I gave it a three star is because we had to wait for 30 minutes for the bill. When my mom checked with the waitress, she said that her card was in the cashier, and was still processing. Perhaps there was a shortage of manpower, but then again that was not reason for poor service. We were even more put off when we exited the carpark, as though with the complimentary car parking coupon from the Hotel, we were still charged 5 cents for the overtime. Anyway, it was just 5 cents, so my husband just paid for it

My family and I went here for buffet lunch today, as we are a regular of Chatterbox, so wanted to try something different. Thought that it would be fully booked, but to my surprise, there were a lot of empty tables. The buffet has a lot of sections, Japanese, laksa, asian dim sum, pork and satay etc. I was told to wait for 3 minutes for the chicken satay, so I went to get other buffet foods first; when I went back, still told me that the chicken satay was not yet ready, so I took the beef satay instead. The angus beef looked slightly raw, but the taste was not bad at all. The pork belly was not too fattening, and the sweet and sour pork was not sweet at all. In another selection, there was the teriyaka beef cooked on the spot, and we could pick the beansprouts. I also took the fried chicken cubes and a little bit of Fries. At this time, the chicken satay was ready, and I went to get it. The teriyaka beef was delicious, reminded me of what I used to have in Shima during my late dad's last year or so. My mom managed to get the laksa. My husband is a seafood lover, and he got the crab, which he complained that was too tasteless, as if they were being soaked in salt water. There were a wide selection of desserts too, and the fruits looked really fresh and appetising. I am not a dessert person, so I only got fruits for myself and my mom (as she is a diabetic, so could not take too much fruits, except for water melon). Was trying to figure out where is ice cream selection, but did not seem to see it. Maybe the hotel can enlighten me on whether they have taken out the ice cream selection section. Had lemon tea to finish off. Got 50% on 2nd person when paid with DBS card, so my husband used his card to pay. Overall, really worth the money if you are a seafood lover, and the choice is limitless, which you probably cannot finish trying all of the items in one meal. Would have to go back another day. Price is about $70 plus per person, excluding GST

The buffet is described as international. But to me unfortunately it is for locals and Asians. There was no western dishes at all apart from a car very but the meat was very rare. There was lots of fresh shell fish if you are into that kind of thing. On the plus side the service was very attentive and very friendly. Quite expensive I thought for a buffet though at 80s$

I found the food to be ok and every expensive for what was on offer. For breakfast I would recommend many of the delis or pattisieries outside of the hotel

gerat range of food, fresh and high quality, great service. They were very good with children in the restaurant and attentive to families.

As far as buffets go, this is one of the best. Great spread with numerous choices of good quality. Extended family dinner but the spread had something for everyone. Love the Japanese options which is of a very high standard for a buffet spread. Fighting the middle age spread so have been trying to avoid buffets but Triple 3 will always be difficult to resist

Located on the fifth floor of Mandarin Orchard Hotel, the restaurant offers buffet dinners with a different theme each day:- Monday (Crab Night)- Tuesday (Nippon Night – Includes Free Flow Japanese Beer)- Wednesday and Thursday (Beef Night - Kagoshima Wagyu Beef is served!)- Friday and Saturday (Lobster Night – Free flow of lobsters!)The restaurant has a good spread and variety of cuisine to cater to all appetites. The food is spread out across the following sections:- Bread Section: There were a variety of breads and cheeses- Seafood Section: I went on a Monday and it was ‘Crab Night’. There were a variety of crabs – Dungeness, Alaskan King Crab Legs alongside freshly shucked oysters, clams and prawns. Crabs were good!- Cold Cuts Section: Italian Parma Ham and various cuts of ham were available. I loved the parma ham.- Sushi & Sashimi Section: A chef mans this counter and you can order sashimi (salmon belly, salmon, tuna, octopus legs and more) and pick a variety of sushi from the counter.- Japanese Section: Here, you get freshly-fried tempura prawns, shitake mushrooms and sweet potato. Miso soup and hot soba noodle are also available here- Teppanyaki Section: At this live station, the chef prepared on the teppanyaki grill 3 items: Beef cut into cubes, prawns and bean sprouts. You can customise the preparation if you want.- Grill Section: At this live station, the chef prepares the specials for the day:o Alaskan King Crab Legs with Mentai and cheese: One of the popular items that is gone from the counter faster than the chef can replenish.o Escargot: Yummy!o Grilled mini Portobello mushrooms- Steamed and stir-Fry Section: Here, you can get Chamwanmushi and Chilli Crab with deep-friend mantou.- Indian Section: Mutton curry, Vegetables and freshly made naans were available. The naans were good. Eat them while they’re hot!- Roast Meat section: Roast Beef and Roast Ham was available. The beef is very done well and so was the mash potato on the side. Help yourself to the truffle brown sauce. This was my favourite dish for the whole meal.- Pasta Section: Here, your pasta is made to order.- Desserts: Chocolate fountain (fuits and marshmellow), live station (crepe suzette), ice cream (Choice of 4 flavours, freshly scooped) or icicle on a stick!Coffee and Tea are also included in the buffet. If you are looking for a good complement to your dinner, order a cocktail or two. We tried the Sangria which was quite potent (in terms of alcohol content!). The food has quality and I enjoyed it very much. On the night I was there, there were 3 birthday celebrations. The restaurant staff went to each table with a birthday cake and sang the Happy Birthday song. This gives me the idea to come by when I am organizing the next birthday gathering

I stayed at the Mandarin Orchard hotel for 5 nights. I chose to have the breakfast only on my last day. The food was typical, nothing fancy, but the waiters were so rude and inattentive. I won't even compare the service to other 4-5 stars hotels, this is even bad for a 2 stars. I asked for coffee like twice with the same waiter, she acknowledged but still no coffee. Finally got my coffee when I asked another waiter, and surprisingly without even looking at my cup, she just spilled the coffee and walked away without looking back
3
We stayed for 2 nights at the Mandarin Orchard and availed of their breakfast buffet at Triple Three. Surprisingly, the buffet food choice did not disappoint at all. They had different choices and it was okay. However the waiters (some not all), were not really friendly. On our 2nd and last day, when I asked for coffee from an Indian waitress - she did not even acknowledge if she understood what I wanted and passed on my order to the next waiter. It was rude and disrespectful. And since I was on vacation with my family, I did not want to spoil the rest of my stay just because of her. Anyways, the Filipino waiters were pleasant and attentive as usual

Have been there to celebrate 3 occasions in the past 10 months, Wedding Anniversary, Christmas and Birthday just three days back. Though the price is not very cheaper at $98 per person, we feel that it is worth every cent as the selection is very good from Baked Mentaiko Lobsters, Different types of Raw Oysters to Fresh Sashimi and on certain day, Foie Gras too. The dessert selection is fantastic too. The service is also very good from chefs to servers. Been to a number of hotels' buffets and although some food selection is not too bad, they often fail on service. However triple Three never fail us in term of attentiveness, friendliness and helpfulness. Cozy ambience too, not too big and there are several sections of dining area to make the whole place less noisy as compared to other big hotels

The view of this restaurant are nice, staff are friendly. Alots of foods are from local and i like it the most. My favourite food was choy kway , cold prawns and roti prata. Would recommend to my friends here is because nice food and variety. Staff approaching to customers are fast and polite. Chair are comfortable to seat.But the price of the buffet are expensive to enter but still can recommend to my friends because of the food are nice

Had my buffet dinner with friend. Nice food variety. Basically you can get to try quite a number of different country food here. Staff are friendly and welcoming. Everyone of them are smile to you. This make a lot of differences.i enjoy the environment there, quite peacefully and good place to take a break after long day work.in overall , good setting for meal, variety of food, welcoming, definitely will go again

This restaurant has good customer service but average quality of food. More importantly, they had some hidden costs which they will charge to the customer. Recently, we have an extended family celebration at this eatery i.e. 17 adults and 3 children. This was our first time (and last time) to patronise this eatery because of the DBS 1 for 1 lunch promotion. We did call several times to confirm that they will only charge 50% of the lunch which the reception responded in the affirmative. Unfortunately, when it comes to payment of the invoice, Triple Three charges more than the 50% discount i.e. additional charges. Despite pointing out to them their misrepresentation to the public (i.e. the customer will pay more than the 50% discount as entitled under the 1 for 1 promotion), Triple Three continues to insist on its right to charge the additional charges. This is unlike other restaurants (like Cafe Swiss (Swisstotel), CafeBiz (Traders) etc) where the customer only pays for one person when two are dining. The strange thing is that all these restaurants have subscribed to the same DBS 1 for 1 promotion but only Triple Three interprets that it has the right to impose service charges on ALL diners regardless of the 1 for 1 promotion. Please remember that service charges are kept by the restaurant while GST is imposed by the government. Thus, Triple Three has effectively given the customer a less than 50% discount! I have highlighted this matter to this forum so that you know that you will be paying more than what you thought you have agreed to pay

Had a business lunch at triple three, which is actually quite suitable since buffet style means fast service and sufficient choice for a large and diverse group. The quality is at a high standard with impressive touches, such a sashimi station with a chef cutting your selection of fish to order. There is also a large Indian station with freshly prepared Naan and Chapatti made to order. The staff is extremely attentive giving advice what food to taste first. I wish I had more than just one hour lunch breatk to keep tasting more items. Will return for a dinner buffet with more time to indulg

Do visit my blog at pangyixian.blogspot.sg for food review of the buffet lunch at Triple 3, Mandarin Orchard! :) "So last Tuesday, I was in for a feast at Mandarin Orchard Hotel's Triple 3 cafe/restaurant. The quality of food sure didn't disappoint, and I was particularly won over by specific cuisines. Managed to get quick snapshots of my preferred picks; the following are timeless choices that I'm sure, would appeal to international food lovers! .....

Consider this an expensive buffet. 2 adult dining will cost you $300sgd. Thankfully we have a 50% voucher to off set the price. That aside, I must say the food choices and seafood was really good. We had king crab and the claws were humongous. The flesh was fresh and juicy. Steam lobster was good but one is enough for me. Don't bother with the wagyu beef it was a disappointment. Full of fats and the meat is raw. Go for tepanyaki instead. The beef cubes are grilled to perfection. Not a dessert lover but the dessert section is quite impressive. However it ran out quite quickly.
4
The fresh oysters, sashimi and sushi, wagyu beef, teppanyaki, king crab and some desserts still pretty good. The Norwegian seafood theme was quite good/fresh but lack 'salmon belly'. Roast wagyu beef may be quite fatty for people who love lean meat. The S$128++ per head price tag is expensive so I only go when I get good promotional offers.
3
Company gathering again, I suggested to come here for international buffet this time because credit card offered 3 for 1 free.The atmosphere is not bad, staffs are very friendly. Overall are not bad, for me, i will spent more time for the cold dishes. The oysters, lobsters, sashimi... All very fresh! Cooked foods, Japanese, Chinese, india foods and teppanyaki also not bad. Just the variety is limited. My boss like the tepanyaki very much
4
This buffet has a very nice range of food selection. It boasts a wide range of live stations, but were inadequately staffed where there some stations which had 1 staff to 2-3 stations. The food item quality in terms of taste were good, but were not extraordinary. There was no dish that stood out. Was pretty disappointed that the sashimi and seafood lacked the freshness

Had a celebration dinner at Triple Three at Mandarin Orchard, Singapore. It's name comes from the hotel's address (333 Orchard Road), and this was my first visit after extensive renovation to the hotel in the past 2 years.There definitely has been a big jump in the quality of the food and cooking and the new decor very chic and understated. Compared to its previous location next to the swimming pool (which made it seem too casual), it's new spot now overlooks Orchard Road and the Christmas lights through floor-to-ceiling windows.It is an international buffet with cooking stations doing Chinese, Indian, and Japanese cuisine. We were there on a Thursday which featured Wagyu beef from Kagoshima in Kyushu. The wagyu was done either in shabu-shabu or teppanyaki style, or also from a carving. There was also beef sushi (a first for me) where the beef was seared on top of rice for sushi.There was also good representation of seafood (oysters, mussels, scallops, Alaskan king crab). The king crab was cut into pieces which allowed easy removal of the meat, without too much fiddling around.The dessert selection was quite wide but mainly pastries of Western origin. Some were not bad but by this time, I was already totally topped off on wagyu.So overall a great place to go as a group, with enough variety to suit everyone, and pace yourself during eating ! Check out whether any credit card discounts are eligible

The buffet spread was quite extensive but not very interesting to me. I wanted to try the Lobster Mentai, which was a special for the FRi & Sat buffet. The lobster mentai was good except it was only available quite late. We started at 1830hrs and only got Lobster Mentai about 1930 hrs. The Canadian oysters and shasimi were very good. Sushi was good. The teppanyaki and snow crab were also good. 'Bak Ku Teh' was too sweet and not spicy enough. Herbal prawn was good.More than S$100 spent would get complimentary parking at the hotel
4
I like their choices of the hot food such as fresh prawn in the Chinese wine soup, chawan mushi, teppanyaki beef n vege. deep fry tempura. N it's not like others hotel buffet which is pre cook. I love their two choices of the oyster, which some time they will open freshly for you especially the royale oyster. N their baked cheese lobster is the main attraction. Huh... Need to q for so long of time to get it n some time its finished fast same to the oyster. But still I came for more then 5 times..... :

The Triple Three buffet lunch boasts a wide selection of cuisines from Japanese to Italian to Indian to Chinese with stations for Salad, Seafood, Cheeses and Dessert. There are also live cooking stations for Noodles and Teppanyaki.However, some of these are just representative as the choices are rather limited, like the dimsum trio and tempura items.For the price, oysters are also not included for lunch.The wait staff seems to be rather busy though service is generally efficient
3
I wish there could be many variety of food in the various food counters. Food selections seem limited and unimaginative.

Years before they renovated, I used to visit this restaurant, which was then by the pool on the 5th floor of Meritus Mandarin Orchard Hotel, and enjoyed their grilled lobsters and roast which were fabulous, amongst other things like the chocolate fountain and cheese sticks. Although the price then was a little on the high side, we thought it was good value.Recently, we went there for lunch because of a credit card promotion. The hotel had an extensive renovation so the pool is no longer beside this restaurant. The food items have gone through some changes and feature a lot more japanese cuisine, eg sashimi, takoyaki, teppanyaki and tempura, as well as international selections like dim sum, naan and a noodle station. Instead of lobsters, the seafood feature was spanner crabs. Perhaps it was due to the restaurant being more crowded since it was a holiday, that the chefs' cooking were not up to standard, as we had quite raw beansprouts and very tough beef slices, as well as very bland noodle soup. However, most of the other food items were very tasty.Kudos to the hotel management for employing senior citizens. Unfortunately, training on customer service need to be enhanced as they were not able to answer questions, eg if I could change a table. I had to ask 3 different servers before I could get my answer.Compared with other buffet lines of around the same price, I felt that the selection of food items here was quite a let-down. It's unlikely that I will come back here again

Triple Three is one of the best executed gourmet buffets I have dined at and will not disappoint in either variety or quality.We dined the night before at Rise in the Marina Bay Sands which has an excellent diverse selection and great food however I preferred Triple Three for a more intimate atmosphere and the graciousness of the staff which felt closer to fine dining rather than simply being serviced.Mary, our dining service representative, made sure that everything was to our satisfaction. She was warm, welcoming and delightful - a major asset to the restaurant and hotel.A hallmark of the best high end buffets is their range of gourmet offerings and how they are presented. Triple Three's layout in two adjacent areas offered Indian, Japanese -Sushi, Sashimi & Tempura, Shellfish & Seafood, Custom Pastas, Breads, Cheeses, Pastries, Salads and Fruit.When we dined Tuesday evening they also had a fantastic chocolate buffet - beautiful to look at and better to eat!Guest staying at the hotel are extended a dining discount which made this a great value for the money and a delightful evening
4
This place is pricey. However, the variety offered is okay, not spectacular but will not be a letdown either. Food quality is slightly above average, and the service is pretty good. I come here periodically on fridays for the grilled lobster, while other buffets usually serve cold poached lobsters. For me, that's really the highlight. But call in advance for a booking and confirm before going
5
Went to triple three 6 years ago and was far from being impressed! Recently rediscovered the place and I must say, the quality of food, service and ambience is fantastic! My kids love it so much they ate extremely well! Have been there 3 times in 2 weeks and will definitely make this a weekly visit!
4
The spread is fantastic ranging from fresh sashimi to cook as you order teppanyaki and delicious cheese cakes for desserts. The dinner can get quite crowded so i would suggest a lunch time feast if you can afford the time (2hours at least to battle the spread here). Atmosphere is nice with dimmed lights buy not quite the quiet romantic place if you wish to romance your date - too much chattering, as what one would usually expect with a buffet spread.
4
Had family reunion dinner and had a really wonderful time. Ambience is really good but not too formal so you will feel relaxed while enjoying your food. Taste-wise, food are all delicious. Only thing lacking a bit for me is the variety. I would had changed the local chicken rice stall with thai food or laksa in my opinion. Indian food was really good and pork ham and roasted beef would take on second place.And not to mention the desserts. The cakes were not good though, even the cheesecake and carrot cake taste too dry and hard. But the rest were awesome- from the macaroons, panna cotta, tart, and chocolates were simply mouth-watering. Service was good and the chefs were all friendly and warm
3
Have to say the variety of food in the buffet is not that "fantastic", expecting a lot more. and the section that serve the dishes are respectively small. I will rate it "so-so" and will think twice to visit them again. Maybe since i have been to buffet at another hotel at the other end of the orchard road. I cant stop myself to do comparison between them
4
It was a Japanese inspired buffet where the food ranges from Japanese, Indian, Western to local. The spread was amazing and the staffs were exceptionally friendly & courteous. At a rate of SGD48++, I'd say it was well worth it.In the Japanese section, there were salad, sashimi, sushi, maki, teppanyaki and tempura all freshly served before your eyes. The Indian section served a variety of naan, curries, papadam & briyani rice.There were roast ham, lamb & beef for Western flavours in addition to the normal fare of bread, buns and soup.For the local section, there were roast duck (which I found absolutely delicious), char siu (marinated roast pork), pork leg in vinegar, fried noodles, fried rice, tim sum and chef's specialty. For dessert, there was a variety of local fruits, cakes, mousse and not forgetting ice creams with their toppings. I found the yuza sherbet extremely refreshing
3
Wagyu Beef from Kagoshima (Japan), Thyme Miso-baked Cod Fish, Lobster Mentaiyaki?The Wagyu beef was so so only, for that price, I expect better standardThe Cod Fish is still acceptable, but can be betterThere was NO Lobster at allONLY small Yabby at Seafood on Ice counterQuite disapppointing !Soft drinks n fruit juices do come freeflow but with a price tooOverall experience, NOT much variety, food was so so only Services was good Other than that, lots of room for improvementI m voting with my fee
2
The food quality was poor for it's price and service was bad.
1
For the price of the breakfast buffet quality of food was below standard
3
Buffet breakfast had an expansive spread, but there wasn't one dish that stood out - everything tasted like your typical hotel food (bland)
4
We had only breakfast at this reasturant. Very busy. An excellent selection. Quality of food good.
3
The cafe serves international lunch buffet of exceptional quality. The waiting staffs were well-trained. This is a good place to catch up with family members over a heavy lunch. The price tag is on the steep side (about S$90 per person).
4
Quite extensive choice of buffet and tasty too. Free flow cold water also included. The roast beef and pastas are my favorite...
2
For a buffet, the supposed international spread was very limited in choice compared to many other hotel buffets we've been too. The food was nothing spectacular.
Service was friendly but inefficient as we had to wait almost half an hour for the bill.

I went there with friends from Hong Kong for buffet lunch yesterday. They had a wide range of different varieties of food, though the silver fish and sword fish were missing (the last time we went there was over a year ago, and there were these items on their buffet lunch). There is also a good range of desserts. The ice cream (green tea) was absolutely delicious, though it had to be served by the man on the ice cream station. There were about 5 different varieties of ice cream, and 2 different varieties of sorbet. The only thing I would complain of is their pork leg, which had a smell.  The lunch was about $48 per pax. My husband paid with his DBS credit card, and got 15% off, so the lunch was really value for money
3
There is a selection of foods that one can choose but during our 3 days stay or 2 days breakfast at the hotel, the selection didn't change much. But, I have to say my husband and I enjoy their pastries - yummy. We were disappointed that we didn't get to taste the chocolate cake. We were waiting if another batch will be serve but there was none. Sad
4
Wide spread of international dishes. Lobsters, Oysters, Sashimi/Sushi, Roast Beef, Pasta, Indian, Desserts etc... Everything was great and the ambience was nice & cosy. Perhaps only the steep price of 100+ SGD per pax but thats for sure due to the seafood spread. We went because there was DBS Credit card 1 for 1 promotion which made it very affordable for a great meal out to starve yourself
3
the buffet breakfast in triple three is ok. it had all the basic offerings one would expect from a good hotel. i especially like the bread and butter but it didn't have smoked salmon which i had come to expect from buffets in hotels.
5
I liked that they have a variety of coffee and tea. I liked the breakfast spread.
4
Good spread of food and spoilt for choices. My last attempt was fruitful with lots of sashimi and oystres...
5
The lunch was fantastic! My favourite dish was the lobster! Think it was grilled with cheese... Though it was abit expensive and we have to wait for about 4-5 mins at times for our food to be ready but it's worthy! They had sushi..fresh salmon, tuna and oyster too though I am not an oyster lover...Fried noodles, rice, teppanyaki with prawns, salmon and bean sprout was available too

We made reservations for the Sunday lunch buffet as a small treat to ourselves. After later reading the bad reviews here we almost cancelled our reservations, but realized a lot of the complaints seemed to stem from dissatisfaction with a Groupon promotion around the end of 2011. So we decided to take our chances and try the restaurant for ourselves, and are glad we did.The Sunday International Lunch is $118 plus tax and gratuity (April 2012), so it is not inexpensive. But the quality of the food was quite good with ample selection to choose from.There was a good variety of seafood with lobster, crab, oysters, shrimp, smoked salmon, and more. Roasts at a carving station. Pasta and a grill station which we didn't try, but it looked decent. Sushi, sashimi and tempura of okay quality. Indian (didn't try), Chinese (didn't try), and cheeses and breads. There was also a very nice dessert station with quite a variety and some very nice ice creams.The wait staff was attentive and friendly for a buffet-style restaurant -- I would say "acceptable" for an upscale hotel, but this is not fine dining so our expectations were not at that level. The food station staff varied from good to having a "you're bothering me" attitude which was a bit unfortunate.One disappointment was that the hot dishes were hardly lukewarm at best.Overall it's a nice buffet, but not a great value. Still, we were satisfied with the meal and will probably go back in the future
2
I know the logic of providing poor standard of food due to the Groupon vouchers, but a reputable hotel and restaurant should never practise that. The food is lacking in variety, the chefs are rude, and the diners end up suspecting the good reviews given abt triple three is actually true.I would not even bother to patronize this place if there is a cheaper deal in future, knowing the dirty trick it has up its sleeves to manage diners' expectations.Don't bother eating there
1
I echoed the disgust post by the reviewer before me. I went there with my entire family after purchasing Groupon vouchers. Upon reaching the place, it was very crowded. Well, personally this doesn't bother me as i expect it to be crowded due to the Groupon deal. However, a few things really really pissed with me off.1. It is supposed to be a Groupon Voucher worth $72. For a voucher that is worth $72, you would expect good quality food. But, it was a total dissapointment. For the seafood section, there is absolutely no crab and oysters. I was totally misled by the picture shown on the vouchers, which clearly showed oysters, crabs and a variety of seafood. It was not even mentioned on the vouchers that the picture is for illustration purposes only!2. An Indian section with absolutely no curry. They served pampadon and asked us to dip it with dhaal?? There was a kid, which is approximately 10 years old, even asked where is the curry. After making much fuss about it, we observed the chef started cooking a pot of curry right in front of us. I fail to understand why there is no common sense in this establishment.3. The roast duck is out-right salty. Being a person who loves eating duck, i want to advice people with high BP to stay away from this dish. It is as though the Chef forgot that he had marinated the duck with salt and decided to coat it with another layer of salt.4. MSG MSG MSG... I have eaten at Melt, World Cafe and the food there is absolutely heavenly. For Triple Three, the MSG taste is so strong that after the meal, we just can't stop drinking water. It seems that Triple Three has really downgrade itself into using MSG to enhance its flavours and not based on any chef's skills. Pathetic!I would never ever want to go back to Triple Three ever again. The buffet is clearly not even worth $30+..let alone claiming it to be $72. My entire family feel so cheated and ripoff. Only consolation is that I have parked at Orchard Cineleisure which has a cheaper carpark. If I had also parked at Mandarin Orchard itself, it's like stabbing knives into both sides of my chest!!
2
Went there expecting wagyu beef, lobster,peking duck, good spread of sashimi and tempura as seen on a television review of good buffets in Singapore. Discover that there is only salmon sashimi, no lobster or wagyu beef roast or peking duck and miserable 2 types of tempura; vegetable and fish...no ebi!!Definitely not worth the S$89 per head. Better to pay another S$10 extra and come for the dinner buffet which apparently has all the above missing items. Real rip off!
2
We thought that Mandarin Hotel in Singapore should have one of the most acceptable standards in terms of hotel service...so when we saw this deal from Groupon Singapore, bought the 2 vouchers for the lunch time buffet.It turns out to be something unexpectable..when we reached Mandarin Orchard Hotel Triple Three restaurant, the poor receptionist was overwhelming with customers (not her fault if you read more of it later..)..There was sooooo many people crowded in the restaurant holding plates and long queues at certain counters like the teripayaki and peking duck. The chef who was chopping the ducks was signing with disappointment and also tired because of the crowd. Obviously the Management of this hotel did not do a good job and in fact bringing a bad name for the hotel itself. You can see the waitresses looks so tired too and unable to handle the crowd despite their hard effort. In fact there are not much food variety over it's price of $40++ (Groupon claimed value much more than that!) which was a TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT!!!I thought at least there would be some oysters to compensate for the disappointment at the cold seafood counter but turn out to be only EXACTLY cold red prawns and mussels!As for the Roasted Wayu Beef as promised in Groupon, it was a bluff!!! No such thing as seen as I looked everywhere from the start till the end of buffet (2.5hrs time). I felt so cheated!There were desserts and 3 flavor ice-creams (vanilla, chocolate & strawberry) but still a total letdown for Mandarin Hotel standard. Better to eat a $20-25 buffet elsewhere.We have stayed in Mandarin Hotels before but this is the first time we have encountered this. Only thing to say, it is really a disappointment. And don't buy from Groupons and really overpriced.I would NOT recommend this place for anyone

I went there for the buffet lunch with a friend of mine. We made reservations about a week in advance but they couldn't seem to find our reservations and not hold back the queue we were given seats I believe for walk-ins which far away from the buffet spread. The restaurant didn't seem ready for their opening at 12pm, we went in at about that time and they were still busy preparing food. Especially the teppanyaki which was the best section of all. The squid and beef was really good. However the chef incharge had nothing ready and only begun to cook when we arrived. What I didn't get was the constant queue for the teppanyaki and yet nothing was done to help the one chef there.The spread was terrible, the seafood on ice was just prawns and mussels and the sashimi consists of ONLY salmon though the board lists 5 different kinds of sashimi that was to be served. The tempura section only had 2 types of tempura which was veg and fish if I'm not wrong. We definitely expected a whole lot more that this. Of course there were the standard salads and desserts stations that were mediocre at best. The nicer sections to us were the pasta section, but we thought it would be nicer if the chef was able to cook pasta aglio style. The roasted duck and Indian food section was great!Overall, the variety was limited and we expected a lot more. The prices charged for this buffet is too expensive (we payed about $82 for 2 person)
