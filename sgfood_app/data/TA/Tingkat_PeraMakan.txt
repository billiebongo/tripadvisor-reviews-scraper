One of the more authentic peranakan eateries in Singapore (and I'm one). Was glad that we tried the food here and loved it! Service staff were friendly as well.

Tingkat Permakan is located off Farrer Park MRT together with work shops and provision shops an unlikely place for a restuarant but it turn out to be a pleasant surprise.The food is very authentic and good.Price is reasonable , set lunch is only $10.

Had a gathering with friends there last Wed. Overall ok except that the set meal for prawn dish a bit disappointed as there is only 1 prawn. Can give more like the set meal for pork & beef.

This is an authentic Peranakan restaurant. It is not the best but has a home cooked taste which I like. Plus, they do not use MSG in their food.
Price is also affordable. A surprise discovery in the middle of nowhere

Very well-priced peranakan food near the Little India area in Singapore. Excellent service, and delicious, fresh cooking. A family favourite!

being able to make a reservation via chope is very good as their phone is engaged most of the time. the food quality is overall average, with the rendang being most popular. starting at $10 a set meal, the price is worth a visit. the pork set meal was below average so not recommended. the fried laksa was a little too dry. invest a little more for $14 set meal and u should be happy with experience. do note it took awhile for the food to arrive like 15-20mins.

We had dinner here TWICE in 4 nights stay. Taste is good and the price is reasonable for a restaurant in Singapore. Both times i had their durian chendol. Some of their desserts like pengat pisang and ambon durian are recommended for a try too.Will recommend to my friends and family and come back again. I hope itâ€™s still as good.

We reserved a table, so there was no waiting time. Staff was friendly and helped us in ordering the food (for 8 people. even the set meal was a little overwhelming due to the choices). The food arrived quite promptly, and while the servings may look small, the set meal was quite filling overall (for moderate eaters). Would recommend for value-for-money Peranakan food

Although they were shorthanded, the food was amazing. Food was served hot and don't get me started on the desserts. Chendol and Durian Chendol are MUST try.

Really value for money. Cosy setting. Will definitely visit again. We ordered the set menu that only cost $15

Simple tingkat concept in a Peranakan restaurant. Excellent Set A, B, C concept to simplify ordering for 2 pax dinner and yet could savor the rest of the menu options in small portion.
5
Love this place to bits. The food is really good and the service staffs are very helpful. Will definitely return again!

More baby seats are required as this is more of a family cafe. Portion can be bigger. Parking was not hard to find and without shelter

Food was delicious but portion was too small. Will visit the restaurant again. The shop was simple. Cannot use credit card

Overjoyed to find out that Peramakan has opened more casual eateries in more accessible parts of the city. The menu here is smaller than their flagship at Keppel Club but the quality is still top notch. In line with a more casual and wallet friendly concept, the focus here is on set meals, which offer excellent value. Will probably be back.

Restaurant offers set menu or ala carte options. A good variety of selection for set menu including chicken, pork, fish, beef, seafood. The set includes a main, 2 sides, a dessert and drink from $10-$14. My personal favourite is babi pontay (pork) and beef rendang. For dessert, I love their gula melaka sago. They sell peranakan kuehs and cakes at the counter too.Service staff are very friendly and food is served quite promptly. Do make reservations to ensure seats during peak dining periods.Location wise, it is a 5 minute walk from the exit D of Farrer Park mrt station. You can shop around nearby city square mall after dinner.Highly recommend

Brought my US friends there to try out the perankan food there was I was impressed with the Peramakan restaurant and the stall at Tangs Orchard basement. Unfortunately we were a little disappointed with the savoury dishes especially the chincalok (fermented small shrimps) omelette which doesn't have chincalok flavour and the otah otah (fish paste with spices) that was baked in a ceramic dish instead of being wrapped in coconut leaves and barbequed over charcoal fire or grilled. Apart from these dishes we also ordered the ayam buah keluak (chicken braised with black nut), rendang, ikan assam pedas (fish cooked in tamarind and chilli), sambal terong (eggplant cooked in chilli paste), ngor hiang (minced pork meat rolls)The pandan cake (pandan is a green leaf that provide a nice fragrant used in cakes or desserts in Asia similar to vanilla used in western recipes), ondeh ondeh (glutinous rice balls coated with desiccated coconut filled with liquid brown palm sugar from Malacca), kuih lapis (layered cake) and durian penyet (the flesh of the durian fruit being smashed).For good savoury dishes, I suggest going to Tangs Orchard or the Peramakan restaurant at Keppel Bay
