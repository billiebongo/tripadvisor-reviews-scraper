The portion was relatively small for the price and the options are not much. The beef bowl was also very salty and left me with dry mouth.
4
Had the unagi bowl and salmon pho. Both tasted good! The ‚Äúpho‚Äù was refreshing and the salmon was nicely cooked. Mushrooms were a nice surprise too. Prices were on the steep side though.
4
Stateland is one of my favourite cafes to go to w friends and family, just because the food is consistently good and the ambience is so cozy and nice!
5
Make reservations before going to secure seatings, as the place has limited seating capacity. Very cosy environment and friendly staff who look out to help clear your plates when you're done and yet not eager to chase you away. Food was interesting and nice!
1
Soggy waffle and the soft serve is falling off.Not worth the price. Service was bad too. My friend and I look like some idiot waiting for the service crews to attend to us when they saw us looking aimlessly into the cafe. Perhaps they might want to put a sign
4
So many choices, not big enough stomach.It was really hard to decide on what to eat as everything looks good.I ended up picking the beef bowl instead. The beef was tender with a hint of pink.The bowl could do with more vegetables and maybe a little less sauce but I have a light palate so it might do for you. All mains come with a free drink so it didn't seem as pricey as it first looked.We also ordered the sweet potato fries (served with mayo) and gyoza (topped with tobiko roe and mayo). Both were pretty good with a nice crunch but then anything deep fried is always good. Would be better if the mayo came on the side
3
I have been to Stateland frequently for coffee and their soft serve but not dinner yet. Each pasta cost more than $20 and did not even fill up half the bowl and it was slathered in too much oil. Will not return for mains though but coffee and dessert is still their forte.
4
The service is fast and good. The main courses were pretty decent. We had the salmon mentaiko pasta and unagi don. The salmon was nicely cooked. The unagi on the other hand probably need a more acquired taste to appreciate. My girlfriend loves their sweet potato fries and she claims it's the best she has ever had. I, on the other hand, didn't quite like them as I don't like sweet potato fries. The best part of the meal was their famous dessert, the mochi donut with soft serve. The donut reminds me of the one I had in Romania - really good! Overall the meal was great but will probably come back only for the mochi donut
3
Was interesting to see unique dishes but flavour was soso. Many things werent available as well and they didnt bother telling us till we pointed to them one by one. Expensive as well and they force you to get a drink by upping the price and ‚Äúincluding‚Äù a drink.
5
Not exactly located near an mrt station, but it's sooooo worth it at I returned immediately the next day for my second fix. First time I went.. I had the hainanese chicken rice risotto and my friend had the herbal duck one.. totally satisfying and the sauce was pretty like the original dishes.. we pretty mich wiped our plates within minutes.. they had pretty unique flavours for soft serve like chrysanthemun tea.. mochi bursts were best enjoyed eating one by yourself rather than cutting it into two to share and watch the choc flow out wastefully
4
Excellent food and ice cream, value for money. They change the ice cream Flavours in weekly basis. Highly recommended to bring friends, family and everybody!
4
They served yummy soft serve! We ate the Taro flavoured soft serve with Earl Grey mochi. Taste great! :) Would love to come back here again to try other flavours.
4
I think this is a hidden gem, with bold flavors in their menu. While there can be some improvements in food (eg duck was a bit tough despite confit), we left the cafe with our tummies filled and comforted.
Will definitely come back again.
5
The food was superb, and the soft serve ice cream was wonderful. However it is a small place and can get noisy at times.
4
My fav is the tiger prawn mentaiko pasta. It has a nice char taste to it. Dessert is nice too, earl grey mochi balls with ice cream. Cosy cafe to visit with friends but you need a reservation!
4
Purpose of Visit: Celebrate friend Birthday
Staff was friendly.
Food was affordable.
Overall experience was great.
5
This is my fifth time back to stateland. What really interest me was the new flavour launched every monthly! Love the ambience, the affordable range price yet good amount of food portion plus a drink! However,since I'm always back for the same mains. I hope to see new varities launched in the menu.
5
Still my favorite cafe that I would recommended to anybody who's new to the cafe scene... The food is always consistent and my fav one of all is Chicken rice risotto . Never fails me . And the cafe vibes in there is so chic & comforting . Highly recommended for anybody who loves good and ambience
4
Tiny tiny cafe/restaurant. My second time here and won't be the last. The cafe is tiny and closes early (around 10pm). Food and drink are of great quality, served quite fast too. The soft serve on mochi doughnut is amazing too but why our neighbour one is much bigger than ours (we were 3 sharing it..) while that guy was having one to himself! LOL. Can be more consistent
3
Good location - easily located on the walk on bali lane. There are 2 levels but seems like the team do not know if they are occupied or not - needed to travel up and down to check every time someone comes in. Causing many movements and noise, maybe it could be easier with CCTV? Was surprised by how good the dish turned out by the description. Really refreshing and different from the normal brunch menu that we are used to. Will be back to try out more of their menu. If they are as advertised using Tiong Hoe coffee beans, will need to say very disappointed that good beans was wasted. Will also appreciate if the staff could be more customer service oriented and friendly especially on a Weekend afternoon
1
Food portion was small and price is not cheap. Considering the location of the caf√©, price for the food is very expensive.
5
Great place to hang out and good food! ordered the duck confit and salmon pho which has a interesting flavour combo but taste really good. Dessert was great too!
4
I had the Hainanese Chicken Rice Risotto. Great fusion of our local favourite dish with risotto. Excellent. However, the cashier can be a bit more friendly.
3
Overall not bad. But my friend's kind of disappointed with the Kimchi Carbonara, it's too creamy. But the Mentaiko Salmon Pasta that I ordered is not bad.
4
Stateland is one of my favourite cafe because they have Interesting, unique fusion dishes that taste good. Love their dessert too
4
Nice dons here for lunch. Comes with free drink. The desserts are the best. Horlicks flavour couldve been a lil stronger
4
loved the soft serve.. i tried the sirap limau bandung soft serve. It was really refreshing and not too sweet. It was served with a mochi/doughnut , which complemented the softserve very well.
5
Ambience was great, though the place was a bit hard to find.
Food was served quickly and they were great! Worth the price paid and servers worked very fast to serve the food and clear empty plates. They were friendly as well!
5
Love this place, even though the space isn't big but the ambience is good. I love the doughnut mochi, especially the salted egg filling. Definitely going back again for my next visit to singapore.If you wanna know more watch my vlog on youtube :(enchannel)#14 SINGAPORE SEPT 2017 PART 1 THE POD CAPSUL
5
My girlfriend and I decided to stop by this cafe, which was a highly recommended by a friend. It sure did not disappoint. The cafe is pretty small and was quite packed on a weekday night. We were very lucky to get seats without making a reservation.The decor was very simplistic but it works. It has a unique feel to it. When we walked in, we saw multiple tables having this amazing looking Belgian waffles topped with soft serve ice cream. That was definitely mouthwatering.We weren't particularly hungry, so we decided to order a side of fried chicken and a main of the beef donburi to share. The beef donburi was probably the best I've had in a long while. It was so good, I wished I did not have to share it. They were out of Belgian waffles at that time but we will definitely be be back for that
5
Nice cosy restaurant with unique food. The salmon pasta is good and truffle fries was nicely done...
4
If you are looking for a Atas atmosphere, stateland is for you! The food served are kinda like fusion food and are delicious! Though not all food serve were equally good, the money spend there is somewhat worth it!
4
Good food good company and good service rendered. Their thai green milk tea softserve is good and refreshing! Loving it üòã
4
Great place for catching up with friends, but kinda squeezy and narrow. Second level can be quite warm
4
Ordered several sides and desserts for sharing among the group and we enjoyed the mentaiko dumplings & chicken on waffles. The mochi donut was really special and delicious too! Service was great and we had an enjoyable time at the cafe. Will be back again!
2
Just like the title, I loved the ambience and the food. But the cockroach really turned it into a bad experience for me.
4
Very good mentaiko pasta and awesome desserts. Packed with rich flavours and friendly service staff :)
4
Ordered the salmon pho, mentaiko prawn and coconut water soft serve with salted egg mochi.. the salmon pho is quite blend but the salmon is well cooked.. the mentaiko sauce mix well with the pasta except that the prawn used are not fresh prawns (frozen one).. the soft serve ice cream is smooth and not too sweet..The service can be improved.
4
Stateland Caf√© serves really good Asian-fusion cuisine with delicious desserts. The dinner set meal is quite value-for-money‚Äî the mentaiko tiger prawn pasta came with lots of prawns & same for the beef donburi. Did not expect the food to be so good as we came for the dessert. We also ordered the mochi doughnut with thai green tea soft serve. The soft serve is pretty watered down but the doughnut is one of the best dessert we have ever tried. Will definitely be back again
4
Stateland cafe is located in the same building with Brother Bird. We had their truffle fries on the side in a generous portion. On the other hand, we had their waffle fried chicken that comes with a free drink, no doubt I chose their cappuccino. Must say that they have pretty good coffee too! The fried chicken also comes in generous portion, really crispy, topped with korean style barbeque sauce. The set costs $18 which I think is a pretty good deal
5
food quality is very high rated.i have order a salmon mentaiko noodles.the fish has been nicely cooked according to the description on the menu.
i will definitely be back again to try other items on the menu.
5
Cosy cafe with nice fusion food especially the desserts! Atmosphere and interior of cafe is unique too!
5
Pretty and appetizing plating, food was good. Green Curry donburi needs improvement, a tad too dry. Desserts is the best selling point.
4
Though the shop is small, I felt cosy and the food was served very quickly after ordering. But it was kinda warm inside the shop making the overall stay not so pleasant afterall.
3
The corner seat we had was too warm. Cannot feel the air con at all. Suggest the owner to look into it. Nice place afterall.
4
We heard of good reviews and wanted to try smthg new. I had the mentaiko salmon pasta and I love it! My friends liked their kimchi cabonara and salmon pho. Waffles imo was soso. Cafe is just opp parkview square, will definately visit again
4
What make it cute is the poop shape soft serve but it taste so yummy & soft. Love their mochi donut texture, chewy & not as oily as other donut. The soft serve goes well with the mochi donut.
4
There was a queue when we arrived, so it was a good thing we made a book through Chope. We sailed past the line and had a table waiting for us. My girlfriend and I shared an ice cream waffle with caramelised bananas, which was absolutely delicious. I feel that the ice cream flavours were too limited though; we were only given a choice between Earl Grey and Taro ice cream. It's good for adventurous people like my girlfriend, but disappointing for people like me, who prefer consistency and "safe", reliable flavours like chocolate and vanilla. The atmosphere was also very pleasant and the staff were friendly and helpful. Definitely a place for hipsters as there are hardly any mainstream items (at least for the desserts)
5
It was such a wonderful meal with my bff! We starved ourselves for a good meal at STATELAND Cafe because everything looks so food on Instagram! Indeed, we are extremely satisfied with the meal and we were surprised that the mains come with a complimentary drink! Will definitely visit stateland cafe again! Thank you! :
4
The 2 mains we ordered were very delicious.As for the mochi doughnut with black sesame softserve (flavour for that week), was simply divine! It way surpassed our expectation. Very worth the $ and calories!We were seated on the 2nd floor and the surrounding was good and not too noisy
5
Love their mentaiko pasta and mochi doughnut + soft serve in cookie butter flavour. This dessert is a must order each time we visit e cafe.
3
Lychee Tea was diluted.
Waffles abit burnt & rather bland.
Offer more options for fried rather than run out of mill Truffles & Nachos.
Need improvement for return customers given so many cafes around.
3
Been seated at the second floor and there is no waiters serving at that floor. Long waiting for the food to be served. Waiter sent the wrong food to our table.
5
Their menu prices are nett! It is an awesome dining place for group gathering. Great ambience with nice food.
5
After seeing multiple posts on their dishes, getting to try them out is amazing. Love the Hainanese Risotto. Thanks to the server for the recommendation.
4
Had a great time with my friends, however we waited very long about 1 hour for my dish to arrive (Chicken rice risotto). Was delicious though!
4
love their soft serve. their new flavour tokyo banana is fantastic, it tasted like frozen banana milk.
5
Met the owners of the places, young entrepreneur with the love of food, coffee & everything nice. Lively place and good for casual dates or just to sit and watch the world pass on a weekend.
Will be back for sure!
4
atmosphere of restaurant was fairly cosy and warm, staff greets upon guest arrival and food presentation and quality was good.
5
Main course is surprisingly delicious! Mentaiko King prawn is a must try as the prawns are really fresh. Serving is pretty small but i guess that leaves more space for the dessert. No service charge and most attractive of all is every main course cones with a free drink of choice.
5
Staffs are very friendly and approachable. Food is of unique fusion. hanianese chicken rice is a must-try üëç
5
Great food and drinks, we love the truffle fries. Mains come with a drink, which is good value. Atmosphere is nice and cozy to chill.
5
A small and cosy cafe at Bali lane that serves fusion of tasty food! Has the beef with rice and it was very flavorful - great place to hang with the mates for brunch. Love the no GST and service charge!!
5
Their dishes are really tantalising, capturing the best essence of quality food and affordability. Highly recommended for food adventurers!
3
Visited on a Sunday evening and more than half the menu was out of stock. Only 4 dishes, coffee and 2 sodas to choose from. While the food served was tasty, it's quite disappointing to have so little to choose from.
4
Had the set lunch (salmon noodles) and snores waffles which were excellent! However, the noodles portion was rather small.
4
Huge slab of salmon with generous ebikko (roe) on top. The salmon was cooked perfectly - soft, flaky and still slightly pink in the centre.
4
Wow. they definitely put a lot of thought into creating their menu. loved the chicken rice risotto. flavours were spot on though it hurt a bit forking out 20 bucks for something that'll cost a quarter few streets down
1
Made a reservation via chope for 2 to dine, we arrived on time and walked into Stateland. Nobody bothered to attend to us or showed us to our table. The staff simply "instructed" us from the cashier booth to place our order at the cashier once we are ready. Despite having 2 inverter aircons at the first floor, it was very very stuffy. A lot of things on the menu were not available. We wanted to try the chicken rice risotto, which was not available. As such we decided to just order one main - Tender Beef Bowl. One word to describe the beef - TOUGH. Worse than some of the Japanese bento rice available at food court. Definitely not going back to this cafe again.
5
Several time visiting Singapore it was my first time come to this place and i was there with some local friends and honestly they bring me to a good place for having dessert :) So we ordered a huge Red velvet waffle and some vanilla ice cream on top. the ambiance of this place also nice, such a great place ti chat with some friends while enjoying your dessert
3
I had the hainanese risotto, it was not bad. But drink - lemonade was normal. Staff was attentive, giving us another refill of water without initiating.
5
nice food and ambiance. price was alittle costly but worth the money. the pasta is a must to try and not forgetting the waffles .soft and crispy enough
4
Tried the braised beef cheek risotto and hainanese chicken rice risotto and both were great. The complimentary drinks were meh though.
4
Went there for the first time to try their food. The black tiger prawn aglio olio was nice ! Loved the ambience too ! Will definitely go back again ! Really appreciate the service as well. Keep it up!
3
Service wasn't that good. Had to wait for an hour for the food like truffle fries and pasta. Can't really feel the aircon in the cafe
2
Was warm when we were seated upstairs. Tried beer risotto which was just salty, kimchi pasta was not kimchi enough. The only nice food was mentaiko gyoza. Lemonades are so so.
4
The main course are average but the dessert is worth the hype. The place is really cozy and atmosphere was good. Will come back again for their desserts!
4
The mentaiko aglio olio and cafe latte were great. The latter was wonderfully smooth. My dining companions enjoyed the hazelnut praline thick toast too. I preferred the fried mochi desert but not the winter melon flavour soft serve. It's a nice meal and I would go again to try other items
3
Cozy setting with great ambience. Interesting fusion food they had. I've ordered mentaiko prawn pasta, the taste was great but if you had a little too much, it gets a bit gelat. Truffle fries were a little over done, could be better. Overall, presentation of the food and setting of the restaurant was good, could do better in taste! Good effort everyone!
3
Despite having reservation, still waited up to 30mins, and I went at the post dinner period. In the end got allocated to the outdoor seat.. after we placed our orders we waited for another 30mins.. the food was good though, but I don't think I will be going back again.Truffle fries was awesome but really salty which I didn't mind.
4
Food portion was good but several choices were unavailable. But overall had a good dining experience there
3
The ambience was good but the lamp was too Low hence it was too glaring for the eyes. Food was okay.
4
The portion of food is just nice. We had the mentaiko tiger prawn pasta and Senkaku beef donburi. Food was good and comes with complimentary drinks. Although the cafe was a little cramped, the ambience is pretty nice.
2
Good food, good atmosphere/decor, friendly staff but pretty mediocre coffee and dirty toilets. We wouldn't have minded but it was very expensive, which was my main criticism of the whole meal
2
We had the Tiger Prawn, Mentaiko pasta - it's $20 and we could choose a drink to go along with it. (Drink is free of charge.) It tasted ok but it was honestly quite oily! We also ordered the Truffle Fries which was a disappointment! The fries were not fried well and they were drenched/soaked in stale oil. The worst part of our lunch there was the glass they used for our drinks... the one which I drank from had huge crack lines and the bottom and as I was having Iced Tea, I could only see it when I had finished my tea. I don't think it's nice nor safe to continue using such a damaged glass
4
Food was good! Had the beef cheek risotto and it was really tasty.The mentaiko gyoza was my fave though! The sauce was so yummy!Ordered the salmon noodles but didnt think tt i was that awesome.The winter melon soft serve with mochi was really good. The winter melon taste was a nice touch.Alot of things were sold out though! Sadly! Wanted to try the kimchi cabonara and the fried chicken w waffle but they were out of stock! :
4
Went for a brunch with some friends and we randomly chose this cafe in Bali Lane. The lemonade was really good and refreshing. But the star of the day was the hand cut truffle fries. It was crispy on the inside and fluffy in the inside topped with some cheese and dip into the Mayo. It was heaven! Ordered some soft serve with mochi. Gotta say it is rather an odd combination and it didn't help that it came in a rather ermm inappropriate plating. But the watermelon soft serve was refreshing. Other than that, nothing to shout about. Also, the cafe is really small hence it being rather stuffy.
3
Actually this place is two in one restaurant Brother Bird had moved in here. I ordered watermelon Soft Serve ice cream yesterday. It just like a eating watermelon. I felt so fresh after walk under the sun for a few mins to looking for this place. Bottom of cup had fresh cut of strawberries too. Macarons was also good. Ambience was nice. Love the decorations. The service was not attentive.. No service charge here though. I would return to try other flavor of soft serve in the future.
4
An instant uplift after the trip to Raffles Hospital - their service is quick! Ordered the iced chocolate mint (so-so), truffle Alfredo (yummy in my tummy), liusha bursts (the best experience of donuts and soft serve - though earl grey burst and matcha burst were sold out already) and red velvet waffle (too much to have in one go even for two people). But a good place for dessert but options are waffles and bursts mainly. But please note - cash and NETS only
3
Came here for a coffee today after having brunch in the area. Chose this place as it is one of the few cafes with air conditioning. The coffee was ok but not exceptional. Service was a bit on the slow side, although the staff were friendly enough
4
Tried the red velvet waffle over there. It was good. Will be back for more and try the toast. Went in the evening after work, not much people there, it's a good place to relax and enjoy your dessert. Friendly staff.
5
Very good food, very nice and casual environment with attentive staff.
I love the pasta and honey toast personally, the honey toast is easily one of the best in singapore.
3
Tried their mentaiko aglio olio and red velvet waffles. Kind of underwhelming. Spaghetti was too oily but al dente. Waffle and cream cheese frosting didn't have much taste. No idea go come everyone else's photos have tobikko on top but mine didn't have any. Cute cat loitering around, nice ambience and staff are prompt in providing you service. They serve ice water too
4
In Summary:Was there for dessert and initially thought that the cafe has closed down. Apparently this particular branch is renamed/collaborating/bought over (not sure which) Brother Bird and they do serve an interesting soft serve dessert that looks incredibly instagrammable, if that is your thing. Taste-wise, it is worth a try with its unique blend of flavours to choose from. Good place for a group with an adventurous spirit
3
I came here for the waffles because it was a little raved that the waffles here were amazing, especially the red velvet waffles, but I thought they were a little over rated. The plating seems a little clumsy with many components like the meringue, cream cheese, raspberries and ice cream. Meringue was extra and not needed and didn't taste nice, cream cheese was too little, waffles too crispy. The price was a little steep for this quality of waffles. The brunch looks really unique, maybe it's worth a try. The place has really limited seating and it wasn't very comfortable either
4
Spent some time walking around Little India and was making our way back to our hotel via Arab Street and was looking for a coffee to keep us going. We accidentally found this quaint little place with unique decor and friendly and attentive staff. The menu wasn't extensive but the eggs laksa benedict and the red velvet waffle (for my wife) went down a treat. Well presented and tasty. Nice little touch of a bottle of cold water plus very decent coffees too
4
Nice and quiet place. Personally, I do not fancy the red velvet waffle despite the recommendations from my friends. In general, the cafe is a great place to chill with a few mates. Food is great too! At least the ones that I've tried :) Staff are pretty friendly as well
3
good flat white, good red velvet waffle and most of all friendly service from the guy stationed on level 2. One man show to look after the entire level 2. Friendly and attentive. probably need 2 person on top when full house, he just cant handle everything on his own
3
Food: Cafe-style menu with all day breakfast and heaps of sweet options including an assortment of waffles and honey toast. I did not enjoy my eggs Benedict, as the combination of the tomato chilli jam and hollandaise, in my opinion, was an odd pairing.Must Try: Being known for their waffles, you can give it a try. We didn‚Äôt particularly like our red velvet version because we found it too sweet. The classic version with ice cream is a safe bet.Environment and Service: I love the vintage-industrial theme of the cafe. The cafe is small with limited seating, so come early to avoid standing outside for a table. You order and pay at the counter so there is not a lot of service involved.Price: Decent prices ‚Äì approximately $18-20 per person

Sorry guys I'm not being harsh on them but just being brutally honest. I hope they take my comments constructively and sort things out. Firstly the caf√© is not designed ergonomically. I see that they have mostly tables for two with a mixture of stools and chairs for seat. With a long waiting time to get a table (we waited fifty minutes) and for the food to be served, it's definitely uncomfortable to sit on a stool. They can optimise the seating capacity by putting up long benches instead of tables which are sandwiched so tightly that it's hard to move around without disturbing the people beside or behind you. If privacy was their concern for putting up tables instead of benches then I can assure them there wasn't any. All the patrons were just an elbow away!I'm pretty amused by the fact that an all day breakfast caf√© ran out of eggs on a Sunday. Need to work on their logistics management. We had a red velvet waffle and a s'mores waffle and they arrived 35 minutes later. The waffle was overdone. The cream cheese was drizzled all over the waffle with chocolate shavings and a scoop of ice cream on top. The s'mores had marshmallows on top with digestive biscuits. Both weren't palate pleasing! My pregnant wife was craving for waffles hence, I brought her here and definitely she didn't get her cravings satisfied. They lack in micro management. You have to place your orders at the counter which is at the end of the seating area and take your cutleries and water from a shelf near the entrance. These weren't told to us when they gave out the menu. They ran out of forks and glasses and need to be told to replenish them even though they're were walking down the aisle numerous times, receiving the people and serving food.Please get a "closed" sign and put it at the entrance after you have taken the last order for the day. I counted more than ten people who walked in just to be told that the shop is closed! I seriously hope the below par waffles and poor services weren't a product of lacklustre attitude as we came in to dine towards their closing time. The staff was polite though. I know this outlet is just two months old and being managed by young people in their twenties and I can overlook the flaws for now but I seriously hope they sort out their issues as soon as possible
