Review by Dr Sim. Good variety of food. Noisy and sweaty ambience. No Air-conditioning. Many of the stalls served good food. Poy Kee Yong Tau Foo and 100 Year Yong Tau Hu are very good. Tourists should visit. Near MRT. Regards Dr Sim

I waited for 30mins just to get a taste of this infamous Hakka Yong Tau Foo (YTF) by Poy Kee Store #01-1066 @ People’s Park Complex Food Center. Well, personally I think it tastes alright, nothing spectacular, as I’m unsure if YTF ingredients are genuinely homemade. It includes fish ball, soft beancurd stuffed with fish paste (Fried & non-fried), and Fried Tau Ki. Total 7 pieces + a bowl of noodles garnished with Fried Anchovies & Pak Choi, YTF sauce & chilli sauce etc. Option of thin noodles or flat white rice noodles; dry or soup available @ sgd3.50 for a small portion, sgd4.50 medium & large sgd5.50. As for food hygiene level, it’s graded B. However, I noticed old uncle taking order, collecting money & replenishing noodles WITHOUT wearing gloves! Most importantly, his hair is absolutely greasy - it seemed unwashed for days! Nevertheless, I’m a realist too, as I can’t expect much for a mere sgd3.50 @ Hawker Center. It’s for the experience.. once is good enough!

The food court here is open air and has a wide selection of traditional local food. You can find noodles, roast meat, dumplings, yong tau fu, dim sum, pastries and many more. There is a section where there are lots of stores serving mainland China cuisine.Lots of choices of local food at a very reasoanble price
4
For me the fact locals eat here, is an indication of how good the food court in the People's Park Centre is. Still good quality and good value. An excellent place to get a cheap and filling meal for just a few dollars. Plenty of food options, with lots of stalls offering a variety of dishes. We always eat here at least once when visiting Singapore and recommend others to do so too
5
People’s Park Centre hawker centre is the biggest food court I know in Singapore. Food choices are wide and a meal is cheap as it can cost below S$5. I had Penang style noodles and ice kacang, which were both very tasty. This food court is rather frequented by locals like residents of the neighbourhood, so this definitely not tourist focussed place, which also isn’t on many tourists’ agenda, is an enjoyable option to experience Singapore’s daily life. Great! Highly recommended!!
5
This is where local people go and there is a reason why, food is great and cheap.Here you will find the best Laksa! Great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner.The pharmacy and herbal shop on the 2nd floor has a good selection of herbs and ointments, it's also the cheapest in the area
5
It is so old-school, it's good! If you are not into glitz and glitter, this old-school shopping centre is simple and warm, and easily navigable. The shopkeepers are robust and down to earth, and if you are into the bargaining, this is the place for some civilised bargaining action
5
I loved my 3 hours browsing the floors at Peoples Park Centre. The 3 floors have a great vibe, not at all like VIVO city for instance. This is an everyday Singaporeans shopping precinct and the lack of crowds made it even more enjoyable for me. Fully air conditioned, with lifts and escalators.There are not many tourists here, especially in the food hall downstairs, so don't be surprized if you get some interested looks from the locals. Everything is very reasonably priced. There are many travel agencies, hairdressers, Chinese medicine/herbalists, massage shops, beauticians and my favourite: 2 excellent craft/material shops.I will definitely be back again on the next visit to Singapore
5
First timers in Singapore appreciated so much the ambiance of the People's Park Centre. The spacious centre allows tourists to move around. It is good for aged persons too.
3
nothing much to see, its just a normal shopping mall with very crowded people, but perfumes are quire cheap
3
This place is full of locals and very few tourists if your after authentic food at cheap prices with no bells and whistles this place is well worth a try.
4
its easy to find good food in reasonable price, location is strategic , have mrt, bus and taxi, many shopping center and shop in reasonable price.
3
It a food paradise. However, its often crowded and busy with people. A must visit place for sure if in singapore.
4
An old place in Chinatown to eat dood food on budget, to shop or just to hang around and watch the people. We had chicken rice for S$ 2.50 per portion
4
Visited here this morning looking for phone options. So many choices.
Really enjoyed a quick snack for a late breakfast from the Ya Kun Kaya Toast.
Two poached eggs, coffee and four slices of sugar toast for $4.80...unbelievable value.
Go for a look.
5
Locals know this place is the shopping place where there are cheaper prices for goods compared to the touristy places along Orchard road. You can bargain prices at the small stores but not at the department store. Hope your bargaining skills are good as locals love to bargain. That's how they talk to you
4
Good value local food. Plenty of choice to suit all tastes. Well worth a visit and joining a queue to sample freshly cooked food, available to go or sit and eat in the midst of all the action. Try the freshly squeezed juices to clean your palate
5
We stayed in Singapore for 7 days and ate here most days (sometimes 3 times a day!). We didn't have a bad meal. Prices are very reasonable from 2.50SGD up to around 8-9SGD for a meal. All varieties available from traditional Singaporean cuisine, Chinese, Thai, Indian, Malay. Choose your food type, pick your stall, place your order then find a seat. Most are self-service so you order and wait then find a seat but a few take your order and your table number and will deliver your food when ready. Drinks are usually available from dedicated stalls selling only drinks.Open 7 days a week - although some stalls might have different opening times
4
If you looking to eat in a budget as well as have good food the food court is very reasonable food is good and fresh. Enjoyed my chicken rice very much.
3
This is a busy place, lots of shops with a variety of products, mostly cheap (and some nasty!). Food court is not the cleanest place but we braved some lunch which was tasty and cheap. Service was average and not friendly but fast.
4
Very popular with the middle-aged/eldrrly locals and foreigners, there is plenty of low-priced shopping that can be done here. Also check out Lepark, a unique "rooftop" bar and live music hangout.
3
Lots of food with all types of variety. Mostly local crowd here but still very nice ambiance. Only and main drawback, the place is dark and pretty dirty!!!
4
It's quite ghetto - the floors aren't clean, there's no grand entrance, and stalls' equipment spills out onto the closest tables. But there is a great variety of cheap and great food, mostly Chinese but some Singaporean/Malaysian, too. It feels much more authentic and local than Maxwell and Lau Pa Sat
4
Here you will find lots of 2nd hand and new mobiles, electronic gadgets, cameras, clothes, bags, footwears, accessories and of course food. This is one of the older Singapore Malls accessible by taxi, busses, MRT (Chinatown), private cars with ample parking in the building. Lots of bargainable buys here. With a little haggle you might find the price is right
3
Don't expect friendly seller here. The place is very crowded. The food is good and worth the cheap price. But the place is a bit dirty, and especially smelly near the toilet. There is a bazaar just behind this place for a good look around though
5
This quaint place is located close to the hotel we were staying in. Came across it by chance and ended up eating all our meals there. Wonderful BBQ Smoked Duck, pork ribs, prawns etc at ridiculously low prices. Try the fried Carrot Cake - nothing like carrot cake as we know it, but delicious anyway. You can have it in black or white versions. We were the only non Asians eating there and didn't see many others at any time in the complex.Apart from the food there are stacks of Travel Agents, Beauty Salons, Money Changers, and a fabulous bead and fabric shop which has an incredible array of sewing and craft supplies.A wonderful lady, Alice Tan at #B1-48 People's Park Centre does foot reflexology. We both had a treatment and our feet are still feeling the benefits from her magic touch! $18 for a good half hour of treatment. Wish I could have this treatment every week

i love to o eat behind this building... they have a place like a food court with so many option of delicious food... and they serve me with giant portion... something that i never get in indonesia .. lol. sichuan and beef soup vermicellie here is authentic

We have experienced bad services from cleaners during many occasions.Today lunch visit is the worst experience.The local Chinese short built male cleaner snatching our tray of utensils before we have complete our meal. When I gently push my tray nearer to him, he scolded me in Hokkien. When I commented on his attitude, he asked me to go ahead to complain.I always respect service providers, be it a local cleaner or a Bangladesh. I will eat with care, making sure that I do not dirty the table, picking up the bones(if there is any), stacking up the utensils to ease the cleaner job. Why can't they serve us with respect too?Perhaps the government should allow more foreign workers in cleaning industry since our locals have no passion in the job!
4
Lots and lots of choices,mainly chinese food,but really,they are very lively! My fave snacka are fishballs in curry, somekind of chinese style pizza, just go there,it is worth your time
3
After 20 over years not much has changed but the food are plentiful and economical . So much variety and the service providers are really working hard to give this place so much vibrancy
4
Hubby had his glasses made here. Very happy with them. Shop around before you buy as we have found cheaper prices elsewhere! Good shopping overall!
4
A good fare of Chineese food and drink was available here - there were alternative cuisines available too - Mc Donald's etc. One could buy local fresh fruit from a stall outside. Reasonably priced food stalls all sorts of fish prawns, crabs cooked to your liking. There are overhead electric fans so do try and sit under a fan! There was a beef only stall, beef cooked in a number of ways - quite tasty. Worth a visi
5
An amazing collection of stalls covering most Singaporean cuisines all having their own take in particular gastronomical delights......the prices are ridiculously low. The fun is looking, both knowing for some what they are as the menu is not in english, but still giving them a try.....this is real food at its best, most over...not ...bugger off MasterChef and the rest if those precocious cooking shows...try real everyday food here

This mall is sometimes mistaken with another nearby mall, People's Park Complex as their names are pretty close. This is quite an old mall. There are many travel agencies, shops selling Chinese goods, money changers, opticians, food courts in basement,etc.The food here is typical food court standards ie expensive & run of the mill types. If you want to eat really good 'local' foods & yet pay 'local' prices (even for beers), then head down to the nearby huge Chinatown Complex food centre.Go down to the MRT station via the escalator just outside this mall. Look for Exit A Pagoda Street. Take the escalator up to Pagoda Street & you are right in the heart of Chinatown - the street markets where you can get cheap & huge range of souvenirs, etc.Once up here , turn right & walk through next 2 streets ie Temple Street & then Smith Street.Here you can see Chinatown Complex building. The huge local food centre is on Smith street- 2nd floor. There are many small nice shops on 1st floor. See my review on Chinatown Complex ( on the food centre review).Do not mistake this 2nd floor food centre for another 'Food Street' on the same stretch of other end of Smith Street. Its very "different."Enjoy the authentic great local food! At cheap or reasonable prices! Not uncommon to see tourists do come here regularly. "Eat where the locals eat & you get the best food; at local prices.

To avoid confusion, although Peoples Park is a more down-market shopping mall on several storeys, this section of TA is under ‘restaurants’ and therefore it is for reviews of the hawker food centre and not the shops or shopping mall.The hawker food centre is at ground level and you do not have to go through the shopping area to find it as there are two entrances on Upper Cross Street, albeit virtually next door to each other and narrow, so easy to miss. However, once inside the food area is large, and as has already been noted, in two sections alongside each other so it is possible to miss one of the openings to the other section. Although close to Chinatown, it is the ‘wrong side’ of the main New Bridge Road and thus gets very little by way of the Chinatown tourist trade. Therefore if you want to experience a down-to-earth local atmosphere with very few tourists then you might give it a go. However, it is totally enclosed and therefore hot and stuffy (I agree with one reviewer who described it as rather like being in an underground car park), and in my view the food is not as good as other hawker’s centres, although undeniably very cheap. For me there are better hawker’s food centres, although I find this one convenient for a quick and cheap lunch as it’s handy for the many buses that stop just up the road outside

The People's Park Center, which shall not be confused with the People's Park Complex, is a Chinese shopping mall based in Chinatown (Metro station Chinatown), selling the typical Chinese goods, beauty treatments, electronics, clothes and of course Chinese street food, which we didn't try because it looked and smelled oddDo not expect this shopping mall to be as tidy and clean as the Marina Square or Takashimaya, because we are light years from that, but it is still fun to see something different from those cloned shopping malls, even if you end up buying nothing, like me
4
This is a great place if you want to eat where the locals eat, its like an underground carpark with tables and seats and along each side there are these little cookeries which are about 6ft x 6ft, and the food is cooked fresh, you can buy drinks there, beer, tea, coffee, soft drink. If you are not scared of the look of the place and mix with everyone, this is the place for you, we were recommended by a local to go there and enjoyed it so much!!!

To get to the People’s Park Food Center, you can go through the Shopping Complex which is what we did. I am sure there is another way to get there by bypassing the shopping, but this was our first time hear.The food complex is rather large but is sort of split into two sections. Without a bit of exploring we would have missed an entire section of food stalls which would have been a shame. There must be over 200 food stalls here.We got some chicken and rice (~$2) which was moist and tender. The rice wasn’t too flavorful, but the chili did add a little bit of heat.My wife got a noodle dish with salted fish and bok choy. I’m not a big fan of that so I didn’t have a bite. The line was probably 10 people long but it went quickly. My wife thought it was just okay, nothing special to justify the line.We also got a soup (~$3) with fishballs, tofu, fried tofu and a chicken wing. The soup was somewhat bland, but otherwise okay.The roasted duck and BBQ pork (~$6) which was very good. The skin was crisp and sweet with a nice lacquered finish, while the meat was tender on the duck. The pork was the right amount of tender meat and fatty goodness.We tried an Indonesian place and got Nasi Bungkus (~$3), which did not come wrapped in a banana leaf like its usually served.The food had been sitting out for a while and was somewhat cold. You are normally served a hard boiled egg instead of a fried egg. The fish cake was okay, but the chicken wings were again cold. I should have let the fact that I didn’t see one person buy any food for the 10 minutes I was waiting for my duck/pork dish be a sign of bad to mediocre food.There are many options at People’s Park Food Center, and most of them are very reasonably priced. If in the area again, I would definitely try out more of the food stalls and try to be more strategic about it
