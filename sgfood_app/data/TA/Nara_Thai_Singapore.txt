Decent food. Good variety. Service was attentive and people seem to be enjoying both the food and their conversation.

Crowded and popular everyday

Food is good. Service also good. However, On average we spend $40 per pax.. would prefer to go for a buffet dinner for the amount of food we have.
4
After a dip in quality of food and service, Nara seems to have rebounced, although it is much less full than when it first opened. It distinguishes itself for having unusual dishes rarely found elsewhere. Pricey for its shopping mall location next to a Korean army stew eatery

I have always been visiting this restaurant everytime I visit Singapore. The restaurant is not a big one but yet very cosy and hospitable. The staff very courteous and the service very prompt. The menu is not very elaborate however they mostly have the Thai specialities like Pad Thai, Tom Yum etc. However this time was told they stopped preparing Tom Kha soup which was one of my favourites. Starters are good and portions are generous. A must visit for all
4
Went to Nara in Singapore a few times and in Thailand. Standards pretty much consistent.first time visit for my friend. Curry crab is a must , followed by Tom Yum Soup. Friend asked for river prawn to be de shelled, but was not able to accede to her request. Otah in coconut was interesting with a good amount of seafood in it. however we felt thirsty after the meal. Could be due to the MSG used, Nevertheless, it was a tasty dinner

Located in a corner of Ion, is Nara Thai, it looks lovely from outside very pretty and modern looking place. The menu has a lot of classic thai dishes. Expect quality and smaller portions best for sharing.We tried their blue rice, tom yum prawn soup, garlic pork and a dessert with iced lemon grass tea. Every dish was very well done, tasty, fresh and authentic tasting although the portions are small. Definitely a nice place for two people to catch up in the afternoon or for a lunch or dinner if you are okay with higher prices and modest portions

Never experience a restaurant where the service is the worst of the worst I ever encountered. A waiter took my order. I ordered starter platter which consists of fish cake, pork satay and pandan chicken. Shortly after, the waiter came and told me the pork satay is not available and asked me if I could change to deep fried chicken. I told him that there is already panda chicken so it didn't make sense to have 2 chicken dishes. He offered me to change to prawn cake which I agreed.A few minutes later, another guy came and introduced himself as the restaurant manager. He told me that I have to top up $4/piece for the prawn cake. I reasoned with him that the pork satay is $14 whereas the prawn cake is $12. So I am exchanging a more expensive starter for a cheaper items, so it is unreasonable for the restaurant to ask me to top-up. Then the manager insisted that I can change for fried chicken ($9!!!). I explained to him that it couldn't make sense to have 2 chicken dishes (pandan chicken & fried chicken) for my platter of 3 starters. The manager then suggested I opted for the one piece of Pork Meat Ball ($12). I asked him why only exchange for one pork ball and not 2 since the items are a lot cheaper. He told me this is HIS decision. Otherwise the other option is to take fried chicken. I agreed to ONE pork ball in exchange for Pork satay.Shortly, the manager returned. He informed me that the Head Chef refused to change to Pork Ball and there is NO OPTION for me. Only fried chicken. I asked to see the Head Chef.The Head Chef came. He told me his decision is final. Take it or leave it - no sense of apologetic at all. I told him the restaurant should not have accepted my order in the first place if pork satay is sold out. But since your waiter took my order and MORE IMPORTANTLY your waiter suggested I could change to prawn cake and then the restaurant MANAGER agreed I could change to Pork Meat Ball. Why your restaurant could not HONOUR your words. The head chef was NOT APOLOGETIC AT ALL. He said this is my decision, take it or cancel the order.I have never seen restaurant with SUCH ATTITUDE. It is the attitude of the head chef that really pissed me off. As a senior management, they should honor what their staff had agreed to (firstly was prawn cake and then downgraded to ONE meat ball).From the beginning, i never created the problem. They took my order and later "discussed" whether they could exchange the dish for something MUCH CHEAPER. The restaurant didn't even consider the customer feeling. Why should there be 2 chicken starters and of similar taste!!

Golden mile standard isn't quite the old ways and ain't as cheap either. For better service and quality, Nara is the place to go to.
2
Good atmosphere inside the restaurant. However the food was not value for money. Just one small rice portion red curry i bought was 30 sin dollars.
Have much btr places to have dinner in singa.
5
Tom Yum Soup was spicy and good. Love the pork skewers too!
We ordered a variety of dishes good for sharing, and introduced the famous "blue rice" to our visitors. They enjoyed the dinner very much.
5
My first time here and experience was great. Comparable with food quality in Thailand. Would visit again

Having been to Nara before, I thought it's worth a second visit. Therefore I proudly introduced my friend who just returned from overseas to this restaurant. The Pomelo Salad is still great but the Tom Yung Kung (Tiger prawns in spicy lemon grass and lime soup) is not spicy enough this time! Definitely not up to par with those I have tried elsewhere. The Kao Phad Sapparod (Pineapple Fried Rice) is not fragrant and the Tord Mun Kung (Deep Fried Shrimp Cakes) which I think is one of their speciality is nothing to shout about. As my friend was unwilling to pay 50c for a glass of water, we ordered a glass of hot lemongrass to share. For $6.50 a glass, the lemongrass fragrance is definitely lacking and I felt that they shouldn't stinge on the amount of lemongrass they used! Sure they have an extensive menu and I haven't tried all their stuff, so I can't say this restaurant is not worth visiting again! Service is not too bad as usual. Ambience is rather good and it's wheelchair friendly

Ordered the salted egg papaya salad, turned out very very salty and I couldn't even finish half of it. When my main was dished up, I was shocked as it turned out that my crab appeared to be drowning in the pool of yellow curry. It was completely different from the picture on the menu. I even double checked with the waiter prior to ordering and was assured that it's only a spoonful of curry as sauce. The chef overdid it and was again too salty. Can't finish. My mango sticky rice did not work for me, despited waited for 20 mins! The dessert was weird as the mango was too sourish and not the typical sweet aromatic mango you normal take in Thai restaurant! Another dish that was left unfinished! I've been to Nara in Bangkok and was very impressed. Can't say the same for this particular branch! Customer service was also bad here. Will not recommend and will not be back. I should have taken heed of the reviews on facebook

@TheKuoKnowsNara Thai is a good place for a quick lunchtime meal. The food is authentic, the service is efficient and the staff are attentive.The Red Chicken Curry was tasty, though it could have been a little spicier. Interestingly, the Green Mango Salad with Prawns provided all the kick one could possibly need.The Fish Cakes stole the show. Full of flavour and packed with texture. The restaurant also does some good value-for-money lunches. It looks perfect for a person dining alone

To be fair, politely escorted to our table we were told our meal would take 20-40 min in a relatively empty restaurant. We should have considered a little longer. But it crossed my mind the dishes must be all freshly prepared. But alas that was not quite the case for the curry. We ordered Thai prawn green curry and a Thai prawn omelette. The waiter intuitively suggested "of-course" you would like a less oily omelette? Thankfully he was correct I appreciated the reminder. The green curry arrived first of all ( but not soon). It was cold! We tried to no avail for some time to get somebody's attention. Eventually we were able to find a waitress who did not understand that our meal was cold until another waitress translated the issue. At that point both waitresses shrugged their shoulders turn their backs and walked away! Sometime later we again managed to attract another waiter and this time asked for the manager. The manager didn't come. Eventually an acting manager came ie the headwaiter. The curry was taken away to be reheated. Time passed by In the meantime my omelette had finally arrived but there was no point in eating it since we were just about ready to leave as hour had almost passed. Whilst other tables were eventually eating their meals. Then suddenly the prawn curry arrived. Green gloop. It transpired it was someone else's CHIKEN !!! curry cold! with one prawn in it! and the flavour was unimpressive more sour than rich by most green curry standards. We sent it back.We manage to find our initial waiter. We told him the situation and he said not to worry he would void our bill and apologised. We left. There was absolutely no obvious structure or organised management line in that chaotic restaurant. Our initial waiter certainly seemed to have the intelligence but not the status to oversee some of the problems. Sending out cold food is bad enough and not even cooking or reheating it to the right temperature is an environmental health issue! As for allowing a piece of shellfish to get into a chicken dish if the customer is allergic is negligent! So if you really want a good well balanced Thai green curry I'm surprised to say I will recommend ThaiExpress. It is usually consistent you always know what you're going to get. And it takes me back to Thailand 25 years ago everytime I eat Thai green curry there. But in Kallang Leisure you'll have to ignore moody male managements bad days. Internal politics As for Nara I'm sure there are many more places to eat where the service is better, the food is hot and basic food preparation regulations are are adhered to. We will not be returning. Singapore if full of excellent restaurants . I'll look for a Thai worthy of great recommend.

The food was really good!!!! Tried many dishes, all excellent. But the server, was not nice at all. She seemed to be upset. She forgot one plate and tried to say it was us who did not order it. Then she found it out on her iPad and ordered it. She seem to not like we ordered water. All other personnel were nice and helpful.

Thai cuisine is one of my favorite foods and I have tried most of the Thai restaurant in Singapore. This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Singapore. The food is super yummy, staffs are friendly and attentive and atmosphere of the restaurant is very good. We went there for family dinner with my wife, my mom-in-law, and brother-in-law. We ordered Papaya salad with shrimp, Clear seafood tom yum soup, mixed vegetables, shrimp cakes, tom yum fried rice and fried soft shell crab with garlic. Fried soft shell crab with garlic is super delicious and it is one of the must-try dishes. All the foods were served within a reasonable time. The price is at a bit high sided and the portion of foods is not very much. However, the quality of food is superb and they are absolutely delicious. I would definitely go there again and whoever love Thai food should try there
5
We tried a few dishes, the green curry chicken, phad thai, morning glory and crabmeat omelette were absolutely delicious. I would definitely go back there again!
3
Today we went for late lunch at Nara Thai . The food here are delicious but the service need to improve because late lunch no much customer yet serving are too slow.
5
Good dining experience for the first time at Nara Thai and great service. Ordered most of their signature dishes.
3
This was our last meal in Singapore before hopping back on the plane to Australia.We arrived before the rush and were quickly seated, and given the menu. However it all started to go downhill from there. It took them a while to come back to take the order and even longer to bring the food. It was getting close to 1 hour, and we had to flag the waiters down a few times to let them know, we were running out of time. I was about to walk out, due to such a long wait. Finally the food arrived, it was good, but the service needs to be brought up to scratch.The final bill was quite reasonable
3
Me and my friend went there while shopping in Ion Orchard. It was late lunch so the restaurant was not so packed. We ordered 2 set meals and 1 dessert & soup set. My set meals came after a few minutes. But my friend has to wait for 30 minutes to get hers. After we finished, I noticed that I receive only juice from dessert & soup set and no soup at all. So, I told the waiter to remove soup price from my bill before issuing bill. Then he said he would get the soup right now. What's the point taking soup after whole lunch was completed. They need their service level upgraded
3
We rarely visit ION Orchard as it is such a busy place but we made special effort to dine at Nara Thai restaurant as I and my colleagues have catered from them a number of times. We did not feel much of an ambience when we arrived and were shown to the table. The service was not very welcoming and when my husband and I sat side by side rather than across each other, no effort was made to shift the placemat, cutlery and the menu to where I was seated. No drinks were offered and I had to ask for water twice. We were disappointed to learn that the chicken served were all from frozen meat and only dark meat; none of the chicken dishes offered breast meat like what we so enjoyed in Thailand. One of the wait staff was particularly sour-faced. I asked very politely for some nam pla (I have used the Thai word for fish sauce from my Thai recipe books since the 80s) and when she did not understand I said fish sauce and she replied curtly 'I do not speak Thai'. I felt the remark was most unnecessary as I only used one word. A better response from a service staff interested in being friendly to a customer would be, 'Oh I am not familiar with that word but I learnt something today'. The Thai fish cakes we ordered were delicious as we remembered from our catering. The Massaman Beef Curry was very tasty, the meat nice and tender although a bit oily. The crab omelette was alright but did not have crab flakes on the top as showing in the menu. We also each ordered a set dish that came with rice, chopped chicken with basil, a fried egg and a few cucumber slices. The waiter said he could change the white rice to the (bluish) butterly pea rice (which I always order when catering) and we appreciated that he was thoughtful and flexible only to find out later that we were charged additional $2 each for the change. We told him he should have mentioned and checked if we wanted to pay extra as we would have not since white rice costs $1.90 and butterfly pea rice $2.50. We should have only been charged at most the difference of 60 cents!! It is not the amount so much as the principle behind it. We also noted that one of the other waiters was extra pleasant to a European customer and addressed him as 'Sir' which was different from the service we received. Overall, as much as we would like to have the Massaman curry again and try some of the other interesting dishes, I doubt if we would return at least not for a while. The meal cost $102 for the two of us with only tap water to drink (charged $1 each) so a bit pricey for us. I guess for a quick set lunch where you have no time to pay attention much to service but just have time to eat and rush, the set lunches seem a good option

We had a bad experience and would not coming back. Food was mediocre but the experience was just bad. Everything takes a while here. The waitresses are poorly trained as they aren't polite if not rude. In addition to the regular dishes, we ordered kids meal and it comes with an ice cream for dessert. But although we have reminded the waitresses twice to bring the ice cream, it took almost 10 minutes till they brought it out (I mean how long does it really take to scoop an ice cream and sprinkle a few chocolate on top of it?). We dined around 2pm and the restaurant wasn't packed at all. And when we asked the waitresses about our food, their faces didn't seem very nice. I wasn't alone to notice the waitresses' response but so did my wife. No wonder they're no longer rated as one of the best.

Not having tasted Thai food for quite a while, I thought I will bring my mum to try out this restaurant with me. I like my usual Thai Olive Rice and the Chicken Wings stuffed with Minced Pork but to my disappointment, both of these items are unavailable in Nara. We requested for the Prawn Tom Yum Kung to be changed to Seafood Tom Yum Kung as we preferred to hv a mixture of seafood. The soup is good although not better than others served elsewhere but what is really yummy is the Yum Som O (pomela salad). I would have loved to have double portions of this as it's so appetising and much better than a lot of Thai Mango Salad. The next item is one that I have never tasted in a Thai restaurant before-it's the Kao Phad An Chan (butterfly pea fried rice $2.50). I don't know if this is an authentic Thai dish but I would definitely come back for this dish alone. We also ordered the Hors d'oeuvre Nara-Assorted Nara's Hors d'oeuvre at $17.90 featuring BBQ pork w Tamarind dip, Thai fish cakes, Pandan chicken and a small pomelo salad. This dish gives one the chance to try an assortment of Thai dishes but I find them all unremarkable. Will still give it a chance by coming back for a repeat of the butterfly pea fried rice and the pomelo salad and perhaps try other items on the menu.

Authentic enough Thai food with wide variety.. food is slightly pricier but worth it if you want a relaxed environment that isn't noisy. Suitable with space to put baby pram. One of a disappointing food was the soft shell crab in curry - too salty. Other foods we tried that were good - pandan chicken, fish with chilli lime sauce.
2
if I ever try to go back there again. They managed our expectations that the food will take at least 15-20 mins to arrive. The chicken curry arrived cold. The crab omelette...well it was more a plain omelette. The sambal Kang Kong was good. But the price we paid for the entire meal was not worth i
5
Went here for dinner with colleagues. We ordered a number of dishes to share and it was amazing. Lovely food, great Thai tastes... Loved it!!!
2
Basic dishes disappointing. Not the authentic Thai tastes. Fried food hd bad old oil taste. Red curry is more like a coconut gravy.
3
Decent thai food with relatively nice ambience. But price was a little high, not exactly most value for money..
3
The Thai food here is quite authentic. Tried a few dishes and like their fried noodles
Prices are also affordable.
Service is ok.
5
Lunch sets were yummy and large in portion, also reasonably priced. Food was fresh and their Thai fish cake was especially yummy!
4
Ala carte prices are a bit steep but the lunch sets are worth it. Service ok. Convenient location in Ion.
3
The food was mediocre. The service was not very nice as it was around 2 PM and all employees themselves were eating. The ambience is also nothing to talk about since it is in a mall. In Bangkok, they can make every dish vegetarian but not here in Singapore
4
One of the best Thai food in town. Love the Pamelo salad. The fried and steam fish are good value for money, great for sharing. Leave room for dessert - they have some unique creations here that cannot be found at other Thai restaurants. Note that they don't serve water. It's 50 cents per person for tap water. When the restaurant is busy, it is hard to get the wait staff's attention so be patient
1
I just realized that they charged me for tab water (the total bill for two was close to SG$100). I am totally surprised and disappointed. Nara use to be one of my favorite Thai restaurants -especially the BKK branch-. Now that they have changed their original menu, having not so good service and charging for the tab water....I will not eat there again. With this attitude -seems quite empty inside- they will not survive much longer in Singapore
5
Wow!!! Such amazing food treated with care and cooked with amazing spices and flavours. The soft shell crab in curry sauce is a must, it was so crispy and flavourful. The chicken and pork dishes were also yummy alongside some powerful dipping sauces and seasonings. My brother had to continue eating after we were all full because we didn't want to leave anything behind, it was just too good to throw away! The price is great since the food was so amazing and authentic
4
The service is good and the food are nice and reasonably price.... Will visit again next time. Recommended.
4
Nice full menu with lots of options. Something for everyone.
Lunch special options as well
Convenient location
5
Food was very nice, staff were very pleasant and attentive. Overall enjoyed the dining experience, will go back again
3
Ambience was not too bad. Food was tasty. We ordered the fried rice, tom yam soup, and chicken phad tai which was not bad. It was tasty but wasn't great as I've had better.
4
Had their Tom Yum noodle soup and stir fried soft shell crab in basil sauce. Excellent dishes that were rather authentic. Prices are steep though.
4
The food was really good and the ambiance was amazing too. The price is slightly on the higher side as its not a fast food joint obviously. If you need to take someone out of a celebration or a proposal this would be quite ideal. Dont miss their sticky mango rice. Its generally sold out as its totally awesome
4
It all started with a warm welcome, and we were impressed all the way, from the service, food to the ambience. Wow, it was beyond words. We ditched the standard Tom Yum seafood fare and ordered the Tom Yum Pork ribs and boy, it won us over instantly. We had a hearty meal, fantabulous dinner and bound to be back for more! Overall, it is all hits and no misses! A great bang for your bucks!
1
my first time in singapore, but not the first for my family. went to food hall and picked Nara based on advertising out front.50 cents for a glass of water ?three white wines on list, ordered a bottle but not available by bottle, only by glass ?. other wine was $75 singapore dollars. at no time were our glasses refilled by staff. it was all self serve. service was bad as the food arrived over a 15 minute interval. was not busy. complained to manager and had 10 % discount off account. but my recommendation remains, do not go to this restaurant, plenty of others to try. stephen
5
we just chanced upon this restaurant while shopping at ion mall at orchard road where we chanced upon this restaurant . to our surprise it had a separate vegetarian menu . All the dishes we tried were just excellent but one has to try A DISH WHICH IS A DEEP PURPLE COLOURED RICE. WELL NEVER EVER TASTED SUCH A DISH BEFORE. just out standing.. The raw mango salad was also great. A must visit for a staunch vegetarian like me
2
The food was below average and the service even worse. We ordered fried rice, mango salad and chili basil chicken. The fried rice looked like it had been re-heated and a few days old, and serving sizes where small for price. Flavors were average but I prefer places like E-Sarn Thai and Long Chim. Main issue was the service, which was slow and unfriendly. They even insisted on charging us 50 cents for table/tap water. First time ever in Singapore! Oh well we will not be coming back here, supposed 'awards' or not..
5
We were happy with how fast the food got served to our table and were satisfied with the service. The food was delicious as well. We would go back to the place again. Thank you Nara Thai Cuisine:)
2
All the food tasted the same 🙄 rice was too soft . presentation average . Ambiance not too bad though.
4
Tried the tom yum kway teow and it was amazing. The sourish spicy soup was perfect with the kway teow. The roasted pork neck was perfectly done too.
3
Overall food was good. Service was friendly but on the slow side. I dont like places that charge for water especially when I am paying over $100 for a meal.
4
The food makes me feel that I am in Thailand and the set lunches are very worth it! Should check them out.
2
I had lunch here, the ayuthaya noodle soup. The food was good and service ok. This would have been a 3.5, but it's over priced and they charged for tap water which is way it gets a 2. Much better options around.
3
The restaurant was quite dim (which would be perfect if it's a spa venue) for a eating environment. Food is subjective. Green curry was recommended but kuay teow noodle soup is a no-no for the meatballs were plain and soup gravy was too strongly spiced. But I would said the service was good for not many restaurant staff will addressed patrons by their Last Name when making payment
4
While staying at the Orchard road hotel in Singapore I was wondering where to have lunch. I wandered into the Ion mall.Nara Thai is located on the B3 level of the mall amidst other food and beverage options .It's a minimalistic restaurant buzzing during lunch time. The servers were all on their toes and I was seated immediately. They offered me the a la carte menu and also the lunch set menus. I ordered the option of pineapple rice with chicken. The chicken was just fried chicken and no sauce . I asked for some sweet chilli sauce along. The pineapple fried rice was flavourful and wholesome portion size. My recommendation would be to serve a stir fried chicken preparation rather than just a fried chicken on side with some cashew nuts.I ordered for my favourite dessert tub tim crob. It was nicely chilled and well flavoured.Overall a good experience. If you are looking for Thai food and you are at the Ion mall it's a good option
4
Went there with my wife. Food quality is very good. Some food recommendation the spicy pork ball and red curry beef are my favourite. They need to improve on the service side and too overwhelming. Where the hostess stand also the cashier stand. Otherwise it is my fav thai restauran
3
We had tried the dishes at Nara Thai in Bangkok and loved their dishes. So went to Nara Thai in Ion Orchard to try. It was quite an empty restaurant during lunch hours when we went on a Monday. Even though there was no crowd, the staff took a long while before attending to us who had been standing at the entrance for a long time. Service became slightly better after we were seated. Dishes were served promptly and they were pipping hot, which is a good thing. We order the pineapple rice lunch set (value for money set that comes with a prawn paste fried chicken) with a top up of the dessert set that comes along with a lemongrass cooler (very small serving) and a red ruby dessert, and we also separately ordered a crab meat fried rice and a rose lime. Both fried rice were ok, though a bit too oily for our likings. There were hardly much crab meat in the crab meat fried rice though, it's more like a fried rice with eggs instead. The cooler drinks were very small serving and considering the size, the price seems a bit too exorbitant ($6.90 for a small glass of drink). Would I ever go back again? Maybe.. if there are promotions. And my advice is avoid ordering the drinks, it's priced too high. Would go for iced water instead
4
I like this restaurant very much, the quality is consistently good and what's on the menu well represents the Thai food culture. I have tried several options, and I am normally very satisfied.
5
Words can not describe how much my family and me love the food in this restaurant! Favolous! Amazing! Perfectly executed exotic thai dishes with memorable flavours and tastes which make you fall i love with it!
4
Went for dinner on 31st July. They serve you blue rice. The Massaman curry is also good. Worth a try!
2
this is the only thing that i am allowed to say in this forum apparently after it axed my original comments.
Ok i'll go with this then: horrible overpriced Thai food. bad ambience.
3
Nara always been our fave Thai restaurant. Food is great. Never dissappoints. We regularly visit Nara Thai restaurant in Bangkok.This time we went to try Nara Thai in Singapore, ION Orchard. Food still great as usual. But one thing about the service.As we know Nara Thai has its fine service in Thailand, but this Nara in ION Orchard, the service was poor. One of the staff, an Indian guy took our order with this attitude that was very unpleasant. He kept chewing something in his mouth and was not so professional as we expected this Nara restaurant would always be.I hope Nara management would improve the quality of the service in Singapore.
3
If you are looking to have early dinner and Thai food, Nara Thai is an option. Not many Thai food restaurants open throughout the day. We ordered the Hors d'oeuvre Nara, red curry, stir fried morning glory, tom yum noodles with prawns and the blue Jasmine rice. The satay (part of the Hors d'oeuvre) was unfortunately dry and tough to bite and red curry was more sweet than spicy. What made the day was the tom yum noodles, it had the distinctive flavours of sour and spicy. So I'd suggest if you stop by for a meal, try the tom yum noodles. The quantity is large enough to hold your stomach right through without having supper
3
Recently the menu had gone through a change with a list of new items added. The place was not crowded when I came for a light weekday dinner.Hor Mok Ma Praw On ($16.90++)Seafood & Coconut OtahServed in a coconut husk, and topped with coconut milk. The otah was rich and not too spicy. There was chunks of fish, prawns and squid in the otah. Best with rice.Khrim Maphraw Linci Khnom ($7.90++)Yam & Pumpkin in Lychee Coconut CreamThe dessert was served hot. The first taste reminded me of Bo Bo Cha Cha, a local dessert, with the pumpkin tasting like sweet potato minus the sweetness and firmness. The dessert was quite sweet.Do take note that plain water is chargeable at $0.50++.Service was fast and there was free wifi from the mall
3
Unfortunately Nara Thai is in a space that had a fe restaurants come and go a failed. The food is ok, but there is no character or any vibe to this place. Went there twice this year and both times only because I had thai food craving and I live near Ion.
3
Was looking around ION Orchard on Monday evening for a place to satisfy my craving for Thai food and chanced upon this restaurant. The drinks selection was pretty alright (two kinds of beers, two kinds of cocktails) , although when I wanted to order one of their two cocktails, they told me that they ran out of the rose syrup that they use to make it, so I got their other cocktail, the siamese sour, which became a little cloying after a few sips. I would rather have gone for their iced tea since their bar wasn't very big. For the food, I got their Gai Pak Panang (spicy barbequed chicken), which was rather tough and dry, but had a tasty marinade; and their Kuay Tiew Tom Yum Kung (Tom Yum noodles with prawns), which was pretty alright - nothing too special, although the prawns were delightfully crunchy and juicy. The service wasn't too bad, although it could have been better considering there were only 4 to 5 other tables when I walked in, and the counter and other floor staff were simply standing around chatting and joking around with each other. The servers were friendly, however. I enjoyed the interior of the place, and if you're thinking of charging your phone or electronic devices there, there are power outlets at the corner of the table booths. Honestly, if not for the table service and decor, I would rather have eaten at the ION food hall for the same quality of food.

this time back with my wife & family we'd a feast :) for dinner we didn't have a reservation but at 5pm we were seated just behind the greeter's desk but still perfect for younger children!-Pomelo Salad was a mite to crispy with very thick fried garlic bits but still nicely spiced and tasty-Fried Bread with Minced Pork was delicious with a refreshingly tart sweet clear sauce that just hits the spot YUMz-Spicy Fried North Eastern Pork Ball OMG no no no, this is too hot and sour to eat! u prolly must wrap it in the vegetable to balance it out-Grilled Thai Otah was moist and lovely smooth fish flake mix with just the right amount of very spicy-Seafood tang hoon was absolutely delicious YUMz-Fried Rice with Chicken was a little flat but very edible-Mango Sticky Rice was ample with 2 dollops of rice in thick creamy coconut cream with those crispy bits on top to balance the sweet mangoes 2xYUMzwill be bac

Stopped in for dinner 1st night in Singapore.
Seated promptly.
Efficient table service.
Wide ranging Thai menu.
Great authentic Thai food (we were visiting from Bangkok)
3
Food not exactly great and yet expensive. Jasmine rice looks good but tasteless. Nothing great. Their mango sticky rice is their best item.
1
Went with expectation but turn out great disappointment..the Tom Yum was so salty that I hard can swallow 3 spoons..the salad too sour..the beef was over fry and the veg barely make it..and it's very expensive as well..

service was bad.
food was bad.
prices too high for such bad food.
servers not helpful and treated us like crap.
terrible.
4
The food was great! This is my first time trying blue jasmine rice! It tastes like original white steamed rice but with prettier color. I really recommend the soft shell crab with garlic, tom yam kung, and scallops with asparagus. Unfortunately, my additional order took to long so we had to cancel it. But overall, the food was pretty great

The food was just authentic thai! Fish cakes Larb gai Grilled squids and the Tom Yum was just perfect and delicious. I absolutely loved the spiciness in the dishes. The chicken satay was extraordinarily succulent with crispy bites - the peanut sauce was very good too. Also the chicken red curry was super thick and so the chicken fried rice was a perfect complement with the beautiful chunks of soicy chicken with hints of lemon and spices in rice as well as the curry. I will definitely go back again!

Good Thai food. Loved the Steamed Seabass in Lime Sauce. The stir-fried Kang Kong was crunchy and good too. The hot and spicy prawn soup tasted like chilli crab sauce though. Should have gone for Tom Yam soup. They serve only blue-coloured rice, no white rice.
5
If you looking for good Thai cuisine, try this place. The tom yam koong is just delicious and flavorful. Do try their mango salad - sour and spicy. Wide selection of dishes to choose from. Finish of your meal with red ruby and mango sticky rice.
4
We order Tom Yam Soup. My mother can only eat fish and we especially order Tom Yam with fish only in which they can accommodate. Purple rice is quite unique and tasty with thai herbs and spices. Very good food and services. Good recommendation for Thai foo

I'm not all too fond of eating in restaurants based in a shopping mall. However, I have to say that you get value for money in this restaurant.We took the BBQ Pawns accompanied by the Blue Jasmine Rice and the Fried Prawns with yellow curry accompanied by the Braised Noodles in Oyster Sauce.Nice, food, nice place, worth a visit
4
This is very good restaurant located in ion. Enjoyed it very. Rice was good. Well balance for the very hot and tasty soup Tom yum
2
Food portions were small. taste very ordinary.
staff was discourteous and unhelpful. ordered blue jasmine rice and some salmon dish. barely enough for one person.
3
Average and acceptable Thai food... Pad thai and iced milk tea is a bit too sweet but the soft shell crab dishes are rather good.
3
Visited for the first time a couple of weeks ago as recommended by the hotel concierge. Food was good with novelty blue Thai rice. Very busy with waiting time without reservation. Setting was quite typical for a Singapore mall type restaurant.
4
Great food, but service needs improvement. Went with a friend and my mom. The tom yum gung had 3 large prawns in it and spiciness was just right (we asked for less spice). Grilled squid was a bit dry, and green curry was nice.
5
Located in the ION mall. This Thai restaurant serves real Thai food suitable for Singaporians. All the plates where great. A notch less spicy than their Thai counterparts. As an example the goong nam cham pra where better than in many Thai restaurants in Thailand
4
Dine here yesterday. Ordered 3 kind of food. Tom Yum, Pad Thai and ..... Don't know the name.The Pad Thai was good. The Tom Yum is just average. I am a Tom Yum lover. Always ordered Tom Yum wherever I went to Restaurant serves Tom Yum.I prefer the Tom Yum without coconut milk. In Nara, the Tom Yum was with Coconut Milk. The taste was ok, but not my fave
3
like in singapore most of the time everywhere during the timing should queingrestaurant is just ok typically located in the mallprice and quality is very common almost the whole singaporefor 2 approx around sin$ 70 up.. with proper foodtaste should be ok for thai cuisin
4
Very good food, and rather large portion as well. We ordered pad thai, tom yum, fish cake, the blue rice with ground pork (I forgot the name of the dish - but very good still), the chicken satay and lemon grassjelly for drinks.Price is a bit high, but so does every good Thai food, right?Will come again when in Singapore, definitely
5
we searched for good thai food restaurant. while we was at orchad road we searched on tripadvisor and found this restaurant in Ion Mall on level B2its a small but beautiful restaurant. a lot of choises available. test the blue yasmin rice very good. staff very friendl
4
great food and good service, have a lot of items not commonly seen in other thai restaurants. Will come again.
4
Great little find in the ION Centre. The menu catered for all tastes, full meals or salads and snacks. They also serve alcohol, which we passed, choosing instead icy cold fruit drinks which were delicious. The food was lovely, all enjoying the chosen meal. My salad came with a refreshing zing in the form of chilli which after the initial shock was just lovely. A great place to have a nice meal and rest and watch the shopping centre bustle
1
We asked for water and the waitress said to us "You need to pay for the water, it is chargeable for the water" and repeated few times as if we could not understand and could not afford to pay for the water. It would be good if the restuarant is able to educate the waitresses on how to speak properly to the customers. We ordered seafood Tom Yum soup but what was delivered was not what we ordered so we asked of the one the waiters to change and the response was "So what do you want?!" Again, no matter how good the food is or whether it is award winning restuarant, the service speaks alot and will bring down the image and drive away customers. Visited Westgate branch
3
A visit to Nara Thai in Bangkok is a must on my agenda every time I am in Bangkok and I am obviously delighted that the restaurant has come to Singapore. I organized a year-end team appreciation dinner at Nara Thai for 9 persons and the restaurant set us up nicely in the corner of the restaurant. Overall, the quality of the food was good although we had to order double portions of each dish for a large group. The service staff were attentive despite it being a busy time at the restaurant. The only blot on an otherwise great evening, was the unavailability of their mango sticky rice dessert which was to be the highlight for some of us. Great experience and it would not be my last

Book a table for 3 on a Thur night. Well this place is always pack at meal times so YES book a table unless you dont mind standing, waiting in the Q.They do not take reservation for Fri-Sunday if U dont know that. ;)What we ordered....Steam Fish in Lemongrass Lime saucePrawn CakeRed curry with roast duckTomyum Soup with prawnsFried Rice Noodle with chickenSo....the fish was huge, it can be share by 4-5pax , therefore if U are a small eater U might wanna skip this if U are only dinning in 2. The taste was good enough for most people i would say but i prefer it to be more sour given a chioce, but overall its a great dish.Prawn cake was doing just fine. Compare to other places, i find it alittle lack of prawn taste still.Red curry portion was alittle small but because of the heavy usage of coconut cream i think its enough to serve 4pax as it can be abit heavy for most ladies after afew mouth of that. i only had 2 pieces of meat & i'm done with it. Taste is just slighty too sweet for me but its still good.TomYum Soup......Order That. No need much words for this dish i have to say. Prawns were fresh & in big sizes.Lastly the Fried Rice Noodle.....very Bangkok street style taste. Pretty decent, but if U dont wanna have plain rice then well....why not.JTS.....ice/warm water aint free so dont complain when they charge for that.One of the better one if U wanna have Thai Food in SG.Will i go again......Sure, Why not. :
3
On arrival, very busy and many people very happy with their exciting meal. however some of the dishes are nice and other ok. Some foods were so so and very dry. Many items were not in stock to have on the menu. The Blue Rice was very nice. Food is costly too eat, so go as a group and share
4
The food taste is amazing, I'm gone to Nara Thai more than 4 times on November, and every time changing my choice so I have tried more dishes on this restaurant, and all dishes were very tasty. The restaurant is on ION Orchard, so it's not a cheap restaurant, eating 2 people and taking only 3 dishes and iced water (so any drink) you will go to pay around 70-80$
5
~I'd read about Nara before & today my wife & I decided to drop in @ ION for dinner~at 5pm it was relatively light and there were a few tables occupied, later when we left it started to fill up~IDOMITA from Chile, a white was a lovely dry tasty not sweet wine, just nice for my wife~my wife found the Tom Yum Kung (she asked for clear soup which wasn't on the menu) delicious and exactly to her liking :)~Pla Muk Tord Kra Tiem (crispy fried squid with garlic) was amazing smooth & tender perfect YUMz~Kuay Tiew Kua Gai (stir-fried noodles with chicken & cuttlefish) was great, taste like Tawandang's except the chicken here is thigh~Kung Ka Bueang (deep fried minced prawn in spring roll sheets) a bit oily but absolutely tasty YUMz after soaking out the oil!Definitely will be back soon
2
Fresh juices are not fresh, well the lime wasn't. That was after being told no watermelon and no carrot. Chicken with basil and chili was average at best. Little or no basil and very oily. Was going to have desert but they began to clean the floors. The floor cleaner would put anyone off eating.
3
Restaurant is quite popular as you have to queue to get a table. Their novelty staple rice is the blue rice. We ordered the steamed sea bass. Seeing that we were just 2 persons - the waitress should have told us that the fish they have is large and if it was ok to go ahead with it. It was just too much as we also had other dishes ordered together with that. They should be more proactive with their customers to extend a better dining experience
3
Visitied at lunchtime. The food was ok, but nothing special. There are a lot of choices in Ion area and the value for money vs quality at this Thai restaurant is not there
3
The food was service quickly after ordering. However, there was a mess up of the order of the quality and the bill was incorrect. Fortunately, the restaurant is willing to rectify the mistake.
4
Food was average - a little disappointed
Ambience was good - a little dim for lunch though
Service was good - food came really fast. waiter actually greeted me by name as we were leaving the restaurant.
4
Been 3x to Nara Thai (2x @ ION and 1x @Westgate. The most recent visit was in Oct @ ION). The quality of the food has been consistent and above average. The weekday lunch sets provide better value compared to the a-la-carte menu.
4
A great restaurant based at ION Orchard Mall. Good Thai food offered with a good layout of seating arrangements... Good & fast service as well.
5
Good food with excellent staff service though the price is expensive. Wide range of choice of food and easy online reservation.
3
Intended to try the boat noodles as this is Nara Thai's specialty but was told that they were sold out. Rather than trying another place, we decided to order a few dishes instead. The grilled squid was done just right, not chewy nor mushy. The lime sauce that came with it packed a punch. I wasn't sure if it was the sauce that induced us to finish the squid in record time. The squid could have been served hot instead of warm and I felt it lacked the smokey flavor of BBQ (as all grilled seafood usually have). I suppose its in a mall so one can't expect the squid to be grilled on charcoal. I was not impressed with the other dishes, they were alright but not fantastic. All were heavy on the seasoning especially the pork with basil leaves and kang kong. The cook must have been too generous with the lime as the Tom Yum Kung tasted decidedly one-sided - sour. The soup however did come with three large prawns, and not the tiger prawn variety, which I appreciate
3
While exploring this huge mall, we came across nara (they spell it with a lower-case "n" so I'm respecting their depiction of their name). It was busy, but efficient, with orders taken using Apple iPads and the food brought out by different people. The food was good, if not great. We particularly found the whole sea bass to be much blander than we might have hoped. The beef in red curry was good, but the concensus-favorite of our group was one of the appetizers -- the fish cakes. Great taste, amazing sauce! The portion sizes are good, and food preparation is quick. We did not run into anything on the menu that was sold-out. Water is S$0.50 per person with unlimited refills. Try it. Hope this review is helpful to you!
3
Good prices and generous portions. I ordered sesame chicken wings and Tom Yum soup, thinking I'd probably need to order something else. But no, was plenty big. Soup came on a burner, big vat of it, with good sized tiger prawns in shells. Nice presentation. Tried the lemongrass cooler, found it to be too sweet. All in all, though, a solid choice
3
Picked this place for a casual dinner. The noodles I wanted was "sold out" at 8pm when we were there. The mango sticky rice was also sold outMy 2nd choice noodles was ok. My friend's Tom yum noodles looked ordinary and another friend's braised noodles looked bad though the serving was largeQuite disappointing for a "famous" chain from bangkok
1
My spring rolls were frozen. Never going back. Stay away unless you want to ruin your day. The service is also terrible. They have two locations. I tried the one in ion orchard.
5
I've tried a lot of pad thai and I can say that they offer one of the best in the world. It's really close to what they offer in Bangkok.
4
Extensive menu with your traditional Thai option plus some nice extra gems. Very busy, nice atmosphere, quick friendly service. Most warn you, the food is great but spicy.
4
Not planned to go there - were strolling around in the mall and decided to eat... We had to queue for a seat and some ppl were already ordering while not been seated yet.. Kind of odd to me.Finally got seated after 10 mins and started ordering. First came the soft shell crab which was actually really good except in was nearly cold. Rich thick, yummy gravy and 2 nice big soft shell crab. The ordered raw prawns with chili were really great - thick, fresh prawns - the chili dip could have been even more spicy. The tom yum soup was good too with huge gambas inside - nice taste at medium spice. The green curry with chicken was a soso for me - nice really spectacular but still very ok. The fish (sea bass) in lime was very good again even sgd 34 is a little bit high priced but well done this dish. Finally the rice... They dont serve normal white rice but only 'blue' jasmin rice, which is really blue! Taste is similar to normal rice but actually weird for my traditional eye as blue is not an eating colour, for me. On the very negative part i need to complain about the fried rice - we ordered as well fried rice with chicken at sgd 14.90. What arrived was one small bowl of fried rice with some salad/cucumber aside. ONE BOWL ... Serious guys ?? At this price - sorry but that shocked me.Really, your food is good, waiters are nice, even they are quite stressed because of the early closing hours...Waiters give good recommendations like f.e. The soft shell crab... But this fried rice thing was making me confused.... We finished with caramelized mango and ice cream as dessert - yummy too.Allover - food taste is great, service is nice but rushed, prices are high and crazy for the fried rice.. But worth for most other dishes... Maybe better to place the restaurant outside of a mall as staff needs to meet the closing time of the mall...

booked expecting something hopefully close to Nara in Bangkok.very disappointed: - drinks menu was not great, limited cocktails and only serving one wine in a glass (a white) which had to be asked about as it wasn't listed by glass on menu. Weird to be in a Thai restaurant without red wine by glass.- very pricey for the wine glass as well ($14.90 +17% taxes).- rice was overcooked- food portions were very small versus the price - airconditioning wasn't good, very warm inside- decor not up to spec with Nara in Bangkok and tables had a cheap feel to them.- service started ok, but at end it took more than 5 minutes to get attention to get the bill and pay.- the food wasn't really that good either overall. Larb Gai was the closest to being OK.Positives:- took a booking and were waiting for us, no issues with being ten minutes late

I visited the Nara Thai at the Westgate outlet redeeming a 1-1 promotion. I ordered the fried beef with black pepper sauce and the July limited edition shrimp paste fried rice. The beef was ok though on the expensive end at $14.90++ (and I tried the other beef dish before it seems they all taste the same regardless which flavor you order). The shrimp paste fried rice cost $13.90++ and so would be the free dish for the 1-1. Ok granted its free but you can see from the picture I attached it was pathetic! At first I had expected shrimp paste aside but was told its fried with the rice that's why its called shrimp paste fried rice......so lame. It was so bland and tasteless and can you imagine no egg with fried rice? Anybody would had thought egg is basic ingredient in any fried rice but not here, not to mention I was misled by their photo clearly showing fried egg with the rice. Last but not least the measly few tiny pieces of chicken with the dish clearly shows the restaurant has no qualm in serving such poor qualit food and charging $13.90++ for it If I had to pay usual price? I wouldn't even pay $1.90 for it. Utterly disappointed and totally not recommending this restaurant to anyone
3
Food was ok. Not sure why they color rice purple. Couldn't get proper answer either due to language problems. Slow service, I gave up half way thru the meal as I couldn't be bothered asking again for the last dish, yet the charged me for it. In fairness it has been removed after my request. What's good about this place? You can sit down and eat. The food court I found exhilarating busy, and I hate walking and eating at the same time.
2
Really small portionsAnd especially small considering the prices for main coursesBrought everything out at different times .. Which wasn't so much of an issue except that the gap between the dishes was around ten minutes or so.And failed to bring out one main course. When reminded.. Told us they'd made the wrong dish so having it made it again.And then proceeded to bring out the incorrect order.Had to wait again till they took it back and brought back the right one.Really poor service and unfortunately the food doesn't wow either
3
I visited Nara Thai at Ion on a public holiday around 2pm. I chose it because no queues and the reputation of Nara Thai Bangkok. Once I looked at the menu, I found that the price is not cheap. My lemongrass drink is $6.50 per glass - this is really a rip off as it is just lemongrass cooked in water whereas my husband's drink is soursop smoothie, same price but with better substance. We ordered pomelo salad - $13.90,fish cake - also $13.90, one boat noodle with beef - $14.90, and mango sticky rice $6.90, after ++, total bill $73.70. The portion of serving is small and the mango sticky rice only come with half a mango and no coconut sauce. Food is good but pricey, especially when you compare to price in BKK. Would I go again ? I think so but definitely not top on my list

Came here twice on our last visit to Singapore. The place located on lower ground level on Ion Orchard. The place got long line during dinner or lunch service and we managed to get in.I agreed with the other reviewer saying the food was not authentic, but I can recommend this is a good thai food compared to others in Singapore. It lacks of original spices , such as the thai basil not as fragrance, chilli not as spicy as normal thai food should etc. But this is where you can get the close-taste to original thai food possible.We ordered boat noodle soup, taste delicious, a bit spicy, came with meatball. My partner also ordered the pad krapaw (rice with minced chicken and fried egg served with rice). I don't feel comfortable eating the rice that come in purple colour, but tasted just as normal rice. We also ordered pad thai, its nice, came in descent portion. The service was good, food come in just right time, the restaurant doesn't have toilet so you have to use Ion's one
4
Nice oasis for Thai food in Ion on Orchard. Don't miss the barbecue chicken skewers -hot tender but crispy and delicious. Green curry bowl with beef was excellent. Noodles with beef not my favorite because noodles too soggy. Try the pandan drink.
4
The food was good, feels like having meal in Bangkok. Had the blue friend rice and few other dishes. The place is in The Ion Shopping Mall and was really clean and the service was great.
1
Nara at central world bangkok is one of my favorite restaurant. I Love almost everything in their menu.Spotted this Nara at ION several times so I decided to try and expect to get something similarI ordered everything that i usually order in Bangkok. And nothing is taste even close. Compare to Bangkok Nara : Singapore Nara taste awfull. Is this even a Nara ?
5
Aouthentic Thai food with very quick and good service. Visited there with my ex co-workers after the work. Although there were many eaters, foods came to us very very quickly after the order. We ate share salad,fish and soup and individually ate rice. one of rice was quite spicy but others are dicent spicy levels. You can find spicy level in menu. We enjoyed drinking and eating
4
Nara is located in the B3 level of the Ion Orchard mall in its restaurant area. Although the menu is covered by the red chili warning on most of the dishes, it turns out most of them are not that hot at all. We had one vegetarian and were surprised when their vegetable section had dishes with shrimp in it. However they saved the day as they have a separate vegetarian menu. The decoration and service is OK but quite enjoyed the food
3
The food, ambience and service are similar to what one would get in Thailand. Taste of some dishes might be adapted to be less spicy like the Tom Yom soup. Had a grilled whole seabass which was a disappointment - expensive yet hard & dry. The portions are kind of small. Big chunk of the bill goes to the location at Ion. Average cost for this lunch was over S$50 per pax - expensive for a casual lunch
4
Excellent Thai food with all the flavours bursting through - tried the green curry, mango salad, grilled prawns, vegetables - all excellent. The one unusual element was that they don't serve regular jasmine rice but blue jasmine rice. Service could improve and they could have better knowledge of the menu.
4
It is one of the better Thai food restaurants in Singapore. Food is good, though not excellent. Between 2 of us we had mango salad, fish cakes, Pad Thai with soft shell crab, sticky rice with mango and caramelized mango with coconut ice cream & basil sauce. Nothing was bad. The seafood was fresh, specially the prawns in mango salad, which was probably the best dish of the evening. The sticky rice was good but mangoes were not exactly sweet. Overall, a bit overpriced for quality. Sadly, I have yet to find any Thai restaurant here which will come close to food in Thailand. Food wise, I would give Nara Thai 3 to 3.5 stars but the extra star is for service. It is evident that they are short staffed like most establishments these days, but the staff was smiling, friendly & trying their best to accommodate everyone even though they looked tired & frazzled.
4
Nara Thai, Westgate.I tried Nara Thai food when I was in Bangkok, and certainly one of the nicest one I had! Their food in Singapore is similarly authentic than those offered in Thailand, which is great! I love their tom yum gung and papaya salad! However, with the setting of the restaurant, you'd expect a better service. Their staff are unattentive and it took us a while to order our food. If they could improve their service, no doubt I'd give a 5 star to this review. I'd still go back for their food, but have to mentally prepare myself for the kind of service they provide
5
Finally I found authentic Thai Food Restaurant to dine and to die for in Singapore and dare to introduce Nara to friends and business partners...perhaps may not be a place for business talk lunch or dinner but its surely a place to have pleasure dining with real THAI foods..
4
Great food (had the red curry chicken) and the service was excellent. The only downside was it was a bit expensive for the quantity served. About $24USD for curry , rice, and small mango drink.
3
The food is slightly above average but the price is very expensive near to fine dining.
Nice ambience .
1
Young guy manager who worked on 25mar evening was rude, insensitive and clueless about basic customer service! Not only is the food expensive, but 2.50 per pax for a plate of white rice?
4
This is one of my favourite thai restaurants in Singapore. Almost all th dished I've tried are very good. Very favoursome. The thai curry prawns can be changed to softshell crabs. Tom Yum Soup is a must and the thai soufflÃ© ( thai otah ) is worth trying
5
We went with our Australian friends and Thai friend, and they loved it.The food is tasty and authentic. Our favorite dish is 'Tom Kha Kai', coconut chicken curry. However, the service is quite slow and there are a little bit of confusion on available wine range and serving process- 2 out of 3 wines are not available and the waitress only know after we ordered, appetizers came after main dishes
4
My friend and I ate at this restaurant twice while we were in Singapore. Everything we ordered was delicious. The first time out we had the Gai Pak Panang, which was like chicken satay, and chicken with cashew nuts. The second time we ordered the Tom Yum Kung, which was prawns in spicy lemongrass, and Phad Thai. The Tom Yum Kung was especially good and SPICY! I don't recall much about the service; it must have been okay. One tacky point--you must pay for cold tap water. Seems a bit cheap. If you are in the Orchard neighborhood, this is a good place for dinner and easy to find
4
Was recommended by my sis' friend... We ordered quite a lot of dishes such as the steamed fish with chilli lime, minced meat with basil, pandan chicken etc. The food is really good! I think one of the best Thai restaurant around... Definitely will come back! Oh, the coconut ice cream dessert is pretty nice too!Restaurant is quite crammed, so not really good for children...
4
My sister and I went to the ION branch for dinner on the 5th day of Chinese New Year. We ordered steamed whole sea bass with spicy chilli lime sauce, stir-fried kale with oyster sauce and Pad Thai . The food we ordered is good and tasty. I cannot say too much about the service as we were there at 5.15 p.m for early dinner as both of us agreed to have our dinner early to avoid the crowd and unwanted frustrations
2
I have been to this restaurant 3 times. Service is poor as they do not seem to have enough wait staff. The few they do have, don't seem to care too much about customers. Food is generally good. Soups are nice. Steamed sea bass is very good. But every chicken dish I had so far has the horrible uncooked chicken taste. This happened twice and I have given up on chicken in this restaurant. Other than their chicken, everything else is good
4
We were visiting Singapore and decided to hook up with nephew and his girlfriend. Since we staying at Orchard Road we asked him to recommend a nearby restaurant as after dinner, we would already be heading to Changi to catch our flight back to Manila. I was a little taken aback when he recommended thai food, as i love Singaporean food and was hoping to try something "native", as he might know better since he lived there. But Nara did not dusappoint. We went to the one in Ion orchard and it was quite full at 7pm. Menu was extensive, but my nephew who first tried this restaurant in Bangkok said, the offerings in Singapore were brief as compared to the one in Thailand. We ordered the usual suspects, pad thai, curried soft shell crabs, but for me the best dish was the green chicken curry. It couldn't be better, creamy curry with just the right kick! Pomelo salad was delicious as well, so was the satay. Excellent meal all in all. I was also surprised with the speed of the service, within 5 minutes, almost all orders were on the table! Would i eat here again? Yes! I might even find myself in Bangkok soon, who knows?
3
Foods are good, but waiters give me a feeling they are not willing to serve ,when I ask for the food that take long to serve they just asked need to wait
4
Food was tasty and the presentation of food was good.
Staff should take initiative to refill ice/warm water since it was chargeable.
3
Had heard a lot about this place. went on a weekend with family. the food was ok. there are other better thai joints in Singapore at better prices. the service was very poor. we had reached around 1 1/2 hour before closing. the restaurant full. the staff however, seemed to be more intent to pack up and go home. not sure if it is like this every day but this day was bad. both us and the guests on the table beside us did not get a dish that we had ordered. had to get that cancelled finally. for the cancellation also it was not smooth and one had to wait. anyway, the food itself was very average. we ordered quite a few dishes - probably 8 dishes for a table of 3 - all the food was very basic - none of them tasted out of the world. very pedestrian. dont think i will repeat.we were there with our little girl - no special cutlery for her, nothing to keep her occupied. atmosohere is OK but nothing great. like any other regular joint in Singapore
4
After having tried most of the nearby restaurants we asked the hotel reception for ideas. They suggested this restaurant. Wasn't expecting much from a Mall restaurant. However I was pleasantly surprised. Had to queue for 5 mins or so but the staff and service were good. The menu was varied and the food we ordered very tasty. I would go back
2
I recommended Nara Thai in Westgate to my friends as I had tasted good meals in Nara Thai Central World in Bangkok and Nara Thai in Ion S'pore. But every dish was lacking.I had to apologize to my friends for the poor food standard.The pomelo salad was much too sweet. The Thai Fish cake was not firm and looked and tasted like it had been fried in black oil.The Kaeng Panaeng chicken in red curry tasted queer - too much curry powder and the coconut milk did not taste good too. We complained about this dish and requested for a change. The waiter carried it to the kitchen but brought the same dish back again announcing that the cook had found nothing wrong with it. "So the cook tasted from our dish?" I commented. We did not finish this dish.The Tom Yum Kung river prawns in spicy lemon soup was ok although it was a tad too sour.Each bowl of rice cost $1.50 - overpriced.Our dilute lemon grass drinks cost $5.50 per mug - a rip off.The unsatisfactory meal cost an exorbitant $97.20The staff members were engrossed in private conversation instead of attending to our needs.Needless to say - we will NOT be returning.I hope the main office will check and improve the standard of cooking in their restaurants as I have read complaints on Trip Advisor about Nara Thai in Ion too

My wife and I visited this restaurant at Westgate, Singapore on Monday evening around 7.30pm. This is not the one at Orchard Turn.The place is spacious and very clean. The waiters/waitresses are courteous and well mannered.The menu is neatly filled photos of the dishes with their names in Thai and English. However we were puzzled to find that some of the dishes were repeated in other parts of the menu. If one does not spot this one might probably think that the restaurant has a lot of dishes.We ordered a pomelo salad as an appetizer and for the main course, we had Massaman curry with chicken, and stir-fried kale with oyster sauce.We are curious about the Massaman curry but the waitress serving us was not able to explain what it was except to say it was a very good dish. (Massaman curry is actually coconut rich mild Thai curry.)We found the pomelo salad extremely sweet. The sweetness spoilt an otherwise nice dish. The Massaman curry was too creamy and too rich. This can be seen by the layer of oil floating in the dish. If you are someone who is watching your oil intake, this is a dish to avoid.The kale dish was good and that was the only dish we enjoyed.It would be good if the waiters/waitresses were able to clearly explain the dishes. For older customers and for those who are health conscious, this would be helpful. It would also be good if they could make recommendations to us. Would I visit this restaurant again? I doubt it
2
We waited for 15 to 20 minutes for our tbale in front of the restaurant in Ion, Orchard. Having a quite long queue, we thought that the food was going to be excellent. However, my expectation was too much apparently. My partner and I ordered 4 dishes, 2 mains from rice section and 1 fish + 1 Nara Assorted meat. All costed us for SGD 99.00We enjoyed the fish dish very much. It was fried and seasoned well. Really satisfying. However, the rice dishes were obviously overpriced (13 - 15 SGD each portion with mainly rice on the plate). If I were to come again, I would definitely not order anything from the rice section. Oh, I really have to say this:We had a pleasant service from one of the crews named "CK" on his uniform. He greeted us with sincere smile and he gave us a nice secluded table in the corner.

I visited this restaurant twice, their food standards cannot compare with the one in Bangkok at all. When I first tried their “Kuay Tiew Sukhothai-Re Sukhothai Noodles”, the taste is still acceptable, but on my second visit, the taste has been changed to “sweet, very sweet” and nothing else. The staff recommended me to try their “Phu Nim Phad Pong Karee Stir- Fried Soft Shell Crab” and I was told that this is very nice and popular, but it turned out to be very sweet and oily. I told the staff about my comments and she just smile and said nothing else. For this type of poor food standards and care free service attitude, I will not visit this restaurant again

Must order: The Thai herbal rice (purple rice) and Pomelo SaladOnce the crowd rolls in, server tends to get overwhelmed. Instead of doing recommendation, they just keen to get the order and move on to next table.Tables are placed too closely together especially table for 2 person

We had for dinner this evening at Nara (see photos uploaded): (1) Hors d'Oeuvre Nara (too dry and sweet, fish cake not lacked chewy texture); (2) Stir-fried Morning Glory (OK); (3) King Crab in Yellow Curry (good crab and curry - delicious); and (4) Stir-fried minced chicken with basil (did not expect it was minced meat, lots of garlic, OK).For deserts, we had (a) Mango and Sticky Rice with Coconut Milk; and (b) Durian and Sticky Rice with Coconut Milk. Both were yummy, especially the Durian.Nara charged S$0.50 for tap water per person. So I had one bottle of Australian syrah instead (Tatty Road 2013 at S$58).Together with two servings of Steamed Rice, the total charge came to S$203.40.We found the Nara dishes rather sweet, and the crabs not comparable to the mud crabs we had in Australia. However, the service staff were very attentive, friendly, and helpful, resulting in an enjoyable dining experience for us

We tried the Nara at Ion Orchard. The crab omelette was good but the beef in the Masala beef curry dish was not as good as the one we tried in the suburbs of Sydney.

If you looking for a fine dining yet reasonable priced Thai restaurant in Orchard Road area, then Nara Thai would suit you needs.
Delicious set lunch options are available here with special mention of mango salad.

They boost themselves with TRIP-Advisor best of 2013. May be they were, but not anymore. Three of us ordered three main courses and appetizers and non of us thought anything was special here. My Tom-Yum soup was very sour.

Visited the one in Ion, basic dull unimaginative decor, tiny tables cramped together so you hear the conversation in the next table. Food was disappointing, you can tell they try to adapt the menu from the popular Nara restaurant in Bangkok, but it disappoints with several blank areas on the menu. The pomelo salad looked good with several plump prawns presented on top- but when the actual dish came we enquired that the prawns were missing as it wasnt like the photo, the waiter replied that its like that, took the dish away only to return it to say the prawns was at the bottom - we found 3 tiny prawns eventually! Satay was flattened and tough, vegetable dish was a tiny portion, phad thai chicken was oily and gooey, with tasteless chunks of chicken thrown in. Overpriced for what you get, and overrated in Sing

We have tried Nara Thai in BKK and was wowed by the wide range of dishes and good food. Therefore decided to try out the ones in Singapore. The food wasn't too bad. (side note, bbq chicken on stick was a little too tough) But noted several dishes were missing from the menu. What disappointed us most is the inattentiveness of their staff.There were 4 of us, but being small eaters, we decided to share 3 plates of rice. Only 2 plates of rice was served. The other 2 of us didnt have a serving plate. The 3rd plate of rice was wandering all over the restaurant despite our efforts to signal them that it was ours....We ordered Tom Yum Soup. When they brought it out to us, the waitress just left it on the table without even bothering to help rearrange the rest of the dishes. Right after that, she walked away. We did not have serving bowls and she didn't even notice. The moment she turned away, she shared a joke with her fellow colleagues and made a loud laugh which startled all of us. Basically, most dishes were served to us without much customer service in mind. Literally dumped in front of us and we had to figure out how to place them.In general, if you want good food, it is an 'okay' place to go if you don't mind poor customer service. Prices are alright as well.But if you'd prefer a better dining experience, until they step up on customer service, you may want to look for an alternative

Tucked away in a corner of Westgate in Singapore, is this small, casual Thai restaurant. The location gives it a bit of quiet from the rushed shopping crowd.When I called to make my reservations, a lady (Yvonne) assured me of her personal service when I got there. And she kept her promise. Yvonne served very efficiently and was able to recommend dishes to us. She also ensured that the few requests we made were carried to the chef.Food was basic Thai fare- Tomyum, salad, beef paneang, steamed fish with lime sauce... Food was generally tasty except that the Tomyum was quite sweet

My wife and two friends tried this new outlet for the first time on a Saturday. We ordered an appetizer combo (it contained pandan leave chicken, fish cake), prawn cakes, tom yum soup, deep fried garoupa fish. All the dishes were delicious. The pandan leave chicken and prawn cakes were especially good because the chicken and prawns were very fresh and well cooked and I could see the steam came out when I cut through them. For dessert, we had mango with sticky glutinous rice and tapioca with coconut milk sauce. Again these were very good especially with the sweetness of the mango.With high expectation, my wife and I went back again for dinner one of the week days the following week. Thjs time, we were disappointed. The landan leave chicken was not well cooked and tasted a bit mushy. We tried something new, the crab omelette this time. It was not cooked through at some parts and we were given a replacement. Although it tasted good, I would not recommend this because the taste of the eggs covered any taste of crab which was little.The pricing was verging on the high side. But this is supposed to be a fine Thai restaurant

Even though there's a lot of Thai restaurants out there, a true authentic one is kinda hard to find in Singapore. Tried Nara for the first time back in June 2014 and totally blown away. Everything in the menu that we ordered had that true Thai taste to it. The ambiance also nice. Even in mid-day with lunch crowds, the service there was top-notch! The waiter also recommend some menu that we wouldn't be ordering otherwise (and it turned out to be YUMMY!). My partner wasn't a picky eater while on the contrary, I am. So deciding where and what to eat could be a total disaster sometimes. But at Nara, I could proudly say that it's definitely a place to go when you're craving for that authentic Thai taste. Lovely job, Nara Thai! Four thumbs up

I live in Bangkok, and on my way to San Francisco I stopped overnight in Singapore. I wanted to dine at Nara since a while, so I decided to give a try.I was together with a thai friend... So he knew what to order. We had tom yum soup with tiger prawns (spicy at thai levels); prawn salad (pla Kung.... To die for); morning glory, and soft shell crab with yellow curry(a must). So.... A perfect thai dinner before 10 days in USA. I read some previous comments comparing this restaurant to the Bangkok's venue. I really found no differences,..... And if so, just on the positive side . So; either ownership reacted to old comments , or I had just a lucky night (....... I don't think so). Prices of course are not as in Bangkok, but for Singapore they are still ok. Highly recommende

Located in orchard road's ion mall basement.
Good authentic thai food. Newly opened for less than a year.

An unexpected find while visiting Singapore. Had lots of Thai food in our travels, but Nara stands out. Its menu is comprehensive and authentic, plus service is very good! Will suggest if if you are in SG and looking for alternative Asian fare.

As a Thai person, I was very impressed with this restaurant's cooking style. It's pretty darn authentic, at least for the 2 dishes I tried. Their mango salad is as yummy as how my grandma in Thailand makes it and the larb meatballs were very interesting and delicious too

We visited the restaurant's new branch at Westgate Mall, which is partitioned into airconditioned and alfresco dining areas. The former is a minimalist Thai dining room while the latter resembles a no frills bistro rather than a fine dining restaurant.Many of the dishes on the menu of Nara's flagship restaurant in Bangkok are available here, with the only difference being the SGD prices which are marked up substantially from those in Bangkok, reflecting the higher rentals, operating costs and prices of imported ingredients in Singapore. As in Bangkok, the Singapore restaurant levies 10% service charge and 7% VAT on all menu prices.As we visited at lunch on a weekday, there was a two course set lunch which was great value at SGD14.90++ which works out to just USD15.00 nett per head. The set meal comprises either a soup or appetizer, choice of main course and a non-alcoholic beverage. As the restaurant had opened for less than a month, only three set meals were offered when we visited. These were:* spicy shrimp broth ( tom yum goong) and basil chicken served with jasmine rice;* 'larb' ~ a popular chopped salad from Northern Thailand and red curry served with jasmine rice;* grilled chicken with mango salad and rice noodle soup with lean pork and meatballs.The tom yum and red curry were fragrant and tasty, but also fiery hot and had us reaching for our glasses of iced water. Even the basil chicken and larb are spicier than the versions usually served in Thai restaurants in Singapore. Those with low spice tolerance thresholds should order the noodles which are mild. The ingredients used were fresh and of good quality; the chef stayed true to the recipes from the flagship Nara Restaurant in Bangkok and met their excellent standards.Service at the new restaurant at Westgate was, however, a hit and miss affair. We were seated by a China waitress who had a very limited understanding of English and the menu. When we tried ordering some a la carte items, she did not seem to comprehend us and requested us to point to the pictures on the menu. We gave up ordering hor d'ouevres to supplement our set meals. Subsequently, the local and Thai waitresses who served us had no problems understanding English and were warm and friendly

I was very happy to hear from a friend that the famous Nara restaurant from Bangkok is now opened in Singapore and right in the Orchard road area, ION Orchard. The first thought was "now I don't have to fly to Bangkok for this restaurant"Flew to Singapore to try out this restaurant. We called to make a reservation but was told no reservations can be made for the weekend dining! Wow ! I thought must be like the Nara in Bangkok where the restaurant was packed with dinners from opening to closing time. Anyway we decided to go early and we managed to have a table straight away.The menu looked the same as the Nara in Bangkok but with less choices. We ordered the fried beef, chicken green curry, fried fish with their special sauce and quite a number of dishes. Our favourite was the big prawns with a sweet tamarind sauce. The waiter took our order of about eight dishes and within five minutes most of the dishes were served ! wow! fast food ! like the food court ! We asked the same waiter "was the food already cooked ?" He was very polite and said that is not like fine dining in Bangkok! ( actually in Nara Bangkok, is not fine dining but certainly not fast food ) The prawns were too crispy and there was hardly any tamarind sauce on the prawns except a slight drizzle. Anyway since we ordered the dishes we ate them but definitely no comparison to the real Thai food from Bangkok.To end our meal we thought we would try our favourite desert, the coconut ice-cream served with all the lovely side dishes of nuts ,corn, water chestnuts ,cendol and fresh jackfruit , but alas the disappointment came , the ice-cream was slightly melted and the jack fruit was tinned!The mango and sticky rice was also not so good, the mango was not sweet and the coconut cream on the sticky rice was not fresh.I am very surprised that the owners were not there to see the difference in taste to the original restaurant. I was also told that the chef have to make it more spicy for the local Singapore taste!I would only recommend the Nara Bangkok

Finally, was excited that my favourite restaurant from Thailand opened its door in Singapore.Went on a Saturday evening and was not overly crowded. Was so looking forward to having my favourite boat noodle but to my disappointment they did not have it that day. So decided to settle for their basil minced pork with rice which is not too much to my liking. However the tom yum kung with the big prawn was great. They also do not serve hot lemongrass drink, another disappointment. On the overall, all was still ok but still think thr one at Central World BKK standard still fares better

A rather empty restaurant with staff standing around ad I had to stand at the entrance in front of a staff for 10 mins before a lady cut in to ask the staff about mango with sticky rice. Then came the manager who spoke to the lady. I was being ignored all the time. I have to asked if I can have a table for 2 before they decided to serve me. Ordered fried morning glory, tomyum kung, minced pork with basil, green curry chicken. All of the dishes were below average

It's interesting that for their first franchise overseas, Nara have chosen to go high volume/downmarket (locating itself in Basement 3 of ION Orchard where a Burger King used to be, instead of the upper floors), although the formula here is also more popular than at the Bangkok original. The food is good and flavorful, with some unusual dishes rarely found elsewhere. Naturally, they will adjust the level of spiciness for all dishes. Service is so-so, except if you get the front-room manager who is excellent (but maybe he won't stay after the opening period.

The food here was some of the worst Thai food I have ever eaten. The shrimp cakes (tord mun kung) were passable but only just. We also ordered a second starter ( which arrived after we had almost finished our main dishes) - barbequed chicken in a spicy thai marinade. The problem was someone had forgotten the spicy marinade. It was like chewing pieces of rubber. Massaman curry just didn't taste fresh at all. I ordered beef and was brought chicken and it was impossible to identify individual flavours at all. Worst of all was that the pieces of chicken were hot on the outside but undercooked inside. The minced pork dish wasn't at all memorable. Again it was impossible to identify individual flavours.Not cheap, the meal for two cost SGD85. It's not a place we would return to

Never have green curry chicken that bad; no fragrance (green with no curry flavor) and the chicken meat was rubbery. can't even find the tiny eggplant. The so called river prawn were farm raised shrimp with no taste at all (river prawn have really long claws and freshwater). The eggplant with minced pork was a plate of mush.The shrimp patty was the only half decent dish. The bill for 2 - over 100 SGD The worst was the service - poor even by Singapore standard. How can this be the same Nara from Bangkok
