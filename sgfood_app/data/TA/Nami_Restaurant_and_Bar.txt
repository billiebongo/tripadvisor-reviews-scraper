Pleasant service. Food mediocre, not worth the price. Seated near the kitchen, atmosphere destroyed by constant chatter and occasional shouts from inside.

Disappointing as compared with other high end Japanest restaurants, like Shinji, Ishi, etc.
Service was poor.
Food so so below expectation.

I ordered the eel rice lunch set. When it arrived, I was disappointed by the thin slices of eel and the textual of the rice. Not at all near in quality and quantity of Tokyo eel restaurant!

Stayed at the Shangri-La hotel for a week and tried Nami for dinner one night. The restaurant is very nice and service is impeccable, but the food was very average. We eat a lot of sushi and know what’s excellent and what’s not. The prices here scream tourist trap. It’s all about the location and view because the food isn’t worth the price. Have found other local places that compare to other high end sushi places we frequent in Los Angeles

Soon after dinner, I experienced stomach upset. When I reached home, I had diarrhea till wee hours. My husband called the hotel, the follow up was unprofessional and insincere. We felt very letdown by the restaurant, part of the renowned Shangri-La Singapore. My birthday dinner is ruined by this episode

Thank goodness it was a rainy day I can imagine it would be rather glaring on the eyes on a hot day..I hardly complain or write bad reviews .. have always been a frequent customer at all shangri la outlets but was extremely disappointed at the tempura with the sweet sauce ... the Chef ought To try the tempura at the regent hotel .. found it soggy and rice Too covered with the sauce The service was good They should have retained the nadaman Chef ... I took home most of the rice needed some extra rice None was given I said just a spoonful more ...Usually for Japanese restaurants the takeaways are usually well packed and Japanese style tis the standard to wrap the pickles separate from the rice ... the take away was worse than Hawkers style ... BAD news shangri la My tenant who is a Chef told me do do donki has fresh ingredients for sale and tis 24 hours do not like your menuPrefer kaiseki sets as before at $35 Plus plus from the old nadaman menu.. my lunch was over $50 I was in no mood to take any food pictures the presentation was below average .. attached the takeaway leftovers from my meal The management made a mistake Moving the Japanese restaurant To the TOP floor

Nami is the latest addition to the dining outlets at Shangri-La Hotel. We have chosen the Hokkaido set menu which we appreciated the fresh seasonal products from Hokkaido and the fine culinary skills by the chefs. This restaurant also provides panoramic views of Singapore since it is on the top floor (24th) of Tower Wing for a very pleasant dining experience. The service is also good and attentive

We had reservations to eat at this restaurant for over a month and they told us that it was totally booked up. We were surprised when we saw several vacant tables. The meal was expensive and nothing out of the ordinary. We were expecting so much more. The entrance to the restaurant is very stupid with half curtains hanging to no where.

Great skyline view and nice sashimi, if pricey at $180 - but rest of lunch and service were disappointing. Was served by the senior staff who had little appreciation of high-end Japanese cuisine (probably rotated from another F&B within hotel) e.g. couldn't diffrentiate sweet soyu for sashimi dipping with regular soyu for cooked dishes... was served two beef main courses when it was a discussion with her which was the better... the beef nonetheless was served almost done when medium rare was requested - worse was the grilled beef looked/tasted like broiled beef - thumbs down. We ate it cos it seemed such a waste having already rejected one. They brought out Japanese chef to apologise but Akira-san spoke little English and likely understood nothing of what I said... table left unwiped after main courses... no one to show us out nor greetings of 'irasshaimase' when we left... despite the $450 bill for lunch for 4, felt more welcome at Sushi Tei than here. Not coming back and won't recommend to anyone. I sent Shangrila a feedback - no reply - just says it all..

The view is wonderful (5). Food is good but not to the level of some of the competition but hey the price is also more reasonable. Had the omakase lunch which was just the right amount but i guess i didn't like some of the dishes (4). Service staff is fantastic and polite, full marks there (5). Overall worth a visit

Excellent Japanese food. We loved the sashimi but their marinated cod was to die for. Make sure to reserve, or you won't get a seat.

The quality and freshness of ingredients plus attentiveness of the restaurant team, made it really an experience. Wow - we will certainly come again!

Went to Nami after reading the good reviews. Was looking forward to a great, romantic night of good food and wine. We were there early, slightly after 6 pm. There was just a group of 7 and 2 tables of couples, including us. Started to look at the menu and ordered the Omakase as recommended by the several people who have reviewed the restaurant. Then, we were told that for the omakase dinner menu - None of the signature dishes is included and IF we want to include a couple of them, prices will be adjusted! Wow...this is in addition to sets that are already costing $190 or $220. So, no! We end up with the Hokkaido set with no signature dishes - $180. What a unpleasant start of our night. Then we waited for the food - in spite of the restaurant being pretty empty then - we waited quite a while. The appetiser finally came, after that, the next 2 courses were stalling again - about 15 minutes wait for each course. We finally told them to speed up. They tried. As the restaurant started to have more guests, we found ourselves sandwiched between a couple with a restless toddler and a group of 4, with one of the ladies talking at the top of her voice and laughing at high pitch. What is most ironical is that one of the 4, was wearing a Shangri La Hotel staff badge - sure, I understand that entertaining your VIP guests is very important to you BUT please at least have the basic courtesy to be considerate to your other "very much less important customers", kindly DO remember that we are still your customers who pay to dine at your hotel !! To top it all, service was poor. We ended up pouring our own sake. We needed to wave for attention to get refill of water. We also had to ask for refill of green tea. I don't think the restaurant is short of staff, it is just that they will walk right past you, without even glancing to see if glasses are empty. We spent about $500 bucks for the 2 of us. All I can say is: Nami, please visit your competitors and you will know you have lots to improve on. Providing fresh food with decent cooking is not enough because for the prices you charge, that is a basic requirement

The restaurant decor is modern with 2 different feature walls, although nothing to shout about. Apart from the wooden Japanese sushi counter, it does not feel much like a Japanese restaurant.The staff uniform is not classy enough for a top class restaurant in a 5 star hotel. I really miss the old continental restaurant Blu; which was previously situated at the same premises, but the decor was really classy & had a nice ambience, something which Nami lacks.The food is nice but nothing special or fabulous. However, the seafood salad is rather good, the quality of the sushi is also good except that it's a little too dainty a size, especially for a male. Some chefs may apportion sushi size according to a male or female patron. The waitresses served with a smile & are really sweet about explaining not being able to give sufficient attention due to a small party going on; although I think they could use more staff cos of the crowd; we constantly have to ask for topping up of tea which was topped up with a smile. Great staff

This was my 2nd lunch but 3rd meal at Nami. Grouse: Even though my reservation was for noon, the restaurant did not open till literally one minute before noon. That's a failure in my books as any professionally run restaurant should be open in time to accept a first order at the earliest advertised operating time, which means that this restaurant should have opened its door well before noon in order to be ready to serve lunch customers.Plus points:Service- After the opening time hiccup, service was good. Courteous and attentive.Food- My lunch companion and I shared a very beautifully presented sashimi platter (portions for 2 to 3 persons), and additional order of in season juicy Akagai (Ark shell) with a main course each of Grilled Wagyu Slices on rice with truffle sauce & poached egg. The sashimi was well sliced, very fresh (the genial and helpful Restaurant Manager, Takezumi Ando told us that their fish today was freshly imported from Tsukiji fish market, Tokyo) and very delicious. A selection of Chu toro, O toro, Aji, Hamachi.The wagyu beef bowl was well executed, melding the juiciness of good quality wagyu done medium rare and grilled textures with a delicious sauce with truffle shavings. Very Umami! Verdict: Recommended and deserving a return visit. Would have rated this lunch experience excellent but took it down a place to very good due to the opening time hiccup. Hopefully, the opening time will be timely next time.

Love the dishes here! The food were awesome! Fishes are fresh. We had the tuna belly and salmon sashimi and it was really good. Everything was great! Staff was really helpful and efficient. Canâ€™t remember his name but he served us well in the private room. On overall, this restaurant is highly recommended for personal dining and business meetings

So This restaurant is right on top of the Shangrila and the atmosphere is amazing. The menu is interesting - some dishes are really worth it Eg omakase menu and some dishes seem a tad expensive - eg sukiyaki. Their best selling dish was Japanese Saga Wagyu A4 sirloin with truffle on rice. It looks beautiful in all the instantgram photos but the actual dish was a little cold ; a little not so much and not as good as it looks.

Elegant setting with beautiful views from the 24th floor of the Shangrila Hotel and marvellously delectable sushi, sashimi and sukiyaki. They have surprisingly affordable lunch sets which come with pickles, miso soup, chawanmushi, the main and ice cream. The beef sets used chuck beef done in 3 ways - sukiyaki, steak and beef strips. The unagi was superb but the chirashi and tempura were disappointing. We shared some appetisers - deluxe sushi and sashimi platters, edamame, fried chicken and Fish cake. The shrimp tempura roll and unagi egg rolls were very good too. Service was responsive and helpful.

I decided to try Nami for lunch as my wife and I were looking for a new venue for Japanese food. Reception: The door hostess (an elegantly attired and polite lady from the Philippines) warmly greeted us as we stepped out of the lift (taken from the ground floor lift lobby in the Tower Wing) onto the 24th. floor reception foyer of Nami. She showed us to our table on the right hand side of the dining space facing a panoramic view of bukit timah and environs.Menu: There is a menu for lunch which is separate from the dinner menu. Although not very extensive, the lunch menu was fairly wide with various set lunch options ranging from sushi and sashimi to tempura and some cooked food and a medium sized range of a la carte dishes like makimono, beef and cooked fish dishes, including their signature fish head. There was no Soba on the lunch menu (available on the dinner menu) but our waitress checked with the kitchen and kindly obliged my wife's preference for a serving of Soba accompanied with a mixed tempura as a la carte orders.I had assorted raw fish slices on a bed of rice as part of a set lunch which included a tiny bowl (but melt in your mouth tasty) chawan mushi and a slightly bigger (but still delicately) sized bowl of dark miso soup. My wife who was converted to a Sobalier on one of our earliest holidays to Tokyo (>10 years ago), said that it was the best Soba she has had in Singapore. She also liked the Tempura which were lightly battered and crunchy.My raw fish slices served on a bed of rice was delicious but the proportion of fish to rice could have been a little more generous but then again, it was after all a set lunch priced at @$55, which included a main, a starter (chawan mushi), a soup (miso), and pickles as well as a very zesty and tasty dessert (Uzu gelato).Ambience: As the restaurant is sited where BLU was previously, it enjoys natural daylight through floor to ceiling picture windows (if it's a sunny day, you can (as we did), ask for the window blinds to be lowered) & nice views of mostly green trees & foliage interspersed with many interesting homes, including condominiums, modern houses and even a handful of black and white colonial era bungalows.Prices: Fairly reasonable particularly for the set lunches. Our lunch for two (one set lunch & one a la carte) cost @$170.Service: Attentive and courteous throughout. We didn't need to constantly ask for our Ocha to be topped up.Conclusion: Nice spot for lunch. Fresh food, well prepared, nicely (but not fussily presented), fair portions, reasonably priced for a premier Japanese restaurant in a premier and distinguished luxury hotel; and smooth, pleasant service with a smile. Particularly suitable for lunch dates and small groups. Recommended

I chose this restaurant for the view and setting. It didn't disappoint. A seat by the window allowed me to watch the parade of clouds while enjoying the meal. We ordered a selection of items from Japanese tomatoes to tempura, sushi and cod. All were well executed. The tomato could have had more intense flavor. The prawns in the tempura were sweet but the batter was a bit too thick
