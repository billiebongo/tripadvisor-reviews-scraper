Waiting in Terminal 3 can be on occasions arduous. Needing a coffee break and some lunch we have tried other cafe's within the Terminal in the past. In the heart of Terminal 3 we decided to try Pret A Manger. Clean table, pleasant staff, very good food and coffee. Hard to beat when the coffee in Singapore can sometimes be a bit on the bitter side, as that's how it is generally served. Not today, as 2 visits to the same cafe and both times the coffee was excellent and to our taste, which other may not prefer

Maybe all the coffee in Changi is the mediocre stuff from the big chains but strong grainy coffee might be just what you need before a flight. Food is the usual sandwiches, toasties and pastries. Some of the seating is red benches looking out the windows so probably a good option in terminal 3

It is great to see Pret at Terminal 3 Changi it used to be a Costa which I donâ€™t like as much. The coffee and snacks were good and I paid with Euros as I did not have any local currency all good. This will become my regular stop off both way
