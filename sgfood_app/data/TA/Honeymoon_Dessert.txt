We stambled upon the place and since we were looking for desert we decided to try. The food was good and the place modern and clean. I would recommend it if you are in the area looking for Asian deserts.

Traditional eastern desserts place is hard to come by within a shopping mall, this dessert shop would definitely offers a good alternative eastern dessert Hong Kong style! Good varieties, clean place and well maintained.

A colleague brought me here for dessert. I tried the Almond paste tea and was pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste. Will visit again.

Poor quality and expensive. Consistently below expectation.
Hot desserts largely inferior in taste and texture.

Tasty and the price was reasonable for Singapore. We visited the Victoria Street location in Bugis Junction. They have a huge selection of desserts and ours was pretty good, mango and black sticky rice parfait. Overall it was nice for a chain restaurant.

The desserts were really nice, really fantastic. The selection is large, and the items arrive quick. The mango dumplings are one of the best things that have happened to me. MANGO DUMPLINGS.

They cam have the banana pancakes. Otherwise you have a menu with over 100 dessert choices in a mall cafe setting full of late teen / early 20s girls chilling and chatting, maybe the occasional family or date night. Price ranges from $3 something to $7 something. Very reasonable if you just want to hang "Sex in the City" like, or if you are trying to keep the date going an hour longer and want to see if she likes the taste of a little Hong Kong cream. Many dishes are heavy on durian, red bean, coconut milk and cream. This may not be advantageous in the long game. Choose carefully

Was at Ion Orchard for dinner and was walking around when we stumbled on this place. It was packed and their extensive menu that looks like an Imperial Edict of the old days. Hehe! We tried three kinds of their dessert, it was good, expensive for dessert. The mango dessert was nice but maybe is not mango season find it abit sour.The Mango with pudding, first time trying. Was acceptable, not so sweet. I enjoyed itThe durian glutinous rice. It was very good. Hope the place can comes out with a new taste with fresh mango with durian glutinous rice and black glutinous ric

I stumbled by this place while walking around ION Orchard. It seemed busy and the desserts looked delicious on display. I walk up and one of the servers told me to choose wherever I would like to sit. He gives me a menu and walks away to help other patrons. While many of them seemed good, I need some sort of mango overload and I find one that sorta fits the bill. I order and in a few minutes a server hands over something that looks like a cold mango sago soup. You can tell that they mainly use fresh ingredients as the mango “soup” was still a bit sour. It sorta hit the spot, but not a place that I would return to if I was in the area

I always go for Mango Sago with Pomelo whenever I come to Honeymoon Dessert. But the price is not so cheap for a portion like that. The service was also not so good, I came the one in ION at about 9 pm, the waitress is very slow in delivering my order and she mistakenly giving other people's order to my table. Hope they can improve their services

had the mix mango dessert with sago. overall taste was good, seems healthy. we also tried other several desserts and so far its all good.

Miss Honeymoon Desert's in Hong Kong and was happy to find one here in Singapore. Good simple and tasty deserts, nothing more nothing less! Yummy.......

This was a different and very pleasant experience for us. Really good value, so much choice it was difficult to decide. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Singapore who has not experienced Asian Dessets before.
5
Tried one of their special desserts between flights in Changi Airport. I had a little SGD to spend and we both love Asian desserts. This one was extra special and I will definitely be visiting again during Singapore stopovers.
5
I enjoyed the desserts in the restaurant. Some recommendations: Coconut Juice & Sago Grass Jelly, Coconut Grass Jellyand ice cream with Sago, Mango Pomelo and Sago sweet soup with Icecream, Mango Pancakes.
5
Went here twice in our visit to Singapore. A wide range of chinese desserts - sago, mango pancakes, puddings - you name it! Price is fairly cheap and good service. A must visit in Singapore or Hong Kong. Prices range from 3-6$

My friend who has been living in Singapore for 5 years took me to this place, and introduced me to the double-boiled milk with nuts. It was so delicious that we kept coming back (or rather I made my friend come back) every night of my stay there! The mochi and bean curd are amazing too, My favorites (other than double-boiled milk) are mango mochi and mango bean curd. Yum!One thing to note is the place can get crowded in the evening, so you might have to queue outside for a table, and the wait can be longer if you come in a group

My first visit was a few years ago at Bugis Junction branch. Subsequently, we tried the desserts at I12 Katong and Paragon outlets. They serve many kinds of Hongkong dessert and my favourite is the one with black jelly in some syrup and topped up with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Yummy! Delicious! Service-wise, we have to be patient. May be under-staff? Same situation in both I12 Katong and Paragon. We are willing to WAIT for delicious food! Can't wait to patronize Honeymoon Dessert again! :

Found this by accident and this was fantastic! I would have tried everything if I could but the thing that kept me from ordering others was I simply love and cannot forget the taste of double boiled milk with walnuts and almonds! It was absolutely scrumptious, smooth and silky all the way. Very reasonable prices for Asian style dessert!The rest I am sure would be just as good and I was so happy to see this in Changi when I left. A last time to savour before boarding

Honeymoon Desserts is the resident dessert restaurant that I visit regularly since I found it's desserts to be superior to the other HK/Taiwan dessert eateries in Singapore and every time I eat there I'm never disappointed. The prices are fairly cheap, my perennial favourite is its mango sago with green tea ice-cream. The mango puree's slight tinge of sourness complements the sweetness of the mango and green tea ice-cream perfectly and it makes for a good thirst quencher. What I love about Honeymoon is that the mango sago dessert in Singapore is of the same quality as the one I've tasted in Hong Kong, and they do not compromise on their desserts' quantity and quality. My mum loves it's durian puree and the fruits always taste fresh. Even the sweet vanilla sauce does not taste overly sweet to the point of nausea. Highly recommended
