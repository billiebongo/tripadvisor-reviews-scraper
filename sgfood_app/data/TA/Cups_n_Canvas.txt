Happen to chance upon this place. They have an area set aside for artist to draw.
I was there with my wife on a Saturday afternoon. Very quiet. Had a tea coffee and shared a brownie.
Coffee was good. Nice place to just chill.

Cool little place, good quality coffee but they were a little limited when it came to post ride muffins and pastries

We eat there for lunch.We took to menus at 5$ with a tea.The food was ok, but not enough. The tea was ok also.The place is really nice, however, with some paintings session, paintings on the wall...The service was ok, but they put the AC way to much cold, it was a bad transition between outside and inside (and compare to other places)We don't recommend to eat there, but you can give it a try it you love paintings stuf

Supposedly on a list of Best Fish and Chips in Singapore, the Fish and Fries is so terrible that I really prefer those unbranded ones from the coffee shop westerns. The carbonara is also extremely horrible - just look at the amount of oil! The fried fish had really poor thin batter and the taste of frozen fish is strong too, and the fries are soggy (worse than McDonald's).To put things into perspective:1. Chargrill / Astons2. Coffeeshop Western3. My own cooking4. Cups and CanvasExpensive and horrible quality of food. The only saving grace is their drinks - sweet potato latte is unique and decent and $8.50 (++) for a bottle of Erdinger.I'd avoid, and have my meal elsewhere

We have been here every morning for our breakfast. Lovely little place with a great chill out atmosphere. The staff are friendly and helpful. Ben's 2nd Addiction breakfast really set us up for the day, good food at reasonable price. Will definitely visit again, thanks for making us feel welcome xx

I first came here some 3-4 years ago and i'm surprised this cafe has survived the years. I had the chicken chop which turned out more like a chicken cutlet (fried) instead. I was slightly disappointed as I was trying to avoid fried food. While the food wasn't bad, it wasn't anything fantastic either. I would visit again to try the rainbow cake and simply because its quiet during a weekday lunch. The specialty really is the art jamming space next to the cafe

The cafe is understaffed and can be difficult to wait for the order if going in the morning. It is located on a busy street. The view outside is only the ongoing traffic. The food is expensive considering the quantity they give but I will no complains about the taste. I ordered the all day breakfast called The Grinch. No dissatisfaction or disappointment even after the slow service

Just opposite my yoga school. A good place to have a good cappuccino, read my newspaper while waiting for my class to start. Plays good music that I'll would enjoy at a slightly lower volume.

Breakfast arrived cold, staff inattentive all for the price of 25 dollars, I gave this a place a second chance but won't be back, seems not enough kitchen staff for there clients.

Relaxed atmosphere and yummy food. Enjoyed an English breakfast and also Pasta. Air conditioning was welcome too! Recommend

slightly quirky with a nice selection of tea and cupcakes , they have some cool art classes too worth trying

Nice cozy cafe on Selengie Road. They have quite a good selection of specialty coffee...we tried their sweet potato latte and ice blended choc mint, pretty good. Wifi is strong too.

Ordered BLT sandwich, it had 4-5 long, salty crispy bacon strips with romaine lettuce and ciabatta bread. Had no taste at all (except the salt). The side salad had no character either.I took two bites and decided not to have it (did pay for it). Then went for appetizer - bruschetta with salsa. Salsa was extra cold diced tomato, on multi-grain bread. Came with the same side of salad as the previous dish. I ate 3 of the 4 pieces to satiate my hunger. Not coming back here

Ahh, what's not to like about this place? On the recommendation of a friend, we popped in for tea on a Sunday afternoon. I had the flat white ($4.80) which was exactly what I needed - suitably strong with low acidity. We were all impressed with the texture of the sticky date pudding ($5 without ice cream, $7 otherwise) - moist and soft without being jarringly sweet. Service was good and free wifi is available. I will definitely be back for my next cuppa.

One of my go-to spot to spend a quiet afternoon alone or with companions. I love the interior where they would display the paintings by local artists. They have recently improved their menu, one of the addition, Finding Dory, was a surprise. The fish was pan-fried to my liking, and the potato wedges were not soggy. Worth trying

We tried to have a coffee and brunch on Thursday and when we went inside although the place had just one other table with two people we were not able to have a coffe or brunch. No reponse or greeting even though we said good morning, the waiter did not even bring the menus to the table after 5 minutes of waiting, so in the end we collected the menus ourselves after finding them on the bar. After 10 minutes, the waiter walked passed our table and still did not say anything and although there were 3 people working at this place and it was almost empty, no one came to take the order or explain that we had to order at the bar if that was the case. Rude, disappointing and possibly the worst service in Singapore. (The only reason why I felt the need to write this review is because they have a Tripadvisor sign at the door). Avoid waisting your time there and go to the food court next door, they have a much nicer service

I've been here many times for brunch and have always thought that it is overpriced. What took the cake was that I went for dinner and ordered a soup which cost 6.90++ band they only served half a small bowl/ big Mug. And the staff said that it was a lot of soup. Both my partner and I were hungry after our meals

cute little place with good coffee and yummy food.
the staff are friendly too
I especially like their breakfast canvas and latte

If you're fancy to paint something this place is something for you, because you can order a drink and food or just hang in to start painting on your own canvas :) - For the drinks menu I recommend anyone the purple colored sweet potato late and for food they have a nice all day breakfast dish, they can also do that vegetarian style and add some more tomatoes and mushrooms for you. Really nice concept and very friendly staff. Would recommend it for private and even business catchups. AFAIK closed on monday

Been here many times for brunch and coffee. Small but cosy arty caf√© with great food and superb lattes! Comes with free wifi and the best part is their service! They remember their regulars by face and even their usual orders, now that's dedication to serving the people. I also luv their carrot cake

During our short stay in Singapore my boyfriend and I were looking for a place for a dinner of steak and red wine without emptying our wallets. We found this cafe by chance by walking pass. It is round the corner from Little India. The menus is very reasonably priced and I loved the concept of art cafe. They have a room they use for painting classes and the whole place is decorated with original paintings. The food was delicious, rib eye stake with potatoes, grilled cherry tomatoes and mixed leaves salad and a bottle of Portuguese red wine. The homemade a cakes were great too and I opted for Apple French cake served warm with vanilla ice cream on top. It was all very reasonably priced, I would say that it was a bargain. Very friendly staff and very pleasant atmosphere. Definitely worth a stop.

Cups n Canvas are relatively unnoticeable if you walked past it. It was recommended by one of my colleague and we decided to head there for lunch. The ambience in the cafe is great and the servers are very attentive. There are a lot of artworks displayed around the cafe and being located in the arts and heritage district, the cafe fits right in. In addition, the cafe does art jamming during the weekends so part of the cafe will be cleared during the weekends for peeps who signed up for it. If you are looking for a great weekend, nothing could be more therapeutic than making art and enjoying good food at this place. You will have to pay up front at the cashier first upon ordering. When my meal came, the portion was very generous and overall, I was very satisfied with it. Would definitely recommend this cafe to my friends if they are near the area

Visited this cafe after reading it on one of the blogs and we found it very interesting although it's very unnoticeable since we've passed by the area for many times already. The staff were very attentive and will give suggestions when asked. The place is relaxing and they have one area wherein you can try painting which is very unique. Food is great and well presented.Will be coming back here for sure!

This place is a very charming cafe. The breakfast canvas is very good value-for-money with good size portion. You'll feel right at home once you step into the cafe as the staff greets you with their inviting smile. It is also a gallery that sells work of Asian artists and it is a place where you can learn how to paint

Visited this cafe on a Saturday near Wilkie Edge and Little India after reading about it on the newspapers. Cafe was bustling but i managed to snag the sofa seats. The service was friendly and coffee was surprisingly good. There was a small section where there was an ongoing oil painting class- an interesting concept that sets it apart from other run of the mill cafes.Will definitely go back again and maybe join one of their painting classses

Such a nice place. Art on the walls, concrete floors and eclectic furniture can mean there's more focus on the look than the substance. Here, though, there's a genuine welcome from people who are keen to please and good food. The experience feels 'real', not fabricated.The menu's not big but with daily specials, a proper breakfast on offer and salads, pastas and mains I've never been stuck for something to eat. Prices are good too; and the whole experience makes it a favorite place on Sundays. Such a nice alternative to chain caf√©s

Chanced upon this little hole in the wall cafe and it turned out to be one of the cafes i will frequent! There is no service charge or tax, and the pastas come with a drink from the menu. The sweet potato latte is a little too sweet for me, but its great innovation and looks pretty. Desserts really did blow me away, and the owner, Hock, will be more than happy to recommend you what cake to get (since you won't be able to decide because they all look so good!) There's a cozy backyard with two or three tables if you need some privacy.This place plays quiet music, and occasionally has art classes and events. Great for reading, doing work, or meeting up with friends
