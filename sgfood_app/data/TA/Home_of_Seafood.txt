Chilli Crab was tasty and meaty. Service was friendly, efficient and attentive. Convenient parking at the open-air carpark just opposite the restaurant.

Food was excellent but the service of some of the younger staff members were bad & insincere. They were not able to provide answers to some of questions and forgot some of the itens we requested.

Great Halal Seafood restaurant. Had the chilli and steam crabs and both dish are great. The crab meat are fresh and succulent. The environment is ok. Parking is easy, across the road from the restaurant.

My family and I are repeated customers. Within 6 months we've come back 4 times which says a lot as we seldom dine out. There is a wide selection of food available and it never disappoints. We absolutely love the black pepper crab and house beehoon. Service staff are generally pleasant but at times we have trouble getting their attention. We also love their chilli sauce.. delicious!!

Brought my Father and Popo here for dinner on Fatherâ€™s Day Celebration.There is a carpark nearby to restaurant.The restaurant is 2 storeys with toilets and kitchen is each level.Menu is full of selection.All dishes are very tasty and delicious. The black pepper crab was huge and firm. The sea cucumbers were thick and chewy. Together with fish maw, baby abalone, mushrooms and prawns. Very fresh. Fried Rice, Tofu and La-La are full of savouring.However, the reserving of dishes are slow. Properly they thought no Muslims are fasting at my table. (My husbands and me are fasting. I am a Chinese Muslims convert).But thing which I barely can endure is the air-con. I was perspiring while I was eating

Crab meat was fresh and meaty, unfortunately the sweet black pepper sauce was a disappointment. The korean style platter, squids could have be large not the tiny. I'm glad the veggie soup and prawns back on my appetite and oh gosh thanks for that. Service was good, waitress seems to be attentive on clearing soiled plates. Might or might not coming back

It was my first experience here and I like it and will surely return for more. My sister had chosen this restaurant for our reunion Chinese New Year lunch with our siblings. All of us agreed that the dishes were delicious and it was reasonably priced. We had Lohei (vegetable salad with abalone), lobster, prawn, squids, chicken, fried rice, 2 types of cooked vegetable dishes, 2 other side dishes and desserts which cost us less than $500 for 8 pax. All the dishes came out fast except the yam hot dessert which we almost wanted to cancel, however, we have to also understand that it was the peak lunch time and the restaurant was full with hungry customers. No regrets, the yam dessert was delicious. The waitress that assist our orders was helpful and friendly too. I love this restaurant and will certainly come again. I would also recommend it to other Muslims who love Chinese Seafood

Went here for dinner. Here's what we recommend and must have if you visit:-Dry bee hoon with seafood-Wok fried cereal prawn-Mee GorengApart from that we also had our table full with these:Chilli crabHomemade yam ringPan fried de-boned chicken with special sauceHong kong kailanHouse special white bee hoonSambal fried rice with beef-Do note that the portions are quite a lot (even Small). -If you love your food spicy, please request your Chilli Crab to be extra spicy. We find it not spicy but they give generous gravy. And it is a huge crab! -The House special White Bee Hoon comes with a bit of gravy and serving is a lot.Overall food is ok. We would prefer it to be spicier so if you love it spicy do make a request when you order.Good ambience and location is easy to find.Plus point..the staff are great! Very friendly staff and chefs! Food is served very fast.Thank you for the experience

Everything tasted sweet. Food came very fast.. within 5 mins , but dining Service is also not up speed. No plate changes in between and not able to refill water in time. We have to help ourselves. Overall, this is a once and never again kind of visit
