Good food from a wide menu choice. Our choices were delicious. The Yusu nabe is a choice to try. The soup is tasty with a little spicy hot towards the end.
The chicken katsu is fried just right.

Tried this Sushi Tei at Vivo City and had a Wagyu Shabu and Tempura Donburi. Just tasted so-so, even they didnâ€™t serve Japanese rice here. Well, very expensive compared to Sushi Tei in Jakarta.
4
we waited around 15 mins , the restaurant was packed. i saw this as a good sign, we ordered our dishes in an ipad everything was efficient. the food was prepared quick and fresh.
was impressed with the efficiency. food was very reasonable.
5
Had a nice lunch. My seat had a nice view of Sentosa. Ate Tonkotsu Ramen with Ebi Tempura. It was good. The soup was tasty but not salty, the noodles were tender and the tempura was fresh and crispy. Nice!

After a big day at Universal Studios we just walked over and joined the queue for some really awe sushi, fresh and well presented at a very reasonable price.
Highly recommend trying this place out. Worth the wait!

Sushi Tei in the huge mall Vivo City is hidden by the entrance. We thought it to be way smaller judged by the entrance but behind the entrance there was plenty of space and even sushi belt (which unfortunately we didnt take). Orders are given by typing them into tablet which rests on the table and swoosh order is at the kitchen. We were delivered drinks we had typed into order before we even had finished the order. So dont expect the waiter to come to take your order. Sushi was good but nothing too fancy nor too artistically set up. Prices were very ok. View is nice to the river (pond?) at least from the tables near the windows. We enjoyed

We recently had a weekday lunch as a family here. It'd been a number of years since I've eaten here, so I was interested to find out if there had been changes since. I looked back at my previous review and interestingly, there was a Hokkaido seafood offer both then and this time round. I have to say that the quality of the food, while not brilliant, was still pretty good - tasty without being overbearing, with offerings that remain a notch (or more) above other similar chain Japanese restaurants. Coupled with a classier interior decor, it all adds up to a heftier sum when the bill is tallied. And do look out for 1-for-1 offers for food or drink items. Overall, it's reasonable value for money if the quality of the experience is valued

We were there at around 1.30pm Friday and there was still a short queue form outside the restaurant (despite it was almost after the lunch rush hour). We joined the queue and enquired about the approximate waiting time, and got a frustrated reply from the female middle-aged staff at the door who said that it all depended on how fast the customers eat! After 15mins, we were shown to our table, and we realized that there were many empty tables (some unclean) inside the restaurant, so we were puzzled why we were made to wait in a queue. Then there's more. The waiter forgot our sodas and it arrived only at the end of our meal. The soft shell crab maki that we ordered was hard and dry and distinctly almost stale. We are definitely NOT going back there again.

This Japanese restaurant is very nice, it has a moving track with small plates you take yourself, and you get charged according to the number of plates you've taken. The food was very interesting, fresh, however it really depends on where you are sitting, because some dished just don't make it to you if you don't sit at the beginning of the track..

I went here for a lunch time meal but I had ordered mine off the menu due to my dietary needs. For those who can eat Sushi there were plenty of delicious choices on the Sushi train to choose from. The meal I had was average and one of my selections waiting for another portion was forgotten and eventually I ended up with some vegetarian fry rice. When I was there the place was very busy and we had to line up waiting for a seat. It is also a very popular place and I can recommend it for people who do not have any dietary concerns. For those of us who do have dietary needs depending on what you can have and can't have it probably would be better to avoid any eating area that does not properly provide food to cater for your needs
4
Sushi Tei is a Singapore owned chain but the food is well above average and very good value. This location is nicely situated with views over the Harbour toward Sentosa.
Staff are unfriendly but get the job done. Gets busy at lunchtimes.
3
Their sashimi serving is quite generous and tasted fresh! Value for money. Service wasn't that awesome.
4
Sushi is fresh and good. It is a pain though if you go during weekends as you'll have to queue. But the food is nice and consistent. Reliable good quality.
3
Pros :
Attentive staff despite large crowd.
Food recommendation.
Speedy food served.
Cons:
Rice are hard both in dragon sushi n in the bowl of rice.
4
Longer than usual waiting time due to the post holiday crowd. Seasonal promotion of "Winter Treasures" menu is a delight on top of the regular fare we are so used to. The friendly staff, clean environment and prompt service is top notch!
3
This sushi tei is very popular with queues during lunch time and weekends. The decoration is one of the nicest as some of the tables have the sea view that overlook Sentosa. The sashimi is fresh and the portions are decent. One of the better chains
4
One of the early pioneers in the Japanese food chains in Singapore, Sushi Tei has many outlets across Singapore. Quality of food has went down over the years as other competing restaurants popped up, but they are still above average food, though it could be cheaper given the new competitors price points
4
This is one of our favorite haunts for Japanese food. It also has a splendid view overlooking Sentosa if you happen to have a table near the window.As stated by some, prices may not have risen much over the years but portions may have shrunk on the other hand. We used to order grilled hamachi cheek, but as the portion offered has grown small, we dropped this and cook it ourselves.We arrived at just before 8 pm on a Sat night and we had to queue a bit. We ordered the premium unagi don, salmon sashimi and 1 bowl of rice. Both were excellent ! Someone here complained about the rice. If it's not good, you should complain as it's $2 per bowl
4
Been to a lot of sushi tei but this is still the best among all. Staff are nicer than the other ones and adequate that you don't have to wait a long time for service.staff would also try to place the food down instead of dumping it on the table. Food wise have always like the dragon rolls or the salmon skin roll. Sushi is cut thick enough but not sliced so thin that you don't taste it. Cooked food choices is enough as they have cold noodles to hot noodles or rice bowl with meat or salmon
3
The Restaurant is looking a bit jaded with tiles popping out of the walls where we sat, held in place with duct tape. Food was alright but a bit generic compared in the past where you could be assured of a pretty good meal. At these prices you don't expect stellar service but certainly don't expect one of the senior staff (based on uniform) to be calling a colleague from across the restaurant by waving a table cleaning rag, right beside our table too... has seen better days in terms of decor, food and service. Still one of better places that serves Sushi in VivoCity but would not go out of my way to visit again
3
Very busy and not so friendly staff. Won't be going back when there are so many other restaurants around
5
This is one of the Japanese restaurants that serves fresh sashimi. This outlet at Vivo is quite big. I had a late lunch but it was still crowded. Service was friendly and efficient.
4
Wide range of menu options from fresh sashimi, sushi platter to ramen and don range. I like how they have seasonal menu that presents varied options like the Hokkaido ramen for winter. Go during weeknight to avoid crowding and long wait.
5
I must say that I have had the chance to eat better sushi at Sushi Tei in Singapore than in Tokyo.
The quality of the food is always great, never had a complain.
4
Sushi Tei always never fails to disappoint me! High quality and fresh ingredients are used to make each type of sushi! The only downside is we have to spend some time queuing for food.
4
Sushi Tei is one of three well known branch sushi/Japanese places dotted around Singapore. It is definitely the most pricey out of the three, a meal for three can cost around SGD$80-100. That being said, if you're eating with a group of friends or family that are usually split for choice, this is really the place to be. The variety on the menu is almost a little overwhelming, but they serve the majority of their food to the standard that you'd expect for the price. My only complaint would be the salmon shio. For anyone who's travelled to Japan, salmon shiozake or salt cured salmon is an extremely common breakfast dish. On more than one occasion I've ordered this very simple to make dish, and the fish has been served a bit bland and overcooked. For a place of this standard where the freshness of their sashimi is always super, and the rest of their dishes are so greatly made, I'm let down by the slacking in this department
4
I always enjoyed eating at this Sushi tei outlet. I find that it is more delicious compared to a few i tried. My recommendation will go for the garlic fried rice, sushi roll, salmon mentaiyaki, and the fried oyster is good too. The one shown in the picture is avocado ell, rolled with shrimp. The other one i have forgotten. It has salmon crisp in it. Have a try.
4
this place is like McDonald is for burgers , it is a big chain in south asia and offers standard okay quality sushi for okay prices... you wont regret being there neither would you crave this place. However the salmon belly sashimi was incredibile. Sea urchin (uni) had to go back since it was not fresh at all
5
Maybe I will start with a negative point: I think their food is addictive ... we keep coming back. And a more general remark: although I should be used to "the" Singapore service after more than 3 years, it's something I could repeat in 95% of all restaurants I think, something to work on. Not to say that service is bad here, or in most places in Singapore, it's just so business like, so cold, so impersonal.Good, friendly, warn service will make a HUGE difference and will make your restaurant stand out in Singapore.I guess we come here at least two times a month. We do have our favorite dishes and every now and then we add something to our carousel. It all comes at a very decent price.We will, be back
5
Finished a mornings shopping mission and on way back to Sentosa stopped at VivoCity.Found this fabulous Japanese with a menu to cater for all.Just wanted a light snack and a soup and this was perfect.Don't be deceived by the informality - food was great and timely.More importantly we did not feel rushed despite a que for tables.Will definite return.Handy to MRT so easy to get anywhere from here relatively fast.Recommend ++
5
Shopping all day at Vivo City. Decided to stop in here for lunch. No waiting time and we twere aken to our seats overlooking the water. Food was great. Ordered some dishes from the menu and choose some from Sushi Train.
5
Had to wait in line for more than 30-40 minutes but it was definitely worth it, especially the salmon flower dish.
4
Queue was long. Food was good. Service was fast and attentive. We ordered salmon fish head ship, and lots of maki to go with the fish head. We tried fried salmon fish skin too.
Fun place to have japanese cuisine.
4
The restaurant offers variety of Japanese cuisine with reasonable prices. Average spending per person is about $20 to $25.
4
I am a fan of Sushi Tei. Today I went to the restaurant with my family again. I'm my personal opinion, quality of food is more superior than Sakae Sushi. Though the price did not increase (if I remember correctly), the size of items had shrunk. Items such as Inari - amount of rice has reduced; Nabeyaki Udon - amount of udon is lesser and the size of Ebi Tempura has also reduced in size; Meat Gyoza - now become smaller, etc. Regular customers like us will surely notice even if such innovative cost saving measures are applied. You may now need to order more items to get the same level of satisfaction which would mean more spending is required. Nevertheless, I will continue to patronage as the quality of food is still worth the visit.
4
So many times been here from dine in and takeway. Must try menu Sushi Tei Salad dressing sushi tei and chili crab my most favourite one. Nice spot. Well its always packed at weekend. The minus thing was just you need to pay for tissue. It's common in Singapore. But felt so odd for Indonesian LoL. Overall, high recomended resto for Sushi.
5
We stayed 3 days in Sentosa but we came to dine here 4 times. The variety offered was plentiful. I would say it has the best Japanese food and I kept coming back for more. We have tried other outlets but somehow it taste better here. The staff were quite friendly and helpful. Highly recommended to those who like Japanese cooking
5
This is a great restaurant for people that love Japanese food but do not necessarily know all kinds of dishes. Menu is very well explained, with photos of each option which makes the choice very easy for foreigners. There is a big variety of options, dishes are well prepared and delicious. Home sake is also something particular and I recommend trying
4
It was my first time to this restaurant. There is a wide selection of sushi and Japanese food. My Ten Don was very delicious and so were other dishes. We had a wait for a while to get some of our food. Servers were everywhere which made it easy and quick to get drinks or help. A must try
4
after searching a while for the sushi place id love, this place just made me happythe atmospehere is nice, looking out on to the bay area with the cruise ship center in view, its nice to watch the huge cruise ships pass by.the sushi bar is nice sitting with marble tables. staff were nice and welcoming and helpful I ordered the soft shell crab maki with salmon caviar. i give this one 5 stars !also ordered the prawn tempura maki "special" that was great too. i give it 4.5 stars 
4
Great Japanese restaurant at reasonable prices. Service is good, food is delivered in a timely manner and tastes great. Well worth the visit.
and
5
My husband and I love this place for Japanese food. I love their salmon Teriyaki and maki. Try their ramen too, it's filling and delicious. Try to get a seat near the window for more light.
5
There are plenty of sushi chains in Singapore and we go to several each time we visit. However, we were really impressed with Sushi Tei as not only is the food fresh, they are also well-presented. The service was good and when we made a wrong order by giving the wrong number, they happily exchanged it for the right one even though they had already prepared the initial one. The price is reasonable for sushi but it can get busy during lunchtime. The view across was fantastic. Overall a very good meal
4
I very much prefer eating in individual restaurants over a branch of a chain or a franchise.For a chain which risked losing sight of serving good food over expansion, Sushi Tei managed to get a 4/5 rating from me.I like their interesting sushi offerings: fresh ingredients, tasty, good variety to try out.However their sukyaki slices I had on my last visit (early Sep) were really fatty that we only ate half of it (and we ordered 2 sets as there were 8 of us).My family and I often ate at the branches in Raffles City and VivoCity - both branches were always crowded and noisy, and we often had to remind the service staff about refilling our glasses (for water or ocha) several times
4
Visited Sushi Tei at Vivocity while recently staying on Sentosa. The restaurant was popular with us queuing for a table for about 20 minutes on a Saturday evening. The restaurant is modern, with a view of the water facing Sentosa Island.The menu offered a wide variety of Japanese food which was reasonably priced. We had miso, gyoza, sushi roll, tempura, wine and beer for SGD 65 which we thought was good value.The service was good, my only negative is that the gyoza was cold and had not been cooked properly, once we advised the staff they got us a fresh batch no questions asked.We enjoyed a nice meal and it's somewhere I'd recommend for some good Japanese food
3
The food at the various Sushi Tei outlets is remarkably consistent - reliable and good-value - so the same goes for this one. However, the dining experience at the Vivo City branch must be one of the worst: there is always a queue; service is substantially below par (table badly cleaned after last customers left, still wet with plenty of fish roe; orders forgotten; etc); dated decor (quite rustic compared to Ngee Ann City and especially Paragon branch). Since there are plenty of dining options at Vivo City (including Japanese), I wouldn't come here again. The membership scheme is excellent value, join but use it at other branches
5
Do come here early as there is always a queue going into the restaurant. If possible try to get a window seat facing Sentosa. Are around 8-9pm you will be able to see a short firework display (Crane Dance) which is really a nice way to end the dinner.Food is nice but may need to wait a while for food to be served
5
Just had lunch at sushi tei vivocity and it was a bit difficult to choose sushi and nigiri due to the big variety that the restaurant offers. I had king prawn mango sushi which was unique and deliciois with a touch of sweet and savoury, octopus nigiri, and crab meat nigiri. I would recommend to have chilli mayo as a side dip for the nigiri. Enjoy guys and pamper your taste buds.
4
Come to eat here again after a few years due to always long queue.We oder some sushi like inari, kani corn and tamago sushi as they are my son favourite. The sushi taste nice and different with those cheap oneTheir wagyu burger is our favourite. Meat so tender and juicy.Chicken katsu don that we oder also taste nice.For us their chasu ramen taste just so so. We choose tonkutsu soup but the soup too watery. If we come back to this restaurant definitely willNot order their ramen.Strawberry ice cream inside a waffle also taste nice FOC ocha Service staff quite friendl
4
Visited this restaurant for dinner while we put our kids and singkids. Managed to secure seats at the sushi bar without the kids. It's fun and a pleasure to watch the sushi chefs at work while eating fresh sashimi. Ordered the mekajiki, maguro and sake for both sushi and sashimi. They were fresh and flavorful.Service was quick and appropriate though the restaurant was packed
4
Sushi Tei has a huge selection of delicious Japanese food including desserts. A very attractive dining place for adults & families. It also has a good system of serving customers. A definite must-try.
4
We order toro sashimi, fry oyster and tempura, all are very good. Must try when you are in Vivo City......
3
During shopping we went into this sushi bar, we set at the sushi belt, so service was no problem. Sushi quality was average and offering was not too broad
3
We are some sushi there today. It was okay...not extremely good. The price is fair though.
Note to staff: please clean (or at least sweep) the floor during the day. It looked as if a food fight had been going on earlier. Not very appealing.
3
we just love to eat here cause the food is fresh and the price is reasonable. If you are a member, you can collect the points and deduct some money from the bill the next visit. On your birthday, month you get further discount. They also have seasonal dishes which are not available throughout the whole year. So try them and discover what you like to eat
4
We often eat here for a quick dinner if we need to go shopping at Vivo City and love it! Although there is regularly a line-up outside once you go through the bamboo doors service is excellent - dishes always come out in a flash, waiters are very attentive to drink refills etc. The sushi is very good and I would highly recommend the meat gyoza - always a favourite when we take friends! A must try if you are at Vivo City
4
I eat here quite often with friends. The sushi is good for Singapore and the price. We especially love the Dragon roll. The restaurant itself is pleasant - you can either sit at a table, some of which overlook the harbour, or at the sushi bar (you can still order from the menu when sitting at the sushi bar). Service is fast and efficient.I will inevitably visit again. The queue can be long, but moves fairly quickly
3
I am one who values dining experience more than the food, the long q made me skipped this place fir years but I got to Vivo really early and there is no q. Mate wanted to try Japanese food, so we give it a shot. Service is pretty good and speedy inside and quality is not there though (dont understand why the line) there are better outlets who could do better salads, sushi and soup aka Paragon branch is still the best.
5
We had lunch at Sushi Tei in Vivo City on a crowded Saturday afternoon. We were seated at a table facing the windows with a partial view of Sentosa Island and visitors going up the stairs to get a panoramic view of the harbor. Tables by the windows are limited, but they add to the experience. The service provided by our waitress was excellent. She was busy but efficient. We have tried agedashi tofu at many restaurants, and we felt the agedashi tofu here was at least a B+. Only one dish on the menu was prepared in aburi style-the salmon sushi--but it was excellent and highly recommended. The aburi blowtorching brings out more of the salmon flavor. Our unagi special sushi was very good with a lot of unagi meat. Our favorite dessert was the black sesame ice cream. We also had two other varieties: strawberry and mille feuille ice cream and cheesecake ice cream. Every dish was well prepared. The price was reasonable considering the high quality of the food, the service on a busy day, and the view. We recommend Sushi Tei for those who want a lunch that they know will be delicious and satisfying
5
The sushi was amazing, the sashimi tasted and looked fresh, nice atmosphere and friendly staff! Amazing.... I recommend you to eat the Jo unagi, the tei yaki and the sashimi 3 ways: Bluefin tuna, salmon (next one I forgotten). One of the best sushi tei outlets by far
4
In all cuisine, quality and freshness is prerequisite and expected ...
Above combined with good culinary spells heavenly concoction ...
Am always back for more ... but do expect long queues and waits due to overwhelming customers
4
Never been to japanese restaurant before but Sushi Tei change my taste. They really maintain original taste of Japanese taste. Must dine there.
5
Loved this place. Great value, great food and we were lucky enough to score a table overlooking the harbour at Vivo City. Highly recommend if you are a Japanese food love. The crab salad and prawn tempura are great.
4
Sushi tei vivo city has the nice outside view.
Good location.
The food is typical sushi tei, clean and reasonable.
Average high in the menu's price.
Good place to hang around before going to sentosa island.
4
Besides Italian food, Japanese food is also one of my favorites.Went here plenty of times already in cities in Indonesia and Singapore, and the quality of service and food are always as expected.My all time fav is the simple yet addictive miso siru soup, and any salmon based sushi and sashimi. Service is always prompt and good. Do take note though, during lunch time, the restaurant located at Vivo City is always full with people lining up in queue. Hence, if you don't want to squeeze yourself with the crowd, you may better come earlier or later past lunch time. Unless of course, if your lunch time given from your company is strictly 12 pm to 1 pm :pRegardless, do come and enjoy the fresh and original taste of Japanese food here at Sushi Tei!
5
Loved this place (so much so that we went to the Paragon shopping centre branch of Sushi Tei too later in our holiday).That was some of the best sushi and sashimi we've ever had, and my youngest daughter is still raving about the chicken katsu curry.Couldn't fault it at all - great service, great food. And the queues stretching away from the door suggest that others agree
5
I'm going to start with my summary; Sushi Tei offers the best 'bang for you buck' Sushi and Japanese Cuisine when weighing up value for money, quality and service. I absolutely love this place and am yet to meet anyone who has had a bad experience here.A few of our friends from Europe are visitng Singapore for work and we took them to Sushi Tei at Vivo City. We got a table with a fantastic view of Sentosa Island behind us with the skilled suhsi chef's and open view kitchen to our right.In addition to lashings of hot green tea we ordered a plethora of sharing dishes including multiple Crab Gyoza, Chicken Karage, Crunchy Tuna Sushi, Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab, Dragon Rolls, Fried Squid, Mixed Sashimi Salads and Octopus Balls all of which were mouth watering delicious. The volume of food was outrageous but between 5 of us and after several hours of continous consumption we managed to deplete it all. In addition we ordered a variety of Japanese ice creams and deserts none of which dissapointed. My personal favourites from the Sushi Tei menu are the Mixed Sashimi Salads with Sesame dressing, Chicken Karage (deep fried chicken) with the homemade Mayo, Soft Shell Crab and the Dragon Roll. If you're inclined to order a more personalised main dish the Japanese Style Chicken Curry is a winner. In total the final bill came to around 280 Singapore Dollars (approx 140 GBP) which worked out at 28 GBP per head. For 2 hours of non-stop fine Japanese cuisine this is excellent value for money especially when compared to some of the other Japanese restaurants and chains in Singapore. 5 out 5 without a doubt
4
I have always been wanting to pay a visit here. It is located near Charles & Keith on 2nd floor in Vivo City. I am assigned to have a seat close to the window and have a cozy view of green and sea. I had ordered one minced tuna rice (SGD 10.5) and one tea pot soup (SGD 6.8) for myself. Foodies here are fresh, not big portion but decent in size that enough for one. It definitely serves a nice environment and food for Japanese food lovers! I highly recommend this place and I would love to return here again :)
5
Had a great experience. The sushi was delicious and reasonably priced. We had nine rolls and every one of them was devoured. Even my inlaws who "dont like sushi" enjoyed it. I would recommend a table at the back of the restaurant for the great view of the waterfront.
5
Some of the best Japanese food I have had in a long time and great value too. The sashimi salad with sesame dressing is gorgeous, melt in the mouth baby octopus and the soft shell crab with fish floss is amazing. I could go on through the menu, I loved it all. Definitely worth a visit
5
I love the conveyor belt sushi - this one we sat up at the bar and watched it go around - huge menu selection - take off the train and/or order from the menu. Beautifully fresh and reasonably priced
4
Great place, quick service, good food, reasonable prices and guaranteed us the sushi overdose we were craving for during our two week trip. Wine prices were steep but wine everywhere in Singapore is expensive.
3
This is your usual Japanese Restaurant. Food wise, its pretty good, above average. The price is competitive as well. The interior is ok, don't expect too much for the ambience. However, this is one of the better place to have your regular japanese fare.
4
Great find in Vivo City! Fresh and yummy japanese food with Robatayaki. I'd recommend this restaurant to foodtrippers with great palate like me.
4
The Katsu Curry was good, try to get a table that faces the waters, the view is lovely.
4
Slightly better than usual quality of food served but service is the same. Not bad but not exceptional. Nice sea view if you can get it.
3
Love their Otoro...But the food is expensive
4
I love the Rainbow roll, and sashimi salad. The services are fast and good. I will visit again.
4
I've always preferred Sushi Tei over other chain sushi establishments and would have gone more often if not for the fact that the food's not cheap and the service often just average. But the quality of the food was evident when I had dinner during the restaurant's recent Hokkaido seafood promotion. Enjoyed some of the more interesting and tasty cold dishes. Best to go with several friends for a better atmosphere. At this branch, try to get a table near the windows for a terrific night view of Sentosa Island
3
We had lunch in this resto coz we are craving for japanese food. The food taste was great indeed. We had ramen, udon, grilled eel, tempura, maki, sushi... One downside of this resto is that they have too many guests that the service is quite slow. We ordered 4 cups of rice but we ended having it almost at the end of the eating and it was just 2 cups. Inaccurate order served. But anyway, we enjoyed the food
