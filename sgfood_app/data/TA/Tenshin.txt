The best tempura restaurant in Singapore !
The tempura are fried to perfection. The food are fresh , seasonal and creative.
Personally prefer Tenshin to Ippoh in Osaka.

The food is fine but not great or even good, the ambience and service is great. It's a partial show as we sit at the counter.

Dined here when staying in the Regent. Not familiar with the cost of good tempura but the prices ranged from $20 for a side to $180 for a one person meal. Considering this is basically a few pieces of fish and vegetables it is certainly on the expensive side, but overall the food was very good. The service was attentive, although I found it off putting that one of our servers continuously sniffed her nose loudly when serving us. The batter was very light and the food fresh

Staying at the Regent it was an easy decision to choose the Tenshin the day I checked in, which proved to be an excellent decision. The food was very good, supported by an excellent service. Interesting variety of appetizers including sashimi, shirako and ankimo all fresh and well presented, followed by a variety of fish and vegetables tempura. Averagely expensive but highly recommended, especially if one stays at the Regent. I actually visited it twice during my 3 day stay in Singapore!

We came here for lunch on a Saturday. Last order was at 2pm and we made reservations for 1.45pm, turned out to be a good decision as the restaurant was not busy at that time.The tempura was very well prepared, the batter was light, not greasy and ingredients fresh.Servers were attentive.You can have a good meal for upwards of S$40 per person, excluding alcohol, and the meal comes with complimentary dessert

This was one of the time when I looked forward to finishing my meal despite paying much more than I should (>$373). 2 cardinal rules were broken here. 1) There is no Japanese Chef here, they are all born not more than 100km from the restaurant. 2) Chef and staff drank (a lot) when offered by customers. No wonder service was horrible despite being overstuffed in an under utilised restaurant, and the great pity is I Guess if a real Japanese Tempura Chef was present the food and service would have been very different. We would never come back here again.

I have not been back for almost 10 years to this exclusive tempura restaurant at The Regent Hotel. I am impressed that they have maintained their high standards where the cooking oil is always fresh & each dish is prepared ala minute. It's never rushed. Only negative comment: the floral arrangements needs to be further sharpened. The flowers seemed rather sad.

I am not a huge fan of Tempura, simply because it is one of those things that you can find everywhere. But this one is different. Even though it is deep fried, the taste is very light and not oily. Reservation is recommended since the place is very small

I'm a Tempura lover, and I have tried this dish in restaurants in New York, Tokyo and Manila. I decided to try the tempura in Singapore, particularly Tenshin given the good reviews. The service was efficient, and the ambiance ok, considering this was inside a Four Seasons hotel. The Tempura was very good, though I'm not sure it's really worth that price. If I compare this to the Tempura Ive tasted in Tokyo, I suppose it's close to authentic. If it's value for money, I'm satisfied with our Tempura in Manila restaurants like Kimpura

Service is good, food is bad, had two meals, one average and the other dreadful. Chicken dish was burnt, and was mainly bones and skin. The food really needs to be improved as the hotel is lovely, will not eat there again

Tempura was great.. But prawn was too small üòÅ and find the menu overpriced.. üç§üç§üç§
Place is good and crew was attentive.

Decent tempura, but not great - at least for someone who has lived in Tokyo. Some of the tempura appeared a bit undercooked. I guess you could call it overpriced, but it is only mildly so, at least for a large hotel restaurant in Singapore. One would, however, expect better table seating for the price, and not a counter along a bar. (The place appears to have only three tables)

been going there for many years and the 2 chefs at the tempura counter has been producing the best tempura in singapore .. the waitresses are very efficient too . Mainly Japanese clientele in the past , words got around and Singaporeans who are in the know Have found tenshin an excellent place to dine .. lunch menu is slightly cheaper

Hi if you love tempura you must come to TENSHIN. The chef makes very delicious tempura and the oil the restaurant uses is very healthy, you see the tempura infront of you on the paper is not oily when served. All ingredients are fresh and most of the food in the menu you ordered are sooo delicious it just melts in your mouth. If you have not try you MUST come to this restaurant..is the BEST tempura ever if you really like the authentic taste from Japan. After my visit here my tongue only accept TENSHIN tempura. LOVE LOVE LOV

Came here for lunch today and just loved the tendon... I have came to this restaurant quite a few times in the past and Tenshin definitely has the best Tendon and Tempura around. Very consistent in taste and presentation... Very delicious and very tasty as well... Loved it

A last minute decision saw us turn up at Tenshin for lunch on a Saturday without a reservation. We've been for several dinners in the past and while the restaurant clearly has its regulars, it's normally never packed to capacity. We were therefore stunned to see the restaurant had been booked out. To the credit of the wait staff, we were swiftly seated after agreeing to keep our meal to one hour.We ordered one tempura lunch set and one tendon set (see menu pictured). Both were tasty, prepared with care and served with pride. For those unfamiliar with this restaurant, they specialise in tempura and do not serve other kinds of Japanese food.The restaurant is housed in a minimalist, quietly contemporary interior space that is well lit. You are seated either at sturdy wooden tables and chairs or at counter on comfortable wooden chairs where you can watch the chefs cook each tempura serving. We think the space is probably designed to help the customer appreciate the food on the plate without the distraction of loud decor or music (none is played). Service throughout our meal was efficient and professional. Our tea was always topped up and our dishes cleared with quiet efficiency that did not disrupt conversation. The lunch sets are pretty good value for the quality of the food and service. Dinner is a more elaborate and expensive multi-course meal.

Haven't been here for a long long time. Looks like the prices are lower, not cheaper. Less tempura at lower prices. Highest lunch set is $75. Just enough food.This set has prawns with prawn heads, vegetables and fish. Also comes with a bowl of rice with chopped up prawns and a generous sprinkling of sesame seeds. There's also a bowl of miso soup and a vegetable starter.Still a very good meal after all these years.Tempura here is lightly coated with batter so you can taste the food and not just the batter

Food itself was great. It's probably the best tempura in town - you can hardly find something else at the same level. The seafood used was very fresh, except the prawn was a bit small for a tempura. Sea urchin tempura wrapped in seaweed was amazing. The slightly warmed up creamy and liquid texture of the urchin, combined with thin, hot and crispy seaweed, was something you can only find in paradise!In all, the flour paste was thinly coated. Timing was perfect so that tempura was not oily at all since the coating prevents oil from entering inside. The con is, it's very overpriced. In addition, I didn't have the all the courses indicated on the menu. I didn't have salad and dessert. I also had less vegetable dishes (only 3 compared to 5 on the menu). The whole Omakase included 5 seafood tempura, 3 vegetable tempura, 2 appetiser (squid and tofu), 1 bowl rice. The bill was $480 for 2 pax. Considering the material it used, it's way overpriced. You can get a full Omakase with better materials for 2 pax in $300.Anyway, the food was great. So I guess sooner or later I have to pay such a bloody bill for its title - the best tempura in town.

 Cosy restaurant specialising in very fine gourmet tempura. Very pricey too so don't try this restaurant if you're wanting a hearty value for money meal!The tempura get served piece by piece to be savoured with the tempura sauce and radish or the 4 different flavoured salts. The Umi tempura was memorable as were the tomatoes. We had the prawn and sesame rice at the end. Tasty but ask for some soy sauce to go with it. The clam soup is rich with a strong flavour. They have wonderful juicy honey dew to end the meal but it's the exclusive Jap type so very expensive.
