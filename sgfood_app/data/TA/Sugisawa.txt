They serve good Asian food at affordable price. Their Teriyaki Salad was sooo good. Went back two times. Very close to Robert Quay Hotel.

To call this place poor would give poor restaurants a bad name. This was more deplorable.I ordered the special of the day, garlic wagyu beef fried rice. I initially thought it was a joke as the serve was so small and devoid of any beef.Anyway, it sat on the table while tables around us were served (15-20min) and waitresses played on their phones, before my partner's main arrived.That too was entree size at $30.In total the bill arrived at SGD 100.I've eaten out a lot, and in many different places however this by far takes the cake for the worst dining experience.So many restaurants in this area. Surely there are better

Family of four out for dinner. We started with sashimi and it was awesome! The other dishes included karage, tsukune, grilled cod, and tempura moriawase. All dishes were very good. The happy hour one for one Asahi beer was duly appreciated. Overall a very pleasant experience with very attentive servers

Visited this restaurant a couple of time for dinner. Robertson Quay has many restaurants serving excellent cuisine but sometime you just wanted to have some comfort food. For me, this is the place to be. Decent bento at reasonable price. They do have something more exquisite too such as The Jewel Box where they serve three types of Sushi decorated with dry ice. Very well presented.

Had a family dinner here but left very disappointed. The serving sizes were tiny (the $10 squid had 6 x 2 cm fried "bites"). These were nice enough, but pretty sparse tapas... Similarly the prawns and satay were limited (and not clearly appetisers!). The noodles arrived as we were asking for the bill - we'd forgotten about them too! And to make it worse, it was like you were really putting the staff members out when you asked for a spoon or something else minimal. Must only be able to survive because of the heavy passing tourist traffic

This restaurant is well worth a visit. I brought my dog-we were welcome to sit outside, and the dog was well behaved-so no issue. The chef has recently changed, so the restaurant is renewed. They still serve family style and wholesome Japanese food; also excellent sashimi, and a good regional as well as seasonal selection of food. They will tell you (and show you) which fish is fresh; i had a delicious grilled fish yesterday

I was being dragged to the place by friends because I just return from Osaka and Kyoto not long ago and is still dreaming of their food. Was so excited to see the word Osaka and Kyoto on their menu, but was rather deterred by the pricing.Service was prompt, friendly, but none like a Japanese establishment. Felt more like we were dining at a local cafe or a coffeeshop under the Housing Block in the heartland.Cold towels were handed to us being placed on the table, without a tray. I don't like it, but maybe that's just me.The worse bit came when one of the beer was served with lipstick mark on the mug. When one of us went for an exchange, the wait staff returned with a new beer exclaiming - maybe the colleague had wanted to kiss my friend.An uncalled for remark to come from a restaurant's wait staff. If we were in a pub, maybe.One of the dishes was served with a caution from the wait staff that it's very hot, for it's just being done up. While we handled the dish with extra caution, expecting it to be piping hot, the inside of the food turned out to be cold. Icy cold. After a while, it became soggy.After some explanation and relay of message by the wait staff from the Japanese chef that it is supposed to be prepared this way, it was being waived off the bill.The Roll Sushi was not done with skill. We had some fun time competing with one another to see who is the one who could hold one up without everything dropping out and falling apart. After a while, we figured it was rather unfair because they were of different cuts and sizes, so we dropped the game.To my knowledge and experience, Japanese cuisine is all about Passion & Precision, some were even considered as an art. I won't comment about prices because each business would have their own concern.But today, if my meal was being served on a travellator, I'd probably finish eating everything without saying a word. This place really have a lot of room for improvement.I rated average because their sashimi is very fresh. Portion is reasonable. And, for me, fresh food is the topmost importance for every single Japanese restaurant because some are to be served raw. If not for this, I'd probably aim a little lower.OH! Their Menchi Katsu was very nice. In fact, it was the only dish on the table that everyone praised. This particular dish was recommended by a different wait staff at a later time.Probably won't return

Have patronised this restaurant for more than 20 years. Owners have retired , i recalled mdm chan who gave excellent service and always welcomed us no matter the time gap from previous visit. The chef who was the owner gave excellent service chatting with us in Japanese. The new team not only gave us bad service, was even rude and presumptuous when ordering. Disappointing, another jewel gone. Food standard has dropped too, the chef used to maintain a tight kitchen op to ensure quality of food served. Today's experience is bad :

Been to this restaurant so many times. When Japanese frequent such restaurant, it only means 1 thing-authentic. I followed this restaurant since the days it was located at International plaza long ago.Salmon fish head, fried curtle fish, something special. Other normal Japanese dish are available. Good place for family with children. My kid ordered kani Mayo hand roll which is not on the menu but the chef made it. Outdoor seating is good when the weather is cool.

I love to visit Sugisawa when ever I'm in Singapore. The food is authentic Japanese, service is quick, prices are reasonable and staff are friendly. BYO is possible too. Don't expect posh surroundings, just enjoy the range of dishes on offer and some good company
