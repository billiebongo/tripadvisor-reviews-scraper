Heard many nice things about Platypus Kitchen, so when I finally had the chance to try it out with some friends, we went for the crustacean mac n cheese.
4
Food was good, maybe just a little pricey. It was hard to get refills for our water as it was during peak hour. Otherwise, nice place to chill with friends :)
3
The food and atmosphere are mediocre. Though I am glad they are willing to hire elderly as part of the service crew.
I am unable to taste the highlights of it deserving the recommendation from Tripadvisor.
3
Went after reading good reviews. A little under expectation. The dishes were beautiful but taste was average.
Had the prawn and caviar 'laksa' spiced risotto and the mushroom linguine.
Restaurant was quiet on a Saturday afternoon.

We always enjoy visiting Platypus Kitchen because their menu is so creative, and it is in a good location that is easy to reach even when it is raining. We arrived at 8 pm and sat at a booth by the window. They offered moscato wine by the glass. It was sweet and smooth. We shared shrimp lobster bisque and pork loin with mozzarella mushrooms, mashed potatoes, and apple turmeric sauce. Both the bisque and the pork loin are recommended. We ordered cinnamon flavored mantao for dessert. Service is prompt and friendly, and the price is commensurate with the service and menu
5
The food was really delicious and healthy too! The staff - even the one with the 'trainee' badge - was eager to help, and although it wasn't a US-style service ("How are you finding things today, sir"....) the staff was accessible and helpful.I liked the fact that it wasn't too busy, and it was around the time of Sunday brunch. Location is directly across Victoria Street from Mellower Coffee; and it's part of the same complex as the Intercontinental. You can go there as a couple; as 4s; and they even have a very large table in the back for a larger group
5
Pros :+ Lasagne Pasta is Excellent+ Salmon Pasta is okay, but portion could be larger+ Truffles Fries is crispy and delicious+ Cucumber Lemon taste refreshingCons :- Lunch Set Salad is a bit too sour for my taste, but my partner totally love it
5
We had a four course set menu here, which I think was just a holiday menu, and it was delicious! I am vegetarian and there was an excellent selection for me. We really enjoyed all of our food and couldn't fault the $6 cocktails. Definitely worth a visit.
2
The menu looked good and my husband and I just wanted a quick dinner. I ordered the crustacean Mac and cheese. It would have been good except it was tepid and kind of watery. I’ve never had cold Mac and cheese before. Our server didn’t check in with us until we were ready for the check. My comment that my meal was cold just got a response that she would let the kitchen know. Poor execution and service.
4
My friend and I had executive lunch sets (shimeiji bowl, poached salmon), both with quinoa, avocados and greens. It came with drinks (a bottle of sparkling water, a pot of tisane). We paid 39.80sgd which, in our opinion, was reasonable. Service was warm and informed. Will return
4
Really enjoyed the food at a reasonable price, great flavours, nice atmosphere. Service a bit slow but friendly.
4
Pro : Food was awesome. Indoor Ambience was great.
Cons : No suggestions of what was nice for lunch, less attentive staff as coffee wasn't served despite twice reminders.
4
Wow wow wow all i can say is this is the best place ive been through in Singapore....superb ambiance and very accomodating and friendly staff's...
1
Not the easiest place to locate in Bugis Junction, this is a casual little eatery, serving fusion food. Service was fairly good. The Laksa risotto was very spicey and a tad over salted , the Angus quinoa bowl was bland, the Macaroni n cheese chicken was average but not memorable. Their drinks were creative - from anti aging to long life concoctions, and matcha latte was good. Prices are above average. Select the Brunch options if you wish to pay a little les
4
A venue bustling with predominantly younger people. We were served quickly by attentive staff. The food we chose- prawn and caviar risotto followed by steak was beautifully presented. It tasted just as good. Only minor issue-when we asked for more mustard we were told there would be charge(which was not made). Restricted but adequate quality wine list. I highly recommend this restaurant.Great value for money.
3
Atmosphere was average, food choices average and quality average... well.. when you compare it with the other amazing choices in Singapore. The menu items are mostly pasta, and didn't really feel Australian (which I assumed would be the case with the name of the restaurant). But the service was great and attentive, so that's a positive
5
Don’t be deceived by the lack of decor or lighting from the outside. This restaurant is cosy and affordable, considering its in town and I was there during lunch break mid-week.The executive lunch set comes with either soup or salad, main plate and beverage. A cool place to hang out with friends and colleagues to unwind. I also like that they had cards filled with table topics and kitchen facts to spark conversations while you wait for your food.
5
We really enjoyed our dinner there. We were 4 and all four enjoyed their meals a lot. I tried some a fusion meal which was particularly delicious. The wines too were better than expected. The only thing we can say was the AC was particularly cold
2
I tried this resto because I had walked past one week evening and it was packed so I thought it must be good, unfortunately looks can be deceiving as I dragged my Husband there on a Saturday night and it was average at best. I had the salmon bowl which I have read a lot about on TripAdvisor and firstly the fish smelled when brought out and it was a tiny piece of salmon and the caviar on top which also didn’t taste fresh with rice under, that is it, very bland and boring with some green sauce which I’m still not sure what it is. My Husband had a seafood pasta which also absolutely stunk when brought out so i really question the freshness of the seafood, he said it was OK but wouldn’t order again and wouldn’t go back. Incidentally it was about 15/20 minutes between his meal being served and mine so his was stone cold before we started eating.I didn’t have dessert but to be fair they did look nice coming out of the kitchen. Service was ok, but the food was boring and quality of ingredients seemed average definitely wouldn’t go back
5
Visited this restaurant as part of my get to gather with my friends. Made the erservations by phone on the same day and it was easy breezy. We were seated in a quiete corner so we can chat. There are two things going for this delightful restaurant: The food and the service. The food was delectable, portions were generous and the price affordable. Expect to pay around $30.00 including drinks with your main course. They do have set meals but we opted for the ala carte menu.The service was prompt and polite. Not too stifling, yet when we needed help replenishing the water, the staff was attentive. We had a wonderful time chatting. Highly recommended. The only thing would be the dessert. While great to look at, I did not enjoy my portion. Perhaps I had ordered the wrond dessert
5
I was impressed with the variety of food available, with different menus for lunch, dinner etc and I really liked the lunch pasta specials and the matcha latte :) would visit again!
5
Awesome place to chill with good food and ambience. Good food selection with affordable prices from $5, able to cater to different group
5
Meal was great, ambience too. My go-to place to grab a quick bite and is good for longer sit-down meals as well.
5
Good place to chill.out good ambience. Good food too . Enjoy . Service may be slow at times but its alright

I don't think I can add anything more to the multiple reviews listed on TA. Located in Bugis Junction, fronting Victoria street, Platypus offers both indoor and outdoor seating. We arrived early and service was attentive, but later the venue got really crowded and it was more difficult to ensure service. If you sit outside, it may be even more difficult. The set menu items offer a choice of options at reasonable prices, though for our visit, a lot of the mains were pasta-based. Food arrived promptly, and portions ranged from sufficient to ginormous..! House wines by the glass were very affordable, and thumbs up! plain water served without a grumble and nary a plastic bottle to be seen. The quality of the meals were generally good to excellent, and serving crew, though rushed, were reasonably responsive and friendly.Good value, will come again, though try and avoid peak periods
3
My husband and I shared the pre-fix meal for 2. The portion sizes were good, however, the food was just OK, nothing great. The service was hit or miss, we spent a lot of time looking for a server and had to remind them that we had not received our final course. It felt like most of the food was prepared ahead of time. There was a very large party in the restaurant that night and that could have been why the service was not up to par
4
We visited with friends and had a variety of dishes. The set meals were well priced and the food was very tasty and well presented. The service was somewhat patchy, with our food being delivered at sporadic intervals. It is nice to eat at the same time as your companions
5
We had a really enjoyable lunch here. The food is mostly western style but that hasn't stopped the chefs from blending in just a hint of Asian cuisine to make it even better. All the staff were extremely nice and helpful. Also, it is ideally located in Bugis Junction, so I can have two of my favourite things at once, good food and good shopping. I can't wait to go back!
4
Entertaining clients from Bangkok who were keen to try "not Thai, not Chinese". Found this place on tripadvisor and it was rated well.Menu is quite smart. Catering to Singaporean pallet with spicy and colourful dishes. Menu has option for shared menus and sets - normally a hit with locals.Service was good and surprisingly friendly. Food was good and not over expensive. Servings were modest which is good.Thanks to Maria for a job well done
5
Platypus provides a very nice and calm ambience in the midst of a tiring studying environment. It provides a plethora of food options that provides a energy boost before heading back to work. My favourite meal there is the pasta as I am able to customise it to my liking. The bubble tea is also amazing and provides a quick sugar rush in between lecture
5
Platypus NUS Food Bar is always my go-to place for food that never fails to refresh me. Mega love for the salad there!
5
Good food and good place. Went with friends but this place is suitable for people of all ages. Will visit again.
5
Really love the variety of pastas and drinks available :) tried a different one each time I've been there and they haven't disappointed! :) love the food, and it's really quite a nice chill atmosphere for a date!
5
The food there was great and at a reasonable price as we opted for the set dinner. It was packed on a Friday night and service was a little slow, but still acceptable. Good place to hang out and chill :)
4
I passed this resto in bugis area. Cannot resist aftr looking at the menu.
Ambiance, very good.
Food: everything was very good
Service: great, waiters well trained
Try this resto if u r in bugis area Singapore
4
Met a long time friend for lunch and ordered the rice bowl. Tasted great! The staff was very friendly and helpful with my stroller too. The sofa was wide and comfy, my 6mo sat beside me throughout and enjoyed herself.
2
Was there on a Friday night with my friend. Ordered 2 starters and 1 main. The main came before the starters, we then eat the main while waiting for starters. Then notice our starters seem to be served to tables around us. In the midst of dinner, servers keep asking if we have order cocktail or salad, notice that they keep serving wrong food to wrong tablePlace is nicely decorated tho.
5
Went for the first time to try out the food, ambience was great, waiters were really attentive and nice. Paid a reasonable price for the whole meal.Went during dinner time, place was packed! Ordered the pre fixe for 2 (four courses), appetizers (you get 3) were good, ribeye & truffle was really yummy, cast-iron chicken was not bad, pure chocolate lava dessert was awesome too. Guaranteed full for 2 after the meal! Would come back again to try their other dishes :
5
One of the rare places in Singapore where you can get a variety of great quality pasta, often with new adventurous flavours, and yet very reasonably priced. You can be sure what you pay for is money well spent. When I eat pasta outside, 80% of the time, it's at Platypus
5
Good place to chill out with family and your buddies. Pleasant ambient and interesting food. You can have decent conversation without yelling. The place is spaceous and you do not need to knock over other patron to get to your seats. The service staff are attentive and well trained on their menu
5
Great place to hold a birthday bash.
Ample space, nice food, and even nicer service :)
Thank you Platypus Kitchen!
4
Restaurant in a strategic location, easy to reach, serves great food with a cozy restaurant atmosphere
4
We have the dinner sets, which are affordable and filing! However pity that the dessert selection is only ice cream or pannacotta, if you do not want to add $$. Do not miss their "$6 for first cocktail" offer!
5
The ambience is nice, and the bonus was friendly and patient service.One sad part for me was the set meal part, I will prefer it to be more flexible. I am more of the veggie person while my partner was more for the meat, so we couldn't get the set because both had to have the same mains... but it's alright, the food was good overall, portion is just right for both of us
4
We went there for brunch. 6 choices on the brunch menu, which is 1 main course and a drink. Well worth the money.My friend had salmon and feta bowl, which comes with tomatoes, cucumber and rice. I had the Platypus bowl: tomatoes, bacon bits, melted cheddar, ribeye beef cooked rare (exactly the way I like it!) and rice. It does come with an onsen egg, but I opted to go without the egg.The salmon was just done! Tender, tasty and moist. I loved my order too! Real bacon bits!Very good food! Not at all salty, yet full of flavour.I would go again
4
Stumbled across this restaurant after a trip to Bugis Street night markets. The service was great and the $6 drinks promotion is a great find in the middle of Singapore! The food was of high quality and decent price. Very nice place and would highly recommend
2
They had a lunch promotion and prices were decent. However, my fish was way undercooked. The waitress had a hard time understanding the problem with that and asked repeatedly, "so you want us to cook it longer for you?".My friends' orders looked blah and they confirmed it was nothing to be too excited about
4
Went to Platypus Kitchen when they were still at level 2 with a group of friends a few years back, leaving the place thinking I must bring my husband there one day and finally did last night.We ordered the Four Signature Courses for Two to Share with 2 desserts set dinner for $88+. We were quite delighted by the chilli crab mantou, Uni & caviar risotto and the 'chophouse' ribeye cooked rare upon our request. The molten lava cake could have been better if it was warm and runny. This one isn't really warm but definitely molten
5
We where looking for somewhere for our last night in Singapore and we came cl across this lovely restaurant. The food was good quality and at a good price which we found is sometime hard to come by in Singapore. I highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area of Bugis street!
5
Had a superb dinner here and left very satisfied! Highly recommended.The manager encouraged us to try their signature rice bowls and excellent salmon dishes. The salmon was cooked to the perfect medium doneness. And the beef was twnderand flavorful.The wine list was small but had excellent choices, the new Zealand sauv blanc was only $6 a glass and it was a steal considering some of the other restaurants in Singapore.There was a waitress who could not fully understand English, perhaps my accent was a little thick (she sounded Korean) but our request was quickly rectified.We had a lovely time and as were many other tables, drinking and dining making the whole space very lovely and fun.Definitely a good spot to break the ice for a business discussion
5
Walked by this afternoon to make reservations. Very delicious food and good cocktails. Had salmon. It was exceptional, moist and fresh . unique flavor.
Coffee was excellent. Very good service and price is not high. Good dinner and satisfies.
4
The mocktails are interesting and the discount card for such drinks is helpful. The food is good but it is not the defining attraction of the restaurant.
1
Dropped in for a casual brunch meal and didnt get served until 45 mins later. Service was unfriendly and forgot our order.
4
Came with my wife. No special occasion, just looking for good food. Grilled salmon and prawn pasta were excellent. Sangria is something you must have if you come. Not suitable to dine on a budget but great value.
5
I was there with my friends, it was a last minute decision because I was craving for a nice steak. It was raining heavily so we decided to settle for Platypus. The staff there is attentive and friendly.. but I like the food most.. the steak that I had was just at my liking Medium rare. And the Chef did a good job! Generous serving with affordable price. What else can you ask for?
5
Visited this restaurant as it was a walk away from our hotel. And it was without a doubt one of the best meals of the trip so far! The cuisine was local inspired modern fare which was exciting to me.We had the ribeye steak which was incredible and the Asian inspired sauce of truffles and honey was so delicious. I am going to re create it when I get back home! We also ordered a salmon rice bowl, which was poached to perfection and extremely tender. We also loved the truffle fries. Big portions with real truffle shavings!Overall, we had a superb experience here. Amazing food with very warm service and the place was very playing trendy tunes at night too. Good vibes
5
Restaurant trends come and go but Platypus Kitchen has remained a staple for my group of friends for the past few years. Nowhere in Singapore wins Platypus ... the chill, upbeat, unpretentious vibe with cool decor always strikes home all the time, whatever the occasion... the food is reasonably priced, with a variety of choice and robust flavour. Keep it up Platypus!!!

My friend and I decided to visit this place after the other place we planned to go was closed. I remember there was a good restaurant in this area that I went to with a friend long time ago; however, I couldn't remember what it was. So we went to Platypus Kitchen by accident. The food was good (and I only reviewed the ones we ordered). Shaved Truffle Fries was great (we could taste the truffle), Ribeye & Truffle bowl was great (I could taste the truffle and portion was big enough). My friend ordered 3-course weekday dinner - great Roasted Pumpkin Soup, delicious Grilled Chicken, and supposedly a Vanilla Ice Cream. Yes, supposedly, because it didn't come. Partially it was our mistake by not remembering it since we were too drawn into an amazing conversation and enjoyed the company so much; however, this was the first restaurant that the staff didn't remind us (or offered us) if we would like the dessert to be served. It seemed that they only concern about the restaurant operational time so they can leave on time. First, they asked if we had last order; second, they immediately produced the bill for us to pay (based on the bill it was 21:22:37 on Feb. 6), although the restaurant opening hours was until 22:30 (I assume their last order was 21:30). It felt like we were being rushed to finish our visit and leave the premises. That's bad service and it was not acceptable in the service industry. If it was based on service (that we experienced that night), I would give the rating 1 out of 5, but since the food was nice, I gave this restaurant an average rating
4
Since we were staying around the corner and we were tired of the hotel food, we thought we would give this place a try. It was ok. I had the set menu with the chili crab bun which was very good and then the shrimp bowl which was good. The panna cotta dessert was fair. No taste of vanilla there. Service was very good and the wifi fast. Might come back
4
we went here twice to try sandwich, pasta, and chicken.Service was great and staff were very kind. Sandwich was good. Pasta was also good, but I perdonally prefer more al dente. The chicken tasted great, but was undercooked such that inner part was still bleeding. Staff told me that it was Chinese traditional style to undercook it and asked if we wanted to have it throughly cooked. We said yes and they kindly cooked it again. For those not familiar with the undercooked chicken, ask them to throughly cook them. Overall, the food is good and certainly worth the money. I would visit here again
4
Had the 2 people sharing menu and it was more than enough food for 3 people. All the food we had was great. Good cocktail with HH available. Prices are extremely affordable. Will come back again!
1
Waited for 30 mins for my spring chicken and got a food which is not well cooked. There's still blood in the flesh of the chicken.
Worst lunch experience in this restaurant.
5
Food was great, conveniently located too.
Service was prompt, waiters were attentive and friendly as well.
3
Had pasta at this place for lunch. Not too bad but nothing special either. They have a lunch special: 14.9++ for some pastas including a drink and soup or salad. For this price ok deal but wouldn't wanna pay full price.
5
Service: Prompt, the servers knows their menu and recommendations well. Reservations allowed. Ambience: Cosy, adequately dim lit (Bugis branch, indoor seats). Food: Didn't wait long. Apart from not so fresh truffle fries, the appetizers & mains rocks, every.single.dish. Desserts/beers were alright. A place many friends & I agreed to be back again for sure.
4
We had a gathering of friends here recently for a weekday dinner. With no one willing to overspend unnecessarily, the set meals on offer seemed like a rather good idea. We had made reservations but it didn't seem needed as the restaurant wasn't crowded when we arrived. Nevertheless, a good-sized area meant that large groups would probably be fairly easily accommodated. The set menu had three appetisers, eight mains, and three desserts. So while it was relatively easy to mix and match courses, I did find myself having to switch appetisers to prevent duplicating the theme of my main dish. In the end, I chose the lobster bisque (strong seafood taste without being overly salty), the chilli crab linguine (spicy and piquant but a little too sweet for pasta), and the wild berry pannacotta (very nice). Unexpectedly, the highlight for me was the cocktail I had. There are around ten different selections but only three were being offered at a special rate. I went with the Napa citrus sangria that evening - a very refreshing find. While I couldn't help feeling that picking the set menu didn't allow me (and our group) from discovering the best the restaurant had to offer, I think we had experienced enough to warrant another visit in the future
4
Set dinner pricing at $26 is very reasonable. Serving size is quite big. The food is good & full of ingredient. The truffle pasta I ordered was ok but a bit too creamy to my liking. Soup is good. Dessert is amazing. Tried the matcha lava with ice cream & as stated on the menu - lava is more than cake.The description on the menu is the most detailed I have seen. Chocolate lava was described as 66% dark chocolate, lava more than cake!Also like the small cards on the table called - Table topic. Good for when you are running out of topic. One of the card I picked up said - what would you eat if you were to put on 10 pounds
5
I was here with my son for lunch today. Cafe has good ambience,staff was attentive and friendly. I had pastas and fries and it was GOOD. The food are reasonably priced and good portion of food as well. I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends
4
My friends and I were wandering around Bugis area trying to find a restaurant for a birthday celebration after 9.30pm on a Friday. Most of the places we inquired told us that their kitchen was closing soon. However at Platypus, not only were we welcomed with signage of $6 beer but the waiters and waitresses greeted us with enthusiasm even though our party of 4 might mean a late closure for them. We were given a mini coaster informing us that first drink will be at $6 and we zoomed straight onto the alcoholic drinks menu. Decided to have lychee soju martini since its singles day and a Sangria for our birthday friend.Dinner was served fast and hot off the stove! We weren't expecting our dinner to be piping hot especially not when we were the last batch of customers to walk into the restaurant. All of us went for the 3 course dinner set and everything was so delicious! So happy to find a new hangout at Bugis
5
Have my birthday dinner over there with my boyfriend on Saturday. We've ordered the set course menu for 2 pax, comes with 3 appetizers, 2 main course and a dessert. The portion is quite generous and big for both of us. The food at there is superb and worth its value! Will definitely visit there again if I travel to Singapore.
5
Food arrived very quickly upon ordering. Timing of main course came right after we finished our starter. Main course was delicious. Serving was big. Service was good.
3
Cold beers, decent tasty food and reasonable prices. Supposedly this place is a play on Aussie pub style but not really sure about that one. Stop there to get out of the night heat and humidity which was worthwhile. I'd give it a try again.
3
First night in Singapore, we were looking for somewhere to have a bite after settling in. Walked past this 2 times before deciding to enter. All the staff were friendly and we recieved the half price cocktail promo. We tried 2 each off the menu and both were pretty good. Not outstanding tho. The price was a little hefty for the better type ones. Ordered the bbq pork bowl, good size portion and the food came out quickly. But the pork was very dry and tasteless. The rest of the dish was ok. But some sauce and a juicy pork, this would have been a win.
2
My family & I went back in September.At that point the Restaurants Reviews were mainly pretty good, with just one recent one that said they had no idea why the place had such high ratings.As I write this now I see that more people have written bad reviews, so looks like a change for the worse has happened.Nothing about my visit was good.Service was very poor, even though there were plenty of staff, they just couldn't be bothered.Food was for me awful, my children had steaks that I'm not kidding, tasted synthetic, I've never tasted anything like it, and not in a good way!!Price was average for Singapore, but given the poor everything, I was less than impressed.It looks as if its a nice place, and no doubt has the potential, but I'd suggest, do yourself a favour, go elsewhere
3
I ordered the hoisin roasted pork and water cress sandwich with a side of mesclun and fries. I wanted to give the food 4 stars, because they didn't hold back any punches in the sandwich- it had sweetness and spice (fresh cut chillis!) and there was crunch in the watercress and cucumber thins. Add to that some cherry tomatoes and it was quite a treat. But I decided to take away half a star because there was too much fat in the meat and the fries were over-fried (and therefore hard). Mesclun was light and decent though. They need to pay a little more attention to their food
3
Visited Platypus Kitchen on Saturday night; despite the food being tasty, the service was quite poor.It wasn't particularly busy when we came in around 8:30/9:00 and from my experience they were more than adequately staffed. Unfortunately we felt pretty forgotten about, as did the table next to us who ended up walking out having waited and waited for their order to be taken, not that their departure was quickly noticed! We had actually planned to stay for dessert but just got fed up of waiting for someone to take our order, so when someone finally came over we ended up asking for the bill instead.It didn't seem that staff take responsibility for any particular section of the restaurant so maybe it was presumed by all that us and the other table had been seen to when in fact we hadn't. Luckily, what did come out of the kitchen was nice, so a 3/5 seems fair
1
It was a family nite out at Bugis Junction .... and to be honest we decided on Platypus for the simple reason to try some place totally new frpom our usual haunts. Moreover it was my wife's birthday. Our orders were the lobster bisque ( served warm ... and thick ), chicken wings, salad, salmon rice bowl, and I ordered the ribeye ( medium rare ). The service was good but ..... the quality of food & presentation in our opinion way below par ..... at $29 for a ribeye ( very fatty .... I'd been concerned if they'd charged by weight ) I could've gotten a better grilled steak in some hawker centres that I know of.It was not a good experience for me & my family, and I will not return under any circumstance.I will not recommend to any of my family or friends
1
Just to preface this review, I'm not a professional food taster but I do cook and dabble in the kitchen. I'm no expert but I have eaten at all sorts of establishments and I cook across different cuisines. I must say that I feel somewhat deceived because Platypus kitchen was ranked 90th of 8000 plus dining establishments in Singapore by tripadvisor and the dining experience was bad.Review follows:Came here for a date night.Date ordered the Onsen Egg Carbonara, I ordered the highly rated Truffle Beef Rice bowl. To share we had pumpkin soup and chili crab buns.Starters:Soup - savoury and tasty. Bacon bits were a nice touch. Burnt bits helped to lift the flavour of the soup but at the end of the day nothing spectacular. It is pumpkin soup, it isn't very hard to whip up. Chili crab buns - interesting flavour and textures but I found it on the sweet side and the potential complexities were lost because of that. Rather disappointing as this was supposed to be one of Platypus Kitchen's stand out dishes. Mains:Truffle beef rice - absolute disappointment. Shockingly bad. Of 8 of 10 beef morsels that came with the dish were gristle or overly fatty. Each beef morsel what I consumed made me angrier and angrier. It is because I was on what was a lovely date that I didn't want to make an issue of it and that I resolved to write an honest review on tripadvisor as it was tripadvisor that brought me to Platypus kitchen. Truffle flavour wasn't quite right and tasted like it came out of a chemistry kit than from a proper bottle of truffle and truffle oil. Onsen Egg Carbonara - the only redeeming grace of this dish was that the pasta was al dente. The sauce was watery and weak, it was more like insipid cheese water than a proper carbonara. The taste of the sauce was at best underwhelming and if I was a more discerning customer I would say Campbell's soup out of the can would have done a better job.Service: excellent, courteous and attentive. It helped that we had our meal before the dinner crowd. Ease of booking: good, easy to call and make reservation. No problem when we arrived 1/2 hr early
5
The chicken and craft beers here are excellent. I would recommend the spicy flavours as it had a nice hint of sweetness. Oh also do try their hot wings, its a little like koren fried chicken.Service was fast and they provided a water pitcher to our table which was greatly appreciated.
5
Absolutely love the carbonara which came with the most perfect onsen egg ever! Every mouthful was a delight I wipe up the bowl in matter of secs. We ordered the sweet potato fries which were great too. A wonderful place for friends and family to get together over a hearty & awesome meal
5
budget friendly not too expensive, menu is informative and easy to understand, food is superb! portioning is big as well 👍🏼 3rd time already but still coming back for more!
5
As always, Platypus uses the best ingredients, and brings out their flavors to the fullest! The truffle pasta was simply orgasmic. I'm feeling hungry just thinking about it!
5
Greatly pleasing to the taste especially the Chilli Crab Linguini & mushroom soup.The restaurant has a pleasant & soothing ambience .Thumbs UP!
4
Food is good and familiar. Cocktails are really cool and a great deal! The shop is conveniently located.
3
I found this restaurant through TA, and chose to check it out because of the superb rating. I echo 100% the review by the previous reviewer - super busy & very popular, but not sure why". The service was prompt enough, but quality of food was just very average (the chili crab was definitely not one of the best I had in Singapore). My son ordered pasta and even though it was just such a simple dish, he didn't enjoy it much too. The only saving grace was the Moten Lava Choc Brownie (something like that..). THAT was simply delicious. I saw a lot of office crowd and young couple in this restaurant. I feel that it is more of a place for social gatherings than great food
3
They have lovely menu... the staff are just too busy as the restaurant is really busy all the time... we liked the menu selection but the food did not impress us so much... sorry but I think there are many nicer restaurants close to this area that you can choose
4
Platypus Kitchen is conveniently located at Bugis Junction but faces onto Victoria Street so the restaurant has a great feel and ambience to it.First cocktails are $6 and there was an interesting range and they were delicious. We chose the three-course set menu from $26.90. There are some great options to choose from, although many of them you pay a little extra for so the meal can end up being closer to $40 each.The meals came out quickly, except they forgot our dessert so after waiting quite awhile (15 mins) we had to remind staff we were still waiting. Despite this, the food was excellent with good portions. You definitely won't leave hungry.We can recommend the pumpkin soup as the starter - one of the best we've tasted and the steak, truffle and rice was also delicious and the steak was perfectly cooked.If you're after a nice big meal, great drinks and atmosphere, check out Platypus Kitchen

I have had numerous meals at this restaurant and have always been impressed with the prompt, friendly service and the quality of the food. I've have tried most of their mains offered for set lunch and was never disappointed. The tables are set far apart making eavesdropping harder. This is also one of the few places that I've no qualms returning from even if they increase their prices by 20%. So it is a great value and much appreciated in the bugis Are.

Visited Platypus Kitchen for lunch on 4th August and i must say the service was very prompt. I had a 3 course executive lunch plus drink at about $25. The mushroom soup, Crab Pasta, Panna Cotta all tasted really good!!Overall it was definitely value for money. The last i dine there, was when it is still located at some corner in bugis junction. It is now easily located along the main road facing Bugis Plus. I look forward to going back there again for dinner soon

We had the set meal (3 courses) hits the value spot 1) appetisers Chili crab bread A spunky rendition not wow but not bad either Lobster bisque This was delicious with a lobster flavour covered thru the soup. 2) mains Ribeye rice bowlOh my god ! It was melt in your melt beef with runny onsen eggs ! And hints of truffles fluttering your taste buds ohh so yummmmmmm Roasted chicken with sesame? Chicken was roasted perfectly. Not dry around the breast areas . Just nice . But after the ribeye bowl, nothing was just as nice ! 3) desserts Ice cream & panna cotta Both was alright . Nothing to rave about Will def come back to try others . Or maybe I will just stick to the beef rice bowl goodness :)
3
They really have a good food and beverage menu, a wide selection of drinks as well. We ate at Bugis branch. It's small but the place is veeery cozy with a very nice bar.
5
First time visit this restaurant. It has nice ambience and nice food. Will definitely visit again next time!
5
Great ambiance with really awesome food. Love the Crustacean rice bowl and pumpkin soup
Friendly staffs, albeit some staff seems new and slow in communicating our requests
5
It's got a great selection of monitors and beer mixes. The food was great especially liked the lobster bisque.
4
Just had lunch with a friend, I ordered from the brunch menu the gravelax salmon with a side of garlic bread, both were delicious! My friend got half a chicken which he loved (although he was a bit disappointed by the fries). Overall a really nice meal, maybe a bit overpriced
5
We ordered the chopped house steak, pumpkin soups and a salad to share among three of us. The steak was huge and at $80 plus was enough for sharing. It was done just right, pink and juicy! The soups were one of the best we have had taken! Great value for such a wonderful meals
5
Ribeye beef bowl a must try. It's definitely on the pricey side. But if you're looking for soft mouthwatering beef and runny onsen eggs, look no further. On the other hand, their garlic prawn linguine was a total let down. So maybe you want to avoid that. Their salmon Bowl was alright. But ribeye beef bowl is still my fav!
5
We had the grilled chicken and the marbled beef rice bowl and they were second to none! The chicken was aromatic and really well seared. My favourite was the rice bowl which was a delicious mix of beef, truffles and a decadent runny egg. All of which made for a really delicious meal.Good food paired with excellent craft beers. A lovely time and a great place for dinner
3
We had a salad, garlic bread, pasta with chilli crab and pasta with mushrooms. The salad was just average - a few salad leaves and a few cherry tomatoes. The pasta smelled good and tasted ok as well. However, the chilli crab pasta had no chilli, the mushroom pasta was meant to be a burnt butter sauce - it was just cream. It was all edible but not what was expected. Some fresh pepper would've been good but none was offered). The service is ok. It's not a place to linger and it wouldn't be a place to go out of your way for. Not bad but not great.
5
Great little restaurant just out of town. We had the sweet potato poutine, Lime and Thyme chicken and the BBQ pork bowl, as well as a drink, all for $70. All were lovely, portion sizes were satisfying and the $6 for your first drink special is a great idea.
5
The food was fantastic. There is wide selection from pasta to beef and chicken. My family enjoyed the food. Good quality food served. Service was excellent !!!
3
I had high expectations because of all of the high reviews and left feeling it was only average. I had the steak and it came out cooked wrong. My friend said that the wings were good. The service was just average as well.
4
The waiters were attentive, some of the menu choices were quite unique and the overall restaurant vibes was chill
4
Recommended for those who loves lobster.
This place offers lobster at reasonable cost and the portion is decent. The staffs are helpful and quick which is always a good point. A trendy and busy place...be prepared to queue during peak hours.
4
Had brunch here.
Food and ambience is good.
Just don't really like the Korean soju lychee .
Appreciate that a slice of small chocolate was prepared to surprise my partner. Cake is on the house.
It's lovely!!
4
Ordered a whole chicken to share and the sauce we chose was Rosemary. It was really good and service was on point as well. Would def head back!
5
Visited on a recommendation by our hotel and we had a great time at this restaurant. We loved the cocktails and craft beers here, at at $6 each it was incredible value for Singapore.The food was excellent as well, a careful mix of Asian, European and American flavours. We shared a grilled chicken, which to date, is still the most succulent I have ever had. We also had the chophouse steak and some Japanese beef bowls, they were spectacular, especially the rice bowl which paired the wagyu seemlessly with truffles.This turned out to be one of our favorite meals in Singapore; not only was it gastronomical and delicious, it was affordable considering other restaurants of this level in Singapore. Thanks to Vi from Intercontinental for the recommendation, Highly recommended and two thumbs up
5
Platypus is my go to restaurant for a great meal everytime. I have probably been here about 12 times and each time they manage to make it extra special! I am a big fan of their rice bowls and I would highly recommend them; in particular, the Wagyu beef and truffle and the poached salmon with ikura. Extremely delicious and comes with that 'wow' factor.Wine and beers are very reasonable and they usually have a promotion which allows one drink for $6. That's almost unheard of in Singapore. Good job mr platypus.Service is top notch and the music is always good.
5
Came with my family and they loved it! The grilled chicken was amazingly tender and the flavours were just right! We also enjoyed the steak and some rice bowls they were fantastic as well.Service was efficient, and they gave us a jug of ice cold water for our table. We were surprised that they didn't charge for water, as so many restaurants in Singapore do!The restaurant is a little sparse, they could do a little more to decorate their walls, however, the bar looks very nice and the place can be described as having cool vibes.We also had two cocktails. I would recommend the lychee martini, over the more pricy cocktails, where are not on promotional.I highly recommend this restaurant. from the bottom of my heart
4
A nice place to hangout with friends. Good service, nice foods, nice cocktail and serves one of the best truffle fries in town
4
We had dinner at platypus restaurant. Food was good and service is very fast. Cast Iron grill rosemary chicken was very juicy and soft. kids love the choc lava cake.
4
The service staff was very polite & attentive. The food was interesting, yet value for money. I will definitely be back!
3
Brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Platypus serves pseudo Japanese , Italian cuisine. Fusion I Guess. Food was so-so and service was not very commendable. Nice ambience though.
1
I had low expectations to begin with but somehow they managed to let me down beyond what i expected! Food was bad, period! I do not recommend the place!
5
It is interesting to come back for second visit.Had Iron Cast half Chicken this time,Lime and Thyme flavour.Chicken is juicy and Tender.The cut for their fries is well chosen.Moscato is fruity and sweetService is brisk and efficient,with no card mix up or bill mix up as what I described in my last review (means service improved!
4
It has been a while since my visit to Platypus Kitchen, though, what I can still remember from this place is that it is was a fun experience.The seafood pasta was tasty and full of crustacean flavor, the only thing is that they use fresh pasta so it can't be al dente, which obviously depends on each personal preference. Their Roast Chicken is so aromatic and juicy that when you cut into it it splashes. it also came with a side of good fries. Cocktails on offer was a good bargain at $6 for our first glass. The Pink martini was a tad too sweet for our liking, while, the Chocolate Rum was quite delicious. Nothing special about the dessert, in fact the lava cake was the least of my favorit
5
We had a late lunch at Platypus Kitchen. We shared a Platypus lobster roll and chocolate lava cake. Both were delicious. My wife had a glass of moscato that was very sweet. We like the layout of the restaurant that provides more than usual privacy for the tables. The server was very friendly and attentive. We appreciate that Platypus does not close in the afternoons, and it is in a central location. This an an excellent restaurant
5
This was my third visit to Platypus and the food was superb as usual. We ordered a sharing steak and the chicken for lunch and they were both delicious!In particular, the chicken was extremely moist and well marinated. The sauce which came with the steak, a sweet truffley sauce, went really well with both dishes. They should definitely add on a version of the chicken with truffles, I think that would be divine!Service was brisk and efficient, really appreciated the large carafe of water which was given to my table for easy refills
5
We decided on Platypus for dinner because we missed the truffle & ribeye bowl and their truffle fries. Their 3-course set menu is very affordable, and portions are the same as the ala carte menu. They have a variety of cocktails too, with other interesting sweet drinks. We loved this place and will be back again. :)
5
Lovely,friendly place,always buzzing of an evening and was very convenient as it was across the road from our hotel.We only had a sharing platter but it was very good and went down well with the 6$ cocktails!
5
Really loving this place!
Have been dropping by with various groups over the past few months since the discovery of this place.
Will be back again soon for the Truffle beef rice bowl yum yum!
5
Great food service drinks all at reasonable price you will not be disappointed must try. They do three course meal for $26 plus first drink cocktail only $6. Good wine too!!
4
The food was pretty decent... go for the truffle beef bowl, along with the lobster bisque soup as a 3 course meal for only $26++... wouldn't mind trying it again soon.
5
Been there a few times, still in love with their truffles fries.
Esp their Ribeye Truffle Rice Bowl! the beef is so tender and the smell of truffles is beyond describe.
Do go for their 3 course dinner. it's worth the price.
5
The roast chicken is deeeeelicious! cocktails are amazing. And the service is great. Perfect location! Great price!
5
Had gone for dinner on a Sunday evening and had a very nice time. Ordered the 3 course set meal and a portion of the hot wings. The set meal had a starter of steamed bun with chilly crab, main of rib eye beef with truffles and a desert of wild berry panna cotta. The food was quite nice, good flavors, decent portion sizes. The set meal was good, but what will really make me visit again were the hot wings, they were crisp, spicy, sweet and succulent. I have only been there once, but if that is how the chef always makes the hot wings this restaurant will have some of the best wings I've ever had
3
Food was only average, nothing to shout about. We had a set dinner, so I had the Chilli crab baos which were only okay. My Boyfriend had the lobster bisque which didn't really taste like lobster bisque. I had carbonara for main which was also only average. And my Boyfriend had the beef bowl which was probably the best thing among what we ate. Then we had Apple tart and pana cotta to end the meal and the pana cotta was abit watery. It needed more gelatin to be abit more firm
2
I was expecting more because of all of the reviews, but the place fell short. I cannot complain since it was one of a few places still open after 10. HOWEVER, they close at 11:30, but they actually stop taking food orders at 10:15pm. At least that is what I was told. I also felt rushed to sign the check when I finished my meal at 10:45. Otherwise the place had a good vibe and decent music.Food however was not great. I actually had the $26 lobster roll which came in a hot dog bun. Not sure who's idea that was - this dish definitely not worth the money. The drinks were good and they offer a $6 first drink menu - had the Secret Soju Agent which was tasty and a deal. Overall not the experience I was expecting. Maybe it was an off night and the staff was itching to get out, but you have to live up to your rep.
4
I've been to Platypus 5 or 6 times, either with friends, family, or on dates. As a wallet-friendly yet date-worthy option in the heart of the city, you really can't beat this place. Set lunches and dinners are reasonably priced, and portions are generous. The chef is also flexible enough to accommodate dietary restrictions (I'm lactose-intolerant). The crab-ikura bucatini, chicken pesto pasta and truffle carbonara are fabulous, as are the rice bowls (soju pork and angus beef). If you're having the set, I'd recommend the pumpkin soup over the salad/buns. The famous truffle fries are the best I have ever tasted. Also, don't leave without trying the cocktails - $6 for a soju cocktail is pretty hard to beat! Part of the reason why I'm not giving this 5 stars is the noise level. I had to ask the staff to turn down the volume of the music 3 times on my 2nd visit, or I couldn't carry on a proper conversation. The restaurant also gets pretty darn crowded on weekends, and it's hard to get attention sometimes. Most of the service staff are lovely, but there are a few who never seem to smile. That said, I'd pick Platypus over almost any restaurant in the area for date night =
4
I patronise Platypus whenever i am at bugis for my business lunch. The environment is conducive, the waitress are polite and stand by ready to assist without being too intrusive. I like the weekday ladies lunch best. It comes with soup, main and drink. All these for abt $10 plus up to $15 if you want meat itemHighly recommend.
4
Food is fantastic. Helpful staff. Ambience is great. Would feel the food is a little pricey. Good to try out if you have a little budget:)
4
They have good food and fast service. The pumpkin soup is really delish. They have value for money set lunches on weekdays as well, it's been one of my favourites for the past few months.
4
We had the 3 course dinner special and it was all delicious and portions were generous. Don't miss the $6 cocktail special either. Service was very fast even though the restaurant was full
4
On the overall, I had a great dining experience. It was a nice and satisfying weekend dinner by myself.
4
Two of us went for dinner. We had one set dinner and one ala carte meal. We upgraded the set meal. The lobster & crustacean bisque was good; tasty and yet not too rich. Ribeye & truffle rice bowl was a disappointment. The beef was tough and the rice bowl was lukewarm at best. The wild berry pannacotta dessert was good.For ala carte, we tried the sundried chicken pesto. I have to say this was the standout of the meal. Super delicious and not too creamy.We had the house wine - Savignon blanc. It was fruity and pleasant although not very complex in taste.Overall it was a good experience apart from the ribeye & truffle rice bowl
5
I stumbled upon this place whilst looking for place with a quiet ambience to unwind and have lunch. I was very pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food served at the Platypus Kitchen and despite not being a fan of pumpkin soup,this place has one of the best pumpkin soups i've had thus far. I would also highly recommend that one tries the Salmon & Ikura bowl, as it's a feast for one's eyes and stomach. Thumbs up to the chefs and friendly wait staff @ Platypus! I will certainly be back to sample the rest of the fare with more friends :)
4
Platypus is the first restaurant that follows up with an email to thank us after we completed their feedback form.We had the Italian chicken and mushroom pasta. Both were quite good, especially the chicken which was tender and juicy. However, we thought both dishes might have been better if they were less salty.Overall, the place feels good for us family with young children as your service staff was attentive in providing colouring materials to keep the kids entertained and children's cutlery for the kids without prompting
4
Food is delicious yet a bit pricey, truffle fries was not as expected delicious. cocktail is 6 dollars for the first glass which is really cheap! However, the cocktail called Holidays in Singapore was bitter.. My friend said that was a hard truth for holiday in Singapore, I can't help rolling my eyes to him. We ordered 2 main courses, 1 cocktail and 1 glass of red wine and one truffle fries, and total bill is 98 something, but happily they give us a 20 dollars off voucher when we spend over 100 (but I don't know when we will use it,haha). The wait staff is very attentive. Music is a bit loud which is not suitable for chatting, at least that's not for us. We have been looking for quiet restaurant but fail to do so. Oh, did I forget to say that the food they serve was exactly what you saw on their facebook page? That's really awesome as I like to choose the food according to pictures, lol. Kitchen is half open and you can see the chef cooking. There were also table topics placed in the cutlery basket which was considerate for people who don't know how to start a topic. Overall the dinning experience in platypus is not bad. We had a good memory
5
Here for lunch. Convenient location, above Bugis train station. Waiter is friendly and can speak a little Japanese. Helpful to recommend food and drinks. The beef bowl is very good with nice beef quality and good size. Chicken is very tender and good juicy. Will come again. Gambate!
5
Walking into the restaurant, the ambience was great, it wasn't too noisy so my companion and I could save ourselves from screaming over the noise, and it wasn't too quiet such that people around us could hear our conversations. The place was cosy and comfortable. What takes the cake was the "Good Lobang" promotion where we paid $6 each for our first drink. Apparently it's an all day, everyday promotion! More places should have this promotion. My friend had the ChocolateX and it was really yummy. The bartender didn't cut back on the alcohol at all and we loved the rich chocolate-y taste that came along with it. I had the house wine, which was full-bodied and delicious as well. For dinner I had the Bacon & Sweet Potato Poutine, which is hand-cut sweet potato fries with parmesan, sour cream and bacon. The fries were crisp and not too oily, and the toppings went really well with the fries without drowning out the taste of the sweet potato. I enjoyed it very much. My friend had the Sous-Vide Ribeye Steak which he said was tender and juicy.Overall it was a great experience and we left the restaurant feeling contented. The meal was very affordable too
5
Great dining experience with friendly staff! $6 cocktail for your first drink is a steal! Food is of a reasonable portion and the taste is sublime!
5
staff called a few hours before our reservation time to confirm our attendance. ambiance is good, perfect for couple date! food was served fast and the staffs there gave very pleasant service (e.g. water was filled immediately once it's 1/4 full). will definitely visit platypus@bugis again
4
My wife had been here with her friends a while back and she wanted me to have a wonderful experience with her. And so we did! Both of us got the weekday 3-course set dinner with Ribeye and Truffle Rice Bowl and it was delicious. The beef is soft, juicy and the taste of the truffle lingers in your mouth long after the bowl has been cleaned out. Service attendants were attentive and prompt, except on our dessert which required us to remind. However above all else, it was definitely an experience we would like to revisit again.
5
Visited this casual restaurant during cocktail week and had an amazing time, we enjoyed it so much that we ended up coming back for a second visit the day after; both the food and drinks were exquisite!The cocktails were deliciously strong and well designed with wonderful complex flavors. We were lucky that each drink was only $6 during this period. We order pretty much everything on the menu. We were told that their signature cocktail was the ChocolateX and that was so rich and decadent! The food was no slouch and the rice bowls were our favourites, we had the Ribeye and truffle bowl and a salmon bowl; the flavour of sous-vide salmon was wonderful and was well complimented with the fresh fish eggs that were ontop. The ribeye beef was melt-in-your-mouth good.We also had a huge steak, called the Chophouse, it was served with a truffle sauce and was perfectly done to our liking, medium rare. Highly recommended if you have the stomach for a 700gram piece of meat.Service was brisk and our food came in record time. Bravo!Oh and they have the cutest espresso cups! :) :) :

In Summary:Outstanding drinks, food that tends more towards fine dining and all these at a good price. Why hesitate to try?*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:My partner and I used to visit the Platypus at the Arcade in Raffles and the V8 café which later got taken over by Platypus in Bugis. To our disappointment, we could no longer find the Platypus on level 2 where it used to be and we thought that it closed down forever. A casual search online proved us wrong and we were informed of its new location. A casual drop-by on Valentine’s Day wasn’t meant to be as they were fully booked. By then, we have realized how different the restaurant looks and we wondered if this was the homely Platypus where we used to dine at. We visited yet again in the last week of February and then again at the start of March for dinner and lunch respectively, as we couldn’t believe how much the restaurant has transformed for the better. We will be there again soon.1. Service – 3.5 out of 5Nothing extraordinary here, but nothing of concern too. Just the typical Singaporean restaurant’s level of service. A point for consideration if Platypus intends to be one of the finest. P.S. If you have provided your email in the survey form, they will continuously seek your feedback for improvements. Good effort on their part.2. Ambiance – 4.5 out of 5Restaurant interior is well-decorated and hints of good taste. Seats are well positioned and none of the tables feel too near. Restaurant is well-lit as half of it is enclosed by glass walls. Apparently the restaurant is more well-known by tourists than the locals, as noticed during both our visits there and observing the crowd. Tripadvisor must have done much for the advertising of the restaurant!3. Cleanliness – 4 out of 5Nothing of concern but the nicely printed menu for drinks is deteriorating at a scary rate. Not good for first impressions but that’s me nitpicking on a fine restaurant.4. Taste – 5 out of 5The collaboration with Dingo is a great move. For a restaurant gunning to be the place for fun and social gatherings, you cannot go wrong with fantastic drinks. To add – the first drink is $6, no matter the time but limited to the four cocktails that comes with the deal. Yet another good move as I was tempted to pay the full price for my next cocktail just to see what wonderful concoction (I believe that are more than 10 to choose from) the bartenders have in store. Maybe next time after better results from my health checkup. The set dinner and brunch prove to be one of the better deals in the Bugis region where there are restaurants almost everywhere. Feeling nostalgic? The classic pastas are available, complemented by surprisingly good starters and desserts.Presentation of food is top-notch and effort is put into the slightest details. Flavours are well-balanced, almost too perfectly, like a mathematical equation. It is quite unbelievable that all this comes at an affordable price.5. Value for Money – 5 out of 5Go for the set meals, they provide great value

Visited the Platypus Kitchen in Bugis. A warm intimate ambience which provides a cozy dining experience. Mediterranean inspired dishes are carefully plated which comes as a surprise from an affordable eatery. Nic, the restaurant owner, took time to explain how every single ingredient is specially sourced and curated to ensure a good blend of unique flavors that complement each other. They also take pride in using organic produce which has obvious health benefits. Always good to know that the food you’re eating is free of preservatives and at the same time, kinder to the environment!Overall, a truly enjoyable experience and will return for sure! Would like to thank the staff there for their hospitable service
4
The food was pretty good, service was great too. Would recommend for people who are looking for a fairly cheap and quality meal.
5
Came across this place and their steak with truffle sauce is a must try. The cast iron roasted chicken is really good as well. Service is fast. The overall ambiance of the place is very relaxing. I would strongly recommend this place. Will definitely return again
5
Platypus Kitchen was an enjoyable dining experience for me. If you are a truffle fan like me, I must recommend you to try the steak with their truffle sauce and truffle fries. The steak doneness came out exactly the way I ordered it, which was very important to me as I wss pregnant when I patronised the restaurant. They are very generous in their use of truffle. I finished off with a molten lava cake for dessert and that made the perfect meal for me! Not only was the food good, the service staff were polite and very attentive. Would definitely want to go back again
5
Came across the restaurant randomly and decided to give it a try. Started dinner not expecting much but left a really satisfied diner. Food was amazing, service was prompt and atmosphere was great. A place to consider for regular dinner and lunch options
5
I would like to give a big shoutout for Platypus. It is a frequent hang out place for me and of course my friends and family. Their staffs are attentive and responsive enough to serve you right, especially I need special care due to the reason I'm allergic to various allergens. Hence, my every single visit the Chef, Adrian or the boss, Nicholas will definitely ensure the food are safe for me. My favourite food at Platypus is the dedicated Grilled chicken(drooling). It never disappoint me. I am looking forward to the more exciting new dishes by end of this month!

After a long flight from New York to Singapore through Doha, we were exhausted and wanted a place to have a late lunch near our hotel, Intercontinental Singapore. We walked about the mall and this was the only restaurant which looked packed and popular. So we went in and got a table for the two of us.The restaurant had a hip atmosphere and played great music. As we were seated, we were given some drink coupons which offered our first drink at a discounted price! We ordered 2 cocktails and a moscato to share. The cocktails were wonderful, Asian flavors mixed in a classic style; I highly recommend the Joy juice which has Korean liquor and strawberry.For our lunch we had the grilled chicken and Squid-ink pasta; the chicken was tender and flavorful throughout the entire bird. It’s one of the best I have ever tried. The squidink lobster pasta was a little pricy, but it was packed full of wonderful garlic and black ink flavors!For our first meal in Singapore, we were highly impressed and we loved every moment dining in this cool restaurant. We actually made a reservation for dinner on Friday before we leave for Bali the next day
5
Went there for business. Place was fairly busy but we were served fairly quickly. Water was top up without us asking for it. There are 5 of us. One guy was looking for light lunch and the lady set was suitable. Staff said no problem since you guys have a lady in the group. The portion was fair and enough for us. We managed to be back to the office before our lunch time was ove
5
Food was excellent and service was prompt and fast. All these for a really affordable price. Me and my friends had a great time at the restaurant
5
The food at Platypus never failed to amaze me and my friends. It tastes different and it delights us with the new experience
5
Headed to Platypus with a few pals for dinner, and we were given the large communal table beside the window which was close to the kitchen yet private enough for us to have a lot of conversation and catching up.Once we were seated, the service was very prompt and the servers were always there when we needed something.When the food came, it looked and smelled amazing, and tasted even better. Particularly the truffle carbonara, chicken wings for me. And all that good food at a reasonable price point.I highly recommend this place and will definitely go back again!

My boyfriend and I visited the Bugis Junction outlet on a Sunday evening. We made a reservation beforehand, but the restaurant wasn't very crowded anyway, much to our delight.We ordered the Weekend 3-course Dinner set ($26.90++) and found it very worthwhile. For starters, we had the Roasted Pumpkin Soup which really started us off well - thick and flavourful but not too overwhelming that one would feel sick after a few mouthfuls; and also the Chilli Crab Asian buns - it was refreshing to eat those fluffy buns with chilli crab instead of with the usual pork belly.For main course, I ordered Beef Ragu Pappardelle, which was a good blend of beef, sous-vide egg, and pasta. I was glad we ordered to share because it was very filling and I don't think I could've finished the entire pappardelle myself. My boyfriend ordered the Ribeye and Truffle Rice Bowl (+$6.00) - this was oh-so-good!!! The ribeye was done just right (medium rare), so tender and juicy! The truffle really made the rice bowl extra enjoyable, and the onsen egg tied in the flavours together so well.For desserts we both had the Wild Berry Pannacotta, very generous portion, ended off the dinner on an extremely delightful note.Service staff were attentive to the patrons, and got to the tables very quickly. They were all very polite as well, truly making this spontaneous dinner a very memorable one.Keep up the great work, we will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu
5
service is excellent! Dont forget to try their carbonara and ribeye truffle rice bowl, it's really the best in town. We tried their Mojito and Sangria to go with the food.Gonna bring my date the next time round
4
Had a great birthday gathering dinner. Server was attentive, and food was good. They even surprise my birthday son with a birthday song as they serve the cake i bough
5
Came here for dinner and shared a few main dishes with 5 friends. We really enjoyed the ribeye truffle bowl, carbonara and roast chicken. The Chilli cheese fries were also good for sharing! Love the ambience of the new revamped outlet. Service staff were also attentive and quick. Overall a very nice dining experience. Good place to impress your business associates too ;)Will be back for that ribeye!!!! :
5
Friends recommended the restaurant conveniently located in the city, Bugis. We had the Ribeye truffle gourmet rice and carbonara pasta. They were simply delicious! We enjoyed good food, and had a great time. I made a mental note to bring my date next round
5
Simple food made classy! The food serving are generous and definitely tasty with really beautiful plating. Thou its heavy on the tummy, it's light on the wallet. Food here are reasonably priced especially for a place like bugis. Highly recommended
5
Platypus kitchen never fails to amaze me with their value for money food selection. My favourite has to be their ribeye and truffle gourmet bowl. I like how each and every dish is carefully thought out and how every mouthful is flavorful. The service over at platypus is excellent as well, their staff and attentive and I never had to wait too long to be served

Rocked up with some mates for an early dinner, sharing a few plates between five persons, a bottle of wine and some cocktails. And it became one of our best meals on our visit to Singapore, good prices and excellent food!We sat by the windows, with a clear view of the action in the kitchen, it was enjoyable watching the chefs churn out food and cocktails to the rocking house music that they played. The 2 cocktails we ordered came first and the Asian inspired ones were amazing. So good! When the food came, we loved the clean presentation and the juicy almost unbelievably-tender grilled chicken just blew us away. The pastas were mostly fresh pastas with a little Asian twist. Once again very proper as well.The vibe of the restaurant is trendy although it does have a mainstream price point. And on top of it, service was wonderful, but it was early in the evening and not too crowded

Awesome food complemented by the lovely deco. The resultant ambience is perfect for a casual night out with friends or loved ones.I especially enjoyed the ribeye and truffle gourmet rice bowl, which constitutes generous servings of truffle and a nicely sou vide onsen. The beef was tender and well-seasoned too.Will definitely be back
5
Good service and ambience. The food is fresh, good and affordable. Head down to Platypus and pamper yourself
4
Comfy ambience that welcomes you. Simply delightful. And the food, if you are a dessert person you have to try their sticky date pudding, simply irresistible.
5
Ordered the cast iron grilled chicken with Korean spicy sesame sauce when I visited. The chicken was grilled to perfection, juicy, plump and tasty all at the same time. The sauce had the right amount of sweetness and spiciness, both combined with the fragrance of the toasted sesame to make it pure perfection. Will definitely come back again try the rest of the dishes

Visited the restaurant in Dec for gathering and the food quality is bad and the lobster roll is not fantastic
5
Good service and ambience. Price is cheap for the quality of food. would go back again for sure! recommend the duck confit and truffle carbonara!!!!!!!!
5
food is good. ambience is nice. friendly staff. location is convenient. food customization available which is awesome since im a vegetarian.

It was "Lo Yei" gathering last week with friends, this time we had something special, Yusheng from Platypus Kitchen at Bugis Junction, a combination of western and chinese style Yusheng that consists of cucumbers, pineapples, red daikon, walnuts, cranberries, mandarin oranges, crispy wanton, honey lemon, sesame seeds, white pepper and smoked salmon. It is said that the 12 auspicious ingredients of this Yusheng will bring prosperity for 12 months.Customers can do take away or dine in for the Yusheng. I placed my order one day in advance and collected it on the next day. Getting to the restaurant was so convenient as it is located along the stretch of restaurants opposite National Library. I was there during dinner hours and the restaurant was nearly full house. I like the ambience and decor of the restaurant plus their friendly and efficient staff always smiling. I will definitely go back with my friends to visit the restaurant to try out their other menus. As for the Yusheng, it is very innovative and impressive. Ingredients used were fresh, no preservatives and portion were generous. We love the Yusheng and will buy again
5
Nice environment with affordable pricing menu. Additional, stuff provided a good smile and it is impressing my love and I
5
Nice place, good food, good service, reasonable price. Will come back again for another meal soon. Check out their daily promotions for lunch and dinner
4
Great ambience, great service! a very good place to gather with your friends for birthday celebrations
5
The ribeye eye rice bowl was fantastic. Love the squid ink pasta, flavour was just perfect. Tried the cocktail yellow fever and soju agent, good value for the cocktail. Will definitely go again.
5
Ordered the take away Yu Sheng for 'Lo Hei'. Thought it was the usual traditional Chinese Yu Sheng but came the western style or rather innovative with rich mix of salads, pineapples, walnuts, cranberries, red daikon, mandarin oranges, cucumbers and top it up with salmons and roes. It was fresh, quality and looked appetizing. After mixing and tossing the traditional way, the overall taste was amazing and everyone who celebrated this 'Lo Hei' love it. The entire plate of Yu Sheng was empty in less than 10 minutes.Friends who have tasted it ask where can they buy it. Will make it a point to get Yu Sheng from this restaurant again
4
Above average food and prompt service. I would visit again just for the fries! They also offer affordable alcoholic drinks for as cheap as $5 (limited to one order per person). Definitely worth a try
5
We had lunch at platypus kitchen and my family loved it. Both service and food were impeccable and our family lunch was great value too. We hard a great time.The whole rosemary garlic chicken was one of the best we have tried. The skin was crisp and the meat was very succulent and moist. The rice bowls which were recommended were a little on the sweet side, but well done with delicious combinations.Our waitress was a friendly lady who was very knowledgable and she explained the restaurant specialities very patiently. She was very prompt with checking on us and made us feel comfortable
3
Visited the place with a bunch of colleagues. The atmosphere was great, but they didn't have big enough tables to accommodate 7 of us despite us making a booking in advance. We ended up being squashed in a corner. Regardless, the food was ok and we had an enjoyable time.
3
We ordered 3 dinber sets, 2 Rosemary Garlic Chicken, and the Crab Bucatini. The Crab Bucatini is something new to the taste, good but not really to rave about. What I like better is the Rosemary Chicken - big portion (can be shared by 2 people if you're not a big eater), juicy, fragrant, and tasty. My kids liked it too, so that's a plus point
5
Good ambience, food was good. Price was a bit expensive. Best truffle fries I had in Singapore.Service was great
5
Rustic environment that proved cosy and comfortable for family friends to gather in. Not to forget the wonderful variety of food that is unique and delectably created to thrill the taste buds. Have a try of the Ribeye Rice bowl, it fills and entices you to have more despite that filled tummy
4
We wanted a variety of food to try. So we ended up getting 2 set dinners and an extra appetizer. The food was good and the spring chicken portion was big. I would say the spring chicken can feed 2 instead of 1 given that I am not a small eater. But my friend's pasta was on the bland side. When we told the staff abt it they asked kitchen to cook us a new one. Service was impeccable. Overall everything was gd.
5
Great service, great ambience and great food. :-) Always my go-to place to dine at when I am near the area.
5
ordered the shaved truffles fries which were full of flavour and the platypus lobster roll (one of their specialities) which was generous in size. Loved the roasted garlic mayo too! definitely going back for more
5
Yummy, homey, family-style fare in a great location in the city area. The chicken was so moist, tender and flavourful. Cocktails were amazing as well!
5
I had dinner with a bunch of friends, they are quick to cater to our group of 10 peeps and I did not make any reservation prior to dining here. It was a last minute decision after the cinema. Service and food is good
5
great food for good value.large portion for the cast iron chicken.truffle rib eye bowl and other bowls are extremely tasty !Will be back
5
You will not get something, with the enviroment of the Restaurant, their ingredients used, self made pasta with wonderful presentation at this price in Singapor
5
It is a nice restaurant nestled in the middle of busy shopping scene. Service was great and they have live soft music playing.
4
The food was really good. The pasta was exquisite. And the drinks were to die for. I want more. Till today, I crave for their drinks.
5
Excellent food and services. Extremely polite staffs. Birthdays recognition inclusive by the boss himsel
5
The lobster rolls were pretty good. It wasn't the best I've tasted but for that price I have no complains. A word of advice, go for the Crustacean Rice Bowl to complement your lobster roll or have it on its own. IT IS A MUST TRY! This dish is a unique dish full of umami goodness. Boston lobster sits on top of rice, accompanied by sea urchin creme, honey ponzu and topped with caviar. Every mouth was filled with a messy satisfaction. I also loved the roasted pumpkin soup! It was one of the best I have tasted, complete with burnt cheddar and hickory bacon which gives a nice twist to the traditional pumpkin soup. They also have a variety of alcoholic drinks and are well-known for their sangria. Overall, a nice place to have dinner or drinks at. Would definitely patronize them again
3
I won't be going back to the restaurant again. But,it's just me. I went there upon recommendation from a friend. So,I brought my family there for a birthday dinner. I guess it wasn't up to my expectations. Perhaps,I'm not used to the kind of food served. The portions weren't that great for the price & my family members found the food just average or below average. The service was passable & the lady serving us was helpful. But, someone else will actually find the food good....unfortunately, it wasn't me.
4
Food is awesome. It's good for family or friend gathering place. We were also given some complimentary about that waiters who sent food and ordered seem not familiar of the menu.
5
I've been here twice with my girlfriends and we always ordered mains to share. Every single dish was tasty, our favourites were the onsen egg cabonara & soju bbq pork. We also love the ambience and the friendly staff. Platypus is one of the rare restaurants I would recommend to everyone if i'm looking for a good dinner place! Bringing my partner there next
4
Staff are friendly and food is nice. Ambiance was nice for gathering. Will recommend for next visit
4
The food is awesome! Definitely will bring my other friends to this restaurant to eat! The wait for food is abit long but totally worth it!
5
Had an awesome team lunch here and everything was on point. Had the set lunch special with a luxurious pumpkin soup and a sundried tomato chicken pasta which fueled my soul. Service was a little slow at first, but an elderly waitress was quick to make things right. On top of that, they surprised us with complimentary truffle fries.Will definitely be back in the near future
5
I visited this place in a big group and ordered a large variety of food and drinks. Everything we ordered was good with amazing consistency. The drinks were all well done. Awesome place for a great night out
5
The food served met my expectations. And despite myself making a mistake in ordering, the staff gladly changed my order to my desired one.
3
Had a dinner date with SO for our proposal/engagement anniversary. The ambience was a little bit noisy but it was still okay. Food was average and a little overpriced. Felt that we were eating Singapore's Italian version of mee pok noodles because it was the kind of eggy noodles. Didn't expect it to be 'al dente' anyway. Service was okay. Overall, nothing stood out and it was fairly average. Expected better.
5
The customer service was fantastic! I wanted to surprise my lil sis for her birthday and the server was more than happy to help. Food was awesome and the best thing they had $6 happy hour cocktail for the first drink. I really wanted to order more of their dishes but the ones my family and I had were so filling! Will definitely come back again for their other dishes! And I can't stop gushing about the servers being so spontaneous in singing a birthday song not once but twice for my lil sis - it helped that the other diners were also feeling the vibe and joined in. Thank you for the wonderful experience
4
great place and really humungous portions of good food. The staff are very kind and helpful. Its a hard core meat place. There are a few vegetarian option on the menu as well. they have an extended happy hour and it offers a nice experience overall
4
Nice ambience, nice atmosphere, delicious food. Went there especially to try the Lobster Roll. Came out to be nice, but I think the portion of the serving is a bit too small to be considered a main course. With that size, it could have been appetizer or starter, but overall is good
4
The food is amazing with nice drinking. The beef is awesome! One thing to improve is to give customers more options during Christmas. Now only Christmas set provided. Also a good location at bugis. Excellent for meeting friends
4
Atmosphere: mixed due to location and timing.The time where I was there,it was daytime and expect bustling traffic which affect dining mood.Food and drinks: Great choice of Moscato they have,sweet,and fragrant. Should try their Pumpkin Soup.Staff: Polite and provide great service. great knowledge on wine too.But,hiccups while billing,which can be improve.Post feedback response:Marvellous.Platypus has great experience,but I will want to expect more in looking forward to them exploring into creating the Platypus DNA
3
Platypus Kitchen is a bustling place on a Friday night but their staff are still polite and provide good service. Their truffles fries is quite nice but I am not too impressed by their lobster bowl, it was sweet and came in really petite portion.
3
This is an average place. Nothing out of the ordinary or for which you should really look forward to...
4
Comfortable setting. Good variety of mains. Service is solid. Air conditioning a tad strong though but will definitely come back.

Before entering the restaurant there is a large sign that says $8 for 1st coctail. Better yet On the main menu it states first coctail is $6 all day everyday! We of course ordered a coctail which ended up arriving 10 minutes after we finished our meal. Our pappardelle pasta dishes were cold and and overpriced for what they were. The largest dissappointment was when we recieved our bill. My partner and I were both charged $16 each for our coctails. I questioned the waitress and she said the $6 coctails were only for their tiny "holiday" menu which was never explained by the server when we first arrived. We also ate there on Jan 2nd which was not a holiday. Staff need to better inform their customers of any drink or food specials so there is no confusion and the retaurant should not be using false advertising outside to lure customers inside
5
Went there on a Saturday night without a booking. Got a table straight away. Service was a bit slow had to raise my hand to get some attention but after that all good. They have a special drink offer:half price for your first drinks (wine/beer).My boyfriend choses the chicken and it was awesome but a bit undercooked in the middleMyself I opted for the $24.90 menu they had which came with a choice of an entrée - main & desserts. All of them were awesome!ragu beef paste one of the best I had!chocolate lave cake yummy yummy yumm
4
Visited this place for a coffee after lunch this week at the recently opened Platypus Foodbar outlet in Changi Business Park. The only real alternatives in the area are the ubqiuitous chain coffee places, so this makes for a nice change. The coffee and the service were both pretty good. Only disappointment was an absence of any "coffee art" in my cappuccino (which one tends to get at some of the smaller non-chain coffee places). Worth a visit
4
They serve a wide range of western food and I recommend the lobster roll and the mushroom risotto. It is cheaper compared to its counterpart restaurants but Platypus Kitchen serves better food except for the soup and salad side dish (that comes with the meal) which I didn't really like
2
Although we have read numerous reviews about the service at the restaurant, my friends and I decided to give it a try for a Saturday lunch. Reservation was made (though not necessary) and after seating, the staff did not recommend anything during our order and we were given a set dinner menu (during lunch). The staff however mentioned that we would get a free lobster roll as we booked through a certain site, but coming back 10 minutes later saying it was not applicable as it was only for dinner (please know your promotions before even mentioning it to your customers).Cups for water were dirty, service was slow, draggy and the staff seemed unmotivated to work.Food wise, lobster roll set was one of the cheapest in town, though they came in small pieces rather in chunks, no complains. The truffle fried was good as the fries were nice on their own, however the little cup that the mayo was served in was a plastic broken shot-glass like cup - the staff did not even check before serving us.At the end of the meal, we decided to have desserts, no one was around to take the order and I had to order it at the bar counter and was told, there was only carrot cake (2 sad looking slices in the fridge display and nothing else) and chocolate mousse. We declined.I have to agree with the other reviewers on the service and food. I will NOT visit this restaurant & its chain again
3
Platypus Kitchen Did not meet my expectation dinner was such a disappointment,. I’m not even sure how to rate my visit,. The service had little to be anticipated with doomed looking lot of waiters. Staff Waiters where in another planet. Entrée and main was just coming from all direction, not even had a change to enjoy the entree. I personally won't be recommending the visit; maybe in the distant future it may improve. But for now whoever is managing this institution needs to review their style and attitude towards their customer
3
 Like most great places to eat in Singapore this one had the potential to be one of those hidden gems also, but fail on several levels. 1st terrible service! 2nd food. Steak was awful- tough, fatty. Couldn't cut it with the knife they provided. Basically unedible. Crustacean Bowl- which is basically lobster with rice honey & butter. So sweet all one could taste was the honey. This item should have been on the dessert menu. Couldn't even taste the Llobster. Prices are high, services is terrible and the food was just bad! We ended up ordering their truffle fries just to eat something . On a side note...the truffle fries were great! So if you're in the area and craving truffle French fries I highly recommend this place - other than that not worth the cab fair
2
The service had little to be desired with unhappy looking lot of waiters except for one older gentleman. Our order was taken by a sulky girl who was simply not engaging and had ignore how I might like my steak done. We were still having our soup when the waiter brought our main course. He looked pretty bemused when we commented that we were not quite ready for the main course. He decided to stand by our table carrying my main course, expecting me to finish up my soup there and then. Pathetic!! Regrettably, the soup and main course were slightly over salted. Both desserts were presentable and tasty. Platypus Kitchen was recommended to us by my daughter and her husband. We like to believe we must have chosen a bad platypus kitchen night but we won't be recommending it to our friends. By the way, they had novel way of collecting your bill. At 9.30pm a waitress stacks up all the bill folders and brings it to our table and presents our bill for payment whilst were still finishing our meal. Whoever is managing this establishment needs to review their style and attitude towards their customers
5
I've been here a few times for lunch over the last year. They seem to change their menu quiet often unlike other chain establishments in Singapore. That's pretty refreshing.The steak sandwich for lunch was superb! a Generous amount of well seasoned steak.I had the pumpkin soup (soup of the day) and it was luxurious and creamy. And at 17 bucks its a steal considering how pricey restaurants can get in Singapore.Definitely two thumbs up in my book
2
I ordered 2 of their specialty dishes which are the lobster roll, which taste very average not tasty at all compared to the lobster rolls from else where. And the other dish is the mushroom risotto which is very mushy, not fresh, they took out our dish in 5mins... Feels like it had been sitting in the kitchen for way too long and they just reheated it for us. Bacon bits is a bit chewy, I think you probably can find better one else where. Service is ok. Not very impress by this place
4
I tried Platypus Food Bar @ NUS today, located in the Faculty of Science at the National University of Singapore, Block S16. They've taken over the premises formerly occupied by Megabytes Cafe. It's a good deal for lunch. At S$5.50, you get a small bowl where they pile on the lettuce salad, corn and pasta and you get to choose 2 mains/sides (I opted for the salmon and rice). Not fantastic dining, but good value for a healthy lunch
3
We found the light beer with fruit interesting, refreshing and reasonably priced.The dark hot chocolate was just warm but was delicious. The Duck confit with garlic and penne with sun-dried tomato pesto was tasty.The garden garden salad had a nice dressing.The place was fairly empty but the staff did not really seem attentive.There is hardly anything vegetarian to eat
2
For starters, we had the Bacon + Roasted Pumpkin soup which was absolutely disappointing. It was tasteless and the ultimate turn off for this soup was the temperature. There was hardly any warmth in it, sadly. The Scallop Squid-ink Risotto was a tad too salty that night, else it would have been pretty good. Not too sure if we ordered the wrong thing but honestly, I dont think I will return.
3
premise - nice and big but emptylocation - bugis and so parking and commute is easy!!!staff - nice and friendly but tend to like talking among themselvescrowd - empty... only 5 tables usedfood - NO.... nope.... nahh..... didnt enjoy it 1 bitverdict - they said the other outlet was better ... cant remember which so will try again. but we'll see?

Warning: do not come here if you are expecting ‘pure’ Italian food. The apparent profusion of truffles might scream Umbria or Piedmont but the dishes, with free abandon, fuses the cuisines of Umbia, Piedmont, with those of Tuscany, Campania etc with an added twist of ‘Singlish’ as well.Having said that, I rather enjoyed the meal. We started with truffle fries and a rocket salad (only 2 starters for the three of us as a concession to ‘fatty fries’ ha). The fries really surprised. It was not just some truffle oil sprinkled on the fries but had slices of real truffles. Not the best truffles (what do you expect for a $6 dish), but it added an earthy background that allowed the potato to actually speak (I think they were saying we are russets!!). The rocket was reasonably fresh but the parmesan wow – surely not a stravecchio and I swear there was beads of moisture on the slices. The other surprise was the fresh pasta. Very well cooked. It was neither snappy or chewy or soft or mushy. Maybe it was fluke (three times in a row?) but this is al dente. The three pastas we had were:a. Squid ink – an earthiness with a mouth feel that rivaled the truffle in the starter providing a round sensation on the palate. Probably not full enough for a true gourmet but good enough for me.b. Vodka crème – that American Italian favorite with a citrus sharpness, alcohol bitterness enough cream to smooth out and soften both. My favorite.c. Spicy seafood – and it was spicy. I think it would get the thumbs down from most Italian eaters but for the heaters on our table the burn sensation provided a dramatic contrast.Then anther pleasant surprise - the price. I will definitely come again

Yesterday was my second visit to Platypus Kitchen with friends from out of town. For an early Saturday evening, the restaurant was fairly empty so service was fast.I had the set meal with pumpkin soup and sun-dried tomato pesto pasta. The soup was thick and good although I would have enjoyed it more if the pumpkin was slightly more roasted for a fuller flavour. The pasta tasted somewhat fusion-y as it reminded me of butter chicken with pasta - it was delicious with a bit of spicy kick, but not what you would expect from the menu description.We also ordered truffle fries to share - the chef must have held back on the truffle this time as previously it was absolutely aromatic with truffle oil and a pleasure. It still was good, vut the first time was better.I would still come back to Platypus Kitchen for the truffle fries and set meals
2
The atmosphere was decent..except for the ugly red wiring lighting on the ceiling. Those were extremely eye-plugging.Came with my family to celebrate my mother's birthday. The Pork Belly was decent. Everything else was not memorable. Garlic prawn sides lack flavor. It needed more olive oil, garlic and chilli padi but it lacked all that to give any good taste.But the worse was their Diablo crab pasta which is by far one of the worse dishes I have ever tasted. The sauce tasted like plastic sauce with plastic residue left all over it.It was as though the sauce was wrapped in plastic for 50 years before they decided to use the sauce. Me and my little sister didn't eat pass 20% of that dish, It was horrendous! The lack of olive oil during cooking left much of our pasta stuck to each other like lumps and the plastic sauce destroyed all form of flavor for the other components.My bother's scallop risotto was good, but had too much peas inside. Instead of being a component meant to balance and sweeten the flavor a bit, the peas overpowered everything else in the dish. My bro was a big eater and still bothered to eat everything. That was his only feedback.The fact that Platypus had no coffee of tea to serve (finished or can't be done) was a horrible sign for the lack of preparedness for a Sunday lunch. My parents were cold due to the air-conditioning and the lack of hot coffee or tea only made our experience worse.I gave my feedback to a male service staff whose name I do not know how to spell. Barely wrote my thoughts on a paper which in my opinion requires fixing. A small feedback form with three lines....what can I even write for feedback? What was the management thinking when they made the feedback form? Were they smoking crack thinking constructive feedback can be written in only 3 pathetic lines in a small piece of paper? Grow a brain for gods sake!Service wasn't that great a start. No optimism, lack of man-power obviously which made everything feel mundane.But despite all the hated problems I have with this first visit, the male service provider was kind enough to listen to my feedback on what needs fixing, from the menu size, to the cooking of the horrendous pasta and how to make it better. All I can hope for is that the kitchen cooks bother to listen to what I shared and fix their damn dishes.At the end after payment, the male service provider gave us a chocolate ice-cream cake as complimentary for the trouble. A gesture I greatly appreciated. At the very least, my parents and siblings were able to enjoy something out of the much negative experience.Though small, it's the thought that counts and that is where service help give light to a dying restaurant and maybe a second chance. I give my kudos to that male service provider. He listened, and tried to salvage a bad experience with whatever he could do and though it can't fix the bigger problems, he didn't let us leave extremely bitter about our experience.A decent service that can become better over time if given more power to the crew.But a poor performance from the kitchen. Screw the food and save your money for other experience. Italian food with Spanish influence with a disastrously huge menu and pathetic quality in cooking. What a shame
5
Loved the pastas, Hubby ordered the spicy ragu and I ordered the Truffle carbonara. Both were very good and portions were generous. Only the wilde mushroom soup had too strong a garlic taste. The ambience and decor was tastefully done. Music choice was relaxed and not too loud. Conducive for a nice chat. The service was very efficient, we got a table pretty fast (because we made reservations) and the food was also served pretty fast. But the young waitor was struggling when serving as he carried too many plates on his tray. Perhaps he shouldn't be so ambitious next time.Price was very affordable and reasonable. I would definitely go again!
3
This has the potential to be a great restaurant. Nice ambience, tables are set far enough from one another for some privacy and the set meals are good value. I've been there twice in Nov , once at 4pm (only 1 other table around) and the other time during lunch hour. Both times, the younger service staff are very lackadaisical and seem to avoid eye contact instead of wanting to serve.My dessert was also served with (a) a plate that almost toppled onto the table and (b) the knife that actually fell vertically from the server's tray onto the table. I'm fine with (a) but not with (b). As there was only 1 other table occupied and the server wasn't carrying anything else, that was really slipshod.The elderly gentleman on the first visit was the best and most courteous. I enjoy the salad that comes with the sets and enjoy the variety of drinks that are offered as part of the set. The mains are also varied enough for you to be happy with. I'd advise sticking with the standard pasta dishes and skip those heavy on seafood. They're not all that fresh (but for that price, one can't expect too much) and the prawns are shrimps.Both times I was with different colleagues and they both also noted the poor service and difficulty in getting their attention. If I'm not rushing for time it's not make or break, but for business lunches or if I'm rushing for time, absolute no-no
