Visited the new outlet in Tan Quee Lan street for lunch this week. The advantage of that outlet is that it's not too busy and so it's easy to get a seat. Noodles are just as tasty as the original outlet. Worth another visit.

Great mazesoba with tasty toppings! Not a common ramen dish you can find so it's something worth trying. Portion is big and value for money too!

I had the nagoya style mazesoba with all toppings and it was absolutely delectable. It came with char siew, pork belly, deep fried chicken, onsen egg and bamboo shoots. Mix it all up and slurp away! They also offer complimentary larger servings of noodles for big eaters. Try to get here earlier if you intend to have dinner here. I managed to get a table immediately when I arrived before 7pm but a queue formed outside the restaurant by the time I finished eating

I tried their signature dish mazesoba ramen at anddd they served me that noodle minus the seaweed. Thing is... I just realised it after making payment and so the manager in charge just verbally said sorry and will give more. I'm definitely not eating here again. Taste like instant noodle with so much spring onion, bleh! The egg was even cold.

It was my first time trying a dried version ramen and unfortunately it's not to my liking. Be fair, it's very nice ramen noodles with springy texture but the sauce is not special. It tastes just similar like singapore bak cho mee. I'd go back to soupy ramen instead. My accompanion and i both agreed that we will not try mazesoba again. One thing to mention about the service - i was waiting in line to be served a table while the waitress was busy, later on a group a people came behind me and the waitress just skip me and serve the group. I talk to the waitress again that i need a table, she doubted me and served the group first. It wasnt pleasant.

I was there yesterday (Sunday) for dinner with my brother at 5:30pm. We were the only customers until a couple walked in.The genmai tea was free. I had the large original Mazesoba which cost $12.90 while my brother had Mazesoba with soft boiled egg. He, too had the large portion. Upsize is free which makes it really value for money. I managed to finish the entire bowl of Mazesoba and felt very fulfilling.The prices on menu have to include service charge. No GST was charged

SO HAPPY there's a pretty legit aburasoba in CBD!!! I tried the mazesoba with all toppings and wasn't disappointed, texture and taste are really good! Whenever I used to go to Tokyo I would go have aburasoba but that craving is now well taken care :) You can choose to have upsized noodles free of charge which makes a pretty big and filling bowl! Make sure to add the vinegar and the spicy sauce. Free mugicha (cold barley tea

I love their Mazesoba and frequent them at least monthly. If you are a big eater, you can opt for 1.5x portion for free. If you still have leftover sauce after finishing the ramen, do request for a spoon of Japanese rice to eat with.Seats are limited so do try to reach before 7pm for weekday dinner

@TheKuoKnowsWe often think of Japanese ramen as noodles swimming in a bowl of soup. But Kajiken has put paid to that idea.Who would have thought it possible that Japanese ramen could be served dry, and still taste so good? Kajiken does, and it's right.The signature Mazesoba Nagoya Style is something to feast your eyes on. The vibrant green layer of chopped vegetables and a perfect lava egg sits atop perfectly cooked noodles.It's difficult not to tuck in straight away. But Kajiken recommends a 20-second rule, which means that the ingredients should be mixed for a full 20 seconds before eating.That might just be a gimmick. But the superb taste of chili oil mixed with vinegar speaks for itself. Fantastic

my favourite soba place in Tanjong pagar - good for a (very heavy) lunch. The noodles is chewy, minced meat is well-marinated with addictive taste. You get free flow ice tea or ice water, and a bowl of chicken soup. Chilli and vinegar are available on every table for mixing. Suggest to add vinegar in the dry spicy noodles, it enhances the flavour. Their dry noodles taste similar to singapore Mince meat noodles (Bak Chor Mee).note : CASH payment onl

So much Flavours and taste in one bowl! You can also upsize your noodle for free! Love it so much ❤️

Came here for a second time this week and tried one of their noodle dishes. This was accompanied by a small soup and was fresh and tasty. Service was friendly and efficient. Happy to return again.

We ordered mazesobu, fried chicken, char siew and braised pork. All very good. Unfortunately, it's a rather small outlet and seats are limited. Overall worth the wait.

Be prepared to wait at least 20min during dinner time for takeaway. No designated waiting area. Have to wait standing on the pedestrian walkway outside.

We ordered one mazesoba nagoya and one mazesoba with all toppings.
Enjoyed the nagoya a lot more! Everything in the bowl complemented one another!

It was a tiny outlet located at Orchid Hotel with a service staff and 2 kitchen staffs. It was well known for its dry style of ramen. The place was not crowded, comparing to its crowded neighbours during dinner time. Only cash was accepted for payment. There was ice tea on the table to help yourself to. Sitting at the counter, one could easily see how the cook prepare the food.Mazesoba Nagoya style (S$12.80++)Dry noodle with spicy minced pork, soft boiled egg, seaweed, and some vegetablesThere was a note pasted on the table, with instructions on how to eat the noodle.1) Mix the ingredients for 20 seconds2) Want more kick? Add vinegar or chilli oil!3) Finish eating? Ask "OiMESHI!" to staff! The staff would give a small portion of rice to mix with the remaining sauce!The noodle was served with a small cup of soup. The soup was peppery in taste and reminded one of bak kut teh. The noodle was addictive and slightly spicy with a slight QQ texture. Better than most bak chor mee. Mixing the remaining sauce with the plain rice, it was delicious too

This shop has only one page menu. The main dry ramen is the bomb. Free upsize for big eater. They provide free drinks too. Worth the price, and good food. Had been here for 3times. Its a stop and go place. Good for lunch and dinner

I am not a ramen person but this dry ramen has turned me into a dry ramen person LOL. I kept going back for weeks! I didn't have it at the restaurant for the first time as i ordered delivery. Tanjong Pagar branch offers delivery during weekends. I was hooked since then. I have tried the Square 2 at Novena and the one at Tanjong Pagar. Try not going after 12pm for all of the branches that I have mentioned. Best timing is before 12pm or after 2pm. Don't forget about the rice which will be given after your ramen. The branch at Square 2 will offer you the rice but for Tanjong Pagar, you will have to request.

Second Ramen dinner in a row, second five stars. Maybe i just found a new love and that is messing my judgement, but it tasted to me damn good. I tried the dry Ramen with all the toppings and the Noodle upsize. At first the marvelous broth was missing but there was some in the bottom and the ingredients were just great. And the egg running in the noodles just made my day.

This little Japanese restaurant is located nearby tanjong pagar mrt station, within walking distance. Since the restaurant is small, you must go early as there will be crowd form during dinner time. The space is cramp but that does not affect the atmosphere. The dry ramen is something new, this is the first time we have tried it and it is very delicious. You can choose to free upgrade the noodle to a bigger size and they are more than happy to cook a very big bowl for you. The serving is fast and there is free cold tea available. There are a few flavours available and I will definitely be back to try on the others. Highly recommended to try
