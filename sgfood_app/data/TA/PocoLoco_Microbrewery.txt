Love the place and the service are great!! I love the pasta and the green beer!! I recommend all my friends to PocoLoco
5
Food is excellent, very flavourful and quantity is just right. Reasonable waiting time for food upon order and service from the staffs are good and responsive.
4
A great corner to relax, chill and cheers with the freshly brewed beer. Away from the busy town centre. Squid ink pasta and all beers are wonderful. Worth another visit soon.
5
This place is a great place to eat away from the busy city. Reasonably priced and all my orders taste great!
2
Really enjoyed my dinner. Pasta was delicious. Friendly service staff. Definitely recommended and will be back.
4
The food was surprisingly delicious and the service was pretty good even though we went on new year's eve and the place was fully booked. Enjoyed the experience and would love to return to try the other food in the menu.
5
service is not too bad looking at the crowd. Food is good & tasty. Environment is clean & tidy. Service is a little slow, but based on the crowd present, it's actually up to expectation.

Went to this place as recommended by my friend. I scanned their instagram geotag to see if the food is nice and they seem okay so we went. Located in the Snow City which looked very dull and dark. We ordered Manzo, okay with a hint of truffle - just a little hint. My friend got the Pescatora - it looked better. We got the Vongole and Caesar salad. The vongole is very plain, almost tasteless and the salad dressing is not nice. It felt more sinful than the pasta. For dessert, we got the lava cake - too small for $10.90 which tasted average. Ordered bottled water for $2 each. Overall, including the place, not worth going at all. Id rather go to more accessible cafes or restaurant
2
Tiramisu was the biggest disappointment. It was probably the worst tiramisu we've ever tasted. Came here specially to try the "authentic Italian tiramisu". However, there was no alcohol and coffee in it. Lady's fingers were dry & hard and served together with cream cheese. Staff noted on our feedback and alerted their chef/ chef assistant. We were at least expecting either an apology or a confession that it was their mistake. No response was received after that. Definitely will not re-visit again. There are many restaurants out there offering comparable prices & better food and service quality
5
Must try the carpaccio! Thankful we reserved a spot or we might not have been able to get a place. There was some kid's birthday celebration going on there. (oh no, word is getting out!) We weren't able to get a seat indoors for that reason, but the outdoor seating area was also surprisingly peaceful
5
Had our Christmas dinner at PocoLocco. Perfect place for gatherings and we would definitely return again for the steak and foir gras!
4
I had one of my best tiramisu in town! The beer was also good but can have more selection in future!
4
Great food for the price. everyone can find something on the menu to eat. Will be better if have greater selection of beer.
5
Quality seems to have dropped a little since I first started coming here early this year, but it's still great value for money nonetheless. Definitely a place to go for quality and very affordable pasta.
5
Really like this quaint place. Great food, nice ambience. Good place to meet friends and for family dinners.
3
I can eat two of those!
Be sure to send an email or call or chope your seat. They are always fully booked. Why? Even this is one of the cheapest Italian restaurant in Singapore, they doesn’t compromise the taste of the food they serve.
4
We ordered two pastas, the crab pink sauce was too salty to our liking. The carbonara was not bad. The bruschetta and mushroom soup was delicious and unfortunately, the waitress did not record our order of the scallops. When we asked for it, it did not arrive at all and they were not apologetic. Given that they were busy, I will give them another chance and will visit again. Hopefully, next round would be better.
3
food was a hit and miss.. the pasta menzo was good, catch of the day was seabream was good. was disappointed over the beef with foie gras in rossini sauce.. there was no foie gras, the dish was very late in being served as we have to remind them about it, the beef was overdone and this was the priciest of all i believe. overall a 3 as the price was good but my companions will not go back again
5
Been wanting to try this restaurant since it opened some time back, and finally got to try it last Friday. It’s such a hidden gem serving delicious and authentic Italian food. Prices are really reasonable too ($10 for a plate of pasta!). I also loved that it was a microbrewery and I was able to get good quality fresh beer for a low price! Would highly recommend this place!My only complaint was the dessert tiramisu had crunchy bits of biscuits that didn’t seemed soaked enough...
3
We got the mozzarella, which was actually a deep fried grilled cheese, grilled chicken salad, mussels, and a pasta dish with beef and a cream sauce. The grilled cheese was actually quite good, as was the salad, the pasta was decent as well. The mussels had an off flavor and we're not good. They have 2 beers on tap, $8 per half pint which isn't bad for Singapore, the lager chiaro had a banana like flavor which isn't style appropriate. (To the brewery, if you read this, it can likely be fixed by increasing pitch rate and stretching out your primary fermentation). The lager birra was pretty good though. The color of the two beers were identical, so it was hard to tell them apart without tasting. All in all, it's a decent place to grab a bite if you're nearby, but not a destination place
3
Food was reasonably good. However, they are quite pricey comparatively. Beer was good. As for coffee, it was above average. On the whole, it was an enjoyable evening. But parking at the restaurant premise was exorbitant.
5
Very friendly and prompt customer service from the waitresses. Food was top notch and authentically Italian. Would definitely visit again. Hope the green beer would be back soon!
5
I have been a regular to PocoLoco. There is a brewery and the food is of good quality. I will strongly recommend this restaurant to all.
2
The ambience was nice but not so for food. The serving was small and some of the food doesn't taste well.
4
Nice food and a cosy place to dine but waiting time can be long during weekends. An overall good experience visiting this place for the first time. Pasta seems like a popular order among the guests. Appertisers were good.
5
The service attendants are all very attentive, and they have recommended an excellent catch of the day, the Garoupa, which are our favourite dish that dinner.
5
Although the location was a little out of the way if you don't drive, the food and service was good.
5
Good for those staying or working in the west side, no need to brace the traffic to head downtown for good food and drinks
4
Nice italian food coupled with microbrewery beer. Beer selection is abit limited and only available in half pint. Food wise am very satisfied with the pasta, portion is good. Would like the restaurant to provide clearer indications of its location at snow city though, would not have such easy time finding it if not for another person leading the way
5
location is slightly hidden / out of place BUT doesn't mean there is no crowd! Went on Friday night and luckily made a reservation earlier. Otherwise, need to queue for some time probably. I was there around 7+pm and the crowd was building up.Food wise, they have great pastas and mains! But the beer are the bomb! Will be back
5
I love the ambience n the food is simply awesome especially the steak with the foie gras! Really capture my heart n the staff is polite n attentive.Will be back for more...
5
Firstly the food were all great, the staff made great recommendation and had initiative towards kids.
5
This place serves very cold beer that stays cold due to the holder. Good for family with kids too. Nice atmosphere.
4
though abit noisy from the crowds, overall a pleasant experience, surprise to see many family with kids.
beer is nice
4
I had a team dinner here.
Beer and food are nice.
The place is pretty small so advanced booking is advised.
5
It was my friend's birthday and we wanted to try something different. The place is hidden on top of Snow City and not very crowded during a Monday lunch. The service was excellent and the food was wonderful. Great place!
4
Love the pasta here. Tried both AMK and Science Centre outlets and both side serves good pasta! At science centre outlet, they have freshly brewed beer!
3
Food was okay only. Ordered squid ink pasta there's only a few squid. Porcini risotto was also average. The tiramisu which was supposed to be very good was also average. Service was good though.
3
Visited Pocoloco twice, and both visits yielded the same conclusion.The food served is decent to good, portions are a bit small though.My personal favorites are the lamb rack, chicken cordon bleu and the mushroom soup.Now comes the biggest problem, the is a lack of coordination of the food order. 1) Many times the staff had brought a food order that had been served.2) Orders missed.3) During peak hours, long wait times for food; and it does not help that ordered were missed.This place has potential, my advise to others would be (a) make reservations, (b) be patient.For the owners of this place, I think you are over stretching yourself by having both indoor and outdoor seating.Your kitchen and staff are unable to cope with the number of orders coming in.Please have someone who coordinate and ensure the kitchen is able to fulfill the orders timely and in the right sequence.This problem, have lost this place 1 star and might possibly lose one more if not for the food quality
4
One can almost this microbrewery as it was hidden on the 2nd floor with not so obvious signage. The menu was simple with about 30+ items and 4 in-house brews.Food was (too) quick and they are arrived together. The portions are small and its qualities are of high average. Service was prompt and friendly. The brews were above average though priced well. They also have an Alfresco area which was pretty nice especially for the smokers. Overall, a nice outfit for family.
3
I believe they took over the previous microbrewery. Beers seemed to be the similar as what was offered previously. The good thing would probably be it is kind of a "hidden gem" in the west.
4
A place for affordable and excellent pasta for folks in Jurong. Pasta are cooked al dente, portion wise slightly small but priced very reasonably.
4
PocoLoco is a great place to go to for a decent Italian pasta without burning a hole in your pocket! The friendly staff makes the meal really enjoying. You can add a beer/ cider to compliment the meal. Will recommend for get-together with friends!
5
Great place with very quality food and quality craftsbeer. Highly recommend the beef cheek and the house golden ale.
5
Loved how prices were kept low at less than $15 a pasta, with no service charge too! Staff were friendly and service was good. Walkable from je mrt
4
Nice casual ambience. Food taste good. However, quantity is a little too small. The finger food - sauteed mushroom is the most awesome with some light truffle smell. Love that e most. Gamberi prawn is nice too!
5
Great place for a casual dinner. Generous portions for the Budget friendly price. Should make reservations as it can get quite busy.
2
You would expect seafood pasta to have a briny taste but it wasn't. It tasted fishy and not fresh, the prawns were to the point of mushy. The seafood risotto should be using the same stock because it had the same problem. The only redeeming grace was the calamari which was fried well with light batter. If the waiter had asked me how was my food, I would be most happy to let them know. Sadly they didn't.
3
Love the food at Pocoloco Microbrewery. Tried the Foie Gras Risotto, Granchio (Crabmeat in pink sauce) and calamari. I just love the calamari sauce, it was sour and a little spicy. Felt that it was really refreshing to the taste buds. Please choose your pasta wisely as some of you might not like the creamy pasta cause you might be sick of it after a few mouthfuls. As for the service, we had a hard time trying to call the waiters over to order our food, we waited for quite some time before gaining their attention. This might be due to shortage of staffs?
2
Expected the food to be value for money. But portions were so tiny (esp for appetizers e.g. 16 for a small bunch of rockets, 2 blobs of feta cheese and some Parma ham). Portions for pasta and main courses were small too. Waitress was unfamiliar with the menu and we had to repeat ourselves a few times to clarify our order. However, besides the portions, the food was alright. Disappointed cos I read great reviews online.. maybe that led to high expectations? Overall, felt like it was not worth the trip esp since it's quite out of the way..
5
An accidental find. Food is excellent and reasonably priced! We had the pastas. $12++ for a reasonable portion.
4
Wonderful Italian lunch at such reasonable prices! Very Family friendly too! We will definitely return again!
4
Food was good, beer was OK not fantastic. Price point is good. Place needs a reno, due to the wooden furniture.
5
Really chill place with beers they brew themselves. Great pricing and good food. Be sure to order their beers!
4
The food was not good bad and the price was reasonable. However, the service/waiting time was mediocre as there were too many patrons and too few servers.
4
Tasty food eg starter of escargot and cheese. Wagyu beef main course was a tad too done as I ordered medium doneness. Some fries or mash potato to go with the main course of beef and mackerel would have been better.
4
Excellent food and convenient parking. Value for money as well as it was reasonable price for the quality of food.
3
Went back to this restaurant with a few friends and while the mains are good, we found the desserts rather disappointing. First they tended to be too sweet - good desserts like chocolate lava should give you the real taste of cocoa and not just SWEET. The meringue was like nothing we have eaten before - mushy in texture instead of a delicately crispy icing topping. The panacotta was reasonable and lava cake would have been better if it were not so sweet.It's still generally a good value restaurant with reasonable service. Stick to pastas and risottos and meats and you will be fine. Just stay away from the desserts if you are not someone who likes things really sweet
2
Disappointed with their portioning especially rock melons w parma ham at $7. They cut the ham into thin strips and 5 pcs of melon cubes. Also do not order the mushroom soup because it comes in a pathetic small bowl at $4 estimate under 10 scoops of a soup spoon. For main course, I ordered a chicken tender w/masala wine at $15 consists of 4 small pieces of breast chicken. Lastly the carbonara at $11 only 4 small bits of bacon. However beer is good, food is definitely not value for money. I read from a blogger site and commented affordable in heartland which I disagree 
4
No fuss, delightful dinner for two. We ordered:A light beer (delicious!)Sprite (for the driver)Veal (so-so)Vongole penne white wine with clam (good)Calamari (rubber band chewy squid, good dipping sauce though)Fungi (good)Nice friendly staffs, cosy environment. The place is on the second floor of snowcity.Very easy on the pocket.We are eagar to return and try out other items on their menu.J
4
Love PocoLoco's food selection thats delicious but still affordable. However, i was seated in the outdoor area and was bitten by insects.
5
We love coming back here because the food is great, affordable, value for money and great ambience! Service is prompt as well.
4
Overall a value for money place. The chilled melon soup was a delight. Perhaps a tad understaffed for a weekend dinner.
3
Most appetisers we had were below average. Speghetti were better. Service was pretty slow as well...
5
The shop is situated in snow city itself so can be a little hard to find. Otherwise, the food taste good and are affordable. Nothing special about the ambience of the place but there's a place for alfresco dining too.
4
Quite out of the way, but good food and unique home brew beer. Went especially for the beer! Decent atmosphere.
4
Been here a few times now, and everything been great. good food, friendly staff, tastey beer. Haven't tried dessert on any occasion, as always order a few starters to share followed by main course and a few jugs of beer. Plan, book and enjoy!!
5
Had a yummy and budget friendly meal at the snow city outlet. Pasta (tried the granchio and manzo) and tagliata di manzo were awesome - must try!
3
Before entering this place, one might thought that they got the wrong address. Food wise was good, mushroom soup was tasty and portion for the other food was appropriate. Desert was a letdown and you can do without it. If you are into microbrewery, they have affordable beer for you. The place is not huge and do make reservation if you are coming in large group during dinner hour.
5
The atmosphere is very low budget but the service is good and the food comes fast. The food itself is really very good. I liked everything I've tried so far. The appetizers were great (my favorite was the shrimp and the beef carpaccio) and the pastas were really good. Desserts weren't bad either! They have matcha lava cake!!! To top it all off, the price was very affordable
4
Food was really worth the value and the genuinity in the italian cuisine prepared can definitely be felt.
4
PocoLoco Microbrewery offers good food and nice beer at affordable prices. There is a lot of room for improvement for service and ambience though.
5
My second time here, sat at the outdoor tables at sunset time as well -- love that it's private and quiet with a stunning view of the sunset sky, plus affordable and delicious food.
5
The staff called shortly after our booking. They follow up through and make sure that we get the seat that we want. The food presentation is good and food is yummy. Selection of beer is good too with my favorites Chianti.
4
First time here for dinner, it's a very nice cozy restaurant. Location is a 10-min walk from Jurong East MRT, it's at Snow City next to Science Centre. Foods are good and reasonably priced! We ordered pastas, soups, salad, and beers. Service was good, the staff were polite, and foods were served quite fast. There is indoor and outdoor seating. We sat indoors, the ambience was great. Place is not overly crowded and good for chilling out. Will go back there again
5
The food was spectacular for the price. Best value in singapore.Beer (lager) took a while to arrive and was not great, it went flat and wasnt nice, but the food quality made it all worth while. We tried steak, risotto, pasta and chicken and all amazingly presented and delicious.Its a bit out of the way but recommended
4
This hidden microbrewery is a gift to Jurong! Though the echoes in the place would prove to amplify everyone's conversation, the drinks are interesting. Food wise, the risotto I ordered was slightly undercooked and lacked flavor. That being said, the lasagna and the desserts are fantastic. I'll definitely come back to try more of their food and of course for the beer.The staff are very attentive, polite and professional
4
Went on a Saturday night, around 8pm where there was not many people, and service was fast. Capesante scallops are delicious; the scallops were tender and the gravy was flavourful. I also enjoyed the gnocchi with tomato sauce. A tad softer than typical gnocchi, but good enough for me. I couldn't stop piling on more of the cheesy tomato sauce. However the Granchio (crabmeat with pink sauce pasta) did not suit my palate as I found the taste too "fishy".Loved the quirky jazz music, which added to the casual dining atmosphere
4
Serving is small but the food is not bad.We ordered Burrata, Zuppa di Funghi, Granchio, Pollo alla Milanese, Tiramisu. Burrata - Burata cheese with rocket salad, tomato & Parma ham. I tried the dish at AMK branch before and it was nice. So I decided to order same dish but AMK branch burrata is nicer.Zuppa do Fungi - mushroom soup with truffle oil. Very tasty.Granchio - Pasta in crabmeat sauce. Not bad if you are a pasta loverPollo alla Milanese - chicken is slightly dry but the taste is okTiramisu - Hmmm not bad but the cake is hard. When I tried in AMK, the cake is Sofy
5
Food was good , price was affordable, great ambience. Had a really great time there. Service was pretty good too. cleared our plates after our appetisers. and best thing was no 10% service charge! only charged us GST, which made the food more value for money especially when it was so yummy.
4
Tried the crabmeat in pink sauce dish and the seafood pasta in saffron sauce. Found the seafood portions to be too little? The dish only has 1 squid ring 2 clams and 1 prawn??
5
Super affordable and delicious crab meat linguine, at only $14! We had the matcha lava cake too, it was soooo flowy. But a tad too sweet for my liking. Will visit again to try other pastas!
3
Food quality is average but good value for a family dining. Venue is interesting and atmosphere is cozy.
4
Overall not bad good customer service good food and value. Atmosphere was also great. Perfect for dates or hangout just for a drink
4
2nd visit here, food was good and affordable! Had the crabmeat pasta, really very rich, recommended to share. Still love the lava cake here. Will return again!
5
Away from the crowd of shopping malls in jurong east is this nice cosy place with good food and drinks. There are both indoor and outdoor seatings and it can be a rather nice place to hang out with friends for drinks on a cool evening
2
we arrived around 7.15pm. Place was not full but the place seems understaffed because we waited at the door for 5 mins. We wanted to order, another 10 mins wait? The food is below mediocre for the portion and price. The green beer was so so, nothing to shout about. Towards the end of our dinner at about 8.30pm, asking for the bill took about 10mins even though there were more staff? Really don't understand why there was a q for a poor experience
4
Food (main course) there was great and the ambience was good. You can choose between alfresco and indoor dining. Good for catching up with friends over a leisurely meal.Waiters were friendly, but needs to be more attentive (needed to be reminded of a missed drink and a missed dessert).Tiramisu was not up to my expectations due to the high quality of our main courses. Sweetness too overpowering, we couldn't detect the expresso
3
went for valentines day dinner, reserve for 2 didn't request for any seating arrangement as we didn't know there's outdoor areas, After we arrived at the place, we wanted the to switch from indoor to outdoor table. However request was declined even though there's not many people seating outdoor. food wise take damn long to serve especially the lamb but really I recommend the lamb, very shiok
3
If you are looking for a nearby place to chill in the west, this would be it. Beer quality and price are decent, not a wide selection though but was fine for me. Staff are great and friendly, just that place always seems to be under staff. For non picky customer on service level efficiency
5
Nice restaurant with ample parking. Food is nicely presented and is cheap. Taste good too. Service is good too
4
Was a quiet and cosy evening. Unfortunately, the Xmas menu was not available yet. Overall worth a visit.
3
Food was not too bad, but the customer service was poor. They didn't attend to us when they saw us at the door as all of them were busy arranging tables. 1 could've just attended to us as it would take less than a minute? Took them quite awhile to realize that we wanted to take an order too. And when they are coming over, they take their own sweet time to walk over to our table. Waiting time for food also takes quite awhile!
4
It's my 2nd visit here. Same problems as before (orders got messed up) so I do believe they need to get their system fixed/work on their service.HOWEVER, the food is delicious & value for money. My favourite is the Vongole. Fresh, hearty food, delicious beer (my favourite is the wheat), & casual ambience. Ample parking is a bonus, too. Definitely will return
1
I went with my family of 5 for Christmas dinner.Pros: Good food, good price. Great ambience. I can say that the place looks even better than the pictures.Cons: Terrible, terrible experience.Timeline:+ Reservation was smooth. We made a reservation for 6:30pm. We arrived at 6:45pm and still got accomodated.-- While taking the time to decide what to order, waiter number 1 comes and says - "Sorry, we have a reservation coming for 7:30pm" (Then nothing). We respond, "ok so what do we do?". He says something about transferring seats then goes away. Nothing happens. I started feeling stressed. Should I hurry eating? Should I follow up my table transfer?- 4 of us decided and got to order. One of us still didn't get to decide and asked if he could hang on to the menu. Waiter number 2 says "sorry I need to take the menu because we need to serve the food already". My bro says, "but I haven't made my order yet!-- First food arrives 7:25pm. The rest arrive around 7:45pm.++ All our orders tasted great!- With our meals just done and now enjoying our home brewed beers, waiter number 3 comes and asks us to transfer table. I said "oh, it's alright can we get the bill?". We drank what remained of our beers in one gulp, got our bags, got up quick, personally went to the counter to make our payment there.--- We hear the manager (or waiter number 1) tell the next customers that the reason they had to wait was Our Fault. Because we took their table! On the way out we overhear the next customers telling their companions while pointing their fingers at us about us being the cause of their Christmas inconvenience.Summary:Even if you've never written a review before, you will. Like this

Food at Pocoloco is actually good value for money and for the price you pay, it is quite a pleasant restaurant esp if you want a quieter environment as it is not located in a big mall and just want to eat comfortably with family or friends in a casual setting. The service was good and attentive.The Burrata was good and so was the gamberi (garlic butter prawns) and generally the pasta and risottos are fine. The Chicken Milanese was rather dry i.e. the chicken fillet though the arrabiata sauce and mash potatoes were good. The tiramisu was OK and I enjoyed the lava cake better, just wished the chocolate cream was less sweet so you could actually taste dark chocolate. But Singaporeans have a sweet tooth so you do have to cater to the general population. Maybe an alternative is to keep the dark chocolate sauce unsweetened and add a caramel topping according to the customer's taste for sweetness! That way, even diabetics could enjoy that dessert!Normally I prefer red wine with Italian food but decided to try their beers. We enjoyed the beers - the light lager and the creamier/fruity wheat beer. Overall, a good neighbourhood restaurant
2
Went there with a group of friends for an afternoon beer. We were served by this tall gentleman who had little patience in taking our order. We were for a couple of seconds considering what to order for appetizers and he asked us in an impatient tone if he could come back later when we have made up our minds. Appetizers tasted pretty average and beer we ordered were not cold and tasted pretty flat. I probably will not be back here but will give the AMK branch a try as I have read better reviews about the service and food there!
4
I honestly hope that not too many people will know about Pocoloco because it is a GEM in the west. Good place to chill with friends, there's even an outdoor area if the weather is good, the food was priced reasonably, really a fantastic place for gatherings.Especially enjoyed the pasta with crabmeat. will be back to try more food!! enjoyed the lava cake that I had as well.
3
Dessert not up to standard Penna Cotta was of poor texture Recommended cheese cake was a disappointment - expected fresh berries but was given syrup soaked berries that came with the cheese cake Difficult to call for service as waiters are hardly station on the outdoor
4
The environment is pleasant and the staff are friendly. They sure know their menu very well. The brewery variety caters to seasoned drinkers as well as beginners.The desserts look very tempting. Unfortunately we were too full with our main course. Oh well.... that leaves a good excuse to return! Love the place
2
Cosy ambience with friendly service approached !! Especially when we request for a glass of seaweed beer to try and was surprised was given a sip to try the taste first for free from an polite Indian tall gentleman haha (sorry didn't noticed his name).
5
The food was great although portion can be considered small to some. The view was spectacular but do note the opening hours :)
3
We were there for a business dinner. It was not my first time and I knew the food served were very economical and had pretty awesome standards. Only the service portion was lacking. Other than that it's all good.
2
ambient was ok. we were sitting in door, maybe outdoor will be nice. food wise, average, nth fanciful. service crew ( esp a very young girl), had such a sulking face throughout.
4
Tucked at the second floor of snow city, enter snow city and look for a staircase near the snow city counter. You will be welcomed by a nice, cosy, homely environment. The staff are friendly and helpful. The salad is fresh, the steak is juicy and tender, and the dessert is nicely done.
3
The food was palatable on the whole. Pasta was standard without 'wow' factor. Molten lava cake wasn't warm but the taste was not too bad. Service staff was not very welcoming even though it was an almost empty restaurant. Food and service was definitely better at AMK branch.
4
The location is a little secluded on the second floor of Snow City but the beers at $7-$8 a glass is quite a good deal.The green beer made from seaweed barley is a must try. It is light and refreshing, suitable for people who are new to beer. The dunkel is a great choice too.We were pleasantly surprised with the food as well. The ocean trout was seasoned and cooked to perfection and the crab pasta was creamy and tasty
4
I enjoyed the appetizers (clams in white wine sauce, baked scallops) more than the main dish (crabmeat pasta in pink sauce) I ordered. Had 2 beers as well-- Verde (green beer, not my type) & Birra de Fermento (a cloudy wheat- right up my alley).The clams & scallops were so juicy & flavourful. The pasta had good flavour & great texture, but I could BARELY find any crabmeat inside. That was disappointing; but somehow, I still want to come back to try the rest of their menu. (I guess the appetizers really hit the spot?
5
Booked via Quandoo to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. We were given a tiramisu cake on the house which was delicious. Staff were friendly and attentive. We arrived at 6pm just when doors opened for dinner service, and left just before it got crowded. The food was delicious - Mushroom risotto is a must try!!! 7% & 8% lager from their brewery was smooth too
5
Heard of this restaurant online and decided to try it because the reviews were good and food looks really yummy.Love the ambience there w the music and all.My friend and I got an appetiser, a pasta and a risotto to share.We tried the Zuppa di Melone which is chilled melon soup w parma ham. Something refreshing and not what we expected.For pasta, we had Manzo which is Pasta w beef in truffle cream sauce. We could smell the truffle when it arrived. The pasta was al dente and the sauce coated it really well. Would recommend this!We had Porcini risotto and we both found the risotto a little hard. The porcini were juicy. I personally find the mushroom taste a little too overpowering and would recommened to share! My friend loves it though, recommend this dish for mushroom lovers.Overall a nice dining experience
