The rice dumpling is nicely wrapped in bamboo leaves. There is a generous amount of meat & chestnuts. The glutinous rice is fragrant and chewy.

I love my true blue Cantonese dumpling that my mom make and nothing comes close to itNowhere, not even the best restaurant makes it quite like my mom's dumpling The owner / seller at Hoo Kee is very helpful. Since they were listed in the Bib Gourmand and having read some reviews about how nice their glutinous rice texture is, I give it a go thinking it'll be different from the rest of the dumplingTurns out they're all similar. I tell you now why I like my Cantonese dumpling. I like that it's glutinous rice is white not brown, with a combi of fatty pork, yellow bean, salted egg and mushroom giving the whole dumpling a nice savoury taste The problem with MOST dumplings I buy is they're SWEET! I HATE MY DUMPLING SWEETSo the one in Hoo Kee is too sweet to my liking. The ingredients were not that generous. The meat taste was off, so sweet that it makes me want to puke :(So although it's in the Bib Gourmand, I think it's just average. I've certainly tasted better dumplings
