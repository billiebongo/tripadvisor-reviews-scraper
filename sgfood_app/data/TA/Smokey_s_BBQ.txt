Over priced food. Burger needs to buy add on like cheese which is not right. What is an American burger without cheese? Hand cut fries were soggy.
4
Casual and comfortable atmosphere. The buffalo wings and baby back pork ribs are really good too. Good experience
2
Doubtful cleanliness.
Menu so dirty it leaves black marks on your hands.
Food really not great. Quality jas tremendously gone down over the years.
4
Tasty steak, cooked according to our preferences.
Place a bit hot, good for people drinking or hanging out with friends.

Food is average and not worth the price, the service charge is a bit ridiculous considering there is no service.Would not recommend - plenty of better options in Joo Chiat. We had the baby back ribs and vege burger and the quality of the food did not match the price of the food. In addition had to pay a service charge and didnâ€™t interact with the staff as you use a tablet to order. The only time we interact was when they dropped off the food and the lengthy wait for the bill

I've been coming here for many years now (about twice a year) and each time I'm less inclined to come back. Probably due to that the menu hasn't changed and it seems less exciting as before. Food: The menu hasn't moved on with the times, some meat items are overpriced, and factory produced items like chicken nuggets and mozzarella sticks can easily be made in-house. Value: Sure, the baby back ribs are still quite tasty but $29++ for a tiny 1/2 slab with fries + coleslaw isn't convincing. Including two drinks and some starters you're easily looking at $80 per person. Service: The ordering goes through an iPad system so service is merely serving out food and not adding to the ambiance

Back loin ribs seasoned with their special dry rub and mopped homemade BBQ sauce. 6 piece Buffalo Wing is actually 3 in total, unlike most places which gives 6 full wings.However, the baby ribs are really tender and delicious. Portions are on the smaller side, not for shArin

Was invited to dinner here tonight with a local friend and his family.We ordered quite a few dishes - Pulled Pork Sliders, house salads, baby back pork ribs (not a large serve however very tasty with chips and coleslaw), smokey's classic burger, fish & chips and buffalo chicken nuggets.My friend and I both enjoyed nice cold beers.The restaurant is in a shop house, has an American feel in a traditional Chinese neighbourhood,It was my second visit and I enjoyed the ambience, friendly staff and of course - the food.Recommended
4
A 20 mins walk from Eunos MRT, a cozy place non - aircon bar cum restaurant with a good crowd and live TV soccer matches, we enjoyed the iced cold beer and baby back ribs and pull pork burger, after dinner a walk to Katong will be good after a full meal burp
4
We love coming here for their Wings Wednesdays, when buffalo wings are going for $1 each. You can order the wings either tossed in the sauce or with the sauce on the side, spicy or extra spicy. The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, great for gatherings. There's Happy Hour drinks before 7pm daily

Wonderful pork ribs, excellent quality. highly recommended to all patrons to order this dish alongside the battered fish. Well done team Smokey's!

Service staff were friendly and helpful. They gave very good service. Spilled ketchup and T and immediate attention was given and also helped by providing wet tissue for cleanup.
5
Food, service and atmosphere we enjoyed very much! If you are very hungry and thirsty, good steak and the best beer are waiting for you!

Awesome place in Singapore for American diner food, international beers, British cider and outstanding chicken wings! Extra hot buffalo me up! #blokeandababy

Food quality was good, serving size was good. Staff was friendly and service was quick.
The baby back ribs was tender and fell off the bone easily.
The Texas bacon cheeseburger was chunky and not over dry.
Nice experience

We were just back from Bali n missed naughty Nuri at Bali. So we settle for smokey babyback ribs which is more original as it should be than Singapore naughty Nuri which could be more Asian spices. Not everyone can do yummilicious ribs western style in spore.

A laid back American restaurant but i didn't expect the servers to be laid back too! We requested an outdoor table and was lead to a table that someone just left and wasn't cleaned yet. What i really can't accept is the waiter only cleaned the table that we are sitting at and didn't bother to clean the table (with crumbs and sauces) that was adjoined to our table. Good things is the baby back ribs are nice and juicy. Love the fries too. The buffalo wings are a bit dry

Everything about Smokeys makes me feel like is a small slice of Americana in Singapore. The staff is friendly and attentive, the ambiance is expected from a steak and ribs bar. The food was excellent as usual and the new ordering system, although in its infancy was working well.The only negative was the Mojito served. This really missed the mark but all the beers and the ciders were excellent.A definite recommendation. While there check the brilliant beer and wine store next to Smokeys. As a specialist place to purchase hard to get beers this is also brilliant

I have been to this place numerous times and have always enjoyed it. Its an open-to-air restaurant with some seats out next to the pavement. Its in a side lane and hence noise from traffic is not much. There is a public parking lot nearby, so that just adds to the convenience.My personal favourite dish is the baby back ribs - which are succulent and just drip off the bone. My wife loves the salmon. Tried the pulled pork sliders and they were fine. Cost of 6 adults and 2 children including 3 margaritas, came to SGD200, which I thought was quite good
4
Good food, and this would be five stars but, whereas the guy who designed the bar knew what he was doing, the people who run it don't have a clue. The bar, a very respectable long, concrete affair with a corner, is simply covered with c**p, a box of drink straws, two trays of jugs of cold water, two trays of empty glasses, some boxes of unidentifiable stuff and a Monster Energy drink fridge ruining the corner. Clearly the staff don't WANT people at the bar. The owner is apparently American - does he not notice that the staff are ruining his otherwise great bar area? Or not care perhaps... Otherwise very good, food and drink both, but falls short of greatness
5
I've been a fan of Smokey's for some time now, but last night took my by surprise. I got used to the consistency of the great food and service, so expected the same on this visit. But this time, somehow, they outdid themselves... the food was absolutely amazing. And the service is just perfect... super friendly but not too invasive. Just one small note: the coffee needs an upgrade, or a little lesson to the barista
3
I was made to wait for almost 5mins before I was attended and showed to my seat. One staff was busy with a customer settling the bill. There were 2 other staff having their meals at the bar counter. Although I appreciate that it may be their entitlement for a meal break, it was unfortunate that they did not take the initiative to help out the sole staff. This was despite that fact that they were aware that I was waiting to be attended but they still continued with their meal and appeared nonchalant. I reckoned ushering me to my seat would only take less than a minute. The quality of food was decent but I will think twice visiting again due to the lacklustre service
3
service was so slow and inefficient. my friends who reached earlier than me ask the staff for some food recommendations and the guy reply was just .... " its depending on your own preference" and silence thereafter.. Like seriously?!Food is not as good as before. =( but the fries remains good. dessert: brownie was really bad! its burnt at the bottom. you can taste the burnt brownie and its sooo awfully. Im not going back again.

Smokey's is two minutes walk from my home so I used to patronise it quite frequently. After a long absence, I decided to go there for dinner tonight. For two of us, we ordered a half slab baby back ribs, six pieces of buffalo wings, a mojito and a Belgian beer. When the ribs arrived, they were luke warm, and so were the fries. We asked the waiter why that was so, he seemed stunned and referred our question to a senior waitress. The senior waitress claimed she did not know what happened in the kitchen and she went off to confer with the kitchen staff. After what seemed like an eternity, she returned with a new plate of ribs and fries. No explanation was given whatsoever. The chicken wings were passable though a tad dry.My mojito was delivered so late I was wishing they had forgotten it, so I could eat quickly and leave. When the mojito eventually arrived, there was no taste of rum. It was simply soda water with mint leaves stuffed in it. Overall, the experience was very lacking and disappointing. I used to claim Smokey's as one of my favourite restaurants, but not anymore

Our family of three popped down on a whim for lunch at Smokey's on Sunday. It was not crowded and the food was pretty decent. We shared the mozzarella sticks, pulled pork sliders and ribeye steak. I'd strongly recommend the mozzarella sticks and pulled pork sliders. The steak was decent, however I'd go for other items based on price relative to quality. Oh and we loved the fries too! =

Located at our neighbourhood, this is a casual American BBQ place started in 2009. The portion size is huge, sauce is rich, service is casual but friendly. Setting and ambience is industrial and practical with red-checked table cloth. There's a sports bar full of all sorts of beers. An ideal place for the carnivore. You get typical chips, chili, buffalo wings, salads, steaks, ribs, grilled fish/chicken, sandwiches, burgers, ice-cream, brownie, soft drinks and float in the good old 1960s style. Two of us share a house salad, ribeye steak with a beer, that costs $40 per head. Good value for money and satisfying

Came with a group of 9, apparently too large for the liking of the staff who was clearly unhappy to see us. Waited 30 minutes to order (6 servers, all on their phones, place mostly empty), staff unfamiliar with their alcohol, had to get up to point to particular bottles. Ordered neat whisky, got served with a whole glass of ice. Asked for replacement, waiter scooped out the ice and served the watered down part back to me.Avoid at all cost
3
Was expecting a lot more but more misses than hits. Buffalo wings were over fried, too dry. The BBQ chicken leg was also overcooked, hushpuppies were also over fried until they looked a bit burnt. Ordered a grilled cheese sandwich for my kid...had to send it back. 2 cold pieces of cheese on a cold bun is definitely not my idea of a grilled cheese sandwich. Even after sending it back, the cheese sandwich came back ungrilled. I gave up. Fries were very "black" too. I suspected the oil was not changed and had been re-used many times. Thank goodness the ribs were still pretty good.

On the eve of CNY all of the Chinese restaurants are packed and most of the non-Chinese restaurants are closed. Smokey's becomes my kids' ideal refuge as it offers decent American BBQ food. The babyback ribs and beef briskets are melting into your mouth kind of tender but the spicy chicken wings are bit over fried as usual.
4
Overall smokeys is a great choice for those of you with an american style bbq itch.Their st louis ribs are quite good. They have a selection of bbq sauce (they have two spicy options that are great). The wings are actually quite good. Succulent and crispy at the same time.Great beer selection as well. Have archipelagos on tap, but you can also ask for the beer menu from next door (a craft beer shop same owner). Usually have some great beers on tap
4
Good food, good chicken wings, craft beer. Get 1 liter of beer, get 1 bottle for free. Tiger. Around 50$$ per person
1
We were very excited about trying their Thanksgiving menu... Only to be served 2 slices of Subway quality sliced Turkey for $30
Ridiculous! Will never come back... What a ripoff!!!
2
Been here a few times. Staff seem to have no comprehension of starters/mains etc . The "thanksgiving" was cold and processed that hard to forgive but ribs are usually always good here
5
If you love a good Tradition steak house with a fine selection of beers, ciders and other drinks you will enjoy it at Smokey's. Try it for yourself
3
Great atmosphere and beer on tap but food is average and so is service. So much potential to be a super cool place.
4
A nice BBQ restaurant in a rather quiet neighborhood. Staff are friendly, and the food is delivered quickly. Prices are not too high.
4
Me and my wife had smoked beef brisket and baby back ribs. Big portion and attended staffs. Waiting time was about 10 mins. Taste was ok but craft beer is not. Nice place for gathering.

This place is on my doorstep so I've been quite a bit. I like it. The venue is a bar and restaurant plus a shop for jerky, beer, whisky and cigars etc etc. They've supplied me with quite a bit of Lagavulin and Laphfroaig! The US guy who runs it is engaging, welcoming too, and worldly wise!Today I had had a long day and wanted to have some beer and eat some meat. No complication! I wanted it simple!On sitting down I'm asked if I want a drink - Yes IPA! To which I'm asked which one? Given I'm not a mind reader and don't have a photographic memory I ask for a menu.....The menu for the bar side has an IPA - no mention of the items in the shop....I'm then provided with an illegible scrawl on a really grotty bit of paper....there's no indication of abv for example and I'm looking for one with a bit of a kick. The excuse I'm given is they change the beer on a weekly basis so cannot be expected to have a menu!I'm invited to go into the shop myself and ask about the characteristics of their IPAs .....so I'm left not being entirely clear about the function of the service team.If you follow the same logic on food I can place my order directly with the chef and pick it up when he shouts "service"! Cut out the middle man and drop the price!Come on guys - if the waiter cannot be bothered to learn about what beer he sells then at least get a chalk board not a dirty bit of paper - but I don't see the big issue on creating a weekly special beer list.....So I'm confused - a great place so why get customers doing the leg work as they won't come back....

I went for the Turkey Breast with cranberry sauce and sweet potato with green beans. This was billed as a traditional meal setting. The turkey breast was ok but it did come from a turkey roast and therefore was a prepared packaged processed meat, read that as high in salt content. The sweet potato was ok but there were a total of 4, 1/4 " cubes. The beans. Well I searched and only found 2 on the plate. When it came to dessert the Apple Cobbler looked nothing like any cobbler I have ever seen. It was more of a spiced cake not a cobbler at all. If I would have know this is what I would be getting I would have ordered the Ribs!
5
Food is good and in particular the ribs are fantastic, especially the baby back ribs. Also a good selection of draft beers on tap (plus there are many many other beer options from the Outpost beer shop next door which is same ownership, so sure they will be flexible enough to let you consume drinks bought there in Smokey's). And the staff are all friendly and attentive
4
A congenial choice in terms of food&drinks. The burgers and array of finger food on hand are both plentiful and piquant!
4
Always enjoy Smokey's and the brisket. You must try it and great value. Additionally, its a big place so you never feel confined.
4
I was surprised by the layout especially when it's raining but it was all fine once the food arrived. Smokey was just delicious
4
Very casual and comfortable venue with authenic BBQ menu offering great value. Look forward to returning soon.

We arrived at 19:00 on a Saturday night, ready for the smoked BBQ. Which we did eat: a full slab baby back ribs and a 1/3 slab St Louis ribs (twice the size of normal ribs). Good quality, tender, well smoked and certainly in the Singaporean Top-3. But....Suddenly, at 19:30, all three wide screens around the bar burst into action with a roar, showing UK football league matches, making it near impossible to have a conversation. On the request to tone it down enough so that a conversation would be possible, there was a grudging compliance - the sound went from hurricane volume to storm volume. After a short while, several expats entered and got themselves seated at the bar, glued to the screens, thus indicating where the priority of this restaurant is. Several of the other guests did the wise thing: either asked for the bill or moved to a table far away from the noise violence. Things didn't improve much when the Italian Chianti we ordered arrived totally murdered: way too cold and, thus, near undrinkable. We asked to corked it up so that we can take it home and drink when it reached room temperature. The bottle of NZ Pinot we ordered next was better but also way too cold. What's the purpose of having a wine menu (and a wine storage room on the premises) if you don't know how to handle it?!Are we coming back? For the food, yes, but for the rest - definitely not. Make a choice: either become a sports bar and forget about the BBQ, or become a BBQ restaurant and forget about the sports bar. If both are deemed mutually indispensable, then change the layout of the place, and put all the sports & noise in a secluded area while the rest of the guests can enjoy their food and have a conversation. Oh, and when you're at it, get somebody on the pay list who knows the basics (or preferably more) about wine

Service here was good and staff were attentive. In fact, we had just made an online booking fifteen minutes before, and they already knew of my wife's allergy when we arrived.There is seating both inside and out, and we would recommend the latter. We had the burger and the half slab of ribs. The burger was cooked as per requested, and the extra strip of bacon ($2 plus plus) was nice. The ribs were fork tender, but the sauce was just too sweet
3
The Pit it is not, but decent enough BBQ for Singapore. Had the brisket sandwich; brisket was tender, but a bit mushy. Slaw seemed to be lacking something. French fries were probably the best part of the meal. Wife's steak was cooked well, but tasted a bit burnt from the sear. Good beer selection. Good portions and everything was reasonably priced. Staff could be a bit more attentive, called one waitress 5 times and finally gave up as I received the standard Singapore blank stare...after 5 minutes was finally able to flag someone down.

Ordered the St Louis ribs and Beef brisket with hand cut fries and hush puppies on the side. For drinks, we had beer in bottle and limeade. The drinks order was reconfirmed by the waiter after 6-8 mins and came 2-3 mins later. I can see my glass of limeade sitting at the counter a good 5 mins while waiting for the beer to be "prepared". Limeade taste as if there's a bit alcohol in it. The food was ok. Ribs meat was tender and fall off bone but the bbq sauce was nothing special. The beef brisket was similar but it doesn't taste like beef; more like pork. Hush puppies was bland but I have no comparison as I never had one before. Hand cut fries was very dark but doesn't taste burn. That is the food that I enjoyed the most. Reason I didn't question if the waiters got our orders right (the beef brisket and limeade) was because I was famished (it was 9pm and I didn't have lunch) and can't wait to leave as soon as possible. The waiters have no idea what they were doing. Since we were seated near the counter, we get to see them constantly asking each other table numbers, what food goes where, how to key in order in the systems, food being returned back cause of mix up on table number etc. And the worse was the cleanliness; or should I say dirtiness of the table. No visible dirt. The gingham plastic table cover/cloth looks old. I can accept old or tattered. But after my fiancÃ© had some sticky substance stuck to his arms, I decide to use my own wet wipes to clean the table. The used wipes are Black; absolutely black. I'm as if cleaning a table that has not been cleaned for a year! I keep looking at other tables. Some have the same tablecloth but much newer looking, some had the same old tablecloth and some had no tablecloth. So good luck on which table the patrons get. I'll never go back to that restaurant. First and the last time

I enjoy patronizing this restaurant. It provides good wholesome, honest food with healthy portions with a lot of variety. If your a drinker, there are a variety of crafted beers and ciders to meet most expectations and weird requests. I very much recommend Smokey's as I have been there at least 5 times

We ate here since 2014. We always made a big trips from Orchard to here for Baby ribs. A few days ago our group of 3 went here for dinner. We ordered ;# Frozen Margarita = none alcohol, no taste of lime and I felt like ice flavor. # Wine, Cider & Beers were a lot nicer experience. # Chips and Salsa => chips were good. The salsa was weird which no tomatoes, no chili, no coriander and etc. # Mozzarella sticks was good. # Mild chicken wings was a bit burnt and not marinade. # Extra spicy Wings looks a bit better and my friends like it. # Baby ribs => A bit disappointed for this one. The ribs wasn't marinade like before. Also it wasn't tender as before. The BBQ sauce was a little weak too. # The service was not attentive nor friendly. This changed quite a bit. No really sure we will give this place another try.
