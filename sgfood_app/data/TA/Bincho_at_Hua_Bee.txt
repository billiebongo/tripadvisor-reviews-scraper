Atmosphere and environment is very unique. Food is delicious. Just that price may be abit pricey if you're looking for a restaurant with budget.
4
The place is really interesting with good food and good ambience. We had the set lunch and it is really value for money. Service was awesome as well as they were really attentive to our needs and requests.
4
Just the place for some nostalgia! Lunch sets worth it and very tasty. Menu a paim to read though. Still worth a visit!
5
My visits here always make me leave will a full belly and the widest smile on my face. Nothing but the best quality.
4
Unique place with great food. Had the Tori and Bincho express set. Bincho express more for smaller ppl with smaller appetite.
Nice yakitori
4
We had a very cute and attentive server for our lunch. She carefully explained to us some of the items on the board we were unfamiliar with and made sure our tea was always topped up. Food was good as usual.
5
I've been to Bincho 3 times, and every meal has been enjoyable. Go for the set lunches (which are also available for Sun dinner) and you won't be disappointed.
3
Cool location tucked away in a nondescript building, with a pleasant ambiance. Service was good and helpful in educating about the menu which is somewhat exotic. Food quality is good but it is very expensive. We bought a flounder dish for 40 and then discovered it was a very small appetiser. Don’t go if you are overly hungry as it will cost you! Otherwise a nice experience
5
We visit at lunch and there are set lunch menu, many choices which made us hard to choose, we order their signature set lunch and it served with Appetizer, soup, salad and dessert. Although the price was not cheap, but it’s worth, the taste of food wow us and we like this restaurant so much. We will visit again during dinner next time
4
We had the tori zukushi set, which was filling and quite tasty, but definitely not bang for the buck or something you'd rave about. It felt like we were being hurried to finish the courses too. I was still eating my current course, and the next course was already being set in front of me. It wasn't like we arrived late either-- it was about 9pm, and the restaurant only closes at 12am.
5
The restaurant is nicely tucked inside a coffee shop and the deco is very nice. Food is excellent and tasty. We came for lunch and had the Oyaku lunch set and throughly enjoyed every morsel of food. Will definitely be back again.
5
Love the various textures and details invested in every dish - food was absolutely marvelous, thank you chef and team for your creativity and skill!
4
At lunch time, a surprise awaits you as you walk through the coffee shop front selling fish ball noodles into a restaurant behind the old doors with frames of coloured glass. The opening to the right side - a window into Bincho’s kitchen should have given away the surprise inside but few people would have actually noticed! The menu is extensive but for lunch, I’d usually go with the lunch sets with an order of chicken hearts on the side. The portions are decent but with so many dishes in a set, I have always found myself feeling a little too full after a meal here! If you have space or have people to share it with you, you can order a bowl of noodles from outside and they’d bring it in!Bincho is on chope so you might be able to get a 10% discount by buying a voucher.Really fun place to bring unsuspecting friends!
4
Came here for lunch yesterday with a friend. The location itself is part of the appeal, with the entrance hidden away behind a coffee shop and without much signage. The interior is a bit reminiscent of a bomb shelter but is well designed. It's a small place with only a few tables - we didn't have a reservation but fortunately they had space available. Food was really good and pretty decent value at $25++ for the set lunch
5
Go. Just go.On a date, we sat at the counter (chef’s table), and had an incredible 8 course omakase feast. Yes, it’s pricey, and should be saved for a special I occasion unless you’re going for a few bites + drinks.Chef Asai is friendly and introduced us to new Yakitori dishes.Highlights: chicken neck (and butt), and grilled vegetable plate.Great sake as well
2
for a dinner set that serves only a single ingredient of chicken, the price of it is not worth. the taste of each chicken item is average, no wow factor. there are better japanese restaurants that serve tasty food with a more reasonable price, so i do feel slightly short-changed.
4
First, this place is not easy to find as it is inside a new pok restaurant. Open the dividing door - not easy to figure out - and you see bar counter with the bbq grills and chefs on one side, with a few small tables opposite. There's more seating beyond a low entrance. The set was good and rather substantial. The individual dishes ranged from average to good. Rather heavy overall for me and would only indulge once in awhile.Worth a try for a change from usual Japanese fare.

Trying Bincho had been on my list for a while, so when friends were visiting town it seemed like the opportune time to check it out! WRONG.8:30 on a Saturday night, you'd think they would cater effectively for their signature ingredient, chicken, but they were out of breast and thigh. There was a chicken mince lily root dumpling for $24 - one dumpling. One! While innovative, barely two bites. Moving on to the $40 vegetable platter. I'd hardly call it a platter. More an appetizer of 3 tiny pieces of radish, mushroom, lotus root. While executed well, severely disappointing on the portion size for price. Some wings and steak later, and we were still left famished. We wondered how many more overpriced dishes we'd have to order to feel like we'd actually eaten something, so we cut our losses and stopped for pizza on the way home. Two large pizzas.Now Singapore has some amazing fine dining options, where the higher price fairly represents not only the chef's skill, but the environment, atmosphere, service, and value of ingredients. Bincho is severely lacking in all but skill. Would never go back here.
1
I live here in Singapore and I have grown accustomed to paying a premium for eating out however Bincho has taken the mantra of "charging more for less" to the next level. When we arrived we were greeted with a Hipster Rustic atmosphere which we found to be quite cool, but the novelty soon wore off as we sat, having been told that they had run out of Chicken - which, by the way, is meant to be their specialty. We further perused the menu to find high priced items across the board - immediately setting us up for high expectations of a gastronomical adventure and/or decent-sized meal portions. They delivered neither. We were so unimpressed and famished that we went to a nearby P.S Cafe for pizza on the way home. The "Hipster Rustic Hole in the Wall Cool" novelty won't last long - this establishment needs to make some swift changes

Had lunch here with a friend on a weekday and ordered one of their set lunches. It consisted of a appetiser, salad, main dish, a side dish of kaarage, small portion of soup, sliced pickles & ice cream! The chicken skin salad was divine, karaage tasty & finger lickin’ good! I had a main dish of Tsukune don - served with a raw egg yolk and some BBQ-ed vegetables, it was absolutely delicious! The service was alright, nothing outstanding but water cups were refilled within a reasonable time w/o having to ask. Servers were polite and non-intrusive which I liked. I really enjoyed the ambience most, it felt like we had the place to ourselves, being seated at the back, in front of the bar. Cosy, warm and inviting. Also a place to impress friends who’ve never been
4
always a fan of bincho, esp their lunch sets. pricing are affordable yet without comprising on quality.highly recommend the yakitori set.
5
Loved it the moment we stepped in from the back entrance! Had a few delicious cocktails before settling for dinner. Do check the place out!
5
The lunch set is value for money. My mom loves the fried chicken skin! the staff were attentive and always filled up our tea after we drank it.
5
Loved the vibe of the place, a super hidden gem in the heart of Tiong Bahru. Amazing yakitori-styled dishes and great drinks. Highly recommend but reserve ahead of time as spaces are limited!
5
Still a lovely corner in tiong bahru serving good yakitori.
Nostalgia much.
Come back again you will!
5
The food rarely disappoints.
Good selection of food as well.
Good selection of Japanese craft beers.
A returning customer for sure..
2
Bad ambience; noisy. Although service was good. Problem with menu - too far, cannot see properly....
5
A bit pricey but the food are very nice! Nice atmosphere and services are very good. Had a good time here.
4
Had the dinner set and enjoyed the food very much. The yakitori was very good and flavorful. They have a very interesting beer and cocktail selection too! Highly recommended for a chic date!
1
We ordered the Suzumushi set (++140 SGD PP), and we do not have words to describe how disappointing it was... few of the dishes was ok and most of them was ridiculously bad and not fresh. Non of the dishes was even close to justify the price.I will recommend anyone to go to this restaurant and of course I will not go there again
5
This was my 5th visit back to Bincho and while the price appears to have gone up, it is still affordable and yummy!
5
We took the counter seat which allowed us to watch what the preparing. The interaction was great. Food quality was excellent and we understood from the chef that many of the sauces and condiments are made by the chef himself.
3
Food, ambiance and service were good, but not the price tag:). Highly recommend beef tongue and make reservation prior.
4
The set meals were rather enjoyable and delicately served. the chicken broth which was quite different from a typical japanese soup was a little too fattening/oily for our liking even though it is said to contain collagen.
4
It's located in hidden place in Tiong Bahru which is heritage area in Singapore. When I say hidden, it means, it is a bit difficult to locate the restaurant but it serves unique Japanese Yakitori.I went there for lunch but it was pity they could not serve course menu which they claim only possible at dinner
2
This is the first time that i had yakitori type of food in singapore. I was told by some friends that yakitori in japan is quite value for money and its something that people eat with beer. something like bar food or finger food. but we were intrigued by how expensive the yakitori was at this restaurant. The Bincho express set ($68) was hardly filling at all. Everything in this express dinner set added up to be less satisfying than any single appertiser from elsewhere. We were expecting the yakitori patter of this set to be something like a main course. but it is actually very very small - merely a 4 x 2 cm chicken breast cut into half, 4 x 2 cm midwing cut into half and another 2 pieces of 2x2 cm of thigh meat. and these pieces of meat were merely less than 1 cm in height. Felt like one stick of typical satay split into 6 pieces and placed onto a plate. On the ala carte menu, there was this wagyu beef dish that cost $80. We were equally intrigued with the portion of this dish with that price tag. There were only about 10 thin beef slices , each of abt 4 x 1 cm. Disappointingly, the beef slices tasted just like those we can find in other nicer restaurants with less than half or even a quarter of the price. The beef slices are not something that we would wowed over. They did not have the "melt in the mouth" factor. I was still hungry after having a few ala carte dishes in addition to the express dinner set.The only consolation factor was that the staff were friendly. The ambience was ok, but not the luxurious type, which is why we were perplexed with the price from the food that tasted just average. This is not a place that we would recommend people to, and is not a place that we will go back to. perhaps only for people who just wants to try out this place
4
Went to Bincho with three other friends for a birthday celebration. Loved how they combined an old school hawker into a retro looking fusion japanese place. Service was awesome and the food was good. However, its a tad pricey for the four of us. Spent approximately $650 for 2 sets and a few other dishes to share. Kurobuta pork and the tsukune (chicken Patty) was delicious
4
Located in Tiong Bahru estate, this small little eatery gave a very underground back alley feel when we arrived. We entered from the rear and was shown to our table which seems more like a bar table. In front of us hanged the lunch venue. We selected the Wagyu Tofu Don and the Beef & Uni Don. All lunch sets come with a fried chicken skin salad, small appetiser (tomato with onions for ours), 2 pieces of chicken drumlets (curiously called kaarage, but tasted more like fried chicken with sauce), soup and a dessert. There were no surprises. The rice bowls were well executed. I will go back to try others
3
Hua Bee is an old-school styled Chinese eatery in Tiong Bahru that serves classic mee pok (flat noodles with pork and other trimmings) and coffee and toast during the day. At night, the Mee Pok stall closes and in its place, a Japanese Yakitori style Resto pops up (in the same venue). I confess, I was not too enthralled by the menu, which by my standards, was far too exotic, with items like cock's comb, chicken gizzard, chicken liver and beef tongue to name a few...It took me a while to decide on what I wanted, so I started with a frozen Soursop Margarita, which was awesome! I finally settled for the most normal sounding item on the menu - Wagyu hamburg in Japanese curry. My friends ordered 2 of their dinner sets and shared the food between the 4 of us. The hamburg steak wasn't too bad, and the sashimi was pretty fresh, but other than that, I wasn't too impressed. We decided to go elsewhere for dessert as the ones they had were far too strange - Nasu (eggplant) pudding, caviar tiramisu, etc...If you're an adventurous foodie, you'll love this place, but personally, I don't think it's worth the price (we spent a total of SGD 300). The good thing is that the menu changes constantly, so if you're lucky, you'll probably get better stuff on different occasions
4
My boyfriend and I loved the rustic atmosphere of the restaurant. The decor brought back memories of old Singapore, but it also had Japanese influence. The yakitori dishes were very good and well presented. We particularly like the beef tongue and chicken heart. We also liked another chicken part but have no idea what part that is. I knocked off one star because it was really quite expensive, especially the sashimi.
5
Very good food. Decent service. Cool atmosphere, but a pit poor acustics. Interesting selection of sake.
3
Food was average although there were some key dishes that I thought were pretty well done like the Chicken thigh. Others like the eggplant with miso ($30) was a rip off.
5
Will definitely visit Bincho again!
Food are fresh, delicious and definitely Instagram-able!
What you pay is what you get!
4
I really enjoyed how fresh the produce was and in particular the grilled chicken items. However the setting of the place is a little uncomfortable for my liking.
5
Dinner experience at Bincho is accentuated with BYO Tue and we paired our nice Dassai with good summer specials as well as other nicely presented dishes recommended by the staff. Service is warm and personal and overall experience is very good, will definitely come again :
3
Unique concept, this restaurant is located at the back of a Coffeeshop which is a novelty concept. Setting of this yakitori place is similar to those at Shinjuku. Which means, don't expect a lot of space. Food is nice although dinner can be expensive. It's more of a eat and leave concept, place not conducive for hanging out over a weekend night with friends. Would recommend to visit for the experience
4
Went there with my family. Used a Chope voucher that saved us 10% off $50 spend. Service and food were of good quality. The ambience was quaint and interesting. All my family members ate the set lunches - many choices available. Good value lunches. Will go back again.
4
My friend brought me to this great restaurant at the Tiong Bahru Estate. I like the ambience, the service and the food. I ordered the beef set - salad, chicken drumlets, yakitori beef with rice and egg served in a bowl plus the tasty chicken soup. I enjoyed the tasty set. Besides, we also ordered the chicken hearts and chicken back backsides. It was well grilled to perfection and tasted great. There is absolutely no smelly taste in the chicken backside. Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would love to come back again. It was a great dining experience
5
Absolutely highly recommended. Dining experience is guaranteed to exceed your expectation. Facility itself is quite unusual, with the entrance door situated what appears to be the rear area. Chairs and tables are smaller than usual due to the tight space inside the main dining area. We appreciated the high food quality level. From the salad to the appetizers, and the main dishes, we enjoyed all our orders of yakitori - chicken, meatball and onigiri. Condiments are also well thought of. Wasabi was prepared fresh from the stem by grating. Hence, taste and consistency are different. Even their mustard seeds, mushroom salt, matcha power and miso paste added to the fine taste of the meat. Deserving of many returns.
4
The two young female servers were friendly, efficient and attentive. I had the barachirashi don for lunch which came as a set with salad, soup and karaage chicken. It was a most satisfying meal for me. I particularly enjoyed the rice which I found to be one of the better cooked ones in Singapore. The quality of the rice also came through. I ordered the goma toufu for dessert that came with the set lunch. All the flavours in the bowl blended really well together. Really beats ordering the macha ice cream which was the other option. The restaurant was dealing with a full lunch crowd which got to the manager. He was shouting at his staff twice which marred the otherwise pleasant lunch experience
4
Food is very delicious and food plating is beautiful but bit expensive. we spent over $300 for 3 people.
For staff, almost are ok but i don't like a waitress attitude.
5
Always nice to come back to quality food and good service. I would definitely recommend Bincho to anyone!
4
Ordered ala carte as usual.
Good grilled food plus to die for waygu beef. $25 corkage fee should be waived imo if food order exceeds x amount.
5
Amazing Food at an unexpected location. Try the octopus, its incredible! expensive meal but worth every penny.
5
We had the set meal. It was filling and the food is really delicious! We were there for lunch and it was kind of crowded. Great that we made reservation via chope!
4
Unique interior located in old part of Singapore, this restaurants provides very tasty Yakidori.
Though specialized for Yakidori, their Sashimi is also very nice.
I strongly recommend this place for dating couples.
3
great for reminiscing the good old days, especially for those in the 40s and above and indeed i don't see any youngsters in the resturant. Food is good, especially for the grill but not value for money. Have the set meals but both my husband and i have to go for another round of main course somewhere before our stomach feels full.
1
This is my second time to Bincho. It's a total disappointment. They've increased the price yet the quality of food has dropped.A platter of grilled veg with just some beans, little bits of eggplant and tiny carrots cost $40!!! That's a total ripoff.4 pieces of tuna that doesn't taste fresh also cost $40!A mini bowl of chicken with rice which u can easily finish with 2 spoons cost $20!I've travelled around the world and had so much better Japanese or modern, fusion Japanese that is of way better quality, they all cost much lesser for sure!Me and my friend agreed we definitely will not return again.Definitely won't recommend anyone to waste time and money and calories
4
Had lunch with my wife. We shared the Tsukune Don and the Bara Chirashi. It wasn't cheap, particularly the latter but the sides which came as part of the set lunch made up for it. The chicken karage was extremely good and wasn't oily as I had expected it to be. It was really succulent and tasty. Service was excellent and special mention to the Filipina waitress who was pleasant, knowledgeable and efficient. Didn't get her name unfortunately. Would come again in a flash
5
Straight up brilliant. Set in an unassuming quaint little store along Tiong Bahru, this restaurant packs a huge punch (I mean this in the best possible way!). If you do head down to Bincho, please please please just pick the Omakase (let the chef decide). The selections were outstanding. In particular savoring the squid was a divine experience. I later found out that they first pressure cook it for hours before grilling the squid giving it its immaculate texture and full flavor. The Sake selection was also surprisingly delectable, especially for a non-sake drinker. We left Bincho feeling full and refreshed with such a unique experience.
5
Value for money with ample sides before main! Full and satisfied!
Great corner in tiong bahru.
Reservations recommended!
4
The bar where you entered from the back door. Serving different Japanese cocktails and beer. Nice ambience.
4
Love the ambience of the restaurant and the service provided by the servers. Food is delicious too. Will definitely return.
4
Nice cozy hideaway in Tiong Bahru. The lunch sets are worth a try and of good value. Ask for front row seats!
4
Adore the secret location, great food and wonderful atmosphere. Service is brisk and friendly as always.
5
The quality and the presentation of the food is superb and excellent
Fantastic location of Tiong Bahru
Only the issue is they have no menu but everything is written on the wall, but never mind
The food is truly authentic !!
1
Nostalgic singapore ambience I would say for a old coffee shop operating in the morning to turn into Japanese Yakitori place at night. But none of it appeal to us who are there for good dinner and drinks.Still pains us to pay for $68 Kopi kia service charge. There is no service to evaluate.To be fair the food is above average BUT hugely overpriced for the baby portion of servings. Just imagine $40 vegetable tempura comes in only 5 pieces serve in a rice bowl. 4 piece of Chicken thigh Yakitori the size of small Mahjong card cost $17.A total rip off for $150 per pax for this kind of portion leaving patrons hungry. For $150 and a bit more, you can have OMAKASE meal at most Japanese fine dining.I dont understand and believe there are still positive reviewers on such a dining place in Singapore 
2
Food was pretty good. But just nowhere near enough of it. Had the $120 set menu but had to supplement with three more yakitori courses between two to feel close to satisfied. Cocktails were ok. Overly sharp maybe. Staff wanted to go home so we were shuffled out the door (though it was late). Better options around I'm afraid.
4
Bincho is a hyper secret spot that can be accessed from a carpark behind the main road in the hip Tiong Bahru neighbourhood. In front, it’s actually a traditional Singapore coffee shop, which I am not certain if it’s part of the establishment. Through the back, in an almost hidden door is a Japanese Yakitori spot that is super small, super exclusive, super cool. Love the concept
5
This is a hard to find, reasonably priced, hole in the wall, innovative japanese yakitori place where everything looks haphazardly put together. But then they served me anglefish liver (yum!). Then chicken tail with mushroom salt and yuzu pepper. Then whole chicken liver pieces that had the consistency and texture of foie gras which comes with whole grain mustard as a taste breaker. Then the rice meals are innovative combinations that you never thought would work but do like wagyu plus uni plus egg. Even the black sesame ice cream provided just the right finish.Everything tasted really good and thankfully, the bill when it arrived did not break the bank. For the quality of the ingredients, the care and the cooking that went into each dish - this is definitely worth a visit.Warning: it's easy to miss. When you see Flock Cafe, that means you are five steps away. It's the small coffee shop looking place across the street from Flock Cafe
5
Chef is so expert knows how to entertain customers. All foods are made from the best materials by his selection. If you go there must sheet on counter to talk with him. You could find the best seasonal dishes then...
5
Great value lunch don sets complete with appetizers, soup and dessert. We ordered a variety of sets to share and all were good!
4
Case in point - a $34 dish that came with two clams. Sure they were good, but not sure if they were $17 per clan good.
3
Only the Otopus was impressive for foods.Drinks were good but garnish was too much. Most of them did not compromise the drinks.Pretty disappointed of the service. Not friendly and Most of them are not well trained of the foods and drinks.Overall, The whole experience did not worth for the price. I will only go back for the otopus
5
I love the style whereby it's totally off the norm. Entrance from the back, old shophouse concept and revamped into an authentic Japanese BBQ and fusion sort of dishes. Amazing sake offers and freshness in food. Service staffs have been constantly friendly as I have revisited few times.Loving it! Must try
4
I recommend you check out this small but very interesting restaurant. I was brought there by a friend and we had a very good lunch sat at the counter. We were able to chat with the chef about the food, the different qualities of beef, where he gets his supplies from, etc. I had a set lunch which was excellent and very good value. The menu is quite wide for a small place. Would love to try some of their cocktails next time. The place had a unique appearance but is small so you had better book.
2
The food was what I came for and I wasn't disappointed. The skewers were good and likewise the kurobuta (albeit a little salty). The Wagyu and Uni bowl was underwhelming though, as the flavors didn't meld into heaven in my mouth unlike bowls from other joints. Pricing is also higher than comparable restaurants. Better skewers and prices at kazu, and ala carte dishes are also better tasting and more affordable at izakayas like public izakaya. The wait however, was interminable. We arrived at 6.45, order taken by 7, and nothing arrived till 8.15. Worse, due to the small portions, we wanted to order more food but they didn't allow us to as they needed the table back by 8.45. Their excuse that they were fully booked didn't fly, as they were only 80% full until after 8. Poor experience over all and I won't be returning.
5
I am always in need for locations for group outings, and Kith is a premium choice. I easily made a reservation for 10 on chope, and everyone had something different to eat. I love their kith black curry chicken, and tried their mushroom soup this time around which was good too.
2
This is my second time lunching at Bincho and this time i was extremely disappointed with the main course - Wagyu Niku Tofu Don. Lacking flavour and the 5 tiny 2cm x 2cm pieces of beef is seriously pathetic. Very ridiculous portioning and an extremely disappointing dish
4
My second time here - I've visited the restaurant when they first opened - and the food is as good as I remember. It's quite a feat maintaining the quality of the food but I expect nothing less from chef Asai. We had the best seats in the house; we were seated right in front of Asai's prep counter. We opted for the $110 and $90 set meals, of which each course I can confidently say was done perfectly. Everything came together so smooth, there was not one dish that interrupted the flow of the dinner. My partner and I shared all the courses from the two sets and everything came in twos, ready for sharing. I really appreciated that. My only gripe would be that you come out smelling like barbecue and chicken grease. And the service, though amicable, can be inconsistent at times.
2
Whilst the atmosphere and staff are decent, the food is unremarkable and the portions are tiny for the price you pay. Similar could be said of the Sake, which is a decent quality but heavily marked up.
5
Initially I got attracted to check out this place was purely because of "cock's comb". However, this was my second time visiting Bincho and still, the food/service did not disappoint me. Kind of pricey but worth to go!
4
Place was really private hidden inside a hdb while inside was also cosy. Food was ok, but felt a bit too greasy
4
It was my first time at Bincho. They have very friendly staff, ambiance was very interesting as it is like resturant at night & coffee shop in the day. Food is very fresh & good, however it quite pricey considering the portion & venue.
5
Chose bincho for Christmas dinner because it was on a few blogs' lists of sekret places and I wanted a quieter dinner. The food was excellent! Try the tsukune and mentaiko wings. Had warm sake and it was great too. A little pricey so best to go for some event, e.g. birthday or anniversary.
5
Had a craving for Yakitori, but wanted to go somewhere new. We ordered a set lunch item which was available for Sunday dinner, and a couple of Yakitori dishes. The food was amazing from start to end:Our chicken skin salad was good.Chicken karaage was similar to Four Fingers soy chicken but betterBeer (IPA) was a good match with the food, served in a slim [brass?] cupYakitori was grilled just right, and seasoned well according to Chef's recommendations. They pair these with quality condiments such as freshly grated wasabi, mushroom salt, yuzu pepper.Highlight of the meal was the Kurobuta don. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth goodness!Service was good, and it seems they have paid attention to detail. Esp with the course menu item and how it was served sequentially and just in time. The restaurant is kind of like a 'hole-in-the-wall', so expect to take some time to find it. The interior is okay and quite cozy. We sat infront of the grill counter which is all-in-all a good experience and nice vibes.We spent about $100 for 2 pax. About 4 or 5 skewer dishes, 1 main course and a beer.Definitely among the best of Yakitori places. I would rate it better than Goso, and on par or better than the Public Izakaya at Icon (which is also pretty awesome)
5
Everything about this place is quirky, fun and completely exceeds expectations. From the hard to find entrance at the back of the block, to the subway-car-like bar and the kopitiam dining area, it's like a trip down the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland.I have never tasted food like this in my life. Something common-place like grilled chicken yakitori was elevated beyond anything I could imagine. I didn't know chicken could taste that good. The pork with black garlic was equally delicious, as was the crispy salmon. The sashimi came in a bowl of dry ice, giving it a magical feel - very instagram-worthy!We weren't brave enough to try some of the more adventurous offerings like gizzards, hearts and livers, but now that we know what this chef can do with food, I'm tempted to try it next time. In short, must be seen/tasted to be believed. Truly outstanding, memorable and very very special. This is a meal I will remember for a long, long time. It's pricey, but who cares? Totally worth it. You'll be talking about this food for months (years!) to come
5
Visited with a colleague who only eats seafood.. and rather than navigate our way through an extensive menu we asked the Chef for 5 dishes.He was Glad for the challenge and presented us with a carpaccio of white fish; roasted Romanesque cauliflower, And then five roasted vegetables with accompanying Asian sauces, then tempura fish and vegetables with Aji no Hone Senbei and finally slow roasted tuna fish cheeks - superb
3
Bincho is quaint - during lunch, you get to walk past customers eating their piping hot bowls of fish ball mee pok and mee kia while you make your way to the back area of the coffee shop. You'd never imagine what awaits you...the wooden doors open to a totally different vibe and now you are in an izyakaya. Bincho offers lunch sets which are not too bad. If you are tempted by the noodles out front ~ you are free to order from the outside and have your yakitori selections with mee pok and kopi peng!I recommend the chicken hearts~ it is grilled to perfection.
5
We had a comprehensive services from the staff and from the head chef from Osaka too! The place is old-skool 70-80s feel, very much like those tiny eateries we enjoyed in Osaka back alley. Location is cool but pretty inconvenient for customers without their own transport. They had a wide range of drinks for all but the they don't open till late even if you are keen to drink after dinner
3
Cool ambiance and really very good Japanese food. It's worth a visit.
Most portions are tiny, though, and prices are very high, so watch your wallet.
Also had an unpleasant interaction with the staff about gift cards.
I'd go back, but cautiously.
5
Love this little surprise... u walk into a coffee shop and alas, a little japanese restaurant inside.
Love the ambience & great food.
Great service from the staffs.
4
Heard a fair bit about this restaurant and decided to give it a try. The chicken "spare parts" were a novelty! Rich chicken soup to go with the Don. Cocktails and draft beer were good. Service staff were attentive and informative.

Quaint restaurant, reminiscent of small eateries in Tokyo, in a surprising location. The food is cooked with precision and dishes are very tasty and nicely composed. Service is prompt and efficient.
3
The atmosphere and food do not warrant the high prices. Atmosphere was ok. Food was good. But the pricing was a bit off.
4
We've been to Bincho a few times now and still love the novel hole-in-the-wall concept (my son calls it the "special place"!). My favourite yakitori don has been consistently good and service very attentive. The open kitchen with chefs at work is always a delight to watch for both the young and old! Bincho turns 3 on Sunday and we hope they stay for many more years to come

I love the fact that in the AM one uncle does breakfast and drinks, Lunch has another uncle doing noodles and then at dinner this transforms from street stall to underground Yakitori restaurant. There isn't even a sign out front and you enter from the backside.... What a fun beginning. I liked our food which was of a good standard and came promptly. Menu is written on boards that include ala carte, set menus and desserts with a few sashimi and rice options thrown in. It's not cheap but it was delivering at the price point. Lots of couples when I was there and very casual. I think the bar is more fun since I like the show. Worth a visit but I would suggest a reservation
4
Was there for a family dinner and it was my wife's birthday. Reservations were done via chope and confirmation on our reservation was done on the day who's was great. All was smooth and well. Arriving in we were greeted promptly and being a small cosy place we were told to watch the step and watch the low ceiling at certain points. All was well and dinner went on pleasantly. We brought a cake to celebrate and maybe just a note to improve on is the restaurant could have helped set up the cake rather then give us back the cake still in the plastic bag when we asked for it. Some small plates would have been nice as well after the cake was cut. This would have made the difference of being a great place and a good place.

Loved the concept of the restaurant . Casual and chic with a unpretentious ambience. Foodwise, really enjoyed the grilled chicken dishes. Not the usual style of yakitori you'll expect so it was quite refreshing. Was not too impressed with the kurobuta nor the grilled squid though. Overall, a great place for chilling with friends
3
We had the grilled salmon, gizzards, chicken, Australian wagyu and deep fried pig's ears.The grilled food is really good. Wagyu was good but not to die for. Not a big fan of the deep fried pig's ears. Average rating given as the bill was slightly higher than what we paid for at Teppei for their omakase.
5
Bincho serves terrific japanese style food, in a very old school Singapore setting. Love the chicken soup in particular
5
Lunch sets were great value and tasted great! Place was very unique as well, although seating was quite limited.
5
Great place to enjoy a wonderful Japanese dinner or lunch. Situated in the lovely area of Tiong Bahru.
For lunch there are different lunch sets available, every customers wish is listened to!
Also nice wine list.
5
This is my 2nd time to Bincho, and I had a wonderful experience again. The food is excellent, and service staff are very friendly. Would recommend going on Sunday for dinner to try their lunch sets which are really affordable.
5
Visits here are always pleasant and the food here never fails to make sure we keep coming back for more

You either walk in via the unassuming Hua Bee out front -or- the even more unassuming back door at the carpark. Once inside, the tiny place is reminiscent of the eateries in Japan. It's cool, unless you're a group then it's really hard to talk because you're sitting in a row instead of facing each other. However, if you're there just for the food, Bincho has an excellent lunch set menu- lots of choices and all seem to be good. I've been here twice with groups and we order different types of sets and taste each other's portions and I must say have never been disappointed (but never wowed either). The price point is not for people who want value for money so those who want their heaping portions of food, please stay away. This is also not somewhere the average person can afford to go for lunch frequently as the set menus range from $30-45++. But given the very limited space for patrons, it is understandable why they would need to charge this much.

Pleasingly old fashion joint for Japanese food and yakitoris. Good ambience though it's is a small eatery, essentially a clean, aircon coffee shop with mood lightings.Had the bara chirashi Sunday lunch set for dinner while my hubby had the negitoro Ikura set. Not bad but I have eaten better bara chirashi at a lower price.Spent S$91 for 2 sets
4
The place was a bit difficult to find but is full of character. You need to enter through the back door. It has a cave like industrial feel to it. We order Yakitori chicken wings, chicken livers, pork and grilled octopus, a tuna salad. All were fantastic. The salad was refreshing and scrisp. Chicken livers were a bit underdone. May be that's how they like it in Japan. We also had two grilled rice balls which were very yummy. Service was friendly and prompt. We finished off with Yuzu ice cream and tiramisu. The Yuzu ice cream was better. It was tangy and refreshing. A great way to finish off a meal. The only complaint we have are the prices which are a bit steep. Our bill came up to $266 despite not having ordered a lot and not having ordered expensive stuff. Will definitely visit again
3
nice location in an old shophouse with full marks to the interior designer for preserving the look of an old shophouse. Quite cramped inside but then you expect this in an old shophouse, all part of the ambience. the food is absolutely average, lacks soul, quantities are miniscule but then where in Singapore do you get large quantities of food in a trendy place? Sashimi and tataki preparation is average but the fish is fresh. Sumiyaki dishes are nothing to shout about. The grilled pork was inundated with garlic sauce. The idea in such places is usually that you should be drunk enough by the time the bill arrives to not know what exactly you had and how it tasted. The coup de grace was the 'vegetable grilled platter': tiny, tiny quantities of vegetables, probably less than 80g all in for S$32! and tasting terrible because the grill had not been cleaned before grilling the vegetables so they all tasted of meats and smoke. Will i go back there again? if it improves
5
On a regular stroll through the charming neighbourhood of Tiong Bahru, one would never have expected such a fresh restaurant concept nestled within the old Hua Bee Restaurant. The thin and wiry is inconspicuous but after stepping into the dim space, one begins to appreciate the industrial chic + traditional interiors. We sat the bar area, which allowed us to view the chefs' preparation of our food. The set lunch menu was pretty extensive and we chose the Yakitori Don set ($25) after finding out that the Salmon Ikura Set has ran out (Tip: Come early). The meal was fun and interesting, with a savoury Braised Squid as our appetizer. The next few dishes (included in the set, how generous) were chicken-based. We had a crisp chicken skin salad, soy-glazed chicken drumlets, collagen-rich chicken soup, crunchy pickles and a refreshing end to our meal, yuzu sorbet. All the while we were treated with free-flow green tea. The main dish, Yakidori Don, was not your usual chicken skewers but a generous slab of grilled chicken. The large slice of onion was grilled to perfection and added a tinge of sweetness to the otherwise savoury dish. The chicken was fresh and tender, with an addictive smoky taste. It seems like the dishes here, from the mains down to the sides, focus on simplicity and freshness of the ingredients. The sole ala-carte item we tried was the Mentai Wings ($15). The portion was shockingly small, merely two halves of a chicken wing stuffed with a paltry amount of mentai. Taste-wise, it was nothing spectacular, reminding us of chicken wings grilled during group gatherings.Having visited this restaurant multiple times, it seems like their food quality is consistently good, but the set lunches tend to be more value-for-money. The various appetizers are constantly on rotation and it is fun trying all the different variations of chicken. The dessert was an unexpected highlight- the yuzu sorbet was light, refreshing and tangy in the most delicious way possible. Not your run-of-the-mill, chemical-tasting ice confection. On Sundays, they serve their set lunch menu during dinner too

Menus on boards... Ordered lunch set at dinner. Reasonably priced. The mochi dessert was delicious albeit small!
5
Bincho is one of those small places that people in the know love to boast about...absolutely authentic yet so on trend. Service and food were great.
4
The food always taste good and hold its standards after many visits. Great value for the yakitori meals.
5
Love it's cooling and variety of dishes. This time I tried the Oyako Don Set which was absolutely delicious.
2
Went there with great expectations. Ordered house white wine, they ran out so we had Sake, pricey starting at $110. Portions small. Had diahorrea nite & next morning.
Lamb & minced chicken balls too rare! For $320+ we were hungry after.
1
Never step into this terrible place. U will definitely regret it. Food quality is lousy for the price tag and service sucks big time. I ordered a beef steak which came in really dry, chewy, tough and tasted like rubber. Thankfully this horrible steak came in really small miserable portion- just a couple of slices at $45. My jaws were cramped from chewing and after the second slice, I feedback to the staff. I waited, leaving the rest of the rubber slices untouched. Nothing was done. The staff just went back to his chores. I was really fed up and wanted to go to another place to fill my hungry stomach. of Coz I was made to pay for the horrible rubber steak.
2
The drinks at the beginning of the meal was lovely and unique. However our table was only ready 1 hour after the reservation time and on ordering food, that also took a long time for the food to be ready. Thus thou we had booked for 830pm, we only started dinner at 10pm. Don't think we will be back
3
This is a pretty cool hipster joint with a hidden entrance. Plenty of parking around.We went for dinner. Ordered a dinner set and some a la carte items for the two of us. Grilled stuff were ok, not great, but ok. It has a Japanese izakaya vibe which was pretty cool.Service was ok. Staff were attentive and prompt.It was all good until the bill came. It was over 300 bucks for the two of us. We left hungry. We are always willing to pay for good food, but the stuff we ate was not worth the 300 bucks at all
4
As advertised, this is a hipster joint with very decent food (we had the Shin Ryuku set, with an excellent Kurobota Maki Onigiri) but at top-end prices. For a late sitting on a Wednesday night, the place was pretty packed and happening. We had a good experience and would recommend this place to others looking for a unique dining experience for a special occasion
4
Had lunch here last Sun and sat at the bar counter where we could see all the charcoal action while the chef did his grilling.Order the bara chirashi and the sirloin don sets as well ala carte portion of the tsukune with egg yolk. The sets were value for money - came with salad, 2 pcs drumlets, pickles, soup and dessert.We loved the food (sashimi was fresh and the sirloin was nicely grilled albeit some parts were hard to bite coz of the tendons). Admittedly, the grilled items fared better
4
I had been planning to visit Bincho for some time and finally got a chance. Ordered items that I do not usually have: yakitori chicken heart, smoked tuna belly, tempura eel and Kaisen don. Everything was good to very good so will be back.
4
The fishes were very fresh and the grills were superb! However, the food portions were small.
The service provided by the waitresses were friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend people to come for special occasions.
5
Excellent food but extremely pricey too! Rather difficult to see the food menu as it's only written on the board than having provided menu.
3
I've been to Bincho a few times over the past 3 years, and it seems to me that the quality of the food has dropped considerably.
5
We have eaten here several times, both for lunch and dinner, and the food is always good. We started out with a few salt-grilled yakitori dishes to go with a dry sake (wings, tail, thigh) and those were all excellent. We decided to try the Beef Rib with momotaro tomatoes and had a small rice bowl each. The tsukune burger with egg donburi is a small serving size so one can have an additional dish to share without feeling too full. feeling too full. The wagyu beef rib was grilled perfectly but die to the cut, the last bits near the bone were a bit tough and chewy. Despite all that grilling the restaurant is never smoky and you never leave smelling like Yakitori. We love the ambiance of this noodle-place by day, hip Japanese Izakaya by night restaurant. The staff is very well trained and the waitress even remembered us from our last visit. Definitely one of our favorite go to places!
4
So this place is a little gimcky - the fact that you have to go via the back door and that it's a coffee shop during the day - but the concept does work. The food was not bad - my favourite was the ikura and uni don. The drinks menu very extensive. Good for a relaxing sunday evening but it's not cheap.
5
Places like this are rare in SG. A place where the ambiance is cool (not to be confused by the meek as new and trendy) and the food was very good. The mackerel was absolutely delicious, and I also loved the grilled vegetables. Mixology drinks were spot on. A great spot to chill with my honey.
4
Stopped in for Sunday lunch for an unexpected opening. Had a lovely set lunch and Suntory malt. Delicious food, salad with chicken skin, chicken soup, raw tuna salad, and black sesame ice cream. All was quite enjoyable. They have a long dinner menu which we will return for including a nice saki and drinks menu. The atmosphere is cozy with warm furnishings. If you like Japanese food this is worth a try
2
OK I heard the dinner sets are not value for money so I came on Sunday night, when they serve the lunch bowl set at good prices. OK. No paper menu at your table and only items written on the wall all over the place. So it's really hard for us to read carefully and choose what we want. We ordered one cocktail each and one lunch bowl set each. I was thinking the bill should be friendly. Then I asked the waiter to recommend one a la carte item to share and he recommended Tuna Cheek, which is the last three days they offer that. Okay. Without much debating, we did. It came out, quite different than I expected. Huge bones with not much meat on one piece and the other piece is super oily fatty. At the end of the bill, the tuna came out to be the most expensive item - SGD 68! More than two lunch sets combined! I have done fine dinings and paid expensive food bills all the time. However I was not so happy about this big bill because we weren't reminded of the price at ordering and the food came out not that mind blowing. Imagine you are paying big bucks for not what you prepared for and not so delicious food, you probably won't be happy with the sneaky waiter, who only recommended that one most expensive stuff on the wall!
4
Staff were helpful and friendly with assisting my family to surprise me for my birthday. Food was good and i exceptionally loved the cocktails. Will def go back for the doburi set cause its really value for money. Very hipster place but really small too, so its best to make reservation
5
Best Yakitori Don I have ever had and authentic Izakaya atmosphere at a very reasonable price. They don't pretend to be frou frou with the salted egg something served on chopping boards but serve great honest to goodness high quality food.
3
Food was above average but the service was below par. The food came too fast despite the fact that we clearly had no space for more plates. At the same time they were pretty slow in clearing plates!
2
25$ for a small tiny bowl of udon !! Even the main course is so very expensive for the kind of ambience n setting. Though Nostalgic, this is not at MBS but at a Tiong Bahru coffee shop.
5
The food was superb...we loved everything we ordered...including the craft beers. Staff was very friendly and cheerful.
The bar in the back is very cosy. Pity we didn't have time to stay longer
2
After having tried the lunch that was just so-so we decided to go for the $130++ per person dinner menu. The tiny dishes were mostly quite good but when the waitress asked if we wanted to order from the a la carte because they were bringing out the last dish we were shocked. She clearly (and correctly) expected us to order more dishes and we had to choose between paying up $30 dollar per additional tiny dish or go home and cook ourselves a proper dinner. After the additional dishes ordered were eaten we got the final dish, a wagyu beef sushi. Two pieces were delicious but the other two looked like they had been cut by a high school student on the first day of a kitchen internship. The beef was so chewy that it was inedible. When we brought this up to the waitress she said she'd pass it on to the chef, no apologies and no discount on our $400 meal for 2 people...
5
Unlisted Collection have done themselves proud once again! We were invited by some friends yesterday evening to join them at a dinner jointly hosted by Bincho and Snorre Food. The dishes were very well executed (beautifully presented, taste was balanced) by Chef Masashi. The sake pairing went perfectly with all the dishes. Every single dish was a delight! And we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. As we were only served a set menu and didn't get a chance to try the restaurant's 'usual' menu, I made reservations for next week. I'm sure Chef Masashi wont disappoint. Looking forward to it already! Another note: The cocktails are not to be missed. All very well crafted and delicious
5
Clean in taste. Modern in presentation. Unique in ambiance. Trendy in style. Chef Asai is a young and talented chef with a good tongue to pair unique tastes together. Raw materials sourced are from Japan or Europe and quality is excellent. We were there for the Norwegian Seafood Promotion and his pairing was spot on. No dish was a disappointment.
5
What a fantastic find! Great quirky interior from the guys at Unlisted, the chef here is really dedicated to his craft and the food is testament to that. Beautiful ingredients cooked in a traditional Yakitori style served with craft beers and delicately perfumed cocktails. Choose from a set menu, go a la carte and ask Emanuel to help you, he is fantastic! All round delicious experience in a fun and very cool atmosphere, loved it and it was worth every penny.Louise Hil

It's my first time to Bincho and I dropped by with colleagues. We went for the Omakase set and some sides, and though the food quality is reasonable for the price the service was really slow. They got our ala Carte orders wrong and needed repeated chasing even after they clarified the orders.However, the ambience of the place and the not-too-noisy surroundings mean that it's a great drinking place with colleagues. I'm definitely coming back for a drink, especially if it's fellow drinkers who like a nice leisurely drink
4
We had passed by the place a few times without ever noticing it - one cannot deny it is well hidden. After much hesitation, we decided that the interesting setting was worth the high prices on the menu and we were generally pleased with the quality of the items - from starter to dessert. However, despite good food, good service and unique atmosphere... It's quite expensive. $370 for 2 adults, 2 kids..
5
Reservation was arranged as requested. Service and food was excellent! Will definitely go back again.
3
Good quality food and service, but the pricing was too high and the portions too small to be a repeat experience.
4
Food was excellent. My kids were raving on the taste and quality. The ambience was very cool and interesting.
5
Always had fantastic meals here at relatively reasonable pricing. Charming ambiance, very personable chef and service staff.
5
The last time I was at Bincho the beef was very tough. We didn't go back for a while. But this time the beef was tender. It was an excellent meal.
5
A little hideout for the romantic date. The set lunch is good value and of high quality. Not crowded and good for business diacussion on a weekeday afternoon
5
A great place to dine with, a lot of items to choose from, and the price deserves the food being served. The staff are great and very hospitable. Chef Asai is all hands-on to every plate coming out from his kitchen. Highly recommended. And will definitely come back for more

Quite literally hidden away in a "closed" down pre-war coffee shop in one of the older parts of Singapore Bincho is not easy to find but worth it. You enter from the rear door and enter a deeply atmospheric saki bar which then opens out into a small intimate restaurant locate in the old coffee shop. Everything around you has barely been touched in 50 years. You probably need to know your japanese food to really max out the menu, but the waiters are in hand to help. The food is extremely tasty and beautifully presented, with the chefs just inches from you. The only reason for not giving this a 5 star is that portions were small and pricing was on the high side. That being said, this has to be one of the most fascinating, high-end, small restaurants of its kind in Singapore
4
Loved the Clark Kent-personality of this place. Mee Pok stall by day, hidden yakitori oasis at night. Great for small groups of six or less. Yakitori standard was perhaps middling (not sublime quality like Kazu or Nabantei) but the mysterious, underground vibe more than makes up for this to make our dinner a memorable one. Special tip: try the signature hotpot and yes, top up for the speciality meat balls
4
Bincho is charmingly located inside of a local noodle shop. There is nothing on the outside of the noodle shop that points to or even hints that there is little yakitori place within that serves great value lunch sets. We had the yakitori don set (grilled chicken on rice - $25) and the tsukune don set (grilled chicken patty on rice - $30). Each was a 5 course meal comprising salad, appetiser, grilled chicken drumsticks, the main course don (served with chicken soup and Japanese picked) and dessert. The portions for each course are not large but they do together constitute a satisfying and tasty meal. As with most izakayas, the restaurant is a small interior space with counter seats for 6 where you can watch the chefs grill the meats and two dine in tables that sit 2 to 4 diners. There is a bar area at the back with seats where you can also dine. Service is mostly efficient though you may have to wait a little for the main course
1
Interesting concept but at the end far not enough to food. 130$ but with the feeling not to have had diner. ... I went there 18monthsago it was fantastic but this time was just so disappointed . It is not respecting customer.
4
It has an interesting setting and the Chef at the bar was really nice. The food was nice and delicate but it was not extremely impressive and portions are small.
5
Another outstanding experience at Bincho. Shared two set menus between four people. Craft beers from Japan were again outstanding. Food is incredibly well done.
5
The location is great. The space is intimate and original.
The food is very innovative and good.
The most unusual are the various types of chicken offal (heart, neck, liver,…). Try the Cocks Combs....it's surprisingly good.
2
Excellent venue, with a great speakeasy entrance. However expensive and small portions! Better for drinks
4
You might say I am a greedy person but this restaurant though good really underwhelms. The concept is interesting as it was originally a coffee shop that serves coffee & toast as well as old school bak chor mee. To non Singaporeans this is minced meat noodles, a dish eaten almost everyday by thousands. Unlisted Collection, a local restaurant & hotel group took over the shop, retained the coffee shop & noodle stall but also added a Japanese iszakaya. This was what I ate for lunch. If I stuck with the lunch sets, this wouldn't have broken the bank. But opting for a la caret was a costly affair. I ordered the sashimi platter which although fresh was something I could have forgone since it cost SGD 78 & barely fed 2. Order the yakitori items here as this is where the chef's skill lies. Yummy Wagyu beef with wasabi butter, chicken breast with truffle, the grilled vegetable platter, yakitori skewers of soft chicken cartilage, all were good.I ended up paying more than I should but food was good & service decent. Would I go back again? Probably yes but I would relook my orders the next time.
2
When it's a hole in a wall place, you kind of expect a certain kind of warmth and coziness that comes with good hearty nourishment, at well, reasonable prices. It was the opposite - we had to be so selective about what we could have because portions were minuscule yet pricey. We resorted to sharing a 1-person fixed menu ($130!!) between 4. Guess it was even cozier than we expected! Food - nothing to write home about. Can't comment on the massive whisky selection - we didn't have any
3
Really impressive entrance through a coffeeshop converted into Bincho at dusk. Love the hidden in a wall type space. Food menu extensive with lots to choose from Izakaya style, chicken is their speciality while I wouldn't recommend the grilled fish ($40) which tasted dry and disappointing
4
It looks like a nondescript restaurant from the outside. You would never know that inside is a superb, creative chef brought specially from Japan. He is a great laugh and an excellent cook.Personally I don't go much for raw fish, but the barbecued meats were wonderful!Highly recommended
4
Very sneaky restaurant! I actually walked pass it without seeing the the sign. And then when I found it, I almost couldn't get in. In my anxiousness, I had missed the small print, that says to use the back entrance. Quite a novel idea!!!!The lighting is a little dingy and the corridor you pass thru can be a little tight. And oh, do mind your head as you head thru into the inner sanctum where the grill/work kitchen/bar is located. I love how all this adds to the atmosphere of making it quaint and cozy. Dined on 1 October, which happened to be the start of the Sake Brewing Season, so there was free flow of sake with all dinner sets ordered. Excellent!! At 8PM, the manager made a small speech, and all the diners and staff kampei-ed together. Ingredients were fresh (sets have combination of yakitori and sashimi) and the food excellent. The staff were friendly and polite. And there was no long wait time for the food. They also have a menu of yummy cocktails.In the day time, the front of the restaurant functioned as a kopitiam selling mee pok/mee kiah/kaya toast from 7AM - 3PM. But the back do have Japanese set lunches in the day time. Definitely will go back to try their set lunches
5
It is an inviting dining/drinking place, with an unique interior that makes the best of the morning Singapore coffee place feel, with the evening's Japanese dining experience. The food was delicious, sufficient and nicely presented, complemented by attentive service.
3
We had counter seats and really enjoyed the awesome good food and overall experience. Yet I found the Bincho set way too expensive (130++ per head). Though I thought I'd leave hungry actually the amount of food was satisfactory.
4
tried the wings and ayu fish from the ala carte menu which was delicious albeit small. Went for the nice hanabi set as well to fill up the tummy.
5
Each item we ate was meticulously crafted. It's possible that the lamb was the best tasting thing I have ever eaten. Will definitely be back, often!
3
Bincho's ambiance and service were terrific, and I highly recommend the mochi for dessert and the sweet chicken wings as an appetizer.
5
My first time there and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The food was authentic, the yakitori is of the kind of quality you get in Japan. Waiter made an excellent sake recommendation to go with our food. Overall, Bincho is a hidden gem and a great dining experience, something different! Be prepared to spend at least $100 per head though
4
I went to Bincho with my partner for dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant is split into a bar area, a small central dining area around the kitchen and a larger dining area in the back / front depending on which door you enter through. When we visited the bar and central dining area were pretty busy but the larger dining area where we sat was empty.An a la carte menu was available featuring assorted yakitori (breast, thigh, neck, innards etc) and a few other dishes but the main menu has 3 set options. We went for the Miyabi set with assorted appetisers, kara age, yakitori, 3 servings of chicken soup cooked in front of us, a small serving of ramen and a dessert. The food was very good and very plentiful. The chicken neck yakitori was a highlight.The bill came to $270 with 2 Japanese craft beers and 2 cocktails, Bincho is not cheap. If you just want to get a taste of the place though you can sit in the bar and order kara age with a couple of beers, they have 25% off Japanese beers during happy hour
4
It is not an easy place to find...located in retro feel Tiong Bahru housing estate. The entrance looks rather seedy but inside is a quirky, hip and reyro feel about it. The yakitori menu was exceptional, the chargoal smoked flavours were evident in the dishes. For the adventurous thete is the comb of a rooster and chicken neck meat! For the less adventurous there's sashimi. A delightful place indeed...,,,will return if I can find it again lol
3
Located in the HDB area in Tiong Bahru, in the day time, Hua Bee is a typical kopitiam that serves Bak Chor mee that apparently has been operating for over 70 years and was the source of inspiration for a little Singaporean movie called "Mee Pok Man"However, at night, the kopitiam is transformed into an upmarket Yakitore restaurant that also serves interesting drink concoctions. Entrance to this place at night is through the dingy back door. Once inside you are greeted by a rather grungy and industrial looking bar area. As you head up to the front, the kopitiam area becomes the dining area for Bincho. The set meals that we had was satisfactory but rather pricey. Not some place that I would go back to because of the price tag but its a good place you can brag about that you've been to while in Singapore
4
Would never have found this place on my own, but was with someone from the area. For lunch you enter through the unassuming noodle shop at the front.Loved the cosy well decorated space. I like sitting across from the chef and checking out what's happening in the kitchen. The food was fresh, the flavors clean and visually gorgeous. Yummy sake and good advice from the staff on menu choices made for a memorable meal.
4
Very cool place with a unique concept. A great date destination - hidden away, with an understated vibe. An authentic gastronomical journey if you love the flavours and rituals around Japanese food delivered in a very original way.
1
Really disappointed with this meal. Read other reviews that it was expensive and that was fine for us cos we don't mind paying for quality but this place just doesn't have the ability to deliver on any level. Service is really poor, so many things we ordered from the menu were not available. Zero management interaction. Could hardly understand what the service staff were saying. We spent over 500 dollars for a quick one hour meal. Would have easily spent more but we all really just wanted to get out of there. If you're looking for great Yakitori in Singapore, try Otowa at orchard plaza. It's on the 3rd floor and has a blue curtain. No signage. Best Yakitori in singapore
2
Gosh where to start! This could be such an amazing space however, they just completely miss the mark! I'm someone who has dined at many Japanese restaurants in Singapore and I was looking forward to this experience and was very disappointed. Firstly, the bar has a disgusting smell, almost urine-like, not enjoyable when you're trying to enjoy a cocktail. Second, the service was horrendous, the waitress didn't know the menu and tried to up-sell us at every stage of our ordering. I was seriously offended when my guest asked for some extra wasabi and was told it would cost an extra $1, seriously rude. The portion size was very very small with limited variety of sashimi. It was just so unimpressive. I will never recommend this restaurant and frankly they won't stay open long with poor service and horrible cuisine.
3
Its a very well decorated restaurant and the atmosphere was good. Mostly visited by couples and the restaurant could accommodate a big family guests too.We both had a set dinner - which was all about chicken cooked in different styles.I found both food and cocktails were pricey and totally unsurprising. I think only the yakitori was a bit interesting but the other dishes eg salad, rice were so ordinary (and didnt worth the money!)Ended up we paid 100SGD for a set dinner + 1 cocktail. Not worth it
3
A hidden small restaurant with different interesting choices for lunch. Some sets where, basically, the only change is the main course. Maybe a bit pricey, but experience overall was good. Food was delicious, but not surprising. My wife, who loves Japanese food, enjoyed more than me, but this is my review... She would be rating more generously than me, surely. Service was correct, but we were the only table, because we arrived a bit early. It is a nice place and I probably will repeat soon. I would like to try the set menu for dinner, what I am quite sure it could change my rating, presumably up. It's worth a try

They think they arevery cool her and the tiny place hasa good atmosphere but they should concnrate more on the food which tended to be bland,miniscule and pricey.I have had more interesting yakitori elsewhere in Singapore.It needs to raise its game in the kitchen and also get he food out quicker.It would help if order were written down not memorized as ,as we discovered,it is very easy to forget at least one item.Nearly good but not great

Our taxi driver found the address all right but the signage from the previous restaurant to occupy the site was initially disconcerting. Oh, the entrance is actually at the back. Notwithstanding the slight problem in finding the entrance the rest of the evening was a dream. The food prepared by Asai Masashi was superb. No dish was not wonderful. The ambience helped too. It probably cost a lot of money to make the place look run down. Food and service was great. If Yakitori is your thing, Bincho is your place

Bincho is a traditional Japanese restaurant serving Yakitori and some sashimi on the side. The key ingredient of the restaurant is chicken grilled on Bincho charcoal. The affable owner/chef Masashi Asai is very passionate about his job, choose a table at the counter so that you can chat with Asai san and learn more about what you are eating. This is the second time I have been to the restaurant which is tucked behind a meepok shop. Choose the set lunch and some add on from the ala cart menu to make your money worth. Will definitely come again. Can be quite pack in the evening so make your reservations early

The place is unique, an old bunker in the middle of an HDB complex, quite hard to find but quite different. Staff was nice and helpful.....and that's about it !!! food is very average and yet VERY expensive,you live the place hungry and with the feeling of being ripped off. So many nice places to choose from in Singapore, you can definitely give this one a miss

Came here the other day under the recommendation of a friend for a "Unique" dining experience and true to his word, bincho was undeniably unique....not in a good way however. Maybe the other menus are better but I tried the tasting menu under the impression it would give me a good estimate of what bincho had to offer. Essentially, what I got was raw vegetables, about 8 bite size pieces of different types of yakitori, some pickles and the worst rice don I've ever had in my life (rice with egg and chopped up naruto fishcake). With the exception of the don, the food was passable...however, with a price tag nearing a $100 per person, what bincho offers is as good a s unacceptable. In any other restaurant you would be paying maybe $50 a person at MOST. That being said, if youre ok with paying degustation level prices for what is essentially a nicely presented but relatively average yakitori dinner and are looking for some place cool to be then by all means, give bincho a try. However, if you're looking for a nice dining experience then I recommend splurging your money at a restaurant that has more going for it than just being a mee pok store by day
