This is like fast food chain - which served western and asian food. Their food are standard, so far not much complain. Do not expect high quality food, you get what you pay sometime.

Decent food.
But quality isnâ€™t great.
Their chicken Caesar salad is average.
Average taste, though greens were fresh. Order taking was efficient though.
But preparing the food took longer than usual.
Go somewhere else if you can.

Good system, place order, wait for your Number and collect food.
Excellent breakfast place, pleasant and bright ambience.

We had some spagetti with sausages ($9.8) and Hong Kong style fried noodles ($8.5). Simple and quick food. Taste was ok. Self service, but no matter. You come here for quick proper food.
I would come again.
4
Tried their pork chop meal and their half roasted chicken. Good value for money and don't expect top notch restaurant quality.
5
the food here is very cheap and tastes great. Good place for a fast and tasty meal on a budget. Absolutely would go here again!!! club sandwich was delicious!
4
Plenty varieties of choices for food. Good quality and reasonable pricing. A spacious and pleasant dining place on fast food basis. Staff are courteous, helpful and friendly, particularly the person-in-charge. This cafeteria has expanded since my last visit in September. For dessert eaters, especially cakes, you will find your favourite.

A restaurant with a fast food concept but with a focus on local and western fare instead of what is typically served as fast food restaurants. They also have an array of all-day set meals which consist of a few select main dish, soup of the day with a slice of garlic bread and a drink. If you intend to order any ala carte main dish that is offered by the set meal, it is better to simply just upgrade to a set meal since it's usually just $1-3 apart.The taste isn't extraordinary but it isn't too bad either. Their signature dish seems to be the Fish and Chips and it's quite a popular order among the locals. Since it is a fast food restaurant concept, there isn't any table service. After paying for at the cashier, you are given a queue number and you wait until it is called via a big TV screen and you collect your food. Simple

Han's is a very good value for money eatery. Not for you, if you are looking for fancy place to take a friend or looking for something special, but great if you need something quick and easy and very affordable. A bit like a food hall process :
5
Hans works like a cleanly oiled machine; you order a set meal, eggs, toast and bacon, tea, for a very reasonable price, then wait to pick up your order. The problem is that the place is packed and although everything is super efficient, clean and cheap, there is simply not enough space, not enough tables. Get a table first before you order, otherwise you may find yourself circling with a hot tea and plate in hand and nowhere to go
4
Service is alright, cant expect much from them as it is full and busy during breakfast time. But the food came quite fast. A lot of selection during breakfast time as well. Not a bad place to fill up your tummy when you are hungry.

I grew up with Hans Cafe and Cake House. I tried it recently while I was in Singapore. They serve their food and drinks fast, and you know that their standard are consistent, always delicious! Doesn't break the bank as well.
5
Great little eatery with pleasant staff great food delectable cakes & pastries with very reasonable pricing.
3
This place is usually crowded at lunch/dinner time. I love to enjoy their breakfast set in the morning when it's less crowded. Good price for two fried eggs, coffee/tea and your selection of ham/bacon etc.
4
Surprisingly delicious stir-fried noodles. Was there with friends for lunch. Saw the stir-fried noodles and other items in the menu. Ordered it without expectation, but turned out to be great.
3
Popped in for local tea at the outlet in the National Library recently. Fairly efficient service. Tea was pretty standard. No complaints.
3
You will have to order everything yourself and make payment before being served the food.
Usually not crowded except during lunch hours on weekdays.

Visited Hans Cafe located at Level 1 Velocity. Nearest MRT will be Novena Station. No WiFi. Clean restaurant that serves a varieties of local, western, chinese meals. There have a bakery too. Placed order and make payment at the cashier, thereafter await the queue number to be called. No waiter or waitress, everything is self serve.Always enjoy their sandwiches. Especially the egg and bacon or ham, it's tastefully nice with hot black tea. Their fried rice with prawn and egg is also a favourite choice. Nice food at affordable prices.Enjoyed. Can come again

Picked 3 fish n chips n coffee, tea-o, orange, followed by a chicken curry pie n Apple pie. No fork n only serve with knife. Fish n chip meal more worth it as come with drink n soup while a la carts cost more $8.90 for F&C deal yet fish is mushy than crunch n bite ; simply no bite. Mayo slap on less than palm size salad in plate which should be place on saucer preferably. Poor presentation for cafe standard; perhaps also cannot compare with western food joint at coffee shop. Price also. Nevertheless coffee's good. However, chicken curry pie too fluffy/flaky not enough filling for the price as for Apple pie it's good taste but agree with Kenny better deal at mackers. Now he suggests that prob Swenson better deal!Next visit can try their beef Hor fun 
4
Hans serves up Breakfast, Western, Cakes and Local Delights at highly affordable prices. Have your traditional cuppa in the morning complete with a good range of white/whole meal bread sandwiches, or their confectionary for tea time. Lunch or Dinner is satisfactory with their good range of local delight or western set meals. good place to try a bit of everything but manage expectations ya
5
Ive visited the cafes in Novena and Scots Road, they are both excellent, quick service, food always good, helpful and friendly staff, wonderful cakes and they have the best apple pie in the world. its popular so its crowded at lunch times. really recommended.
3
had dinner once. bit crowd inside. But good service has been provided even it's in a rush hour. Well cleaned too.
5
Very good prices and great variety. We ate here a lot during our stay. Hard to find a nice and cheap restaurant in this area of Singapore!
5
We love the breakfast sets here. Good value for money. The coffee and tea are also nice and fresh. Service is brisk and friendly. Thumbs up!!!

Self serviced eatery where customers order and pay for their food upfront and carry their ordered items to tables set out like a school canteen with hard, wooden benches. The dishes and prices are listed in a menu, but not all of the items at the display counter carry price tags. Drinks are reasonably priced. Palm sized shepherds pie did not have any price tag, was heated up upon order and costs S$6.80 (US$5) each - overpriced by Singapore's standard for a snack with a filling of frozen mixed vegetables, slices of canned button mushroom and a tiny bite of tasteless chicken. The dining area is busy, noisy and rather stuffy - a "eat and go" place to grab a quick bite or a takeaway meal/snack
3
Went for dinner at their Joo Koon outlet. There are not many for now. But they still serve the traditional Hainanese pork chop - their trademark dish-still worth trying. Of course they have others choice - local n western. The portions are more than enough for one person. Set meals are cheaper with a drink n soup of the day. Enough sitting even for groups up to 10-12 persons. If you want a local/Singaporean taste - give it a try
4
This was a surprise find, at Han's! Salty tau sar piah (with sesame seeds on the crust) in the background and a sweet tau sar piah. They are about palm sized and $1.20 each! I had the salty one. It has a flaky crust, and the bean paste within tastes nice. Didn't know they sell this. Good for an old-school snack to go with your coffee and tea in the afternoon

I boycotted Han's @Novena since 2010. I'm still remember how bad pastas was and how rude staffs were. Earlier,I was searching for food near home on TA and this one pop up. I read recently reviews and decided to give them a second chance. Today, I arrived at 17.25 hrs. Ordered set meal for Grill dory fish which came with 1 big bowl of potatoes soup, lemon ice tea and 1 slide of garlic bread. The lady who's took my orders was polite with smile. The bald gentleman was kept taking my empty dish away and wipe the table. So, the services here have a big improvement compared to 6 years ago. The fish came out very hot as same as French fries. Also on plate have small coleslaw which I quite like. The garlic bread was nicely crispy. The lemon ice tea was good not too much sugar and not weak either. The soup quite thick like it was heating for a whole day and had some little pieces of potatoes in it. In my opinion, this soup is not from can. The portions was big which I couldn't finish it. Overall it was value for money for $9.80 and also tasty. I saw table nearby order sweet & sour prawns/beef with steam rice. It looks good and smell nice. I may try that next time. Hope it stay positive.

We have been here couple of times. Han's has multiple branches in the city and we have been to jurong jem shopping mall as well as Buona Vista branches. Both are great. The gem branch is bigger only that they don't serve chicken wings here like the bv branch. Bkfast is given till 11 am. So till 11 am don't expect to get anything else except sandwiches or Bkfast sets etc. All other items on menu are available after 11 am. Tasty food and portions are filing with a good dining ambience
5
I always eat the set fish chips set while my son enjoy the black pepper chicken chop set.the homemade soup is always thick and flavourful.the fish fresh and crispy.however the fried rice is a disappointment.rice is too hard though the ingredients eg shrimps and mixed vegetables are of generous serving.one must not miss the milk tea.better then some hongkong cafe
5
Good breakfasts for Aussies!We ate here for all 3 days in Singapore.Priced fairly for Singapore comparables.Good ice coffees!
5
I literally grew up having countless meals at Hans, an all-time favourite, lovely food with a touch of home-cooked flavour, and value that you just cannot beat. Love Hans and I can have it anytime, anyday.

Reasonably priced, Quality Taste & Helpful staff is HANS CAFE' & CAKE HOUSE @ Holland Village. Airy ambience goes nucely with The Coffee!, it's a Addictive brew.For $6.80 i got 2 sunny side eggs, 5 bacon strips, 4 slices of toast & a Cup of the Addictive-Fragrantly roast. Warning! It's A One Cup that is never enough! WARNING! Yae you may want more to pair alongwith the Eastern & Western delicious delights.One Fav dish of mine is the Hainanese Pork Chops with hot steamed rice. Finale', Hit the spot! with the cakes & Pastries, then go home, and sleep in, Hooray!! HANS

We had lunch at Hans Cafe in Marina Square in August. A lot if locals were lining up to get in, so we knew straight away it would be good. One meal was fried chicken and young ginger and the other was sweet and sour prawn with steamed rice. Cost was only $8.80 each, which was a fantastic find after the first shock of eating in our hotel with all the added on taxes and services!It is on one level with no steps, so would be suitable for families with pushers.Cheap and cheerful we found it to be
4
Hans have been around for decades and I like their traditional sweet and sour pork cutlet rice. The curry chicken is not too bad as well except that it would be better if it is spicier. The price is reasonable and I will return for sure
5
Whenever I have craving for Hor fun I will go to Hans CafÃ© & Cake House. And I only go to the outlet at Marina Square. Somehow the foods in the other outlets do not taste as good. Recently I tried out their Hainanese pork chop (come with rice) and it was delicious, but I do wish they served a larger portion. A must try cafÃ© for both locals and tourists

Last leg of our holiday was room only basis staying in the Novena district where there are plenty of places to choose from for breakfast. As much as we loved the local food deep down we were hankering for good old bacon and eggs. There is no need to look further than Han's, for 6.80SGD you can have 2 eggs, 2 thick slices of bacon and 2 slices of buttered toast- bliss. The service is quick, the staff are friendly and the breakfast was delicious

I ordered my usual, the seafood hor fun in the hans cafe in park mall. It was the worst I ever ate!! There is no 'wok hei' at all! The Kway Tiao was soggy & the sauce lacked the usual oomph. Deeply disaapointing. Date of Visit: Nov 16, 13. 6.15pm. Advice: visit other branches.
5
I have eaten at Hans a lot, and i know one thing for sure...they have improved over time.Must have's are the Beef cheese burger with egg and even the chicken cheese burger with egg. For $5, its one the best tasting burgers out there with the beef/chicken pattie well seasoned and also its probably one of those complete meals also, since you get it a full egg.To top all that with a little bit of sweet, try the banana walnut muffin or even the chocolate truffle cake...yummmy to the very last bite. The muffin is packed with a lot of flavour and the chocolate truffle cake...plenty of mousse...and little bit of dark chocolate.Very good staff at hand, few meals are economical...a few over priced maybe...but all in all a very good place to enjoy the burger there. Cheers

Han's Cafe has many outlets. The Changi Budget Airport had closed, so as the Han's cafe located there.I went to Paya Lebar Trinity outlet for set lunch, the half baked chicken tasted lousy, the dinning area was very big, it was noisy during the lunch time.Went to Novena Square outlet recently, it was packed during lunch time, but the place was still cool and comfortable, the service was very fast, my food came in 5 minutes. I had beef hor fun @ $8.20, and topped up $3.00 for set, which included a drink, mushroom soup, a small piece of garlic bread and a piece of cut fruit.Quite a good place for budget meal. Very good for afternoon tea, as they serve good cakes and pastries, ambience is good and quiet during tea time
5
The heaven and earth cake is so heavenly, also the chocolate truffle cake...so yummy! I would love to go back every day just to have a piece of cake. Love it!
4
tried the beef hor fun and the hainanese pork, the best! a must try for people visiting singapore.
4
First of all.., Singapore is one of the modern country In the world, and then Hans cafe&cake house is one of fast service restaurant In Singapore.., there are Many outlet arround now..,
4
My review is not on the branch at novena square instead is about Han's @ Trinity in paya lebar. This Han's cafe is a very big place to dine in. I have been here with my friends many times and it is a good place for us to chitchat and taking our lunch. They always have different set lunch on different days, and the set lunch are very cheap, comes with soup and drinks. The food they serve are very delicious. Portion are big too. Overall it is a good place to lunch in
3
Han's serves both local and western meals for very decent prices. It's good for a quick meal, though there is a queue during lunch time (where is there not a queue during lunch time in Singapore anyway?). The beef noodles are nice. As is the super chicken burger and chips (don't worry, it's not that big). There's a section selling breads and cakes as well.

This restaurant never fails to deliver when it comes to my cravings for a satisfying rice meal, set breakfast, chicken pie and of course, kopi si and teh si. I love a local favourite, Fried Beef with Bell Pepper rice meal. It is served hot and ample which can satisfy 2 hungry tummies. It's a go-to place for comfort food. The set-breakfast is a favorite too, scrambled egg is done way good (not overly done but not raw), you have a choice of wheat or white bread, toasted or not. For me, the buttery toasted white bread perfectly matches the bacon/ham with scrambled eggs. Kopi si and Teh si here is worth your dollar as other local coffee shops serves them in smaller cups for same amount. At Century Square where I frequent, the food service is fast considering food prep/cooking comes only right after order; and even if they are packed during lunch or dinner, the food arrives just in time. It's worth the value of your dollar for a satisying & delicious food

Hans have been around for a long time in S'pore and for a good reason. They always offer Set Meals everyday for a promotion price which is quite affordable.Their food portion is quite big/decent and quality of food is consider good for its price. They have many variety of food, which are Chinese food, Congee, Western food, Sandwiches, Pasta, Vegetarian, etc.The Beef Hor Fun is a MUST TRY! You will not regret it. I think their prices has increase again. Nevertheless, their main course is quite good but I can't comment on their pastries as I rarely eat them
4
Never fails to have the Beef Hor Fun whenever I am at Hans.The beef is tender and the gravy taste wonderful. The best thing is that the Beef Hor Fun is served Hot!Their coffee is also good.Value for Money for a meal that is less than $10
5
Hans is a affordable meals for quick lunch or tea break. Their trademark dishes is Hainanese pork chop is a must try. Other dishes such as western meal and their sandwiches are good for take away. Cakes are nice ,pasta are also good. Their coffee and tea are also good

Han's first started out in the Arcade in the early 70's and was well known for budget food. Business grew into many outlets; including the one behind NTUC supermarket at Marine Parade Central. However, Han's Budget Terminal outlet is not only expensive compared to Hong Kong International Airport's Maxim's Express; but the rice & chicken portions at Hanis Express are smaller (more expensive for less portions at Hanis Express).. April 17 2012, the rice was half cooked; when I asked the counter staff for a wee bit more rice, she balked.
