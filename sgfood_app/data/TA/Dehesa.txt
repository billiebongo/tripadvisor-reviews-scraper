Food and service at dehesa never disappoints. Menu has updated since we last visited a year ago and the food is still as good as ever. Definitely a must try!
4
Ordered an amazing Spanish suckling pig which was the highlight of our meal and we will be back just for that! The atmosphere was really chill and relaxing for drinks and good tapas!
5
Very nice selection of food. Tried the cow tripe, ox cheek, ox tongue, duck heart on toast, and croquettes. Everything was 100. The ambiance has a very cozy feel. Chef's music selection is 100
4
A very different and tasty restaurant near boat quay which has a menu full of all sorts of pork items! We had the pig head and was delicious. Don't be afraid to try something different, it all looked and tasted great.
5
So impressed with this place. The food was stunning, suckling pig, burrata and beetroot and black pudding with potato puree. There was so much more on the menu I wanted to try! Having watched it all be prepared in front of us while sat at the bar, it all looked stunning. The head chef with pleasure explained to us all the dishes he prepared, and the other service was great. Intimate place with classy decor and great atmosphere. Would recommend Dehesa to anyone, just a great great restaraunt with great food
5
Dehesa is a real gem!The croquettes were probably the best croquettes I've ever eaten in my life, and the octopus was truly amazing! Staff were very attentive. Will definitely be back again Good for big groups as there aren't really separate tables for 2 people

Pro:1. Unique offerings featuring different parts of the animal. The crispy pig's head, ox cheek and crispy tripe were amazing.2. Staffs were friendly and understanding of our hyper active children. I was rather happy considering this is more of an adult-only restaurant. Cons:1. Told the waiter we are celebrating a birthday. Not a regular one but one with significant milestone. Unfortunately, all we got was a candle on our plate of "crispy pig's head". No attempt to sing or serve an extra dessert.2. Serving size quite small. Certainly the entree won't fill the tummy .3. The pig skin tagliatelle was quite oily and lacking in a key ingredient. One doesn't get the feeling of oomph from that dish.4. Expensive men
4
If you're game to try more 'exotic' parts of standard carnivorous fair then this is the place to come! From duck hearts to tripe to crispy pig's head, you'll be surprised at how delicious these often overlooked delicacies can be. The restaurant has a dark & classy feel made casual with old school rock tunes playing in the background. Service was a tad lacking in attentiveness, but the food made up for that.
5
I know its all about nose-to-tail dining for this restaurant and all the dishes are great. But you definitely have to order the Paella!!!!Its definitely the best paella I had ever had even in Spain. The flavour of the broth cooking the rice, the charred "socrates" of the pan, I could even do this without the stuff on top of the rice.Other noteworthy dishes such as duck heart, pigs head, octopus were amazing as well.Its like a movie with lots of hero characters in it, with the main Paella as the protagonist!Did i mentioned that the wine was delicious as well?Definitely my 2017 top dining experience.and i forgot the picture of the paella...
5
This was our second time back at Dehesa and it did not disappoint. We ordered the black pudding (daily special), octopus, pig’s head and prawn arroz. Each dish was wonderfully prepared and we devoured everything with relish! We especially liked the prawn arroz which was strongly flavoured with prawn stock and the pig’s head fish. Highly recommended and underrated as the restaurant was only 1/3 full at 9 pm on a Saturday evening.
5
Really nice place with good ambience. Asked for a private room and was given one. Food on the menu is pretty interesting as well. Will definitely be back for more or recommend others!
5
My husband and I loved this place. The seafood paella was amazing as was the beef tartar. I would highly recommend dining here. The ambiance is fabulous.
5
Please sit at the bar if you can. It’s joy to watch the chef and the kitchen brigade at work. Food is of excellent quality and prepared instantly while you wait. Flavors are typical Mediteranean with an Asian twist.

Reserved a table at Dehasa, and "choped" it for a wedding anniversary dinner. which i had mentioned as a remark in my reservation. However when we arrived, we were re-arranged to be seated outdoors, as a large group had apparently occupied a large part of the tables inside , which was air conditioned.. It was so very hot and humid outside that the whole dining experience was unpleasant. They could have at least informed us prior to us arriving, that we were to be seated outside. On any other day, I would have been ok about it, but it happened to be my wedding anniversary with the missus. Dissapointed
3
Food is good but we ended up ordering all the heavy dishes which made it difficult to enjoy. Service is a total disaster - no recommendations in case you went overboard or ordered the wrong mix .. leave aside the sad state of service. The place has promise if managed well ... for now .. we could have enjoyed somewhere else
5
That was our first time and it was a fanatic discover. Amazing food, all the dishes were very savory. And the fried tripes with garlic and chili were just amazing. And the Chef was very friendly. A nice restaurant to try. We will definitely go back
5
The food was fabulous as usual. Went there to celebrate a loved one birthday and she loved all the dishes. It was an awesome dinner, a great break for an otherwise super intense week for her. Chef was also very sweet to give us a tart w candle for her!
5
Dehesa really has become one of our go to restaurants. The menu is changing frequently enough that there is always something new to try, but the old favourites stick around to provide a comforting foundation. Sitting at the bar and watching the action in the kitchen is the way to go for the best experience. We eat out a lot and some of the dishes we have tried at Dehesa have been completely new to us. Others have been familiar, but always with a creative twist to make it chef JPs own. Don't be put off by the "Nose to Tail" aspect. While this was the reason we tried the restaurant in the first place, if this is not your thing there are plenty of conventional cuts of meat, seafood and some great veggie dishes, and if you aren't a hardened offal eater then this is a great place for a gentle introduction. Strongly recommended - we have been maybe 10 times or more with 2,4,8 and 10 guests and are yet to have a bad experience
5
I went with a friend and we tried out their ham croquettes, crispy potato, beef tribe, squid ink arroz and dessert was chocolate ice cream with sea salt and olive oil. The atmosphere was nice. A quaint restaurant with nice music. Nose to tail dining at it's finest
4
We had two executive set lunches. The beet root burrata is less sour than the last time I had it, gets a thumbs up. Usually we get Iberico chop in restaurants but this place serves Iberico ribs, which is another thumbs up. Softshell crab and house red can be improved.
2
Not so happy with the food. It was a bit bland and not tasty. Maybe we ordered the wrong recommended dish. Service was okay.
5
food was great. some dishes were better than others of cos and we absolutely loved the squid ink rice. service was warm yet not intrusive. highly recommended
5
4 of us sat in the private room b/c the place was a bit quiet. Super friendly chef, great food and execellent wine. Very impressive.
5
I've been to Dehesa a few times and it never disapoints. One of the best restaurants in Singapore. Great food and ambience, with delicous and different tapas and excellent main courses.
4
Well located and yet often missed, dehesa has a decent menu for those who enjoy nose to tail dining. The cured meat platter is amongst the better ones I'd in Singapore.
4
Small and nice restaurant in the heart of the town.
Excelente food, good quality and very well prepared. It results a bit pricy tough.

Pimientos de padron ($14) - green peppers was charred well but the sea salt taste is weak, I could only taste the sweetness of the pepper from the whole dish, not much seasonings were added.Nectar sherry ($50) - for 350ml if I'm not wrong. Far by the BEST sherry I have ever drank omg!! It had a sweet thick raisin aftertaste that stayed on your lips as you sip the wine. Quite sweet and not strong in alcohol taste which is good for those that prefer milder wines.Duck heart on toast ($14) - Bouncy chewy heart served on crisp thick toast that waa soaked with duck jus. Very flavorful toast and duck heart tasted like a very dense fishball, pretty yummy.Cured meat platter ($42) - enough to feed 4, came with 4 slices of bread when there were 5 of us but they gave us 4 more slices when we requested for some extra. House cured meat tasted less salty than usual ones, goes really well with the aioli sauce and the chewy soft bread with crusty sides1/4 suckling pig ($65) - a little salty but the meat was very moist, tender and juicy! One of the better ones definitely. The skin was not crispy but not a problem with the perfect roast on the meat compensating it!Seasonal greens ($22) - a waste of money I would say. Some plain normal vegetables that is sautéed quite saltily and served with an expensive price tag. Ox cheek, Oloroso glazed ($36) - served with a Spanish onion purée that was strong on the onion powder, smooth and creamy. A half bone marrow came with it. Ox cheek was extremely tender, literally melts in your mouth and the oloroso glaze just enhanced the dish making it so thick and flavorful!Soft cooked egg ($24) - the simplicity of this dish is what made it perfect! Lard topped the dish and was melted with a torch infront of us wow. The eggs are boiled perfectly, soft gooey and when mixed with the smoked mash, the rich and comforting taste makes you want to go for seconds! The chorizo that came with it was a surprise in texture making this dish a hearty one, felt like breakfast food! Octopus ($28) - Sliced very thinly and delicate, tasted soft and bouncy, not rubbery at all. Served with small chunks of potatoes and torched lard.Beets ($24) - Red luscious thinly sliced beets came with burrata cheese and walnuts. The beets were really refreshing and light, did not have that usual strong beets taste which I prefer over the normal.Chocolat - Simple signature dessert that came plated so elegantly. The chocolate mousse was thick creamy and a little fluffy, mild chocolate taste. Caramelized sugar and chocolate crumble came with it, adding a lot of texture and some sweetness to the light mousse.Gin panna cotta - Gin flavor was pretty mild but well executed in this dessert, giving out a light alcoholic sweet aftertaste. Panna cotta was rather small but quality was there, smooth creamy yet light.Tart of the day was Apple - It differ slightly from the usual apple tart, Dehesa's version had its sweetened Apple wrapped in a buttery croissant thin pastry without a crumb base. Tart was rather hard to slice, felt like it had been refrigerated for a long time even though it's the tart of the day. Taste however was pretty good, buttery and sweet.Food wise was great, delicious unique dishes that you don't find in an everyday restaurant especially the rare organ meats. Salt is heavy handed here though. Service was efficient, polite and friendly. Place can be really noisy on a crowded day, 1 private room available for booking

Dehasa was recommended by a friend and we decided to try it as a birthday celebration. We were pleasantly surprised by the interesting fusion of local ingredients and western delicacies like the shredded pig's head in breadcrumbs topped with cubes of char siew. Food is a little pricey but you will understand why when you see the portions!Very rich but very fulfilling meal. Will go back to finish trying the menu
5
Dehesa is a place which spreads out spanish atmosphere and cosyness from the beginning till the end. Entering the restaurants brings you into a new world of exciting smells, flavours and spices. Starting from the interior and via the menu, the first impression leads you automatically to the middle of a spanish town center. Authentic food and drinks, loved it! Thanks Philippe
5
Dehesa is a Spanish restaurant serving its nose to tail concept. I went in a party of 4 to celebrate on of my friend's birthday. The ambience was warm and cosy, the music in the restaurant was great and not too loud. We had a great time catching up while enjoying the wine that Chef JP recommended. We highly recommend the Beeta (beetroot and burrata), Carabineros carpaccio, Squid ink arroz and Gin Panna Cotta! The food was really delicious, and the service we excellent. We look forward to dining at Dehesa again
5
This it truly authentic and delicious Spanish foo in the heart of the CBD. There are quite a few Spanish places in town but this is the best I've found. Great wine list at reasonable prices and a super friendly chef.
4
Chef JP cooks very yummy Spanish food in Singapore. Not just nose to tail eating.
Love his corkage policy: If you bring a good bottle of wine he would approve off, he will consider waiving the corkage fee.
4
Location near China town, not big and better reserve. Service is good, good introduce for the menu though not fully understand, hehe! Foods are good, we like all tasty Spain dishes, good experience! Strong recommend!
4
Simple Menu but every single food was so good,
not twisted or mix taste , used fresh ingredients, simple tasty
worthy to try.
5
We had a wonderful evening trying may different foods. All we cooked beautifully and the evening was brilliant....we even had a lovely bottle of red wine recommended by the Chef. We will definitely go again!
5
I go to Dehesa quite a bit, but it was my first time since JP changed up his menu. There might be some new things, but the quality is still excellent. It was quite lively and the atmosphere was great. Still one of, if not, my favorite restaurants in Singapore.
5
We decided on Dehesa for a birthday celebration and we had a delightful time.We liked the ambience, which was cosy and relaxing. The decoration had its sophistication of allowing interaction of the chef and his crew interact with their guests from the open kitchen area.The food was delicious and beautifully presented; I also like their choice of plates. The six of us shared the dishes of Pimientos De Padron, Dehesa Bravas Potatoes, soft cooked eggs, Escalivada (vegetable dish), Angus Cotes De Boeuf (steak), 1/4 suckling pig, raw fish ceviche, Carabineros (prawn with rice), and two desserts of Chocolat (with olives), and Pandan (an ice cream with local favour); and we left fully satisfied. Their wine list was clever and reasonably priced.Service was prompt and friendly, and we appreciated the recommendations provided.Overall we had a lovely evening with lots of laughs, as one would associate with Spain and her food
5
Chef Jean-Philippe is a real tapas master and has NEVER failed to provide an EXCELLENT meal in the many times I have dined at his casual restaurant, making it a steadfast favourite.The menu is far from extensive and transforms every few months with daily specials posted on a hand written black board, depending on produce availability. Be advised, this has been named an "alternate cuts" eatery, which quite simply means the focus of choice remains on offal delicacies. Of course you still have an option of the more "standard" items.Personally I very much prefer having a meal of smaller "tasting" portion servings rather than the standard and more traditional set course meal or even an extract a la carte selection of starter to dessert. This in no way implies that you will leave wanting for more given the scope of choices available. As an aside, I have never made it to dessert YET.I'm not going to rant on with details of the cuisine offered, which can be sought elsewhere on the internet, but advise that this is an original conceptualization of a creative craftsman who's efforts and creativity deserve mention, and certainly recommended patronage.Bon appÃ©tit

Had dinner at Dehesa last June when we were back visiting from LA. Came back again this past Thursday evening for dinner and decided to write a review on Trip Advisor.The food is very solid Spanish cooking. Chef Jean-Philippe is a very gracious host. Started the evening with several Spanish white wines: - Gewurztraminer, light floral with dry finish, very different than most I have drank. - Sauvignon Blanc, lighter finish than most Sauvignon Blanc if you are used to New Zealand Sauvignon Blancs.- Chardonnay, never had a Spanish Chardonnay before. I think this may be un-oaked. Definitely my favorite of the evening.Appetizers:- Pimentos De Padrones: blistered peppers, very similar to Charred/Blistered Shishito peppers which is what I am most used to. 4/5- Jamon Joselito: not much I can say since the Jason speaks for itself. 5/5- Toasted bread with Aioli (not sure of the name of the dish since I do not think it was on the menu) 4/5- Toasted bread with anchovies: love this dish since anchovies on anything makes it taste better. 5/5Jason Croquettas: very good croquettes served with Aioli. 5/5- Gambas Ajillo: everyone loved this dish so much we ordered seconds. The bread served with it was good for soaking up the delicious garlicky sauce. 5/5- Octopus topped with lardo: the lardo was thinly sliced and flame torched. Very unusual dish. 4/5- Crab Paella (not on the menu): Chef JP made this for us and was delicious! Nice Socarrat (the crusty rice at the bottom of the pan) which is a good sign that this is a good paella. And it was. The crabs were cut in half which makes eating it much easier. 5/5- Pork skin tagliatelle: This was a special on the blackboard. It is pork skin that has been steamed and sliced to be like pasta and tossed with a rage to some kind. It was okay, seemed like a lot of work to make something look and have the texture of pasta. 3/5- Cotes De Bouef: the beef was nicely cooked medium and served with thick fries. By now we were so hungry after so many dishes. 4/5- radish/pear/pomegranate salad: this was our only vegetable dish. 4/5Deserts were definitely the chef's strong points. We shared 3 deserts off the menu: - Torijas/Plum/Creme Fraiche. This was French toast that was served with sliced plums and crime fraiche. 5/5- Laredo flan/ caramelized pancetta. Excellent! 5/5- Chocolat/Olive oil/Salt: This was chef JP's signature desert. 5/5Service was excellent and food nicely paced. Highly recommended Spanish restaurant in Singapore
5
Tried the Dehesa platter which was very delicious.The two types of paella however was not the popular choices between our group. The pork jowl though was amazing, the mix of each components was a smooth sophisticated taste. Would love to come back for this dish again
5
Great Chef to interact with. Staff is great , fun atmosphere. Great value, hard to find bad things to say.
5
Love Dehesa and JP. Would recommend to anyone. If you like Spanish food you need to go to Dehesa, now!
4
Food is quite good. the place is a must for Spanish dishes with pork. Staff is very warm and friendly including the French chef.
5
One of the best Spanish restaurants in Singapore. Chef was from Barrafina, London. Paella was really good, and there is exotic stuff like duck hearts on toast. Very empty during lunch time.
4
My first time at a nose to tail restaurant, and had a great experience. They have a great paella, and also a nice cosy restaurant. Chef was really friendly, came by to check on us more then once! Definitely recommend this.
5
I don't like Spanish food that much and am generally wary of the value for money eating out in SG, but Dehesa surprised me. Very fresh food, cooked fresh on the spot. Paella was perfect and Full of seafood. The roasted peppers were a gem. Nice ambience. Good wine selection. Yes, recommended.
5

5
Walking into that intimate space, the restaurant already felt special. When the food came, we savoured every bite of it. No matter it is a snack (Jamon Croquettas) or a signature dish (Pork Belly with Barley and Octopus) or paellas (we loved the food so much that we ordered the wet and dry versions), we didn't waste a morsel. At the end of our culinary experience made perfect by our friendly waitress, I realised there was 1 chef helming the open-kitchen making the magic happen right there. Then, I knew what that special feeling was when I first stepped in. The restaurant was managed from start to finish, concept to execution, kitchen to floor, with heart and soul
5
Came here the first time last year in December with a friend. I never heard of the place, but as soon as I sat down I knew it would be good, the Chef (Philippe Patruno) prepares all the food by himself (he has an apprentice with him) in front of you. The restaurant is specialised in offal meats. It's a must go place if you're in Singapore
5
Group of seven. We had ham croquettes, the assortment of cold cuts, burrata with cherry tomatoes and fennel, pork ribs, pork belly, skid ink paella. A few beers and drinks. Everything was bursting with flavour, generous portions and very reasonable prices. Staff were friendly and helpful, good advice. Beautiful setting. Great ambience. Going back very soon. Booking in advance a must
5
The food at dehesa constantly surprises with mouth watering interpretations of offal. The Lardo with Candied Walnuts and Chilli is a must have dish. Be sure to sit at the bar to watch all the action happening to put the lovely plates together
5
Been here twice now, and the food has yet to disappoint. Great breads. Atmosphere was good, staff were attentive and friendly.
4
Great food, great service! Food was served pretty fast and it tasted pretry good. The wine I had from the Rioja region was very nice.
5
With a couple of foodie friends, we headed out to try the ‘nose to tail’ experience at Dehesa, since I had heard about it from a couple of my colleagues! Some of the group decided to go all out and try some of the specialties, like the duck hearts on toast and the Iberico jowl with celeriac and granny smith apple. I wasn’t exactly the same adventurous mode, so I stuck with the Arroz de Marisco, a nice seafood dish, and shared a very nice steak with one of our group. What we really liked is that the Chef - JP - was very present, introducing the dishes and sharing some stories, which made the meal even more memorable. Definitely one of the more interesting dinners I’ve had recently, I would recommend it to any foodie who enjoys meat
5
Awesome tapas and generous servings. Food is on the fatty side but always tasty.I have tried the pan con tomate, paella, dehesa cold cut platter, suckling pig, octopus, pig head and some other dishes prepared by the chef. All are fantastic. A good place to go with good selection of wine and affordable compare to the quality of food
5
The paella and pig's head are to die for! It's not an actual head, but the meat off it baked into something that resembled a cake of meat with a beautiful crust. The paella had probably the best seafood I ever had. It was so fresh and tasty with beautiful texture. Eating paella can of course be messy but it was so worth it. We had early dinner and for much of the time almost had the restaurant to ourselves. The staff was very professional and friendly. You can see them cook right next to you. The wines we tried were interesting, not your typical "house wine". Overall, we had 5 different portions and everything was superb
5
Delicious tapas! Thought they're technically referred to as "small plates", Dehesa is generous with the servings. Definitely better value as compared to other restaurants in the same genre. Food is tasty, big bold flavors. Chef JP is friendly, serving us plates himself and is happy to interact with guests. It's my fifth time there, I always try to bring different groups of friends to try out. Great experience.
5
I was just here last night after flying in from Saigon. The five of us thought this is tapas kind of small plates. We were very hungry so we ordered a lots of food. Then as it turned out these are really huge American portions. We had the whole salt baked fish, huge and tender. The beef, we took it home. Great wine list we drank two different bottles. Service was kind and personal. This is in a building call the OFFSHORE easy to find. Great place to eat in Singapore.
5
Tasty, creative food. Cosy atmosphere and friendly staff.We had the croquettes, olives, pimentos de padron, tomato salad, cold meat platter and the suckling pig. My favorite was the croquettes, pig and pimentos (crunchy toasted bread topped with a fresh tomato tapenade). But it was all delicious. This is as good as any Spanish we've had in Singapore but without the hefty price tag, queues and attitude. We had all of the above and TWO bottles of wine and our bill was about $100 per person, we were a group of three. Not bad for Singapore.While it's located a bit on its own, it's close enough to nightlife. You can have dinner here, avoid the terrible food at Clarke Quay or Boat Quay, and walk there afterwards.Highly recommended
5
We ordered the dehesa platter, duck hearts, octopus, paella, suckling pig, crispy pig head. Each dish was perfectly created and prepared. All seafood was cooked to perfection, especially the octopus. We especially enjoyed the suckling pig and paella. Chef JP even made a smaller serving of sweetbread (complimentary) for us as we ordered too much food. In short, too much choices of awesome spanish food all at reasonable price. Highly recommended! We want to thank chef JP for this wonderful meal
5
Short selection of really interesting dishes made by the Spanish chef!
Dessert - chocolate with salt - extremely recommended!
Very homy yet modern atmosphere.
Good selection of Spanish wines.
Everything is made with attention and an idea.
5
for me one of the best restaurant in Singapore: food, service, ambiance you have everything in one place! Have a try and speak about
5
Lovely experience, excellent cooking and selection of menu. Paella and octopus not to be missed. The chef is extremely friendly and accomodating. we had a vegetarian guest with us and he made special customised dishes and made her very comfortable
4
Basically a Tapas selection using traditional ingredients fusing Spanish fare with an Asian tinge. It's simple, casual and fun place for the after work crowd to get together with some buds for drinks and bites.
5
Found this new Spanish place through Restaurant Week Spore and had their Taster Teaser Restaurant Week Menu. Unique tasty generous 5 course plate sharings - see the 5 photos of cold cut platter, foie gras parfait, golden snapper ceviche, braise short rib angus beef, dessert Lardo flan caramelised bacon. Had a wonderful dinner in a very cosy setting. Heard that their paella is award winning too so we'll bring the family.
5
Our party of 4 had a great time on Saturday night for dinner. The food is really delicious and the restaurant is good value for money. As Australians from Melbourne living in Singapore we often feel that dining out here is so overpriced, but we left Dehesa very happy and satisfoed. Try the Octopus with lardo - amazing! But everything was really good and we tried a lot of dishes including the delicious sweetbreads. It's a fun set up so that you can see the chef working behind the bar and make your way through the menu trying various things. We washed it all down with a few bottles of wine that were reasonably priced. Great place for a date or meal with friends. Highly recommended.
5
Four of us grazed through duck hearts on toast, octopus with lardo melting on it, sweetbreads (divine), ox tongue and the hot pig head terrine. Oh, and an excellent pomegranate and pear salad to ease the guilt. It was all excellent and the not-badly-priced-for-Singapore Rioja was the perfect match. The chef was super friendly but not overbearing and we were really pleasantly surprised when we go the bill given that we were pretty stuffed and fairly jolly.For me, this is a rare find in Singapore as it is very good casual dining with casual dining (i.e. not fine dining) prices.It was a bit quiet for Saturday night which, with Singapore's notoriously tough environment for any restaurant trying to do something different at good prices, worries me as this is a great little place.We will be back
5
5 of us went to this restaurant and had a wonderful dining experience.We ordered 8 items to share: 2 'greens' 5 appetisers and 2 mains and 2 desserts plus a bottle of Spanish wine.There was more than enough to eat and we only wished we had more room to try other dishes. Our favourites were a radish and pear salad with truffle oil, octopus on a bed of mashed potato topped with slivers of pork lard and torched before serving and the short beef ribs.The sauces and textures of each dish gave us contrasting flavours and the robust wine complemented a memorable eating experience. At a little over $60 a head it was great value for money
5
I LOVE this restaurant. The paella was the best I've had in SG so far. It was flavourful, a tinge of spiciness, the shrimps were huge, the lala was a perfect addition to the dish. Loved it! We also had crispy pork head with egg yolk and capers. To those who are squeamish, fear not, it does not resemble a pig's head. The egg yolk, mashed potato and fatty bits and meat literally melts in your mouth. We also had octopus for appetiser. It came with bacon on top and the melted lard was a fragrant addition to the perfectly done octopus. Though I still prefer octopus from Ola Cocina Del Mar, I'd still give the dish 4 out of 5! I'm definitely going back, with a bigger party!
5
A rare gem in the Singapore dining scene - Dehesa offers Spanish dishes made from unusual pork cuts (e.g. Pig head etc) and offal, all excellently cooked. They do also offer the more usual dishes like seafood paella for those who are less adventurous.But do visit this place for a culinary adventure. We ordered mostly from the Chef's Specials list - the Cold Meat Platter, the Crispy Pig's head, Crispy Tripe and Frit Mallorquin are Excellent.Talk to the chef and ask him for a wine recommendation to go with the food you've ordered. His recommendation for us was spot-on. We can't wait to visit this place again :-
4
Nice one lace for lunch.. Food and services are nice too... Recommended to anyone who are around to try....
Will come back again.
4
Dehesa is a great place for a quiet lunch and for a business meeting. Staff were most helpful, discrete and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks. Food was most enjoyable, if a little pricey, but ideal for a lunchtime.
5
Food was really good, wanted to try everything but limited by stomach space :( The dishes are unique and will be hard to find elsewhere in Singapore. Must try: the duck hearts on toast and ox tongue. Will definitely go back!
5
Best dishes - the chocolat dessert with sea salt, the fried tripe, and the sweetbreads! will certainly go back with friends
5
a great experience for the curious adventurous foodie. everything on the menu is painstakingly handcrafted and beautifully prepared.
4
There were simply too much choices on the menu, with too little stomach space for everything! Being an adventurous person, items such as the ox tongue, pig's head, lardo etc looks interesting. I had the Dehesa platter which consisted of various types of pig parts such as the pig's shoulder, pig's brain and so on. Paired with the toasted bread, I enjoyed every bits and morsels of it! The fried pig's tripe was divine with its crispiness and spices with a slight spicy kick. Service was nice and friendly. Overall, a good experience
5
We were taken here by locals. The food is Spanish with a twist. We had crispy tripe, duck hearts- there are several offal dishes. Normally I would not eat offal, but our friends are gourmets and ordered for us and these dishes were highly recommended. Because we had six people, we were also able to have the golden snapper baked in a salt crust- succulent. The menu is large and varied
4
the food and wine were just amazing (crispy tripe, freshly shaved jamón, and heavenly ox tongues)with so many good eats to choose from, i will definitely be back to try them all! and hopefully they'll be just as tasty in my head as the next time i'm there 
5
just moved to singapore.still discovering the restaurant scene.and find a jem.really enjpyed the laid back attitude and the sublime food.so much more than nose to tail.the arroz negro was so good,the big red prawns juicy and full of flavour.all we taste was great.thank you bibikgourmand for the recomandation.will certainly visit other blog entry from the website
5
we stumble upon that place,by chance,just walking by.and we were so lucky .small cool open bar kitchen,great staff who knows their stuff.surprising food,octopus,clams,kong kong (sea snail) all great.but the signature pig head was incredible,sweet tender meat,with rich smoked mash....drooling just to write about itone more thing,they have negroni in oak barrel,pre mix.and it was one of better one i try lately try this place such fresh and non pretentious we loved it
