Nice twist on the food. Small plates were good as were the big plates. However we thoroughly enjoyed dessert. They were all amazing!!
4
Selection of food is unique and tasteful. Ambience is very retro yet trendy..nice atmosphere and environment to chill with friends.
5
Once we discovered Ding Dong, we go back practically every week! Great vibes, staff and food! Highly recommended
5
Ding Dong may be a bit noisy but the food and service are worth the extra effort of straining to hear your company. Terrific food. A mix of refined and gutsy. Fabulous night, Will make it a date with good friends to have a meal when a little extra is required. Balance between casual surrounds and attention to quality, creativity and presentation
1
Food is not value for money. Pork chop was tough and dry. Tempura was so salty. The alcohol was overpriced and just tasted sweet. Mainly customers r caucasians. Decor is not bad. But definitely no worth the visi
2
I went there with my bf, they ran out of the liquor that he wanted to order, he asked for another one...which was also not available. The food were a bit on the saltier side. The restaurant was not busy, but the waiters were happy chatting among themselves and not very into serving their clients. Overall, it was disappointing
5
Visiting Singapore en route to Indonesia, we decided to give Ding Dong a go having seen a Lonely Planet recommendation and reviews on TripAdvisor. Very glad we did.A lively Southeast Asian style, modern yet a full of flavour menu. Retro style as mentioned by others. We started with a couple of cocktails, one based on gin, yuzu and ginger, it was zingy and delicious. We decided to try the tasting menu (S$80 pp) and took the chefs recommendations which included miso salmon, duck dumpling in consomm√©, tuna loin, pork char sui with pineapple salsa, wagyu beef with charred shallot and a chocolate dessert with many varieties of chocolate. All were faultlessly cooked and well presented.The service was friendly, efficient yet not overly invasive and timing between courses was excellent. 2 cocktails, 6 course tasting menu for two, large bottle of water, service, tax. Sng$270 (~¬£150). Whilst Singapore clearly has many places to eat...I‚Äôd definitely go back.
4
Atmosphere is perfect for the style & decor of the restaurant. Casual dinners with friends makes this a good choice. Staff are friendly & attentive. Only reason I gave 4 stars is on my last 2 visits my choice of desserts were not available but goes to show how popular they are- sad for me though
5
Ding Dong is one of the standout dining experiences I have had in ages. The food is fantastic and definitely the best I have had in Singapore so far. An interesting range of exotic cocktails are on offer, there is a good selection of wines, and wonderful service. Couldn‚Äôt fault it (and I am fussy). Will be going back for sure. A must visit
3
expensive food. the taste was good. location was easy to find. decor was very nice. the ambience is not too bad for a catch up with friends. however it got really noisy towards the later part of the night. the cocktails wasnt good for the pirce paid.
4
If you are looking for Asian Fusion, you may perfectly visit Ding-Dong
Good vibes in this place with nice decoration, friendly service, good food and good beer
Prices are reasonable and several dishes you may share
4
Deco is very entertaining, a bit sad though that they kept the ceiling as bare ‚Äúindustrial chic‚Äù, when everything else was so well matching.
Unique food choices including some very nice desserts.
4
Ordered the char siu and tom yam lobster tail. Both are great üëç esp the tom yam gravy that blended well with the sriracha chilli
5
Just what we wanted, food that is subtle but yet simple, nice vibes and decor but not pretentious, various influences but not "fusion", we really liked this place. And the Chablis wasn't cheap but worth every cent.
5
For anyone who lives in Melbourne this is Singapore‚Äôs answer to Chin Chin‚Äôs. Cool & relaxed vibes, great tunes playing, efficient & friendly staff but most importantly delicious food. Sitting outside on Amoy St was good for people watching too
4
All the movie posters on the walls create a very nice atmosphere.
Food is good as well but music was playing too loud (we had to shout to hear each other)
5
One of the best dining place in Singapore in my opinion. A very friendly staff will introduce you. Plates are original and you could taste very different things.
2
Atmosphere is good. But food quality really poor. Offering sharing plates with 3 pieces on it, is not practical for a restaurant where most of the tables are serving 4. And the food was just not tasty.
5
We ate here about a year ago and have been meaning to return as we enjoyed it so much. Went last night and we were not disappointed! We had the red snapper with green curry and clams and the pork collar with pineapple, followed by the coconut desert (a modern take of chendol). The food was beautifully presented and the flavours divine, with the pork, literally, melting in your mouth. My husband is not a dessert eater and normally has a token mouthful, but he loved this dessert as it was so light and full of suprise flavours. The staff were lovely, smiling and friendly. We won't leave it so long next time to return
5
We were a couple, sharing.Portions were excellent (despite a suggestion from a friend otherwise).Our server was really helpful and honest in terms of the number of portions we needed for a balanced meal.Starter was naturally smallTwo mains were just rightAnd finished with a shared desertCouple glasses of very nice win
4
Had 4 mains which were amazing - Snapper Green Curry, Lobster Tom Yam, Tuna Loin and Char Siew. Atmosphere was also cosy and comfy, albeit we had a time limit because they needed the table back.
5
Delicate, tasty, delicious and the team is just great!!! A new way to discover fusion kitchen... Do not miss this address in Singapore!!!
4
This was my second visit to Ding Dong and we were very glad to have chosen this place again for a cosy gathering with friends. Food was good, though prices were on the high side, and service was prompt. We will be back in future.
5
Their web site says "...Well-loved for its playful and eclectic take on traditional Asian cuisine..."
My favourite - scotch eggs made with quails eggs and Asian spices. The food was amazing, the service terrific. Great for business or pleasure. Highly recommend.
4
Second time I have been here and does not dissappoint
Great food- love the sharing plates - good service and all for a reasonable price for Singapore
Highly recommended
5
I had a friend visit from overseas and thought we‚Äôd check out this place for lunch, glad we did! The lunch set menu was amazing!! The quality of the food and friendly service was mind blowing. The food was so good we decided to try a dessert which was creative and delicious! I‚Äôll be back again to try the dinner menu.
3
The decor was great - so exciting and interesting. Food presentation was amazing too, a piece of art for every dish. Only thing was the portions were pretty small and did not fill us up even though we ordered 6 mains, 2 rendang brisket sets and 2 dessert.
3
Service was good, friendly staff and nice atmosphere. The food however was very small portions a little too small for the price. Had to send the wagyu back thinking it was overcooked and tough to be replaced by slightly more rare version but still tough. Wagyu for me should be much much softer and succulent. Expensive night and not totally ful
5
Lively little place on Amoy street...one of my favorites in Singapore. Food is creative and delicious, applying high level technique to Asian classics...always hard to choose, but I really like the cole slaw, killer vietnamese scotch eggs, ribs, tuna, waygu sirloin, all superb! Cocktails, old school tunes and great service. Don't miss it!
5
Found this gem on one of the Singapore travel guides and must say it was excellent! It's in the Ann Siang Hill area which has such charm and the restaurant itself has a cool vibe. We had the shrimp tempura and curry red snapper - all super delicious! Like any Singapore restaurant be prepared to spend some food money - but it's well worth it.
4
Great food but a bit slow service, no one checked if we wanted fresh drinks or if we were enjoying our lunch! But I will return.
4
Food was fantastic as usual, just that the lobster dish was slightly saltier than when I had it during my previous visits. Restaurant may want to consider expanding or rotating the menu as the choices are quite limited.
4
Great flavours and well structure plates. Attentive friendly service in great casual atmosphere. Will return again soon!
5
Fabulous time - food, service, set-up & music all great - highly recommend!
Good for friends, couples and date nights!
4
The ambiance is veri '60s. A bit loud inside but we simply asked for a table outside. The cocktails were the first surprise: black and gold (bourbon and honey) was delicious, it just went down too fast.. As a starter we got the scallop chemise and the salmon, bot very good, portions not huge. As main, the wagyu sirloin was bit difficult to eat with no knife (...) but juicy and tender. And the tuna delicious. Service bit slow but simply cause we were sitting outside I feel
5
This was really a positive surprise to us - even better than expected! Both mains and desserts were a delight, combining tastes and textures in an usual way while keeping a distinctive southeast Asian style. Prices are definitely okay for what you get. We hope to return soon
4
All we ordered was delicious, service was excellent too. It's just that every dish come with tiny bit of rice. Perhaps, just serve a big bowl of refillable rice for the table
5
Living in Singapore we are not short of dining choices, but I keep going back to Ding Dong again and again.If friends want to gather, or people are visiting, it is a fun, delicious and brilliant option that combines the spice and flavours of south east Asia - with 80's music and brilliant cocktails.The Chef Ryan Clift (of Tippling Club fame) also has Ding Dong within his restaurant portfolio and it shows in the food and beverage experience. The cocktails are crafted and clever, always displayed in different vessels and reasonably prices.The food is designed to share and features amazing dumplings, roasted and curry dishes, and great highlights such as Rendang beef bun that just melts in your mouth. Bigger plates include the pork collar, and duck - which has a hoisin treatment to die for.The food and presentation is brilliant - put simply a funky and visual experience, where you are excited to see whats next, and how it will be brought to the table.The mood and staff are young, funky and the 80's retro music soundtrack gives you some spring in your step as you enter. Its a bell ringer every time - great food - great decor and great staff - don't change Ding Dong
4
I was here for dinner only once, but I must say that it is probably been the best food I had in Singapore. The quality of the dishes is very high and prices are "average".Definitely a place I would suggest to anybody having an hotel in the area 
5
All I can say is scotch eggs, a dish that I will remember for years. The rest of the food was also fabulous ( brisket Boa was also a standout) perhaps the small dishes outshone the mains and if I did return I would just have lots of those. I seriously considered going more than once on my trip to Singapore! But there is so much choice I didn't, and now just left dreaming of the scotch eggs and full of regret!
4
great night out enjoyed the style of many small dishes and share plates would visit again great experience
3
Came here for lunch today and opted for the duck breast main course. This was quite tasty, although a little tough in parts. Just a little small to be enough for lunch: probably need to supplement with a starter or dessert. Service was quite efficient.
4
Had 2 main courses, steak and tuna loin. Both were well executed. The buah keluak sauce went surprisingly well with the steak. Service was attentive. Overall, a very positive experience and definitely will return again.
5
Food was fantastic and definitely value for money since we used the entertainer app. Reservations is definitely necessary as the restaurant was packed with a steady stream of customers throughout the night. Would definitely return!
4
Place was hidden along the streets. Relatively quiet in the day, great for cosy dining. Decor of the place is very nostalgic and interesting! Great theme with the Asian fusion dishes. Food was innovative and brings out a nice balance between western and Asian cuisine
5
This is a pretty casual place really - shorts and Tshirts abound. The food is very, very good - the Vietnamese scotch eggs were delicious, as were the rending buns. Can't fault the food at all. It's a little cafeteria like, but in a fun way. Decent drinks as well. Very quick service in that Singaporean way, so don't come intending to linger! Happily recommended for great food in a laid back, fun environment.
4
We had the Salmon which was flavoured with Yuzu sorbet and Salmon Roe which was very nice, the salad which tasted a bit like rojak and a bit like Thai salad. This was supposed to be accompanied with chicken but we didn't see any. For the mains, we had the Wagyu steak which was very nicely done with black bean sauce! And the other main was lobster tail with baby corn and beans. The hot tom yam sauce was poured over the dish at our table. We had two desserts, a banana fritter caramelised with some sorbet and pastry. Excellent but not enough banana and another dessert
4
We came on a Friday night and the place was packed. Reservations needed! Had the lobster tom yum and green curry. Both were terrific. Goes well w the wine. Service could be improved. While servers were great, the hostess we had was not welcoming. We had the vibe that he she was being judgemental. It put me off on dining at ding dong in the futur
5
When I looked at the website I was not too excited but we went for a friend's birthday so follow the crowd.The food was outstanding. We had a 6 course tasting menu. Every dish we received was perfectly presented, amazingly delicious and came out at a very manageable pace. The waiting staff were very good as well. Fast and efficient.Highly recommend this restaurant as a must try. The decor inside is quite funky and what is great is that the kitchen is open for all to see so you therefore don't have to worry about the cleanliness of the food prep area.A fantastic and very memorable experience
4
The menu has evolved and simplified a bit. The greatest hits are still there, and the quality of the entrees is high. The Vietnamese Scotch Egg and the prawn are favourites, and easy to share for starters. The pork collar was given highest markers by a companion, as was the snapper and duck breast. The wine list is solid and well priced.Room for improvement: The acoustics inside are poor and it makes conversations among groups larger than two a bit challenging. When sitting outdoors, the music can be a bit loud, but they readily turned the volume down when I asked
5
The restaurant exceeded our expectations by far - the food was outstanding. Asian fusion with a twist would best describe the creative cuisine that positively inspired the eye as well as the tast buds. As for prices: For the quality we got it was a very fair deal. In most gourmet stops the food wouln't be better but definitively much more expensive. Staff was attentive and helpful, and the ambiente playful but stylish. In short: I highly recommend Ding Dong
4
As always it was a great evening at Ding Dong but disappointed to see that the duck curry is off the menu.
4
My 2nd time in Ding Dong restaurant in Amoy street. This time was with my friends for a Wednesday girl dinner. The restaurant was full and we were glad to made a reservation before.The place is a bit noisy. The staff is not really friendly, nor smiling, but quite efficient, at least acceptable but not really fancy.The food is inventive, a mix of Asian and Western flavours, and the dressing modern. All dishes is worth a photo and on the palate it is really pleasant.For couples I recommend the bar seating to enjoy the cook preparing the dishes in front of you
3
Came in for dinner and sat at the bar which was nice to watch the chefs preparing the food. Cocktails were good and so was the service but the whole experience was let down by very average food. Had the ding dong coleslaw for starters, this was probably the best thing I ate. Then the rendang bao, just extremely bland, no flavour, looked great but no taste. Also had the ribs, nice big portion but very dry and again flavourless, the peanut sauce accompanying it was not very saucey, not sure if you are supposed to spread this on or what but it didn't really work. Then had the char Siew pork, and marinade or sauce was almost flavourless, felt a bit let down by the whole thing. Shame as everything was great except the food.
5
We were surprised by the high standard of the tasty, beautifully presented and delicious food at Ding Dong. The new venue at Amoy Street might be smaller than the previous location, but the atmosphere is cosy and the full view into the preparation area is also comforting and interesting. We really liked this restaurant and will certainly return. Especially great choice to go with overseas guests to let them experience local tastes but in a nearly "fine dining" way
3
Interesting Asian-Fusian dishes in the menu. Ordered two small plates and two large plates. The pork ribs was tender and well seasoned. The rendang beef was juicy though the rendang taste was mild. Wagyu beef had a unique black sauce, but meat was tender! Tom yum lobster didn't have much tom yum taste and crab cake with sriracha was also weak. Black sesame brownie was moist and rich taste of sesame. Mandarin sorbet and freeze dried citrus fruit complemented the brownie well. Portions were small and on the pricey end. Cocktails were yummy.
3
This was a quick bite as I was in the area. Indoors felt cold but we could sit outside and watch the world go by. We ordered a tuna and a beef dish. The food was presented well and both dishes were of a high standard and tasty. But really quite small portions for the price; don't come here if you're particularly hungry unless you have deep pockets. Drink prices also at quite a premium
3
I'm not one to nitpick on beverages but if the only coffee you're serving is Vietnamese coffee, it needs to be up to standard. Instead it felt more like sugary, diluted 3-in-1. Food was amazing, loved the presentation and the details and the flavour. Very pretty and quirky space, great for hanging with friends or a fun date, however the 3 service staff were not as attentive as we would have preferred, especially since there were only about 4 tables of guests. On multiple occasions, especially in the second half of our meal, it took us a while to catch their attention as they would appear to either be using their phones or staring off into the distance
5
We came here after reading great reviews, and were not disappointed at all.Really love the decor of the place with fun old movie posters all over the walls. Food was just amazing, the Vietnamese scotch egg as previously mentioned in other reviews is amazing. We also had the scallop ceviche which was really great.Mains were just as good also, service was fast friendly and efficient.Really recommend this place if you want well presented and good food in a great environment
5
My girlfriend and I visited Ding Dong (one of the many places we ate in our two week trip across Singapore and Bali) and it's one of the best restaurants we ate at.We decided to go for the a la cartel menu and were very happy with our meals - which included the duck (a must have!) - but would love to revisit to try the tasting menu.Pretty decently priced in comparison to other places in Singapore with a cool vibe!
4
Had a business lunch there with some guests. It was a decently priced business set lunch and the dishes gave the guests a good taste of dishes that had a heavy south east asian influence.
4
Asian fusion! Yummy and fun. Cocktails are perfect and easy to drink. Every food presentation is detailed
5
highly rated and delivered. although we found this difficult to find the circuitous route and extra walking was rewarded by a very nice meal and cold beers. small shared plate style dining was exactly what we needed and enjoyed immensely.
2
 Not too often that I feel the need to leave a restaurant after eating the starters but this is one time that I have. Very, very average prawns and fatty ribs served in about 10 seconds flat suggesting well pre cooked. Disinterested staff. A shame - not recommended
3
Tuna was well cooked to rare, but the chilli was a tad too sweet, and the accompaniments for the other mains, the pork and the beef were on the sweet/bland side. Ambience of the place is nice and cosy. However, there was a group of ladies seated at the front of the room that was unbearably noisy throughout my entire dinner that was really annoying, which the service crew should have approached
4
what looks like a kitsch palace turns out to offer some interesting cocktails and a few really good dishes. best of the lot by far were the rendang been buns and the lobster tail tom yam. i'd probably go back just for that -- it was really an eye-opener in all the good ways. skip the pork knuckle -- billed as trotter, which is why i ordered it, it's a tasty but way too massive hunk of pork shank. the two of us barely dented it
5
The restaurant was buzzing on a Saturday night and has a great ambiance. The cocktails were quite unique with a touch of local spices - think ginger, wasabi etc, in them. For appetizers we got the beef buns, prawns tempura and crab dumplings - each of them were unique and flavourful, different from what you'd get at traditional restaurants. My pecking order was tempura, bun and then dumplings.For mains we got the lobstair tail in what appeared to be a Thai sauce and some more beef this time grilled. Both were served with rice and tasted very good, especially the Thai sauce accompanying the lobster. We skipped desserts. All in, a fantastic meal. Would surely visit again
4
Ding Dong redefined the traditional Singaporean Chinese food in a modern way and with a funky twist.The restaurant is converted from an old shophouse, which one could easily associate with a sense of history from the old; atmosphere was vibrant with a hybrid old and new decoration. It's a compact place hence booking is recommended.Concept of food was based on well known dishes but this was where the similarity ended; dishes were recreated in different shape and form, and in sampling sizes. They were delicious.This would be a place for pleasant surprises and a fun time, rather than one for experiencing traditional Chinese culinary arts
4
Wagyu striploin, buah keluah, confit shallot is the kind of menu item a character from the coming-to-your screens soon Hollywood adaption of Crazy Rich Asians might order. Don't let that put you off, Ding Dong's nouvelle-sized fusion food hits the spot. Like Ho Lee Fook in Hong Kong, it has an attitude about old attitudes. That means deserts like Coconut snow and pandan jelly noodle with gula melaka ice cream.Cocktail and wine-pairings too of course, and (not true of all Singapore joints) Wifi, We'll be back
5
We opted for the "feed me" menu and enjoyed every one of the 6 courses. The only item that we thought could have been improved was the tuna which we deemed a touch over-cooked and therefore rather dry.The speed of service was great...we never felt like we were waiting and never felt rushed.The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly. Would certainly recommend and return
5
We had a fabulous lunch at Ding Dong! The staff were knowledgeable and attentive. The food looked fantastic and tasted amazing! Will definitely go back!
3
Enjoyed the lovely ambiance, good music and kind staff. The menu was not very easy. Sharing platters with 2 or 3 items on it, are not very group friendly. But over all good experience, which would go again.
5
Really cute decor and delicious food. Old movie posters decorated the walls, casual atmosphere. The food was great, I recommend coming here for dinner
5
We are not dessert persons. So we took the two course meal of appetiser and main course for lunch (S$ 35 per person). Add S$10 and you‚Äôll get daiquiri.All of the main course are served with rice (it‚Äôs Asian, after all) and they are all superb. Although, as any fine dining, the portion is small. The service is excellent.The location is walking distance from/to CBD. The ambience has that Wong Kar Wai films vibe, with retro 60s interior design. Ideal for dating
5
Ding Dong - with the strains of ' a go go ' music in the background, is a pleasant trip back to yesteryear . Interesting & innovative takes on old - time favourites, the re interpreted classics aim to please . The tapas - sized servings worked well so we could try an assortment of items. Good place for bites to accompany good conversation and company 
4
It's a cozy restaurant with yummy food and friendly staff. We had the set lunch menu and it's price is a little pricey for lunch. However food was really good. We had the hamachi sashimi for appetiser and it was really refreshing and tasty. Our mains of wagyu beef and braised pork collar were really tender and flavorful. Lastly we had the deconstructed pineapple tart and mango sago were really interesting. We preferred the pineapple tart as it was a refined and exciting interpretation of taste. It was a pleasant lunch and we would be going back again
4
Amazing place to dine with friends or that special someone. My friend and I were sat at the bar which gave us great front row seat to the bar and the chefs. The cocktails were great and even for myself who was not drinking there were able to whip up some cracking stuff for me to enjoy. The chefs were working away and by work I mean carefully plating with precision each dish to perfection! I have attached menus of the food and some pics of the decor as well as the duck dumplings. Dumplings are what they are but the broth used to help bring out the flavour was amazing! The sharing dishes were great from the ribs to the carbon tempura prawns with a great lead up to the red snapper curry. The place is small and takes bookings in advance which is something noting. Enjoy the service and great food :-
4
My friends wanted to try some asian food so I searched on the entertainer app and found Ding Dong, a funny name for a restaurant. I was pleased to find it nicely decorated with a retro feel. The food was good but not very filling! We ordered the lobster tail from the "Big Plates" section thinking it would be good for sharing... well let's just say the plate was very big, and it looked bigger with the tiny amount of food in the center of it. Well, it is Singapore and these trendy restos can charge these high prices. At least none of the food was wasted cuz we ate every last morsel of it.
4
This is a great little restaurant in Amoy street, great service, exceptional food and a good vibe for a funky dinner in Singapore. this is a great place with a menu full of distinct taste and a cocktail menu to go with everything. Take your time and enjoy
3
Our first day in Singapore and we asked the concierge to recommend a good local restaurant that they would go to with friends and not a tourist trap or in a hotel. They told us had to go to DingDong. Our first disappointment was that the entire room was filled with Caucasians. Only the waitstaff were Asian. So no locals go there and it was a Friday night too. It took almost a half hour to get a vodka on the rocks and a scotch on the rocks. Three times the waitress couldn't remember what we asked for, finally we got a great gal and no problems there. We did the chefs tasting menu but the food was just OK. This is the first time we took a suggestion from any concierge person and was greatly disappointed
3
The food and atmosphere are good, but not good enough to make it stand out in a very competitive market in that part of the city. There are many options and this deserves a visit, but I will not be rushing back.
4
Had the 7 course taster menu, very interesting. Service a little rushed and water was $10 (ouch). Other than that a bit expensive for what you got but it did taste good
5
Great food selection. Pinotage was also excellent. Only thing I don't like is the 2-hour dining limit - this is dinner, not breakfast!
4
Decorated as if back in the seventies, the sensation of the dishes definitely will bring you idealism of the past!
4
Came here today for lunch and opted for the ocean trout as main whilst my lunch companion chose the crispy duck curry. Both were quite decent. Service was fast and efficient, if slightly lacking in warmth. Worth another visit.
4
We had the chef's sampling menu with 6 different dishes. A good mix of flavors. Loved the fish and pork.
3
It was a quiet afternoon during lunchtime. We stood there for some time before someone approached us. Would have been nice if we had a warm welcome. I must say I enjoyed the flavours of the food. Though the portion could have been more for the price. I would have enjoyed my meal more if service was more attentive and friendly
3
Went several times in their old location. This new incarnation can easily be skipped . Ordered the tasting menu and two extra large dishes ... Drinks took 20 min to arrive and had to be requested twice .. food took way to along to arrive in between each dish. Atmosphere very loud with pop music blasting out forcing everyone to speak louder and louder .... Bring back the old Ding Dong ...
4
A fresh and contemporary take on a food favourite. My Scotch Eggs were small but very tasty - a spicy take on an old fave.My Pork Spare Ribs with peanut sauce were a re-invention on Satay Sticks - great.Good service with a good wine list.It is also in a great area to take a stroll after you've likely eaten too much!
4
Ding Dong is originally more a pub, offering "Asian tapas" to go with your drink(s). Upon entering, its 70s movie poster wallpaper (think: Japanese Barbarella poster, Bruce Lee in 'The Big Boss') makes for a SE Asian speakeasy vibe. Set lunch offer three Asian-inspired choices: we made different selections, incl. a Soto Ayam-like appetizer, salmon sashimi with lychee granita, and a pork belly/ chicharon combo. Lunch was satisfying, and in fact quite filling despite seemingly small portions. And at $20+, this is quite worth it. Try it, and see for yourself
4
I definitely preferred the old menu, but the food here is still among the best of fusion dishes I have tried in Singapore. The new location works well too, and whilst the ambiance is great, the service is probably the one let-down of this place.
5
As always the food was brilliant but the service as always, a bit slow and you need to always call the staff, to take orders, order a new drink, clean your dishes, etc ... but the food is worth the so so service.
4
Food was unique and especially good. Never knew that they could be cooked in such different ways. It brings food to the next level
1
We had a very rude and condescending waiter who happens to be the standing restaurant manager. Lodged a complaint and did not get a response. Food was average too, only the pineapple dessert was decent. This place deserves to be shut down soon..
5
In this restaurant I want to order everything at once: confit of octopus, rice with mango, crab salad, scallops with Chinese cabbage. Chef Ryan Clift gathered in one menu, everything seems possible Asian snacks. These cocktails, like desserts, like Pirates of Malacca with rum with spices and palm sugar
3
The restaurant was located just across from the MRT station. The place was decorated in a loud and colorful way with lots of prints around. I was surprised that the place offered 3 course lunch set (S$38++) on sat and it was not crowded at all. The food offered here was a cross between East meet West, the fusion kind.Starter : Miso salmon gravadlax, ikura shoyu and yuzu sorbetThe sorbet was quite refreshing and tangy. One could not really taste the miso in the salmon.Main : Wagyu beef striploin, buah keluak sambal, seasonal mushroomI was attracted by the word "buah keluak" on the menu which made me ordered this dish. When the dish was served, I thought it was served with squid ink as the sauce was very smooth and dark in colour. Dishes with buah keluak were usually served in a coarse sauce. The taste of buah keluak was distinct in the sauce. The beef went quite well with the sauce. It was a different case for the mushrooms, which some tasted rather bitter while the big thin cracker like pieces were rather salty.Dessert : Jackfruit sticky rice, rice chip, coconut sorbetThe coconut sorbet was rich and creamy, but melted rather fast. As it was served on a flat rectangle, it was rather difficult to scoop. The sticky rice was a tab too dry. Would prefer it to be served hot and moist. Overall the food was interesting but the taste would need some improvement
3
Food was okay but nothing special. I was disappointed. I had been to that restaurant about 2 years ago on club street. I had a better experience then. We went on a Saturday night, very quite, very cold. I expect much more for the amount of our bill... Service was not very good either
3
We popped in to Ding Dong for lunch based on a review I had read in Australia and ordered the set menu of two courses. We both had the duck starter and enjoyed the tasty appetiser, leaving us looking forward to our main courses. However when they arrived they were smaller than we were expecting. My husband had the pork which he said had nice flavours but he would have liked more. I had the wagyu beef which was served with a strange black sauce that overpowered the other delicate tastes on the plate. With a beer each, this lunchtime meal set us back $90 (Singapore) and I'm not sure we really got value for money
3
I went there with friends on a friday night for some cocktails. Well, it's just "ok" We also ordered glasses of beers and they charge us the price of a pint even if the glass was not the proper ones.. perhaps the food is better 
5
After 3 days of trying to get into this place (they were closed) we finally had the opportunity to visit Ding Dong! Right in Chinatown - its a great lunch stop. We had the delectable Vietnamese Scotch Eggs and a few cocktails - the Monkey's Run and Apricot Daquri were both amazing and worth trying! The Daquri was served with freeze dried passion fruit - a nice addition to a very tasty drink! We recommend all 3 of these items! Angelina was fantastic and very informative on local spots! Worth the hype you read everywhere

Nice Ambience and theme to the restaurant that is different. Food is not bad, fusion. Good for gatherings to somewhere different.
4
Good food nice decor. Fun place to hang out. Some hits and misses. Interested to try their dinner menu
5
I use this restaurant a lot and always love the food service and ambiance. The food is really clean tasting, fresh and excellent combination of flavours. Keep up the good work
5
We went to lunch at Ding Dong this week.. their 2 or 3 course lunch menu is so interesting but most importantly delicious but different and also good value .
4
We stumbled upon Ding Dong quite by accident as we were heading further up to Chinatown but as we were tired decided to stop and have dinner there. Best decision - food was spectacular. We had the duck curry and 'red chicken'. Innovative cuisine with fresh ingredients and to top it off, friendly and warm service. We sat outside & enjoyed people watching although there seemed to be ample seating available inside in the air conditioning. Highly recommended
4
The food was Ding Dong was all cooked to perfection and the Banana bread with Duck Liver was worth all the hype. The service was fabulous too.However, our group found the portions a bit tiny (had to tell my friends that the mains were mains since they thought I'd ordered more starters). My Japanese-inspired cocktail was way too hipster - served in a tiny tiny bottle and definitely not worth the $ tag! Desserts were Banana Fighter and Choc Madness - both delicious and unique
4
I've been to Ding Dong many times and usually recommend it to friends when visiting. It's quality has slipped recently (service particularly), but it's still a pretty good spot. Food is on the more expensive side for the portion size, but it's very nice. You should try it once for an experience.
4
Love the new location. Acoustics at the previous address was terrible. The food and service is still great. Good wine selection and great value for money. We had the chefs menu which meant every dish was a surprise. Waiter asked if we had any particular dislikes and then passed it onto the chef. It was excellent. It was the best decision to put it in the chefs hands, as we may have not been too adventurous. Will be back again
2
Food - overall not bad, though portions on the small side.Service - forgettable, bordering on poor. Had a birthday cake, yet staff didn't bother providing a knife to cut it with. No water top-ups. Was informed in advance that we needed to vacate the table by 9.30pm (two hour seatings), which is acceptable, however instead of a verbal reminder, waiter stood by our table and dramatically looked at his watch for a prolonged period. Not looking for 5-star service, but didn't expect a lack of basic service
5
When we arrived at Ding Dong we knew that the recommendation from the Danish embassy was a great one. The food is very tasty and the service was polite and with a lot of personality. We sat outside and enjoyed a "Feed me menu". I will come back for more.
5
Top spot for a quick biz lunch. Nicely prepared, very visually stimulating. Nice mix of flavours. Really fresh and contemporary. Good value.
2
This resaurant tries hard but the food is awful. Nothing tasty, all dishes are funky in a bad way and the service is mediocre too. I wish it were better. There's a lot of room for improvement.
4
Cute retro interior decor. It's like walking right into the Bruce lee era. Love the concept. Simple and concise lunch menu but the offering was spot on. Food was on point, look forward to going back to try out other dishes.
5
We had heard about this restaurant and decided to pop in one night. We had an amazing meal. I had the wagu which had been slow cooked. It was so tasty and tender. My husband had a curry which he enjoyed. The staff were lovely and competent. We sat outside and watched the world go by. Great night
4
After 3,5 weeks in Asia (Chiengmai, HK, Bali, Jakarta), our final culinary leg in Singapore. We were really taken away by all of the 5 different dishes that we tasted. Very innovative (f.i. the sashimi) and tasteful (pisang desert). Best sorbet ever.Only drawback is the non-inspiring view from the streetwalk to the other side of the street. Be aware, the address has changed to number 1 Amoy st and not 115
5
In a city with multiple, extraordinary eating places, Ding Dong stands out for me. I've been before but this was the first time at the new address at 115 Amoy Street. Totally different fit out, same buzzy, vibe. The menu has some changes (sadly, no more 48 hour beef cheek) but thankfully, the carbon wrapped prawns are still there as are the Vietnamese scotch eggs. I would cross oceans for those eggs. The staff are a huge asset to this restaurant, coping admirably with our large, loud, boozy group. Better order in some more bubbles, guys, because I'll definitely be back.I will certainly keep coming back
3
I went to Ding Dong in their old multi-story location in a charming building with smaller rooms and an overall nicer atmosphere. Their new location is bright, loud 80's music, and just doesn't have a good layout. Food is very tasty, but the atmosphere comes off as a loud US diner. It's a shame they changed a god thing....Service was also spotty
3
We had dinner here and while the atmosphere and service were fine we found the dishes served a little mixed. We opted for the Feed Me menu that serves a bit if everything. There were some interesting dishes but the fish was stuffy and portions on the very small side considering what you pay. I will not return at this price
5
My wife and I really enjoyed our visit. It wasn't just the food but the whole experience.We had seats at the bar and it was entertaining watching the food and the cocktails being made. They even cut the ice for the cocktails.We went for the option of the chefs choice including sweets. Good move. We got a really nice variety of food. The ribs were the best I have ever tasted. The sweets were exquisite. Overall the food was of a really high standard.The wine is expensive so my recommendation would be to ditch the wine and go for the cocktails which were excellent.Ok this wasn't cheap- not allot of places in Singapore are- but we had a really enjoyable evening and would certainly recommend this restaurant
1
Came to Ding Dong based on friend's recommendation, price is slightly on the high side while portions are small, food was enjoyable and creative, and the cocktails were good. Bill came to around 250sgd for decent amount of food and 3 cocktails for 3 people.However, in this restaurant, if you are Asian or have a darker skin tone, you will be treated like you are here to beg for food, the attitude of the indian manager towards us and the white expats was so obviously different and you do not need to be an expert to feel it. We ordered the Wangyu Char Siu based on friend's recommendation, and was told by this indian restaurant manager that it was sold out for the day, we were disappointed but agreed to order something else. However while we were finishing our main course, guess what happened? The table with 5 white guys behind us who have just arrived, ordered 2 portions of the Wangyu Char Siu, and the dish was all of a sudden available! We immediately check with this indian manager again, and he started to come out with plenty of excuses and lies which make no sense, at first his excuse was that was for a special menu, so we asked why was this menu not mentioned to us when we wanted the Wangyu Char Siu, and he immediately changed his excuse and said the portion that served to the table behind us was of a smaller size and he thinks it will not be sufficient for us. Lame! Did we receive an apology, of course not.At first we thought this indian restaurant manager was maybe having a bad day, but figured this indian manager is just a white boot licker who thinks money from an Asian is no good in his restaurant.So if you are an Asian or have a darker skin tone, skip this place, you are not welcome here.If you are a White person, the price you pay includes a free boot lick from the indian manager, I am pretty sure if you bring a few more pairs from your home he will gladly lick them clean for you too
5
A great restaurant. Bright, colourgul and relaxed with fun staff and delicious food. The daquiri with freeze dried raspberries was delish and the deconstructed pineapple tart amazing. Great for a relaxed night out.
4
Although with a funny name like Ding Dong rings in the mind of locals and expats for a good night of dinner plus drinks. Although a bit on the pricey side, the food and cocktails are excellent.
5
We had an amazing meal here last Saturday night. The portions are on the small side, but the taste of the food 100% justifies it. We particularly loved the Rendang and Ocean Trout. Great atmosphere too! You won't be disappointed.
4
This is a very lively little place on the fringes of China Town. The feel and vibe is very modern and the customers all seem to fit that criteria. The food was excellent, my only negative is that the vegetarian options were very limited, otherwise a fabulous funky spot
5
Have dined at this restaurant 3 times now and will definitely return when i come back to Singapore.The food is fresh and exciting. Have opted for the tasting plate on all visits so as to get a wide sample of the menu.The wine list is small but i am sure everyone can find something they like. It's about the food, not the wine in this establishment.Love the modern decor with table and bar seating. Loved loved loved the 80s disco background music.It is a small restaurant so bookings are essential.It's a must try for foodies who enjoy modern asian fusion cuisine.
4
This place is perfect if you're looking for a good night out with some friends. The food is more than decent and the atmosphere is great. We went on a Tuesday night and it was buzzing with conversation and music. That may have to do in part with their very good cocktail list. I'd recommend going here. The food isn't fantastically amazing, but you'll have a good meal at a good price
4
Ding Dong is a funky and fun venue. I ate at Ding Dong for lunch - we had a seat at the bar. Ding Dong has a good set lunch at S$30+++ for two courses and S$40+++ for three courses. I chose the chicken coleslaw as an entree and fish for the main. I also had the mango dessert. The entree and main were very food but dessert was quite large and overly sweet. They were also able to accommodate the dietary restrictions of my vegetarian colleague. They also served Vietnamese coffee. Service was efficient and friendly. I will be back.
4
The restaurant has now moved to Amoy Street. Its the former site of a famous hokkien restaurant (Beng Hiang) I think. Decor is great, music is very retro 70s and 80s. Food selection was good. Menus was very interesting and seriously good variety like Sheep's tongue serves satay style. Service was excellent and waiters made good effort to explain every dish and sauce. The only ONE complaint which I hope the restaurant would take seriously was the Ding Dong Daiquiri. At S$18.00 per cup it should not be served in a plastic starbucks Frappucino type cup. Would have added one more star to my review if served in a nice cocktail glass which I can toast the whole night through. Plastic really a turnoff. Especially high priced plastic convenience
4
(this restaurant was relocated to 115 Amoy Street)be sure to make a reservations because it is gonna be crowded.servings are good for sharing and presentation of the food was awesomei am not going to tell you what is nice and not because they will surprise you :)you can expect your Asian food, with a twist
4
Great spot amongst the hustle and bustle of club st area. We went on a saturday night. it wasn't too crowded but my advice is to book. Service staff were helpful in giving guidance and recommendations on the menu and number of dishes to order. You could order for yourself but it is really geared to plate sharing. we had some delicious plates. as the restaurant describes itself, it is a fusion of asian and western. reasonably priced especially if you don't over order. I would definitely head back again
5
A hidden gem in the heart of the city, Ding Dong was worth the effort to find the location and sort through the options on the menu.
5
Came here with a colleague and we both really liked the food.
Interesting menu of dishes I would choose. Efficient service and although expensive, I think it may justify it in the context of Singapore
4
Really enjoyable fusion food, cool vibe, the "scotch eggs" were very clever and the lobster was great. We ended up with a table by the toilet, though we didn't have a reservation so that's our fault.
5
Excellent food and great service ! Just launched their new menu and the scallops are heavenly just like everything else üòä ordered one dish after the other as we could not get enough of the awesome flavors!!
5
Had a great dinner. The table where not the best but we didn't care.
We had 4 cocktails each and a great dinner.
Service where good and we enjoyed it.
Go there.
4
We wanted to try a new restaurant in Ang Siang Hill and chose a great one in Ding Dong. We had a very nice table upstairs seated on very soft stools with foot rests included. The staff were helpful and provided advice on the menu including the favorites. We decided to order a la carte so the 4 of us could try more dishes. Some came in 3's however were not too hard to split. The Chicken coleslaw, Prawn tempura and Duck wontons were the top in the small plates and the Beef Rendang and Wagyu Beef Char siew were melt in your mouth delicious. Definitely will return again
5
Excellent food. A strange name for a restuarant, with it's casual funky interior, but boy is the food is good. It's creative without being too intellectual, a mix of asian and western fusion, presented in a confident balance of food appreciation and food cultures. Take the set menu and let your taste buds be delighted
5
A lively little restaurant in an old heritage building off club street. Good food, friendly staff and an inventive cocktail list... I've been to this restaurant a couple of times while passing through Singapore. Both meals were excellent - on the first of my visits I tried a number of dishes from their standard menu. The second coincided with the World Gourmet Summit, when they played host to visiting chef Chris Donnellan. As a result they were showcasing a very reasonably priced six course tasting menu... All six courses were great - although the smoked trout tartare and coconut prawns really stood out.

Did some research on Ding Dong and thought it would be a great venue to try whilst working in Sing. On arrival the decor and location was great so first impressions √¢≈ì‚Ä¶ From this point it was downhill. The service was OK, however the food portions and variety was really limited. Needless to say after eating 5 courses we had to order another small plate and dessert to feel remotely full. To be balanced the food was tasty and well presented. As per reviews the Scotch Eggs, Soft Shell Crab, Duck dumplings, Home made Pancake with pork belly finishing with the Pork Rib were all good BUT expensive and not what you would expect as a "Filling Meal" A comparison would be Yardbird in the Soho district in Hong Kong which serves similar food, big servings, amazing Japanese Yakatori at a very reasonable price! By Comparison, Ding Dong is a place you visit once to say you have sampled the venue but go elsewhere in the future. In parallel, Yardbird is a place in HK I visit over and over again, never walking out hungry with plenty of change in my pockets for next time! Try it next time in HK!

Ding Dong is an interesting one for me. It's a place with such good reputation however I can't see why. The food is good but not incredible but if you coupled it with good service and a smile I would say it would have a chance. But here is where it lacks. It's got a hefty price tag with a diner style service. No one meeting you at the door. 15 minutes without someone asking if we need a drink. And it persists at both visits. I'd make suggestion of some management that's aware of how their staff are servicing their customers. So the good:-The meals are good and desserts incredible. Honestly I'd go back for dessert itself. - location is great- the lady who cleans the table up was stellar. Smile and chatty. A keeper. The bad:- service - reception on arrival - service
5
Situated just off China Town food Street . Small restaurant, excellent staff and very helpful. Most delicious meal we have had here in Singapore, though pick carefully and ask the head waiters advice for suggestion. Food clean, fresh and portions suited to sharing
4
Had a really good night at this spot
Leave it to the Manager to 'Feed Me' !
Love the soft shell crab and the belly pork
Only about twenty covers
Popular take away downstairs
Limited WC accommodation
Fair price
No smoking
5
Cute little establishment . Great service. Innovative twist on local food packed with wonderful flavours.
Creative cocktail selection. It's a great place for a fun night out with family and friends.
Ask the staff for recommendations. We absolutely loved everything we had.
4
We ate here on the recommendation of our hotel as we were looking for a sensibly priced Asian meal.As we entered off the street past the kitchen I wasn't sure but as we were shown up stairs to our seat at the bar it all was fine. Sitting at the bar meant we were entertained by the lady behind the bar making cocktails at this quite lively little restaurant.We selected a couple of small plates (Chicken Coleslaw and Blackcarbon Prawn) one big plate (Beef Rendang) and a desert (Bananna pudding). Although the portions weren't huge there was enough food for the two of us. The staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful
4
Would definitely recommend. Was mildly concerned because of other comments on here but absolutely no need to be. Best drinks: Golden Mile and Giddy Up. Not to be missed. Food: Scotch Eggs, Duck Dumplings, Tartare. Only (slight) moan was that the soft shell crab was a little over-fried. Salad that came with it was beautiful though and a perfect contrast. Add it to your to do!
4
Excellent fusion experience. Service is attentive and knowledgeable. Cocktails are inventive and tasty. We selected our own menu and the cold small plate highlights were the scallop ceviche and the spicy beef salad. For the hot small plates, be sure to try the carbon-battered prawn tempura with red curry marinade and soy wasabi marinade - better yet, get two of those. The wagyu beef char siew was very good for a large plate entr√©e. Best of all were the "textures of chocolate & kaya" and especially the light but very tasty "cula malacca with sago pudding & coconut". The popcorn garnish on the latter, plus the small merengues made the latter.
3
Food was OK, but small portions indeed. Roast duck dumplings were a good intro, but comprised three small parcels only with a small bowl of consomm√©. Wagu beef char siew was tender but only because it was so fatty. Beef rendang was the highlight. Got stung for S$10 for a bottle of water and a breathtaking S$30 for two halves of the local beer on draught. I'm sure there's better value meals to be had in the area. We only chose on the basis of the Leslie Phillips catchphrase (UK readers-specific link)- that'll teach us
3
This tiny little spot looks like an game hall, neon lights and an open kitchen reminds me of an American delivery service for Asian food. But when you go upstairs, you will find a nice modern restaurant with chairs and tables all over the place.The good is very tasteful, and the combination is great. I hadn't any idea behind the names, but got a delicious menu.Well I would come back ;
5
after other holiday plans fell thru, we decided to join my youngest son and his partner in Singapore for the 50th anniversary of independence new yr celebrations. he did some research prior to our arrival and we met them for new yrs eve dinner. opted for the 6 course degustation option rather than the alacart or "feed me" option. considering the prices and entry costs being charged in many other Singapore venues that night we thought the ? $80 per head price was a bargain and food was exceptional. service was bright and cheery and indeed I think we were the last table to leave. we'd been upstairs but met all the staff on the mid bar level on departing and they were certainly jovial and ready to party and begin their new yr, but absolutely no pressure for us to move on. memorable night
4
This is a great nice option for couples or groups - although it can get quite noisy at peak dining times. The menu has some interesting flavours - try the carbon battered prawn tempura (with red curry marinade & wasabi mayonnaise) and soft shell crab with an apple slaw. Good wine and cocktail list. Perfect for a date night, or with a group of friends, before heading down to Club Street for drinks
4
An imaginative menu of local flavors aimed at a modern healthy palate. Interesting drink menu. If you want to talk to others in your party, avoid the third floor - if its busy it's an echo chamber.
5
A friend recommended this place to me for the set lunch and I enjoyed it. Very cute setting and fun to walk around Chinatown. Great Asian fusion and the drinks list was solid.
5
Still one of my absolute favourites in Singapore. The food is consistently interesting and excellent! Don't expect a quiet dining room and maybe do that romantic date somewhere else, but in all other cases, spend your cash here!!
3
We had the Vietnamese scotch eggs, duck dumpling, crispy duck curry, beef rendang, and three beers. At almost 160 SGD, that doesn't feel like good value for money -- two nights ago we had a lot more (and better) food and twice as many drinks at the Neon Pigeon for just slightly more than that
5
I was keen to try Ding dong cos it sounded quite interesting but was not keen to fight the madding crowds. So I went for an early lunch ($25 but nearly $30 with tax & tip). It was delicious, well balanced for flavour and texture, and I didn't feel over full afterwards. This was particularly good in the heat. Service was attentive, not intrusive.Highly recommend.
3
I have to say my wife loved it previously, so maybe it was me going in with high expectations. The rendang was pretty good but the rest of what we had was only what you would expect from a normal restaurant. My wifes dessert though was literally one bite of ice cream with a horrible charcoal biscuit with dry ice for whatever rip off price it was. The cocktails were very good though
5
At first I was concerned nobody was at the restaurant, but then discovered that this place is spread over three levels. It's a cool little place, and they have a 'feed me' option which means we didn't even have to look at the menu. We got a huge amount of some extremely tasting modern Asian food, and washed it down with a few beers.It looked like it was very popular with the expat crowd, with lots of tables of regulars having fun
4
Come early & have a drink at the bar. They make very interesting cocktails inspired by local flavours like Milo. We ordered the "Feed Us" because it was the best way to enjoy a bit of everything. The food is designed to be shared so try to come in a group. Everything was very tasty but what stood out were the roasted black miso kingfish wing & homemade black miso tofu. Good flavours & textures, well-executed dishes. It's a stylish space in the trendy Ann Siang area but it's not fussy. Good vibe, quite chilled
5
Visiting Singapore to see family, we had the pleasure of seeing Club St through a locals eyes. Ding Dong was an absolute delight! We were in food heaven! A range of Asian fusion, the Blue Lobster Bao is to die for, my mouth is watering right now...A nice range of "left of centre" cocktails and wine, no beer. Try the Vietnamese coffee cocktail for something different.With four of us having 2 courses plus 3 cocktails each, we were looking at a bill around $360 SGD. not bad for the quality and taste sensation we experienced.We went on a Saturday night, it was busy and noisy as you would expect with a small restaurant, definitely worth the visit.We'd absolutely return when next in Singapore
4
Was recommended ding dong by a friend. Was not disappointed. Went with the set menu. Food was good and good size for sharing. We had to sit outside as is popular and a lot of the internal tables are set up for couples. If you have a larger group recommend that you try and book if you want to sit inside. Would recommend
4
Great little place for dinner. In a very cool part of town surrounded by bars for pre or post dinner drinks and very close to Chinatown. Small restaurant so make sure you book. Exciting and different food...lovely cocktails.
5
Great experience, really enjoyed the tasting menu, cocktails, wine, attentive service. It is pricey, but a worthwhile treat.
4
Revisited asian food cooked in a perfect way.
Dishes are a bit small.
Courtous staff.
A bit too noisy, difficult to speak normally
5
Short but unique menu, very attentive staff on the ambient Club Street. The staff were happy to accommodate my vegetarian request and took their time to introduce the meals and some background to the chef & other restaurants.
4
Lovely food and wine at reasonable prices! Visited on a sat night, the street was blocked off either end to allow for diners to eat out on the street and walk freely. Fantastic area!
5
Through a random contact on Instagram, we were pointed in the direction of Ding Dong for dinner on the night we arrived in Singapore. As we were staying in Chinatown, the location was excellent (only a few minutes walk from our hotel) and the vibe when we turned into Ann Siang Street was pretty cool. Whilst mostly "expat" there were some locals, and we merrily found our way to Ding Dong.We sat upstairs next to the bar, which was initially quite quiet, but as the night went on turned into a busier place. We grazed on a selection of plates including the amazing "carbon" prawns and excellent ribs (as well as some fantastic lobster "bao"). The beer was cold and the cocktails good. We probably had too much as there wasn't room for desert, but we wandered back to our hotel, very content with our first night's dinner in SIN
5
Great food, a nice balance of traditional flavors and modern twists, with Malay, Vietnamese, and Thai jumpoff points. Trendy, sure, but not pretentious and decoration is fairly sparse. As with most restaurants in the Club St. area it is a little pricey but well worth it. We had a hard time making menu choices initially, but luckily they do set and tasting menus, which worked out great and we liked not knowing what the next course would be. Dishes came out 2/time, and even included 2 different desserts, which were incredible. Cocktails tend slightly towards the sweet, but I noticed that to be common across SE Asia and just a little off from my personal tastes.
5
My wife and I loved this place, our favourite in SIngapore! Situated in Ann Siang Rd (near Club St) in a tight and cluttered street, you really feel you're in old Singapore when you arrive. The decor is modern and bright with a circular stair case that takes you up 2 extra floors from the ground. It is touted at modern Vietnamese but it seemed like a really eclectic mix of Asian with many dishes I have never had before. A lot of the dishes are share plates which is great when you're with a couple of friends. Service was attentive but I would say that a description of each dish would have been useful. Take a walk down to Club St for an after-dinner drink
4
Ding Dong is located in a very cool area and we were lucky enough to be there after the street it is located on had been closed off and the whole place just comes alive. But back to the actual restaurant - I visited with a a group of 4 friends for dinner. The service was impeccable all night, I don't think my water glass was ever empty and plates were arriving and cleared at just the right times. The food was delicious, what I would call 'modern asian' some new and interesting twists on classics. The one thing that disappointed me was the size of the portions, if you were going to dinner here as a couple then the mains would be fine to share but in a bigger group you were lucky to get 1 piece of meat from eat of the mains. So much so that we put in a second round order of main dishes and still had room for dessert!
4
I was visiting my cool niece in Singapore and she had been recommended to Ding Dong. As we arrived we were shown to a table in the back by the toilet and we didn't want to sit there, we were offered another table by the manager who had a lot of attitude. Waited a while for our drinks and ordered lots of food, the first two courses arrived fast then we waited and waited, the manager who had a lot of attitude arrived with one of five we were waiting for, placed it on the table and as he was leaving I said to him I was a food critic in NY, everything changed, polite, food arrived, fresh plates after every course. I highly recommend this place though and can't stop thinking about the Chicken cole sla
5
Haven't had a bad dish from this restaurant. Honestly, everything is just devine. The flavours, oh my Gosh. Particular favs are the pork buns, beef curry, vietnamese chicken coleslaw and the blackened cod. Delicious - can't wait to go back!
5
I came here on Monday and when I had to find a restaurant to bring some friends for lunch, this was the first place that came to mind. My friends were ok to have modern South-East Asian food, as we had gone to the usual Italian and Chinese restaurants for our past meals. I opted to order dishes different from my last visit, to try items on their menu that I had not had before.Here are the highlights of my meal:- Vietnamese Chicken coleslaw: $17. This was served in a bowl with chopsticks in a nifty holder. The coleslaw comprised bean sprouts, chinese cabbage, carrots, japanese cucumber, asian herbs, strips of tender chicken breast and fried shallots. The salad is tossed with vietnamese dressing - lime juice, garlic, chilli and fish sauce which gave it a light and refreshing taste! Ladies will love this.- Roasted Duck Dumpling, Shitake Mushroom with Duck Consomm√©: $18. House-made dumpling filled with minced roast duck and shitake mushroom. When serving this, our server poured the duck consomm√© out from a teapot. It‚Äôs served with cut chilli padi on the side, my server suggested to throw in the chilli into the consomm√© for a different taste. The chilli padi gave the taste a good kick, and boy, it was hot/ spicy! I could only manage two pieces of the chilli padi. Proceed with caution on the chilli padi!- Soft Shell Crab with Apple & Shiso Slaw: $17. 2 whole soft shell crabs coated with Japanese 7-spices and deep fried. I loved the grated green apple and OHBA slaw on the side which was crunchy and delicious. It comes with a yuzu mayonnaise dip that‚Äôs house made. A must-try!- Tom Kha Crispy Quail: $23. The quail is deboned, marinated with ginger, galangal and lemongrass, cooked sous vide, coated with corn starch and then deep fried. There were two pieces, the dark (quail thigh and leg) and white meat (quail breast meat). The meat is moist and tender, even the white meat, which is good. The sauce was coconut milk based and was mildly spicy and sour, giving it a unique flavour. There was also enoki mushrooms in this dish which were also good. I will order this dish again. Recommended!- Homemade Pancake with Spiced Minced Pork & Kaffir Lime Yoghurt: The pancake reminded me a lot of crispy prata. This was served like a taco, with the minced pork filling and topped with a mint leaf. The kaffir lime yoghurt is excellent. If the restaurant bottle this and sell it, I will buy it. Add it to the pancake before biting into it and it gives a nice smooth texture to taste. After finishing my pancake, I even used my spoon to scoop out the rest of the yoghurt. Also guilt-free dining, cos its yoghurt. Must-try!- Malacca Chendol 2013: $15. This is a creation of the restaurant‚Äôs founder ‚Äì Chef Ryan Cliff. The 2013 is the year that the dessert is created. It‚Äôs an interpretation of the chendol dessert. Served in a granite bowl, similar to Korean Bibimbap bowl, it has shaved ice below, and topped with gula Melaka jelly, ice cream and pop corn. At our table, the server poured Gula Melaka sauce over the dessert. What‚Äôs different is that this dessert doesn‚Äôt have the green chendol strips, which I would have liked. I liked the Gula Melaka jelly, which had a good taste and was chewy.Another good meal at Ding Dong, and I definitely like the food here enough to come by two times in three days. And no, I am not ‚ÄòDing Dong‚Äô!Try it
5
We went to Ding Dong during the daytime. It's a small restaurant. And it was not very crowded. One other table was a mixture of locals with British, Americans, and Australians. The food was really good, the soup and another dish had bubbles on them, which looked high-end. The price for the set lunch was reasonable. And the desserts were really good :
5
Given the fast turnover of nice restaurants in Singapore, you should try this place sooner rather than later!The food was awesome. Normally I'm not really a fusion-restaurant lover but the chefs at this place really know what they are doing. It felt like a culinary quickie around Asia with the pork being served Taiwanese "gua-bao" style. Beef redang was juicy. I was most impressed by the Egg entree.We also had the "house" wine from barrell around 1.5L for the 4 of us, the white was good.Bill came to around USD250 for 4, not cheap for a very casual dining ambience, but the food was worth it
2
Expecting good things after reading reviews on here.Started off with v small cocktails for $20 ,service was patchy.Made error in electing for their shared menu-expected them to try and impress but got things like bland tofu dishes.Wished we picked ourselves may have enjoyed it more.Not impressed

Not the place for a quiet conversation, but if you are in the mood for seriously good food, this is where you want to be heading. We ate our way pretty much through most of the menu and there was honestly not a dud among them. Doing Asian in a modern way can lead one to overload the flavours and end up with a certain loss of identity. The DingDongers are models of restraint in this respect. Simple dishes with subtly layered flavours showcase ingredients with no more than a hint at an Asian identity. And that is not a shortcoming, quite the contrary. The gentle interpretations prevent the tastebuds from early fatigue and allowed us to eat on and on and on. My personal favourite was a very perfectly dressed aubergine dish. The service was friendly, if somewhat slapdash, but honestly, I doubt you will mind, as the place has no pretense of being anything but a very casual restaurant (with a seriously talented chef).

I have walked past this restaurant along Ann Siang Hill many times, and always thought it was a place for Dim Sum, with the neon lights and open kitchen on the ground floor reminding me of Hong Kong food stores. I had a chance to visit them for lunch recently.The restaurant occupies 3 floors, with the reception and kitchen occupying the first floor, main dining area and bar on the second floor and the third floor for dining and functions.The restaurant offers modern South-East Asian cuisine, with a modern take on traditional favourites from South East Asia.Here are the highlights of my meal:Appetisers- Burnt Nasu with Crab and Crispy Shrimp: $20. The skin of the eggplant is burnt, peeled and made into garnish. Loved the crab meat and the tangy sauce. Recommended!- ‚ÄòNan Ru‚Äô Pork ribs with Ginger and Apricot dip: $17. The pork ribs are marinated with fermented beancurd and this dish is from the chef‚Äôs childhood. Good tasting and the ginger and apricot sauce is refreshing. - Carbon-battered Red Curry Prawn Tempura with Soy Wasabi Mayonnaise Dip: $16. It looks like seaweed wrapped prawns, but its not! The outer shell is super crispy. I got to experience different tastes from this dish by eating it on its own, then squeezed some lime over it and finally ate it with the dip. I can eat this dish all by myself. The dip is salty, so dip in moderation!Mains- Crispy duck curry with cauliflower and passionfruit: $27. This is their interpretation of Thai Duck Red Curry. It has raw shaved cauliflower. The crackers were interesting, which was house-made and made with duck breast meat and tapioca flour blended together, gone through a special preparation process and deep fried. The curry is spicy and packs a good punch. Good to eat with rice.- Asam Pedas Saltwater Barramundi with okra and baby eggplant: $22. Fish is fresh and nicely grilled. Taste of the asam pedas is authentic and it hits the mark! Must-try!- Wagyu Beef Char Siew, Pickled papaya and Cherry Tomato: $25. The Wagyu beef is cooked for 48 hours in 57 degrees water bath. The white shallot oil powder is to die for. It also has pickled papaya and freeze-dried cherry tomatoes. Excellent!Dessert- Banana and Malay Steamed Cake: $15. Different textures of banana: sliced banana fruit, banana ice-cream, banana gel, banana jelly skin with banana cream within. The last reminded me of ‚ÄòTokyo Banana‚Äô dessert. Good to order and share.- Ding Dong Mango: $17. This is the restaurant‚Äôs take on Mango Lassi drink. I liked the varied textures of mango: mango ice-cream, freeze dried mango chips and mango jelly cubs. The other unique ingredients were sour cream, dehydrated yoghurt meringue and deep fried sago. What I also liked is the shiso shoots which is used as a garnish. Eaten with the dessert, its gives dimension and flavour. Now that‚Äôs a lassi you can eat!Cocktail- Golden Mile: $17. Thai herb infused vodka, blue ginger gomme and citrus. It has a lemongrass flavour and the 3 added drops of chilli oil enhanced the flavour and reminded me of tom yum soup. Nice!The portions served here are decent and filling. The restaurant also have good value 3 course set lunch for $25++, with choice of at least 3 items for starter, mains and desserts. Service is also good, where the staff explaining the dish when they are served. Staff is also friendly.Recommended

A stunning little bar that caters for a wide age group. My daughter and her boyfriend brought me here. Started off with a cocktail concoction that set off the standard for the rest of the evening. Scotch eggs with perfect soft egg yolks, a duck dumpling in a sublime consumme, was pushed to try pigs ears, yes you read that right. It had a crunchy texture like crackling and we loved it. The beef cheek rendang melted in your mouth was the highlight. Dessert that stood out was the trio of chocolate. Great service and ambience. Will be back when I visit again
4
The Iberico pork nap and Vietnamese scotch eggs small plates were a great starters for 3 people. Of the bigger plates, both the Crispy pork belly as well as the Waygu beef char siew were delicious. Portions are small. Service is good. The location is trendy with a bit more of an old Singapore appearance. Good drinks list; perfect to top off with a Vietnamese coffee.
5
Had a great meal in this smashing place on Ann Siang Hill. Belly pork buns were great but Vietnamese scotch eggs and duck dumplings in duck broth were outstanding. Great confit duck curry, well priced wine by the carafe and efficient, friendly service. A standout experience from our short visit to Singapore
4
Interesting drinks concept. I love how they way they incorporated their drinks theme with the glasses they use. Good place to chill in my opinion.
4
Fun atmosphere, yummy food with an interesting twist. We loved the Vietnamese scotch eggs, lamb ribs and pork bau! Didn't rate the rendang.
3
Ended up here on a Friday when most other restaurant are fully booked and this place still accepted walks-ins. The restaurant serves up some modern south east asia food and half of the dishes were eally good and half were just average or below.
4
We enjoyed this eclectic fusion modern Vietnamese restaurant. The service was very attentive, the food was all tasty and well prepared. The flavors were outstanding and all dishes were fresh and unique. It is a fun place with a hip vibe. Nice for a casual meal with cocktails and would recommend when in Singapore
5
Ding Dong offers a great variety of food and drink and, most importantly, a great short rib as well as variety of other dishes. Could and used to go to Ding Dong all the time as it's a refreshing break from Singapore cuisine at reasonable enough prices even if the Singapore food scene is stepping up in a big way over the last year and a half or so.
3
Ding Dong in the trendy Ann Siang Hill area is the brainchild of Chef Ryan Clift. I visited on a rainy Monday afternoon for a casual laid back lunch. Standouts include the Vietnamese Scotch eggs, Blue lobster buns with hoisin sauce & Five Spice lamb ribs. Portions are meant for sharing so best to have 2 people go to share. Other dishes were underwhelming like kingfish sashimi whose dressing like umami & crispy fried quail which turned out bland. Waitstaff were friendly & there is an extensive cocktail list. Restaurant is ok but needs to up its game in the face of competitors in the neighborhood.
5
I have just finished dining at Ding Dong and let me tell you the food was divine! The restaurant itself had a cool hip happening vibe to it...The Asian fusion dishes does not disappoint the palette!We shared the following dishes for a table of four:- Edamame with Singapore curry mousse- Crispy pig ears with sichuan pepper & lime- Asian wagyu beef tartare with homemade chilli sauce & pickled vegetables- Iberico pork bao w smoked hoisin cucumber & crispy shallots- Scallop ceviche with fresh coconut and chinese cabbage- Red curry wagyu short rib with green mango slawDesserts - Ding Dong√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s frozen bibimbap- Malacca cendol 2013- Mango sticky rice w coconutThis place is great to go out with a group of friends and share a meal and the surrounding area has trendy bars to go out to afterwards.In all honesty this is one of the reasons why I love Singapore so much, for places like this
3
The hostess offered us either a high table, which I don't like, or a low table in a hallway with a view of an alleyway that was not very appetizing. We ordered two overpriced cocktails before having the "Feed Me" menu. When the brought edamame for the first course I thought it was a joke. The food was bland and seemed like it was shooting too high
3
Despite the drinks menu having something like x36 wines, x10 sparkling wines, x15 different cocktails....there is pretty much zero choice on soft-drinks."Organic cola", or "organic lemonade" (made with freshly-squeezed lemons/limes) were offered. My wife asked if there were any fruit juices. Nothing available. Spotted one of the cocktails had pineapple juice in it as an ingredient. "Could I just have a pineapple juice?", "No, sorry, you can have a mocktail instead if you want?". "Um, any sparkling water?". "Nope". "Ah, look, don't worry, we'll just have tap water, thanks".Very strange. Not least because our table had a pregnant woman, a child of six years old, and several people who had early meetings the next day and frankly didn't want to drink booze on a week-night.Please Ding Dong, give a little thought to expanding the choice...
4
I have been to Ding Dong a few times now, and it never disappoints. The cocktails are great, and there is a good variety of food with different flavours that you won't always experience outside of SE Asia. There are also a few fish options for those that don't eat meat. It is a fun place for a meal and in a good part of Singapore for drinks afterwards
4
I was here alone and went for the feed me menu, $56, perfect amount of food, fresh, tasty and beautifully presented. Fantastic cocktails but quite pricey, even for the area.
4
This is a cool place just write for an informal business lunch. Ambience, interiors and service is excellent. Food is wonderful, different and very tasty. They do an excellent lunch menu for 3 courses and wine for a great value $35.
Highly recommended.
5
We had dinner ◊¥feed me" menue. The food was very tasty, oriental fusion. We dis not take the desert with the feed me menue and the waiter recommended a deliceous desert with ice cream and pop corn which was excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant
3
Serving of the Pork Belly is so small so I ordered another food to fill my hungry stomach. Try the Gula Malacca with Sagu, Pudding & coconut for dessert :)
4
For two people we had 1 cold, 2 hot small plates and 2 entrees which was the perfect amount. We also had a dessert but that probably wasn't needed, I definitely left full! The scotch eggs were amazing as was the Vietnamese salad and I definitely recommend. The whole restaurant had a very cool vibe. Bartenders/staff were young and friendly. Cocktail menu had a lot of interesting options with varying liquor choices. I think the only negative was the bar stool seating. After a long meal my back was craving more support. Maybe this keeps the diners moving? Overall a fun place, especially for couples or groups of friends
5
Dining with our two teenage children, the whole atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and inviting. The food was truly spectacular having 3 cold starters, all amazing especially the scallop ceviche. 4 warm starters and 2 large mains. This was just the right amount which was suggested by our waitress. The menu is not overbearing and although I had no room for desert, I did have a spoonful of my daughters mango sticky rice, which again was delightful. We tried a few cocktails and again each one was delicious. The staff are all efficient and well presented and I do like being able to see a working kitchen, situated on the ground floor entrance. Well done and thank you for great food and service

I have always been a fan of Asian fusion. The problem here is one of focus and positioning, although i can see effort being made. In my opinion, the decor and staff was quite modern and progressive in today's context - fun yet not ballistic or contrived, similar to the array of food in the menu. However, this concept was at odds with the price and serving size which was more akin to fine dining restaurants. Furthermore, not all the dishes were consistently of a certain quality and "oomph" which would have been more befitting. Some elements of the dishes were more decorative than contributive to taste which speaks of superficiality. Yet some dishes, like the Scotch eggs and Edamame with curry mousse was definitely unique, fun and tasty. Some were hits and some were misses, although expectations are high given the perceived branding they have projected. Whatever the case, kudos to the culinary and conceptual courage
4
I've been here twice now, once as a couple and once in a group. Both times were for lunches that ended up being a wee bit longer than the average......Each time the staff were very accomodating and friendly.The best way to sample the menu is to order the small plates - lots of bite sized nibbles. Though in the higher price range, the food is still good value for money (caveat here - it is Singapore, after all). Fabulous flavours, textures, presentation and frankly, I'd go back again and again just for the scotch quail eggs - luscious
3
Ding Dong offers what I'd call average and heavily westernized Asian fusion cuisine. Some of their dishes are quite nice, but none really offer the flavors or spices you'd expect - it all seems to be lacking in "bite" and energy. The place should be great for cocktails though, as it has a nice, cool vibe to it. All in all a good restaurant for a quick bite, but nothing to write home about..
5
This fusian restaurant has a great menu and tasty cocktails to go with. Everything we ordered was very nice with the exception if the barramundi main which could have had some more flavour.An all round great dining experience that's not too expensive. As a couple we sat on a high table next to the bar which was ok, the service was nothing short of 5 star which is hard to find in Singapore
2
The wait staff gave us dirty look when we decided to stop at one bottle of wine. Service was poor.
The restaurant is also very loud. It was hard to hear ourselves even the restaurant was not full.
2
Food was ok, and service fine. But pay attention to the prices. This was the least value for money I have ever experienced, especially on alcohol (living in SG). Do not go here! Plenty of good places next door.
5
Always like visiting this place. The food is excellent, the staff know their stuff and the cocktails r great. What more can you ask for?!
4
I have visited this restaurant twice, firstly as part of a group and then as a party of 3. The service and food have been very good. Staff are well informed and are able to make recommendations depending on your need for the evening. The cocktails are also rather yummy. The food is different in terms of the various Asian blends. Influence mainly japanese, but with a touch of indian, thai, etc. Really like it. The only negative for me are the acoustics in the room. The noise becomes annoying very quickly as you can't hear each other and it is more the hollow sound created by other voices in the room. It feels like you are sitting in a tunnel. Unfortunately, one feels the need to leave sooner rather than later which is a shame
3
I had heard a lot about this place so had high hopes. The first time I went, I called ahead and they told me that they took the last order at 10:30 pm. I arrived at about 10:15 pm and the cooks had already left! Very disappointing.I returned a few nights later for dinner. The cocktail I had was interesting, and the food was decent but not amazing and overpriced for what it was.I don't really get why this place is so popular
5
I discovered this place a couple of months ago when my friend held her birthday meal here. I have returned twice since and this is now my place to take visitors for a slightly different, informal yet special, delicious meal (any excuse to go back!) I'm working my way through the asian fusion menu and so far everything I've sampled has been fantastic. Favourites have to be the Vietnamese chicken coleslaw, deconstructed pork boa (the lobster version is also very good), the incredibly moreish carbon wrapped prawns and the beef rendang. Cocktails and the Austrian wine carafes also good to wash it all down. The dishes are small so you need to order a few- for 2 people you'll need around 6 dishes to get a good selection of flavors and feel satisfied, maybe more if you're really hungry! So the price can add up a bit- but well worth it! The staff have been great every visit, highly attentive but non- intrusive. I do agree with the review that said the chairs aren't the most comfortable, many are stools set with high tables - but on the other hand this works with the ambience of the place which is relaxed and fun. I will certainly continue to return again and again
3
A nice restaurant,buzzy and full.The food was different and quite creative but expensive.The service was poor and we had to wait a long time for our food.The chairs are very uncomfortable and I wished I did not have to sit on them for so long.It is advisable to book otherwise you may have to sit at the bar to eat
4
At the end of a lovely holiday visit to our son and his family they took us to Ding, Dong for a mealit was very different we were offered a selection of dishes in case we didn't know what to order, but we stuck with one dish chosen by each of us that we fancied tasting with the aim of sampling each others. We were pleased with our choices, duck dumplings were delish! they were all tasty and looked delicious. The mains equally so, the portion size was good and we all agreed that the flavours were excellent.The reastaranut decor was n't much to mention but the food said it all. No room for puds but an extra spoon to have a spoon full of a shared dish was all that was needed. Super
4
Took my in-laws tonight and we all enjoyed our meal. We shared 4 starters and 4 mains and all were delicious. Highlights were the duck dumplings in consomme, minced pork pancakes and beef rendang. Service was super and only minor complaint was that their air con wasn't working properly but with the constant flow of iced water, we didn't mind at all. Oh and the singing chefs were highly amusing and very friendly. Will be returning very soon
5
Enjoyed the creative combination of drinks, food and dessert. Loved the Scallop Ceviche, Soft Shell crab starters. The wagyu curry and rendang were extremely tasty with the burst of flavors. And the desserts were just super! Frozen Bibimbap is a work of art to look at and the masterful combination makes this my favorite! The Chendol was also very good. Enjoy
5
This is a great place to go with friends. The atmosphere is casual but the service is nevertheless excellent. We tried a few dishes and all of them were really well prepared both for the eye and the month. I will come back.
4
Went for the set lunch and it was delicious. Chinese dishes with a modern twist.
3 dishes and wine for $35 was great value.
Attentive and friendly service.

Have been looking for good fusion food here in Singapore, and I have found it! We were a party of four discerning foodies and were delighted with our meal. We decided - having done some mental arithmetic - that we would be better off choosing a la carte: we got more dishes for less money that either of the two set menus on offer, and we could choose what we wanted. So this is what we had: wagyu beef tartare, the pork belly, the soft shell crab, the lamb ribs, beef shank in red curry, the grilled fish wing, scallops, the spring roll - wrapped in Chinese cabbage, the tofu, charcoal prawn tempura and three desserts including the signature dessert which was delicious (I have not included all the detailed menu descriptions!). The only time we thought the food bland was the wagyu beef tartare, otherwise everything else was fantastic. We were helped by the delightful Australian maitre d', which included swapping restaurant recommendations in Bangkok. A real foodie! This is the best meal I have had in Singapore in 18 months...next we are trying The Tippling Club, the mothership! as far as value is concerned, I think this represents good value for fine dining - the top-rated restaurants are charing tasting menus of $150-200 plus,so for food c $50 per head is a good deal. As for the decor - well OK, I suppose, very modern, bad acoustics, and not sure I like the high stools we were seated on! but in Club Street area, so buzzy atmosphere
5
My colleague chose this restaurant based on the reviews and it didn't disappoint. We were greeted straight away and shown to a table by a very friendly waiter and we chose the tasting menu - we asked if we could choose special dishes and that wasn't an issue. I actually wanted to try the 'crispy pig ear' and soft shell crab and the Chef was fine with that. Everything was really, really well prepared and different to anything I had eaten before - that's something I tend to look for when in a different country, after all, why fly a long way from home and eat the same boring things you would eat at home?Service was pretty good - the waiter did forget my colleague's beer so we had to ask again for it, but in general, the service was good and I'd certainly reccomend trying it. The whole area that Ding Dong is in, has a really nice night vibe and you feel quite safe there, so if you're a woman on your own, or a woman travelling with female friends / colleagues, I'd certainly suggest you try this restaurant - we walked back to our hotel from Ding Dong through China Town and it was really nice and felt totally safe at 10:30p
5
I love this place- I'd describe it as modern SE Asian food. The Vietnamese coleslaw, the pig ears, the chendol, the red curry beef- I can't stop thinking about how delicious they all are..plus the other dishes. Also the cocktails are AhMayZing! One of my favorites place to eat
5
Well done Ryan Clift, this is such a find! And would expect nothing less from you! Stunning! Food, drinks, the staff, the setting, it super good! We ordered everything on the small bites menu and had a good go at the cocktails. Top Fav's - the spicy pumpkin, prawn and coconut veloute, Scallop ceviche with fresh coconut and chinese cabbage, tom kha crispy quail and Roasted duck dumpling, shitake mushroom w duck consomm√É¬©! Will def be going back there again... and again... and again
4
This was our first visit to Ding Dong on the recommendation of a friend. Having reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to book given the comments on over pricing and food quality. First impression in entering and being led up two floors was this place has a nice ambience. Our party of 3 were led to a good sized table for 4 and our only complaint here is that the red park bench style seats were very hard and uncomfortable for my wife. Providing some cushions to sit on if requested would be good. The cocktails we started with were all made and well presented. Not particularly large but I prefer quality over quantity and the quality was above average for cocktails in Singapore. Where Ding Dong excelled for us was on the high quality food and unusual Asian tapas combined with very good and attentive service. We also had a very nice bottle of Barolo and deserts and the bill came to about $120 each which I thought was pretty good considering we had cocktails, wine , 6 tapas dishes and deserts. Will definitely go back but maybe bring our own cushions this time ! Oh and one other thing ... There was no bread available which I had expected but then again this is not Spanish style tapas
5
My wife brought me to Ding Dong to celebrate my birthday and it was one of the most gastronomically-interesting, tastebud-sensory overloading culinary experience I have ever had.The cuisine is a cheeky interpretation of Asian-Western fusion fare, helmed by the genius of Ryan Clift of the Tippling Club.We had the Vietnamese Scotch Eggs, Kingfisher sashimi with Yuzu dressing, 5 Spiced Lamb Ribs, and Carbon Charred Red Curry Marinated Sole Fish. It was an explosion of flavours and texture! Each ingredient was there for a reason - to tease, tantalise, cajole, even confuse your tastebuds. But you know what, it worked!And to finish the meal off we had their now-famous dessert - Melaka Chendol with corn ice cream, gula melaka jelly, salted pop corn drizzled with Gula Melaka and coconut cream. Again, it sounds like a disaster waiting to brew in the stomach, but yet again, it worked. Sweet, sour, salty, crunchy, gooey - brilliant!It would have been great if the wait staff was better though. They were too aloof and inattentive for my liking. But oh well, the dessert made up for that
2
had dinner here with some expat friends who had been before and recommended. Cant say it was a thrilling dinner (apart from the company)..cost SGD600+ for 4 to be propped up on bar stools for the night and served what i consider tapas. We had the set menu which was ok but not really to my taste, especially the pigs ear which is what we give our dog. Kind of gross. I was violently ill all night and the next morning after eating here...so whilst i cant entirely say it was the restaurant as i was travelling in a foreign country, i sort of feel that it was as I started feeling yukky as soon as we left. Not a nice way to feel when embarking on an international flight. I can see why this kind of restaurant is popular, its pretty cool and the staff were nice..it just wasnt my thing
5
I've been here a few times now and have always chosen the tasting menu, and are never disappointed. Seating a bit tight and the smallish tables can get crowded with your meal plus water and cocktail glasses but this is a small issue. Great location in Ann Siang Hill, close to many bars
3
I spent an evening in Singapore two weeks ago and I asked a friend who lives there for some ‚Äúspecial Asian‚Äù food ‚Äì as the city is without a doubt more than well-endowed food-wise. She selected Ding Dong. On three levels, with the open-kitchen downstairs, we sat on the mid-level on a small table next to the bar. It took them forever to come to our table for orders ‚Äì and they did not seem that busy. We ended up ordering only starters. The Edamame with curry mousse was awkward. I did not really know how to eat it. In the end, I cleaned the beans and mixed them all in the curry mousse ‚Äì a rather laborious exercise. The mousse was, nevertheless, tasty. We also had the soft shelled crab which was crispy and spicy. I really do not remember what else we had, so it could not have been too memorable (I only had three 4-oz - glasses of white wine, so this could not have been the reason). All in all a bit of a disappointment, and it was not the best value, as the bill was hefty
4
Service was superb, which made the night really enjoyable. The dining space we had on the 2nd level was comfortable for 2 persons. Food-wise, the we enjoyed the roasted black miso kingfish wing the most...and also found the crispy pig ears an interesting item. We also had the scallop cevinche and roasted duck dumplings which good, but not fantastic. Overall, a great meal for me
5
We went for the feed me option (chefs choice). All I can is that chef made amazing choices. Squid, lamb salted ribs, kingfish, fish curry and the best one was chicken breast slaw. Amazing. So fresh, such interesting combinations of flavours. Light meals perfect for sharing and for Singapore. Will be back!
4
Very enjoyable evening of great food and good wine.The cocktails were less than stellar, not particularly interesting and not served in a quantity that would leave a cocktail drinker satisfied.The Vietnamese Scotch Eggs were a riot.Spicy beef salad with fragrant herbs which was lovelyThe Smoked pork bao with hoisin, cucumber and crispy shallots were equally good.Tom kha crispy quail was crispy as promised with a delicious curry sauce.Desserts were difficult to decide as so much sounded appetising.The Ananas Siang Hill and Crema Singapura both won the day and were delicious.The bill of 530$ for 4 was reasonable considering we had cocktails, a bottle of vino verde and a bottle of prosseco for dessert.So do go but you can leave the cocktails to some other distinguished establishments in the area

One of my foodie work colleagues booked this for a small group of us, having researched the latest, greatest and coolest spots in town. Ding Dong is located on Ann Siang Road, one of the trendy hotspots on the Singapore dining scene (really just a grubby, dilapidated agglomeration of recently mouldy shophouses), however it‚Äôs trying too hard to fit in. My first impression of the restaurant ‚Äì at the top of a set of stairs on the second floor ‚Äì is that it looked spartan, uncomfortable and overlit. Metal framed school chairs and rickety tables are not cool ‚Äì they are just uncomfortable, and the odd bit of neon wall art doesn‚Äôt compensate for that. And as it turned out, neither did anything else‚Ä¶We ordered cocktails to start, which were O.K - my Ca Phe Sua Da #2 was novel in that it was served in a traditional Vietnamese coffee urn, but despite possessing Vietnamese coffee, VSOP cognac, Amaro, and agave nectar, it was actually pretty bland. Other drinks were similarly lacklustre. We ordered a series of starters and mains from the ala carte menu, having elected not to go for the ‚ÄòFeed Us‚Äô (aka trust the chef) option. I didn‚Äôt understand the ‚ÄòFeed Us‚Äô concept as the combinations are random collections of the same dishes that are on the ala carte menu - so why restrict yourself to a set selection (at what appeared to be little or no discount) instead of ordering what you want from the menu? Weird‚Ä¶In any case, the food is hit and miss. Highlights were the 48 hr beef cheek rendang and red curry Wagyu short rib, which were both excellent. The five spice lamb ribs were tasty but bony and lacking meat, crab and pork wontons fall into the category of ‚Äòvery good‚Äô, but the Wagyu rice paper rolls should be renamed ‚Äòcarrot rolls‚Äô (where‚Äôs the beef?), and the garlic and pepper squid were small and shreddy and mostly batter. Because the portions are small and the prices high, this only adds to the mild dissatisfaction. And although I‚Äôve enjoyed sister restaurant Open Door Policy a couple of times (where the food is consistently better), I‚Äôve always felt mildly robbed afterwards ‚Äì as I did here

Several months ago The New York Times did a review of a few restaurants on this new, chic street in Singapore. A Singaporean friend and I decided to give Ding Dong a try. After reading a few of the reviews, I wasn't sure we would have a good experience. We were very pleased that from beginning to end, it was a perfect meal and experience. The wait staff could not have been nicer. The appetizers and entrees (we shared everything) were excellent. Well prepared and great presentation. I can say without hesitation that the Beef Cheek Rendang could not have been prepared better. The meat just fell apart. The Barramundi was cooked to perfection. And all of the sauces were very flavorful.I can say that we had thought of trying the chef's sampler but after reading one reviewer's comments that they had 4 out of 5 fried dishes, we chose to select items from the menu...dishes that were not fried
3
On our quest to find interesting cocktail places, we ended up in Ding Dong. It's a cosy shophouse that has oriental decor, like a coffee shop feel. The menu offers us several interesting pick so we ordered two of each section.The first 2 cocktails, Golden Mile and Fujiyama was good. What followed next was the appetisers. The Scallop ceviche and Kingfish sashimi tasted wonderful and the side ingredient and sauces were very tasty but the seasoning seems to be overpowering the main ingredient that we felt that maybe leaving the main ingredient out makes no difference to the dish.The next 2 dishes we had was Vietnames scotched eggs and Smoked pork bao. The yolks of the eggs has largely leaked away from the preparation. The smoked pork was surprisingly tender and tasty. It's good but not something to wow about.The main dish of crispy quail was a disappointment as it taste just like fried chicken. I prefer KFC anytime. The slow cooked beef cheek rendang deserves our recommendation though. It was melt in the mouth tender and the sauce was well done.The ultimate gimmick was the Malacca chendol... the presentation was fantastic but taste wise, not impressive. Just put popcorn with ice cream and throw in some jelly. We could not taste malacca.Overall we felt that the dinner was over priced for it's quality. We spent about $250 for all the above and that could buy us better much food elsewhere. The chef is really good with sauces but they just outshine the main ingredient
5
This place opened around the same time as loads of other new restaurants and so was completely overlooked as another overly fancy, pretentious expensive small plate concept. How wrong could I be? very. The service was really friendly, every waiter was informed and did not need to check with someone else every time you asked a question and pretty timely. Not too fast not too slow. The food is really tasty and most importantly is priced correctly so you don't walk out hungry after spending a small fortune. The portions for the small plates are not canape sized like in many of the restaurants that have this concept and can be shared, the larger plates are either one main meal or with a few small plates can also be shared. All in all, really great

Was working in Singaopre and popped in here for lunch - a friend had recommended. Did not disappoint. Both for the food and the service. Chose three dishes - the first a pumpkin, coconut and prawn veloute (or soup!), was absolutely delicious - I would go back just to have this. The thai beef salad and garlic pepper squid were also very good - the dressings and sauces had a good 'zing' to them, the meat was tasty and squid fresh. I wanted to go online, and asked about wifi. Was told there was wifi available, but it might not be working. Which it wasn't when i checked. But the waiter came back to see if I'd been successful, and when i said not, he offered to leave his iPhone nearby, and create a 'hotspot' so I could access the internet via his phone. Really helpful. In fact all the staff were friendly and smiley - not always the case in Singapore! They do a set menu which was good value

My partner and I went to Ding Dong on a Wednesday night and had an amazing time! We had the 'feed us' menu which included 2 cold dishes, 3 warm dishes and 2 main sized dishes plus rice accompaniment. (We opted against the menu which included dessert which was a wise decision -we were so full by the end!) location and fit out was tops, modern and functional. Couldn't fault the food at all-good techniques, great flavour combinations and a great mix of dishes. The price was standard western Singaporean prices! Being from Melbourne, cocktails were probably cheaper and food equally priced at an equivalent restaurant in Melbourne. The service was fine-not intrusive but tables were cleared promptly when completed. The previous comments don't give justice to the venue, rather sounds like people with ludicrous expectations and just going to find faults rather than enjoy themselves! Super cool, trendy joint with a great atmosphere and food to match.

A little apprehensive of going as trip advisor reviews were generally poor, although friends had highly recommended and rating was high in a Singapore food reviewer website. Was not disappointed, highlights were the cocktails, the carbon battered sole and the delicious beef rendang. Will return!

Not a good experience. Food is hit and miss. A few great dishes, most average but below par given the price. Service is friendly but poor. Don't seemed to have training.

Cold appetizers are great here such as chicken lettuce wraps. Easy for a quick weekday bite or a fun place for a group going out on a weekend.

I am a big fan of modern twist on Asian food. The menu looked interesting and indeed the food tasted good. We ordered the "feed us" menu which is chefs choice on the night. As a couple we had six small plates delivered to the table including one bowl of rice. 4 of the dishes were deep fried and the remaining dish Vietnamese chicken salad. In my opinion we got very little of the fresh flavours of Asia and felt very heavy after eating so much fried food. After a restless nights sleep ( never a good sign ) we both woke up with that intense flavour in the mouth. Wine list was also expensive and in my opinion not in-line with the food, d√É¬©cor, nor the mood of the restaurant. The service was friendly and attentive but this isnt a restaurant I'll choose to visit again

I'm a fan of both Tippling Club and Open Door Policy, so was curious to check out Ding Dong from the same group. I had high expectations but left feeling disappointed and ripped off. To start with the positive, the decor of the establishment is cool and modern in a multi-level shop house. The positive pretty much stops there. We went for the 'Feed Me' option, which basically leaves it up to the chef to choose what to serve you. All we got were just OK, not that great. I kept hoping to be 'wowed' with the next dish but that 'wow' moment never came. To top it off, I was not impressed when the waiter came to clear our tables and promptly asked us to leave even when I was in the middle of my drink (and had only been there for 1 hour). To be honest, I don't really think an overpriced Asian fusion style restaurant can really take off in Singapore, since the standard for Asian food is so high and price pretty low. Better off moving Ding Dong to London or NYC. Bottom line: I was totally underwhelmed

We went as party of four adults and two children at 7pm on a Saturday night. We were informed by the wait staff that the draft wine was unavailable, which is odd for a busy night. We ordered a number of cold and small/large plates and were later told that the pork belly had "run out" even though there was only one other table of three seated before us! The food is ok but nothing stands out and definitely not good value for money. There are many other places to go to for a better meal in Singapore. Another low light was that they served the king fish sashimi without key ingredients and it was only after we highlighted this that we were informed that the chef had forgotten to provide them. The waygu beef rice paper rolls were lacking beef and were full of raw carrot and flavor. I actually recommend this place to my guests because of Ryan clift's association - major fail! Also, the wait staff need further training on how to deal with complaints

Lets start with the good points:* food was (on the whole) pretty good - and certainly a bit "different" in the way that they put dishes together. * the cocktails were nice (but were very small, especially for S$18) * although there was nothing vegetarian on the menu, they catered for it brilliantly* it has been really well fitted outAnd the bad points:* it is EXPENSIVE! * service wasn't great - we asked different staff how many dishes they thought we should order, and got very different (and very confusing!) answers* as mentioned, cocktails were small (but tasty)* we had a loud table next to us, but as they don't have any soft furnishings the noise was too much.

We did the feed me option so we did not have to choose our small plates $73 for all you can eat including dessert per person. Food was good but not great. Service was very good and I loved the decor. Superb location, many places to stop for a night cap afterwards

For a more in depth review and pics, please visit my blog at: http://www.treatsandmeats.com/blog/dingdongI've always felt that there was a lack of trendy restaurants in Singapore serving up good Asian fare as well as great cocktails. That is, anyway, until Ding Dong came along. It's conveniently located along Ann Siang Hill (great for people who want to continue boozing after) and has a bright, colorful, playful interior. The menu boasts a "small plates" and "big plates" section which is perfect for those who like to order a few dishes and share. We started off dinner with the Vietnamese scotch eggs (a hard boiled egg, wrapped in sausage meat & breadcrumbs then baked! Yum!) which was a hit. The yolk was nice and gooey, while the meat was juicy and slightly crisp on the outside. I was also a fan of the calamari which was perfectly battered. The dark soy pork belly with garlic was another hit, though beware it is incredibly garlicky and probably should be avoided on first dates! Don't waste your stomach space on the lamb ribs as they were pretty gamey. As for the drinks, they were tasty & refreshing. Definitely get the Pegu Club if you want something that packs a punch

This is not a venue for a quiet romantic date. The restaurant is buzzing with enthusiastic waiting staff eager to please. We were sat next to the bar which at times meant we couldn't hear each other over the vigorous cocktail shaking, but that was fine as the food did most of the talking! We ordered a few of the plates including the five spice lamb ribs, I found them a little fatty for my taste but my husband found his very lean so I guess it was just luck of the draw. The carbon battered lemon sole was good but needed some lime (provided) adding to the mayo as it was a little timid. The red curry wagu short ribs were delicious and the waiter apparently tried to clear the place on several occasions whilst I was licking the last bits of sauce from my fingers. The sambal rice was a good accompaniment to the dishes. Generally not being a fan of Asian deserts we were encouraged to order the Malacca chendol which the restaurant are obviously proud of - it was even served by someone from Malacca. I would normally hate the combination of ingredients but they worked incredibly well and it was a talking point of the evening. We'll definitely return to try more dishes from the menu, but might find an excuse to stick to the chendol
