My family has eaten at Tomoe for close to 10 years now. They have consistently delivered good quality Japanese food at very reasonable prices. While this isn't a Michelin-star eatery, the food is extremely good quality for the price one pays. Highly recommended.

My family has been eating here for years.The food is all reasonably priced and of great quality and taste, so it is extremely value for money. Dinner tends to be more expensive than lunch, so my family usually goes at lunchtime for their lunch sets. Some of our favourites are the Beef yakiniku set, Mixed teppan set and Tempura with cold soba set (I forgot the name of this last one). The appetisers and side dishes are good as well. I recommend the jellyfish, soft shell crab, and salmon skin, all of which I find are way better (and cheaper) than a lot of other places. Food is also of very consistent quality. It's never very crowded so you can probably choose wherever you want to sit if you go at the right times, and the place is pretty quiet and has a good ambience. The people are really lovely, friendly and helpful too. The one difficulty eating here is probably getting parking space, but other than that this is definitely one of my favourite Japanese restaurants

Tucked in a row of shophouses behind a massive MRT contruction site opposite the Holy Spirit Church at Upper Thomson Road is this small but very cosy Japanese Food eatery run by a friendly and neighbourly local couple. The menu is varied and the food is authentic and value-for-money. It was a good quiet place for a business lunch and the food prepared was very tasty and up to the standard expected of Japanese cuisine. I will return to sample the other offerings on the menu. Highly recommended if you crave for a Japanese meal at reasonable prices.

We had bento set the food was not too bad, there is a small crowd price reasonable serving normal.If for any reason family decide not to cook this a good place to settle a meal
