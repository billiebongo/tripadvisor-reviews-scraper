Not my first time but first in Singapore . Located in Chimes , tube city Hall next to Raffles. Wonderful flavoursome dishes but pricy compare to other places we can eat all other Singapore . Worth a visit saying that .

we come here every year and it never lets us down. expensive, yes but everywhere in sing is.we try all the restaurants in chijmes, but we always come back here. time it right and you could be in the happy hour,1-1.

We went for lunch. It's a great setting outside by the church. The food was excellent. We really enjoyed Cambodian style seafood curry. Mild, creamy, fresh seafood with great scallops, prawns, fish and big mussels. Really good food. For Singapore service was good. Loved it.

We went for dinner -The food pictures on the menu looked very appetising , but unfortunately it was very bland. The cocktails were very weak & tasted mainly of ice-the alcohol in the drinks could not be tasted-expensive for what it is.The location is great -very lively in the evening -staff were friendly and helpful

The IndoChine group operates a chain of bars, restaurants, clubs, villas and resorts in the region. This particular place is a restaurant serving food from the Indochina region: Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia. For this reason alone, this place is worth at least a visit. Most of the dishes are good for sharing between at least 4 persons. I liked the following:IndoChine platterRice paper handrolled with poached tiger prawnSignature Seafood & chicken crispy spring rollsCrispy lychee prawn beignetsCharred sugarcane prawn quenellesTruffle friesHandpounded green papaya saladPomelo & tiger prawn saladIndoChine Tom yam soupRagoutLamb shankRoast duck in green currySteamed sea bassChef’s special grilled tiger prawnCambodian Seafood in coconut curryAustralian asparagusPan fried tofuSticky riceAll the desert were goodPrices a bit on the high side.Place is just next to Raffles City, where there is City Hall MRT station. You can redeem parking. Please check During the day, it is good to sit in the aircon section. At night, it is good to sit in the open.

IndoChine Chijmes This restaurant is located in the Chijmes and offers both indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating provides nice views over the central Chijmes square. They offer a variety of tapas style Asian dishes and I found the services to be both prompt and friendly. I'd definitely recommend the fried chicken spring rolls!

If you are into food at all then this will disappoint. After many trips to Singapore this was the worst food I have ever had to pay for. Dry, bland, lacking freshness, and lacking the traditional Vietnamese flavours of Coriander, Mint, and Nuoc Cham fish sauce. Can’t believe anyone could rate this food as acceptable at any level
2
Does not live up to its lovely setting.Plastic ferns on the trellis overhead set the tone for a generic experience.Western pop music playing too loud. The waiter kindly turned it down.Red wine served at tropical temperature ie 28 centigrade. Food was pretty forgettable. Mediocre lamb shank.
1
Entered, sat down, took our own menu, waited. Nothing. Went up to the bar area, no one, one popped up, ordered, waited. Waited, staff came back, not available. Chose another, waited. Not cold enough for a white. Bottle was kept on top of ice, instead of into an ice bucket. A few couples walked in, sat down and walked away, as there was no attention. So lost! No way we are coming back. Lack of staff or a leader?

This is a great spot to unwind after a hard days shopping. Siting in the alfresco, surrounded by classic architecture and an inner courtyard that blankets the noise of traffic you could be anywhere but the middle of a manic city. The service was very professional and quick, the food (yes, with pictures which always makes me nervous) was well prepared though not very sophisticated. A good flavour of Asia, especially if you are not that brave and want a clean, friendly and quiet setting... now I am starting to sound like an old man...

We were recommended Indo Chine but must say it was just OK. Nothing specular but nothing wrong with the food or service. Wonderful location and setting particularly if you have kids. But certainly not amazing.
5
Stopped in here for a short break from shopping. Singapore Sling accompanied by Fresh vietamese spring rolls. Delicious and well priced.
Whilst sitting in comfortable relaxing seats admiring the plants and ferns. Friendly and helpful staff.

Had lunch here. Food was quite good. Nice atmosphere.. Service acceptable.
The guy that appeared to be the manager was quite humorless and lacked any kind of personality.

It was a little warm outside but we didn’t want to miss out on the experience of eating outside and watching all the people go by.Great little restaurant in the CHIJMES complex, downstairs in the courtyard.Good food although the service was a little slow.They also did 2 for 1 glasses of wine which helps with Singapore prices and the ++ tax.Definitely worth a try but next visit we’ll have to try the one up in the Supertree’s at Gardens by the Bay

First time dining here after reading several reviews. Interesting mix of Western, Vietnamese and Thai cuisine. Service staff were friendly. We tried the steak on offer which was good value but the waiter did ask how we like it to be done. Rating for staeak: 6/10. The lamb shank was good and enough to serve 4. We also order a stir-fried vegetable and some starters. The steam fish looks good too. Probably be back another day

We chose this restaurant following some good publicity and some good write ups but were very, very disappointed. When I dine with my wife, especially at higher priced establishments, I expect to eat our meals together, and not 15 minutes apart. My wife rice came out on time, but by the time her meal arrived, it was cold and had to be replaced. We followed up whereabouts of her meal a couple of time only to be told its coming. We decided to leave and when we started getting up, they realised we were serious and very quickly got my wife meal to her. However, we should have left because it was terrible. My Ragout was nice, but nothing special, just like many goulashes I have had in the past, but it was tasty. My wife tiger prawn dish had 6 prawns in a bowl filled with onions and a very oily sauce. Sorry shouldn't call it a sauce because it wasn't, it was majority oil. The fellow on the table next to us had a steak, but only ate a small portion before he got up and left, without paying. We did the right thing and paid. The manage when told about our disappointment with the meal and service was very apologetic and gave us his card asking us to contact him personally when next visiting and he would make sure we received better service. A discount would have been more appreciated but this was not forthcoming. I told him we didn't want his card because we would never come back, but he insisted on us taking discard anyway. We threw it in the next bin we came across. It was very disappointing because the Chimes is a lovely place to visit and has a great atmosphere, but the Indo Chine is one place to definitely avoid

Indochine has been one of our favourite joints in Chjimes - but during our last visit we witnessed extremely poor customer service. We had primarily gone there for drinks and ordered Macallan 12 years and ended up ordering 8 pegs in all. At the end when we received the bill - we were charged for Macallan 18 years with an excessive billing of around sgd 85. We kept telling the restaurant that we had clearly ordered Macallan 12 only - but the manager kept on insisting that our order was for Macallan 18. After a lot of debate, the manager gave us a discount of sgd30 on a bill of sgd 540. He kept on insisting that he trusts his staff and refused to acknowledge that they may have made a mistake. So much in the name of customer orientation - and that too, after we had spent around sgd5000 at a party at this place last year. Would not like to visit again till the same manager is still around.

I really enjoyed my meal IndoChine @ CHIJMES. I was visiting Chijmes during the lunch hour and Indochine had air con and a lunch special - salad, main dish, and a soda for $13SGP - amazing price!! I ordered the green papaya salad - DELICIOUS, for main I had the pork with vermicelli - not very authentic Vietnamese vermicelli but still very tasty. The food was really good and very attentive staff

Just went to indochine at chijmes for late dinner and drinks with some girlfriends. We had a great time with good food and drinks and was just having a chat when the waiters started clearing our tables from 11pm. They did ask for last orders and brought our bill before that but we had drinks not done at that point. They were clearing tables slowly, which was fine initially... then somewhere about 1135pm, the waiters were clearing the table candlelights and napkins from our table. When i politely asked the waiter what time they were closing, he said 12am. We thought thats fine and we could leave in 10mins or so. In the very next minute, the manager himself came over and asked us if he could keep the cushions we were sitting on! That is practically telling us to leave! When i commented on that, he could still say, "no i am not asking you to leave. You could still stay but i just need to keep the cushions." How rude of the guy! I asked what time they were closing and now he says 1145. I just checked the website and it says open till 1am! With such horrible service, i do not recpmmend for you to come here in case you will be sitting on hard rattan chairs with no cushions in the future. Not a comfortable way to be having your drinks.

Nicely located restaurant within the Chimjes quadrangle/courtyard. Good service during what appeared to be a busy period. We both ordered ordered beef dishes and both were very tasty, but unfortunately the beef in both dishes was tough - not inedible - but we expected better from finest grass-raised Aussie beef. Drinks were expensive even though we took advantage of the promotion

We really enjoyed having dinner here. The Cuisine is predominantly Vietnamese but they also serve Cambodian and Laos dishes. Location in Chjimes is one of the best for seeing the architecture of the Church and Convent and for people watching.

Very enjoyable dinner. A little unsure about eating my dinner at a bar, but the service and food were very good.

A large group of us went to Indo Chine for early dinner and found good selection of tasty Thai and Chinese food. Good selection of wines, beers, and cocktails. Service was great overall and I would come back again.

We were two people who ordered for two 2 soups and spring rolls. They got us three soups instead. When we said why three soups for two the manager Sha Sha misbehaved with us and more so with a lady (my wife) and threatened by first asking us where we belong and when we said we were from India he said the I am a Malay Singaporean and don't ever mess with one. I really don't know what the hell he meant by this. Perhaps the guy needs some serious mental treatment. I will not stop here unless I get an unconditional apology from him. Period

WE booked a table outside this Saturday , for 8:30. 8:33 they called to ask of I'm on my way or they will give my table in 3 mins!!!Table was ok, and terrace is very nice but that's all, good is a shame for Vietnamese cultural cooking....except spring roll, nothing was at expected level! For those who know Vietnam pls runaway from IndochineRoland

A bit disappointed by the staff of Indochine @ Chimes, they were very friendly but erratic in level of attention. The main courses were good, no problems there. The drink was overpriced by quite a bit and the dessert choice was minimal as well as being overpriced. Considering the number of restaurants in Chijmes we made a poor choic

It was 9pm Saturday, we were looking for a bar in Chijmes to chat over Happy Hours. We searched 5 to 6 bars before we chanced upon Indo Chine, attracted by her spacious outdoor seating in a courtyard & one for one promotion. Retro/evergreens were playing in the background & every table was illuminated with a wine holder which changes colours. Great ambience.We had a quiet, relaxing time over pints & pints of cold Kronenbourg 1664 Blanc draughts. Cheers

Indochine is a delightful restaurant located in a historical building in Chijmes. They offer a nice selection of South East Asian cuisines, as well as some European dishes. They are known for their rice paper rolls and I am especially fond of their Vietnamese tiger prawn rolls.This is a restaurant that you must come with others, so as to sample a wide variety of dishes. Our group had a nice variety on the table, including Salman tartare, green papaya salad, garlic & pepper beef, grilled tiger prawns and a steamed sea bass. It was all excellent and we had very good service.The wines by-the-glass were limited, but what we had was good. The prices were not bad, and we look forward to our next meal there

On the 22/12/16 about 7pm we visited this restaurant with my family (daughter with kids and hubby visiting from Sweden). We ordered the happy hour specials of beer and wine which was one for one and the platter with fries for t eh kids. For the refill my wife requested another type of wine as the one served was not good and was rudely rejected by the manager (Dennis) and his behaviour was unacceptable as when he served the drinks and we thanked him and he rudely turned and walked away without acknowledgeing. He was just a bad brand ambassador for Indo Chine as we recommend many guest to Indo Chine being a hotelier myself. l was embarresed infront of my family for his behaviour

We expected much more of our evening, food was not as we had hoped,luckily the tiger praws were deliciousbut:PAN FRIED TOFU (DAU HU CHIEN TOI OT)(Pan fried tofu with chilli and garlic.)came "with no" sauce and have to ask specifically,FRAGRANT JASMINE RICE was just a ball of rice and certainly not as nice presented on menu!The location is beautiful and the wine was perfect, nice ice buckets
4
Our first visit and it will not be our last. The food is really good and the menu extensive. The staff were very attentive and pleasant.
5
Great deals for 1 for 1 housepour beer/wines and spirits .they also have monthly promotions to choose from wines , beers etc. Do check it out from the friendly staffs or managers for more promotions. Excellent service and great deals!
4
Good location and setting, good variety of food and drinks, satisfactory service. Recommended for hanging out for a drink !
3
Average food but not average prices. We also got cheated with the wine price so all in all not a good experience. When we complained the manager was not even willing to listen! Didn't expect this from that chain.
3
We had 4 dishes from the starters/tapas menu. They were pretty tasty but limited choices if you don't like prawns.
4
Nice courtyard location and vibe and nice outdoor tables (inside less fun). The food is pretty good, tried the sugar cane prawns, rice paper prawns and thai beef salad, all good. Have had better steamed seabass elsewhere though.
3
Popped in here this week to try the set lunch. I had the spring rolls, beef vermicelli and some iced tea. All for $14++. No problems getting a seat at lunchtime. Quite good food and reasonably fast service.
5
One of those chains that manages to look individual.Staff good. Food was fantastic. Rice paper veg spring rolls to start were fantastic. Sea Bass as a main got great reviews. And a really nice room.Chijmes is great - if you want beer and pizza. This proves it's great for real local food too.A little on the pricy side but often quality is.Recommended

We were drawn to Indo Chine at Chijmes because of the advertised oyster special at $2 per oyster and the location just across from our hotel (Carlton). Indo Chine is a beautifully decorated space with lots of mirrors and chandeliers. The oysters were from Ireland (who knew) and were good but not as good as Aussie oysters. It was the rest of our meal which was sensational; fresh, tasty and beautifully presented and prepared in a very clean open kitchen right in front of our eyes. There is an Indo Chine restaurant in the Super Tree Garden by the Bay but we ran out of time. This is on our list when next we visit Singapore.

I had a few hours prior to leaving for the airport so I asked a colleague where I could go for a quick (authentic) meal. He suggested Chijmes - firstly I was surprised at the dominance of western choices of restaurant versus anything remotely Singaporean - anyhow I chose IndoChine. I had a very light meal of Luc Lac (basically seared peppered beef) with rice and 2 x 1/2 pints of beer. The food was satisfactory. Some of the beef was tough. The bill $69 (Singaporean) about USD53. That's twice the price on any world scale for that type of meal. It was a light meal, small portion. The 2 x 1/2 pints of Kronen beer were $28 - rip off. After traveling to Singapore very regularly in the early 2000's and 1990's I find Singapore a complete rip off. LESSON - ask the locals where to eat as there are still bargains - avoid the tourist traps - they are traps
