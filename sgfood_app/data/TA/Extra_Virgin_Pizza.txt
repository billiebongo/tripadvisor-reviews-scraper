Food and service was amazing. The prosciutto and melon, and baked camembert are some of the must-tries! Loved the Pistachio Pumpkin as well.
5
Yummy pizzas. Happy hours from 6-8. Gotta try the Pork Pizza. Spaghettis are not a must, just average. Lagsane was good as well

Had not eaten pizza since leaving Europe a few months back.I was looking forward the buffala margharita. However when it came I figured out it was just regular plain mozarella and not the buffala advertised. Disappointed. So 25$ for a basic pizza was clearly not a good choice. Would not try again
3
Pretty normal pizza and quality can be much improved. But the Macaroni and Cheese was superb, worth a try
4
Pizzas here are tasty, with toppings like brocolini and sausage; pumpkin and rocket. Thin crispy crusts (but maybe a bit burnt in parts). Staff were competent but slightly haughty. A little pricey for the environment and ambience.
4
Outside eating area only which isn't my preference. Alot of human traffic for people watchers. Food was tasty, and portion sizes were fine, but pricing is on the high side. Definitely not as a regular lunch spot. Pizza and pastas going for roughly 30 per serving. Service was not without its errors but fast and friendly helped make up for it.
5
Excellent service and a nice place for some lunch time pizza. Try the Pistachio Pizza and Spicy Pepperoni.
5
Delicious Pepperoni pizza. Good service. Pleasant outdoor sitting. Advisable to make reservations during lunch time (office crowd)
4
Liked the thin crust pizza and the avocado salad. Vongole pasta was salty. The service was fast and the lady who helped us with our orders gave good recommendatio
5
Was there slightly before official opening hours. The staff who were busy setting up had no issue hosting us immediately though.Service was friendly and attentive throughout . Great recommendations by the staff. The spotted pig pizza had really generous toppings and was done to perfection. I wasn't too keen on having starters as most pizza joints have mediocre starters. EVP definitely changed my pre conceptions on that. I had the clams and it was one of the freshest I had in a while. Likewise for the meatballs. Its obviously hand made fresh. It was succulent and matching sauce just elevates it further. In short, amazing service, irresistible food and good value. It would be a shame to not to visit it at least once.

Tucked away at an easy to find and breezy corner of Asia Square.
I had the spicy pepperoni pizza which was well done and a little crispy - just the way I like it.
Very affordable for a casual biz lunch.
5
My friend's a vegan, the staff was helpful and accommodative to "tweet" the menu for my friend's diet ;)

Very much one of the best Pizzas in the CBD area, during happy hour, the beers are reasonably priced. If one had to complain is the lack of indoor seating. On muggy days, this wonderful corner of the CBD becomes a roasting pit.
5
Pizza was really tasty and made with good ingredients, but the outdoor seating was a bit too warm and not as enjoyable. They might consider expanding the area to include more indoor seating. Nevertheless, would recommend!
5
A very well located place and awesome pizzas. One of the best pesto pizza you can ever have. Reasonably priced for the location and good happy hour deals to enjoy.......................................:...................................................
5
The place and ambience was good, food was delivered within reasonable time frame. Staff was polite and knowledgeable too.
4
We went in a big group of 15 pax. However, the staff were attentive enough to take good care of us, good job!
5
The pizza was yummy and the service staff was attentive.
My friends and I enjoyed the alfresco style dining.
4
Warm and sweaty, our clothes were stuck on us upon the arrival. Slightly disappointed that only outdoor seats were left. Humid with a hint of stuffiness. I saw another diner who were improvising and using the menu to fan herself. Marvelous idea I thought. We had truffle pizza and it does have the fragrance in many of the areas. Perhaps the actual black truffle was not as impactful as the oil that was immense into the pizza.
4
We were staying at the Western and decided to try something local, we were not disappointed the Pizza was delicious and large enough for two people to share. The Capresi salad was delicious. Prices were within reason and we enjoyed eating outside. Our server Florence Foo was very helpful and explained each dish to us. We had the parma ham Pizza and the four cheese Pizza
5
Love the food, pizza base always on point and the ingredients are fresh and tasty. Besides pizza, starters like cauliflower romesco and prosciutto and melon are must-haves. And you wouldn't expect it but the music is great for hanging out to.
5
Really great pizza, generous topping, might have been a sourdough base, very tasty. i had the ham and mushroom and my partner had the pizza with the egg on it. Both very very good.
5
Came here for the TLBG fest promo, the truffle pizza was really good, service staff was also really attentive. Would come here again!
4
Great pizzas. Good vibes. Good service. Will be back for more! Hope to try truffle pizza next time. :)
5
Waiter was friendly, the pesto pistachio pizza was good! We happen to reach during happy hours and there was one for one for beers as well
1
Have had their pizzas many times, but the staff was incredibly rude on my last visit, and despite the place being empty, they were behaving as if they were doing me a favour by letting me sit and eat my lunch. Would never go back
5
Their pizza never disappoints. Favorites are the mushroom biancca and their tiramisu, which is a must try! Overall, great experience, as always.
5
Ordered a caprese salad and a bufala magherita, and both were perfect.Fresh juicy tomatoes in the caprese salad? Check. Fresh and soft buffalo mozzarella? Check. Quality balsamic vinegar? Check. This perfectly met all my demands in a caprese salad and was a delightful start to the meal.The evening got even better when I saw the pizza and the delightful charred bits in the dough. I knew I could be in for a treat. The toppings (tomato sauce, melted mozzarella, fresh basil leaves) were fresh and full of flavours, but this pizza had more to offer. This was a pizza where the crust was the star of the show. It was fragrant, with bits and small patches of char creating a different taste with each bite, and went harmoniously with the tang of the tomato sauce. The thickness was just right too, such that the flavours of the toppings were perfectly balanced with the taste and crunch of the crust.This was the best pizza I've had on this island so far
1
Had pizza there several times.I understand the staff works hard, but soo rude last time he had to give a worst review ever.Dear owner, you are in the restaurant business, and human interaction is as important as the food itself. Do filter your people. She was rude and we left
4
Had lunch at this restaurant. My experience can be summarized below:Food: Lots of pizza selection. Great taste as well!Atmosphere: Casual setting with outdoor seatings.Cleanliness: Clean.Staffs: Responsive, available and ensuring things are good.Service: Slow at times, probably because of peak lunch hours.Price: Expensive for medium size pizza (~$20 each).Final verdict:- Decent restaurant, great pizzas but pretty pricey
5
we went for a get together. food was ok. clams not taste that good. pepperooni a bit too salty. but other pizza all good
5
Pizza was great and came along with a bucket of beer as a promotion. Highly recommend the mushroom bianco and truffle pizza! Seating is all outdoors, can get quite warm if the fan is not switched on.
3
We had a prawn pizza. It was good but not as tasty as I remembered the base to be. The salad with beef was not too bad.
4
Nice place with great pizzas! Staff were attentive and friendly. But the pricing is a bit on the high side.
3
Food used to be good. Now it's just mediocre.
Pizza was so salty that we had to keep drinking water the whole afternoon.
Clam is a bit overcooked in my humble opinion.
5
The pizzas are really awesome and it was quite a quiet atmosphere for birthday celebration with my wife. It was a great experience, considering that we wanted to visit this place for the longest time.
5
One of the best Pizza's I've had in Singapore - would highly recommend it. The peperoni pizza is immense no shortage of toppings here!
5
This place gets busy during lunch as it serves the office crowd, and very peaceful and chilled-out at night. It's in an odd location as it's at the external lobby of an office building in Singapore's financial district, but easily accessible by train (you can walk from Downtown line or Marina Bay line). Their pizzas come out piping hot and very fresh - no complaints there. It is pricey - a pie is 26 bucks on average and can feed one very hungry person or two office ladies, but considered average-priced in the CBD. There are no inside seats - all seats are outside so if you're not a fan of the heat, you may not be as comfortable. Highly recommended if you're in the area and want premium ingredients in a no-fuss environment
3
I'd start by saying that the food at Extra Virgin Pizza isn't bad. However, be prepared to fork out 40-60 bucks if you wish to have a bite and a drink over lunch. Personally, with that kinda money, I'd prefer to go somewhere else for a piece of steak or some seafood rather than settle for pizza or pasta.
4
needless to say, lunch time can be crazy in singapore. service is always somehow a hit and run. however, i was pleasantly surprised with the wait staff. we managed to get a table, our menus and food served rather quickly. our water cups were refilled without us having to ask them. the pepperoni pizza is super yummy. salad was so so only. overall a pretty good place to have a quick lunch. i would return to try other stuff on their menu
3
Pizza is good and great choice but rather expensive, I guess because of location. Service is just ok.
4
Love the pizza dough. Meatball pizza is a bit of a disappointment as they used frozen meatballs instead of fresh ones.
3
Ordered four cheese pizza and pistachio pesto. Loved both!! Good service too. However, would have been great if our pizzas were served piping hot instead of room temperature!
4
Food is a tad salty but so totally delish. Coffee was very nice as well. Staff were friendly. Enjoyed it alot
5
Great pizza and great service. Desserts had little taste and can be improved.
Good vegetarian pizza for my veggie friends :)

The Cousins recently took a weekend trip to Singapore to attend the wedding of a friend. Arriving on the Friday and staying at the Westin (highly recommend) at Asia Square, we decided to have dinner at this nearby eatery.The food was mixed. Meatball starter was rubbery and tasteless. Not worth ordering especially given high price. Ham and mushroom pizza was enjoyable and shared between 2 adults was just enough in combination with the tasteless starter.However, the cousins were with baby cousin who at 17 months does not understand why she has to wait for food. To keep her calm we requested some plain bread which was refused by 2 or more of their staff. We were offered garlic bread at 14 sing bucks a portion but not sure that a kid of that age would enjoy the strong gallic flavours.The staff claimed that they had no bread in the restaurant (how do they make garlic bread then?) and showed no consideration towards a frustrated and upset child. Understand that this restaurant is located in the business district but given it provides high chairs it's probably used to a certain percentage of young diners.Food ok, service adequate. Miserable attitude to a child unacceptable. Needless to say Extra Virgin receives the reverse terminator award. The Cousins will not be spending in this restaurant again

I consider myself a bit of a pizza connoisseur so was pleasantly surprised at how tasty the pizza was here. I was bit confused when it was served on a metal trey only to realise after I had eaten it other dinners were using the small side plate to eat from. Strange. Overall, good service, good pizza and wine.
5
Both my kids are always craving for the pizza here, loves the dough and the pizza which is beautifully created and made. The spotted pig and 4 cheese is and will always be our Favourite!! This is certainly in our number 1 list for pizza! Great Pasta and service are as usual - always warm and friendly!
2
The dining setup was like a big canteen with tables lined closely packed to one another in a long stretch outside the restaurant located at Asia Square. One of the diners knocked his butt against the serving plate on my desk while maneuvering his way out of the tiny gap between the tables. Wonder if it's because of the one for one promotion. Ordered the hawaiian bbq chicken pizza and shrooms truffle oil pizza. The pizza was heavily spread with pizza sauce so it was very saltish and the crust was super tough, I noticed a lot of the diners left the crust uneaten
4
Went two years ago and was disappointed. Gave a second try yesterday due to 1-for-1 offer. Veggie pistachios pizza was quite ok with nice taste. However not sure will visit again as my colleague didn't enjoy much his own pizza (cannot remind which one but classic one for sure
3
Good variety of pizza with a slightly higher price... Consider ok at CBD area.. The wings I ordered was a little tough.
I can only say their pizza tasted better than Pizza Hut.
3
It's good dough and selection of fillings but I find it quite annoying that they burnt the edges every now and then.
5
Eclectic pizzas with a lot of variety. Located adjacent to the hotel. We were pretty tired so it served a quick and ready place to catch a fast meal.
5
This was the perfect spot for a quick dinner before we headed to the airport. The pizza was freshly made to order and the meatball appetizer was tasty thanks to the homemade sauce that it created daily at the restaurant. Located in the GBD - next to the Westin Singapore - it was a great outside (only) location to people watch. Service was prompt, credit cards were accepted and both beer and wine were offered on the menu. The food was tasty and reasonably priced
4
This place has very good pizzas. I have been here a couple of times with an Italian colleague and even he claims the pizzas are excellent. Not your typical American huge sized but simply creamy dough pie that some claim to be a pizza. This is the real deal: crispy, thin, fresh ingredients and toppings and virgin olive and chili oils to top it off. Decent prices considering it's Singapore and Asia Square
3
Visitors from the US may be surprised and disappointed by the small size of the pizzas on offer here, especially when they're priced at US $24 each. The restaurant is located in Asia Square alongside large banks and insurance companies, so perhaps it feels everyone will pay these high prices without complaint. I enjoyed what I ate but I left feeling ripped off
4
We popped by Extra Virgin for a leisurely weeknight dinner. For three people, we ordered the Pistachio Pesto Arugula Pizza and the Margharita Pizza with Buffalo Mozzarella. The former was delicious - the pesto was delicately flavoured and the arugula was super fresh. The Margharita was as good as any other one I've had around - the Buffalo Mozzarella didn't add the zing I was hoping it would. The crust was the clincher for me - thin, light, and crisp without being flaky or cracker-like. I'll definitely visit again, just for the Pistachio Pesto
4
Extra Virgin doesn't have any tables inside, but it doesn't matter since you get to people watch while you wait for your pizzas. The pizzas are excellent, the dough is light though a little flimsy. We had the Prosciutto and Rocket, Mushroom, Bacon Bad, and a surprisingly excellent pizza that contains pesto, arugula and pistachio that looks like a salad on top of a pizza crust. Everything was delicious. The beer selection is a rather thin, offering only Kirin on draft and a few bottled labels. They have an extensive wine list though but not being a wine drinker, I ignored it
3
My wife and I have been to both the United Square and Asia Square versions of this place. You can get a decent thin crust pizza at either place. We have had a problem with the pizza being undercooked in the middle (and kind of mushy) once but the other time they were cooked well and tasted nice. My wife had a seafood pizza and I had a white spicy pepperoni The pepperoni was thin but quite tasty Not as crisped as I would normally have but okay. My wife enjoyed the seafood pizza although the seafood was a bit on the light side (maybe four shrimp on the whole pizza). We had the wings our first visit and they were bland and tasteless so we won't do that again. The pizza's run for $22 to about $30 each and you generally can easily eat a pizza each (they aren't too large and are very thin).When we went they had two for one happy hour on a couple of kinds of beer (Kirin and Peroni) which made the beer prices okay.My wife had the nutella panna cotta which was tasty but very tiny for the prices..she called it a ripoff. One warning, at Asia Square, all the seating is outdoors, so make sure it is a cool breezy day if you don't want to roast. The United Square location has indoor seating that is pretty pleasant
5
Excellent pizza, salads, and pasta with water views in Singapore. My first meal in Singapore and it didn't disappoint. Standouts were the Caesar Salad- light on the dressing, super fresh parmesan, picture perfect ingredients. Pizza was sublime. Parma ham, juicy olives, fresh cheese. Balsamic and olive oil were also top notch. This place is pricey, but it's also so delicious and has a pretty quirky location. Outdoor seating is underneath huge vaulted entryway of a luxury office building with unobstructed courtyard. You can see businessmen and women powerwalking/running to their lunch break spots when the clock strikes noon. Almost like, a sea of suits. Also views of the bay
