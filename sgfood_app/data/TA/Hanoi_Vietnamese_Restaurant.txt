The lunch here with my husband was really yummy and tasty. We both had delicious Vietnamese rice noudle with beef and vietnamese coffee with ice and milk. We would recommend this place to our family and friends

Excellent value for money with their unlimited a la carte lunch menu with dishes that taste pretty close to authentic Vietnamese. We three were happy with the food quality and variety pleasantly surprised by the dish portions too. The soup noodles are FAR better than the ubiquitous Nam Nam. It's a travesty that decent restaurants like this one don't get the numbers in, versus subpar and overpriced franchises simply because of marketing and decor. Service was so much better too. Do give this place a try for healthy and tasty Vietnamese.

I've been here about 3 times and find the food to be delicious. I can't tell how "authentic" it is, despite having travelled to Vietnam, but if it tastes ok, it's good enough for me! Beef pho had a nice rich broth and stir fries are generous in portion with the right amount of seasoning. Prices are not cheap but given the quality and quantity, i think they're reasonable. Forget the over-rated (and often crowded) Nam Nam. Veering off the chains has its advantages

This restaurant is located near the Tanjong Pagar MRT station vicinity and is tucked away within 100AM building. The decor itself is has a mix feel of Vietnamese and Singapore style which has a nice feel to it's ambiance. In short, a cosy with a slight rusty feel for a laid back dinner suitable for small gatherings, brunch & couples. Although I find the lighting is a tad too green but overall is good.We ordered a few dishes and to our pleasant surprise, all of them tasted good (perhaps I was very hungry lol). The Stir-fried Chicken with Cashew Nuts portion is just right for the 2 of us, the nuts are crunchy and meat is pretty juicy compared to the ones I had in other restaurants. The Beef Combination Noodle Soup was also pretty nice with plenty of onions and the beef was done just right. The taste of the soup was rich and fill with that beefy tang to it so I would say it was just right my alley. I also had a Vitamin Joiy Joiy Juice which kinda taste like the Rosella 洛神花 (Luo Shen Hua) tea I had when i was in Taiwan. The taste is good but a bit pricey though.Service from the waitresses were also pretty good and they really "waited" for me as I wasn't sure what to order since I hadn't had much experience in Vietnamese food. They were pleasant and was constantly smiling thus I don't feel being pressured to the usual "order-as-fast-as-possible" look from waitresses I get from the other restaurants. There's even a paper napkin tray of a little boatman! Nice little touches makes for a better dinning experience.I wasn't really a big fan of Vietnamese cooking due to my past experiences with the usual run-of-the-mill Vietnamese street food which I've happened to chance upon. Somehow my taste for it has changed (for the better) since I ventured into this restaurant on nice & quiet Sunday evening. Perhaps yours too ;
