Nice atmosphere, service and food though a bit pricy. Was awesome sitting outside these days, might be bit noisy inside sitting near big groups
5
Thai food is absolutely delicious even better than those I had in bangkok. Customer service is also up to standard
4
For its reputation, the food (from taste perspective) was surprisingly under-delivered.
Seems like they worked with wine vendors who know how to store wine = really appreciated.
The decor was spacious yet did not detract from cosy feeling.
Service was above average.
4
Nice restaurant, perfect for visitors who want to get to know a bit about the Thai cousin.
Very good food and good service.
5
Third time there, and the service and food are as good as ever. Gorgeous setting - great place to bring out of town guests.
5
Came here for lunch and had a set menu. Food was very tasty, wholesome and authentic. Only comment is portion size which was on the smaller side which may be a good thing to prevent over eating.
5
I went for my birthday. The decor is great, they have Thai dancers that come through the restaurant periodically. The food was lovely, not quite as good as in Thailand itself, but very close! The green curry was great and the coconut ice cream really is a treat. They also do a series of Thai inspired cocktails, or classic cocktails with a Thai twist. I tried the Thai martini and thoroughly enjoyed it. The service was also very attentive. Itâ€™s not super cheap, but definitely well worth the visit
5
Came back to Jim Thompson for a business dinner, and it was spectacular. The green curry had just the perfect sweetness, the fish was tender and the Tom Yam Goong did not overpower at all. The staff was very courteous and the slow Thai dance and the ambience just sets the mood for a good night out.
4
We had a late booking at 2pm. Restaurant was fairly crowded on a Sat afternoon. We had the set menu. Options for 2 or 3 courses with the third course being dessert for 2 dollars more. So easy choice for us. You get to pick one starter from 4 choices and two mains from 5 choices. When I thought it is already a good meal to look forward to, the set menu also includes choice of drink and soup. Food portions were generous and tasty. Hence no need for dinner that night. Staff generally friendly. Enjoy.
5
Lovely ambience and great food here. We had a duck curry which was amazing and also had pad Thai. Both were excellent!
4
We again had dinner at Jim Thompson. We loved it. Great Thai food in Dempsey Hill. Service very attentive. Prices absolutely ok! We will be back again.
5
Very nice Thai atmosphere. Everything are very good. Restaurant staffs are professional. Paying attention to my table and ask something before we request. Meal was very good. Must come to this place!
4
Excellent variety and food. Few corners same minutes preparing variety of sea food Thai soups and salads.. oysters and sea food. Curries and deserts are amazing.. 65++ per person including juices/soft drinks and coffee ..
Fully recommended..

This restaurant offers some amazing vegetarian Thai cuisine.
Thai green curry and olive rice is a must try. The ambience of the place is also very good.
5
While in Singapore , my brother insisted we visit this restaurant since we had mentioned we liked Thai food. Classy started at the entrance with the beautifully dressed staff welcoming . Inside the ambiance was great. The food topped it all . The mango salad especially a great starter . We could not even leave a drop of soup in the bowl.
5
We were five including one vegetarian. Everyone ordered different dishes and each one of them was superb. Easily the best meal we had during our one week’s stay in Singapore this time. It is a Thai restaurant and going by the fact that we had gone on a week day and that the restaurant was absolutely full, it must be one of the most popular joints. To top it all, beautifully dressed Thai dancers periodically visit each table and entertain you with their graceful moves. Would certainly visit it again a week later when we would be in Singapore again

The imposing building is located in a quiet and green district of SGP. There in a large parking. The terrasse is not very attractive with long tables for - I guess - groups of tourists. Inside is incredibly astonishing: judge ceiling hight, a mix of neocolonial and Art Deco layout, pretty dancers performing from table to table and posing for a photo, very professional waitresses and comfortable atmosphere. The entrées sets are to recommend. They offer samples of tastes and fragrances. The food is delicate and the flavours are well balanced. Cookings are precise ( except the over-cooked deep fried fish bites) and the dish presentation is gorgeous. Main criticism will concern the price of the wines(120-150 $ a bottle) which doesn't match the quality nor the origin of the bottles. But the final bill, even not cheap at all, is not excessively dear.
2
My wife and I visited Jim Thompson for lunch expecting a similar experience to the Bangkok venue. Oh dear!Cheapest bottle of Chardonnay $90- was just the start. Staff very nice but everything else was poor.My Chicken satay entree was dry and not enough flavour or sauce. Duck Larb just OK but no real taste of lime or chili.My wife had the set lunch. Hot and Spicy prawn soup was good as was papaya salad. Green chicken curry and soft shell crab dish very bland.Verdict, an overpriced restaurant with ordinary food that will not get another dollar from us
5
Having tried both ala carte and buffet, I would highly recommend the ala carte menu as the dishes are more fresh and thus taste wise excellent. The menu is priced on a higher end, hence, I would say that Jim Thompson would serve as a special occasion place to eat. However, you get what you pay for, quality ingredients, freshly pounded salads to die for and flavourful mouthfuls of any dish you choose. I am particularly partial to the pomelo salads which come topped with perfectly grilled prawns. Furthermore, It is very ideal for vegetarians as they have a completely different menu with pure vegetarian dishes, so they feel more than welcome. I would recommend going for dinner as the ambiance, lighting, live thai dance creates a thai fairytale environement for that special memory you wish to have. There are no parking lots in the restaurant, but there is a parking lot opposite the restaurant
5
We ordered the yellow curry, and it came almost immediately! The staff are helpful and kind. The service is amazing! Not to mention, the food alone is terrific!
3
The food was decent and the ambience was great! However, certain items (eg. non alcoholic drinks) on the menu were pretty expensive and did not justify for the value.
5
We spend very good evening in this restaurant yesterday, interior is exotic and beautiful, I made the reservation through internet which was very easy and fast, there is a large choice of authentic, generous & tasty Thai dishes. The passage of typical Thai dancers in the room gives a plus on this nice atmosphere. We had an assortment of the best appetizers (a must try) then several dishes from the menu (I took the fish which was great), the prices are reasonable (except for the wine) for SingaporeI recommend this plac
5
our group of five have had our dinner here every six months for the past four years and this restaurant has never failed us. the ambience is perfect. waitresses are attentive. Food is delicious. however, for smokers, they no longer have tables for smoking but they have a designated smoking area instead. Indoor seating is classy and good for biz meeting or to impress your date.there is a dance performance during dinner.price is a bit pricey but to have good service and good food there is always a price tag to it.of course we will definitely be back for our next gatherin
3
A strange place - the outside veranda does not prepare you for the very traditional Thai restaurant interior inside (traditional in Thai restaurants outside of Thailand anyway). Staff were efficient and the food was decent enough but something is definitely lacking. I feel the food has been modified to suit non-Thai tastes, certainly the Pad Thai is not quite right. The soft shell crab larb on the other hand was excellent with a good level of chilli heat
5
Had our college alumni reunion dinner at Jim Thompson in Singapore. The interior design is simply wonderful. It feels like a little treasure tucked away from hustle and bustle of the busy city. The walk from drop off area to restaurant via garden has a calming effect. The wine selection is good and reasonably priced. The extensive food menu provides everyone the opportunity to taste the favours of Thailand. The service is wonderful. Overall, we all love the whole experience and will return soon
3
This place is a great place to bring for dates or if you are entertaining guests from overseas. They even have life performance to keep you entertained. Price wise, it is on the steeper side. Food wise, there are hits and misses. We enjoyed the tom yam goong and the fried prawns the best. While the pineapple fried rice and phad thai were pedestrian in taste and didnâ€™t leave much of an impression.
4
Came here to celebrate birthday lunch. The place was cosy and exotic, however, the price was at the higher $$$.7 of us order fried rice, morning glory, fish with chilli lime sauce, flat fried noodle, tom yam seafood, mango salad, garlic chicken as the main course. We ordered starter package for $55 came with 3 type of appetizer, and dessert we ordered 1 mango sticky rice. The staff came and sang birthday song with one candle on the sticky rice. It was fun! They gave complimentary 1 fruit platter.Overall the food was nice, the fish was a bit disappointed and below our expectation. Drinks we ordered 2 margaritas, 2 coconuts, 1 Thai milk tea, 1 beer. Total bill $550
5
I admit I was sceptical ... the place looks and feels really touristy ... but I was blown away by the food.The seafood Tom Yum was balanced and the seafood done just right - tender and very sweet. The appetiser platters were very good tooOn the pricey side, but guaranteed to impress if you are entertaining Make a reservation for weekends or Fri nights though ..
4
This is one if not the most unique restaurant in Singapore. Being in historical avenue and place is still a good start for restaurant business. This is the one example. The foods are, like other historical building food place, just ok. The service is rather bad because my tod man pla didn't show up. Overall you won't regret to visit this place but Just once in your life
4
Really good place for dating. It looks like a kind of palace in Thailand. Very high ceiling, spacious. The food was also fine. especially, soft shell crab.
4
the restaurant has nice ambiance, decor. The food was excellent, appetizer, tom yom soup, duck curry, dessert. However the service was a a bit inconsistent, some of us who ordered coffee did not even get served at the end.
5
Nice family dinner with great food, live entertainment and a happy birthday song from the staff, excellent
4
Located in a lovely area, the restaurant offers delicious Thai food. We had a broad selection including some great wines. In a separate room, it was a lovely evening.
5
Food is tasty and ambience is very good. It is a good place to enjoy Thai Food. Good for dating couples !
3
We were there for dinner. Friendly staff. Food is very well presented, however food can be improved and have a signature food. Pricey compared to other authentic fine dining Thai restaurant.Ambient wise; could have warmer type of light. Need to speak slightly louder to guest seated opposite as the table is slightly wider.
4
We visited this restaurant two times in 4 days because the food is really good. I think we had the best curry with chicken we ever had in our life. The noodles are also delicious. I think you can order almost everything from the menu - everything will be delicious. But the restaurant is really pricey!
4
Went there for dinner with my client who is gluten intolerant - the staff is not really sure of the concept of gluten and I Guess it would help giving them a brief on gluten intolerance and the what can have and what cannot.Apart from that - food was decent, prompt and service was nice Must mention that they have an excellent vegetarian menu
4
Visited with family in October 2017. Great food, lovely mocktails, good service although could be better. Service was OK but I got the impression that many of the waitresses were new to the restaurant. The place is regularly used for celebrations - anniversaries and birthdays - I think we saw about 5 "happy anniversaries" and "happy birthdays". Really nice family place.Would recommend you book before going (your hotel will be able to do this). And make sure your cab driver knows where they are going - get a postcode for their satnav because the roads around the area have been changed so it's easy to miss!Ask the restaurant to also book you a cab back - they usually meet you at the roundabout which is about 10m away - nice little Thai garden for you to wait around in.Not much choice for vegatarians which is a real shame; but meat and fish eaters will be fine.Would recommend you go the to the restaurant hungry - the dishes are a good size so a starter and main will fill you up. The dessert selection isn't great so probably worth going elsewhere for that
4
The restaurant was beautiful! If I had to use 1word to describe it, that would be it. The decor, lighting was perfect. I loved the huge slow moving fan. Do look up when you are there...While there was seating out, we chose to sit in as it was still humid out in the open. Service was great....little Thai dance performances were quite nice too. I was little disappointed with the quality of the food though. While papaya prawn salad was great both the chicken skewers and chicken leaf were bland and undercooked. Perhaps the staff should have asked or guided us better....Youâ€™ll love the seating...wide big sofas and chairs, very vibrant
5
Exqusite food prepared with refinement. The Thai dance performance though cliche dud add to the atmosphere & was not out of place.
2
Waitress provided only 2 choices of water - Sparkling or still which are chargeable. When they should be asking if we want water. And when i asked to change for tap, they didn't allow it.
4
Escaped from the madness of the Grand Prix and enjoyed a delightfully relaxing lunch.
Good service, extensive menu (really rather long), tasty food and strong cocktails...
Beautifully decorated as you'd expect.
4
Authentic and great atmosphere
Definitely recommended, buffet had a good spread and the right level of spices
3
Really nice location, but average food and high prices. I doubt I will go back, Thai Food is much better at Tawandang just up the road.
5
Never disappointed with Jim Thompson restaurant. The extensive food menu, the tasty food, the wine list, the ambience and the level of service make this an enjoyable experience.
5
Totally loved the ambiance and food.
The place has a separate vegetarian menu which is amazing.
Its perfect for special events or for taking guests out for a beautiful evening.
4
Awesome experience. Lovely decor and lovely food. Thai dancers and high ceiling makes it a completely enjoyable experience.
5
Sunday Brunch was as amazing as ever. Easily the best Thai food event both in terms of quantity and quality. We visit Singapore from Kuala Lumpur every 2-3 months and Sunday Brunch at Jim Thompson is a "must do" during every visit.
4
I always go to Jim Thompson during my visits to Singapore. The food is great, just the perfect balanced flavors. It's family friendly as well, which makes it perfect for any occasion. They have these cute dancers who come around during a meal and they just make the experience even more authentic through their traditional Thai dances.The food is wonderful, the main reason I keep going back.The whole fish, green curry, fish cakes are few of my favorite dishes here
4
Decent Thai food in Singapore, classy restaurant, big size with nice outdoors. Decent food . Be prepared for hole in your pocket
4
If you want authentic, fresh, quality thai then go here. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great from be greeted at the door to the in meal thai dancing. Fantastic!
5
What a beautiful restaurant, food was amazing, service was impeccable, the Thai ladies dancing was a lovely touch. Was a little Pricey but well worth it! Highly recommend!!
5
The service is excellent and patrons are treated really treated well with attention. Love e ambience and e service !
4
Fantastic authentic Thai food which was excellent. Great atmosphere with traditional Thai dancing. Highly recommended.
3
Beautiful architecture, stunning decor, courteous/efficient service - but very tame flavors and uninspired dishes (mediocre satay, humdrum spring rolls, and a flat pomelo salad). The stir fries and red curries were less disappointing, but still not worthy of the hype.
2
The WORST soup I ever had was at Jim Thompson in Singapore... It was sweet... Imagine.Had to send the Pandan Chicken back. Satay Chicken was off. The prawns looked great, tasted not right. Olive Rice was good. Service was appalling.... I love the look and feel of the place, but walked out grossly disappointed..Avoid.Bhagwan
4
Good location, great food, nice decor but service made it feel like a fast-food, fast-turnover joint. The menus were thrust at my wife and I the instant we sat down and that unfortunately set the tone for the evening. We were then asked 3 times in the next 5 minutes if we were ready to order, despite having just ordered drinks and not having even opened the menus. Having batted back the over attentive (but very pleasant) waitresses we ordered 3 starters which arrived within 5 minutes - just about OK time-wise and they were good portions and delicious - pomelo salad, prawn with chilli-lime and minced chicken.Starters over and immediately we were asked about main course which we delayed ordering for a few minutes, then ordered green chicken curry with jasmine rice which arrived within 2-3 minutes of the order being taken! This was also delicious but once finished and even while the main course was being cleared, we were asked if we wanted to order dessert. We didn't. This is a top-rate restaurant $ wise and we had to resist the pressure seemingly placed on us to order and get out. If the restaurant had been absolutely full with people waiting for tables I could have understood - but not forgiven - the over-attentiveness of the service, but the fact is the restaurant was busy but by no means full. There was also no-one obviously in charge who we could have spoken to.So in summary - nice restaurant, great food but they do need to have a serious word with their charming but much too eager serving staff
5
I ate at Jim Thompson's with some coworkers while on a recent business trip to Singapore. The food was scrumptious, the service excellent, and we were entertained by dancers during our meal. We sat inside, but outside seating was lovely as well. I had a Singapore Sling at this restaurant, and it was delicious! I would highly recommend this restaurant for food and atmosphere
5
Good points : - lovely waitress- good service- beautiful space- good acoustics- very nice food - very fine taste- very polite staff- child friendly Bad points : - no bad points. Maybe the price is high, but if you can afford, it worth it !
5
Everything about this restaurant is beautiful. The unobtrusive Thai dancers, the lovely clothing of all the servers, the attentive service, the décor, and of course the tasty authentic food.
5
y environment and excellent Thai food. The drink list is typical and we have broad options. We enjoyed the fish cake and curry a lot!
4
We went there to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday the food quality was good the ambience was nice it has both systems outside in the lawn as well as closed. The light Thai welcome and quiet Thai dance was good overall great evening
2
Great ambience and service, but very average food. The food was very oily and extremely sweet. Disappointed as I went in with a lot of expectations; even took my parents in law along during their visit to Singapore and they didn't like it at all!
5
Excellent Thai food, in a restaurant with real ambience. Off the beaten track, and not cheap, but worth the trip and the cost. Will definitely be back again !
1
One thing which is super frustrating is when they tell you it is open until midnight and then citchen closes at 22:30
4
The atmosphere was pleasant, the food was really taste and delicious.
The price it is high but not as expensive as the orders. The best Pathai I have eaten.
I went there many times for friend. Best place for big group.
4
We visited Jim Thompson restaurant based on a friend's recommendation and really enjoyed our evening. The restaurant is in a very pretty setting and is spacious inside. The cocktail list is imaginative and suits the theme. Food is well-priced, beautifully presented, and each of our dishes was fragrant, fresh and tasty. During our evening there was no water available in the ladies toilets which was a bit off-putting in a food service venue (not sure how the kitchen staff were washing their hands as there was no hand washing facility available for customers ... luckily I had wet wipes with me)
5
I've been to Jim Thompson twice now, and both times have loved the experience. The building itself is huge and just so gorgeous, in traditional Thai style decorations. Both times there has also been a Thai dancer moving through the restaurant, adding to the ambience. We were there for lunch, and I highly recommend the limited lunch menu. It includes a choice soups, 1 appetizer, 2 mains, optional dessert, and drinks. So, between the 2 of us, we end up with soups, 2 appetizers and 4 mains to enjoy! A great way to get a taste of the menu. The serving sizes are not huge, but more than enough over the course of the meal. The service is excellent, really polite and on-the-ball. It feels really special, but actually fantastic value for what you get, in my opinion.
5
Yes, it is somewhat expensive, however the setting, the ambiance and atmosphere,the delicate dancers that do not disturb your conversations of meals, just delicately dancing and passing by in silence, the excellent Thai food makes the visit worthAs everything, it goes with personal tastes. In my personal view, the entire set is also part of enjoying the food, the tastes.I will return, no doubt
4
Great location, nice ambiance, good sitting in or out. Good wines, decent thai food, especially for vegetarians, good wines and a nice evening out.
3
The food was nice, but not very special. The ambience was good, there was a table with 30 people, but it didn't bother us. And the service was very good.
5
Had a visit with colleagues. My first visit to Dempsey Hill...great experience. Food at Jim Thompson was very good, especially the entrees. The coconut ice cream was spectacular.......thoroughly enjoyed my visit there
5
All staff are proactive & thoughtful with their services & food recommendations...👍🏼
They have serve us well on my wedding anniversary with group singing & complimentary fruits which my Wife was so touch.
Well done!
4
Beautifully presented and delicious Thai food in a peaceful setting. A place to revisit time and time again.
4
We had ladies lunch meeting. They have nice lunch set menu, so if we can not start all together at same time it will be vey convenient .
5
This Thai Fine dinning place has seating outside the place also, surrounded by green forest on the hill. They have separate menu for vegetarians to make life easy. We opted for set starters with salad, one with mango, too good. Also tried papaya salad & lastly a soup with coconut milk and lots of vegetables. Didn't had appetite left for deserts. Prompt service and courteous staf
5
One of my favorite restaurants and not just in Singapore. I have been there for lunch and dinner, with business colleagues and family and each time it was outstanding. Fantastic authentic Thai food with great service and a welcoming atmosphere. Outdoor seating is available that can accommodate business receptions, couples or families. Moderately priced and a fully stocked bar. Close to the Botanical Gardens and Dempsey Hill. Highly recommended
4
Ambience, furnishings, in-door and out-door setup of this colonial building where Jim Thompson is residing, is as elegant and exotic.Special Thai dancers performance has always been captivating for our guests.Staffs were attentive and provide good recommendations from the menu.Unfortunately, dishes were palatable... fish cake could add a little more tenderness and fish taste, pad thai can be more tasty, durian dessert would be excellent when the fresh durian seed was more ripe
5
Based on a recommendation by a friend who is a renowned Chef I chose Jim Thompsons for my son's 14th birthday dinner. Could not have chosen a better place, the food was outstanding, creative and yummy and beautifully set up and the service was impeccable. As a Finn I found the prices very reasonable and everything was of great value. The service was extremely friendly and what really made the evening special was that my son was welcomed with a surprise candlelight dessert accompanied by a birthday song by beautifully dressed staff members. All this was completely unexpected as I only mentioned his birthday briefly when coming in. We felt truly welcome and appreciated and will be sure to visit again. Thank you ❤
5
The Thai buffet at Jim Thompson on Sunday has to surely rank as one of the best meal options in Singapore. Simply outstanding in every aspect i.e. selection, quality, service, value for money. Will be returning again and again. Thank you Jim Thompson.
4
Wonderful surprising experience. Had a nights out and we were happy with the service. Surprise with dancers and even there was a birthday song in the next tables
3
Excellent menu. Slow service, food not up to par! A little let down as there where a lot of singing and shouting due to bdy parties. Not ok here I think. Need more sophistication from staff and kitchen. High prices.
5
Had dinner with family friends. The food wa delicious, the spice chicken soup with coconut had an exquisite taste. The mango sticky rice was also an exceptional desert. I would recommend the restaurant for food lovers if they like Thai food.
5
You MUST visit Jim Thompson for some outstanding, authentic and fresh Thai food. We had family visiting from NZ and we wanted to treat them to a nice meal. They are regular Thai goers back home but they were very impressed with not just the quality of the food but the atmosphere and service. It can hit the wallet a little more than normal but totally worth it.
3
It's hard to find good Thai food in Singapore and even here the food tends to be a little oily but the prawn mango salad is outstanding. Definitely, though, the food doesn't justify such high prices and you feel that you are paying the premium for the decor rather than for the cuisine
5
My wife and I are a big fan of JIM THOMPSON bags, clothings, scrafs and accessories. When come to fine Thai dinning travel no further than Minden Road, off Napier Road a stone throw from Dempsey Hill.We recommend you come early just after 6pm and start with cocktails or drinks. Enjoy the Thai dancers performance. Followed by ordering of appetisers and starters and Tom Yam Goong (must try), green curry (chicken or beef or prawn), steamed sea bass with garlic chili lime sauce and pineapple rice.
5
The restaurant is located on a quiet street, which makes outdoor terrace a very peaceful place to dine. The exterior of the building reminds of British colonial times, while interior design with large columns evokes the feeling of grandeur. All waiters and dancers are dressed in traditional Thai clothing and greets you with smile. The menu has lots of interesting Thai classics. We had papaya salad for starters, which shall I say was quite spicy, so the flavors were muted. However, the curries were simply outstanding and the portions were adequate. Coupled with food presentation in a very traditional style, this venue guarantees a charming experience from beginning to end.
5
The food and service are always 10/10. Prices are commensurate but not exorbitant. Pomelo salad - yam som o - is always on our order as it is heavenly. The fayre is authentic, if a tad less spicy than you might find in Thailand. The artistic decor, ambience, Thai dancers, history of the building and Jim Thompson story are always intriguing for visitors when we bring them. Sitting inside or out works in the evening. Outside faces a quiet road and St George's Anglican Church. In short, a TOP, all round value restaurant.
3
Beautiful surroundings , dancers . Great ambience. Food was fabulous - vast amount to choose from. Service was all wrong - we ordered cocktails , wine , one starter and 5 main meals. Wine came first , we told them to take it away, main courses came - no starter had come , cocktails hadn't arrived by this point either . My husband complained bitterly and they took everything away and started again. Overall a lovely evening . Would I go back - probably not - service is a major point when I'm having a meal .
5
This nice sprawling restaurant with an open area too would surely have over 200 covers & is a nicely located in Dempsey hill. The food was nice & being vegetarian we had a nice spread of starters, curries, pad Thai noodles & deserts.
Reservation recommended.
5
The combination of the beautiful design of the interior, the Thai service and beautiful dancers and the cuisine makes Jim Thompson a must to visit. The menu is robust and pricing fair given the overall dining experience one enjoys.
4
Food quality was generally alright for the buffet spread. The grills were cold though. Service was courteous and attentive.
4
Nice Environment to celebrate Mothers' Day. Excellent services and variety of food from the Buffet Spread. However the food is not hot enough will be nice if all food serve hot.
5
A good place to be for thai food in Singapore and we certainly do not regret it. The pad thai and fried rice were excellent. Service is friendly and the ambiance is authentic enough to command a relaxing atmosphere for dining.
5
High quality interesting Thai food in a wonderful setting . Great team looked after us beautifully . Look
Forward to working our way though the menu on future visits.
5
Upscale Thaifood in a unique and nice area in SingaporeWhen visiting Singapore I always eat there. Food is consistently great. Thaifood is very delicious and tastefulStuff is very nice and you get some Thai dancers walking around in intervalsPlace is due to it's performance always full - so I highly recommended to book a table in advanc

Jim Thompson is always on our restaurant list when we have guests from Europe. The setting is beautiful with this mix of Thai, Colonial style and outside the holiday feeling. The food is a little bit on the pricey side but still quite good. There are better thai restaurants in Singapore but non of them is as beautiful as Jim Thompson. Normally our visitors are not having everyday thai food so the Jim Thompson selection is more than good. We order the mixed starters, pomelo salad , some curries ..... don't forget to order their brown rice!If you stay outside there is also every 30 minutes a dancing show.Demsey is also always good to grab a taxi for the way home
2
Food delicious; service was slow and inattentive. Two of our guests asked for wine, one for a glass of Pinot and the other for a Chardonnay. No taste was given - a small glass of each was poured including the tail end of one bottle for 1/3 the glass of Pinot and a new bottle (no taste given of this one) for the remaining 2/3, poured directly in. So bizarre. Worse still, when we saw the bill, each glass was 40sgd -- dramatically more than a "house wine" should be. They weren't even tasty! Poor form.
5
At first the idea of going Jim Thomson sounded like a tourist trap. And until you entered the huge barrack that was the central eating area, I still felt that way. But it is worth going to just for the what they have done to the barrack. Once you get past that, eat the food. It was really worth the ride to Dempsey Hill. And their servings were large leaving 7 of us unable to finish what we ordered. Doggy bags to the rescue. Go there
5
Visited Jim Thompson with friends. The ambience is great - the building is a converted barrack, and the food was delicious. Try the steamed fish.
4
Great ambience and attentive service. Food is pretty authentic but not cheap. Good for date nights and entertaining out of town guests.
5
From a friend. While not street food spicy, food was well prepared, good portion and still taste authentic Thai. Service was excellent, attentive but not intrusive, gives good recommendation. Overall a good total package of food, ambience and service.
5
For lunch, the set menu is an awesome deal. Absolutely yummy dishes with authentic Thai flavors. Highly recommend!
4
Loved the ambience, thai interiors and whole set up. The thai curry was amazing and my friends love the satays. Highly recommend Jim Thompson for a regal meal. Just as good as the one in Bangkok, an old favourite for my family and me.
5
My third visit. Great introduction to Thai food to our overseas guest. Beautiful ambience with fantastic service.
5
Our visit followed a personal, family recommendation and we chose it to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. The food was excellent as was the service being personal and attentive. The delicious fresh fruit 'sculpture' in recognition of our celebration was very kind and thoughtful and well received
5
Located in Dempsey Hill, this restaurant transports you to Thailand. The decor is splendid and the food quality matches the decor. It is not cheap but it is worth it for celebration. My Favourite is the duck curry! The starters are delicious!The desert menu is also incredible! Wine is quite expensive like all restaurants in Singapore but beer is affordable. Dancers will come sometimes to entertain. The place had a wonderful ambiance! Always to try to find an excuse to go back :-

~one weekend we stumbled upon Jim Thompson after going to the White Rabbit and found it booked for a wedding luncheon ... ~we were the only one parked (free private parking prolly 10 lots) and the unassuming but well decorated exterior was a quiet lazy look of a well manicured garden (although the raised deck made it easier to look after)~while we'd no reservations, lunch wasn't a crowded affair and the hostess while courteous was taking some time ... i dunno what it was but the Thai's aren't very concerned with rushing and it didn't alarm me either...~the dining room ambience, mood lighting and super high ceiling is a cozy environment for dining. The beautiful Thai dancer who performs every 30mins is another elegant touch to your visitGolden Triangle Set - vermicelli & minced chicken spring rolls, prawn cakes, king prawns, green papaya salad served with 3 dips of varying flavors & spice YUMzKhao Phad Gai - fried rice with chicken is a good fluffy, not oily dish of delicious YUMz Surawong Fizz - super refreshing thai ginger concoction All that was in January, on my second visit in April also for an early weekend lunch I'dGolden Triangle Set - consistent YUMzKhao Phad Sappalot Goong Sod - pineapple fried rice with prawns will feed 2 or 3, the black raisins are a nice mix YUMzKhao Niow Durian - the mountain cat durian intrigued me and the generous helping of coconut milk did it for me YUMz x2~on my second visit at 12pm without a reservation, we'd left with the restaurant almost full~the only waiting time is at the hostess counter at the entrance where you can see folks milling about inside the restaurant but apparently only designated staff are going to come to serve you, however once I was at the table it was polite lovely Thai service till the endThe food is divine, definitely be back... this location will support family & business visits PLUS romantic outings including wedding receptions :

The ambience and service is the foundation the first makes you take noteDancers slowly move through the restaurant and pass your table with a smile that makes your feel good even on a bad day The menu is huge so many selections all well prepared and spiced to the right level not too much not too little Pick your favorite Thai meal and you won't be disappointed
5
The food was very good, ambience of thai was complete with thai dancers, the staff also was very helpful
5
I like jim Thompson because food is great, staff are nice ...they service is on time, the variety of drinks are amazing
4
Great stuff, good-selection of menu, very tasty food, they even have a couple of dancer too that once in a while will cross your table and do this kinda dance and smile (which I found a bit creepy) reasonable price for such menu. Went there on Tuesday night, crowd mostly expats or business exec having dinner with colleagues or else

We love Thai food, so it is an absolute pleasure to write how wonderful this restaurant is. In an historic building surrounded by greenery, beautifully styled inside and on the huge open air deck. We'd had a light, quick lunch here 18 months ago but dinner is the primo experience. The restaurant was full inside and out, traditionally dressed dancers greet guests on arrival in between delightfully choreographed performances. Service was warm, attentive and efficient, no small feat in Singapore! We let the menu guide us and chose the house specialties - rice paper prawn rolls, fish cakes and chicken in Pandan leaves for starters; beef massuman curry and a duck salad for mains. The kitchen will ease up on the Chilli in a dish like the duck, if you ask. All this with cold singhas and a lovely bottle of Pinot Gris! And if that wasn't perfect enough, when we remarked on how lovely the custom singha glasses were, our friendly barman kindly turned up with a parting gift of two! We will not only return, we will bring friends to this authentic tribute to the Land of Smiles :)

We had not been for dinner in a long time (kids are allergic and we don't have a sitter) and noticed they were now on Deliveroo so we gave it a shot. It was fantastic. Really good quality, fast delivery, and for the category of food the prices were "reasonably" (ahem). Highly recommended, much better than the other Thai options on Deliveroo

If you are looking for Thai food and fine dining, especially to impress business associates, look no further. The food is excellent and authentic Thai. Appertizer platters are really good start to the meal, Tom Yum seafood was spicy and delicious! Green curry chicken is slightly above average as the gravy is not as thick as I would like. Pineapple and olive rice are good selections too to go along with the dishes. Seafood are very fresh! There is an impressive drinks and wine list too. In addition, there are some Thai cultural dances throughout the dinner time, moving from sections of the restaurant to another. They have both outdoor and indoor seating. Outdoor is definitely more casual and relaxed. Parking is convenient with both onsite and an open parking area opposite road. One of the nicest and cleanest rest rooms I have seen too. Service is very prompt and attentive too. However be prepared for higher prices for this Thai fine dining experience

This restaurant is on Dempsey Hill has an amazing architecture - near 30 feet high ceilings with a very (very) large ceiling fan. There is enough space between the tables so that we can have conversations that aren't overheard by the adjacent tables.there is an outdoor dining area as well that can be wonderful if the climate is suitable.The variety was large and the food was awesome. the wait staff were very helpful. will definitely recommend thi

My second visit here and on this occasion I was accompanied by my daughter in law.The restaurant comprises a large building with a lavish interior which is basically split between three interconnecting sections, the whole being high ceilinged which absorbs the conversational noise most effectively. Outside is an extensive seating area with tables set well apart, water features and the occasional bat swooping past which rather adds to the ambience!The restaurant offers a wide selection of Thai themed food which both looks and tastes good. There are several reviewers here banging on about the lack of 'authenticity' who really ought to know what to expect from an internationally branded restaurant!The restaurant appeared to be full, we enjoyed ourselves
5
We had a lovely meal at Jim Thompson's this week. The restaurant is set in a stunningly converted Black and White property in Dempsey and the staff were friendly and welcoming. The menu is simple - and the food was well presented, The starter of spring rolls was delicious - and I had a fabulous salad with Pomello, alrthough I wasn't too keen on my fishcakes. The mains were lovely and my husband's beef curry was super. They currently have LP champagne on a good price for Singapore too. I'd definately go back, and I though the atmosphere was really superb.
4
An old friend took us there for lunch..the neighbourhood is rather quaint . We were there at noon the hostess at the front was not as friendly her body language spoke volumes(rather negative). However once we were seated both the ladies who served us were very attentive. I had the Tom Kai soup with alot of seafood my husband had the Tom yom soup our friend had the veg. pad thai we also had the shrimp appetizers all the dishes were delicious.It is difficult to rate a luncheon as we tend to eat and order less. However it appears to be a very good restaurant
5
Excelent thai food with the delicacy of thai dancers and a great atmosphere! Good value: a lifetime experience!
5
The ambience is lovely both indoors as well as outdoors. The bathroom too has a cute outdoorsy feel.
The Thai papaya salad was excellent! And the cocktails were great too!
Didn't enjoy the paper rice sushi though.
5
Great set up - courteous service. The .food was excellent - one of the better Thai restaurants meals that I have eaten in. Strongly recommend it though pricy final bill but worth it
5
Another great afternoon brunch with great service and exceedingly good quality wine and food - have yet to be disappointed by this restaurant.
5
Authentic experience, excellent food, relaxing friendly ambiance, smiling helpful staff. I will recommend this place to my friends.

Decided to try this fine dining Thai restaurant after feeling dissatisfied with the current haunt of another fine Thai restaurant. Car park is well situated on same grounds. Grand entry to the restaurant which gives a nice long view of the outdoor seating and graced by costume Thai lady dancers. Well greeted even though I had made reservations through a restaurant booking app. Had our table changed into the inside and am impressed by the well decorated interior and colors. Food was good however they were cold when brought to me. Wished they were hot cos that would blend with the spice. Had the starter Sukhothai followed by delicious Tom yum gai and yellow curry fried soft shell crab and red curry with roasted duck and the tang hoon crab. Asking had the mixed vegetables but this was rather disappointing. Had wine and the good tasting Singha draft !! Had more drinks out at the outdoor seating and was very pleasant overall. Staffing was bit short and wished some of the staff could be friendlier like the others. Good recommendation for Thai fine dining. Price on high side but compensated by ambience and food ingredient quality.
4
The name Jim Thompson does not conjure up thoughts of Thai food but it delivers on the cuisine nonetheless. The space is a bit cavernous, so I would not think of it as a spot for a romantic dinner, but the service and food are excellent. My only complaint would be that they tend to tone down the level of spiciness relative to what one would get in a lot of other Thai restaurants
5
This marvellous restaurant was recommended to us by someone very familiar with high-end Thai cooking and it did not disappoint. The flavours were individually distinguishable in each dish and overall it was wonderful. Service was great and the staff were very friendly. Enough said, this could be a special occasion place..
2
Food is okay but service is not up to standard. Maybe cos i am not a farang . Asked the waitress who is thai to explain in thai she wasnt very happy . I would be happy if i can get to meet my own country men is i work overseas. Overall food is ok . But cant say much for the service .
4
Environment and food were very good. The only thing I'd mention is that it isn't a child-friendly restaurant at all....my son was crying and someone came and asked me to bring him outside as he was "disturbing other guests". I do understand he was crying and maybe someone may have complained, but the least they could do is apologize and talk to me in a much nicer way, the way it was done wasn't polite or gentle at all. Wouldn't go back because of this....it's Singapore and everywhere here is child-friendly.Also, $12 for a fresh juice was too overpriced...I can buy a few watermelons with this money
5
A must try if you like thaï food in Singapore ! The decoration is very nice and the service is great. We had a very nice moment here.
4
Having been to the Jim Thompson in Bangkok I was not disappointed here. The food is very good and the ambience is pleasant. I had the Pad Thai and it was very nice. This is a great place for a "girls afternoon".
5
Spent a very nice evening here in a company of six and we were all very happy with the food.
Nice presentations lovely service and the taste made me wanna come back
4
Recommend the fried rice. The appetizer set is fantastic and variety choices.
However, the transportation is not convenient . Must take taxi.
5
This is my third visit to restaurant and as usual the place is amazing when it comes to delivering great food and ambienceService was a bit slow but I would still rate the overall quality to be exceptional when I compare to other restaurants in singaporeIt is quite pricy but when u get a great food and service, you don't mind spending bucks!!
4
Took my parents here for a special dinner out their last night in town. Literally had a server standing behind our table ready to refold napkins and refill water glasses most of the night. The place is absolutely beautiful. The dancers are a bit hokey, but they are fun and ready to pose for awkward tourist photos.The food is just okay. Good but not Great. For the price, I would normally expect excellence on the menu, but honestly everything else about this place kind of make up for it. Go for the service and the ambiance
5
Thai in Dempsey hill, away from the crowd and the noise, the restaurant is in a beautiful setting. I prefer to eat outside in the terrace for dinner, it is very romantic.. The atmosphere is great with Thai dancers. Great selection of Thai food. This is one of my favourite place in Singapore
5
A great location - on the edge of the Singapore Botanical Gardens and a welcoming atmosphere. This restaurant is one of our favorites in Singapore. If you like great service, a reasonable priced and extensive menu and fantastic Thai food this is the place for you!! Lunch or dinner are both great! Highly recommended
5
I don't think the overall ratings do this place justice. I have eaten here at least three times and it's been a great choice each time! Great service, food and atmosphere. Love the traditional dancers! I especially like that the tables are not too close together. Good wine selection.
5
From the moment I arrived at this amazing restaurant, I felt that I was in for a treat.Charming Thai dancers accompanied us to our table. I could not help ordering a Singapore Sling to start.My friends and I ordered different dishes which we all shared. I enjoyed the Green chicken curry, the Pad Thai, the soft shell crab salad. The price of Sing $320 for 7 was almost reasonable.The location, far from the madding crowd, is great. The restaurant is simply lovely
5
The food is really nice especially the corn cakes. They have outside sitting with live thai music and dance. Green curry and phat thai are worth a try.
5
We were served by the most amazing team of staff. The food was commendable but the overall experience from the staff was nothing more then fantastic. Made the whole trip worthwhile. Keep up the positive vibes!
5
The food is amazing. The vegetarian choices are really so many ..which is otherwise difficult in Singapore. The birthday song is soo cute. Would love to come here again.
5
Big variety of everything Thai you may like, served on Buffet but also 5 to 6 dishes additional to order a la carte..Salads, curries, soups, main course and divine deserts and fruits accompanied by free flow of fresh juices and soft drinks. All inclusive at the price of 68sgd++.Very good value for money .

This is our 6 visit to Singapore so decided to visit Jim Thompson a second time round last night. We started of with the tom yum prawn soup and chicken tom yum and noticed that the chicken tasted and smelt strange very similar to meat being left out in the heat for a long period. We thought maybe it was a particular reaction with the Thai spices and so ordered the classic green chicken curry. Terrible choice! The chicken was again smelly and tasted off. Told the waitress and manageress, she said she thought it was very interesting that we picked up on that smell and she totally agreed that it tasted strange but did not admit that the meat was off, she just deducted this from the bill without us asking!that pretty sums up the quality of the meat that they are aware of!My husband and I have had a runny tummy all night straight after dinner. Don't bother making the track to jim Thompson and don't let the mood setting of the restaurant with the Thai music and Thai dancers deceive you
4
We went here with my husband and mother for dinner one Friday evening. We were greeted at the door by traditionally dressed ladies, which was a nice surprise. Cocktails were a little on the pricey side, but we enjoyed the Lord Jim Mojito. The thai basil mojito was less impressive. Food was ok overall, and together with the setting made for a very pleasant experience
4
My wife and I visited the Jim Thompson on Christmas Eve. We had dinner at another restaurant in the area but decided to check out Jim Thompson for their desserts.I was impressed with the decor and did not realise, even though I passed by this building quite often, that the interior is actually very spacious and it has a high ceiling in the main hall.We ordered the famous Mango with sticky rice and coconut ice cream. The dish was well presented, staff are friendly.It was an enjoyable meal. I will return another day to try their main dishes
5
I first fell in love with the Jim Thompson culinary 'brand' in Bangkok. This restored old army barracks restaurant does not disappoint in all regards of ambience, decor, cuisine and service. Attention to detail is noted in the crisp white table cloths and the iconic gold edged blue and white Thai crockery in contrast to the vast ceilinged urban industrial chic architectural styling of the building. Even the toilet area is tastefully landscaped with tropical features. On Sunday there is a fabulous buffet and bookings are essential. The Pad Thai was fresh, exquisite and served immaculately.
4
Dinner yesterday with my husband and his 2 co workers, here in Singapore.The restaurant itself was really lovely. Lots of people. Service was confusing, they spoke really bad English. I ordered for all of us to share, that was a hard concept for them to understand! Have they been to Thailand? However food was very good, but not great. Priced accordingly to place, quality and taste. We had golden triangle starter, chicken satay which was disappointed, 4mini skewers!! and not fab. Mangosalad and Fiskcakes, with panko on, that is a no. Red prawn curry, holy basil chicken, laab moo, broccoli in oyster sauce. Coconut ice cream, fresh but not creamy. The Thai dance was not really appreciated as there was no music and the girls acted like robots, very artificially. Too many birthday celebrations with the staff singing, too much for the rest of the guests. Overall ok and yes I would come back because as a whole it was good
4
Went there for our 20th Anniversary lunch. Food is excellent; every dish you order has its own flavor. A bit pricey, but you know that going in. The spice level seems to have been tempered a bit, maybe to cater to the expat crowd. I would have preferred a bit more spice in the food.The only disappointment was the girl at the reception. We had an advance booking, and I told her it was for our 20th anniversary as we walked in. Still, she was seating us in the middle of the room, surrounded by other full tables, even though the restaurant wasn't really crowded. We had to specifically ask for a table by the wall, with the high-back sofa. It would also help if she learned to smile a bit
5
Did some shopping in Dempsey and had craving for Thai food on the way home stopped by here And had great meal. Food portions were flavourful and beautiful. Well worth a visit.
5
Superb Food and service as usual. Never been disappoint. Must have the curries, pandan chicken and crab cake
5
A total experience you should try. Delicious food beautifully presented and fantastic service, in a beautiful place. Really lovely to end your evening sitting on the terrace outside too.
5
I have been experiencing this restaurant for a business lunch and I have to admit this is definitely one of the best Thai cuisine I have been able to taste in more than 10 years I spent traveling in South East Asia. The chicken satay, the green curry with prawns and everything we ordered was simply outstanding. The location is really nice and the service has been professional and well prepared.

On a bright Sunday morning, we decided to visit a fancy Thai Restaurant to celebrate the success of my 4 year old grandson at Taekwondo where he got a promotion to a higher 'belt' far ahead of his age! It had to be Jim Thompson on Dempsey Hill. The exotic locale looked bright and inviting as did the super polite hostess in traditional Thai attire!!Our order included a platter of four Starters followed by Pad Thai, Mushroom & Olive Fried Rice,Stir Fried Vegetable with Tofu and Papaya Salad. Our drinks order included Passion Fruit Juice, Lime & Soda. The Service was prompt & polite, the hostess went around dancing Thai style & the ambience and lighting pretty unique to the place. Wonderful morning well spent on classy Dempsey Hill
5
Initially expected a tourist-themed dinner, based on affiliation with Jim Thompson. But the dinner and experience was a pleasant upscale surprise. The quality of the food was outstanding; the service attentive without being pretentious; and the setting (both inside and outside) makes it perfect. A Singapore favorite for me
3
The building is beautiful and the staff is wonderful. The service is the best thing about Jim Thompson...and the Thai dancers. I feel that the food for the price is just average. You can get GREAT Thai food in Singapore for less than half the price. What you are paying for is the atmosphere. We will go back for drinks on the terrace outside for sure.On a side not the bathrooms are a bit of a journey
5
While the ambience takes top honors, the food is true to Thai standards. The service was great as well. While they could not get us a cake, they made up with a custom one using fruits that looked just like a cake..Would definitely recommend the place
5
The restaurant is in a heritage property with high ceilings and lot of chandeliers. Thai dancers come regularly which adds to the charm and ambience. It is located on Dempsey hill and you would not feel you are in the city when you enter the area. We were very happy to see a full vegetarian menu and tried mango salad, Khao phod, Phad Thai noodles, Red curry and Steamed Rice. All the dishes were very nice. If you like Thai food it is a must go place
2
If you love Thai food, it’s hard to suppress a chronic rumble of disappointment at finding that an iconic name like Jim Thompson can fare so poorly.I was really looking forward to my lunch – expectations were high but realistic. Without trying to sound arrogant, I am familar with top end restaurants and not unfairly measuring my experience against unequally rated restaurants. What a disappointment. The food lacks balance and is poorly seasoned.This place is pleasant enough as a family-friendly restaurant but I would expect better quality food for somewhere with Jim Thompson’s name attached to it. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
4
It was dinner before my son enlisted and we were glad we choose Jim Thomson! Decor was chic, service was excellent and food was fabulous! Definitely heading back!
5
Super ambiance, service and food. A must while in Singapore. Try a little of everything. Sharing always works.
5
I visited this restaurant with my family . We all love Thai cuisine and I would like to share that this place didn't disappoint us. It's a fine dining restaurant with great ambience, inside and outside. The quality of food and service is par excellence. The green curry and olive rice was a big hit !! Overall , a lovely evening spent !!
4
We were looking for a special venue for dinner and Jim Thompson didn't disappoint. The venue is beautifully decorated inside and out and the service and welcome impeccable. The recreation of the old building into a restaurant is actually a work of art. It is probably worth looking into the history of Dempsey Hill and also Jim Thompson himself to fully enjoy the environment. I thought the food was well priced for a beautiful venue. The wine was particularly good and the food was what you would expect from most Thai restaurants.
4
My first visit as I've heard a lot of good reviews about this restaurant. As expected, food and services were great. The servers were friendly, food was served promptly and taste wise was just excellent. Definitely worth the trip and will return to try other dishes
5
It was my husbands birthday so we decided to try jim Thompson for dinner . It had the best Thai foo with beautiful environment . The food was very rasht with very good presentation . On TOP of that 2 Thai girls walked down the tables with elegant dthai dance steps .they cam 3 times with different get ups and were polite to be photographed . An excellent evening to cherish 
3
Went there with colleagues for dinner as the local colleagues said this is an authentic Thai cuisine restaurant. It was, up to a point but not totally. The food was not as tasty as in Thailand and not as spicy. Looks like the dished were toned down for non-Thai foreigners :-)
5
If you like Thai food, you cannot miss this place. The entire experience of dinning at Jim Thompsons is simply amazing. They have enough vegetarian options as well. The tom yum soup is very flavourful . the green curry along with olive rice is a really nice combination to try. They have an elaborate wine menu .
3
Big group booked for evening meal, nice restaurant and staff very welcoming. Decedent selection wine and beers bud food pretty average. Starter combo plater average and Luke warm. Yellow chicken curry very nice bur small portion, it was ok but expensive, nothing to make it stand ou
2
Building is nice, Dempsey a great location, food comes quickly -- that's the good side.Food comes quickly because its been kept warm (heat lamp?) for some time.Food is uninteresting, prices are high.Every 15 min or so in evening a couple of women in dance costumes parade through -- to amuse the tourists.There are so many better places in Dempsey, let alone in Singapore -- why bother with this one
5
Very sophisticated Thai food at great location in great Thai style cottage-like building. Highly recommended to try their Ton Yam soap. Not a very cheap restaurant but good for special occasions. Dinning outside terrace is recommended when it is not too hot.
いつも特別な時に利用させていただいています。色々な人と連れていくなどもしましたがタイの雰囲気の建物や洗練されたタイ料理とお店の方達のサービスに満足しております。価格としてはそれなりにするレストランではすが(スープ、飲み物、前菜、グリーンカレー、デザートなどで恐らく1人$80位でしょうか)、ちょっといい時に、リラックスして食事をしたい時に本当にいいレストランです。
4
Very good Thai food that is one of the more authentic places you will be able to get Thai food in Singapore. Located in the Dempsey area you can sit both inside or outdoors. Nice ambiance and good staff.
5
I really liked the high ceilings which makes the place really nice. It wasn't crowded so we could have decent conversations. The menu was extensive so we had to get help with some recommendations; food was very nice. The staff was also polite.
3
Went there for a birthday celebration. But food fell short. Pandas wrapped chicken was dry and seafood was not fresh.
4
Enjoyed a beautiful and, most important, tasty dinner. Staff is friendly and you can ask for less spicy (sorry, I'm European). Nice thai dansers during the evening. For Singapore standard it's decently priced and value for money
4
Very nice dining environment and food is good. Abit pricey though. Will come back again for next gathering :).
4
It was good but the Pad Thai wasn't the best.. The portions are kind of small though but the food was good
4
Good Thai food with excellent service and some interesting Thai Salads and Prawn Dishes which are very good. Located in an old building in Dempsey Hill with some Thai Dancers performing during dinner.
5
We had a family dinner of Thai food and everything was simply excellent, starting from the food taste and service and hospitality. It was my wife's birthday and the staff sang a beautiful happy birthday song and surprised us.It is advisable to make reservations as the place is very popular both among locals and expatriates.We will definitely visit again and all of us loved the experience
5
Went for a birthday celebration with the family. Parents are vegetarian - and they have an exhaustive veg menu. I can safely say that I've not had veg thai food like this before. Overall ambience was excellent - large indoor and outdoor seating areas and actually quite silent. Service was fantastic. On knowing that it was a bday, the entire crew did a very nice and surprising singing session as well. Highly recommended
5
One of the best Thai I ever had , great food , great set up , great menu , everything was spot on and really really good , very much impressed
5
Been as a couple, a family and a group of friends and this place doesn't disappoint. Lovely setting and atmosphere and most of all, amazing food. 5*.
4
The restaurant is beautifully laid out. We sat outside and enjoyed the cultural dances as well. The ambience is good, and the food is also excellent. Definitely a must visit. Though it is expensive.
4
Live cin Singapore for 5 years and frequently went to this restaurant. Good food, very nice decor and absolutely fantastic Negronis made by the bartender.
5
Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Food is superb and the atmosphere great. A bit pricey for Thai food but worth the investment
5
As we live in Singapore, we have explored myriads of cuisines in different restaurants, but in the field for Thai food, this was definitely a topper. Jim Thompson offers lovely Thai food in a nice atmosphere. As a vegetarian family, our favorites are the spring rolls, the Thai curry, the corn cakes and the papaya salad. The food is nice is spicy with a mix of vegetables and not too oily. The service is very nice and the atmosphere is identical to a Thai one. This is surely a must do for Thai food in Singapore
5
Went there for dinner with family. Starting with a warm, hospitable and welcoming Thai reception, the usher efficiently led us to our reserved table. The service was impeccable- timely and attentive. The timeliness of food delivery was great. The quality was great...all in all a great place- highly recommended
4
This restaurant was one of the best experience with Thai Cuisine so far with great options for vegetarians. Housed in colonial era building with interiors and waitresses giving an absolute "Sawadee kha" experience. Food was great, highlight being the Tom Yum soup which both me and wife loved
5
Ordered the Huai Sauvignon Blanc 2010 - pleasant and reviving. For Starters we had the accompanying: - Tom Kha Gai - soup was simply extraordinary and me and my wife shared one order as it was simply enough. - Tom Yam Goong - My child adored this despite the fact that we was sweating because of the spice. - Thompson Garee Pup - the Samosa was not quite the same as what we've tried before. The sauce was great. - Assorted Satay Set - Nicely displayed. The chicken and beef satay were heavenly. The green mango serving of mixed greens that accompanied it was great. For our own Mains we had: - Green Chicken Curry - Khao Phad Nam Lieb - fried rice with black olives- Khao Phad Sappalot Goong Sod - Pineapple browned rice with prawns. We preferred this as compared to the one with the dark olives. - Nueng Manao - steamed ocean bass. Interior design was extraordinary and I would trust that during the evening the establishment will be incredible. From the time we entered the till we exited (2.5 hours) we all had a very lovely experience especially with the wonderful supervision of our very attentive waitress Lorna.Even though the restaurant was sort of far for us tourist to reach I would still recommend this restaurant
4
We visited the restaurant with friends on a Sunday evening. Actually the terrace has a beautifully relaxing setting and it is probably one of the better outdoor dining options in Singapore. One will find all the classic Thai dishes on the menu complemented with a number of less known , yet delicious dishes. Beside the excellent taste a lot of attention goes to the presentation of the dishes The place itself has a nice and peaceful atmosphere with traditional Thai furniture and this without being kitschy. Finally the service. The Thai staff is very welcoming , friendly with a big smile ... as you would expect in traditional Thai restaurant. I would really recommend this place , it is even much better than the Jim Thompson restaurant in Bangko
4
I have been there for business dinner, very nice place, resturant staff were friendly, food was good, not so spicy as compared to authentic thai food
Place is not close to public transport and an expensive place
5
Now I'm going to say the meals were a little on the pricey use but they were worth it. We have eaten a lot of Thai food and this was delicious. Nice atmosphere and good service.
4
Had a lovely meal here if you like spicy hot food you can't go wrong. Beautiful surroundings. Dancers good.
5
Just one word. Outstanding!
Pretty much sums up our experience at this place. Lives up to its reputation. It is a MUST visit whenever in Singapore.
Try anything from their menu. I promise it'll leave you amazed.
4
Great place very original and smart; typical of Thaïland. We had a diner there (inside of the restaurant with fresh air, but there is a very nice terrace) with 8 people and booked à little bit of every dishes in order to taste. The good was excellent and the drinks (Chardonnay and good cocktails) were very good as well. Exactly what we had expected even more fine and the building itself + decoration very nice. We recommand this place
5
a great and heady mix of authentic and exotic Thai cuisine,set in a beautiful and elegant ambience, makes for a treat... the place has a quaint look and feel, the food is awesome, and the ambience is lovely ... quiet as it is nestled in an old cottage, yet has a good buzz to it ... the thai cultural dancers add to the warmth and fee .. overall well worth and a great experienc
3
My experience at Jim Thomson was average at best. I had scheduled to arrange a special birthday celebration for my fiance and was hoping for a memorable time. Despite requesting for a more private dining area and making a reservation earlier on, we were given a table in an open area surrounded by other tables. Perhaps the most disspappointing aspect was the promptness of the service staff to take orders, deliver food. The cake that was provided for the Birthday tasted stale and not fresh. The only highlight was the quality of the main dishes served. The Tom Yum Goong soup and the basil chicken was outstanding and tasted exceptionally good. I certainly hope there can be more congruence with being a top-class thai restaurant. Expectations are high for the Jim Thomson experience
5
We've been to Jim Thompson at Dempsey several times now and always have a great time, what keeps us coming back is the consistent quality of the food, the amazing service, and the very relaxed colonial style surrounds that is Dempsey Hill. It is by no-means the cheapest Thai food in Singapore, in fact, when you add in a few house cocktails, or a bottle of wine, then the meal very quickly becomes one of the more expensive you can have in Dempsey, and that's saying something!What they do very very well though, is great Thai food cooked with the best ingredients available. It's hard to go past the steamed sea bass in ginger, the wok-tossed broccoli and prawns, a traditional curry, or their amazing version of the humble spring roll (both fresh or fried are terrific). There hasn't been a single menu item that we haven't liked in 2 years and multiple visits. We take visitors to Singapore here when we want a relaxed, yet up market, dining experience away from the typical tourist traps around the marina and the various quays. It's a pleasant change for all and most newcomers are surprised that Dempsey Hill exists so close to everything else.
5
We specifically selected this restaurant in advance of our trip to Singapore to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday and we are both very glad we did! Probably the best Thai dining experience we'd ever had outside Thailand. Wonderful staff, beautifully dressed in traditional outfits, stunning décor and great service. The food was superb, traditional Thai dishes elevated up a level. It's a special place, includes Thai dancers but done very tastefully. At the end of our dinner, the staff brought out a birthday fruit platter with candle and all and sang to him, it made his night, thanks to all the staff there who helped make his birthday so special. We enjoyed it so much, we booked in again before flying back out to Dubai. Easily the best dining experience of our entire trip

This was our second visit to Jim Thomson in Dempsey Hill, a Thai restaurant at the higher end of the spectrum. The interior is beautifully decorated as you would expect from a company that also deals in fabrics, with lovely lighting treatments at either end of the the long tall heritage building.The food is good too, although not the best Thai I have ever eaten, the spring rolls were a little greasy and the curry a little flat in it's flavours, however the rice paper rolls were delicious as were the prawn cakes. The staff were efficient and charming throughout
5
Went with a group and enjoyed drinks in the garden before entering the beautifully restored old barracks. Great ambience and the food was excellent. As with any wine in Singapore it is very expensive but food prices good.
5
Delicious food,attentive staff and a most memorable venue, we had a great night the food was both tasty and beautifully presented
3
It has Thai silks and dancing girls. Hostesses and servers in (what we'd like to think are) traditional costume. A feast for the eyes. But not so much for the palate. The food wasn't bad. It just wasn't great.
4
Great nature around , peaceful terrace friendly staff. Food is really good but sophisticated. It's not really fine dining place.
5
My wife and I were looking to reward the two friends who volunteered to take a morning of their time to witness our signatures on legal papers at the US Embassy. Jim Thompson is a 7 minute walk away and was outstanding. The Thai sets were wonderful with several great options. One friend is strict vegetarian and had a delightful lunch with some minimal advice from our server. The food is not inexpensive but we left both physically and emotionally re-charged for the rest of the day. I will put this on my repeat destination list when I am fancying great Thai
5
The restaurant is within part of the beautiful old barracks which have been tastefully given a Thai makeover, service is excellent, attentive without being intrusive which I think is a difficult balance to strike. Cocktails were fab, freshly made without the sickly sweet prepacked mixture a lot of places use.And then the food ! A mixed platter of starters just disappeared, every one was a delight with wonderful well balanced flavours, each main course also hit the mark with my Thai red curry duck just amazing. Portions sizes were generous with none of our party able to order desert, but the ones I saw fellow diners eating looked superb. An excellent experience all round, highly recommended
4
The restaurant is situated close to the botanical gardens and in what appears to be an old colonial garden. The greeting at the door is very welcoming. Our table was close to the entrance but since there are several parts to the dining area we weren't subject to the usual traffic that this incurs. I had a banana and salted peanut drink and Mrs Vicar had the Mango Tango, both non alcoholic but full of flavour. The mixed starter was very colourful and consisted of prawn, chicken and something I couldn't work out but very tasty. For mains we both had the soft shell crab. The indication from our waitress was that it could be quite hot, so not knowing what to expect we ordered I ordered a mild version. This was probably a mistake since I felt it could do with a little more kick. I've yet to come across any restaurant that can beat the soft shell crab at Pham Sushi n the Barbican in London. With a little more spice this would have matched it. I also ordered the pineapple rice which was a meal in itself, served up in half a pineapple with large prawns and pineapple chunks amongst it. Mrs Vicar had a Thai rice which went well with the crab. Both of us were stuffed so couldn't sample the desert, unlike our friends who had a rice based desert which was declared delicious. The service was very good and we never felt hurried. The banquette seating on my side of the table may have become a little uncomfortable if we'd have stayed much longer, so if you're taller than 6ft it might be best to choose a regular chair.All in all a very good dining experience but cheap it isn't as you pay for what you get, a very good experience
5
The title says it all! The food here was aromatic and delicious, the service was impeccable and the ambience was a generous mix of modern and cultural.The Thai green curry and the water chestnut in the end were fabulous! Also, this is also one of the few restaurants that actually has 2 menus - one for vegetarians and the other for non vegetarians . By far, this is one of the best Thai fine dining restaurants in Singapore !
3
We went there to celebrate our daughter's birthday.The ambience and service was very good, and they surprise our daughter with a fruit platter and the whole service staff came and sang a nice tune of happy birthday song. Very nice touch though I wish I could say more good things about the food but we have eaten better ones
2
My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at Jim Thompson at Dempsey Hill. The restaurant space is absolutely beautiful. However, the drinks, food, and service did not match the location or brand promise at all. The service was slow and indifferent. The drinks had no discernible alcohol. The food was average at best. There are far too many great Thai restaurants, at any price point, in Singapore and elsewhere, don't bother going to this one
5
Finest place. Ordered for pat thai, red curry, not to miss the mango with coconut ice cream.
Perfect ambiance, great location, helpful staff.
Do not miss this at any cost. It is just too good.
5
Splendid building,nice historical area and the most superb Thai resturant serving exquisite food served by the the most likeable staff I've come across in any resturant in many visited countries. Treat yourself and enjoy.
5
Recommend the buffet on Sunday. Food is very good, set up is nice, service can be slow/on unfriendly side. Go for the coconut ice cream as desert. Really good.
5
Enjoyed the Sunday lunch with friends (they served buffet on Sunday's) and the menu is not that extensive but they are quite fast in replenishing. They also have unlimited order on some of the menu and all were good. The place was very nice, old building decorated Thai style.You should try it
2
I think this restaurant must be surviving on foreign travelers that are having it recommended by Hotel Concierges. While our appetizer was good, my stir fry was the worst Thai food I have ever have. There was absolutely zero flavor/spice. I was extremely disappointed. For the price and the recommendation from the hotel I had high expectations and was I disappointed. While the restaurant has a beautiful interior I don't go to a restaurant for the interior I go for the food. If you want Thai food go elsewhere, eat better and for less
5
Excellent, excellent Thai food. Though I had driven past this restaurant on Dempsey Hill several times, I had somehow never ended up trying it, as it was set a bit away from the main drag. It turned out to be great dinner when I was invited here recently. Even some Thai staples that I normally avoid (pad thai, green curry chicken) had been ordered by our hosts and even these generic dishes turned out to be quite good (the pad thai, in particular, was not very peanut-y). Just about every dish was fantastic! I am going back again
4
this is what I liked about this place - Food: nice tasty food, for both veg and non vegetarians. The mock meat was very interesting. We had some mushroom dish was pretty good. There was limited wine options that were actually available.Ambiance: Music was a bit off but the space and decor was greatWhat I didnt like - Better advice on how much we should be ordering- we got no help on this from the servers. Sometimes the customers cant gauge if the food will be more than enough
5
My first visit here and on arrival I wondered whether the food could possibly match the fabulous interior.The restaurant is set inside a fabulous high celinged dining room with the principle area open plan beyond which is a section of discretely partioned tables offering a romantic setting.The food was impeccable, deliciously tasty and perfectly cooked with crunchy prawns and crisp vegetables, all spices enough without disguising the taste.The service was charming, my vodka tonic came initially with soda water, this happens frequently in Asia but who cares, I certainly didn't and it was immediately replaced.A wonderful evening
3
Not going to say too much about this. The place is highly recommended for those who seek for great Thai food and interior inspirations. Just one thing that this restaurant needs to improve is the quality of the staff. One of the staff that served us was not so kind. I am an interior designer and I do hunt for great interior inspiration everywhere I go. When I visited this place to have dinner, I do take several photos of the interiors, unfortunately some of the staffs were giving unpleasant face expressions. Thats all what I need to review on this reataurant. Apart from the quality of the service, the rest was great. Very recommended
5
I ate here about 3 years ago and did not enjoy it. I went back hesitantly and they completely blew my mind. The food is amazing, fresh and tasty. Good service. For Thai food it is the best I have eaten in Singapore.Decent wine list too.They have a vegetarian menu and veggie food cooked separately which is a huge plus for us
4
On a great location with a nice terrace this place serves great Thai food.
Decent price setting for Singapore and the usual quick service.
It also has dancers performing to provide some entertainment.
5
We only tried their dessert and drinks and it was good. Mango sticky rice serves in a big portion, but the rice was too sweet for me.
4
Good Thai food in a beautiful setting if you sit inside. Outside is pleasant enough but the service slower. The overall price is expensive for what it is.
5
We loved the food here.. Extensive vegetarian options .. The food was nice and the setting lovely ... Since we are from india we loved the flavours
5
The food was great and the service was quick, so you weren't left waiting long. Also, they had the best coconut I've ever had.
5
The food here is great, top notch, with a price to match. The building is a renovated barracks which is very unique structurally. Ladies dancing traditional Thai dance with full garb adds to the experience
5
Extensive menu with plenty of packaged option as well as a la carte. Excellent food, excellent wine list. Excellent cocktails and last but not least excellent professional friendly service.All your favourites of Thai cuisine are here. sit inside or outside good ambience in both locations. for just a couple, i think inside is nice. If you are six or more take your pick if you can handle the heat.The locals use it but for special occassions as it is priced at the high end of the market.Great night and I will be back.
4
Convenient location at Dempsey. The service was swift as my guests had just landed from overseas and hungry. We ordered a variety of appetizers, Tom yam soup and several dishes for sharing. Good flavors and freshness. Not overpowering spices and went well with two bottles of Chardonnay. Will return.
5
One of the nicest and unpretentious restaurants in Singapore. Lovely, relaxed interior, top service and scent of basil and lemon grass from the moment you enter the building. We've tried five different dishes, they were fragrant, fresh and spicy, absolutely fantastic. Generous portions as well. I recommend this place both for larger groups and romantic dinners for two. Will definitely come back
4
Lovely lunch for mothers day. We had the lunch buffet, which also comes with extra food that can be ordered that is not on the buffet table. They cater for those who do not like their food too spicy, as well as a selection of Western food. From my perspective, the curries could have been more spicy. Note that buffet is not as big as a hotel buffet, and could be considered by some as expensive at $68++ for the non alcoholic option
3
I love Thai flavours. So this place has been on my hit list for a long while. One doesn't associate Jim Thompson with good food. Ambience. Fabulous. Service. Outstanding. Food. Average. I hate settling for average.
4
We delayed going Tim Thompson because of ta mixed reviews from friends. However I regret not going sooner.
The food is amazing the service is great and the restaurant inside is beautiful.
It's an all rounder. Great place to take guests also.
Definitely be back.
4
Nice place where to share a dinner with friends, family or for business as well. The food was simply good and fresh. Thai girls welcome you dancing through the tables. Absolutely Thai taste - Strongly recommended!
5
Excellent first class service and nice ambience, the food is value for money and very reasonably priced.
5
Beautiful setting & amazing food. Wine a little pricey, but a great experience overall, will definitely go back.
5
Four of us for dinner. Serive was great and food was excellent. Catered very well for the vegetarians in the group. Food is of a high standard.
4
It was my 2nd time dining in this restaurant, I love the foods here, interior looks elegant, spacious alfresco, pleasant staffs and got dancers gracefully dancing around with their big smiles..
5
Jim Thompson delivered a Thai experience that can only be described as sensational. The food was mouth watering to the last fork full. At the higher end of the price range, $800 for 4 of us including a bottle of wine & 6 GnT's. This was an experience to savor and was worth the spend for catching up with great friends we haven't seen for years from New Zealand. Not the most authentic Thai restaurant name, but the food is. Excellent.
5
Was in Dempsey Hill for other activities with children but my wife and I are Thai Food fans, and we passed this, turned the car around parked and had to go in and try it. It was a great lunch experience, the restaurant is cool, elegant in a Thai way, and we were shown a table quickly (had no booking so they accommodated us- two adults two 17 month infants needing baby seats). Great service, and we ordered the two different individual set meals as there was a range of things we could share- all were excellent. My wife chose a glass of champagne, I had a beer and we ordered extra rice and fed our twins from a range of different dishes, which they also loved. Bill was reasonable for the quality of food we had, but I did get to glance at the a-la-carte for the evening and suspect it could be pricier for dinners
5
I love Thai food, and this is the best I've ever had. Fresh ingredients, lots of variety, a lush and upscale setting and impeccable service. There was even an authentic Thai dancer roaming between the tables while we ate. A feast for the eyes as well as for the stomach. Be aware that this won't be a cheap meal, but you will never forget it
5
Nothing to say about the food, just perfect as you'd like it to be ... They serve a special version of bloody marry, spicy as hell, but very tasty, give it a try!
5
the food is classic thai, with so many choices.
a nice looking place.
price is a little high, service not so warm
5
Just really good Thai food in great original setting (old converted church) buy also outdoor area!
Good space for quiet or group.
4
Good Thai food (without being the real thai taste) in a very nice place.
Now this is really a place for foreigners and the final bill is always pricey
5
Amazing. Good food. Great atmosphere. Service was perfect. No problems getting in. The prawns were cooked just right.
4
This is one of my "go to" places in Singapore. Always has very good food and service, and the building always impresses my guests.
3
The ambience was great.The staff who were mainly Thai were friendly and smiled a lot.For a company of three I asked the waitress who took the order of I should order the small or large portion of the yellow chicken curry.Knowing that I already ordered Sukhothai entree set, chicken pad mamuang and mixed vegetables with mushroom in oyster sauce, she said the bigger one because my parents and I were "family"."Family" is designed for two parents and three teenagers with plenty of chicken!A good waiter should know how to give good advice.The manager was quick in service recovery but I hope they invest more time in staff training
5
Dinner with friends, excellent selection of food from starters to desserts. Service was also quite good. The location presents an impressive setting as do the staff who welcome and entertain via traditional attire, greeting and dancing.Shared starter set and variety of mains as well as desserts were truly enjoyed by all, as was the selection of drinks and wines.Certainly priced to impress as well, but was well worth the money spent
3
Lovely setting on a hill . Attentive service and reasonable prices but not exceptional. We ordered specialty cocktails while we looked at the menu. The drinks were really good.Started with golden Triangle set of appetizers. The appetizers were good. Chicken wings were huge double size tasty wings. Spring rolls, mango salad and prawn cakes were equally good‎.The mains were disappointing. Pad Thai was tasteless, green curry with chicken was bland with no basil flavor and the signature $48 deep fried fish was dried out. The only main that was ok was a prawn dish with spicy sauce. Afterr dinner and the plates cleared  We were told that we could not order dessert because the kitchen had closed at 10pm. IT was in fact a little past ten.. it might have been nice if they had told us when we ordered our meal. A reasonably priced meal but Nothing more than an average meal except the settin
1
This is a Thai-themed restaurant that should be avoided at all costs.It is run like a theme park attraction so you get pointless entertainment terrible food and service which is some times overtly hostile.The food is all dumbed down for Western palates and consists of poor quality ingredients badly cooked and presented in an absurd way.The actual premises are ok in a kitsch kind of way but really this a place no real Thai would ever visit.It is also wildly overpriced
5
My Friends had taken me to this local favourites, i liked the food specially the papaya salad. Dessert Red Ruby and Coconut Ice cream was the best.
5
Came here without expectations and was pleasantly surprised throughout the entire dinner! The friendly staff, great drinks and delicious dishes!
5
We were looking for a good Thai resturant in Singapore and Jim Thompson is definitely up there in terms of ambience and quality of food. We ordered Tom Yam and Prawn cakes as starters and Green Curry, Pad Thai and Beef in Black Pepper sauce. All of the dishes were very well prepared and have distinct taste. Service was also par excellence. Highly recommended..
2
Given the excellent reviews, I tool an important out of town visitor to Jim Thompson. As we entered, I got the sense that this is a place trying to look authentic but which probably isn't in reality. I was right - the food was just awful. My tom yum soup was practically tasteless. The pomelo salad was OK, but the main curry seemed like a bunch of vegetables dumped in a sauce that was sitting for hours. I can't believe there was a thick layer of oil in my Thai curry. The vegetables in the curry were unevenly cooked - some were cold and others were scalding. I was shocked.Yes, this place has a good ambience. If you only care about the ambience, then come here. If you care about having good Thai food, avoid this place at all costs
4
This was a fantastic restaurant to have a dinner gathering for a bunch of 10. Food was very good quality traditional Thai cuisine. The food price is on the high side, however considering the classy set up of the table, the beauty of the restaurant, the service and the ambiance overall, it it worth every penny. The entire experience was magical and we will definitely be back.There was a mention from one of us that a friend was celebrating his birthday and the staff went all out to organised dessert with a candle for him, even though this was not informed to the staff before hand, when we made the reservation. We would like to thank the staff for being so considerate
4
I have driven past this restaurant many times when I visit Dempsey Hill.I had a dinner gathering here recently with some friends.The restaurant is set in a refurbished building that was once used as an army barrack.There is a nice outdoor wooden deck where you can sit al fresco with a mid-sized water feature. You can also dine indoors in air-conditioned comfort. I like the tall ceilings in the restaurant. There are also greeters who are dressed in traditional Thai costumes to welcome you to the restaurant. The greeters later go around the restaurant doing a slow Thai dance while walking, which adds to the charm of the restaurant.To start, I ordered the Thompson Mojito: $28. It had lemongrass infused vodka, fresh lemongrass, fresh mint, fresh lime, lemongrass syrup and bitter lemon. Nice and refreshing! Here are the food highlights of my meal:- Appetisers to share. This is the Sukhothai Set, which costs $44 for 3 pax.-- Curried fish cakes with chilli sauce with crushed peanuts and cucumber-- Deep-fried prawn wrapped in rice paper and yellow egg noodles, served with chilli-plum sauce-- Marinated chicken wrapped in pandan leaves: Big piece of meat. The Jim Thomson special dip was a sweet dark sauce, which is nice.-- Green mango salad: Love the chili-lime dressing. This was good, something unique, compared to the usual Thai papaya salad.- Tom Yam Goong: Hot and sour prawns soup with mushroom, galangal, lemongrass, shallots and bird's eye chilli. This single portion costs $24. Prawns were fresh and succulent.- I will remember this for a long time... This is Khao Phad Sappalot Goong Sod: Pineapple fried rice with prawns, onions and black raisin. $22. It reminds of very good chicken rice, where each individual grain of rice stands apart from the others and does not clump together at all, unlike most pineapple rice I've had before. To add icing, the rice was fragrant too. Very well-done! - Stir-fried morning glory with garlic, bird's eye chillies in a yellow bean and oyster sauce. Essentially, the vegetable is more commonly known locally as 'Kang Kong'. Boy, it was spicy, thanks to the chillies!- Green chicken curry with Thai eggplants and sweet basil leaves. Curry was flavorful, but the chicken was not cooked long enough in the curry to absorb the flavors though.- Phad Graprow Neau: Stir-fried beef tenderloin with garlic, bird's eye chilies and holy basil. The holy basil leaves on the top were nice, not too much taste of herbs. - Nueng Manao - Steamed Seabass with garlic-chilli-lime sauce. What I like is the fish has been deboned, so you just have to scoop up the fish and sauce with your spoon without having to worry about any bones! - Ice cream Kati: Classic Thai coconut ice cream served in a coconut shell. Its was nice to scoop the soft flesh of the coconut and eat it with the coconut ice cream.- Khao Niow Ma-Moung: Fragrant yellow mango with sticky rice kissed with sweet, rich coconut milk. Would have preferred the mangoes to be sweeter. To end the meal, I had the Jim Thompson Cooler: Gin, fresh lime juice, homemade ginger syrup, fresh mint leaf and ginger ale. Overall, a good Thai meal and itâ€™s a nice charming place for entertaining guests and friends

I took my family for a dinner to Jim thomson... it was a mixed experience....# ambience is excellent, service is attentive# vegetarian menu is extensive# food taste is average at best - there are other thai restaurants in singapore with much better tasting thai food. starters were oily (deep fried does not necessarily have to be oily when served).
4
You will be struck by the decor when you arrive at Jim Thompson's. It seems to be a converted church with vast vaulted ceilings and elegant partitions. The table decoration and abundant artwork compliments the architecture. The long list of cocktails are an inviting way to start your evening. The food was a little less impressive. Most of the dishes were fresh and flavoursome as you would expect from a Thai restaurant but it was let down by overlooked prawns in the broccoli dish. Presentation was fantastic and we were impressed by the genuine Thai service. Our daughter loved the Thai dancers who glided past every hour or so. We will be coming back I suspect..
4
Jim Thompson is located on Dempsey hill, a trendy ex-pat area of the city suburbs that uses an old garrison to house various shops and restaurants. This restaurant is in a converted barracks which has been turned into a stunningly spacious restaurant, with lovely high ceilings. There is also an outdoor area.As we visited with friends who had been previously been before we let them do the ordering, so we had a mixed selection of starters and a green and red curry with steamed rice as main courses. All the food was delicious and served by attentive staff. The only downside of the whole experience was that to reach the bathrooms you have to go outside and down a passage way to a rather dimly lit cloakroom - a bit of a let down after the rest of the experience
5
Grab a cab and head to this wonderful back-in-the-day venue for a wonderful luxurious meal. Yes, it will take a bite out of your budget but it's definitely an experience and the food is delicious. Many vegetarian choices and accommodated for. Drinks are expensive to have a few before you grab that cab. But they are unique and must have at least one here
4
from the entrance to the restaurant decoration, to teh service everything will take you back to the old charm of Royal Thailand.
The food presentation and , the taste are very authentic..
One of hte best Thai restaurant in Asia.
4
Being a veggie was bit worried but it was unfounded..they had a separate veg menu with lot of choices and food turned out to be great. Decent service. Worth a visit.
4
The food were excellent. But a bit shocked that at the price of drinks. Cocktails are over on average 23 Sin dollars. Even the soft drinks are pricy. Didn't expect this kind of price except in hotels.
4
Lovely venue with high ceilings and Thai artefacts. Food good but not very different from a local High St Thai in the UK. And £100 for two of us.. and the only booze was one beer.
3
My Husband and I have visited this restaurant many times, the good is usually excellent, last night however, was a little disappointing. We ordered the Golden Triangle mixed starter, fresh prawn spring rolls followed by Pad Gra Pow ( beef with Thai basil). The starters were great. We advised the waitress that the beef dish was not authentic as it had far too many mushrooms and not enough beef. We told her we had recently visited Thailand and had the dish several times and the beef had been plentiful. Her response was that beef is more expensive in Singapore- not a very satisfactory answer!!! We will stick to the Thai red curry with beef for future visits, as that is always delicious and served with lots of beef.
3
Food was very average. We ordered the vegetarian massaman curry, some fresh spring rolls and a my colleagues ate a prawn dish. Nothing special. While the serving staff were very nice, the lady usher at the entrance was rude and indifferent. The coconut ice cream dessert was nice, while the red ruby dessert was again very average. Ambience alone does not make up for the money spent.
3
I have now frequented the Jim Thompson restaurant twice and the experience is very consistent!Great location, fantastic ambience, good service and quite authentic Thai food served!All dishes served are quite local and original, that is if you request the food to be 'Thai authentic', then the dishes which are supposed to be spicy hot, needs to come with a bit more of a kick!Finally I would be happy to rate the food and value at Jim Thompson a double 5' score, if it wasn't because of the MSG overdose, which ruins the overall meal experience.I had exactly the same experience from my two visits (different dishes ordered!), leaving the restaurant with an extreme dry mouth and with this funny MSG after taste, which lasted for a couple of hours.For a Thai 'fine dining' place like Jim Thompson, it is a disappointment, that the chefs in the kitchen have to rely on MSG in such high concentrations, when other premium Thai restaurants can do without and provide just as tasty and authentic dishes.Jim Thompson, please skip the MSG and go for a double 5' score
3
The design of the place have made us feel like we are in Thailand. Not sure if it was due to the weather, it was quite warm and stuffy when in the restaurant. Their Tom yam goong was quite good as for the rest including the desserts were average. Quite pricy too
2
Visited there for a business lunch, being a vegetarian, I opt for veggies dishes, but when I took a bite of "vegetable spring roll", it has a minced meet inside.. they never mention it on the name plate.. they simply mentioned it a vegetable roll.. like wise the "green mango salad" .. it has dried shrip and oyester sauce its seems.. they really dont mention what all are inside that dish.. they mentioned in their menu but not really on table.. it is very disappointing. being a business lunch, they arranged a buffet for us separately.. but in the name plates.. they never mentioned .. Never visit again
3
Was there for the second time and again I have to say that the atmosphere is really great. Whether it is in the open or inside the restaurant - really good. Unfortunately the staff was kind of mentally absent, or rather disinterested. Food was good, large quantities. I feel it is overpriced
3
The food here is lovely. Fresh, well prepared and delivered promptly. Very expensive. And quite a fuss when we went to pay. Insisted they only took cash or AMEX. We only had Visa and problem seem to disappear.
2
Expensive, remote, fast food feeling. They asked 4 times if we were ready to pay, WC not clean. Chopstick only brought when asked and bad quality. Stay away!
4
I came here for a dinner gathering. We really love the romantic ambience, warm service and quality Thai dishes!
4
Very nice restaurant with a good ambiance. The food was well cooked and had a lot flavor. The device was impeccable and we were never wanting for anything. I will be back.
4
truly exceptional dining in a very nice atmosphere; go to one of the bars at Dempsey hill afterwards.
5
My wife and I visited this restaurant on the back of a recommendation. It is slightly out of town and we took a taxi on a Friday night....so it took longer than expected but we should left earlier.Dempsey Hill is an ex-military garrison so many of the buildings reflect this. Jim Thompson's is a lovely large traditional build that has had a simple layer of Thai decor added to it inside, with additional outdoor seating. Lovely welcome and swift seating followed by aperitif's.We absolutely loved the way the disabled were served, the flavours of the food in particular were awesome with enough chilli but not so much it dominates the meal. Really perfect balance of tastes, texture and colour. Lovely.Two gorgeous traditionally dressed Thai girls danced around the tables similar to 'The King and I' - really sweet.If you want some seriously authentic Thai food in your visit to Singapore then I would highly recommend this venue. Would be excellent for larger groups as well.Enjoy!
4
My wife brought me here for a surprise birthday dinner as she knows that I am a Thai food lover. And I wasn't disappointed.Reservations was easy & smooth.Upon arrival we were warmly greeted & seated at a nice quiet corner.The place was beautiful with traditional Thai artifacts & artwork all around.The settings/ambience was also nice & romantic.Service was fast & friendly.Food was very good & filling.As it was my birthday, the staffs surprised me with a fruit birthday platter while singing to us.It is a bit pricey but for the ambience, food & service , well worth it
5
The Dempsey Road area is lush and consists of former army baracks that were turned into trendy restaurants and wine bars some years ago. A smart decision as this has added a welcome option to residents and visitors wishing to experience so time out in Singapore's tropical landscape where it still exists. Jim Thompson offers a lovely setting and includes a spacious outside seating area that is highly attractive to evening diners. Service is rather authentic Thai, and so is the food. Mildly spiced for the non-Thai patrons, it offers full flavors and rounds off an experience that is not only just about good food. Highly recommended but pricey, as are many other restaurants in the Citystate.
3
Celebrated my dad in law's birthday on 25 oct. The 16 of us were seated on a long table. We tried most of the familiar favourites which included tomyam, green curry, pandan chicken, fish cakes, phadthai, omelette, beef, pork, vegetables, 2 types of fried rice, vermicelli, deep fried fish and lemon grass sea bass, morning glory "kang kong". Dessert was mango sticky rice, coconut icecream and fruit platter. The food taste was average but presentation waa above expectations.The service staff looked like they are from Thailand. Service is good and friendly, gentle and warm. Overall a good experience for me. Its as smooth as thai silk. Have eaten nicer and better thai food but good to try out Jim thomson for a visi
4
I wouldn't say it has the best Thai food in Singapore, but it's pretty decent. I love area and the ambience of the restaurant. A nice special treat. I've been here several times for a date night with the husband and also in larger group with friends. Always enjoyed the experience.
5
Excellent place for Thai food... Great decor & good service coupled with tasty Thai dishes being served.
5
This gorgeous restaurant at Dempsey Hill surely gives you graceful feeling at very reasonable price. Service staffs and decor will make you feel like celeb. Foods are good enough, overall great restaurant especially with someone special.
4
Amazing heritage building with many Thai artefacts. Very sweet and friendly service. Good food. We paid 80 SGD for the buffet incl only non alcoholic drink, slightly on the high side in my view.
5
The service was great and the staff fantastic. We chatted to a few and they were great people. The food was excellent but getting the attention of the service staff was a bit of a challege.
4
The restaurant is located a little bit off the botanic garden on the hill, away from the bustling streets in singapore. The restaurant itself sits within one of the old military barracks and the dessign is great.Food is really excellent and prices are in line with this type of restaurant. Staff was attentive and friendly.would certainly come back
5
Jim Thompson's thai restaurant at Dempsey Hill must be one of the finest thai restaurants in the world. I have had 5 star Thai cuisine in Thailand and Jim Thompson's is better than that.The setting in historic Tanglin Barracks is fantastic for atmosphere and the restaurant ambience is perfect. There are thai dancers moving through the restaurant which is quite a cultural touch too.The food simply superb. Very authentic and magnificently presented. I visit this restaurant every time i come to Singapore and have never been disappointed.Truly wonderful

The building and the atmosphere were great for a group of people. The food was just average at best. Beef satay was tasty, fish cakes were rubbery inside and soggy on the outside.The service was good. I wouldn't go back there for food. Maybe drinks on the patio

Jim Thompson is located in an old colonial bungalow as many restaurants on Dempsey Hill are. Its at a quite location on the Minden Road, away from the crowd of restaurants at the other end of the hill.Thai hospitality is very evident with staff members welcoming you 'Sawadee' as you enter. Thai dancers could be seen performing outside. It happened to be the birthday of one of the members of our group. He was in for a surprise as the restaurant staff and Thai dancers gathered around our table and played 'happy birthday'!Enjoyed fried chicken in pandan leaves and a thai prawn starter. Food was good but, but not exceptional. Highlight of the menu was the variety of vegetarian dishes on offer. Never seen a Thai restaurant with so many vegetarian options
5
Good fairly spreaded layout out in the open as well as inside stand alone bldg., Choice of a large range of Thai cuisine and they have a separate menu especially for vegetarian dishes also has a wide range of wine selection. The food and service both are simply excellent and we really relished our meals there. Will always be there when in Singapore
5
I always head to this fantastic Thai restaurant on my annual trips to Singapore. The food is just amazing and what makes it fantastic along with the beautiful outdoor section which we're always sure to book. Vegetarian thai green curry = A+. There are so many vegetarian options which I love but I always stick with what I know as it's faultless. The service is fairly good. Drinks are astronomically priced here in comparison to other places. I would forgo the Singapore Sling though, even if it's two for one
4
We stayed in Singapore several days, and in THE end we had many meals in this restaurant.Perfectly located nearby our hotel. Friendly owner. What a pity it's so far from London :-(
4
Had dinner several times at Jim Thompson's. We love the food and the relaxing atmosphere, even more so if you can have dinner outside on a (relatively) cool and dry evening!
5
Had a fantastic dinner at Jim thompson. Definetily one of my favorites in Singapore. Great food, drinks and staff! A must go!
4
The food was very authentic and traditional in taste and presentation. Service was exceptional. The food orders came in fast too. The ambience was very relaxing with traditional dancers dancing to the in-house music.
4
Went there over the weekend with 8 other people. Service and ambiance was excellent and we found the food far better than the one in Bangkok.
You paid for what you git though i.e. prices were steep.
5
Authentic flavours. Delicious taste. Good service. Great location. What more can someone ask for? Better to book ahead as it tends to get busy for dinner..
4
A bit on the pricey side but always a nice spot if you're in the Dempsey Hill area. For starter we had the tom yum soup - chicken and prawn...really good. A plate of chicken & beef satay...average. The mains were really good....red duck curry and a green Thai beef curry plus pineapple rice
4
My hubby and I went there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Ambiance is really nice, food was delicious!! I highly recommend the prawn yellow curry that is the chef speciality on the curry menu. The only down side of this place is that although it is nice every single dish on the menu just fells overpriced.
5
We ate dinner at Jim Thompson and were not disappointed. The food is delicious. They have an entire menu just for vegatarians which was awesome. The ambience of the place is classy and is a nice place to dine at. This place is expensive. Ask the restaraunt to call you a taxi 15-20 minutes before you are finishing your meal. It is not easy to get a taxi from there if you haven't cAlled for one and we had to take a bus ride home which was fun by the end. Would recommend this place a visit.
5
This is a great place to take family and friends who are visiting singapore. The food is not only delicious but you also get a fantastic Thai experience. The building itself is beautiful and the staff are very attentive. Also a lovely place to celebrate a special occasion. You inevitably end up ordering too much but I recommend taking away your leftovers so you can enjoy Thai food at home for the next few days!
5
Enjoyed a wonderful meal for my wife's birthday. The ambience, service and food were all excellent. Would highly recommend a visit.
5
Greart Thai food , great drinks, great ambience and great service. We thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The decor and Thai dancers really add to the ambience. The staff were excellent - very helpful and always smiling.
5
Decoration of this place is absolutely amazing. It is like being in Thai palace. Cocktails are delicious and food is always tasty. There are many exciting items in the menu and never disappointing. Great place for romantic dinners...
5
This is very special place to come for fine dining . Reservations needed . Better to come keeping dress code . Charming , expensive , memorable and one of a kind . The food is superb ,service is personalized . Good for special occasions for families / couples .
5
The food is authentic Thai and the service is excellent. The decor is so beautiful, creating a perfect ambience for a pleasurable dining experience. Quality of food is very good and the portions are generous. We enjoy taking our visitors here for dinner and would highly recommend it
4
I always prefer to sit outside because it's just such a nice place to be. The inside is also pretty cool, but the atmosphere outside is just slightly better I think. Thai ladies usually perform Thai dances twice throughout your dinner (outside there's a stage, inside they just stroll through the restaurant), but not with loud music or anything like that. Very classy. Drinks are expensive, but the food overall is of very high quality. Last time we tried some new things and everything was excellent. Never leave without the mango sticky rice for dessert
4
Had lunch with group of friends. Good value for the delicious food, good service, convenient location, free parking and nice ambience with even Thai dance around our tables. Had a Pattaya Set - excellent pomelo salad, fresh deep fried seafood & tasty Australian beef tenderloin. Love the special steak sauce that comes with the beef tenderloin. Portion might be a bit small but all yummy. The green curry is also very tasty. Never too crowded. Will definitely recommend this for all occasions

Jim Thompson is located in cosy part of Dimpsey Hill in Singapore. With high ceiling inside and large open space available outside, you can genuinely have a quiet quality time. Despite competitive situation to retain well trained employees, we will be welcomed by very cordial and smiling waitresses. Wide range of food choices and Thai drinks make the choosing process fun and if you prefer they have a wonderful appetizer combination as well. You will experience Thai local dance performance which will make you think about traveling to the country in reality. The quality and the quantity of food, the advise from the restaurant, and the overall experience of this restaurant ranks very high in this very competitive market
3
What a beautiful location, inside it has a colonial thai atmosphere, and luckily not a freezing AC climate but the place nicely being cooled by the ceiling fans. A nice terrace, romantically lit by candles.As starters we has chicken and beef skewers, and the manga and the papaya salads. Skewers were ok but not daunting, the salads were very nice, good bit of spice to them but not to much so that the other flavors would be blocked.As main we had a selection of dishes of which the red shrimp curry was the best, and the pad thai quite disappointing. Overall the flavors could have been more outspoken, now there was little difference between the 5 dishes we had and it looks like the chili level was too much tuned to western taste. We spend S$440 for a party of 6, no desserts and just a few beers, so quite pricey.
4
Wife and I had lunch. It is expensive for a travel budget but excellent food and atmosphere. Shared a mixed entree for two for S$35 which was enough for us with 3 fried items each and a green mango salad and rice.Lovely decor and tables well spaced. Included a traditional dancer. Staff very attentiv
5
Friendly, nice staff, good food, amazing ambience with Thai dancing. Pricy but worth it! Portions big enough to feed you, would recommend to anyone! Family friendly too... One of my most recommended places in Singapore to eat!
4
I have been a few times before but I was never impressed. However this time it was much better. Thai staff and great service, good food and fantastic ambiance. Pricey but we will come back.
3
The setup was great , food was disappointing ,I went to Jim Thompson in kuala lampore and this is not even close
5
Fantastic food and nice to sit and eat outside. Good service and some dancing entertainment. Really a nice place
4
Great service and excellent choice of dishes to choose from .Outdoor seating available if you want to enjoy the Singapore weather.Thi resaurant is expensive but worth it.

I recently visited Jim Thompson only because the restaurant is beautifully decorated and we were taking family out to dinner. We have been twice before and our general impression has always been lovely ambience but average food. We were given a corner table near the wine chiller and were frequently disturbed as the staff came in to get wine. Our server took our order wrong. When we pointed out her mistake she initially got rude and then when I got upset she very grudgingly apologised. In general she seemed disinterested when she took our order and so I was not surprised she got it wrong.The soup and satay were decent. But the pad Thai and red curry were quite bland and tasteless and definitely far below average.On my way out I decided to speak with the manager and to my shock turned out our rude server was the manager! Clearly the disinterested attitude comes from the top! Overall, over priced, poor service and clearly overrated
2
We went to celebrate our wedding anniversary at Jim Thompson on Dempsey Hill. There was ample parking space, and a short walk to the entrance. The staff greeted us in traditional Thai costumes, with a polite hand gesture.The beautiful decor with high ceiling was also quite nice. Nevertheless, those were the only plus points for the restaurant.Although we were very polite, we somehow got the feeling that our waitress was unhappy to be working there. It was just a vibe we got. The menu was very much overpriced for the usual Thai food and drinks. We ordered and the food was alright if you are paying street food prices or even mall prices. At the prices JT charged us, I'd say it was highway robbery.In a nutshell, if you wanna enjoy tasty Thai food, avoid this place if you can, as there are many other nice Thai restaurants at a fraction of JT's price.We are never going back
2
Went To Jt on a recent visit to SingaporeAmbience-Very goog. Staff polite and warmCocktails-over priced. Pineapple Mojito good as was the Sin SlingFood-average to Ordinarywe were served Beef instaed of chicken even after explaining while ordering that we do not eat Beef or Pork. This was treated very lightly by staff.Overall-good ambience but doesn't compensate for poor quality and overpriced food.Recommendation: Best avoided.
5
The meal we had at Jim Thomson was amazing. It was more sophisticated Thai food. I enjoyed every dish, several were old favourites but done with a twist. The service was excellent and attentive without being intrusive. The building was charming, an old barrack It was also a treat to be eating with natural ventilation without being blasted by air conditioning. The dancers danced gracefully amongst the tables in an unobtrusive way. A wonderful evening in every way
4
Great place.There was incredible atmosphere, nice food and nice staff. Authentic thai food was served, and the drinks were good too. Stylish, the decor was nice, and you feel relaxed when eating. The dancers are a nice touch too. I feel This place transports me to Thailand from the moment I've sat down. There was a wide selection of food too, and none of it disappointing.
4
Great meal, tasty cocktails, lovely service. We sat outside and had a thoroughly nice evening. Very good choice for Vegetarians.
5
In the 6 years we have been in Singapore, we have found ourselves at Jim Thomson every month, if not more! This is our favourite Thai place in Singapore. Not just because the ambience and the Thai dances are scintillating, but because this is one restaurant that scores a 10/10 in every front.So let me begin:If you visit Singapore when the weather is good, think of sitting outdoors. It is beautiful. If not, the inside is equally nice as well but the charm in Singapore is the ability to sit outdoors in some really nice areas like Dempsey where this restaurant is.Service - is outstanding. They are very polite and efficient.Our standard order isStarters:Papaya SaladSpring RollsCorn CakesMing Kiam (I am not sure if I am spelling this right. It is the betel leaf starter with various condiments to stuff inside with a delicious accompanying sauce)Main CourseStir Fried BrocolliThai Curry Red & Green Bean Sprouts with TofuAnd Tofu with Peppers and CashewsThai Fried RiceMixed Brown and Jasmine RiceDessertThe Coconut IcecreamDrinkThe Lemon Grass InfusionEvery dish is outstanding ! therefore I cannot rate one better than the other.It works out to about $200 for a table of four.Have a great meal
5
Loved Jim Thomson in Dempsey hill, weather was good so had the luxury of sitting al fresco...Beautiful gardens and interior, relaxed yet luxurious and extremely attentive staff.Don't be fooled by the menu this restaurant has an abundance of veggie options... just ask and a vegetarian only menu is produced.Everything was scrumptious... and the house speciality cocktail te Jim Thomson was delicious!There really was no negatives
3
Nice restaurant, we sat outside in the evening at the spacious area, surrounded by greenery, with thai dancers on show. The service was good, the waitress extremely helpful as we ordered for a large group. The food presentation was good, though the taste was nothing spectacular considering the higher than average cost: the satay seemed undercooked and bland, the red curry with duck was lacking in duck portions and rather watered down. Our cocktails was not cheap at around $24 - similar to the cost of a curry as mains. The mango pudding portion was huge, and proved popular with most. Overall pleasant evening in comfortable surroundings - our overseas guests were definitely impressed
4
I was there for a business dinner and enjoyed the experience. The food is good, the service was great, but the atmosphere is what makes it. When you arrive you are greeted by traditional Thai dancers and a lush landscape. It was a unique experience and I recommend it.
4
The setting is truly lovely; the service is prompt and accommodating. That being said, the food was not nearly as good as I remember it from my prior visits (at least two years ago). It is also on the expensive side so that my unhappiness about the food even more than it might otherwise have been
2
We asked our hotel concierge for a casual Thai restaurant recommendation and he sent us to Jim Thompson. Perhaps "casual" was lost in translation as this was a very expensive and upscale restaurant (2 ppl, no drinks and dinner was over $200). Cost aside, when you're in an Asian restaurant in Asia...and there are only white people in the restaurant, then you've probably been had. We had a starter trio and two of the items were inedible --can someone explain why the curry fish cake tasted like spam? The main entrees were boring and unmemorable. My "spicy" dish had barely any heat (this is supposed to be Thai, right?) and was sitting in a pool of oil. My husband's fish dish fared a little better. Overall, a big disappointment. We ate inside which felt a little stuffy. If you are going, I recommend eating outside which looked like it had better ambiance. The service was very attentive until the end. After we finished it took over 30 minutes to get our check and pay. This place has a lot of good reviews so clearly some folks love it but it just wasn't the right fit for me
4
Had a great Champagne birthday buffet lunch at the Jim Thompson on Dempsey Hill. Always a pleasure to dine here, the colonial building and great decor provides a wonderful setting for a great occasion. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was excellent & the buffet with free flow champagne was great value
5
I was here with friends on Valentine's Day. The décor is simply out of this world and spectacular. The large settees with big pillows were extremely comfortable. So many things to look at you almost forget that you came to eat. On the subject of eating I was very impressed with the selection. All of the ingredients were fresh and plate presentation while rustic was something we talked about during dinner and everyone gave it a huge thumbs up. I really liked the cocktail menu as it was unique and had a very pleasant surprises on it. I’ll be back again for sure
5
What a lovely restaurant. Fresh spicy Thai food, full of goodness and colour in a romantic lovely building - a real treat. The Thai beef salad is fiery and delicious. The Thai omelette is superb, the stir fried chicken and curries sensational. All the better due to a light yet full Pinot noir sipped alongside the tasty food... A great night out!
4
The restaurant is not too far from Singapore's orchid garden.
A bit expensive but really good in a church like atmosphere. We had a good time.
3
Well, would you go at a restaurant just for its nice setting? The aesthetics and global ambiance are great. The food is acceptable, but not at all at the level of this pricey restaurant and of its overpriced rates. We expected much better; especially the starters are insignifiant. It is not disastrous, but one needs to compensate for other comments grossly over-rating this place.Avoid the wines, below average
4
Jim Thompson is a nice Thai restaurant, with very well executed Thai food and a great location. Whether you eat outside - calm and lovely terrasse - or inside - very good decoration and lots of space - the atmosphere is very nice.Food wise, this is definitely some good Thai food (not so easy to find in Singapore). Starters are good (tried many of them and this is consistently some tasty good Thai food. In the main dishes menu, I would recommend the curries. Green, yellow, red or others, they are all absolutely delicious. Price wise, the place is not so cheap but when you consider the lovely location and atmosphere of the restaurant and the very tasty Thai food, I believe this is a good option for a lovely evening with friends or for a romantic dinner.
5
Our customer asked what we were going to do this particular evening as they could not join us for dinner. We obviously said we were going to eat and they said that if we liked Thai food we should try Jim Thomson – So we did!It’s on the edge of town in the ‘hills’ at the far end of Orchard Road but worth the trip.The service was excellent as was the Thai dance entertainment. The food is exceptional and flavoursome.I’m off to Singapore again this week and will certainly go again
5
I celebrated my 50 birthday at Jim Thomson with friends living in Singapore, and it was a perfect night. Food was great, really great actually. Some of the best Thai we ever had, and we'we had some. Service was pleasantly good, but the dancers were kind of weird. Some say the best Thai Food in Sing right now. I wouldn't know, but it can not be far from tru
5
went at night to dine at the terrasse of this thai restaurant and it was a very good experience. We had delicious cocktails with lemon grass and lime basil as aperitif and then the food came with good flavors and good spice level. The service was fast and the ambiance was zen close to the basin. We even had dancing show of local thai dances. Great place in a nice stylish house
4
My 3rd visit to Jim Thompson. All 3 visits were very good and we enjoyed our night out. The menu is very good and the dishes that we selected were tasty, carefully prepared and served. It is quite authentic, classy and probably the best Thai restaurant in Singapore. It is expensive but the experience and ambiance are excellent (try eating indoors and outdoors on different visits). Excellent service, good atmosphere and a reasonable selection of wines. Very Good Indeed
4
Jim Thomson has beautiful Thai ambiance and lovely hospitality, it's a great place to visit in case you're hosting a Dinner or aLunch.Service is commendable and the staff will surely win you over by their warmth.We went for the Buffet as the ala carte is very expensive. Food presentation is great and most of the authentic Thia delicacies are part of the buffet. We particularly enjoyed the Steamed Chilly Fish and the Tom Yum Soup. Green curry was tasty as well.Overall a great dining experience
5
Jim Thompson is situated in the outskirts of Dempsey Hill area of Singapore, so be assured that the restaurant is amidst the greenery and quiet part. The moment we entered the restaurant, we were amazed by the ambience and sheer size of this place. I would recommend to sit in the outside area as they have a lovely Thai music with a rustic set up of tables, antiques, and lamps.The food is of course Thai, and the menu is extensive. I have one word for the food - excellent. Worth trying is the Sukothai appetizer platter, it's filling and worth every penny. The Tom Yam Seafood was excellent too. Cocktails are quite pricey though. I didn't find the dessert section to be very exciting, so skipped it.The service of the staff is top notch. Oh they also have a traditional Thai dance in the outside area.I totally recommend this place - go for it
4
Nestled in the lush greenery of Dempsey Hill and opposite the quaint St George's Church, is this charming restaurant. Tastefully furnished with a spacious al fresco area, this set the stage for a memorable meal. Olive fried rice with cashew nuts, lime and sliced chillies (very very hot so avoid these if you can't take flaming spicy food!) was delicious. Phad Thai fried noodles with crisp fresh beansprouts is recommended. Lemongrass tea complemented the meal well. The mango and sticky rice was sprinkled with fragrant roast sesame seeds - Cannot be missed!Service was attentive and prompt.
4
getting the attention of the service staff was a bit of a challege. otherwise the food was amazing. will definitely go back
4
Been here a few times, but 1st time for a Sunday lunch They have a good selection of cocktails. Good and strong, but very expensive at $25 eachChoice between regular a la carte and $68 buffet with drinks ($98 with alcohol). I chose the former, with the $25 cocktail mentioned aboveOrdered the usual Thai staples - fried chicken balls, spicy morning glory leaves, and red curry with duck. All were good, as usualService was also ok. The setting and ambience is a plu
4
We had a very nice diner in this place. Good choice of meals, the green and red curries are very tasty and the service was efficient and smily ( land of smile ..). We had diner inside, although it is a bit noisy, the ambiance was great and the place is beautiful. A little expensive but it worth it 
5
We LOVED this restaurant. The food was amazing. We had a hard time deciding what to order because everything on the menu looked delicious. We were not disappointed. The servers were very attentive and we loved the atmosphere (used to be an army baracks). Restrooms are located outside of the restaurant. We ordered a sampler platter as a starter - lots of variety to enjoy. Our main dishes were plentiful and full of flavor and color. We enjoyed cocktails and wine throughout our dinner.A must if you are in the area
4
We went there for a business dinner and it was amazing. We were sitting outside, it was nice and quiet. The food was delicious, the wine selection was quite good. The desert menu is rather small. And if you pay with a credit card you have to come inside to insert your pin code, that's odd. But overall the restaurant is amazing. Such a tranquil island in the middle of a busy city.
5
We travelled to Singapore for our Honeymoon and were recommended by my cousin to visit this restaurant. We were not disappointed. The service was great and the staff fantastic. We chatted to a few and they were great people.The food was excellent. If we lived in Singapore we would be regulars
4
One of the best Thai restaurants I have eaten in; we had a Sunday buffet lunch there and the selection of dishes was superb. Especially loved the variety of the Thai salads that just popped with fresh flavours and the curries were to due for. Not inexpensive but definitely worth it; the ambiance alone is worth a visit but the food is mind blowing. A must visit if you are in Singapore
5
I visited jim Thompson last year in October and was amazed how good the food and the service was... I went there again last night and was happy that it is still as excellent as 1st time.The curries are delicious and the starters are fantastic The staff are superb
3
Jim Thompson at Dempsey is excellent for fine dining with its lovely ambience, graceful dancers and delicious Thai cuisine if you don't mind the terribly expensive prices and awfully small portions. The details are immaculate, the menu offers an extensive choice for both vegetarians and non vegetarians. The cocktails' quality are excellent. Parking is convenient. However, the service staff should indicate that the portions are really small, highlight there is a family portion for larger groups and there is a more affordable set meal option. If a bowl of white rice served in a fancy covered bowl priced at $4 is not for you, there are other establishments which serve equally delicious but at more affordable prices Thai cuisine minus the frills. I paid $140 for two people sharing a bowl of red curry, a plate of olive fried rice and a small plate of Thai mango glutinous rice
3
Went here for a birthday dinner. It wasn't bad, but for the price I expected better. The ambience and esthetics are beautiful. Unfortunately, the food didn't live up to expectation. - don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad - just overpriced for what it is
5
Dinner last night... All I can say is SENSATIONAL! Not the cheapest Thai meal you will have, but from the decor, the staff, the ambience to the wicked cocktails and food...couldn't have loved it more!
Will definitely return. Thanks for a memorable evening.
4
Been there a few times, always happy to go back. Smiley and pleasant waitresses, excellent food with a large selection of dishes from all across Thailand. Tip: outside tables not recommended for lunch (too hot).
5
located in the old barraks the owners have done a very nice transformation of the place to very elegant thai food. the quality is excellent reasonably priced and a very nice atmosphere.one can sit inside and outside both are very nice.
5
Went thrice in three months and it got better each time. The ambience impressed throughout but I was struck by the pricing on my first visit. There were a couple of dishes eg the beef which was slightly salty and the phad thai which was sweeter than expected but the coconut ice-cream is a must-have. I remember liking the duck on my first visit in Sept and the appetizer platter. Second visit was with colleagues and the dinner set was impeccable - a coconut-based soup that was delightful, a mains that comprised a fish, green curry and vegetables, finishing with dessert of coconut ice-cream and glutinous rice and mango. You'll need to have time to dine here
5
I traveled to Singapore on business and some of my local colleagues brought me to this restaurant. I mentioned I my favourite cuisine was Thai. This was excellent, the location which was an old British army barracks building was converted into a very stylish restaurant with REALLY high ceilings.Nice feel to it.Food was excellent, I couldn't fault it at all. The menu was extensive with many dishes I have never heard of before, wine was also lovely.I ate inside the building but they have a large outdoor area too which looked great.I even tried he Durian dessert, l(ook it up on Wikipedia) and if I actually liked it, MUCH to the dissapointment of my colleagues, I don't think they thought I'd like it.Anyway I would recommend this restaurant without reservation!! (although you might want to make a reservation before you take the taxi ride)Enjoy! I will be back
4
Without a doubt one of the nicest restaurants in Singapore with very good food. The expected dishes are present and well done, great green curry, acceptable Pad Thay and amazing chicken in pandan leaf as well as other greatly acomplished dishes. Don't miss the pomelo salad
3
We visited on a Sunday evening and the setting is very nice with attention to detail of Thai heritage. This seemed a quiet night and the wait staff were not too stretched. The woman who seemed to be in charge emphasised by being dressed in black was particularly unhelpful and her attitude gave the impression you had to fit in with the restaurants wishes and you, as the customer, were unimportant. I should make clear it was the manager/supervisor and other staff were pleasant. Still a fish rots from the head. Food was acceptable and efficiently served. Price is at the high end. Not a disaster by any means but you can do better than this expensive restaurant in Singapore
4
Food is very tasty though I felt it was little expensive. Per head cost would be about 50 dollars per head. They also have a set buffet for 70 dollars.The ambience is great though their last order for lunch is at 2.30 which is early specially on sundays.Highly recommended. The salads are out of the worl
4
The restaurant has a very nice outdoor setting, spacious and clean. Dancers entertain in a middle stage but it is really nice and quiet. The food selection is good. The service deserves better though. My main course was forgotten and it took 3 attempts and 20 mins to have a manager to come and sort it out. They didn't charge for it and gave us an extra 10% discount on the bill but still It shouldn't really happen and eating my food after every one else was not enjoyable anymore
4
This restaurant up in the hills was beautiful and the food was so tasty.i would just say be aware of the things that aren't priced.i paid $182 for a lobster which put a slight damper on the evening .my partner would highly recommend the black pepper cra
4
The decor in this restaurant is quite something
However the prices and the food do not always match
Beware of anything with chicken as it will probably have the bones
Service was good but not spectacular
5
What a great find in a beautiful spot and in an amazing building you do feel like you have been transported to Thailand..
All the food was good but the satay has to be tried possibly the best ever!
4
Great food, samplers are good as starters, red thai curry is my favourite, boiled rice, lovely presentation and very Good customer service, thai dancing give it that authentic attraction.
5
What a fantastic experience! We had thai at "Authentic Thai" on boat quay promenade the night before and we were bitterly disappointed. Jim Thompson on Dempsey Hill however restored our faith in Singapore's capability to deliver a good thai meal. First class venue, attentive staff, fabulous food....well done team
4
This restaurant is located in what appears to have been a church: a central and oblong hall, with two lateral aisles separated from the main hall by thick pillars. High vaulted ceilings with dark wood beams, All in all a very airy ambiance. Tasteful decoration and very good lighting. Service is very quick, attentive and unobtrusive. Food was excellent in taste and presentation. For desert try the sticky rice with mango. Highly recommended
5
In Singapore one expects to find oneself in some concrete jungle - not here. The restaurant and large outdoor area are a very pleasant change from the norm. The restaurant is large but with its high ceilings and well laid out dining area one has the feeling of intimacy. Yes, what about the food and service - the service was excellent and the food was very well prepared. I hd my favorite dessert of sticky rice and mango - even if it was out of season
4
Just had an excellent dinner with a group of colleagues. Sat outside as not too hot / humid. Unobtrusive, fast service. Sampled different starters and mains; great selection. Was a bit worried about the heat rating but "medium" means medium... And it says you can order to suit (didn't test this out...). Atmosphere was a little subdued, hence 4 rather than 5 but it was a Monday night..
3
The decor and settings were elegantly opulent. Lots of wood and has high ceilings with a huge ceiling fan. Service staff were very attentive and pleasant, with Thai music and Thai dancer to complete the ambience. Food portions were reasonable and tasty. But the fried pandan chicken were a tad tough. Tom yum soup was yummy, and so was the Thai green curry - which went very well with pineapple rice. Though I was disappointed with fried spring rolls. Mango sticky rice - mango was deliciously sweet but the sticky rice was a tad chewy
5
I guess it is impossible to please everybody all of the time but you know what? We just had another great night at JT. Superb ambiance....drinks outside before taking our table. We shared starters and soup before ordering mains. The new waitress called Trainee.....what a lovely lady, nervous since she has only been there one week but need not worry. We throughly enjoyed our evening and will definitely visit again
2
hi - this was not the first time I have visited this restaurant - so imagine my displeasure. My friends brought their own wine and we were informed at the start that a $40 corkage applied. They took the bottles away to be refrigerated, and we enjoyed them during the dinner.Imagine my surprise when when the bill showed $65+++ fr corkage for a bottle of sparkling wine. We said to the waitress but you told us the charge was $40, and you took the bottles away and never mentioned an even higher cost for sparkling wine?Whilst apologetic,,, she explained this was the house rule and it could not be adjusted. Well, guess what...... you just lost my future business - stupid people - stop gouging your customers
4
Held a business dinner here which was very good, although the staff were a bit slow, the food was excellent
5
We went with friends to Jim Thompson's on a Sunday evening. Everything about it is first class. Top flight, non-intrusive service, beautiful and quiet surroundings (we sat outside because of a smoker), comfortable furniture, and of course fantastic food. We are a group of people with diverse food allergies, but had no trouble finding yummy dishes to sample. We shared 5 small plates, and 1 large plates for 4 of us, and we had plenty to eat. Little pandan packets, a curry, mango salad, it was all delicious, and beautifully presented. I don't think it matters what you order
3
The ambience and welcome was great. Love the decor, the layout of the restaurant and the various areas with a distinctly different style.The huge ceiling fan in the indoor area was impressive. As was the subtle traditional music and the dancers who appear within your sphere of vision once in a while.The food and service were a disappointment. The Thai fish and was tasteless and rubbery. The beef green curry had very few pieces of beef. I have had better Tom Yam Goong. The dishes were seriously mediocre.The service started well but dwindled over the course of dinner. We had to ask multiple times for our water to be refilled and for the dessert menu. Portions overall were small. The bill was the only thing that was large. More than $65 per head for a dinner for four with no wine and conservative ordering for small appetites.

Had a business meeting at this restaurant.Ordered a selection of items, all of which were delicious, I can't remember the name of half of them but the prawn curry was out of this world, the best I've ever had. Not cheap, but nowhere in Singapore is
5
Joined 20+ colleagues for a team building session after work and I am glad we chose Jim Thompson. Drinks in the courtyard pre dinner set the tone for the night. The staff were first class and friendly and we all enjoyed the Thai traditional dancers.The dishes were selected before our arrival which ensured we were not waiting to long. 20+ is a lot to cater for but they managed at Jim Thompson. The food kept coming and was well presented and typically Thai. Yes I will go back with friends
3
Honestly up-front, I don't quite know how to place this restaurant. My wife and I went there as a significant birthday celebration so perhaps our expectations were set quite high.The restaurant decor and atmosphere delivered the experience we were after in spades, and the staff were oh so friendly and obliging. It's just the food.OK, so Sydney has some very good Thai restaurants and we have eaten in Thailand from all ranges of restaurants. We just weren't that impressed at the quality and value for money at Jim Thompson. The food was good for a suburban Thai restaurant but didn't reach the heights we expected for the price we paid.So there you have it. We might be being churlish but for us it didn't cut it at the level we expected and paid for
4
We were there for the weekend, the place was full & seem very popular.Our table was shown & the appointed waitress seem to be novice in her handling our order. She couldn't understand English well for example we order stuff chicken wings , she said pandan chicken to us We had slowly repeat the orders to her. To cut the whole experience our kids fried did not arrive when the whole order came plus despite 4 reminders. We had or complain to the manager on this & finally the rice came when the adults were almost finish eating. The Manager was very apologetic & waive the service charge & the deserts were on the house . It's good in food & shows that they are serious of providing a good servic
3
Heard so much about this place, never thought of dining here...finally I did...impressive of food taste like eating THAI food in THAILAND...understand on maximize revenue versus space...if u look for a place to dine romantically, NOT this place...Tables are set TOO Near to other tables..Can hear other conversations...If you look for quick dining and go...Perhap
4
A friends brought me to Jim Thomson for dinner - the food is good, you have a accessible meal (around 25$ for a pad thai), around 20$ for a starter, and the atmosphere is very nice, inside or outside. I loved this place and will definitively come back again 
5
This restaurant is incredible!! It was recommended to us by a friend that lives in Singapore and we were not disappointed.The building is spectacular and the menu nothing short of that! I am a fussy vegetarian and there was more than enough to keep me happy. My 4 yr old daughter was also spoilt for choice.The staff were so friendly and helpful and cocktails delicious!More expensive than other restaurants we visited but worth every pennyThis restaurant is a must for anyone that loves Thai food
5
One of the best tom Yum with Prawn - amazing flavor . The chicken wrapped with leaves and fried great starter - garlic rice ..honestly with so much food you dont know where to start ! great ambience and a nice photo op too !
5
A lot of dishes are very nice, also dancer will show thai traditional dancing in front of guests with great set-up whole environment
4
This is our third visit here. As Australians who are spoilt for choice back home and have done the obligatory Thai holiday, we find this place serving some of the best we've had. Great service and delightful little theatrics. But best of all, spicy, tasty, well prepared food. Some say pricy, but we ARE in Singapore. Must tries: the Massaman Curry, Green Curry and Tom Yum soup
5
Smartly located in Dempsey area in a very tranquil location. Service is extremely pleasant and polite. The food is fantastic covering all the main famous dishes from the Siam Kingdom. Tom Yang soup, chicken skewers, different kinds of beef and fish, all very well cooked and presented. The wines are amazingly expensive, well not that shocking if you are used to Singapore pricing on alcohol beverages. Reservation highly needed
5
We happened to have a business dinner at this restaurant alongwith my colleagues of different nationalities. The ambience was excellent with a feel of Thai culture. We decided to go for thai food and were delighted to savour amazing delicacies on offer. A very good place or i must say a must go whenever you are in singapore
4
On my first trip to Singapore, this is where I met up with my friends, who are all Americans and we decided to have Thanksgiving dinner at a Thai restaurant called Jim Thompsons. All the american restaurants were fully booked so we had no choice but to choose somewhere else. While it was not a traditional thanksgiving dinner with Turkey and cranberry sauce, it was a delicious meal nonetheless. My thanksgiving dinner consisted of chicken pad thai and mango sticky rice for dessert. We all sampled each others dishes. So I also tasted green curry, a crab dish and an array of other items I wasnt quite sure what they were but ate it all ravenously. We all said what we were thankful for and toasted each other with tropical breezes and thai absolut drinks. All the while we dined, a thai dancer did a traditional slow moving dance between the tables. The ambience made me feel like a princess in tropical asian palace. The presentation of the food was just as amazing as the taste. My one advice is to bring a full wallet - entrees are pricey
4
Just finished a lovely dinner here. It was a beautiful evening so we sat outside and were entertained by their Thai dancer. The ambience was perfect and the staff are very attentive. We decided to try something different tonight and had the beef salad with red grapes which I would strongly recommend if you like something slightly spicier to start. I only have good things to say about this restaurant, it is one of the best Thai places in Singapore and we will definitely be back
4
This was nice place with good food. Staff was very courteous and suggested some great items on the menu. When we requested for certain customisation, they were quick to give their confirmation and food was in adherence to the request.The rates were a little on the higher side and overall cost for a family or group of 4 can be expensive if one was to have a 4 course mealPortions were sufficient; service and preparation time was quick. another insignificant but noteworthy part was the options for vegans and vegetarians. they had a separate menu for the same.The coolers had descriptions for health which was very nice and creative
5
Dempsey Hill is recommended as one of the locales in Singapore renowned for excellent cuisine, and the Jim Thompson Thai Restaurant didn't disappoint at all! In a charming and atmospheric building, guests enjoyed an authentic Thai dining experience with excellent signature dishes. Service was friendly and welcoming. Certainly on the expensive side if wine is included, but if the focus is on food, atmosphere and very good value, recommend sticking with the local beer
4
The atmosphere is of a typical upmarket Thai restaurant, with attentive staff and dancers to provide some entertainment. The food was good, but not amazing - solid , quality Thai fare. The wine was reasonably priced for Singapore - but that still means it's expensive! Fantastic cocktails - the mangotinis went down very easily
5
It gives you culture & feel of Thailand with great food. Ambiance is super. Slightly away from main area so get your taxi organised in advance or your own transport.
3
If you love authentic thai food then you will surely be disappointed. But if you want to have an evening where ambiance is important then this is a gorgeous setting.
4
Enjoyable evening given the beautiful outdoor setting and great food. A little pricey and the inability to serve tap water lost it a star
5
My friend and I had were very impressed with the food at this restaurant. The restaurant has a lovely atmosphere too and the decor is very ornate. This is the best Thai food I've had in Asia so far.
4
We were recommended to go there for lunch and the welcome was a bit cold, we felt we were bothering the staff.But after a while it became better, service-wise and we enjoyed the excellent food.Nice place but a bit too noisy and itÂ´s quite a pricy place
3
Went to there eat when step in the atmosphere was normal. The air con like spoil I feel hot. The food was serve was normal too don't have a wow surpirse to me. The tom yam soup too much coconut taste. The pineapple rice also average. If you ask me will come again. I will never come.
4
I was taken to JT by a colleague residing in Sg. Friendly staff, good ambience, good food. It's not in the city centre but was quite busy on a Tuesday evening. So I would recommend making reservations. The restaurant itself is quite different to what you get in the city. It's set up is nice, and the place is very clean & nicely maintained.
3
When you arrive, you think, wow! If the atmosphere is an indicator of the food, we'll be in for a treat. Sorry to report that the food is "just ok." For example, fish cakes (a Thai staple in my book) were unremarkable, over-cooked and tasted more like shriimp. Presentation is generally nice but taste for the dishes we had was really basic. Service, unfortuantely, was uniimpressive - it took nearly 20 min to have our glass of wine brought to the table and they never came back to even check to see if our food was ok. I would find a different spot at Dempsey
4
Despite a strange reservation line which insisted they could only accomodate a party of 6 (we wanted 12) the restaurant was half empty as we arrived st 9 pm. Drinks at the bar were good and pretty strong cocktails (good).Food was inconsistent but most was of a high standard, high end Thai if a little unimaginative. The ambiance is very pleasant with Thai dancers circulating periodically. Staff were very good, my wine glass was never empty.A nice colonial throwback. My US colleague insisted the Brits murderedThompson whilst the Brits said he got lost in the jungle. We shall never know, maybe the staff do ??
4
Really is a great location and atmosphere. Outdoor seating was very nice too. Service was good. Food was good but not spectacular when compared to the price-tag. To a degree this is the nature of the Dempsey area. Might come back, but only on a special occasion
3
The atmosphere is great - the decor amazing - silks and dancers and 100s of great menu options - with a little more care factor in the service it would be an excellent experience. Romeo was the exception - he at least seemed to care if we wanted to order. The food once you get it is worth the wait
4
I very much like to go to Jim Thompson. Restaurant is in an old army "barrack". Nicely decorated! Food was very good. Had the signature starters followed by curries and other types of thai food. Overall i love the atmosphere and will go there next time i am in Singapore again
2
The only positive aspect is the settings : it's a beautiful place. Otherwise the cocktails are way overpriced for what they are (very sweet, lack of flavor and not a lot of alcohol). The food is average, it's not completely bad but it's not high level at all. A bit fat, small portions and not fine enough. The staff is just not nice, not even the minimum politeness, not efficient and somewhat not welcoming/smiling. I will not go back, it's a waste of money
4
Two couples, with kids, visited this fine establishment for Sunday lunch. They offer a very decent buffet. The offering is not extensive but the quality is very good. Even has a pasta corner for kids. This is a nice touch as kids can struggle a bit at a thai restaurant. I did discover a hair in one of the dishes,but these things can happen. Overall a great lunch, but a bit pricey.
5
Quite easily one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to. A result of the location, decor, design, ambience, quality of service and of course the exceptional and authentic food! A bit on the pricier side but well worth it for the overall experience. I've been a regular patron for over 3 years now and the consistency of Jim Thompson is a class apart. The seating inside is fantastic, but the restaurant also has a large al fresco dining area which makes for a great night out with friends when the weather is cooler. Can't go wrong with most dishes on the menu and of course they are more than happy to provide off the menu items and cater to specific dietary requirements.Options for vegetarians are vast and you can not go wrong with a meal at JT. Make sure to leave some room for dessert
5
We visited this restaurant with some friends in Singapore. The Raw papaya salad was just out-of-this world. The ambience of this place is awesome with part of the restaurant indoors while the rest is alfresco. Highly recommended if you're looking for some gourmet quality thai food in singapor
5
Visited several times, and the restaurant is reliably good. Inside is nicely decorated, staff is very friendly, place gives you calmness. The dishes have been reliably good and you you can explore many different Thai tastes. During the meals you will find some of the staff dancing slowly between the tables, adding graciousness to an already refined atmosphere. It is a bit pricey, but since different that "the usual Thai restaurant in a shopping mall or in a hotel" in Singapore, worth it
5
As Thai restaurants go this must be one of the best! Large, high ceilinged dining room with excellent levels of air conditioning, essential in Singapore. A menu of wide choice making it difficult to select. My party had three different dishes and all very, very happy with their choice. Beautiful Thai dancers were the only (welcome) distraction from an otherwise riveting dining experience
3
It's in a beautiful area and the building is huge with a cool decor and Thai dancers around as you eat. The food is good. It's a good place for a business meal or meeting friends as you can share plates. There wasn't anything that was a stand out but all tasty and like all wines on Singapore the list is ridiculously expensive. It was a fun evening overall
3
Executive summary: there are better restaurants at Dempsey Hill and better Thai restaurants in Singapore. Talking about the atmosphere: inside it is huge and noisy and outside it is not nice at all because instead of the very tall and very strong street lights. No comparison to the absolutely romantic garden seating of the The Wine Co @ Dempsey Hill. The food was okay – the two curries we had were truly excellent and everything else was mediocre. The service too was mixed – the head waitress understood her job but the girl who served us did not know anything. Asking what the volume of a “glass” of beer is compared to the pint they have on the menu the answer was “a glass is half a liter I guess ….
4
Returned to Jim's for a business dinner. Great atmosphere and decor. Service was swift, friendly and helpful. Food was tasty and good quality
3
Not easy to find. You need a taxi. Friendly and efficient service. Reasonable pricing getting to the higher end. Excellent satay and Musaman curry.
5
Our friends took us to this restaurant. It is really a high quality restaurant. The food was perfect, a lot of local meals. The selection of wines was huge. The service was perfect. Choose different meals in order to understand the taste of Singapore.
5
First visit to this restaurant and it was delightful. Food and service extremely good. The old style high ceilinged building main building took us back to Thailand itself. Well worth a visit
5
Love this restaurant because it takes you back to the old Thai village with a posh setting. Food is not disappointinformation. It is keeping it's standard. This us my second visit. I will go again.
4
You walk into a giant mansion and the architecture and furnishings are indeed impressiveWe started at the bar and the service was good, and the drinks competentWe ordered a parade of dishes. The starters of curry fish cakes and chicken in pandan leaves were thai favs and they were done well. Our mains include the massamam curry, steamed seabass in lime and spicy morning glory which are also all thai maimstays and all well cooked. The desserts of mango and durian with sticky rice and the water chestnut red ruby were also goodOverall, competent food but therein lies a problem i think. Nothing wows. Everything is as exactly what one would expect. Some people like that. But i'm sure others expect more these days. And it's not difficult to do so if they try harder. For example if they put more jackfruit into the red ruby, that will elevate the dish beyond the mundan
3
This restaurant has lots of hype about it but it doesn't live up to it. It's over-priced, out of the way and the restaurant itself feels too large to be romantic/intimate.The service is excellent but the food is just ok and the for these prices I expect exceptional.As it's slightly out of the way you need good reasons to go there and unfortunately I wasn't given one to go back
4
firstly the location on dempsey hill adds to the ambience and the whole dining experience . great food with good service. we visited here on a balmy june evening and were very impressed with this restaurant . it was a business dinner and we enjoyed the spread .
4
The Dempsey area is full of nice restaurants, many in old government buildings. Jim Thompson is in an old records office. A high ceiling and plenty of space between the tables has given it a nice ambiance.The food is good, not adventurous, but cooked well. You shouldn't expect much deviation from the well known Thai dishes, but being our second trip, it is clearly consistent. We had seafood in 2 dishes, and both were very fresh. The drink list is great if you want an aperitif and the wine list is comprehensive, but maybe a little expensive. On this occasion, we were meeting with an old friend and it was a great setting to do so. A nice touch are the Thai dancers moving around and providing some entertainment, without the noise by the way.Overall, worth a visit if you are looking for good food, and nice surroundings. It is not cheap but reasonable value if you consider all the good points
4
My wife and I went for a date night while in Singapore. We ended up in Dempsey Hill and found Jim Thompson. The food was good, but this is expected in Singapore. It's Thai, and good food is sort of the minimum standard here. The setting, however, distinguishes this place a bit. We sat outside on a beautiful and pleasant evening. Enjoyed a bottle of wine with our dishes and then the Thai dancing started. Quite a nice addition. We topped it off with coconut dumplings, which were delicious
4
Definitely worth a visit. Quite pricey hit food tasted good. Service was at par with what you'd find at restaurants of equal stature in Singapore. Would go back.
5
If you are visiting Singapore you need to go to this restaurant. A wonderful atmosphere, delicious food, fantastic service!
3
went yesterday to this restaurant, the food is good, the teracce nice, but you will have to spend around 160 SGD for 2 people for one diner (wihtout wine). INdeed all the courses are around 30 SGD each. I would say that if you live around why not. But do not take a taxi to come over...or add 30SGD.... If you do not know singapore, and you want something good you can go there...but I m pretty sure tat you can find the same quality around and cheape
3
Visited the restaurant for a get together with friends. Cocktails were the only thing that impressed me apart from the decor. The food was a complete let down and the service lackluster. All the dishes we ordered had the same flavour undertone. I expect Thai food to be bold on palate, so the insipid & bland fare served here left me totally unimpressed
5
Great setting for some mouth-watering Thai fare as authentic as it can get! High ceiling, great ambience, colourful Thai miniatures together with classy Thai dancers weaving their way unobtrusively around the tables, makes this place surreal and special!! Add to that a children friendly setting with ever-smiling and polite staff make this a great place to take your entire family out on a Sat evening....& that's precisely what we did
4
Dined during a recent visit to Singapore. Tried a variety of dishes, all very good. Nice wine selection. Service friendly and prompt, among the best we experienced while in Singapore. A bit pricy as other reviews point out but similar levels to other restaurants we visited in Singapore. Would visit again.
3
Brought my team for lunch. Almost missed the restaurant after turning into Dempsey Road as the signage was small but parking space was ample. Nice interior decor with double volume ceiling. Lemongrass flavored hand towel was a welcome relief. We ordered signature dishes like the Thompson chicken (which was so-so), fried grouper with sweet chilli sauce (can tell the fish was fried some time ago...) & beef mini-steak w tamrind sauce which was best tasting. Desserts were standard thai selections but we found the king mountain cat durian w sticky rice most memorable. Overall, for the price we paid, Thanying would have been more value for money...
5
lovely ambience.. its the perfect restaurant for special occasions..being on the expensive end....delicious food.. Veggies..moment to rejoice, they have a separate vegetarian menu.. :) the olive rice, rice flavoured with lemongrass & red chillies with thai green curry are really good.. also a veg starter ...dnt r'ber the name.. its a roll with basil & bursts out with flavours is divine.. Cucumber juice is refreshing.Special mention of their well versed staff.
3
I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food - the papaya salad was excellent but barring that nothing was exceptional - it was pretty much standard Thai fare. The mussaman curry was very oily and below average, the green curry was nice. The egg fried rice was certainly delicious. But given all that I'd heard about it, certainly a let down
4
Was there for a business lunch. Great location and not very busy during lunchtime. Lovely decor with a lot of Jim Thompson silk cushions. High ceiling made the place feel palatial and surprisingly authentic looking. Attentive service but unobtrusive. Staff are well versed in their knowledge of the menu. Food was good. Almost as good as in Thailand! During the meal, we also had a Thai dancer come through the room which was interesting. Power went off twice though and they had to turn the air conditioning off...which made it a bit hot and stuffy. Had standing fans which helped a little. Overall, an authentic Thai meal in a nice location
4
Had another great evening at Jim Thompson - Thai food was great with efficient service - around $SG 500 for 4 adults & 2 children. Thai dancer drifting around the restaurant added to the entertainment. Looking forward to my next visit later this year
5
One of the best upmarket restaurants in Singapore for thai food. Great ambience and decor with food to match. Obviously on the expensive side. Worth a visit.
4
I love this restaurant. The decor is nice especially if you dine outside when it is not too hot. They have very nice thay dishes and good platters to share. Great for couples or friends. I also organized some corporate events there.
5
A lovely location, felt almost out of the city. Beautiful ambience both outdoors as well as indoors. Smiling hostesses and nice Thai dance performances between the tables. Also a good number of options for vegetarians.
4
That is a place to visit with friends, family.....Food is good with certain service, the main reason is nice environment to spend weekend time there, peace and relaxing ~~~
5
We arrived when it was raining and were greeted by a young gentleman who gave as an umbrella to walk to the front door with. When we arrived at the front door there was another person there to take the umbrella from us, nice!We stepped inside of this wonderful building to be greeted by the good old traditional Thai greeting..The menu has a lot to choose from and a lot of dining options. We tried a couple of dishes that we haven’t tried before despite our numerous visits to Thailand and we were not disappointed. They also make a great Mojito cocktail. The service was top notch and we didn’t want for anything.They have a lovely outdoor setting that would be lovely to sit in at night (if not raining). Will try get back again before we leave Singapore
5
Three of us from N. America were in town for a conference and were looking for a restaurant for lunch. One was quite familiar with the story of Jim Thompson and that only made this stunning restaurant all the more interesting. From the cold cloths soaked in cool lemongrass to the highly attentive service we were made to feel like royalty from the first sip of Thai beer to the last bite of a chilled lychee dessert (the King's dessert) everything was beyond reproach. We started with satay and enjoyed pad thai in delicious edible bowls. The tenderloin curry was a perfect blend of spice and flavour. Family portions were plentiful and the beer was ice cold (given the 46 degree heat this was welcome). The Thai dancers that floated in and out of my peripheral vision only made the experience more authentic. Even the bathrooms were notable
4
I went with a large work group and some customers and we enjoyed the experience very much. The food is very good but the restaurant is a bit of a tourist trap and cashes in on the name. Having said this, the service was good and overall a great night out but not sure the experience matches the cost. The restaurant is also very noisy so it can be difficult with a group
5
Seven of us went for dinner and absolutely loved it. We ordered about ten dishes and were not disappointed in any of them. The restaurant is housed in what was an old barracks building and they have done everything they can to maintain its character. The room perfectly matches the food - absolutely gorgeous. Save up and give yourself a real treat
3
A restaurant set in a beautiful location with pleasing ambience marred by poor service and average food. The restaurant is set in the quiet ambience of Dempsey Hill in a nice colonial house. Its huge and can easily accomodate many diners. The waiters serve you & leave you alone. We had to call them twice to get ice for the drinks & then two ice buckets came 20 mins apart. The food while good was not great. Maybe having just returned form Bangkok influenced my tastebuds. They have a separate vegetarian menu, so plenty of choices for vegetarians
4
Had a great meal with family when we were staying with in Singapore.
Great food with great service, we had a beef dish that was so tender and tasty it just melts in your mouth. Would definitely eat here again.
4
The service and food was great - hadn't thought of Thai food to have so many vegetarian options - a little expensive but have to go there again - well done and keep it up
5
The setting, the interior, the food and the entertainment were first class heritage elegance, a must for any Singapore visitor
5
We eat there with friends on your stop over in Singapore and we really liked the style of the restaurant, the food and the service. The very high ceilings give you "room to breath". The food is not cheap but very good.
5
Having eaten here more than a dozen times, I can safely say that Jim Thompson restaurant is by far the best Thai food in Singapore. It has an extensive menu and they are willing to adjust dishes to accommodate guests desire - or lack thereof - for spicy heat. While the usual Thai standards are available, the specials are where you can sample exotic dishes. The restaurant - in a converted British military building - is spectacular and posh. Outside seating is available, but only recommended for late evening. Service ranges from good to very good. On most evenings the restaurant features Thai dancers and appropriate music. The restaurant is located near the Botanic Gardens and the US Embassy - set back from the main roads in a lush, quiet setting. I have taken numerous business colleagues there and never been disappointed
3
just went to Jim Thompson to celebrate a milestone birthday for a visitor to singapore and was a little disappointed in the restaurant. The cocktails are still good and the curries amazing, the pomela salad incredible. However I went there 2 years ago and the place has really aged and the atmosphere has dulled. The staff were not as polished as before and they also completely forgot about the cake we brought. In saying that a group of them came and sang happy birthday and that was a nice touch. It was a good night but not a great night. Its definitely great thai food (probably the best so far in singapore i have had) but good for date night and not for this type of occasion
4
Went with my friends for some nice Thai food, and was stunned by the charming decoration - a good mix of folklore Thai and modern design. The menu had many exquisite items that were mouth watering. While I loved the food, my Thai friends said that it was good, but not as good what they would normally considered authentic Thai. Service was great, but very over priced. I would bring business guests here, but may have second thoughts if we were to come among ourselves
3
Myself and my companion went to Jim Thompson restaurant looking forward to something special.However , upon arriving found the Maitre 'd fairly blase' about our reservation , not heeding our reservation requests. We had reserved a smoking table , and were directed to the crappiest table where you would have had to fire a signal flare to get any service.When we arrived the restaurant was essentially empty , bar about 3 tables of diners.We again pointed out that in our reservation that we had requested a smoking table and were then seated at a table , only to be asked to move to another table minutes later. Third times a charm?We ordered drinks and around 5 dishes and within the time it took for us to smoke about half a cigarette 4 dishes arrived ( approx 3 minutes. ) .It seemed pretty obvious that most of the dishes couldn't have been freshly cooked. Unless the Chef can cook 4 dishes in 1 and a half minutes, taking into consideration the the time it took the staff to take the order to the kitchen and then bring the dishes to our table.One particular prawn dish was very cold. When asked if they could make a fresh dish it came back 4 minutes later , obviously microwaved. The prawns resembled hockey pucks.It started to rain and at no point did staff ask us if we wanted to move to a table under cover.Some dishes were good , the Tom Yam being an example , but on the whole for the price there are much better options in Singapore.I would give the food a 2 , service a 2 out of 5.Pretty lame on the whole.Disappointed
4
The general opinion in the expat community is that you can eat a very enjoyable meal at Jim Thompson's, in a nice setting and in a quiet part of Singapore. Not the best I ever ate, but definitely very good. Service is OK, could be better, but what can you expect, this is Singapore! Wine is overpriced, as always here because of the outrageous liquor taxes, but all in all, the bill works out reasonabIe. I would say that you get value for money (once again, by local standards). The same meal in Bangkok would have cost a fraction of what I paid here, but I'm not complaining! That's what it takes to rub elbows with the affluent Singaporeans
5
My wife and I visited Singapore after spending a relaxing week in Phuket followed by a 5 day roundtrip cruise from Singapore. We dinned at Jim Thompson on the last evening of our vacation and had a truly amazing meal, far better than we experienced in Phuket, albeit that he meals in Phuket were good too. The setting and service were very good but the meal was very expensive
4
We really loved every dish we ordered, and our drinks as well. The atmosphere was lovely and the service was impeccable. It was expensive and we passed on the desserts because of this, but with this expectation, it was very enjoyable.
4
One of the better places for Thai food in Singapore. Very good service as you would expect and the food was by and large excellent. Only disappointment was the phad thai which was a little bland and greasy.
5
one of my favorites here. The venue is beautiful. The bar makes great drinks, the food was delicious and the service great. Could not fault it. It is expensive but you get what you pay for.
4
We had a nice dinner here, seated outdoors by the reflecting pool. Loved the atmosphere and design. Service was quite good by Singapore standards and the food was excellent. It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for.
3
The food was excellent. It is expensive especially for Thai but presentation and taste is great. I thought a couple of things needed improvement. 1) they refuse to serve free ice water. You want water with your meal, you pay $3++ for a 500ml bottle. 2) they serve wine by the glass or in a carafe 375ml - it too is expensive (this is Singapore) but bringing the bottle to the table to show the customer would add a lot to the experience and trusting they got the order right. 3) they didn't change the cutlery after entree. This is a particular bug bear of mine - why do some restaurants insist on doing this? My plate and cutlery are both used and yet you come and place the dirty cutlery back beside my placemat. I asked for clean cutlery (received an astonished look from the waitress) but in this type of restaurant I don't think you should have to. Overall good food but tarnished by these points - I won't be rushing back
2
Took my father here for a meal on his holiday to Singapore. Starters of Panadan Chicken was average, currys quite nice but had expected better for some reason (had better at Golden mile). Outdoor seating is very nice, Thai dancers, nice ambience. Service was poor, they forgot my drink order and asked 3 times for it, took over 25 mins to get it. When asked for water, my wife asked for tap which they dont do. Fair enough, however they brought a bottle of water which we didnt want. When my wife explained she didnt want it, the waitress argued that she had ordered bottled water. The argument ended when the waitress said " im not going to fight with you" and walked away. Spending 300 bucks and getting attitude is not a great night out. I must say that that may be specific to one waitress as there was aThai waitress who also served us that was exceptionally polite.Think my expectations for this restaurant and the fact i really wanted a nice dinner for my dad that didnt work out probably add to the negativity of this review

My husband had been to this restaurant before and wanted to let me experience the delicious food and special Thai decore. We started with the Tom Yum Goong soup, we had it with prawns and they were beautifully cooked. The mains were also very delicious and to finish we both had the coconut ice cream which was served in a coconut shell, and decorated with flowers. The whole ambience of the restaurant is delightful and the food was a real treat. We arrived early, just before 7pm without a booking and were fortunate enough to get a table. The waitress we had was very attentive, and the Thai dancer was a nice touch

I went to lunch with 3 friends at Jim Thompson's and was expecting to love it, as I have loved dining at the locations in Bangkok. The atmosphere is lovely, if not a tad formal for lunch, and the restaurant was less than half full the day we went. The waitress only offered us the lunch set menu, and no tap water is allowed, only bottled (read, they'll charge you for any water you want). Naturally, with these as the only options, we all ordered the set. It's a good value for a lot of food (given that the prices are on the high side) but more food than I would normally eat for lunch. Anyway, we ordered and after a bit of a comical ordering time, our order seemed to be understood. The food was yummy. Flat out, yummy. There were Thai dancers floating around the restaurant dancing, and it felt a bit odd, particularly since the restaurant was "sparsely populated" with diners. The downside for me? I had a coupon that I wanted to use for 15% off the meal (from Jim Thompson's loyalty card, no less) but when I tried to use it when it came time to pay, we were not allowed to, since we had a "promotional" lunch. After much to-do, politely asking to see the manager, I was rebuffed and told I could not use it. So I didn't, but was not terribly satisfied with the manager not trying to see my point at all (we were not offered any other menus, so how were we to know that anything else was on offer, etc.) It would not have hurt them to explain the context of the coupon, and then let us use it, but to know for the future. Hard to know when I'll go back, what with the bad taste in my mouth from the way it was handled. But the food was lovely, and for anyone else who wouldn't have any other expectations, the restaurant would probably be delightful

I have been searching for a great Thai restaurant in Singapore and so far this is my favorite. The food is excellent and there is a lot of variety on the menu. There are many good vegetarian options as well. Prices are on the higher side but I think it's worth it for the food. The outdoor setting is very pleasant. Service was great and the food came out surprisingly fast

This restuarant is fantastic. The food is amazing and the ambience and decor make you feel you are on holiday. You almost have to remind yourself you are in a mega city. Although it is a very romantic setting, I have had dinner here many times and for different occasions. This restaurant is suitable for every one. I took my three children there (all under 12) and they had a wonderful time. My 4 year old daughter particularly liked the dancers. They could see she was enjoying watching them so they came around quite often to show her the dance. The other time there was a big table of us for a business dinner and that was executed very well. Totally unobtrusive service but very efficient. The other time it was more intimate and although there was a big table near us, again it didn't affect our night at all. I highly recommend the salad with this fruit in it called Pomelo. It is like a grapefruit but on steroids but much sweeter and not tart at all. I have to say this restaurant is a MUST on any itinerary

If you are an expert Thai gourmet avoid it, it's good but far from real. The prices are absurd.

i eat thai food almost once a week at home and a lot in general including plenty in the many times i have been to thailand. this was the best thai food since i was last in Thailand in Jan. when in singapore you must go here if you like thai food. my only complaint was they were sold out of young coconuts when i went due to massive group of about 100 people whom taken them all. service was very good

The restaurant is in a nice setting on Dempsey Hill and the high ceilings make a nice ambiance. We had lunch there nd enjoyed the food, straight forward, well presented. Only the deep fried snapper could have had a bit more "fried" to it, as it drowned in the veggies and sauce. Service was attentive but never too much. Good place and very convenient also for a lunch break

My husband and I went for a special night out and we thoroughly enjoyed. Yes it is pricey but I was perfectly happy with every single dish and appetizer we ate! THe service was great, maybe too good because I would have liked to slow it down a bit and savor the evening. Inside and out was tastefully decorated, Next time I would like to try eating outdoors. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a en evening to remember

Both atmosphere and the hospitality of the service staff reminds you of amazing Thailand. Decorations and furniture are intricately designed as will attract you to buy some of their pieces ( abruptly, they do sell it).The Thai Salad salad that I ordered via buffet were made by a Thai chef was as authentic as what I had at the street of Bangkok yet serve with a class.I suggest to order the "pink lotus tea" where they will drop a ball-like-dried-flowers into crystal pot and after a minute you will see...well that amazed me and that's for you to find out

I have always love Thai food and especially the hospitality of the Thai service. The only thing Thai here, is the hardware. The design of the the restaurant, the service personnel and dancers in thai outfits. Top marks for the design and ambience of the restuarant. The rest is downhill - expensive, poor service, and the food is edible Thai food. Even some of the average Thai restuarants in Thailand can rival this.My foreigner friend (a seaonsoned traveler around the world) who introduced me to the restaurant unbashedfully commented that it is for the foreigners.I will not come here again. I love Jim Thompson but I will stick to the Jim Thompson in Thailand. There are much better Thai restuarants in Singapore

This is a beautiful setting and restaurant and well worth the visit for that. The food was very tasty and well executed. Fish cakes were a bit chewy but that should not be allowed to detract from the excellent and well balanced mains. Staff were lovely.The wine charges!!! Ooouch! $90 plus dollars for what would cost $10 dollars in a UK supermarket
5
The atmosphere is better than the food. This is a beautiful historic building with both indoor and outdoor seating. This country side area a bit outside the city bussel is worth the shoprt cab ride. I always order the steamed fish; the appetizers are a bit greasy and too fried. Salads are delicious but ask for a fire extinguishe

Me and my wife love thaifood. This place is bit expensive but the food is good. And for me even though I know I can get Thai food at buggies but still this place I awsome. The service is good, the decor and ambience is awsome. And Ofcourse the food is good. What is o crib about. Love it..

I don't agree that this restaurant is over-priced for Singapore. The main courses start at approx $20 (we had the green curry at $20) and the wine list starts at $80. The cocktails are $20 as well (the Thai Martini is amazing!) The restaurant is beautiful and makes you feel like you are dining somewhere really special. We sat outside by the candle lit pond and the service was top-notch. The food is very good and is presented very well. You will of course get cheaper Thai food else where and maybe you will even get food as good as this, cheaper else where too but the whole dining experience is what makes this place stand out from the crowd. It is certainly one of the best restaurants in Singapore

Hot wine
Cold food.
Hmmm not bad for a $300 meal.
Lol. Staff laughed and said sorry.
$300 sorry?

My husband and I had a lovely night at Jim Thompsons. The food was impeccable. The service was the best we've had since living in Singapore. The prices were very reasonable for the quality and portion size of the food. We will definitely return.

Really good food - great selection of dishes and hearty - not a poser, small dish place. Good service too and excellent ambiance - really enjoyable.

Wonderful food, service and setting. Worth the trip in the taxi.

We had a business dinner at Jim Thompson and arrived to a very spacious courtyard with two ladies doing a traditional Thai dance as I walked in. The outside seeding was plentiful relative to typical restaurants in Singapore. Their main dining was quite spacious as well. We ordered thet typical Thai food - pomelo salad; phad thai; chicken cashew; steamed fish; soft shelled crabs; chicken curry and of course, mango/sticky rice for dessert. Service was attentive. We were feeling a bit warm and brought out beautiful antique fans to air our room. It was a great food experience and will plan to be back

It's pretty, but the food was expensive relative to other Thai restaurants and it was hit or miss. The fish cakes were tough and rubbery, but the pad thai was good and fresh. Drinks are ridiculously expensive. Cocktails are above SGD 20. Inside the restaurant is very loud; better to eat outdoors. And, finally, the service was the most haughty and unfriendly I've encountered in Singapore is a very long time.So, if you are on an expense account, this place is probably OK., But, really, there are better Thai restaurants in Singapore

Having visited this restaurant a few times now, I really do not understand what the fuss is about. Granted, the indoor area is nicely decorated, but the outdoor area lacks atmosphere. Even though the interior is well deigned, the acoustics are terrible; we were in relatively small group of 5 but it was virtually impossible to participate in any conversation at the opposite end of the table. The food is adequate but many dishes were a bit bland. Moreover, there service is truly awful; the waiting staff are pleasant but extremely slow, often invisible. Everything, such as requesting help booking taxis, appeared to be a little too much trouble. There are much better alternatives in Singapore

...go for Jim Thompson on Dempsey Hill.It does not sound very Thai, but it is arguably the best one in Singapore. The location is unique, the interior stunning and the food sensational.We were four of us and had something like 12 different dishes all together and there was not a single one which was "just average". Interesting tastes, fantastic Thai or Asian spices, excellent meat and a creative chef who put all that together in a very appealing way. The waiters are knowledgable with a great sense of humour. It was not cheap all in all but worthwhile experiencing Thompson-Thai-style food. There is a possibility to sit outside as well, but opt for inside-seating. The atmosphere is special and air-conditioning makes air cool but not cold

Set on Dempsey Hill in an elegant old colonial army barrack building, the Jim Thompson restaurant is ideal for a quiet, elegant dinner. Inside the ceilings are high, the seats and tables are comfortable, and the food and wine are first class. Outside tables offer the peace of dinner under tropical trees. The menu has a wide variety of dishes you would expect from a fine Thai restaurant: yellow, red and green curries, noodles of all sorts, seafood, meat dishes and salads. The green papaya salad is a tangy, spicy start, as is the larb (minced chicken). The curries are very tasty and as hot or mild as you like them. The mango and sticky rice dessert is a perfect ending. The service was excellent too, and our waitress even asked how much time we wanted between courses (so nice not to feel rushed)

This was our first visit and from the moment we arrived we were stunned. The decoration of the restaurant, the moving cloud like lights above the buffet, the beautiful Thais dancers, everything was great. The service is very good, quick, correct and invisible when you don't need them. The food however was mediocre, cooked well but flat taste, not very well made up. Price is high for a Thai restaurant. I will probably come back with friends or colleagues because of the atmosphere and service, not because of the food. Recommend to sit inside so you can enjoy the decoration
5
great place to eat excellent food! Service is fabulous! Will go back next time we visit Singapore!
5
The space alone is enough to go. Great atmosphere in Dempsey. Food is extremely well prepared and served. Service is great. Everything is phenomenal until you get the check. Very pricey for Thai.
4
Great mix of service, ambience and delicious Thai food. Great setting, definitely worth a visit.
5
Book your table indoors - the interior is worth it! Went with a colleage from Bangkok as he knew the authentic food.. Its not cheap but more than worth it... Good for buiness but also romantic dinners

I have been here many,many times and it has always been very good. I love to sit outside and to watch the Thai dancer. Don't pay attention to the grouchy reviews. It's worth a visit to decide for yourself.

Tucked away in a small part of Dempsey Road, Singapore, the Jim Thompson Thai Restaurant. The experience is marvelous and food authentically Thai.Surrounding the restaurant, there was a beautiful aroma of pandan leaves and lemongrass from the garden surrounding the restaurant. At the main entrance, there was 2 Thai dancers in their traditional Thai dance costumes, who greeted us in traditional Thai "Wa". I almost felt that I was in Thailand again.The interior of the restaurant is beautiful, with its high ceiling, decor, carefully placed lighting and Thai ornaments.The best thing of this place is the food. Firstly, you must try the Thompson Mojito. It is simply a lovely blend of classic mojito infused with flavors of Thailand.For starters, we had the Khao Tang (rice crackers with shrimp dip), Tom Yam Goong (Tom Yam Soup) and Yam Woon Sen (Spicy Glass Noodle Salad). They were excellent!Just a note, the Tom Yam Goong was a bit too spicy for me, a local Singaporean. I suggest you ask the chef to tone down the spiciness of the soup if you don't like a burning tounge!For main course, we had the deep fried groupa (fish) with basil leaves and stir fired green vegetables. The fish was very fresh and the veg was normal.The feast de le resistance was the desert. We had fresh fruit and a serving of durian sticky rice. The durian, an acquired taste, was excellent when paired with Jim Thompson's sticky rice with coconut sauce.I now know why this restaurant has been selected as One of Singapore's Best Thai Restaurant from 2009-2012 by The Miele Guide.However, the pricing is on the high side but worth the visit to celebrate a special someone's birthday

The title says it all. There are few restaurants in Singapore with this kind of quiet, charming decor that don't overlook an 8-lane highway or a shopping mall escalator. This one definitely does the trick as the decorations are beautiful (shame about the concrete floor though) and it's very comfortable even inside (I'm allergic to freezing aircon so normally prefer to sit outside). There are some Thai dancers doing traditional dances and moving about the area... it wasn't as uncomfortable as I thought it would be, but still a bit weird.Service was AMAZING in every respect, which is not something you find very often in Singapore. I won't list all the small things, but the staff are really wonderful and you'll just have to take my word for it.I thought the food was really nice, my partner was slightly less happy but still very satisfied and we agreed we'd come back with friends and family. There is a full vegetarian menu for those so-inclined, and the desserts are really nice too (mango sticky rice or warm taro in sweetened coconut milk for example), which isn't always easy to achieve with Thai food. Glasses of wine are generously filled.It's really pricey though so bring a couple credit cards (their website says S$50-70 per person for dinner excluding drinks, which is about what we paid for a 3-course meal)

The restaurant is very nice and comfortable. It is a great place to entertain guests and it is reasonably quiet to have a conversation. However, the food is just ok. There are better quality Thai food alternatives if you are more interested in good Thai food. Will I go back again? Not likely.

Located in an old British Colonial Build at Dempsey Hill, JIm Thompson is located in a beatiful garden with outdoor seatings. The food is modern Thai, colorful, Spicy and the plating can be surprising. Is a conveninet place for a romantic evening or just for a relaxed dinner with friends.

Jim Thompson is worth a visit for the ambiance alone - and the food isn't bad either although also not cheap. My colleague and I shared a selection of dishes and found them all to be very good albeit not unforgettable. The standout dish for me was the minced chicken larb. I would avoid the hot and sour chicken soup, which featured a large chunk of inedible chicken. I could not break it down into something small enough to get into my mouth. I hate when I am served meat at a restaurant (especially in a soup!) that I am unable to actually eat without getting out a hacksaw. Other than the soup, the meal was very good but I doubt I will return
