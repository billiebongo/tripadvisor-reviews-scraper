Taken care of by Rob and the Team for my 40th. Wonderfully cooked meat and great craft beer. The key lime pie topped it off. Thanks again.

I eat many burgers and I was surprised to order THE BEST cheeseburger I can recall having eaten. Perfection in the pickles, smokey juicy meat and perfect sauce. I should have ordered two. The iced tea was notable also. I will return.

We went for dinner after reading quite good reviews about the place in local internet channels. The restaurant is located in the business district of Singapore and is a modest sized establishment. The service is good and polite, if not friendly. We found the food to be generally overpriced with relatively small portion sizes. For example, we paid $9 for one smoked sausage, cut into 5 pieces, as an appetizer. For the main courses, we paid $28 for a 5 inch by 1.5 inch beef brisket and about the same price for a pork ribs dish with 5 ribs. There were no steak items below $95. On the brighter side, we got half a chicken for $20, and some well-done potato fries. The quality of the food was good, if not awesome
