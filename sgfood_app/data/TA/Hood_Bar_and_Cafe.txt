5
Loving the ambience and songs played. Will always return for a visit with friends. Staff were friendly too
1
Arrived starving. ordered a pizza (18$) and Hamburger with bacon (19$).The pizza came without tomato sause, was less than average.Hamburger arrived with cheese (while the menu says "with bacon"). One of the worst burgers we ate.There was a band but they weren't interesting.Service was below average, high prices that just don't justify.Maybe for a beer it could be nice, Definitely not for food though
3
Hood bar and cafe has a nice atmosphere. The night I went it had a local band playing which was pretty good. The tapas are not bad too
4
Awesome place to get cheap drinks during the happy hour! Food is a little pricey but taste good! Try the spicy frog legs, you wouldn‚Äôt regret it!
4
Enjoying our time at Hood Bar at Bugis + with live band at night. I've been to this outlet for many times with good live band performing. Different band every nights.
3
Located on the fifth floor of a medium-end shopping mall this is quite a large bar with a band performing live music. They do a mixture of wersten pop and Chinese songs. Entertaining.
5
If you like good beer, good food. You also like. Order mala frog leg. It's good. Very nice. You sure like
5
A great place to have an outing with friends. You can chill with your friends who love eargasm music here, or savour delicious food with your loved ones. On a side note, the salted egg pasta with soft shell crab here is irresistible!

Ordered the 1-for-1 from the app and was told the promo was over. Ordered har cheong chicken wings and sambal spicy prawn pizza. Pizza didn't have sambal at all, came without side plates and utensils and we had to request for them. Service was not on par with the previous experience (on a weekday). Probably came at the wrong day (?) Band was singing mandopop and it wasn't really our genre. Nonetheless this place has the best location, pop by anytime as it is located just inside Bugis+
5
The music is great. Good for emo people. Great for healing broken hearts and meeting new people. Will recommend to similar broken hearted peers.
5
Good food with the new fusion between western and Chinese. Like the char siew pizza, serve variety of drinks.

Spacious, Affordable Beer Prices. Great Price for Single Malt Whiskey Lovers. Great Sound system for a space like this. Enjoy the Jaming night on Tues for customers to join in the fun of playing music. Prompt & Great Service. And The Service Staff even suggest & change for me a better beer promotion after I ordered. A Great place For Friends gather to chill out & enjoy great time together.
5
I came with another friend because of a fave voucher promotion. Ordered 4 mains to share between two of us and it was very filling. Perhaps one main is good enough for one person if you are going to drink also. Portions are not extremely huge but they aren't tiny for sure. We were both very full and bloated after devouring all the 4 mains.The seafood xo aglio olio was quite special. They seem to use dried scallop bits or something like that to garnish, nice mixture. The best deal for the fave voucher was the lamb. Nicely cooked and seasoned, it was not hard at all. Unfortunately the steak was sold out, so didn't get to try that. The sambal prawn pizza was so-so but that's probably because it went cold when I ate it. Otherwise the mix is good and matching. All the food went well with the cider I bought.Yet more impressive is the live music. We were lucky to get a front seat in front of the band playing, right smack in the middle. It was not too loud and oh boy, the vocalists were real good! Nice mix of music, both English and Chinese.I will definitely remember this place and come back
5
Nice music. Good food. A good way to spend the night with my hubby. Thurs night has many of our favourite songs. Highly recommended.

A bunch of lousy drunk customer was taken over the performance stage . I don't really mind if they sang well , but sadly this is not the case .. I end up paying a premium price for my drinks and suffered listening those "song performance

Good music and beer pricing is reasonable. This is my second time here and enjoy my time here! They have live band every night, definitely coming back on other days to hear out the other singers!
3
Visited the establishment on 5May2017. In general, a nice place to chill. The drinks are a good deal between 5-8pm with a 1-for-1 deal. There is a good varity of finger food to go with our drinks. The only complaint we have is that the band did not play to expectation. The first set started at 7pm and ended at 7.15pm , the second set started at 8.50pm when the guitarist appeared. Not sure if that is suppose to be that way. Will try to come back to give them a second chance.
5
Solid food. Love the Har Cheong Chicken Wings!
Music, Alcohol, Good Food, Darts and Company make it a fantastic atmosphere
4
Nice place to chill with live band...nice atmosphere ...the luncheon fries is nice...variety of snacks...darts machine available...
5
Good atmosphere with drinks promotion and live singing performance . Great food and crowds . Convenient to reach place . Within shopping center itself

So far so good! Pity the bass sometimes overpowered the vocalist voice...
Beer is quite cheap with promos and nice Kronenbourg draft!
4
Must try their Spicy Challenge "Ma La" Deep Fried Frog Legs!!! Awesome live band, mixture of english and chinese songs!

4
Awesome place to chill out with buddies~~~support the local bands! And awesome deals! MUSIC HERE is amazing. Ambience is amazing and staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly. Worth the visit! There are a lot of choices for the beer, location is convenient and the live band is the bom
2
This is the worst place that I have visited.The service staff simply stuff the tiny table with the food that we have ordered.When requested to change to a larger table they simply refused. This will be the first and only time I am visiting the place.The lowest star in this app is 2. Else I will give it a zero star
5
Heard about a good performance ( Fried Ice and Ray Anthony) today, I decided to have my lunch while enjoying goods music. It's really great as the Hainanese pork chop angel hair pasta was delicious and the drinks are reasonably price and good. The music is exceptional!!!If you like love music, good food on a lazy Sunday afternoon, this is the place to be!
4
Nice music and good promotion for beer . Location is very near to train station . Good place to. Chill
4
Great venue with good live music. Food really tasty. Trendy decor and nice staff. Lots of drink promotions.
5
A great place to chill with friends after a long week of work. reasonable price and great ambience! A great bar with delicious food too
5
Really quiet (other than the music, better than a noisy bar!!) and nice to spend time over here with friends! The food is rather good as well!! :) enjoyed myself here.
5
Good chill out place with good live band ambience! Good beer promotions with good singing with a large dining area! Will definitely come back again.
5
Perfect place to chill at night and have great local-western fusion. XO aglio olio is too awesome ^_^
5
Where can you find a all night one for one beers on a Saturday night ? Nice band with good crowd. My first time here and I will be back..... thanks hood bar for the great evening ....
5
A really enjoyable place to have a drink after a long day at work. Great music and best of all cheap drinks during happy hour :)
4
Nice ambience , food is great n I love the live band . There's even darts !! I hope there's more table games and lower table seats
5
Came here on a Friday with some friends to listen to music, have a couple beers, and play some cards. The variety of music played by the bands was awesome -- I'm writing this review to Bohemian Rhapsody.Beer deals are about standard for what you'll find in Singapore. There are dart machines if you want to get off your feet for a while
5
I love Mondays at Hood as it is free oysters for ladies!! Oysters are average in size and very succulent!
4
Good place to chill with your friends over a cold beer and good music. Band was great when I visited on a Wednesday night. Bar bites were satisfying too.
5
Came here for a band jam and was delighted at the quality of food and the feels of the ambience! Definitely worth a try!!! :)
5
What more can you expect when you hang out with friends or for just business meeting . This is really a great place, love the way they promote local talents. Awesome place to be in !!
4
Good place to hang out with friends. Good music, darts and other games. They support local artist too

5
Awesome place with good music. Spacious and good place to chill out. And check out the oyster promotions on Monday!!

I would rate in between average and very good, but leans toward average. They took 20-25 min to serve my beer alongside my food. They could have served the drink earlier. 10-15 min after my order, waitress asked if I ordered and then said she would actually put in my order. They offered 1 for 1 beer, essentially 17 SGD for two pints which is good. Promotion beer selection isn't that good, but I had a Malaysian stout which was better than I thought; like a milder Guinness. Their policy is to serve both beers at once, which means the 1 you are not drinking will warm up due to SG's heat. The Margherita pizza I had was very good. The featured live rock band had skiller performers, a tight sound and fun atmosphere. Original SG music with British ex-pat singer and GreenDay-ish influences. But I couldn't hear the vocals which was too bad.Last thing, I wish there was WiFi. But overall OK experience, I may come back
4
This is a dark live band pub-ish place, but the food is surprisingly good and the play an electric mix of mandarin and English pop and rock music.We were happily surprised at the standard of the live music and are back for hopefully more good musi
4
We come all the time all because of Nicole! She provides the best service.
Nice place and nice music to hang out. We like bands. Visited a few times and also recommended to our friends!
4
Great place to hang out with friends over good music and good! The live bands were great. Highly recommended!! Can play darts as well makes it a bonus here
5
Good music, good vibes!!! With 3 dart machines, $1/game only! Pretty decent food as well! 3 Asashi for only $20!
5
Didn't expect to find this nice bar to chill with live music. Price very reasonable. The only thing I don't fancy is that they only have high chair.
3
Not a bad place but it's hard to find a real good band in SG. It's fun but not a place I would go back right away for the band. Bangkok and even HCMC have better places.
4
Good place to hang out. With good beer and good music. Good place to play darts too. Worth visitibg.
5
Great place to hang out, great food, great live music and great service.
Will recommend friends to come here.
5
Great band and the music rocks! also enjoy the comfortable ample seating and easy parking. Drinks are reasonably priced and decent.

We were brought the bill shortly before happy hour finished. Assumed they wanted us to pay for this and then start a fresh bill. Fine fair enough. Gave the credit card and we didn't see them again until i questioned them about it half an hour later. A pint of Carlsberg at happy hour is about $9 once included the taxes that we weren't aware about. So therefore you'll be paying about $18 for a pint of Carlsberg when happy hour is finished. If that's your idea of reasonable then all the best to you. Also the place is in a shopping mall on the fifth floor, so doesn't really have the feel of a music venue, which is why we went there in the first place as we'd read about live music every night
4
Had the salted egg pasta with soft shell crab and the truffle fries. The salted egg pasta with soft shell crab was really good. The sauce was tasty and the soft shell crab was delicious. The truffles fries was really really good and the portion is just nice for the 2 of us. The ambience of the bar is really nice and the music isn't too loud. It is a great place for friends to hang out and couples to just chill and enjoy the live band.
4
Heard a fair bit about this place. I like they promote local bands to showcase. Food is interesting- local Flavours with a twist. Charming ambience. Location just outside the main scene so go for those who wants a night out but without fighting with crowds
4
Sambal Prawn pizza rocks! Clement & Amanda rocks! Rocks rocks rocks rocks rocks rocks rocks.... (need 100 characters so this review can be submitted)
5
Great place to hang out and celebrating parties. Nice live music!! Promotion like 1 for 1 beers. Delicious food & snacks!! A must place to come!!
4
We love the finger food here especially the top shell, chicken skin & chicken wings
The staffs are friendly
The live band performance is very entertaining too
5
First time here and I love this place alot. Great band and food(highly recommend the frog leg) AWESOME
4
"It‚Äôs A Great place ! Music and live band were good! Drinks and food were reasonably priced! Crowd is diverse and fun loving!
4
Yummy legs! Go for level 2 spiciness
A little too loud for my liking, but music is good. Great chill out place at night. Location is also very convenient
5
Singer loupeixin is great!! Awesome sambal prawn pizza! Salted egg soft shell crab pasta was ok to share but not solely for one. One for one happy hour perks üç∫üçª
4
Great place for gathering with friends!! Nice ambience with bank, darts counters. The place is easy to find as well. Would definitely recommend my friends over.
4
Located at Bugis plus,bMonday have 3 fresh oyster for ladies after u order more than $20. Olster fresh and nice too.We like hood bar on Monday because of the live band as well. The band name is Eat, Drink Main. They really can sing well.Nat And Fatt is not around and replace by Juni this round, he not bad too.
5
The food is great specially the pasta and the fish. cozy place and nice band- can sing different language. Good to hang out with friends specially if u are a large group. Very Nice and relaxing place. Service is good and fast.
5
Lovely ambience and hearty local music! Staff are friendly and nice and the drinks are not far too ridiculously priced. That's always appreciated.
5
Ambience was good. Location is easily accessible. Tables are spaced out so it is not too crowded. We came here solely for live music and food.
5
MUSIC HERE is amazing. Ambience is amazing and staff is incredibly accommodating and friendly. Worth the visit! There are a lot of choices for the beer, location is convenient and the live band is the bomb
5
Nice ambience and good live music band.
Been here a few times and really enjoy.
Love the place and never fail to visit every month.
4
The location is very accessible and near the MRT.
It's my first time and still trying to get the feel.
Music variety is broad.
So far so good!
5
Awesome place that is filled with great music, booze and food! Love that they have different bands everyday! Every band is awesome! Highly recommended!
5
 Good service , yummy spicy frog legs. The Carlsberg beer is cold and good. Some bars that I go to serve beers that are not cold enough. What is beer when it isn't cold enough? Recommend all to come here. Live band is good as well, even till midnight.
3
Just found a good place for good food and music. At least the crowd is not rowdy. Different bands played on different night, that make the place more refreshing and alway something new to look forward to. The variety of food available is extraordinary with plenty to choose from. I like the pan fried fish. Next time will try the48 hrs Pork Kunckle. Welcome to the club
1
Went to this cafe for drink and view euro game match with my friend. It is a nice place with decent food but the service was bad and questionable way in handling your credit card. In short, I was in "no idea" where my card for the whole 90 mins game. Then they finally confessed that the card was given to someone else who signed off my bill (so that he can get his free meal!). It all started when I realized why it told so long for my card and bill to sign off. Then I asked the waitress, she brought me another bill(wrong items and maybe for another table). I told her that I already passed them my card and waiting for them to return. It got me so piss off as they tried to insist that I never gave them my card,then follow by "I already passed you back your card, then "told me that you signed off your bill(when it wasn't my signature at all" ). Finally, they told me to cancel my card and will void off this payment. This sound like a make-up for what I have went through but the thing is that you should sound/show that you are truly sorry for what has happened. We tried to order other food/drink and was hoping they provide some on the house or discount to us since no one has enough cash ( we usually use card to pay). The waitress said their supervisor asked us to use other card if we do not have enough cash.(who still dare to use another card to pay if you have lost one just moment ago). I think a bar with good service or at least most bar will ask what else we can do for you or provide some free drinks to at least help the customer calm down after he went through this. NOT TELLING YOUR CUSTOMER TO USE ANOTHER CARD OR ASK YOUR FRIEND PAYS FIRST. WE ARE NOT LOOKING FOR FREE FLOW DRINK OR ANYTHING MORE. JUST AT LEAST SHOW THAT YOU ARE MAKE SORRY ABOUT THIS. YOU WASTED MY TIME TRYING TO FIND MY CARD AND I START TO THINK IF SOMEONE GOING TO USE MY CARD FOR OTHER ILLEGAL PURPOSE. MY OWN OPINION is if you are looking to get a new replacement card or a free meal(if they lost your card).. can consider try this place
5
Came with my friends and we enjoyed the food, beer n live band. The seafood pizza have lots of ingredients and was great and the ambience is nice. Awesome! :)
5
Great place to chill out with friends. Live band is awesome too! Darts lover should come here too!!!!
5
Great original bands, love that they show epl too. A great place to hang or with friends after work. Located at a busy shopping CENTRE. Worth a visit!
3
1. Friday night band is excellent
2. Cheap draught beer (1 for 1 before 8pm)
3. Strategic location (Level 5 Bugis+)
4. Ample seats available
4
A cosy and relaxing bar with good music and service. I visit monthly to enjoy the drinks, live band and the luncheon meat fries üåπüåπüåπ

I'm a regular at Hood and I've always love everything about Hood at every visit. The bands especially, followed by the food and the service. The DJ is the only one thing I detest about my favourite joint. Hood's story: "A place where like-minded people who really dig great live music and free-flow art hang out.... this is the place where friends catch up, colleagues gossip and lovers meet. This is the canvas where art flourishes and people paint memories. This is our hood."If Hood's management team is really reading this review, know this - the DJ is drowning out the atmosphere and is robbing us of the opportunity to catch up in between sets. I'm paying for the awesome live band and I want to tell my friends how much I love the bands and their music. What I don't want to pay for is loud club music. If I wanna dance and not talk I'll go to a dance club, not Hood.Give us back our hood. DJ, lower your club music and we are friends, again
4
Came here on 2 occasions and love the fact that they give locals bands a platform to be heard. Also, great food selection. Friendly and efficient service from staff. Music between band sets are WAYY TOO LOUD. My friends and I sit out that in the smoking area, so minus 1 star for that
4
Saw a UK band here and had a good and beverage package. The manager was great, very personable. The sound is remarkably good for such a small venue. The food was fine; finger food was standard fried fare, but the pizza was pretty good. The house red wine was also surprisingly good. For live music, this place is solid.
5
If you're looking for a good music live, exquisite spicy frog legs and affordable drinks, you have arrived in the right place. Hood is one of bar/clubs, where you can hang out with your friends and never get bored. Excellent food and good service are only a few of highlights here. Step by and enjoy the atmosphere

Probably went on a quiet night but found the bar deserted and the decor and atmosphere nothing to write home about. Prices reasonable but located on the top floor of a shopping mall does not help it a great deal.

Great music and food at affordable prices - Definitely recommended for friends and lovers of live music! Convenient location and good choice of food.

Preposterously awesome place. And luncheon fries. Awesome ambience. Great local band and music. Friendly service staffs.
5
This place has great music and more importantly, the ambience for perfect gatherings with best buddies. Come for the live band and drinks.

This used to be one of my favourite hangouts with different groups of friends for a casual meetup over a few drinks. Decided to drop by for a simple dinner and a drink. I was initially surprised by how the menu has shrunk and serves a limited variety of food now. Decided to order a drink too and was now amused (and shocked) by how the cocktail looks half drunk before I even drank it. Price of the drink was definitely the same but not the quantity nor quality. Talk about the glass being half-empty...All the best to the Hood. I will not visit again unless someone else initiates a gathering there

Hood Bar and Cafe is very centrally located and accessible via public transport, with great bar food like luncheon fries with nacho cheese, truffle fries with parmasen cheese and parsley, and Har Cheong Chicken Wings! Their drinks are also reasonably priced. Best of all, they open during Chinese New Year and most public holidays. If you're looking for a place to chill to some local bands' music, be sure to check out Hood Bar and Cafe

Amazing live bands on Friday! Amanda and the band is just fantastic! Tried the Mala frog legs, just pure addiction! There's tower discount and it's super worth it! Come visit!
5
Came here to chill and relax after having a hearty dinner!
There's live band, rowdy crowds, nice music and most of all free luncheon meat fries!
5
Was here after work again. Spacious bar with great music! The tapas was good and food never fails to disappoint me! And they have 1 for 1 drinks before 8!
3
Didn't quite enjoy the food; there are better choices in Bugis+. The music, however, was great (Friday night). A good place to chill with friends as the place was not too packed, drinks were reasonably priced and you could also play darts.
4
Nice environment with good food n live band . With balcony with good landscape view . Open till late . "
5
This is my 1st visit and I already see myself coming back. Fantastic music with a list of sinfully tempting tapas. A great crowd and place that unpretentiously immerse with the live music.
5
Good and nice music with best friends ! Will come here often! Love the tower konenbourg 1664!:)
Convinient and smoking area is just outside!
5
Came go celebrate my BFF birthday after dinner. This place never fail to disappoint me. The atmosphere is very nice and what I like about this place is casual attire. One can come here in any attire. Foods is ok but drinks are at reasonable price. Tuesday is jam night. Bring your own instruments down if you fancy some jamming session.
5
Great atmosphere, great music & great performers.
Staff are friendly and attentive too.
Will visit again.
5
Great place to jam on Tuesday nights! Great band and relax atmosphere
A place to gather with friends, drink, listen to great music and go on the stage to sing
5
This is by far the best chill out place and the promotions are awesome. Came with my friends and we had a good time playing darts as well
4
I guess 6 months I never been here.. Today revisit and the octopus still so yummy... Cheapest place to hang out for Friday night...
5
Love the place, band is awesome on a Friday night, nuff said. Was there with drinks and the band really rocked the night away. will definitely go back. and the spam fries were just delicious.
5
This place is packed with great food, drinks and a great avenue for live music. Usually here for the live music as the bosses really believe in supporting not only local music but music of all kinds.The finger food has very interesting choices. I particularly like their luncheon meat fries :)
5
I randomly picked it for casual drink but it surprised me that the live band there is awesome, I'm from HK and can't imagine the band can sing many Cantonese and mandarin songs, we ordered some songs to the band and they know, it's entirely different experience compared to those in Clarke quay, the atmosphere there is super fantastic. Price is reasonable, the place is large enough n it's not really crowded.
5
Fantastic place to chill out with friends and awesome live band! The ambience is good for relax after a hard day at work. Awesome service crew staff, paying good attention when in times of need and service. Reasonable price for drinks and the food is decent for sharing!

I've come to listen to SINGAPORE CHAR SIEW BAO ... with Ruby singing. We enjoyed our night here a lot. I love this CAFE concept ... to promote LOCAL BANDS & SINGERS. Good Job & Keep It Up. The Truffles Thick Fries & the Shirley Temple Mocktail is good
3
Nice little bar located at the top floor (5th) of Bugis + mall. It's open late so if you're in the area and looking for something to do besides whats near bugis station on Rochor Rd this maybe a good option. Mostly bar food with some very good cold beer. Live music everyday although we arrived 1 hour before closing time and the band was already packing up. Also have dart board but on that same night there was some sort of tournament so no way to get in on that also.If I was in the area and didn't want to venture off too far I would visit but seems like Cheers so I would not make a special trip since most seem like they frequent quite often
4
My hubby and I came for the food after looking through HungryGoWhere and we were not disappointed!
The food that we ordered were all so tasty and the luncheon meat fries were absolutely to die for. Leave all thoughts of dieting at the door!
5
Pretty decent music by local bands!!!!!!! Good place to hang out with decent seating in the place! Convenient located at Bugis!

Visited Hood Bar for the second time and it was the best decision made! Awesome band,awesome food and drinks! :)The wings here was delicious, my friends and I really enjoyed its succulent taste. It was so good we had to get seconds.We had pints of beers, red wine as well as white wine! It's been awhile since we drank, and we are glad that we are having quality drinks after such a long time. What more can we ask for? This is LIFE! Beloved friends, awesome drinks, delicious food, and wonderful band. This could be the most perfect combination in our life time

Pretty cool place for gathering with friends. All bands playing that night were pretty good! Food were pretty decent as well

Found on TripAdvisor. It's on level 5, so keep riding the escalator. Went early on a weekday, so no real music playing. Decent selection of beer and cider. Good food; definitely try the luncheon meat fries! Even though the place was not busy, had to flag down the waitress to pay our bill. Overall, I would come back.
3
Live music place in a central part of Singapore. Be prepared to pay premium for it though, but you can count it as cover charge. Cheers!
5

Nice environment, pizza here is very delicious and reasonable price. Worth to spend ur precious time here !!
5
I have been there for couples of time because of cheap happy hour especially for erdinger beer. I can't find it at any other place. Their happy hour start from 5pm till 9pm. Different band perform different day and all of the live band are fantastic. I love to watch the band on Tuesday Jacob and the gang. Well done to entertain all the guest.Will visit again for beer and their live band!!
4
I could say that so far this is the place I frequently go to to get a decent drink while listening to a live band (check out the band playing on Fridays). Easily gets packed and crowded from 9pm onwards on Friday and Saturday nights. A great place to hang out with friends and celebrate birthdays. They offer a wide selection of cocktails, beers, and wine (prosecco is in the menu!) and a variety of snacks/food. My booze of choice is the Long Island Tea - bartenders give generous mix of alcohol. For $18 it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s definitely worth it
5
Love the decor and the live bands..what I love most is the great food that goes with the awesome booze promotions they have running through out the night. I came here many times, and some days I just pop over for dinner to enjoy their Happy hour, with beers at $5. I am addicted to their chicken wings and pasta!  Hugh place with lots of seats, the only place with a hugh screen that runs soccer matches, etc. If you celebrate your birthday, you will get a free drink, the infamous Adios Mutherfocker cocktail. :) Great place to be at, great atmosphere, really chill and makes you feel right at home. Do try their Mala Frog legs
4
Good experience here with very good music. We Will be here again soon with our friends on a Saturday night, with beer and all!
5
Came here with family to celebrate Mother's day! Great music and finger food! Thanks to the staff for helping to find a table despite missing our reservation
5
Good music, food and atmosphere!=) A great place to chill and hang out with your friends after a long day of hardwork!=)
5
Great singer! Good atmosphere in central location. Not expensive to hang out whole night. Give it a try!

Erdinger beer and finger food are just perfect after a long day in city. Highly recommended to go with friends or even solo. Unique setup and cosy environment to relax. Nice Live bands to keep you entertain for the night.
5
Great food, great vibes,great live music! Probably the best live music venue in singapore! Lotsa love!
5
Going there on Tuesday is a treat.The resident band, Singapore Char Siew Baos amazes with their synergy. Good harmonies, excellent guitar work.It's even a jam night so aspiring musicians can go up and jam on stage too!The food is great and their alcohol cheap!This place is good and great!

Hood is a bar that actively promotes the local music scene with acts performing everyday (yes they are open on Sundays too!). The place has funky decor and also a HUGE screen that screens soccer matches. Recommend to give their thin-crusted pizza a try.. Thumbs up!! Drinks are reasonably priced as well, with occasional promotions going on and happy hour from 5-9pm. Do drop by if you're in the area and have a taste of the local music scene
