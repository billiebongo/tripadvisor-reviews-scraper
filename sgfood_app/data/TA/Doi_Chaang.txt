I was rushing for my lunch, it only took around 10mins to serve my set lunch with little salad, soup and vegetable lagsane. Food is delicious and the staff is very helpful with great smiles, service is great and price is fair.

Will come again for a coffee and just chill. Pleasant deco with plants and fighting fish in glass jars. Soft music in background. Cushions indoors, breezy seating space outdoors.

Who needs a thai iced milk tea while you can have a thai iced doi chaang?First i found this small coffee place in Johor Bahru and fell in love with their coffee, and was missing it since until i found this little gems hidden in a business area where i worked. Went there few times a week to fix my crave.Guys you should try it. Beware if the barista is a middle age man. (his coffee skill is not good.) His foams are all foamy and it does not taste good, and espresso were over extraction time
