We had one of the best meals in Singapore here. 2 beautiful fruit smoothies, chicken 3 ways, beansprouts, rice - the works - all for $10. The food as so fresh and tasty. Well worth a visit if you're in the area.
5
went to stall 24 and had the pork two ways with rice. $7 in total and very tasty. Not air conditioned and there are adjacent juice and beer stalls
5
I have been here to have char kway teow and am pleased the standard has not been compromised at this hawker centre. A must try for locals and tourists although a half hour wait is average and being patient is a virtue you have to possess!

I don't come to this food center often. Therefore I randomly selected this stall and ordered a teh o kao from them. The tea is basically tasteless. I went back to feedback to the owner and he just replied nonchalantly - is like that. I think I'm more upset about the stall owner's reaction than the blend tea. If you can't make a good coffee or tea, then just sell canned drinks. Everyone needs to earn a living, but please earn it in a decent way. Shame on you.

We were staying about a km away but made the effort to eat here several times. There were great choices and reasonable prices. It's a good place for couples, families and friends. The table cleaners do a great job and it helps if you take your tray and dishes up to the stations when you leave. The river walk to and from is a pleasant walk, just watch the people staring at their phones as they will walk into you
4
Consistently quality offering at Zion, particularly the award winning carrot cake at stall 26 (yeah, I know, it's radish, we all know ok?), braised duck noodles (stall 24), and the chicken wings - al5hougg you will have to wait 10 or 15 minutes for the wings as they are barbequed fresh. Old mate at May Teck Coffee Stall is an all round champion too.Why do I choose Zion? It's on the river and that's the Zion difference
4
We were the only non-Asians present in the hawker place, but had no trouble ordering the food for my famiy of 5. My young son loved the satay sticks, the rest of us had duck with either noodles or rice. The stall owners were great and offered us advice (eg free wifi for my 18 year old) and were very friendly.Overall a fun and cheap way to eat
4
We were desperate to escape the tourist traps and selected this hawker centre from a list of many. We found it very pleasant, with no aggressive hawkers trying to force their wares on tourists. In fact, there were hardly any Europeans there, only locals. Great prices, mostly $3-4 per dish, and our kids loved the food. The vendors were all polite and helpful. We tried meatball soup, braised duck with vegetables, beef noodles and pan-fried pork dumplings. My kids were thanking me for taking them there, which doesn't often happen.
5
Forget the flashy H&M and the 200 metre tall hotels, to see the real Singapore you go to a hawker centre like Zion. You won't see many tourists here, just the locals who want reliable, cheap and delicious food. Trying to play it reasonably safe, I saw a stand selling dumplings and stew (you know a food stall is good when there're many people hovering around it). They serve it to you on a tray and you collect your chopsticks and serviettes etc, it's like being at a school canteen. The meal was also served with two bowls of ginger and soy sauce. Everything you see in the picture was less than Â£10.After finishing the stew I wasn't convinced, it wasn't a particularly strong flavour but it was a good appetiser to get the taste buds going. The beef dumplings where delicious however, different (and better) to what I've had in the UK. It's moist inside and light to eat, I could've had another serving happily.My only recommendation for a foreigner is to be careful with some of the more exotic foods for sale to avoid an upset stomach. Other than that, Zion food centre is a must
5
Braised duck with noodles and a Tiger Beer - simple, cheap and delicious! When you go to a Hawker Center you find what you want to eat and some stalls have beer as well as food but most you have to get your food and beer separately - prices are about 3-4 Singapore dollars for a meal and 6+ for a .5 liter Tiger beer.
5
We visited a number of food centres during our visit but found this one to be one of the best.
Generally cheaper than the touristy Little India and Chinatown.
Wide variety of cuisines.
4
There are different seating arrangements from 4 to 10 to gather and catch up over dinner or early supper
different items that will keep you satisfied. There a a few popular stalls here which may require some waiting time
5
I have eaten here three or four times and the pan fried dumplings at Ah Wang La Mian are amazing. Not to mention the Xiao Long Bao too. All for under six dollars. Defiantly worth the trip
5
If you are in the area of Zion Road, go to this food center to discover the delicious taste of traditional local dishes.
5
Buzzing atmosphere during the day with variety of local flavors. Tried food from a few stalls and it is fresh , aromatic and delicious . Great to visit during the day
4
We remember this hawker center some 20 years ago. It looked similar but with some refurbishment on our recent visit to Singapore. The venue was small but packed with several local food stalls that have developed a regular following. We were told by patrons the Chye Tow Kuay (radish cake), Hokkien Prawn Mee, Char Kway Teow (stir-fried flat rice noodles), barbecued chicken wings and satay were popular. We could also see queues materialising at specific stalls. Others had perpetual queues.
3
Stopped here today for some juice whilst cycling along the river with my daughter. It's not too busy in the late morning on a Sunday and it's usually possible to get a table. I had a green apple juice whilst she had a watermelon juice. Very good value for a total price of $4
3
We were taken to this Food Centre by our taxi driver as he said the one we wanted was closed at that time of night.On arrival we found ourselves a seat, arranged some drinks and went exploring. Some of the stalls had well presented but had no customers. We generally follow the local crowd although this may have been a bit of our undoing.I tried to place my order with the assistance of a very helpful chap in the queue, even with the translation and pointing to the menu board I am not certain we actually got what we ordered.We tried a variety of foods from a variety of stalls with a mix of good to 'just not suited to our palate'. We were discrete with the food we didn't like as not to offend.We appreciated the experience however it just wasn't for us, it may be suited to others as the range is quite broad
5
If you happen to be in the area, you really need to pay a visit to "Ah Wang La Mian Xiao Long Bao" at Zion Road Hawker center. Dollar for dollar, it serves the most authentic and delicious pork and chive dumplings in Singapore. "Pork and chive dumplings" is a classic Northern Chinese dish, like meat loaf in the US or spaghetti Bolognese in Italy, every grandmother has a secret family recipe. It is a simple dish with only a handful of ingredients, but to get the flavours right, it takes a lot of experience. And the chefs at "Ah Wang" get it just right- The wrapper is thin, the filling is juicy and bursting with flavours. The pan-fried version is cooked to perfection where the dumpling wrapper offers just the right amount of crispiness on one side and chewiness on the other. You get ten of these delicious dumplings for just $5. It is the best money I have spent in weeks..
5
We lived in Singapore for many years. Last Christmas we returned for a holiday. So happy to find that the same Char Kway Teow Stall is still in business at the Zion Road Hawker Centre. Every Singaporean has their favourite place to eat local Hawker food. 10 years later we had a blissful binge on the local delights of Singapore. If you are opting for take away, your noodles will be wrapped in brown paper, sealed with an elastic band. A 4 dollar portion will feed 2 people. It is no surprise to me that Singapore street food has received 2 Michelin stars. Wash it down with a beer or a freshly squeezed lime juice drink. The prawn mee noodle soup is also very good. Chicken or duck rice delicious
4
I've been to many food market & although it was quite nice & had a very open air feel, I thought the selection / variety of food from the vendors was limited compared to many other places I've been in Singapore.
4
Great pig trotter and fish soup.
The famous Char Kway Teow was overrated. The famous duck rice and Kway chap dropped in standard over time.
3
A middle of the road hawker centre used by local workers and not the best around. Very poor compared to Newton Circus and once you order food takes a long time to arrive. Lots of other good places to go instead.
4
I didnt really like the Kuay Teow that much but really like the beef. The sauce was really good. But even if you dont go there for the kuay teow...there a variety of foods to choose from. sugar cane drink wasnt that good there though.
4
The first night in Singapore we stumbled across the Zion Road Food Centre and were amazed to get a meal for two people for $13.50! It is an openair venue and a lot of local people seem to eat here. Recommended for the quality of the food and the cheapness
4
The location for this food centre isn't correctly marked on the map. Look for the Zion riverside good centre in trip advisor to get the correct location. This is a pretty good hawker especially if you are staying in one of the nearby hotels. There is a good variety of food and very good prices. We tried the famous kway teow, roasted duck, chicken wings and sate along with the nice mixed juice stall. They place is non halal except for the sate stall which serves food on styrofoam plates.Wouldn't make a trip to here but would definitely stop by if in the area.
4
I had dinner here once so I haven't sampled everything on offer yet. I was staying at the Holiday Inn Atrium which is just a few minutes walk away.I had braised duck with rice and veg (4 SGD) and a large, cold Tiger beer (6.20 SGD). I will certainly visit again
5
We made a stop here for lunch after our "hop on/hop off bus" recommended it as a great place for hawker food in Singapore and it was definitely the right decision. It is organized as a bunch of small stands selling 1-2 signature dishes and then other stands selling fresh drinks and beers. This is great if you are going with friends or family because you can all get different things or you can get a bunch of things and share. We had these delicious pan-friend wontons that came with a rich soy-based daikon sauce on the side. They were so fresh and you could taste the veggies and herbs that were mixed in with the pork to make the filling. We also hit the really crowded Hainanese chicken rice stand and ordered the set meal (what all the locals were getting) of the roasted chicken. It came with sliced chicken over rice with a thin brown sauce, a plate of steamed bok choy, and chicken soup. It was FANTASTIC and the spicy orange sauce to top it was perfect. Last thing we had was a duck noodle which was really tasty and some of the most tender duck we have ever had across the world. The flavor was meaty and rich and that dish was gone very quickly! All of the prices are super reasonable if not cheap and there are plenty of seats in the open air setting
4
The Zion Rd hawker market was located a short walk from the studio my family was staying in. Being a bit tired one night, I left the family at the studio and ventured to Zion Rd to get some takeaway. Plenty of locals mixed with tourists gave me confidence there was good turnover. BBQ pork with rice, chicken with soy-rice and some char kway teow - all for less than S$20. Cheap and good. What else could you want
5
We are travellers from Europe, so definitely don't measure food courts by the same standards as some of the past reviewers. I generally really enjoy the concept of the hawker centre, although I have been to more than a handful during my stays in Singapore.We enjoyed this food court because it is very open and there is outdoor seating by the river. The satay, BBQ chicken wings and the braised duck are particularly good here. We also enjoyed the fruit juice stalls. If you don't know where to go, it's always a good tip to queue where lots of people are standing :)Prices are very reasonable. This food centre gets very busy around lunchtime, when people from surrounding office buildings flood in to get their lunch.We came here several times during our stay and enjoyed every meal
4
Many recommended food here particularly the BBQ Chechen wings. I could easily eat 10 myself. Only S$1.30 each.
5
Zion Food Center is very close to my hotel. I have stayed on Havelock Rd. many times and always enjoy having a beer and a delicious dish at the Zion.
2
The "anchor" tenant here is the famous fried Kway teow stall where people know this hawker centre from . If the line is too long or when the stall is closed, the spillover effect feeds the other stalls . The 2nd most famous stall is the prawn noodle stall where they use giant prawns and heads for extra flavo
4
A small hawker center located a distance from MRTs and far from places with high passenger traffic, this is not naturally THE place to go. But it has somehow gained popularity for some reason. It offers the standard fare that other hawker centers do, and the price is ok. The food is not bad. The dessert stall is terrible. Overall, it is good, but I've no idea why there's some hype about it.
5
We walked here from Nostalgia Hotel as we wanted to try another food centre for a different selection of dishes. There was a fantastic atmosphere here, with lots to choose from, and we settled in the end for food from #28. I had frogs legs in ginger - I'd never had frogs legs before and I'm always willing to try new things - it was amazing! The lady that runs #28 is awesome, she takes your order written on a sheet of paper and then you sit down. When your food is ready she brings it to you at your table - even if you are sat miles away from the stall she'll remember who you are and will find you. She saw i was getting sticky fingers with my frogs legs (the only way to eat them) and she brought me a packet of wet wipes to use which was amazing service - my partner and I think she must have been a waitress before getting her own stall. Definitely the best stall in any of the food courts
4
Went here with my family. Lots of choice of food stalls to choose from and, despite being novices, quickly learnt how thing work.Very tasty food and prices which were on average S$5 each. Large bottle of beer was also S$5. Total bill for family including drinks was S$50
3
Just a fairly average food court with all the usual stuff you would expect in such a venue. Makes for a good stop if you've been out cycling along the river and need somewhere relatively inexpensive where you can keep an eye on your bike whilst eating
4
A nice place with a lot of choice. Every stand has there own speciality,from satay,noodles,duck,chicken and more.It is on the opposite side of the road of a shopping mall.Most of the people who are enjoying the food there are locals when I went there to eat.Clean and worth you're money
5
A great place to eat with a range of local dishes. Open-aired beside the water, it had a great atmosphere. The prices of the dishes available started at around $4. Even though places stay open late the centre food shops are family run so they need to get home......they start closing by 8pm so make sure you're early
4
We are staying at great work city apartments and this Zion road hawker centre is diagonally opposite, a great find! The best stall is number 18 for the cha kway tweo, we ordered the large for $5, there is a queue but it moves and wright while waiting for. Last night a Wednesday night there was no queue and we ordered it non spicy. The satays are ok, there is chicken pork etc... a bit greasy and not much meat on them, they are .60 cents each, the peanut sauce is great! The green leafy vegies were $2 and good. The hall is large and many tables available. My husband bought some beer quite cheap as well a large bottle was $5. If you want to eat with the locals this is the place! Last night we had it take away, and this is a great option as you can take it to your apt and enjoy it quietly
4
Great little hawker centre - best food came from the stalls with longest queues, so easy to work out where to go. "The Kway man" was the best from which we had braised duck with noodles. Satay stall was also good - great peanut sauce.
3
If you want to try the local food of Singapore, you should try this place. The price is cheap enough.
3
This review is written or gweilo, as no local or Asian would consult Tripadvisor for a hawker centre! This one is pretty authentic, as Newton Circus is primarily for tourists. Mr. Há»“ Kian Tat's 18 Fried Kway Teow stall is the most famous (he's been invited by the President to the Istana!), but the selection is quite wide - chap kway (yummy), braised duck, carrot cake, prawn mee, satay, etc. And for those who can't stomach intestines or are just not adventurous, there's even a stall that serves schnitzel and fried chicken. These stalls can only maintain such low prices thanks to the government's help with the rent
4
Yes the noodle Kway tweo is lovely but you have to wait for it. In the meantime send your partner to the satay lineup and order chicken and mutton combo which comes with an excellent peanut sauce . Must try the "carrot cake" which is really some sort of a radish omelette with peppers. The owners are a deaf mutes couple and you just point to your order and she also lip reads. Love the white carrot cake. The black and white is very popular but I found the black a bit sweet. Skip the steamboat.
4
Was in Singapore for a visit and went with a couple of friends. The char kway teow was really yummy - a queue was developing before we got there. The portions are generous esp the amount of cockles - every mouthful was sensational!! Also got the oyster omelette which wasn't bad and ordered the mixed carrot cake - part black/ part white. I preferred the white carrot cake but my friend and husband liked the black one. We also got pork and chicken satay which I found quite average though my friend was raving about the peanut sauce. I did like the otah - also from the satay stall. Saw the queue developing in front of the prawn mee stall before it was even open!! We didn't try that as already had loads of food, some of which we were not able to finish. We visited on a Friday evening which was surprisingly quiet, so we didn't have to queue too long for the yummy fare. Had yummy sugarcane juice and my friends also indulged in desserts at the end of the feast!! Would definitely make a return visit the next time I am in Singapore!
5
I had the Braised Duck and charred pork rice, it was so tasty and savoury, and for such a small price (4 sgd)! Also no que and lots of free seats, I was here at 13.30, so its possibly more crowded at other times. Highly recommended! :
4
I came across this hawker centre as my yoga centre is just nearby river valley area. I must say that almost all of their food offerings are yummy. If you are a first time visitor, do queue at the longest queue at that point of time and you won't go wrong with it. Note worthy foods are the 'Cha Kuay Teow' with lots of ingredients and daily long queues, the 'Prawn Noodles' with succulent big prawns with long queue as well, chicken rice stalls and the 'Kuay Chap' stall with pork organs and duck meat. Only very few traditional Kuay Chap stalls incorporate duck meat in this dish so do give it a try if you are up for it! Love visiting this place whenever I'm around the vincinity
4
It is obvious that this hawker centre is popular amongst locals. Not a lot of choice and small compared to the others. But it has all the food one would want. The Chow kway teow was amazing. Satays were good. Across the street from a big shopping mall so parking is not a problem. Highly recommend if you want to see where the locals eat
4
Hawker centers are such a pervasive part of Singapore culture and with stalls found almost at any corner of the city state, one has to stand out. Stall No.18 Char Kway Teow is one of those that prides itself with its many cut-out positive newspaper reviews pasted at the stall front. Perhaps the one thing that amuses me most is the signboard above the stall that reads "Hallelujah! Charismatic cooking."The char kway teow here is famous and popular, as evidenced by the line during peak hours. The small bites of crispy pork load are a nice sinful treat. The fish cakes are lovely. There is also a generous amount of cockles- almost every spoonful of noodle into my mouth has a piece of cockle in it, which is my fav. The fried noodles is moist and flavorful with a good depth.Another stall to try is Double Happy Bak Kut Teh that serves Teochew style BKT which means that the soup is darker in color compared to the clear soup that is typical of Singapore-style BKT. Because of the darker color, the soup is tastier with the added herbs but not as intense as the Malaysian-style BKT. An order for 2 people comes in a claypot. The pork ribs were tender and lean, but still enough with some occasional fat to help render the pork during the cooking process to make the meat tender. Definitely enjoyed it very much
4
This hawker food center is not as big as the othe singaporean hawker center. Located at the left size of Zion road, across the Great World City mall. Easy to find just a little walk crossing the road from the mall. Tried a char kway tiau that is very famous there. Kiosk located on the first shop on the right at the hawker entrance. Tasted yummy!!! It has every pcs of seafood bits to it. Worth it for 3/4/5SGD u can pick your own size. There Are quite a few table available. Places are quite clean. I noticed there are 2more kiosks (prawn noodle and roast duck) that has long queu. Might worh to try. They also separate the halal and non halal food. Quite clear signage. I strolled around the hawker, foor range sgd$3-15. All types of food are typically same as other hawkers. Just might taste different. For visitors i would recommend this hawker if you are around the area. Not sure the closest MRT station. I think it was outram park but took > 20min walk. Might have to take buses or taxi to get here.
5
No 18 Zion road Char Kuay Teow is one of the legendary hawker stall for this popular local food. Mention Char kuay teow and everybody will think of this place immediately.
5
Went with friends from Taiwan and everybody enjoyed the Char Kuay Teow, Kway Chap. Did not have enough tummy space for the prawn noodles.
4
Loving this place. Great authentic local food. Cheap beer and facilities are well kept. This place is always busy and have some great satay, seafood soup and even tried the pigs organ soup which turned out to be much better than it sounded.
4
This was one of my husband's 'must do' things for our trip to Singapore. We stayed at Holiday Inn Atrium, so Zion was only a short 5-10 min walk away. We visited here twice, for lunch and then tea. Their opening hours are about 10am to 10pm, give or take! The open air complex was kept clean and lots of overhead fans made it a pleasant place to be. We tried various dishes; some great, some good, some not so good! Stall 23 sold ice cold Tiger beer, stall 6 had great satay, the pork from stall 25 was good but the rice so so, the traditional ckn & rice dish from stall 17 and the cane & lemon juice next door were ok, Mick tried the Char Kuay Teow from stall 18 which he did not like! But there were plenty of others that do, as they were doing a roaring trade both times we were there. We could have gone back again and again to try more as there are so many choices. We recommend others to go and enjoy
5
Zion, in my opinion was a more authentic local food centre, as opposed to some of the bigger and more impressive ones.All in all great experience, obviously i didn't try EVERYTHING there but from what i did try the black and white carrot cake was really yummy! I got it from a stall there that is owned and operated by a deaf guy!This place, like many of the food centres in Singapore are very clean and not as hot as you think that they might be, considering there is no AC
4
Zion Road is well worth a visit. Great freshly squeezed juices are available alongside super cheap hawker food and what is apparently the best Char Kuay Teow around. The dish has made the Top 10 list for must eat but it might kil you foods! High in fat it is traditionally cooked in lashings of duck fat, which is of course what makes it so scrumptious. The long line of locals was a pretty good indication that it deserved this reputation
4
Staying at Great Worlds City and although that has a v clean "Hawker type" Centre, the Zion road is by far better tasting and you can assume locals think so too. Many of them park up and nip in for a take out. will miss this place when we move out of town next week. I will deffo be back though. Carrot Pancakes, Chicken Rice and the Satay are my favourites, washed down by a large Tiger at only S$5.40
4
Visited Singapore every year for the last 22 years, stayed in Great World City for the last 12, eaten at Zion Road Food Court for 12 years, too. Always a pleasure........BUT my favourite stall has shut down!! A real shame. Can I still get great food? Of course ........ but I miss the friendly smile and chat with the owner and his wife. I only hope they have entered a well earned retirement.Nevertheless, I shall get over it....... Helped by Char Kuay Teow, chicken rice and sugar cane juice with lemon!
4
This hawker centre is a great place to experience authentic local food with lots of atmosphere. Its very near to hotels such as Holiday Inn Atrium. Lots of options for vegetarians - the carrot cake was great (a savoury dish with no carrots), the freshly juiced sugar cane drink with lemon was a real thirst quencher, the soya beancurd milk jelly was stunning
4
At this relatively small open air food court, you'll find what is Singapore's best chai tau kuey or carrot cake stall. Run by a super nice deaf couple, you'll have to act out your order with a bit of sign language, but that just adds to the fun of coming here. It's simply the best in town and I'd be happy to put a wager on that
4
Char Kway Teow there is a must try but if you're pressed for time, most of the other stalls are not too bad either.
4
Variety it key...from Char Keow Tiao to prawn noodle...thumbs up (watch for the looong queues though)
5
This is where you would want to sample REAL Singapore food! If you are staying in the hotels along the river, or the holiday inn, don't miss this place. It's within walking distance of your hotels. Give the 'food junction' food court in Great World City across the road a miss and walk here instead.Must Tries:1. Char Kway Teow (no.18) if it's only one dish you eat here, it has to be this one!2. Freshly squeezed sugar cane juice (with lemon if you want more zing)3. Hainanese Chicken Rice4. Duck Rice5. Bak Kut teh (pork rib soup)6. Pig Innards Soup (It's not disgusting as it sounds, it has a nice peppery pleasant taste!)7. Prawn noodles soup8. Fishball noodlesAnd if you still have room for dessert, try the array from the dessert stalls or the bean curd dessert.Only then can you say that you have tried Singapore Hawker food!
4
I used to eat here years ago and took a friend in January to experience real Singapore food. Sadly my favourite dish of Fried KweyTeow was not up to its usual standard but still ok. In my opinion this used to be the best but something has changed. However not to be disappointed we also had the Hainanese Chicken Rice from a few stalls down which would have to be the best I have ever had, infact we ordered 3 more dishes of it as the portion is quite small (we even took takeaway). The chicken was melt in your mouth tender and succulent and we just kept going back for more. Beer was cheap and cold. The dinng area is kept clean and the staff are very friendly. Not all stalls are open everyday but there is good choice if your favourite is closed. Great location if you are staying at Furama, Holiday Inn or Copthorn, opposite Great World City on the Zion Road side
4
The food selection here is great - you can get most of the great dishes here. We sampled some duck/noodle dishes which were only $4SGD each, along with a fresh sugar cane juice. It was fantastic. A much better choice than eating in the shopping centres - real, authentic and tasty
5
If you're after something different from the Great World City eating experience (found across the road) then the Zion Food Centre my be just what you're looking for.The Zion Road Food Centre was refurbished mid 2012 and is today, comfortable, hygienic and offers excellent authentic Singapore cuisine. As one of the smaller Food Centres it's probably closer to the original "hawker markets" (but with mod cons - make sure that you have a 20c coin if you might need the toilet) of Singapore, now sadly disappearing fast.For an outlay of below 10 Sing Dollars you can eat like a king. Try Singapore's famous Chicken Rice or some fresh seafood noodle dishes. The stall owners are friendly and willing to help out a foreign visitor.Try the fresh squeezed juice for a treat (my favourite is watermelon) or go for an ice cold beer costing considerably less than other more "Western" outlets.Share a table with some of the locals and explore your inner foodie, get out of your comfort zone and try something new for lunch or dinner. You're not going to eat in air conditioned comfort but the easy to understand alphabetic hygiene labels at each stall (stick with A or B if you want to be conservative, but be aware that this labeling is taken very seriously by the Singapore authorities, so you should be fine, even with a C rating) will give you peace of mind
4
This covered hawker stand is within walking distance of the Furama Riverview and the Holiday Inn. Recently updated. I joined the long queue for the fried kway teow and was well worth the wait. I ordered the $4 plate (medium) and couldn't finish it. Lots of noodles, bits of meats and seafood, veggies. Totally delicious! My lemon iced tea was $2 from another stand. And delicious mango pudding $2 from yet another stand. This is a self service stand
5
One of the few hawker centres that is less visited by tourists and smallish compared to many others. Prices are still very cheap but you have to live without the air-conditioning comfort. Highly recommended for a representative range of Singapore hawker food. The ones that I particularly like - Chay kway teow (although the line is long at times, it moves very quickly), soy bean dessert called dofu fah (healthier version than the usual places as it does not add the calcium sulfate/ gypsum solidifier as explained to me by the store owner, my latest find in Singapore), fried carrot cake (operated by partially dead/ mute man), soy sauce braised duck and kway chap (Teochew dish made with small flat rice noodle sheets usually served with braised hard-boiled egg, beancurd and pig intestines covered with a slightly sweet gravy-like sauce). Look out for newspapers/ magazine clippings of reviews hung in front of the stalls and look for the ones with lines as well
5
Currently living across the road and the food is good and it's reminiscent of old Singapore and Malaysian Hawker Centres. Lots of noise and quick food tuenover which ensures freshness. You can also get a cold beer there. Don't forgret 20 cents for the toilet turnstiles
5
Food in the basement of Great World City is OK...... but cross Zion Road and turn left and in 2 mins you can have something much better (and cheaper). On entering you immediately have (probably) the finest Char Kway Chow in Singapore. Turn left straight away and you have (on the left) my favourite Chicken Rice stall. The others are OK if this guy is closed........ but I think this one is best. Also enjoy freshly squeezed sugar cane juice with lemon.this is authentic Singapore food at its best
4
Good Local eats for Hokkien Mee, and fish soup. Soybean Dessert place is yum
4
Great for fried kuay-teow & fried carrot cake
4
Must have the char kuey teow ..
4
Should try the chinese dumplings (shui jiao) and the hot and sour soup!!!
3
Love that hawker food :-)
4
Not bad. Should make a trip there.
3
Ironically I thought the most popular chay kway teow stall (lotsa awards; closest to Zion Rd) was the worst
4
Fried Taupok, Carrot cakes and Chay Kway Teow
3
good char kwey teow
2
Just like any other food center, nothing really special there now. The famous cha koay tiaw is so so.
4
Lao Wu Fried Carrot Cake - BEST !
4
