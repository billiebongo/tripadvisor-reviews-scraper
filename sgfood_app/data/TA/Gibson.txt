We really enjoyed the cocktails there on numerous evenings. The place is fun and professional. I also liked that we received refreshing tea and water on the house. Talk about staying hydrated while having alcohol.

From the people who gave us the delightful J&P and Sugarhall at Telok Ayr, this is one of a three-part drink and dine concept which consists of whisky, oysters, and cocktails.
As legally close to SGH as can get - you're covered for the night.

Had a few drinks here before dinner at Humpback. Love the cocktails and though I didn't have any - the oysters my husband sucked down seemed to hit the spot very nicely!

Happy hour cocktails and 5 types of oysters are very good. Had gentleman's mule and 15 oysters. Wait staff is very attentive and kept on refilling cocktail nuts. Good ambience and happy Friday chill place :)

Hiding on the upstairs of a beautiful conservation house is a little intimate watering hole call Gibson. Not like other establishments in the area which might seem intimidating, Gibson is like an easy drink you can order over and over again and still hold your conversation

Love this little bar. Some of the best service I've had in Singapore. I don't drink alcohol, so asked for a mocktail. The waitress asked what kind of flavours and tastes I preferred and then the barman customised different mocktails for me. Other cocktails that I saw served were beautifully presented, and some had a theatrical flair. Didn't try the food, but was addicted to the bar snacks

The food downstairs was amazing!!! The Cod from New Zealand is a must try. After dinner we then headed up stairs for cocktails. The cocktails are so unique & the bartenders Rhyse & Roger are just awesome to watch making the cocktails. They truly make the experience even better. So make sure you sit up at the bar and watch them work their magic. In the photos is Rhyse :).

Best ever service I've had at a bar. The service staff was attentive and friendly and constantly topped up our bar snacks and water. Bar snacks were great too. Drinks were good and oysters were amazing, albeit a bit pricy at $7. Would recommend going during happy hour for the oysters. Overall one of the best bars I've ever been to. Would definitely go back. Music was pleasant too. Bar wasn't overly packed either. A little on the noisy side
