Had dinner here twice in two weeks. Service was always quick and friendly, and food was serverd very quickly. Pizzas are excellent, and pasta dishes were good too.
4
Situated inside Orchard Gateway shopping mall. Small but great food. Staff attentive and friendly. Happy hour Saturday 6pm to 7pm two drinks for the price of one!
3
Was shopping around in 313 Orchard shopping complex and bumped into this busy italian restaurant for a quick lunch. Service was average. Ordered the Spaghetti Aglio. Tasted original italian. Nice alfresco dining.
4
So Crowded, Good Food, and So-so Service because they are so Crowded.
an Ok Place for chit chat with friends
5
Just had a break at Trattoria. They had one for one pint beer promo from 12-7pm daily. We had the truffles fries - yummy! We had the ferrero ice cream and strawberry sorbet on waffle cone - very good! Unlike the comments in the review below, we received great service from the manager and staffs. Well done and keep it up. We will back for the Lobster Pasta and Nutella Pizza...
1
This is our second visit and we felt unwelcomed. The manager and the rest of the team didnt even come to our table to check the quality of our food, On our right single diner asian lady, on our left are two gentlemen white skin all of them went on their table to check if evrything was ok... and nobody ask us if everything ok and each of them went on them to check the manager, the waitress, the asian guy maybe supervisor, and waiter. We are not satisfied with the food also. We will never come back.
5
If you can bear with he hussle and noise of Somerset 313 - Trattoria offsets with excellent good, hit, served and dressed well. We ordered Penne Arrabiata and it was served with medium spice and well cut red chillies. My Friend ordered seafood option and it came with shrimp and Clam !! Plenty of drink options too including Peroni beer !!! Price is moderate and crew is decent. Bon Appetite!
4
There can be a bit of a wait at time. It is not that the restaurant is crowded. Staff are not as attentive. Food is good, we tried both a pizza as well as a pasta. Both were excellent. Stay away from the gelato.Because it is inside a mall, it can get noisy at times. Not the best ambience. A will do kind off restaurant
5
Whilst shopping in Singapore 's Orchard Road , we came across Trattoria.We managed to get two seats without booking , were attended to immediately and supplied with two Ivey cold drinks to quench our thirst after walking around in the humidity.The restaurant 's menu was large and varied for both food and drinks, we soon decided on dinner and within a short time , both had our beautifully presented meals on our table.Food and drinks were better than expected , staff service was impeccable, costs of meals and drinks were very reasonable.We have now attended twice , both for dinner and lunch and could not speak more highly of the service , food and drinks
5
We decided to eat here for dinner while venturing down Orchard Road and were so glad we did! We both enjoyed two different pasta dishes, a glass of wine and two beer. The prices were reasonable and the food tasted amazing! The staff were also very accommodating on helping us choose what to eat and drink.
5
We stayed in Singapore for 5 days and ate here twice.
All of us enjoyed the food a lot. The vegetarian and Jain options were very good. Special recommendation for the mushroom ravioli and truffle fettuccine.
4
I like it. I ate pizza and it was fresh, nicely presented and great produce. the restaurant was well lit and busy and the service was good. Plenty of choose from and it was a nice meal.
4
The chef in the kitchen and one guy outside are looking Italian even talking with Italian accent. The bowl of minestrone was nice and quite a lot. Pizza is nice, thin and tasty. Real Italian.
5
This is a joint which have lot of pizza, pasta and main course options. Most of the dishes are either pork or vegetarian. They have seafood dishes also. Try out Tagliatelle seafood al cartoccio pasta.....good seafood pasta....serve good cocktails also. Try out the joint
3
Had pan fried salmon with salad, good, crispy fish skin, moist flesh, tasty; boiled and fried vegetables in olive oil, good. Venue was very noisy , outside the Somerset MRT
1
Staff were rude and inattentive. Food was average. Would definitely never go there again. Has a good location, probably the only reason why it's still afloat.
3
Offers various italian menu in an open space inside 313@sommerset orchard rd., this restaurant is perfect place to spent your saturday night. Its a minute hop from sommerset mrt station. It also located near orchard getway.The banana split is a must try menu there. Three BIG scoop ice cream is mouthwatering. You should try it
2
When I saw my Calzone pizza, expectations were high. Unfortunately it was poor on stuffing and I was disappointed. I think not even half was filled and the part that was, was poorly stuffed. The waiter was not as friendly as other places in Singapore. Too bad, definately because it was not cheap..
5
Stopped by here whilst shopping on Orchard Road and fancied Italian for lunch. Quite an extensive menu so plenty to choose from, and very reasonably priced. Wait staff were lovely, ordered a pizza each and waited for our lunch. Tables, cutlery etc, spotlessly clean. Drinks came promptly, the young man who waited on us was very friendly and helpful. The pizza was delicious and authentic Italian style pizza, easily as good as we have eaten in Italy. Such a shame we discovered this little gem hidden in a shopping centre at the end of our stay in Singapore, would have loved to have eaten there several more times
4
We stayed at Jen Orchard Gateway Hotel and just walked down looking around for a nice English breakfast. Walked passed and saw the set breakfast menu and decided to sit down as that was what I was looking for. Well worth the S$. The service was good. Well recommended and price is very very reasonable. The illy coffee was well brewed. Go for it. I have been told that the Italian food is very good too but I will certainly return to try.
4
After three weeks of Asian food we were in need of something different. The food was served quickly, good portions and very fresh. Had a great meal!
5
Incredible thin crust Pizza!! This place is legit! Run by Italians that know what they are doing. Could be the best pizza in Asia.
4
Called in here for a late lunch and ordered the Bruschetta alla Siciliana which is basically melted cheese and an anchovy on top of lightly toasted bread. I had six pieces and it was totally delicious!
Friendly manager and swift service, 18.70.
2
Ordered a 4 cheese pizza through food panda. Delivery was ahead of time, but was disappointed with the pizza. There were hardly any cheese and I could only taste the thin crust.
3
This was a quick lunch on the go we were shopping up a storm! This restaurant is nice an handy to the MRT station and well worth catching a later train for. We ordered a Parma pizza and it was delicious, perfectly presented and just as an Italian pizza should be. The down side, the house Sauvignon Blanc was $18 a glass. The opportunity, stock local beers
4
Had a meal here rather than eat in the hotel we stayed atBoth had the Lasagna which was decent size portion and tasty (22 sinagapore dollar each + 10% service charge and + 7% Government tax) At the time of eating it was happy hour 5 -7pm, so the drink wasn't bad. Pint Peroni 16 SD AND generous glass of decent house wine same at 16 SD + buy one get one free. So about 93 SD or Â£60 for two mains and 2 drinks each. If you like a drink and don't want to eat early just ask the server to put drinks on the tab before 7pm and they remain in happy hour even if its way past 7pmService very good and friendly, would recommend eating here if you fancy an Italia
4
Had a couple of beers, cold and ok. Lime juice that we hoped to be fresh and without sugar was something bottled, but that was informed before we ordered so not a big deal. Pizza was tasty and service fast. Just have a problem with having a meal in places with a noisy background (an open area in a mall in this case). Looked like I was about the only one with that problem. Recommendable place anyway
2
You could call it Italian but it's definitely not authentic. We ordered bruschetta, vegetarian pizza, maghrerita. The bruschetta was soft and mushy, vegetarian pizza was average which just was thin crust but these days even fast food pizza companies have options. Not really exceptional, very noisy location. Margherita was non frozen really badly made. Service was ok and everyone seemed rushed. Not a great experience and definitely not at all value for money.
3
If you are looking for a quick bite of Italian Pizza in a sit down restaurant on busy Orchard Road on a Sunday evening, Trattoria at 313 Somerset should do the job. It's a bustling place right on 313 Somerset with few comfortable tables on offer. The waiter who showed us in last Sunday evening promised to seat us on one, after we had perused the menu card & ordered our drink and food. He kept his word and we were happy to move from otherwise bare chairs we had to start with! We settled for a quick bite of Vegeteriana 12 inch Pizza with some potato wedges as Starters. The thin crusted pizza seemed authentic enough and the evening passed quite well in otherwise busy 313 Somerset Mall. The price though appeared a bit steep but we had to remember we were in a Singapore expat frequented mall! No doubt Singapore got voted the most expensive location for an expat worldwide
2
We had lunch today here. The cook, for that is all he can be, has not read the same recipe for minestrone soup as I have. No meat or meat flavour in the stock, vegetables, well most were at best al dente, and on the rawer side of that!Had to ask for some bread, got two slices.The only minestrone soup I have never finished in my life, and it was a small serving indeed.And overpriced
1
This place is so crowded so I thought it can't be that bad. I ordered my favorite four cheese pizza. Sadly, I can barely taste any blue cheese in it. It's the worst pizza I ever had.
The pasta was average.
4
Ordered cheese pizza and seafood pizza. The pizzas were crispy with its thin crust. The cheese pizza was fragrant and has strong cheese smell. The seafood in the seafood pizza was fresh.
5
I didn't expect much, but I was pleasently surprised. I'm a big fan of Italian food, and I eat it wherever I travel. I must say it's one of the better places I visited. I had spaghetti carbonara and milestrone soup.
4
They have one for one on beers and wine before 7pm making this one of the most affordable places for a drink in the area. Nice place to sit, have a drink and watch the people.
3
Only had the pizza. It was nothing special. Restaurant is in the middle of a shopping mall so it does not have any character. Average wine. Small list. Good prices. Good place for a quick bite.
5
We were looking for somewhere to stop for lunch and normally would bypass Italian food but I'm glad we stopped and asked Trattoria Italian Kitchen in Somerset food area has Gluten Free pasta, I had the Arabiata sauce and it was devine. The staff are very friendly and helpful too! I highly recommend a visit
3
The restaurant was quite pleasant as was the service and food was good. Wednesday turned out to be a good day to visit as free sparkling wine was served to women. I would recommend this place especially compared to mexican style place next door which was horrendous
4
Sometimes there is a must do errand on Orchard Road on the weekend, even if you quail at the thought of battling tourists, shoppers and Pokemon hunters. This was a relaxing stop, not too crowded at lunch time. Service was pleasant and food was served quickly. We had a hankering for thin crust Margarita pizzas, which were good. Pasta was passable, portion size adequate. Prices range between S$15-25+ taxes.
4
If u get a sudden craving to have italian, this is the place to be... right in the middle of everything... loved the food but seems a bit pricey given that its not a fine dining ambience. If u want to go for an early dinner, not many options for starters or sides. Limited options for chicken lovers. Drinks were superb. Recommend
4
I visited this place for my Birthday dinner. The food is pretty satisfying, esp the Mushroom Ravioli that we ordered. They have a good variety of wines and other drinks, and a good range of options for vegetarians to choose from as well. I didn't quite enjoy the Potato dumplings in Pesto Sauce, I wanted to try something new. I would definitely go back, to try out more of the delicious pastas, and a pizza this time for sure.I wish this place was bigger to accommodate more people and have more space between tables, as it's a pretty good place, located centrally (Right in front of Somerset exit)
2
There are some fantastic Italian restaurants nearby to here for similar prices... Don't just opt for convenience when you could go across to the road to someone like Wine Connection (Bistro) at Cuppage Terrace.
4
I had not anticipated having a large pizza in Singapore. Yet I did and it was nice. Good location and a pleasant busy vibe.
4
Enjoyed my evening at this place with a glass of wine and good authentic Italian food .
Though food was on a expensive side but tastes good.
4
4 of us ate here more than once over a week - mostly dinner, also lunch. Excellent service. Tasty thin crust napoletana, margarita, salami pizzas, crisply battered calamari no grease, well flavoured illy espresso & expertly microfoamed milk, superbly chilled Peroni, nice Australian shiraz by the glass. Interesting place to sit calmly and watch the crowds stream by. Note that we also enjoyed many local singaporean nasi, noodle, and prata meals at several different locations
4
Good , though pricey food , amongst the hustle _ bustle of crowds all around. It's a sort of niche carved out in a crowded location. It's a mix between a quick service restaurant & a coffee shop , though serving Italian food. If you are tired, have time to kill , want good food & are happy to see life around you, this is a good place, though more on the expensive side
3
Food: Delicious Food although price is a bit steep. We enjoyed our Spaghetti Carbonara ($21.90), Filetto di Salmone ($28.90) and authentic Mixed Mushroom Soup ($12). Scoop of Gelato ($6) was good too. Service:Prompt and curt, not friendly and warm.Location:If you like to people-watch, the location would likely be great as there is an endless stream of people strolling past (lots and lots of them!). But if you want somewhere to have a quiet meal, then best avoid
3
I went into the restaurant with my 4 year old in a stroller and a 7 year old next to me, so it was very OBVIOUS that there were kids in my party. The server only gave my sister and me the regular menus, so we ordered food for the kids from that menu, not knowing that there was kids menu, until the food came out and I saw people at the table beside me holding the kids menus. The four cheese pizza was actually good. As for the carbonara, my daughter wasn't very fond of it, so she only ate a little. The thing is the server should have given me the kids menu from the get go, so I didn't have to pay more than double for a bigger portion of food that the kids could not finish anyway. Plus, they did not give my kids the coloring sheets that they gave to the kids at the next table. I had to ask the server for them after my little one saw it at the next table
2
Have eaten at the same restaurants in KL & Bali, which were both good experiences. However in Singapore the meals were overpriced for what you received. No flavour. The only reason we ate was that we were so hungry. Drinks very overpriced $14 for a glass of house wine & there didn't seem to be a standard size glass or pour. The staff probably know a lot of the clientele are tourists, so know they will not see you again
1
I bought a double scoop in a cup of vanilla and strawberry, The server told me that the ice-cream WAS PREMIUM quality. The vanilla scoop had almost no vanilla seeds in it, if I had counted maybe I would have found 3. Neither did it have a natural vanilla taste. The strawberry scoop's color looked artificial.The taste was also artificial like the vanilla. They both tasted like they were flavoured with a cheap flavouring, which I suspect was the case. So premium price : $10 but what you get is a huge disappointment. Not value for money. Does not even taste good. I was getting a take-away scoop, and waiting to get my change was long, the server grudgingly handed me my change
4
...but one feels a little bit on a serving plate sitting here.Pizza was good for a lunch pizza, but woukdn't consider for dinner.Service troups (how many waiters / waitresses a place like this need to manage the 15+ tables?) are attentive .ILLY coffee wins at the end
3
Ate on business with colleagues. Nothing outstanding though the portion sizes where pretty good. I went for the four cheese pizza. Was OK. As with most 'exotic' foods it was quite expensive. I would much rather go for local
4
I find this place to be ideal, in that its traditional Italian whether a pasta or a pizza. the veal is also super
5
So delicious, recommended to try pizza and Italian Beers. It's very nice. It's on Orchard Road, very good location.
3
Good for what I want
The thick pizza and the diet Coca Cola no ice
Good food and service along with nice staff
Finally every thing is Ok
5
If you want pasta.
Really Nice pasta, price a bit morte than in France.
Good pizza, and homemade pasta.
1
Undercooked meal served with non flavourful sauces. Expensive but not worth a penny. Will never come here again. Disappointed!!
3
Needed a break from shopping so chose this restaurant for convenience. Good place to take a break and watch the world go by, the food was good - nothing special - service was good but again nothing special. Singapore seems to be an expensive place to eat and drink! We had Eggs Benedict and a tuna salad, a beer and a water and it was S$68 (Â£35)
1
Walking past this restaurant the other afternoon after a hard day of sightseeing, love Italian Peroni beer, noticed they had Peroni on tap, great!Struck up conversation with an Italian guy who was obviously the owner/manager. He was very helpful in providing advice on some sightseeing attractions - off the beaten path.Like Italian food and decided that an Italian guy in Singapore with Italian restaurant, it must be good - wrong!Returned this evening, Italian guy not there. Wife and i decided upon the chicken breast parmagina with salad and wedges.We received a deep fried chicken schnitzel, with a smattering of a tomato sauce and cheese on top, two lettuce leaves (salad) and some wedges.Just NOT Italian cooking.Customer beware - just don't go there
4
I had take out but was really impress with the service. Once we sat while waiting for our food and my husband opened his phone, someone (I think he was the supervisor, as he greet us, helping us select the menu and also proceed our payment) gave him the wifi password without being asked. Pizza is also good (Spicy Chicken Pizza)
4
Very good pizza (have had the margarita and the four cheese) - thin crust, not overloaded with toppings - very well done. The service was ok, but plenty of room for improvement. The waiting staff was ok, but the manager on duty could really do with some social skills. Overall I'd go back for the food, and make do with the service. Note that they do take-out - maybe the way to do it! ;)[Note this restaurant is inside the 313 mall, just outside the subway exit]
5
We ordered the set lunch. The service was fast and efficient. The food here is always good but this time it was better than expected. Very good. Keep it up.
4
nice Italian food in the heart of singapore
try to pair with a glass of white wine
lovely service free wifi
great location
3
We had a pizza here and though it tasted good, it was rather expensive.
The service seemed to be a bit inexperienced and I could see several times that they seemed to have problem finding out who had ordered what.
3
The food here is average at best!My pasta was undercooked and my partner's pizza was greasy and the chicken on it was a but chunky.We asked for a bruschetta and fries to arrive with the mains but they were served before despite our request. No apology or offer to take them away and provide fresh ones when mains were ready.Mains also came at different times.Shocking that you have to pay an additional $2 for a can of Diet Coke compared to standard Coke.Bad service, average food. Would not recommend
2
Finally get to try out this restaurant for its food & noisy/ busy ambience with the folks on a Saturday evening. Was greeted by a waiter with a Italian accent, not much smile from him. Service wasn't fantastic, average in fact. Didn't offer to send us plain water until I requested.I could understand that it was a weekend evening and business was brisk. Saw and heard him asking the next table if they would like to order coffee as their table was empty from the food they had finished earlier. While having our meal, the waiters kept looking our table to see if we had finished eating and didn't offer to top up our drinking glasses, as there was a family of 6 waiting for a table. This constant movement/ actions of the restaurant staff made us felt uneasy & uncomfortable, alike to many pairs of spy-ing eyes. Fyi, there was an empty for 4 next to mine. Plus point, we were not even 30minutes into our meals. When my table finished our last drop of food, he quickly came over to ask us if we like to order coffee and his staff already started to clear our table even before my mother finished her food. Of course, for such lousy attitude, coffee was not necessary, let alone desserts. While waiting for the bill to come, he sat the family of 6 next to us. I had to squeeze my way out after our bill was settled. So we left with the intention... never to return... No point to pay for lousy service, not a single smile from the servers. Except after the bill was paid

Trattoria in Italy means an informal restaurant with simple Italian dishes.This trattoria fits the bill. My husband is Italian and we used to live in Italy before. We think the dishes are very good for a trattoria. It could be a bit pricey because of the location but I think most western restaurants are very expensive and this one is affordable. This trattoria locates on the open space on the ground level of a very busy big shopping mall and facing the entrance of a underground station (MRT). It can be a bit breezy and cold if you sit at the tables near or facing the underground because of the wind. It is not for a romantic dinner but a quick meal of simple good Italian food.We went there twice and we liked it. We will go back again
3
My experience this time was very sad. The service was pathetic and the chicken that my Friend ordered was undercooked. Also, the Italian bread basket that I ordered contained just one type of common bread. I was appalled at the ridiculous service we got. It took them an hour to offer water. Don't recommend the place at all
3
Had heard good things about this restaurant, and was a little disappointed by the food really being nothing special. I believe they were just launching a new menu, so maybe there are some aspects still to be sorted. Location is in the heart of a mall, close to an MRT exit so atmosphere can be a little nois
5
What an amazing restaurant! Although it sits at the center of a busy mall, the food and music make you feel as if you were somewhere totally different. It has a unique vibe and atmosphere accompanied by great friendly service. The food is delicious, i got the vegetarian pizza with a side of fries. Big portion enough for two for a good price considering it is somewhat in the upper range of restaurant chains. Also apparently there is ladies night every Wednesday (free drinks)
1
My advise is for you to eat elsewhere. I've been here for 3 times and every single one was bad. Very poor customer service, the Italian Manager AND the waitress are RUDE, especially today, I waited 30 minutes for my food and when I ask for water refill, she immediately shunned me saying the pizza is coming and walk by. Hello?? I didn't even told you yet what I am about to ask!The Italian Manger think that it is okay for you to wait, and kept talking to other people at the other table while resting his buttock on our table. Dude! table manner pleaseThe food? Don't bother! Go eat elsewhere
4
The hotel I stayed in does not offer edible food so in search of an alternate I found Trattoria. An Erdinger beer accompanied by a pasta dish was not cheap but very good and in any event far better than my hotel could offer.
2
I would not recommend this restraint. The Waitress stood by the table and watched us eat for the majority of the meal. The food was average I guess.
1
With so many restaurants in the vicinity of orchards. Please avoid this placeThis Italian looking restaurant serves terrible pasta and simply try to charge u a premium as if it is serving authentic Italian food.It is ridiculous and I suggest going else where at all cost unless everywhere else is just too long to queue which was the case for us. Sadly
3
This restaurant is located centrally in Somerset 313 Shopping Mall level 1. Visted here with family. Found the food to be pretty average, nothing as genuine Italian as I have experienced in other Italian restaurants in Singapore. The only good thing was their pizza, which was thin bread and quite crisp. Nothing else worth mentioning
5
Went there few days back. Had a glass of red wine and taglitalle salmon and finish up with tiramisu. The waitress who took care of my table was really helpful and being professional by the way she explains the menu when i asked her what type of pasta i would like to have. Despite it was busy,the waitress took care not only me but almost all the customers. She asked all the table if everything was ok and how is the food. She make a very good explanation when i decided to take desserts. Observing the way she work , its the best service that i had ever experience. She is tall, pretty lady with highlights of golden hair. Im looking forward to come here agai
4
On a busy Friday evening, Trattoria was the only viable option at Somerset with Marche's full, to my despair. Personally speaking, I think the dishes were all over-priced. The Penne arrabbiata was okay but I liked the gnocchi. In totality, the food was good though a little disappointing :) The service was slow so I suggest one keeps time when they plan to eat there... Overall, I recommend the place
3
It's convenient option for those looking for Halal food other than Muslim communities restaurants around Orchard area. According to them, they get meat & chicken from Malaysia "Halal" just make sure to inform them about using alcohol though. We had vegetables pizza, white sauce pasta, and squid-ink seafood pasta. All tasted fine but squid-ink "black" pasta one we enjoyed the most.
4
Went there with my boyfriend who is really found of Italian cuisine and a friend.The location is very convenient and the food was okay. The prices are interesting during lunch time, although during the evening where it is Ã  la carte the prices are too expensive for the quality of food you receive.What we truly appreciated was meeting the Italian manager who even took time to recommend us things to do in Singapore. He was really friendly.If I'd go back to Singapore, I wouldn't go back to this place as I believe there are many places to choose from. However, it was a nice experience
5
My boyfriend is italian and once he found this restaurant while walking around somerset, we just love this place! The manager and the chef are both italians from Naples, the service is very good. Some days of the week theres promotion, like ladies night and other stuff.Our favorite order is the pizza Cotto & Fungi, also we advice pizza Salsiccia Scarmosa and the pasta Tagliatelli in the red sauce. For dessert gelato is such a good option!Definitely the true italian food, after i taste that no pizza or pasta are the same, no comparison! Its a must try
3
Well this place is apt for a quick Italian lunch. The place in itself is your standard shopping Mall eatery with a fairly limited but decent options (menu). We tried the calamari starters...which was great. Portion was good and perfectly cooked. The beef Spaghetti Bolognese was nothing much to write home about. Very basic preparation...not something worthy of going out to eat.
5
Lovely place and staff. service was fast and excellent and the best part the pizzas, they were really mouth watering and tasty dont miss it. Its at 313 Somerset
5
Nice place with a good selection of pizza & pasta at a fair price. They serve nice red wine to make the dining experience perfect.
Certainly a Italian restaurant to go back to.
4
The pizza was great, nice crispy, thin crusts just the way I like it. Staff was very friendly and the food came surprisingly quick considering how busy they were. A bit pricey but then so is most of the other surrounding restaurants.
1
Don't waste your time, money and tastebuds here. The food is terrible, it tasted like something frozen you picked up from the supermarket and heated up yourself in the microwave. I can bet on it that their food are not made as you order but heated up as you order - I know this because our order took 3mins to arrive. My friend and I ordered a margarita pizza and the gnocchi noci pasta. Both laughable, tasteless yet very salty. The pizza literally was a thin piece of pizza bread with tomato paste sauce smeared over it. The noci pasta came out tepdi warm - they obviously didn't heat this one up for long enough! The owner guy with dark hair and glasses thinks his food is wonderful - well he obviously hasn't eaten it himself. $28 for the pasta, and $21 for the pizza. I don't mind paying for decent food but this was ridiculous. AVOID

I am sooo annoyed and agitated while I'm sitting and writing this review! My heart is palpitating and not in a good way. I moved to Singapore two weeks ago. My evening started off lovely.. A stroll from Ion Orchard to 313 Sommerset, I was excited to sit and have a lovel peaceful meal alone since my husband was overseas. What a mistake dining here! Overall the food was ok. Not too much taste like what I'm used to the Italian restaurants in Melbourne. The cocktail was lovely and nicely presented. What did my head in was the Italian manager. Each time he walked past my table, he would start singing out loud. Too loud for comfort. I couldn't understand why? I've been here once before with a friend and he was cold but didn't sing out loud. He didn't do it anywhere else apart from when he walked past me. He made me feel extremely uncomfortable as it wasn't jolly and genuine singing. I honestly feel as though he was trying to annoy me. It was really weird as I didn't look at him once. I kept looking and using my phone as I was dining alone. He made me very nervous and had a passive aggressive feel about him. He just didn't have a genuine feel about him as do most Italians that I have encountered in Melbourne. I was really hoping that this restaurant was going to be a regular for my hubby and I but I will never go there again. After spending $79 (for 1 person which I have no problem doing so if it's a great experience) I have a horrible nervous feeling after my experience there. I must note that his staff were absolutely lovely to me. They were efficient and their service was exceptional. My instincts are pretty good and the horrible feeling/vibe he gave me made me sick to my stomach. I need to find myself a new Italian restaurant!

I went to this place with different groups of people. We all happy here. First time we went around 2.30 p.m. It's quiet only 4 tables including us. They have some lunch special for Pizza and tea or coffee. So,we ordered that and found out Pizza was very good. Order wines 2 glass and get on glass for free. The services was excellent always came over check on us when our wine getting low. We never have to wait till glass empty. Although dinner at night quite frustrated. 3 of us arrived at 7 p.m. and 5 more coming from their office which is other part of City. It's took awhile. And staff kept coming over when the rest of us will show up. In this point in time 3 of us already orders 5 drinks to hold for happy hour. So, we don't really get it why they such a pushy about when rest of us will come. It was an uncountable time multiple waiters came over asking same question. One of us started to get moody about it. At the end they all came and we all ordered appetizers and main dishes plus beers and wines. We spent a few hundred dollars and happy with food But not service at that night. Even the white Caucasian manager came to explain they have many people waiting for table that why they have to make sure the rest of us really coming still not happy with that kind of treat. So, I decided to go with 2-4 group of people max for this place. I don't want to get that kind of frustration anymore.

I little surprise to see some reviewers mention that it is the best food they have every had. It makes me wonder if they have ever went into a decent enough Italian restaurant or was it just me that had an unfortunate experience. Nonetheless, this outlet is definitely to be avoided when there are so many other good restaurants around the area. You might as well go to the Marche next door where at least the quality of food is guaranteed. I went to the restaurant with two of my friends last year and two of them ordered an egg dish from the brunch menu and I ordered a spaghetti. However we were flabbergasted when the food was served. My friend's eggs benedict was soggy and the poached egg had fallen off the English muffin. The sauce already looked dry and when my friend took a bite, the poached egg was cold. The spaghetti sauce tasted like a product straight from the packet and it had a sticky texture. When we feedback to the staff, they had a nonchalant attitude which did not help. Even when we asked to see the manager, we were shocked when the manager just said "What do you expect?" So naturally we knew it was time to go so we paid the bill and left. Really disappointing experience and I hope the same will not happen to anyone else

Dinner time. We order pizza with provola and italian sausage and pasta with tomato sauce. Pizza dough was raw, spaghetti overcooked.

My dinner date and I selected it completely at random, as we were in Somerset 313 and were looking for something uncomplicated to eat, and we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at the Trattoria Italian Kitchen. We were immediately greeted upon walking up to the restaurant and shown to a table. The wait staff were just as attentive as the greeter, and remained so throughout our dinner. After a quick browse through the menu, we were ready to order, and the waiter made several helpful suggestions on drinks as we made our order. We ordered the insalata caprese, squid ink tagliolini seafood and linguine vongole. The mozzerella in the insalata was soft and creamy, and while the tagliolini was not of the squid ink variety, the sauce was delicious and the seafood plentiful with flavours that were lively and very fresh. The linguine vongole was tasty too, in a more aglio olio style vs. red sauce, and the clams were in abundance. The dinner (plus one takeaway pizza) came up to approximately $140, so while not cheap, it did indeed feel value for money as the quality of the food was excellent, the portions beyond generous and the service was attentive. I wouldn't make this an everyday affair, but would definitely consider Trattoria again for a tasty dinner out

The service was great & food was very nice. Lots of variety
Wednesday night is ladies night free flow wine

We went many times
Pizza is amazing
Mushroom risotto is perfect!!
Ravioli they changed the recipe and we didn't like the new one
Won't order ravioli again
Also price is a tad high for this area it's in

The restaurant is situated right at the exit of Somerset MRT at 313@Somerset mall, definitely an eye catching option for hungry MRT travellers. It has a nice atmosphere, in the middle of passing by mall visitors. Decent food and fast service.

Good, traditional Italian food! Very friendly service! Location somewhat noisy but in middle of Orchard Road. Very recommendable!

Went with friends and was not disappointed top notch food which was enjoyable and filling, bit expensive but most things are in Singapore

I was meeting a friend with his family for the dinner. My friends 3 sons wanted to try Italian Pizza. We ended up at this restaurant right next to the Somerset MRT. it was not crowded & we managed to get the place for 6 people very easily. We ordered Pizza, Pasta and our order was served very quickly. The service was good. The staff was courteous. The food portions were good. The food was cooked nicely. The pizza was thin crust one with nice flavors of Italian cheese. We all loved our food. At the time of bill payment the waiter mistakenly charged my card for the next table. We were still siting & chatting after paying the bill when he came back after realizing his mistake. He apologized multiple times for his mistake. It was ok. By the way they also have complimentary things for each day & on Thursday we were served Garlic bread & Bruschetta The prices are slightly in the higher side. But I don't mind paying a but more for good quality food. I am sure to visit this place again in future.

The food is average for the price that you shell out and they take the word al -dente very seriously.So much so that the pasta is uncooked and leads to an upset stomach.The staff at the front desk who assigns tables (looks italian) is demeaning in a subtle way.He is racist in his actions
3
I was here yesterday and the food was good. The pricing was a little dear but we could have had the set lunch which was cheaper.The atmosphere was nice but a little food courty I would give this place 3 and a half If I could the foot was nice and the staff were friendly if you have a hankering for Italian food and are around on orchard road then give this place a tr

Had an awesome time with the friends. This is the 2nd time I'm dining here. The location of the restaurant is really good and easy to find but it can get a bit noisy because it is located right in front of exit B of Somerset MRT. The food was really good. The truffle wedges was well cooked and delicious. We shared a few pasta and pizzas. The pizza I had was a caprese pizza. Just imagine a cooked Caprese Salad on a pizza. It taste so good. However, I think the pizza is more suitable to be eaten during breakfast or brunch instead of dinner. Overall it was a great experience and I don't mind going there again
3
This was an expensive night. Four meals were ordered and we made the mistake of not noting that prices did not include the 10% service charge and the GST. Two of the meals were acceptably priced and were tasty. The other two of us ordered the Trattoria Salad and for $23.50 SG each, we were grossly overcharged. Our salad was lettuce with several slices of olive, several half cherry tomatoes and two small pieces of feta cheese, lightly dressed. The service was friendly and the wait for food reasonable, although one meal came well after the others
2
Very crowded, staff were clueless and couldnt remember the orders. Expensive compared to other places. Food at mediocre level, service not attentive
1
Horrible and slow service. A bit expensive for such a service and quality of food. It was the first and last visit to this restaurant
3
We stopped here for a rest after a walk up Orchard Rd - the guy who runs it looked me up and down, was rude when we asked if we could just sit and have a drink.. I spoke to him in Italian and he completely ignored me. Basically sat us down then ignored us. However, the coffee was delicious, the pizza was sublime.. go for the food and the service from everyone else, not Gino the rude italiano..
5
We had an excellent dining experience at the Trattoria restaurant @313 somerset. Your employees were great! The seafood rolled pizza was the best pizza i've had in a while and its very mouthwatering dish. Vince the manager is just excellent! Friendly people and spotless restaurant! We will be back with our friends and family! Thank you for the unforgettable experienced! Best dining service that I've gotten so far

Went there and had dinner. The staff was very alert.. the ambience are just in italy. The food was really delicious. I odered a SEAFOOD TAGLIOLINI and it is the best ever!!Never you can get in Singapore!! The manager vincenzo is very friendly indeed. GOOD JOB TRATTORIA ! 5 STAR FOR YOU GUYS

We arrived late at this restaurant, as most of the restaurants close by had already closed their kitchens we decided to have dinner. We were greeted and seated promptly. For appetizer we had the fried calamari (delicious). For dinner we ordered meat lasagna (very tasty) and seafood ravioli, jumbo prawns in a crab sauce, also tasty. We honestly feel for what you get, the food and drinks are a bit overpriced. We did like the atmosphere and the waitress was friendly
1
We waited for an hour after ordering to finally get our food.. wine wasn't served in front of us.. my partner's food was served first and 20 mins after i followed up they told me if i could wait another 15mins cuz it's burnt (which i think they should've cooked a new one right away) we changed the order and took another 25 mins.. the only thing that's fast was when we get the bill..

Went for lunch during the holiday season and when I sat down the chair broke and I hurt my back. Deciding to stay - Ten minutes later someone asked me if I am ok and would like a medicine! We ordered - the food was poor and the service even worse. Was very disappointing. When I was leaving I spoke to an Italian gentleman and I thought he would offer an apology for the chair breaking - far from that. Perhaps someone from a regulator needs to visit them to address their poor approach to safety 
1
Ok food but the captain has horrible attitude. The rest if the staff seem to be totally pre-occupied with their tasks that they have forgotten their purpose of being is to delight their customers. I do not blame the staff but the poor leadership. Will not come back again.

The last time I dined at Trattoria Culina was years back, when 313 @ Somerset just opened. Well, good to know that this authentic Italian restaurant has planted its feet firmly here, despite the changing trends and other restaurants closing down, etc. Hence, it was time to revisit for a good old Italian dinner.For mains, we shared the Baked Lasagna with Bolognese and Bechamel (SGD$19.90) - tender layers of minced beef ragu enclaved between layers of cheese and pasta, a sticky and chewy delight, teasing the palate with rich flavors and texture.Then we also had a Ravioli Al Funghi (SGD$24.90) - pretty, scallop-shaped ravioli bursting with cheese , tossed in a delicious cream sage sauce. There were at least two types of mushrooms spotted, adding to the dish the distinctive sweetness of mushrooms. The ravioli was taut and once bitten in, the melting cheese exploded in the mouth. This was a fabulous selection.For dessert, we shared an Apple Crumble (SGD$9.90) - a delicious bowl of fresh apple cubes, rocks of pastry and a large scoop of vanilla ice-cream. It was warm and tasty, not too sweet, with the large rocks of crunchy crusts adding bite and flavor to the whole dessert overall.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/dinner-at-trattoria-culina-italian-313.htm

Had dinner here as they have open table for our party of 4 right away. Food was average, service was average. Nothing that I will remember for more than a week.

Located in the ground floor of the huge 313 Somerset mall, it feels like sitting outdoor in an Italian town... (Except that I wouldn't sit outside in hot an humid Singapore). Friday night - required us to stand in line to be seated. We wanted a light dinner. We took a pizza with chciken breast and pepperoni. The thin bottom was superb, and the covering too. We also had fried calamari. Not only rings but small heads as well. Very nice Dinner, very nice place

On a week-end you will be amazed at the enormous human traffic in that passage, connecting malls and MRT.This restaurant is highly efficient, tables turn several times a night, with an Italian managing the orchestra of busy but very friendly waiters. Usually even when full, a short wait will see a table getting free.This is not your romantic, calm restaurant where you would bring your first date, but the bustle and hustle will remind you of a typical Italian restaurant on a busy Milano street. The pizzas taste great, can recommend the special meat pizza, thin crust, plenty of ingredients. Well worth the SGD 30 or so dollars. They even do take-away
3
I find the restaurant just OK and the price is super exuberantly high. A glass of ice-tea almost $9++ The table are all cramped and closed to one another. No much of privacy. Menu are wide varieties but quality is just average. So if you can't find other restaurant, this your last resort

Trattoria used to be one of the go-to restaurants for my family and it honestly did have a very decent quality, the caprese pizza and four cheeses pizza was a must! But the past few visits have been disappointing, to say the least. Everything is just so bland and lackluster. The ravioli is just... disgusting. If it didn't cost so much and if I wasn't so obsessed with not wasting anyway, I wouldve left it after a bite or two. It tasted like... nothing, just cream and potato and it was all so... solid and pasty. yuck! I don't know if the management has changed or the chef, but both service and food quality has significantly declined. For a small restaurant, it really isn't too hard to ensure that everyone's needs are met. Clearly not for them. One time they served a dish that we hadn't ordered and when we called the waitress, she insisted that it was that dish when we clearly knew it wasn't. The description didn't match and we had had this dish before and it didn't taste anything like it. The waitress called the manager and she too joined in the insisting and went so far as to tell my mother 'You don't know anything!'Well that did it for us. Adios, Trattoria! Never again

Decided to have dinner at Trattoria last evening because it was crowded everywhere else but this place had ready seats available (probably a tell-tale sign). Remembered dining here many months back which was a mediocre experience but didn't remember it as anything bad. This time round we ordered a ceasar salad which was ok but at that price I reckoned it could have be of a better portion. The cabonara I had was dry and lacked seasoning. My partner had the handmade pasta with chicken breast and fungi where the pasta was served totally raw and crunchy and when we tried to send it back the server insisted it was done al-dente, when i insisted that i could tell between raw and al-dente she then unwillingly brought it back to the kitchen, when it was served again it was slightly more cooked but still had raw and crunchy bits. we didnt get through 1/4 of this dish. total damage for a disappointing meal? $78! I know for sure I'm never coming back here

Went for lunch today with my daughter as we were in 313. Ordered garlic bread and three meat pizza, with soft drink. The only positive point here was quick service, but then there were hardly any customers. The garlic bread had no punch in it. You could hardly taste either the garlic or butter. The bread also did not taste like freshly made, rather felt as if it was bought in bulk. If the restaurant had reasonable price, this could be overlooked, but when you charge premium price, we expect far better. The pizza was also a disappointment. The pepperoni was totally dry. The sausage and ham were the saving grace, but the cold cheese (as if the pizza was re-heated or defrosted) and a tasteless crust spoilt the entire show. And we paid around 48 SGD for this awful meal. The service was equally lackluster. The waiters had a bored & troubled look. The eatery is solely relying on the fact that it is in shopping district & has lot of non-regular customers like tourists or shoppers who need to eat during their shopping jaunts. But if they want returning customers they have to up their food & service to match the prices
5
We place our order and it was delivered within 15 minutes, just what we wanted after being out all day. We ordered a pizza, the crust was ultra thin so you really tasted the topping. We dined on a Tuesday and the meal came with a beer or soft drink. We had a good idea the meal was going to be good as the manager - Vincent is Italian. He took the time to talk to us. A delightful well priced mea

Found this Italian kitchen opposite the Somerset MRT exit. It was very busy and the ?manager persuaded us to wait until a table was found (in about 15 minutes). We ordered spaghetti and pizza which arrived very fast and was quite delicious. Each dish was about S$20. There as a football match on the TV and the atmosphere was quite Italian! The service was good and we did not feel rushed even thoug there was a big crowd
5
Ate there a couple of times, staff was very fast and polite, well trained, italian manager was great very polite, very friendly and very professional.I had the special of the day and it was delicious.Great deals on beers in the afternoon...A must visit if u in the 313 area..

i really like how just nice their carbonara is...plus their brownies with vanilla ice cream and a bit of cranberry sauce at the side is really something you can eat after a very stressful day:)

We had the pleasure to enjoy a real Italian atmosphere in la Trattoria restaurant during our trip back from Australia . We received a very welcome from the staff , the restaurant was booked up , and we had no reservation , but in less of 10 minutes , the Italian Manager organized a table for us , totally we where 8 persons. We order Pasta al Pesto , Gnocchi , Carbonara and Penne all Arrabbiata the Carbonara was excellent , but what has really amazed , where the Gnocchi al Pomodoro . It s not easy to find in Asia , who knows how to cook a great dish of Gnocchi . The service has been more then friendly , and considering that we where in the Shopping Gold Area , we find the price very reasonable. The dinner was accompanied by a background of Italian music . Thank you so much to the Trattoria staff . Hopefully to be back in Singapore soon

Had lunch at the restaurant today and it was an utter disappointment. My friend ordered an Eggs Benedict and we were shocked when the dish was served as the food was frankly slapped onto the plate with an obvious lack of interest to impress. For a dish that cost more than $23 and based on the location, I would expect a good food quality and presentation. However the muffins were totally socked through, the plate was covered with a cloudy egg water and the eggs had fallen off the muffins. When we returned the dish back, the Italian Manager even have the audacity to come and challenge us. He questioned what's our issue in a condescending tone, which made us feel disrespected. Without offering a solution, he walked away with no attempt or interest to turn around our dissatisfactory experience. Instead of behaving defensive, he should feel ashamed that they are serving such a dish to their customer. I did not enjoy my Fettucine Bolognaise either as you can taste that the sauce had been kept in the fridge for a very long time and the noodles were tougher than al dente. This restaurant belongs on the Gordon Ramsay's show "Restaurant Nightmare" and is in urgent need to improve their service and food quality. First on the list, change the restaurant as he is obviously not fit to run the establishment and incompetent for his role. Avoid this restaurant at all cost!!

Had lunch on Saturday while shopping at 313 and decided to try this place. Naturally given the indoor high-traffic location near MRT entrance this is not a quiet or romantic establishment. Our experience included friendly waitstaff and great 12-inch pizzas. Calamari appetizer was good too. Would visit again
3
We were spending time at malls by Orchard road and by coincidence we noticed this restaurant in a very crowded spot. We were looking for European food and for us, this place was good enough to find foods familiar to us but they were serving nothing extraordinary or nothing extra delicious. as the place was very crowded, I cannot define the place as a good dining spot if you are looking for tranquil place to eat 
2
I had been a faithful supporter for this restaurant for good many years.and i tell people to visit this restaurant because of the good food and services. However ,my recent visit had marred my experience . I gave it a 2 because I still believe the management will look into improving dining experience

Mt friend who lives in Singapore found this restaurant by accident as it was opposite the exit to the MRT(underground). So thought we would give it a try. The food was good and portion sizes filling. The staff were happy to accommodate my nephew (14yr) who wanted Pasta Arabiato with chicken, which was what he got and ate all of it!! The service was a bit hit and miss as was busy when we arrived, but manged to get a table for four people, whilst after that you had to wait. We had to wait to order our drinks while we choose what to eat, so decided to order garlic bread with drinks to tide us over then they came back for food order. So nice leisurely meal. Would go back agai

Lets start with the starter; Garlic Bread. You can't go wrong with garlic bread. Well actually you can. The utter mess of burnt edged bits of bread with some black and white stuff sprinkled over it. Edible but not appealing. Maybe its supposed to be rustic.So the main. Penne with Pesto and Pine Nuts should be bursting full of Olive Oil, Basil and Pine nuts IN the pesto, as well as pine nuts added for extra texture and flavour.What I got was mouthful after mouthful of barely warm pasta that was overcooked (not Al Dente) and the pesto was just "green". Thats it. Green. No taste at all. Absolutely NO TASTE.The pine nuts were soggy. I would avoid this place unless you really like a bad meal out. Personally I get better pasta at Pizza Hut.The staff seem to be unable to work out who is serving a table. I had at least three people try to take my order. S$50 for this plus a draft beer
4
The pizza and risotto we ordered was tasty. The food had taste. Difficult to find it in every Italian restaurant but the staff (Especially the females) is a concern. They are too rude, never have a smile on their face and would offer you with a grin. You would at once feel that they wanna say why the hell have you come here...!
2
Was looking forward to a meal at this restaurant, placed my meal order with the manager of the Trattoria, who already looked flustered before the night had even started to get busy. After waiting more than 30 minutes my starter did not arrive, I had to get his attention as he was not even interested in managing the table after the order was taken.The main arrived with no apology on why the starter did not arrive. Give credit to the other staff members as they put the manger to shame when it came to service. Food was good but service needs to improve a lot.
5
Im a regular at Trattoria, whenever Im in Singapore. Their pizzas are excellent, and their service standards are good as well. Can recommend the outlet for anyone looking for a good Italian meal at good price points.

By chance i found this one while iam
Looking for another one
The food great i realy enjoy it
Service so far so good
Coming back again in the near future
In my plans

great place .. where you can relax and enjoy Italian cuisine, friendly and professional service, I highly recommend

Good food , nice place, the italian girl serving us was so nice and professional as the staff around. Will be a pleasure coming back ....

Unusual and surprising to dine in an italian resto in a famous tourist destination place like Singapore with a paper table cloth...a turn down anyway. Food and service and price is on an average scale....will try another one then...won't recommend either.

My husband and I ordered the linguine vongole and penne arrabbiata, but unfortunately the penne looks like it just came out from a can of Chef Boyardee. I can completely understand the average Asian palate when it comes to the softness of the pasta as opposed to the slightly under cooked penne. But the sauce is not up to par. It didn't help when we follow-up with the cafe manager and I asked him about the quality of the dish and informed him that it was arguably one of the worst pasta we ever had. Instead of enquiring further to understand what was the problem with the pasta sauce, he kept reiterating and insisting on how great the chef was and outrageously told us that he can't help if we don't like the dish! We are seasoned travelers and no novice when it comes to good pasta dishes. This gentleman definitely needs more training when it comes to customer service. It's unfortunate you would employ such substandard staff. What a turn off!Thankfully another fellow staff was apologetic and actually took the time to show concern about our unfortunate encounter with the above gentleman and made the effort to ask what was wrong with the dish. The cafe manager shouldn't be in this industry and his staff should've been the choice for manning this restaurant. He showed maturity and professional decorum. I've emailed this incident to the Managing Director and also to the management via the official website of Trattoria. To my utmost disappointment, I've heard nothing from either the MD or the management. It has been more than a week since I emailed the MD. Conclusion, bad service and food as well as PR. Never again I will set foot in this restaurant.

Traveling with two teenagers ran into 313 Orchard Road to get out of the storm. Saw Illy coffee and a proper espresso machine (not push button) so sat down for a coffee. Very good coffee for Singapore. Got caught up in the malls of Orchard Road, time got away, time for lunch and with millions of choices found ourselves back near Trattoria Singapore.Lunch special $11.50 plus tax gets a choice of two or three pasta dishes, pizzas or sandwiches plus a soft drink. Mushroom pasta was hot for us. Penne pasta dish was mild. Prawn pizza (9 inches) was nice and tasty.Friendly quick service at a reasonable price
1
Ordered a plate with pasta and mussels. The mussels were not open on two of our plates and the waitress tried to convince us that they were still fresh. She eventually said that a new set would be cooked but you could tell that the returned plate of mussels were pried open. She then spoke to her Italian lady manager and muttered a four letter word. Both had a black face after. All four of us left unhappy with the bad service and bad attitude. The whole point is that they could have admitted to their mistake, be apologetic and offered an exchange willingly. The other mains that came were also sub standard, nothing like the Trattoria in Bali. Hopeless restaurant and we shall never return.
2
Our family wanted a good finish of a busy afternoon at Orchard and expected a nice Italian dinner. Unfortunately the food was at best average while the price with 50 SGD per person was on the higher side. There are far better places in Singapore to eat for 50 SGD. Every dish left the impression of heated up standard. Nothing special, not very tasty and for sure not homemade. It would have been ok for a quick bite for half the price but that was quite poor

I walk by this restaurant virtually every day and I have always been curious, so I finally decided to give it a try. It was just a quick dinner after work so I wasn't looking for anything fancy and wasn't expecting a mind blowingly good meal; just nice simple run of the mill Italian comfort food would do. After all, what would you expect from a place called Trattoria? Sadly, they can't even execute a simple and basic Bruschetta. I ordered the Bruschetta and Carbonara pasta. The Bruschetta was horrible. The bread was of cheap quality (lowest of the low in my book) and the Bruschetta mixture was a bland mix of tomatoes with a measly amount of basil and olive oil. It completely lacked flavor and seasoning. Easily the worst Bruschetta I have ever had. The crazy thing is, Bruschetta is something REALLY HARD TO GET WRONG, so if you can't get a good Bruschetta to customers, then all I can say is wow. Tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, some olive oil and maybe some balsamic vinegar depending on your style. How hard is that?On the other hand, the Carbonara pasta was actually pretty decent. The carbonara sauce was done up properly and it was actually pretty good and pretty flavorful. Pasta was cooked al dente. But the location of this restaurant -you are basically in a high traffic area inside a mall near the MRT entrance and the majority of the seating (or so it appeared) is not "inside" (I use that term lightly) away from the madness- coupled with service staff that looks completely uninterested in what they are doing, are reasons enough to not come back. I would have the pasta again though
