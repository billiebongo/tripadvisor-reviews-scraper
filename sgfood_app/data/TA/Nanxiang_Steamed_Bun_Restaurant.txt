Been here many times , favorite is the Xiao long bao and desserts like the pumpkin cookies , personally think the taste is nicer than the famous Ding tai fung

I love the Hakaw! The siomai is great!
I love drinking the soup that is wrapped in siopao. The dessert with pomelo is refreshing.

We were at Juntion 10 for their STEAM POT buffet, cook or fried foods were hot and delicious. No rice was provided as they were only given 2 choices of porridge to be put into the pot and will only be serve after we finished the steaming foods (I think). But still it was a healthy meal for everyone to have

The new steamboat offering in the restaurant is excellent! It's literally a "steam"-boat, where you steam the meat, seafood and vegetables on the metal plate. Ingredients are fresh, and definitely worth the value with a great selection of scallops, mussels, shrimp, dumplings and meats. Be sure to leave space for the surprise at the bottom before leaving, porridge at the bottom flavoured by the steamed ingredients

This place is near my office and I bring my colleague for business dinner. It is a good place for business dinner after work and they serve good quality Chinese food. I order a set meal of 2 and there are many dishes. Good quality Chinese restaurant just the price is a little high. As describe as their restaurant name, recommend to try the Xiao long bao. So far this is one of the food I like here

It's about a year since I was last at this place in Bugis. Once again I came here for lunch having taken the downtown line from Raffles Place. Arriving at around 12.30pm the restaurant was about two thirds full and there was no problem getting a seat. We ordered a selection of dumplings, noodles and buns all of which were quite tasty. THe price was a little higher than I was expecting (extra cost for the napkins, the peanuts, and the tea) but was still ok value at about $60 for 2

We went into this place and the friendly staff showed us to a table straight away and presented the huge menu of different food from meat, veg and all the famous Chinese dishes. If you know your Asian food well come here and get the taste of China. The tables are clean and there is not much crowds as its upstairs rather than near other food halls. We will come again just for those very good dumplings

When check online the review look ok, so get the voucher from AllDeal$120, when reach there, the staff ask for voucher, than only bring to table. After order, the food came very fast, all in table , but half of it is warm(not hot), the staff ask faster eat the food, coz they can out other dish. When I saw the food I shock, how come so many and the staff didn't tell me I over order, I have 5 adult and 1kid, before that we just have buffer lunch. So I ask any more order, the staff say have dessert and 2 more(I can't recall) I ask can help cancel the balance order, coz Is really too much, the staff say nvm, u finish 1st , than c how. What is the meaning of c how ? I already tell is too much, i need cancel and since the order is haven do, why still ask me finish the food? The food quality are so so only, oily and salty, 50% if the food I can't finish, so need take away, the staff ask me how can't take away, I tell her the food quality so so and salty so she say why I didn't tell early so they can take out the food. I want ask staff top up the tea, keep c the staff group and chit chat. When I ask for bill, the staff ask me go infront pay, go there. When at payment I saw the bill I shock again, the price I can go 5 star hotel and eat a proper Chinese food, with good staff attitude. When I ask check the order of bill, they just charge to my card 1st and show me black face and I hear small talk behind,it make me fell uncomfortable and shame, coz the staff share the topic I check for my order in front the staff and the customer there. The attitude and service of staff, I still pay for service tax . With the quality of food compare price I pay, I think I should book 5 star hotel. I won't go again and also not recommend my friend go

This place is a short trek from the CBD area, but with 2 MRT lines now operating to Bugis it's quite easily accessible at lunch time. Quality of food is good, friendly staff, and good value for money. We came here at 12.30 on a Friday lunchtime and there was no queue (which is certainly not something one can say about Din Tai Fung at MBFC). This was my 3rd visit and I will come back again

Can try their beef dish, not bad. Went there a few times after buying coupon from online to use. Ordered their scallop soup which is aroun 6.50 sgd, and their noodle which is around 6.80 sgd. Their noodle portion was big. Their xiao long bao is also not bad, worth to try :
