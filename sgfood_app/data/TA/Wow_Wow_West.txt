Located in ABC Food Centre, this western food stall serves the usual localised western food - chicken chop, pork chop, fish & chips, chicken cutlet etc. The serving is huge compared to other similar stalls, and food quality is better than most. Worth a try.

Fish & Chips - Good batter. Fresh fish. Nice coleslaw. Serving portion is huge if you finished all the fries.Chicken Chop - Tender meat. Fragrant.Slightly more expendive than the normal western hawker stall but it worth it, considering the serving portion. It always long queue but thrir service is fast

Heard about this place and finally got the chance to try it. The queue is long and you cannot missed the stall. It is located right at the end of the hawker center.The ordering is actually quite fast and efficient as there are only 7 things (on the menu).Also the food is made quite fast (considering the queue and amount of orders they have).The portions are huge (compare with others) and almost could not finished the food. First time this has happened when eating western food (as always not enough).If you are small eater better share with somebody.The chicken chop is a little bland. The chicken cutlet is crispy and a better choice. The fish and chips is good although a little soggy (not sure why). The pork cheese sausage tasted the best although the skin is a little hard.Overall the food is worth the price you are paying and waiting time

Review by Dr Sim. I usually go there for dinner. Outlet does not seem to be open for lunch. Good value for money Western Food by Chinese hawkers. Seems a paradox. Self Service. Try the Chicken Chop, Pork Chop, Beef Steak and Sausage. All good. Usually long queue. No air-conditioning. Tourists can buy back to the hotel to eat. Regards Dr Si

There are many western food stalls in various coffee shops and hawker centers throughout Singapore, however Wow Wow West really stands out with their excellent chicken chops and fish and chips! The fish and chips cost $7 for each plate, however the serving is very generous! If you are in ABC Market, which happens to have many other good food choices too, I would recommend that you share a plate of either the chicken chops or fish and chips among your friends especially if you are not a big eater! The batter on the fish and chips is done very well and they are generous with the fries on the side. Be careful to come down during dinner time on a Saturday evening, the queues will be very long. However I must say that they do have an efficient ordering system that moves the queue faster than you would expect. Enjoy

This is one of the best Western food hawker stalls I have ever come across in Singapore. You get lots of food for a pretty cheap price here. The food comes out relatively quickly hereWe ordered the chicken chop and pork cheese sausages, and liked them both. We’re too full to even get up from the table. The thick chicken chop, almost jellylike in its tenderness and with homemade coleslaw and French fries sitting politely by the side, looks positively delightful. The uniquely ultra-delicious pork cheese sausages have a smooth and creamy texture. it had that serious punch and kick and you get that cheese also in the same bite and it had a nice snap when you cut into it and bit. Hands down my favorite.Only catch is, be prepared to queue. If you’re reading this then you’re just one of thousands trying to work out when is the best time to go and how on earth you can avoid that god forsaken queue.A friend of mine always raved about this place & I finally got around to trying it. Now I understand what all the hype is about! It’s a worthy stop when you just want a piece of sausage, flawlessly prepared. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…wow wow west si

Saw this stall in TV program called Food Republic & quickly drove there at 3:30pm. The shutters were 3/4 closed with boss inside & son-in-law outside cleaning & clearing utensils & cutleries. My heart sank when he said, "Sorry, we are closed but open again at 5pm". So, i called up to Eric Ng the boss, who's hidden inside, & related how i rushed here all the way from the East after watching the TV program abt them. To my big surprise, Eric came out & said, he will cook for me. Wow, what a kind hearted & genuinely a good soul. I ordered his signature dish, the famous Chicken Chop. Chicken was thick & juicy. Brown sauce was watery but tasted ok. Chips were fried cripsy outside & soft inside. Coleslaw was cold & refreshingly tasty, crunchy too. Baked beans were just adequate, about 3 tablespoons. As one earlier review reported, i do agree that the chicken does give a 'from the frozen meat' taste. For $6, i would reckon it's considered worth the money for such s big portion of everything & tasted better than others, though not my number one ranking. Perhaps, my next trip, i would love trying the Pork Chop & Beef Steaks since Eric & his son-in-law are such nice people worth supporting. I'm so glad that Eric is determine to bless others who are less fortunate in life. Kudos & keep up the zeal & compassion.
