This cafe was located just a short walk from our hotel & was our venue for breakfast on two mornings. There is a good variety of local food at a very reasonable price. Service is quick & efficient!

Nothing really novel about this cafe despite the prices matching Starbucks and other such chains. Stick to brands on this one.

Good , quick variety of food ....something for everyone.Besides meals , there are good fresh juices & freshly cut fruit of different types.It's a local eating place frequented by folks working in the neighbourhood. Inexpensive place .Went there everyday for fruits & juices since it was near my hotel .... Will recommend for a quick everyday meal.It's very good for the amount you pay but it's not a destination mea

The atmosphere was buzzing in the Plaza - and we chose this particular eatery because of the food they were offering and the comfortable dining arrangement - and it was quiet on the night we ate there - so we got great service - At the Cuppage we had a woodfire Pizza which tasted amazing and it was supplemented with each of us having drink - myself a mocktail and my husband a local beer - so good food and good service made this an ideal location for our first night in Singapor

We were looking for a quick snack and wandered down between "The Cuppage" and the adjacent Cuppage Plaza. Upon entering the north end we found a very busy little eatery. After having a closer look we decided there was food there that we would like to try. Turned out to be a good idea. We got 1 type of meat and rice or noodles and 1 vegetable selction for $3!!! (other size portions are available) Food was very tasty and good. Very popular place with the locals by the look of it. We went back for tea and it was closed and being scrubbed down and sanitised. I guess they had sold out. We will go back there again when we dont want a big main meal
