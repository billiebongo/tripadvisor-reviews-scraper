Miss this CKT and it decided to bring a friend along.
As usual, it did not disappoint.
Well-fried with good wok fire.
Love every morsel of it. Seems to shrink in size though.

A young lady had taken over. During my last visit a couple of months ago, the noodle tasted limpid and I was disappointed.Today, I saw a queue and took the risk to have another go. Frying 2 plates worth and she does the finishing individually. Well fried as you could taste the liveliness of the noodle. Still lacking some wok hei which I am sure she will master over time. I am sure more to come.

One of my all-time Penang CKT (white version).The wok-frying skill of the owner is top notch. No rush, no fuss, just pure skills. Behind the grumpy face, you get to taste the "wok-hei" of each plate as he fry 1 plate each time. Nothing less with each plate.
