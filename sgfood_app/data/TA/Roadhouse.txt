Place was indeed popular. Fortunately we made a reservation. Food was great and staff were attentive.

The service was great! I like how the staff are so friendly. Thank you for the surprise for my son's birthday
2
Terrible service.... The waitress was on her phone the entire time we were there.
We were the only people in the restaurant and still had difficulty in getting their attention. The only positive was the size of the wine!
3
The unit is hidden at a corner. The last unit. Therefore if you drive it is unlikely it can be viewed properly. The direction sign is not clear.
However, the food is acceptable. If go early, likely to have some quiet and peaceful meal.
4
The restaurant serves decent burger. However, onion rings were too oily. Overall good dining experience, especially during non peak hours. Waitress was attentive and service is good. Slightly expensive.
4
Food is nice. Awesome place. Nice place for family or friends gathering. Will definitely recommend this place to friends.
5
Stayed here last night on invitation of our Friends, this place was wonderful,nice relaxed atmosphere and supernice food + great service, we had the chicken burger, the ribs and ceaser salad and all of them were really ecxellent ! Staff were very attentive the place seems to be well managed
3
We loved having a family and friends night at roadhouse, however not that the menu has changed you cannot customise your burgers for tables greater than 8 pax? Also the service has gone downhill. The new soft serve machine was fun for the kids though. Not sure if we will be back
4
If you are looking for good burgers and nice place to hang out, this is an ideal place. It is unpretentious and atmosphere just right for burgers, fries, etc. You must try their stuff and breaded mushrooms for the starters. Unfortunately, they only have Budweiser for their beer selection
1
1:00-1:05 group of ten arrive (2 families)1:15 First contact with service staff - water1:21 have to ask one of the waitresses to take our order - probably six staff attending to about thirty guests and it took fifteen minutes to place an order1:35 First item arrives - a half size milk shake.1:39 Second item arrives - a second half size milk shake of the same flavour. Don’t know why they couldn’t make two at once???1:42 Ask waitress to at least bring the one beer we ordered.1:47 Still no beer - go up to counter to get myself. They can’t find a bottle opener ....1:50 onwards: kids meals and the occasional milkshake arrive. Also some onion rings which are nothing but batter - terrible.2:05 Adult meals begin to arrive. An hour after arriving and 45 minutes after ordering - in the mean time families that arrived after us have eaten and left2:10 Another visit to the counter to get two milkshakes that had been forgotten.2:10-2:30 Consume burgers which are ok, but with tasteless fries. Kids don’t eat much.Approx 2:40 pay and leave almost two hours after arriving with the kids throwing their soft serve ice creams in the bin.This is such a disappointment - not just Roadhouse, but the complete lack of family friendly restaurants with reasonable service in Singapore. In eleven years here we still struggle to find places - such a huge market opportunity that Roadhouse, and countless other restaurants, have failed to grab

good burger, price was slightly overpriced , service was average. Definitely come here for the burger don't come here for eggs/bacon etc or anything else. Its a burger joint not salmon with eggs Benedict type of place.
FYI: there are no toilets/bathroom in the restaurant.
4
Great sides, free-flow soft drinks, good value in a quiet part of town. Would return. Food took a little longer than expected to come but service was excellent -- they even split the bill fourways for us!
3
Good service, but let down by inconsistencies with quality of the food. Fries and standard burger were fine, but falafel burger was undercooked and avocado harder than the cutlery.
More care and attention on the food quality will make or break this place.
5
Great service, Roadhouse gave us a complimentary cake since it was my boyfriend's birthday. They even gave him a birthday card signed by the staff! A definite 'A' for the experience!
4
Apart from the burger challenge, the food portion was sufficient and tasty. Fries were cooked to almost perfection and ambience on a weekday was quiet and serene.
4
The burgers were really tasty and the service staffs are really helpful and with full of initiatives which you rarely get this kind of good service nowadays. They had made our dinning really pleasant and felt really welcoming in the restaurant. Will go back again:)
5
Was celebrating birthdays for two friends and the restaurants prepared cakes and something special. Very thoughtful! And of cos we enjoyed the burgers! Good value.
4
The burgers are good. I ordered the day's special that had buffalo wings in the burger. Boneless of course. This is our second time there. Will go back again. My only suggestion to the kitchen would be to let the fries drain a little bit more. They were nice, hot, meaty but a tad too oily. Other than that, great burgers. Of course, not forgetting the staff ... prompt, polite and pleasant.
3
Nice place tucked in the corner. Good family place. Burgers were good. Patties were decent sized and the fries were good too. My only complaint would be the service. They seat you, hand you the menu and disappear. We waited for some time and had to call the waiter to place our orders. The restaurant is small and not crowded.
3
Burger was excellent, flavorful and juicy beef patties. Ordered the Swiss mushroom burger, wife ordered the naked burger. Both excellent.The place is not packed, with more than enough staff but end up only 1 server working. The rest, not sure what they were doing. Will go back for burgers but only if you can tolerate the lack of service
2
Was surprised with the poor choice on the menu and quality of food served.
It used to be much better.
5
Awesome pulled pork burger but the chicken burger Is very disappointing
Awesome and value for money truffle fries
Onion rings was good
3
Was going to try the Super giant burger big breakfast but told they have changed menu. No more breakfast big burger. Wagyu burger patty is juicy but not much taste. Will I go back again? Not really for the existing menu.
4
They had just changed the menu when we visited. New menu is $10 for a regular Burger set, $16 if it's wagyu beef. The portion is big. Burger was nicely done. The milkshake was also yummy. Will visit again.
5
We went here as friends. The place was packed for dinner. They were accomodating and very attentive.
The food was awesome with their pasta, ribs, and the burgers. They also have a bday cake for my friend.
This is a place to be for celebrations.
4
As usual the burgers were very good, when they eventually arrived. The restaurant was not particularly busy, which was unusual, but we did not get our food for more than half an hour.
2
Came with a few people from work. When ordering one of us asked if he could order an extra pattie. The response was "Sorry I am an intern. I can't tell you." We had to find another member of staff to let us order it. When my burger arrived it was completely cold. The egg was cold and congealed. I would have rejected it but it had taken 40 minutes to arrive and there were only two people there before we arrived. I had to get back to work, wasn't going to wait for another one and didn't have time to eat elsewhere which is what I wanted to do. Finally when we finished another member of staff asked if everything was okay. I said my burger was cold. She said okay and walked off.
5
Three years ago, I was already impressed with the food and ambiance of Roadhouse. Thus,when my girlfriends decided to have a dinner I have recommended this to them. As usual,service was awesome and their wagyu burgers and milkshakes are fantastic! I recommend that you order your burger medium rare to have that tasteful and juicy bite! Oh and dont forget to partner it with their Texas Beef Chili Cheese fries! By the way, the manager or owner (Im not sure who is he) and the chef, were very accommodating to our request to cook pork bbq ribs even it wasn't in their new menu. We had a great time and left the restaurant with all smiles and full stomach! :) Kudos to you guys!!

Nice little Burger joint. Started with a Nutella & Banana milkshake, but they had run out of bananas... Had the strawberry I stead and it was amazing. Ordered a customized burger with caramlized onions and gorgonzola cheese and it was delicious. It was served with fries that I never touched, as they had clearly been reheated from the party of 10 that was already present on our arrival... this could have been 100% burger satisfaction, but you don't serve reheated fries with a 5* burger - it's just criminal!
4
Finding a genuinely good burger in Singapore is tough. Very tough. RoadHouse is one of the better choices. We had the triple bacon burger with Gorgonzola which was good. Fries not quite cooked at the right temperature though pretty darned close. Coleslaw served with the burger was quite good. The parmesan wings are also good. We ordered the mildest which was for me a nice buzz on the tastebuds while my Wife wanted a little hotter. Their wings I think do run a bit hotter than most. Overall a good experience. Took the kids who like the desserts. Mid-level prices by Singapore standards. A good place to go if you crave that juicy burger with fries and beer.
4
Cozy place with good food. We were a little lost finding the venue. Took us about 15 mins before we find the location. Should have more directional signage.
4
Two diners, wanting a good hot dog and a good burger, and we got what we waited. Great fries came with my dog, which was s bonus. I was surprised that the beer selection was limited, and without draft beers. I expected a place called Roadhouse to have a draft beers, and good ones. The bottled beer selection was fine, but I would pair with a local brewery and give folks a full roadhouse experience.
4
I am a burger lover but I have not had a good burger for quite some time. So when I found this place, I was glad. The size of the burger was just nice. The beef patty was juicy & tender. Their sides such as mushroom, bacon, cheese & foie gras were delicious. The staffs were friendly & checked on us despite that they were having a full house. They also gave balloons to young children as they were about to leave the restaurant. One minus point was that we waited more than half an hour to get our food. Probably because they were full. Thankfully I made a reservation before we went.
4
Had one of the best BBQ baby back pork ribs in a while - tender meat that slips off the bone. Sauce also not too sweet and overwhelming. They have this char siu burger that's simply devine, and such good value for only $16. Go for the unlimited soda fountain too. Brings back memories of life in the USA

Roadhouse is one of the dining places we repeatedly patronize. Love the food especially their burgers, fries and also chicken & mushroom aglio olio. Very kids friendly place with activities such as colouring, word search etc. printed behind each kids menu. My kid especially love the little "library corner" of children books available for them to read while waiting. We are always greeted by their friendly and helpful staffs even on busy days.

This is the second time I come to Roadhouse eating American Burger. I am quite censorious on food. But the first time I come here, they serve me very good! Their regular burger is taste fantastic. So I thought this time I can try something more personal, building up my own burger. They provide me a detailed menu with several choice. Honestly, I am very satisfied. But I need to ask for the rule. Some restaurant provide a basic set including necessary vegetable, cheese. I don't want to make any fault. So I ask waitress that do they have the basic set when I choose to build up my own. She said yes. And she said it is including a fries. Well, I don't want a fries so I change it to a onion rings. And I ask for extra pickles since they already have a basic set. After 15 minutes waiting for my burger, it finally come. I am really shocked!!! It comes up with a burger which only have pickles and meat. Then I ask waitress what happened to my basic set? She said she never said there is a basic set. I misunderstand her words. I cannot accept it. Then she give me another choice that I can choose the extra and cheese right now. She will send my burger back to kitchen to place them. I asked one more time: can they re-cook my meal? Because there is cheese on it. No one want a cold cheese. She said yes. Then I wait for another 5-7 minutes she serve my meals back. But when I cut it into two half burger, the cheese is never melted. And when I eat it, the meat is already cold. I really cannot accept this. When they tell you something, then they do another thing. It is really a deception. Whatever, I think I won't come to this restaurant again. Just write this thing down to warn you guys. Please be careful when you choose this restaurant.

I have a visited Roadhouse a number of times and their burgers never disappoint. The josper-grilled wagyu patties are juicy, tender and full of flavor! An order of the burger comes with a side of fries and coleslaw which is filling enough and pretty value for money.For a large group, it is recommended to order the Terminator challenge, but without the challenge. What's better than have six patties to share and just two buns (less carbs!)!We ordered an option out of the ordinary, fish and chips, to give it a try. It was alright, but not spectacular. It is best to stick to the burgers as that's what the eatery does best

Decided to go to Roadhouse since we wanted burgers and an American diner experience. Well......me and my friend walked up to the place and well, from the photos online, we were thinking the place would have a diner booth feel to it. Nope. First round of disappointment.It took us about five min after we sat down to place our order. I created my own burger with milkshake. I mean, come on... how can you not order burgers and shakes.It took nearly 25 min for our order to arrive. For such a tiny portion, we demolished the food within the first ten min upon its arrival. Including the milkshake. The beef was done beautifully, but, to be honest, McDonalds or other burger fast food joints had bigger portions than the Roadhouse.All in all, the time it took for us to sit down, order the food, finish it, was much faster than the food arriving to our table. And the price...... not worth it at all. go to McDonalds.......... give this place a miss
5
My family went to Roadhouse to celebrate my father's 72nd Birthday. The food is great, as usual. Even my normally fussy and Chinese food oriented mother found the food here to be fantastic. The staff were attentive. They made sure that the table was cleared, the nearby fans were off before bringing in the complimentary slice of cake (nicely decorated) for my father. He was pleasantly surprised. So i would say the whole experience was truly enjoyable
4
After a busy morning of Gym and school exams ( yes UWCSEA where my daughter attends had exams on Saturday) we decided for a late lunch.We decided on burghers and we wet to Roadhouse at Dempsey,, it was great reasonable price $16 for a burgher and we had these really delicious buffalo fries.The burghers were delicious also and we're firm and moist with fresh salad and chilli.Definitely will be going back 
4
Food good. Friendly staff and great service. Place away from the city hustle and bustle. Set lunch include free flow of soft drink @$16++. Menu include Pull pork burger, Fish and chips, chicken burger, cheese burger, Parmesan wings Etc. Big portion as well.
3
Hear good things about Roadhouse and I think it was better the first time we went. This time it was a bit hectic, food wasn't great and service a bit slow.
5
Hard to beat the Bacon Marinated Burger. Any more pork, this would be a pork chop. Cooked to perfection and match with the biggest onion rings ever seen. If you looking for burger bliss - this is a place to try.
5
Excellent service, good food and atmospheric environment. The burgers that are served with fries are definitely worth a try. Also, the top up $2 truffle fries are amazing.
5
Great place, great food and great service! They even surprised my wife with a birthday dessert! Highly recommended!
5
We were looking for a burger bar & roadhouse was just perfect for our management team, atmosphere was perfect with excellent menu, yummlicious burgers, the group enjoyed totally
4
Not too packed, good for a restful weekend. Place was a little hard to locate, may improve on this. Delighted with this caucasian waiter who assisted us very patiently.
4
Came here for lunch on a Saturday and enjoyed our meal. The concept of "Build your Own Burger" is good, as people have different tastes and we both ordered custom Chicken burgers. This is a proper burger. good meat, nice addons and the fries were good too. Sodas have unlimited refills which i always consider a plus. This is a nice little American Diner style burger place which is good if you feel like having a burger in Singapore :-
5
Totally enjoyed ourselves at Roadhouse.The burger (we ordered the chillie corn carne n cheeseburger)...both parties were burnt nicely, and still juicy. Yummy. The chillie corn carne is a tad salty, but forgivable when mixed with the bun.The big Onion rings...haha, funniest looking ever. And does remind me of the Indian snack...vad

I was looking for a quaint and quiet place for a casual business lunch... Roadhouse at Dempsey. Went there at 12noon, but by 12:30pm - it was full!Went for the Bacon-marinated Burger - asked for a sunny-side up... love the flowing egg yolk in my burger! Looked kinda small for $25, but it was filling and filled with goodies! Tasted excellent, especially with the blue cheese (I'm a sucker for blue cheese). The fries or chips (depending on which side of the North Atlantic Ocean you're from) were good too.It's tucked away on Block 13, on the same block and left of Wood Farm. It's in the area of Dempsey that has ample parking.Service was good - the service staff tried to please, made recommendations and well-versed with the menu. Appreciate that very much.Yes, I will be back for more burgers at Roadhouse
2
Fries felt like they were saved from yesterday and cooked again, so were the wings which were so disappointing it detracted from the fairly okay burgers. Not worth my $40 a person!!! I could've eaten better at many other places.
5
Thank staffs from Roadhouse making my fiancee's birthday dinner celebration awesome! It ended with a surpise birthday dessert as requested !! We will revisit Roadhouse again !!!
4
Celebrated my boyfriend's birthday at the restaurant. The service was great as they have us complimentary soft drinks and a slice of ice-cream cake with a lighted candle.
Delicious burgers!
4
Pork sliders was awesome, but expensive. Place was "echoy", and hence loud. Best part was the milkshake, but was $11(?). Good food but not good value.
4
It is pretty quiet for a friday night!!
the food is good, im surprise it is not packed!
but it is good for gatherings and chit chat!!
3
No the best experience, one hour sharp before our burgers came. They gave us a discount on a expensive bill. I'm sure there are better options around.
5
The Roadhouse offers varied menus for parents and kids, and executes these very well. Service staff is attentive and tries to accommodate where possible. And then there are the books kids can read while waiting (what do you mean "need an iPad"?). Good stuff!
4
Love their fast and efficient service. Gotta try their waygu beef patty if its your first time there. Medium rare was so good.
3
I've driven past this place quite a few times and finally go to check it out.The menu options look great. The burger looked great, but the taste was average. Definitely have had better burgers in singapore, but I think it was down to the burger being cooked well done when I asked for medium.I also don't like it when food is served separately... meaning my wife got her food, and 7mins later I got mine. Milkshake was fantastic. Service was good.Saying that, I might go back and give it another try
4
Roadhouse, is a great American style diner in the heart of Dempsy serving classic American style burgers. They do have other diner style food but really it is all about the Burgers at Roadhouse. The burgers are cooked to your liking and you can pretty much build them as you like. They offer a good kids meal with refillable soft drinks. We have found the service very good, but to be fair the restaurant was fairly quiet both times we have been. The burgers are by no means cheap but so far we are yet to find a better burger in Singapore
5
it was absolutely perfect. the food fabulous
we will return here more often
The perfect Burger!
Thank you
5
Pulled pork burger amazing. Great service and a friendly environment. Simple idea having books for kids to read keeps them busy. Magic for kids might even see a wee lizard on the window.
4
Excellent burgers - juicy, just done right on the josher grill & our kid was able to read all the books available there with a kid's menu
4
Pretty decent burgers, definitely above average (especially if you can't stand macdonalds and think frozen patties are an abomination). Beer is good too, so really a safe option for a burger!
2
The food has been disappointing compared with previous trip to roadhouse. Food I ordered was not fresh and tasted like frozen food. The manager there was grumpy and unfriendly. We will unlikely go back there again.
5
Both of our time visit. We ordered 2 burgers and everything is good. And we won the 50% off total bill! Monday perks promo! ;) and even bumped into gurmit! Haha
5
We reserved a table online for a Saturday night dinner. Good choice, since restaurant was otherwise filled-up when we got there. We got a table just under the aircon, but the staff was very nice to immediately turn-off the blow of wind onto us.The place was popular for a reason, as we experienced. Build-your-own burger let's you have it however you like, and the outcome didn't disappoint us. We had an excellent meal and can highly recommend the place for anyone craving a burger
2
We were all in the mood of finding the best Burger in singers but the service was a total shambles. Despite repeating our orders for the kids (2 of them), it came wrong. For my middle childs order, we said we wanted fish and chips unfortunately they do not serve it but they can serve chicken with batter like the fish and chips so we agreed to that. The waitress asked the the chef first as we requested. When the dish came, it was a btoiled chicken and not battered chicken. We told the waitress that it was not what we agreed. She aologised and asked for the dish to be corrected. What come next was a battered fish instead of chicken!!. Which we agreed to get as she said that the fish dish they had was only pan fried. So this was a big mistake on their ordering part. For my eldest daughters order, we specifically said no sauce and no mushrooms in the burger but it came with it. So we ask to return it. The waitress made it sound as though we made a mistake!. Then the best joke was the desserts the girls order, brownie with a scoop of ice cream... the brownies was rock hard and cold. Kids nor us couldn't cut into it. So again we asked the waitress how it was done as we never had a cold and hard as a rock brownie. The waitress apologised and said it should be microwavedone. The adults order was right. It's a pity despite the burger was nice, the experience was enough for us to not come back.

On 16 Apr 2016 (Saturday) evening, had some craving for beef burger. Searched on the Internet and found this "Roadhouse" located at Dempsey Hill. Decided to make a trip there.Order one of their signature beef, bacon, egg, potato burger (forgotten the name) which is SGD $24. It took approximately 20 minutes before the food was served. The fries were great, coleslaw good. Did not expect the burger to be of big portion. Decided to remove the potato before eating. Wow... it was really fantastic. The grilled beef was tender and juicy. Enjoyed each small bite of it. Ambience was more of American pub style. 2 rows of individual tables with one long dining bench in between. Playing were American old songs. You can also see the chefs busy preparing the food in the kitchen.Waiters were prompt responding to the needs of patrons. The outlet do not have a washroom. You need to walk, cross a road about 12 metres out of the restaurant to an unisex one. There's a table outside the restaurant for smokers. My humble opinion, the sounding of frogs and toads at night made it unpleasant should you be sitting outside. Remember to choose to sit inside for a better experience
5
Holiday dining deal with children at Roadhouse is fantastic! Hope they will have it again in Jun ! The burgers we had were very nicely done, my kid wolfed it all down without prompting from me (not usually the case...).? Mine was nicely seared yet still juicy. Kid's milkshake & sundae were slurped up as well
4
If you love burgers and want to build your own then this is the place to go. They let you have one spin of the wheel when you are ordering and you win where it lands. One spin per table. We won a cocktail.
4
Great burgers and chips. The foie gras version looked to standout. Dessert enjoyable and the atmosphere gets you into the burger mood. Would like to return.
4
Roadhouse serves up a great burger with lots of interesting toppings. The BYOB is our favorite and the fries are seriously good.
5
Good food and great service! Went there for a meal with my friends, total bill came up to around $20+ per pax, nice ambience. It's a little hard to find given that it is tucked in one corner
3
Place gets livelier after 8pm. Coleslaw was good. Burger buns nice and soft, patty is meh. It was an average meal
1
This staff A brought us the wrong burgers 4 times.The first 2 came out, and even when we told him (staff A) it wasn't ours, and asked him to bring it back to the kitchen to check, he kept insisting it was correct. They finally agreed to go back to the kitchen and check, so they left the first 2 burgers at the table, and another staff (staff B) insisted at least 1 was correct, even though the patty was deep fried when it was supposed to be their wagyu. So, my friend poked a hole in the patty to see if they had deep fried their wagyu patty, and was all ready to eat.Afterwards, we saw our food being brought to another table, because they looked equally confused and was asking the same guy the same things. We tried telling the staff that they mixed up our burgers, but they were insistent it was correct. When they finally realised that they DID mix up our orders, they just brought the burger that was our table directly to the other table, and theirs to ours!!!! Even with the hole in the patty!! When our next 2 burgers came, staff A also insisted one was the mushroom one, when it clearly didn't have A SINGLE MUSHROOM in it, while the other was something else. We kept telling him that wasn't right, but he, again, kept insisting that it was. This went on for a long time, and we only got all our food more than 45 minutes into the dinner. There were only 5 of us, and about 4 different small groups in the restaurant.When I could finally eat my burger, I took a bite, and bit straight into slimy beef. Staff B told us it'll all be done medium rare, but I had a bite of RAW MINCED BEEF. My 2 other friends had raw beef as well, and one more of my friends' burger was COLD to touch. They kept mixing up our orders, even our side dishes were all wrong!Incredibly lousy service. Really disappointed with the staff and food
4
We went there for brunch on Saturday. We ordered the Huevos Rancheros, signature breakfast, breakfast burger and a build-your-own-burger. The wait for the food wasn't very long and it was very tasty! The burgers were well-seasoned and the truffle fries smelled divine. The huevos rancheros was not overly spicy and also very well-seasoned. The service staff was very attentive as well and came around to check on whether the food was satisfactory which we really appreciated.We were the only ones at around 11.30 am and the crowd only came in around 12 pm plus. Even with a crowd, the atmosphere was still great. The only thing which wasn't great was the location of the place and the lack of signage. The restaurant is located in the corner beside a whole row of wooden furniture shops and without a proper signage out front, we drove around for 5 minutes before I called the reservation hotline who kindly directed me there. Overall, it's a really nice place for friends to gather.
4
Ate at the Roashouse last night. The burger I ordered was great. The truffle fries and macaroni and cheese too. Was a bit disappointed with the onion rings. They had a lot more batter on them than I'd like. That's the only reason I've rated them a 4 instead of 5. Service was great. Staff were really friendly and took time explaining things. Will be back soon
4
Decided to bring my folk there for dinner cause I was craving a good burger and wanted them to try something new. Let me just say, after all this time, damn!! The burgers are still ace!! Yeah and they changed their menu, got some new stuff. Gotta try their pulled pork pasta! The clam chowder is quite good as well! So anytime you're in orchard, craving for a good burger at a decent price, gotta pop by! To play safe make a reservation to avoid disappointment
3
Average burger for the price but really found it hard to find the restaurant which is tucked away at the very end of the row of shop houses. Had limited space and unisex washrooms are outside the shop in a shack. Only thing we liked was that they had children's books available which my daughter loved. Service was also good
5
Love the food and the atmosphere. Not too crowded, neither was it noisy. The burger was great with the medium well beef. Awesome cheese cake too!
3
The burger and aglio olio was good value and yummy. The ribs and sandwich was't great.
It's more a day venue, wasn't too busy that night, and they close fairly early.
4
I visited earlier this year with a craving for a good burger. All in all it was ok but I never felt that it was a blow away burger. Typically for this area it's all over priced for what it is.
4
The burger is nicely prepared with juicy patty and yummy melted cheese. Chips were great too. I like it that the portion is not too huge but just enough to feel full. Will be back again to make/design my own burger !
5
Had the Juicy Lucy and the Hot Mama, was left thoroughly impressed with the wagyu patties and the onion rings :) a definite thumbs up for this place!
4
Great ambience, and food. Just not too suitable for groups. It was difficult to chat over the long table. Food could be better - less salty fries.
3
Burgers are their specialty and they know how to make them. The burgers are really awesome.
the place in itself is small but a nice ambiance welcomes you. The location (Dempsey Hill) is a great one.
Good for a burger brunch.
4
The only reason I didn't rate it "excellent" because after all, it's just a burger, right? We enjoyed them on an October Saturday night. Place was not overly crowded, and the staff was attentive and very friendly. For Singapore, we thought the prices to be reasonable. Fries were great as were the onion rings. (We like Fat Boy burgers too, but don't like the oregano, etc. on their onion rings. These were simple and tasty!) And the Dempsey Hill atmosphere is a plus. We will definitely go back to this place
3
Ordered starter chicken wings, garden green followed by Hot mama and another was customize. The meat patty as usual was grilled to perfection and no complains about it. Hot mama is my all time favorite and totally will recommend to another who enjoys the taste of fresh jalapeÃ±o! The starters:Chicken wings ( hot) : ordered the least spicy as my partner isn't able to take it too hot. The taste was good and the potion was just nice for small ( 3 wings, 2 drumlets)The garden salad though was very disappointing, obviously can't expect too much since it's just salad, however the pricing of the salad at $14 is abit overprice since very little avocado was used. The service is good too but earlier there was something that too me wasn't very professional. I signaled to the service staff for a refill of water, and caught the attention of a Caucasian woman whom obviously was the manager or supervisor there. My table is 3 feet away, yet instead of coming over to do a refill, she rather walk 3 feet towards the opposite direction to get a waiter to serve... Hmmm.. Golden hands or .. ?Anyway, definitely a recommended place for burger lovers and the prefect for kids too

Ate lunch here on a Saturday afternoon a few weeks ago with my wife and kids (14 & 9). We are U.S. expats living in Singapore for about a year-and-a-half so far. This was our first visit to Roadhouse; we wish that he had found this restaurant sooner! The fare is what I would call "typical" American comfort food. Burgers, hot dogs, ribs, cheese steaks, onion rings, fries (chips), etc. This particular Saturday we were looking for a taste of home and we found it at Roadhouse. The restaurant even catered to our son's food allergies (he is allergic to egg, dairy and nuts) by preparing a slab of BBQ ribs and grilled corn on the cob prepared without his allergens. We also ordered the "Prawn Star" and "Breakfast of Champions" burgers and a Pulled Pork sandwich; these three all came with a side of fries. None of us left hungry or unhappy. Wait staff was attentive and friendly. Will definitely come back to Roadhouse

good food and good service.

Probably one of the best gourmet burgers in town. Service staff were friendly and efficient. Kids friendly place.

Great location for a hearty burger fix! Can be tricky to find for the first time as it's off the standard Dempsey Hill trail.
Awesome chicken wings to start, if you can handle the heat, friendly staff and plenty of parking right outside the door.

An establishment under the prive group .Pretty decent burgers and milk shake , with a nice ambience.

The huge patty and the truffle fries which go with it make it a calorie bomb, but I was hungry just a few hours after my meal there. The sign of a great and "just-right" meal. Perfectly cooked Wagyu patty makes it one of the best I've eaten in Singapore

Been to Roadhouse twice within a month, once with a friend, another with my family. Staff were responsiive and food was really good. The kids set meals portions are a little huge for my 5 and 6 year olds (esp when desserts are served) so parents with tods might want to take note

I saw glowing reviews before going, which was the main reason i decided to make a reservation there among all the other illustrious places at Dempsey. Sadly, my experience was a far cry from the expectation. The food was hit-and-miss (the burger meat was decent quality but the overall burger was too small, had too little ingredients and was overpriced, the fries were pretty good but the coleslaw was downright weird, the onion rings and fried cheesecake were acceptable but not worth the price), the service was polite but inefficient and forgetful, and the interior design was boring.Sorry, but it simply isn't worth its prices

i visited this restaurant on Sunday for lunch. firstly they don't take bookings for less than 6 people. when we arrived, there was plenty of tables available, but we were given table squished between two other families.our next table family, were approaching dessert ( suppose they were done with mains) and the man from the family was putting the plates away while a service staff was standing right behind him. staff just kept on watching.it took the staff 15 mins to come back to us to take our orders.( only after i inquired if this was elf- service restaurant)apart from this, our overall experience was good. the staff who served us was pleasant, the beef burger was excellent ( according to my son) most flavorful- he had bacon marinated burger. the bun used for burger was soft and tasty as well.i tried 1001 fries- which was very very thin fries deep fried- crunchy.worth going back again despite poor service

Roadhouse is your typical American diner in their decor. On their right wall is a large mural of typical 60s icons. Luckily the food portions were not american sized and were comfortable for the average person. It is pretty noisy so you shouldn't be having a romantic meal here.The highlights are definitely the burgers which use wagyu beef patty and are delicious.The Prawn Star burger and the Cheesy Tuna Melt sandwich also had a thumbs up from my colleagues. However the Eggs Benedict and Chicken & Mushroom Spaghetti Aglio Olio were reported to be average. We also tried the Deep Fried Cheesecake which was an different take on the usual fried ice-cream. Well it's something different, but I think cheesecake lovers will not really like it.Would be better priced probably 20% cheaper to be a regular goto place for burgers

Nice little place in Dempsey for a good burger. Nice bun, good fries, and the patty was nicely cooked. All around decent burger.Also a bonus, good value for kids meal. The kids burger meal was nice, and included a nice DIY sundae that our daughter enjoyed. 
4
Really liked the burgers here, we were hanging out on Dempsey hill and needed something to eat, we did take away burgers and hung out at the rugby fields. Burgers were great, service was fast for take away.
3
We built our own burgers and they were very delicious. However, the service was bad. It almost seemed like the staff lacked instruction on what their job was supposed to be and it took forever for them bring drinks and the check.
5
Roadhouse delivers with its delicious gourmet burgers that come with fries and truffle mayo. Their burgers are made to perfection and their truffle fries is probably one of the best around. Come on Tuesday for free flow of truffle fries!
4
A really great burger, but the cheesy chilli fries are so good. My go to comfort food! :-) very friendly staff too make this a pretty good relaxing and casual place to eat.

location - dempseypremise - dim and inviting, makes people want to stay longer. it was nicely laid out as well so the space was not too crampedstaff - friendly and accommodating. helpful and polite. i like this alot! :)crowd - friends / clients / couples / family. 1st time i went to a resto where it had all the mix of patrons! very nice and easy crowd! good for laughs as well! :)food - can be better to be honest. pricing can be lower as well based on their portions. the burger was good but not so when it comes to the ribs, have tasted better ones for sure.verdict - will be here again but not so soon, main attraction being free parking and also good atmosphere. (mind you, last i was here was 2 years ago!

Have not been for about a year but the Bacon & Gorgonzola Wagyu Burger was fab & came perfectly "medium" as ordered. All told we spent about $35.00 a head with juice & milkshakes (no alcohol) & truffle fries. Service was quick & iced water topped up constantly which is a miracle these days in most restaurants! The Michael Jackson music seemed old school but suited the ambience As we gazed out the bug glass window at the Dempsey greenery outside. Will be back soon

If you like burgers, this is the place to go to! Had the pork pulled burger which was more than great! In for a real challenge? Pick up the terminator challenge and get on the wall of fame if you succeed to finish this huge meal within 20min. Another feature of this restaurant is BOYB (built your own burger). Sky is the limit!
4
Service was very prompt, courteous and efficient. burgers were very good, but fries were a tad hard and dry. I also ordered the BBQ Chix Sandwich and since the kitchen had run out of Ciabatta, it was replaced by wholemeal bread which was over toasted and burnt all along the sides, making it hard and unpalatable. I regretted orfering the chix sandwich!
4
The foie gras burger is great! Although the foie gras was firmer than expected. Wagyu beef patty was juicy and tasty. Wished the burger size was abit bigger. Truffle fries were also great, although there were some fries that weren't as truffle-y flavoured as the rest. Good decor, lively ambience for couples and families alike

Chanced upon this cafe on the internet and my interest perked up when I saw predominantly positive reviews.Went there for dinner and ordered the Bacon Marinated Burger ... it was a treat ... perfectly done really juicy burger with bacon.This review wold not be complete if I did not comment on the service ... very, very good.If you like burgers, this place is a must visit. You will end up going back to it

Went over with 10 pax and the food came quite on time. And food was good. Was shock by the size of onion ring but it's good!!!
Burger was good too.

Poor service, food was bad.
Do not deserve to charge "Service Charge" at all!
Seriously..waste $$$$$

Dropped into the Roadhouse when we were in Dempsey Hill as our oldest (4.5yrs) decided that he had to have a burger for lunch! We certainly weren't disappointed with the burgers on offer.The restaurant is child friendly with books on offer for the kids and a very reasonable kids menu offering a main, drink and desert for $12++. The kids cheeseburger was perfectly done and my sone made short shrift of it.For the adults there are loads of burgers on offer but a fantastic ability to completely build your own burger. This was a great idea and ensured that my wife and I could have what exactly what we wanted. The burgers were cooked perfectly and were very, very good. The fries were also perfectly cooked and great tasting.Overall a great burger joint and we will certainly be back... Next time I might even give the Terminator challenge a go!

I recently took the terminator challenge, although I didn't complete it, it was certainly exciting and innovative. My only qualm was that the beef was a little tough, which slowed me down tremendously. Note to all who are game enough to try, it's much bigger than the pictures online.My Friends and I enjoyed ourselves tremendously, the atmosphere coupled with the food made it a memorable occasion.

Went on a Tuesday evening as they had a promotion going for free flow of fries (drizzled with truffle oil). So once we had made our burger orders we dug into those fries. The fired wee not too bad. The burgers though were perfect. The beef patty was done exactly like I had asked. Loved it.The only problem for me in the entire experience was the 20+ min waiting time
5
We love the roadhouse as the menu adheres to our 3 boys tastes. Every time we have visited we receive great food and service in a relaxed atmosphere. Our boys favourite part is the ice cream sundae, which comes out on a tray with several small pot of toppings so you can 'make your own' (mini marshmallows, chocolate sauce, strawberry sauce etc) what a great and fun idea for the ids

Ok here we go.....been there today with my family. Great burger with nice wagyu beef patty super juicy and perfect toppings. Suggest their xmas burger that was amazing with a mix of some sweet touches from the cranbery jam was surprisingly perfect. The truffle fies were cooked to perfection and the service was very good as welll. The only "problem" i had was with the overall acoustics of the place which was really bad so the noise of just people normally talking was really bad and they insisted in putting also some music which we couldnt listen so it just added tonthe noise. Once we were done eating we rushed to get the bill and be out of there. Management should really work on this as it is fixable and honestly why play music if one cant hear it anyway just adding to the overall noise. Will sure be back but maybe take a panadol with me next time.

I ate at Roadhouse with a friend yesterday. We both had burgers and as part of the lunch set I had the mushroom nachos, which were described as coming with cheddar cheese. When the dish arrived it was mushrooms drowning in a cheap cheese sauce. It certainly wasn't cheddar. While the burgers were good the nachos weren't. We didn't finish the dish and it was an appetizer. Frankly, it should be taken off the menu
4
Great place to go for burgers. The burgers are delicious and comes with coleslaw and fries. Prices for burgers are around $24. The price of the milkshake at $12 is too steep though.The service is good too. The only problem is that it is a family restaurant so if you go early you have to contend with young children who smash blocks on the table and being cajoled by their mothers to eat their mac and cheese
4
Good meal and good service even if it is a little pricey. The location is a little out of the way if you're a tourist but is worth it if you have a craving for a good burger. I had the bacon marinated burger and it was awesome
4
Real value for money here where the fish tacos are concerned. Only $13 for two tacos. Watch out though, because you never know how spicy they will be!
2
Burger's good but food services are slow. Furthermore we're the earliest guest here yet they could make a mistake by forgetting orders
3
Had the Plain Jane burger, cooked perfectly (medium), sans ketchup. Onion would've been nice. Flavorful, juicy. Sara had the BLT salad, with beautiful sliced avocados on top. Service was excellent, although tabletop was a little sticky. Thoughtful touch: every table has packaged wet cloths for customer use

This is a little treat in Dempsey if you are looking for some comfort food. We went for saturday breakfast and the restaurant was quite quiet. For the first part, the staff were incredible. We have an energetic toddler and immediately a colouring book and crayons were delivered to our table as soon as we were sat down. The waiter was new but told us immediately and was just honest when he didnt know something and had to check - fine by us. We have the breakfast burrito, coffees and a chocolate milkshake. The milkshake was other worldly. Proper thick creamy chocolate milkshake. dreamy. The burritos were delicious, but what was unexpected was the rocket and mango salsa side salad that came with it. Knock your socks off. We had a great experience and saw some other dishes on our neighbours tables that looked really good too - fries, mac n cheese and a burger that looked juicy and huge! coming back soon

Roadhouse is relaxed, casual, buzzy and could be kinda hip. The food's okay, the service matches it, this isn't fine dining, but it's not a diner either. Families, large groups, teens out to impress on limited funds all seem to converge here and happily co-exist.The odd thing is that Roadhouse is in leafy, atmospheric, laid back, lush, foresty Dempsey. While other restaurants feel airy, colonial, set back into the hills and very much 'outdoorsy' - Roadhouse has a patio that overlooks the carpark, a window that looks right out on to a wall and an interior that could be lifted from everywhere.It's not awful, it just has the wrong vibe. Stick it in the city and it's a wow, put it here and it's a why

I was given a seat outside. Place was terribly crowded, which was a good sign. However, this also placed some strains on their ability to deliver fast service. To their credit, the servers did warn us it would take a while. They also own Hacienda's accross the road, and this was convenient for them to use that space for the spill over crowd

I have spent my life in search of the best burgers in the world. In Singapore the most consistent American restaurant is the chain Chilis, but RoadHouse at Dempsey has the best burger, in my opinion. If you are a frat boy meat head who is up for the challenge, they also offer a "eat a kilogram of beef and you get the burger for free" deal. They not only put your face up on a Wall of Fame, but on little standees that populate the tables, so future diners can easily marvel at your prowess, which I though was a nice touch. One draw back is that when we were there the service was slower than a relay team made up of a sloth, a snail, a tortoise, and a glacier to run the anchor leg. On top of that the European manager lady has a face on her like she is literally upset that you have chosen to have lunch at her place - she scolded waiters in front of us, and if this burger wasn't so legendary she might have put me off returning there

Went here on a Thursday night and the place was mostly empty. Ordered a Wagyu burger ($22), a cajun chicken salad ($13) a plate of fries ($6) and a bier ($11). Food was very good but burger took very long to come out, about 15 minutes later then the rest of the food. Weird, in an almost empty place. Enjoyed the food though but felt that $61 is way overpriced. May come again but not sure

Wanted to try here after a magazine review.Very disappointed.Partner's meal served in 10 minutes then anone order for eggs rancheros took another 35 minutes!Rancheros were a mess - runny eggs, one chopped pork sausage and salsa bean dip.Apology but no explanation given for the delay.I did notice lots of averted looks from the waiter.Desert was described as a "Cranberry Nut Brownie'.It was a square of chocolate slab cake covered in Hershey syrup with a sprinkle of walnuts. Vanilla ice cream scoop on top. The ice cream was nice!Food :basic diner fare at high prices. We won't be back and cannot recommend Road House at Block 13 Dempsey - Tanglin Village.The main reasons are the prices and the dreadful service

Thought we try "ROADHOUSE" again at Dempsey Hills. We ordered Call 955 Wings, Plain Jane burger without Cheese- though it was plated with cheese, chicken rocket salad, half baby back ribs, kids mac & cheese. Service is rated bad here because the ribs came first after the drinks. We did not want the Dad to sit and wait for us, so we let him start AND he finished his ribs before the salad and the burgers came. And then way after that the super hot wings arrived. The ribs were tender but small for the price. The salad was tiny as a meal. (Better off going to the Grand Hyatt and getting the real deal for just a few dollar more). We ordered free flowing fries, but we had to ask twice to get a refill. Very disappointed
