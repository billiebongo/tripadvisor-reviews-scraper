Had lunch with work friends. The food was ok and portion sizes were small. The main plus point is the location overlooking Boat Quay.

For me, it was beyond expectations. I was thinking that it wont be that good. But it turned out to be awesome. Very good taste, nice riverfront seating, promo service and ambiance. Good for Indian food.

Food is great. If you are looking for good Indian food this is the place to be. If you looking for a fancy restaurant; not this place. Little expensive though.

Perhaps a little more expansive than the other ones, but still very affordable. Efficient service. Good choice in the menu. You can modulate the degree of spice of yout plate. The waiters are of good advice.

This fairly small restaurant served some incredible dishes, far beyond expectations. It was served outside on a balmy evening, overlooking the Singapore River at Boat Quay, and was delicious, meat well cooked, and ample portions. Though not cheap, the price was reasonable, with the customary 6% service charge added in, as a matter of course in Singapore, it seems

My wife & I ate at Royal Bengal on our first night in Singapore. The food was served promptly, and was very tasty! We shared chicken pakoras for starters & I had lamb jalfezi fir main & my wife had chicken tikka masala. We shared Methi Potatoes & Pilau rice washed down with Tiger Beer, which was a reasonable price as it was Happy Hour! The dishes were authentic although the jalfrezi probably not as spicy as we'd have in the UK, Methi potato was enjoyable as it's not that often I find that on UK menus.

I needed to find somewhere to eat near the waterfront before heading over to the evening's light show. Royal Bengal is OK, but nothing special. I had a tandoor paneer tikka appetizer (far too much food for an appetizer), goan shrimp curry (which was OK), vegetable pulao, mango lassi and lime juice. I ate outside near the water, which was a nice setting, but the Wi-Fi didn't work out there. If I went back to Singapore, I would do my research and eat somewhere better than this

The worst meal we've ever had in Singapore, curry house classics loaded with oil, ketchup and sugar, served at tepid temperatures after sitting around for hours if not days-- the worst kind of muddled steam-table fare, but at riverside prices. This is a place for masochists

Firstly this is the only Indian restaurant I've been to in Singapore that serves mango chutney with the popadoms - great for me! The butter chicken was delicious - lots of breast meat and lovely creamy sauce. The aloo gobi was great too and the naan breads were beautifully light and fluffy. A great place for Indian food

We had wandered down Boat Quay watching the Dragon Boat races which were part of the Singapore River Festival. Royal Bengal gave us the opportunity to watch whilst having lunch. The Samosa and the Subji Pakoras were superb and reminded us of previous visits to India
