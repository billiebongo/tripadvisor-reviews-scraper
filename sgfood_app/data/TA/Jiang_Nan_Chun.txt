Was led to our table promptly on arrival. Server recommended us really good dim sum and doesn't push for us to over-order, even though we eventually realised that we didn't order enough food.
5
Food quality is excellent. The service is even superb. The ambience is excellent too. Worth recommending.

We eat dinner here yesterday. The crispy aromatic duck to start, then a scallop main for me and a cod one for my wife. All were excellent. Very attentive service too.

Very spacious and nicely laid out restaurant. Mixture of Cantonese classics and modern Chinese favourites. Staff friendly and attentive. Pleasant evening.

We ordered a set dinner during CNY. We were highly impressed by the excellent attentIve and professional table service provided by all the staff. (Oh well, if someone could pop by to check with us how the meal went... that would be even better :-). We were surrounded by two other tables who had significantly greater interaction with the managers - I could tell that they handled the customers very well. Tables were quite well spaced apart; lighting was just nice. We enjoyed all the food (next time I must try their ala carte menu). If there’s any food memorable, I must say the fried prawns on rice crackers, steamed cod, and double-boiled soup were superb

This is a fine dining establishment that deserves a Michelin star. The cuisine is Chinese with a mix of regional styles including Beijing/Northern as well as Cantonese. It is, frankly, head and shoulders above Pu Tien which actually has a Michelin star and it is easily the best meal I have had in Singapore over two weeks of holidaying.The Peking duck is sublime and the skin was crisp and flavourful. I applaud the attempt to add a caviar twist to the traditional pancake recipe of sauce, spring onion and cucumber but unfortunately the caviar they used was not very good quality and came across as salty mush. As it was an optional ingredient and not a replacement for the other sauces, we just left ours untouched. Their famous soups have an umami broth consistent with the quality ingredients and Chinese herbs they use. The oxtail was so tender you could almost spread it on a cracker with a butter knife. They even manage to make spinach, a vegetable generally famous only for its association with a bemuscled cartoon, a culinary delight. Try out the new almond cream dessert. An egg white variant on the more traditional starch based recipe, this was lighter and creamier than I thought possible.The wine list was actually quite good although by-the-glass options were limited. If you are into off dry wines, you are out of luck. Even the German Riesling on offer was a tad tart. Although one of the Maitre’d, a young and extremely knowledgable fellow named Alex, dug out a 2004 Pegasus Bay Riesling that was tastier and richer than most Sauternes.In case anyone from the Four Seasons or Jiang Nan Chun is reading this, I would recommend considering Alex for bigger and better things. He was very well informed and personable and offset an otherwise inattentive waiter who failed to look after us despite the restaurant being half empty that night.FYI, unless you know you will need to clean your hands mid meal, I would strongly recommend sending away the warm hand towels. It is a nice gesture but the lemon scent they dunk the towels in was so overpowering that at points I thought someone was spraying air freshener at our table. It actually interfered with our ability to taste and smell some of our food and wine.The restaurant itself is well appointed in a faux Qin dynasty facade with big comfy leather chairs. There is no music and unlike most Chinese restaurants, the clientele are quite reserved so that a nice conversation can be had. Good for business as well as romance or friends. Dinner for two including a whole Peking duck, other dishes, dessert and wine was about $370 but we rounded up to $400 just because it was such a lovely meal. Would go back

The Four Seasons is a beautiful hotel and as you would expect the F&B outlets there are all of a very good standard. This is high end Chinese dining, very good Cantonese food, impeccable service, lovely dining room (though quite empty on our visit). The chef is new, he’s from HK, but most recently was working in Macau in charge of a 1* Michelin restaurant. However I’m giving this a 4* review, not 5, as I felt that some of the dishes we had lacked a bit of flavour. They were delicate and well prepared but could have done with a little more depth.

Four Seasons hotels are undoubtably one of the most exclusive luxury hotel labels in our era. So are their food offerings for clients with a demanding palate. For a business luncheon or indulgent dinner with real saveurs of Chinese cuisine in Singapore, even you are not in the Orchard area, just grab a cab for Jiang Nan Chun - Spring of southern Yangtze - you will enjoy a journey of authentic Chinese culinary art. Here, the you-can-find-everywhere Cantonese dim sum are ordered per piece and steamed upon order. You will not therefore be eating over-cooked dumplings. You will change your idea of dim sum because the fillings here are minced chicken thighs, prawns, scallops, chives, corianders... not smashed meat mixture. Besides dim sum, the menu features classic yet very refined Chinese dishes including live stock from seas, free range poultry and premium air-flown meat. Do not miss out the spicy dumplings (probably the best of the world) and Taiwanese 3-cup chicken in clay pot (the best besides Taiwan). Finally, the gastronomy is about experiences of our 5 senses. What can you say when you are treated by highly qualified and caring staff, while being seated in a exquisite decor with bird cages (yes, quite Chinese cliché, but...). These cages are now merely lamp shades on the ceiling. And birds? They are all made in celadon ceramic, twittering at the entrance of the restaurant for humming you the tunes of the Spring. No question of "value for money", it's a pure enjoyment.

Jiang - Nan ChunIt's one of our favourite Chinese Restaurants in Singapore.It's the second time we visit since the restaurant have been renovated.The menu had changed a bit with some of the popular dishes not being there any more.We are relieved that the Wasabi Prawns are still available Which is our favourite, the B B Q duck we had is one of high light and pork ribs are a bit dry.We had a enjoyable night
5
We ordered several dishes as recommended and all of them were great. The Peking duck was carved with expertise from the chef and it wasn't oily as some restaurants do, resulting in a crispy texture. The caviar was also a nice complement to it. Another dish that was outstanding was the oxtail in claypot which was tender and flavourful. The service was superb and flawless. As usual, the team delivered an outstanding service
5
Hosted my wedding dinner at the Four Seasons Hotel.
In addition to the flawless service rendered all round, the quality of the food prepared by Jiang-Nan Chun was excellent.
5
Amazing food and excellent service. Last order was at 2 but they kept the place open as we reached late.
The food was different from your standard Chinese fare - extremely flavorful and tasty.
I highly recommend it.

Came here for CNY dinner with business associates and the food and service was great, although server was a little too keen to clear our plates! Overall, the experience was very nice and the quality of food is superb.
4
Nice ambience and excellent service. Menu is more limited than j expected and of course it is expensive. But it is good and I would go back
5
Great food!
Nice Atmosphere.
Loved the dim sums!
Awesome service and the staff were friendly as well! KUDOS to the service!

That dinner was a BD treatment from my husband, but he didn't mention it at all upon his having made a booking. It's still fine for us to celebrate with ourselves only.All staff politely attended our table and gave us a certain distance also during the dinner, which was very appreciated. All dishes were very tasty and we couldn't reach even dessert because we had been full by the dessert. So, we laughed to each other because no dessert even it's supposed to be a BD dinner. Well, anyway, since we toasted with champagne and all dishes satisfied us very much, we decided to head to the payment. Then, miracle got happened!! Service staff came to our table with a beautiful BD cake and their handmade BD card!! We completely didn't expect it at all. I got goose bumps because of this hospitality. No idea how they got known since we stayed at the different hotel and have never stayed at FS. However, their warm hearts created this miracle. Thanks for ur time to arrange for celebrating my BD!!

Don't get me wrong. The dim sums are well made and the ambience is good. But to pay good money for just the ambience and food where u can get in a less pricey restaurant doesn't make much sense to me to be honest. I think its an asian thing where u downsize the portion of food, decorate with some flowers and call that high end fine dining.

Jiang-Nan Chun has received some fantastic reviews, but quite frankly, they're misleading. While the service is outstanding, staff are lovely, informed and attentive, and the setting is fitting for a high-end restaurant, the food itself lacked character and any real depth of flavour. Quite frankly, our warm towels at the end of the meal had more fragrance than the 'chefs specialty' Oxtail in Lemongrass oil clay pot. When we go there we deliberated over the menu and finally ordered several things. For entree we took fried eggplant in chicken floss, overly sweet with no cut through; black bean beef in puff pastry, which reminded us of a meat pie back in Aus; and steamed prawn and crab dumplings, fine but unremarkable. For mains we shared the aforementioned oxtail in lemongrass oil claypot, the lemongrass was barely noticeable, and the whole dish was swimming in a gravox style gravy; and the honey glazed, slow cooked pork belly, a staple in the region but no different from what you could get at a hawker store. After each of these dishes we were hoping that the next dish was the thing, but alas, it never delivered. Fundamentally, while the price tag was fine for a high-end restaurant, in the real world I'd pay less than half for the quality we got. Not a repeat visit.

Had dinner last night at this Chinese restaurant and was Wow by the quality of food and services. Ambience was classy and privacy was definitely valued. That said, the team at Jiang Nan Chun were never too far away and was observant to the needs of the guests.Food was superb and dishes served was beautiful as much as delicious. Desserts were filled with surprises and a great way to end the meal. Star of the night was definitely their signature Roast Duck. It is a must have in the restaurant. Pictures submitted says it al

Was here for the dim sum and lunch. Food is good. Dim sum comes in per piece basis which is good instead of the usual in 3. Price range from $3 up each. Had this great soup of fish maw and black garlic, taste is light but good. Had a few dim sum items including the wagyu bun. Reasonable good dim sum in a 5-star setting with attentive staff. If you want a treat for friends and family and don't mind the price, good place to be having your dim sum and lunch with nice ambience
4
Good impression with this restaurant. Great menu with lots of choices. I like the steamed fish which was very fresh and tasty.
5
perfect in every detail. elegant restaurant with good food. the service was great, just as you would expect it.
4
What I appreciated was that they took note of some feedback and did something about it. A pleasant restaurant with a good variety of dishes and good service.
5
We agree with the Pekín Duck. It melts in your mouth. Unfortunately the portion is not enough for 2 people. If you are staying close to the Orchard area try this Chinese restaurant. You will not be disappointed
5
Our group had a set lunch comprising several courses and each was exquisitely presented. The dishes were all very good but my favourite was the fried rice.
5
Have not been to this restaurant for quite a while so was pleasantly surprised to see the newly renovated restaurant. Very cosy and ideal for entertaining.
We had the business set lunch and it was very good! Just the right amount. Service was also good.
5
Was there with a friend for dinner. Ordered the set dinner for 2. Nice restaurant, ambience and great service. Ordered the salted egg skin fish and pork belly before the main set meal. In all, food is delicious and the staff service is professional.Recommended for family gathering particular for CNY as well as business lunch or dinner.Dr E. Cho

This restaurant was highly recommended to us while visiting Singapore. We made reservations one night and enjoyed a very good meal. In addition to the traditional Chinese menu, this restaurant offers a fusion on Chinese and Singaporean fare. The flavors were excellent and new, with a good selection of wines and cocktails. I would definitely recommend it

It has been years since I visited mainly because it is not quite near to anything I usually go to. But a friend wanted to eat Peking Duck and I thought it would be a nice change from my usual eateries. I have always liked the ambience of the Four Seasons as stepping inside is always so soothing. We had the Alaskan crab salad, a fish soup with chinese pear, duck done two ways, kalian with mixed waxed meat and Ee fu noodles.I personally loved the fish soup with its subtle character and hint of sweetness. But then, as my friend said, its my Cantonese upbringing – must have soup. The Alaskan crab was a little disappointing but I guess there is not much you can do with par frozen week old meat. But the duck was a surprise. Normally, I do not have or rate Peking duck in Singapore. This is because a good Peking duck dish essentially requires three good ingredients: a 65 day old duck with just the right amount of fat below the skin; steamed pancakes with the right elasticity; and an aromatic sweet sour hoisin sauce made within the last 24 hours to provide the ‘earth’ taste. Traditionally the Emperor’s used a black feathered Nanjing duck that ranged free (muscle buildup) then force feed for 20 days (fat buildup). Now I know the duck we had was not from Nanjing and it may or may not have been 65 days old, but the skin melted in the lips and the hoisin sauce was definitely made that day with its alternative waves of sweet and sour cutting through the fat. I suspect the waxed meat was a mistake given the richness of the duck but still very pleasant. All in all very worth going.But remember to make a reservation and order the duck first to avoid disappointment

The restaurant at Four Seasons Hotel in Orchard is said to be renovated and advertises to be embodying the concept of Chinese principles of enjoyment and happiness, which implies that the food (and the way you eat it) has the ability to transcend the aspirations of the mind and soul. I somewhat tend to agree and endorse these principles after a round of dining at this restaurant. Ours was a business dinner with a group in a private setting and with a set menu. The soberness of the business discussions, somewhat mellowed by the sumptuousness of the food gave an all-round fullness to the event. The food, included, among others, Drunken Chicken with fermented cabbage, steamed rice noodle with fresh prawns in egg white and Chinese wine broth, which were magnificent. The dessert of deep-fried flaky pastry with papaya custard was a superb way of rounding off the dinner. The service was impeccable and the ambiance regal.A highly recommended restaurant for a formal business or informal family get-together
4
Tried out the dimsum which was recommended. took a while for food to be served. We ordered dimsum and the dishes.
4
We had a meeting over dinner here one of the week nights.The interior decor is strikingly luxuriant and very comfortable.Service is impeccable, polite, attentive and friendly without being intrusive. Plates are changed after each course, drinks refilled without prompting, as one would expect at a Four Season’s establishment. Each diner has two sets of chop-sticks and a spoon, one set for personal use, the other in case you wish to pass food to someone without using your used chopsticks! Attention to minor details such as this creates a favorable impression.The food we had their signature Jiang-Nan Chun Peking Duck which was served with both, normal flour and spring onion wraps; sugar, sliced cucumber and onion shoots, plumb sauce and black caviar. The skin was crispy and devoid of fat, and the caviar contributed a slightly saltish taste to each bite.We definitely come here again.
5
Really top notch service and the tableside carving of the house specialty of Peeking Duck was very impressive. Overall a good experience. Only one small criticism, there was a well publicized promotion of a discount (25%) for the peeking duck, end of the meal bill came along with no discount given , which was immediately rectified when we queried the charge - a genuine error or perhaps not ??In any event a pricey but overall great experience will come back
5
Having been to countless Chinese restaurants all over, the food at Jiang-Nan Chun was just top notch. The ingredients were very fresh and of top quality while also cooked to perfection. I especially enjoyed the roasted suckling pig with a perfectly crispy skin and succulent meat. Would definitely return when I am next visiting Singapore
5
Out of 4 days, we chose to eat here - and we would come back all over again. The dumplings were incredible, the fish and the veggies delicious, finely prepared and beautifully presented. The staff is incredibly hospitable and resourceful, even remembered our preferences from the previous night.

Ridiculous minuscule main course portions at exorbitant pricesImagine ordering a fish main course and a thin female child of 11 is still hungry afterwards.It is not acceptable that restaurants steal my good hard earned $$$$ serving tiny portions that force diners to buy more dishes. Particularly if one is eating fish and not meat. There should be a standard weight of flesh provided at least 250 grams per plateAs fish is less filling than meatWhy should we be forced to reorder more dishes because at $38 a dish we get about 120 grams of fish on a plateThis is a disgrace We ordered 3 fish dishes and all of them were smaller than entree sizes I have eaten all over the world it was NOT a degustation menuSo we were not eating 8 small tasting dishes it was a la carteThe chef should be fired.We were staying in house so it was convenient for us to dine here. We know Singapore is no longer a tourist destination and we know that this is supposed to be one of the best Chinese Cantonese dining venues in the city. But it is not acceptable No matter how glamorous nor how tasty the sauces are nor famous the COD FISH DISH IS. To serve servings so small that Diners are hungry afterwardsA disgrace Bye bye Singapore what a rip off

Jiang-Nan Chun Restaurant is located on the second floor of the Four Seasons Hotel, Singapore, and has recently been renovated. There are 4 private dining rooms with a seating capacity between 4 to 8 persons and the general indoor seating for 78 people. The interior decor is strikingly luxuriant apparently inspired by the beautiful architecture of the paradise-like Jiang-Nan region.Service is impeccable, polite, attentive and friendly without being intrusive. Plates are changed after each course, drinks refilled without prompting, as one would expect at a Four Season’s establishment. Each diner has two sets of chop-sticks and a spoon, one set for personal use, the other in case you wish to pass food to someone without using your used chopsticks! Attention to minor details such as this creates a favorable impression.The food we had for this birthday dinner included complimentary Longevity buns, followed by their signature Jiang-Nan Chun Peking Duck which was served with both, normal flour and spring onion wraps; sugar, sliced cucumber and onion shoots, plumb sauce and black caviar. The duck had a strong delicious aroma of the wood oven. The duck’s skin was crispy and devoid of fat, and the caviar contributed a slightly saltish taste to each bite.The Double-boiled Chicken soup with Morel mushrooms, dried scallops and fish maw was next and this had a light stock that carried the subtle flavors of the scallops and mushrooms beautifully.We then had the Deep-fried Boston lobster with almond and crispy rice. Around the table, I could hear only murmurs of satisfaction as we devoured this absolutely striking dish of succulent crunchy lobster flesh flavored with curry leaves accompanied by roasted almonds and crispy rice. The Simmered Sea Perch with Beancurd Skin and Wolfberry in carrot broth was next. The fish was well cooked, the flesh crunchy and firm pairing so well with the green vegetables that came with it.We then had the Hong Kong crispy egg noodles with slow cooked beef cheek. The gravy was a little thick, but the beef cheeks simply melted in your mouth. Before the final dish which was a desert, we were served a small tumbler of aloe vera jelly to wash down the palate. Finally came the chilled Aloe Vera with lemon grass jelly which was a refreshing finish to the whole meal.The Restaurant is opened daily for lunch at 11:30 am — 2:30 pm; and for dinner 6:00 pm — 10:30 pm. It’s best to phone in advance for a reservation or to email the Restaurant to avoid disappointments

We had the set lunch for two at $95 per person. There were six courses in the set. The roasted pork belly was crispy and not too fatty in the first course. The soup came in a good portion, full of seafood. The next dish was cod done just right in a vegetable broth. We changed the beef to chicken for the 4th dish which was done with good wok hei. The mee pok dish was excellent with prawn and scallop in XO sauce. The dessert was almond cream which was not too sweet. The service was excellent and accomodating letting us to change two of the dishes. A very good lunch experience in a pleasant environment.
4
While the restaurant remains as good as ever, this time out, I felt the dim sums were not as good. Arguably the arrival of chains like Tim Ho Wan etc have raised the overall standards in Singapore - and thus raised expectations. Still the ingredients are as fresh and dishes still prepared with a lot of care (certainly, the wonton noodles and braised beef were very good), but the dim sums lacked the sort of innovative touches I had become accustomed to, at this fine restaurant
5
Ambience was dark and exquisite- typical of a fine dine restaurant. Service was friendly and always ready to assist. Ordered their popular Peking duck Cantonese style and tasted fabulous. Given complimentary caviar which was absolutely unexpected. Had their Claypot dish like king prawns with glass noodles, wok fried assorted veg served in pumpkin. Overall recommended and spend a little to pamper yourself and enjoy the experience
5
Choices of food are great, service is first class bit price , but otherwise highly recommend.staff can't be friendliest , the service is always with the smile.
3
Food was ok overall, nothing fantastic. But it was served course by course making it a fine dining experience.
5
Tucked away on the 2nd floor of the four seasons hotel this fine dining restaurant has a great wine selection along with a sumptuous menu.
5
Best char siew bao with very tasty sauce, meaty, fresh and tasty siew mai and smooth and silky cheong fun.
5
We had our anniversary dinner here, and requested a specific table which the restaurant remembered! We went for the set menu and the food was excellent. They have a hairy crab special when it's in season which can be variable - the crab is sweeter although there's less meat. The most outstanding thing is the service - as with the rest of the hotel, they are attentive to your every need and yet not intrusive. I haven't been back since the renovation, but I'm sure it'll be as good if not better
5
Sunday lunch with the family at Jiang Nan Chun. We came to try the Peking Duck with caviar and opted for the Beijing version (each slice comes with some meat) vs the Cantonese version. The duck was impeccable, crisp and fragrant on the outside, tender and moist on the inside. A must try!Other dishes I recommend are their Claypot dishes eg kailan with Chinese sausages and ginger and braised beef brisket. Both are extremely tasty, well-prepared, beautifully presented and full of the wok hei flavours you expect from a fine dining Cantonese restaurant. Dim sum wise, they have very very good standards. Service staff are attentive although they are very stretched. Overall a fantastic dining experience in a beautifully decorated restaurant. Will definitely be back
3
Perhaps our expectations were too high for the dim sum at this restaurant located in the Four Seasons hotel. The good bits - service was attentive and very polite though it could do with some fine tuning (eg when we asked for the menu to order more food, we were given the dessert menu right away - we thought the server should have at least enquired as to which menu we wanted).The not so good bits:1. Where the restaurant was trying to be inventive, the dim sum didn't really work. The curry and cod puffs and the beef puffs were variations on the local curry puff but were tiny (see pictures) and not terribly inventive.The beef gravy served with the crispy noodles and braised beef cheek was too salty. We think they were going for an upscale version of the traditional Chinese dish of beef brisket noodles - fine if you like your noodles with a big chunk of meat.2. The more traditional dim sum dishes such as the deep fried prawn rolls, pork and century egg porridge, pan fried radish cake and scallop cheung fun were pretty good. Though we have to say we expected the cheung fun (steamed rice flour rolls) to have the finer, more delicate texture of high end Chinese restaurants.3. The dining table (at least the one we were allocated for a table of 3) was too small for a meal traditionally built around food to be shared. We kept having to shuffle the dishes around to make room each time a new dish was served. 4. The pastry for the egg tarts looked and tasted underbaked. The pastry was very pale and was neither crispy nor warm when served.5. Portions were definitely on the small side. We also think they could do away with serving almost every other dish with expensive edible flowers and channel the cost savings to better sized portions of dim sum.It would be great if this restaurant could do as well as the equivalent in the Four Seasons Hong Kong (the Michelin starred Lung Kin Heen). The dim sum offerings in Singapore need some work to get there.

This dinner almost didn't happen. I had intended to go to a hawker center (!!) for some local favorites but when I stepped outside the hotel the rain was fierce and I changed my plans. I was persuaded to try Jiang Nan Chun. I often avoid hotel restaurants because usually one can do better elsewhere (either for quality or value) but in my experience with Four Seasons hotels their restaurants defy the rule and deliver quality.Jiang Nan Chun has been recently renovated. The decor is quietly tasteful and subdued. The restaurant was moderately busy when I went, but volume levels were not intrusive. This would be a suitable restaurant for a special occasion or for a quiet dinner. I expect that it would be very nice also for a romantic dinner for two.The menu was the one with a number of Chinese New Year dishes or CNY variations on standards. Everything I had was good, well presented, light in texture, full in flavor and really enjoyable. The dim sum were beautifully light in texture but bursting with flavor. This is the delicate or more refined end of the dim sum spectrum. Even the carrot cake (lau pak ko, also called turnip cake) was lighter than usual.Soft shell prawn with almonds and crispy rice was excellent - fried but absolutely not greasy, some spice in the background but not dominant. The XO pork mee (noodles) were delicious and much more delicate than standard elsewhere. The steamed cod with cordyceps flowers and ginger was utterly outstanding: perfectly steamed, sweet and rich (phenomenal broth - add it to the rice for a touch of heaven!), immaculate texture.The service is highly attentive. Sometimes it is just a little intrusive but it is very well meant. It is Four Seasons service - if you've experienced Four Seasons service you know what this means: always striving to anticipate the guest's wishes and delivering what's wanted, efficiently and with a smile.I had not intended to eat this well that evening. Next time I would plan to eat there for a treat
4
Looking for a new, special dining experience, I visited Jiang-Nan Chun.The restaurant fits the bill perfectly.Away from the epicenter of hustle bustle, typical Orchard dining venues but yet central, Jiang-Nan Chun’s quiet elegance left a very good first impression. Decor is classy oriental and still feels cosy. Further, I couldn’t help myself smiling at the friendly yet sophisticated and professional staff who treats their job with love.Food was certainly of a high standard, and above mid-range pricing. After ordering one of the dishes (carrot cake), we were being informed that its main ingredient wasn't up to chef’s requirements and recommended to cancel it. I enjoy dining at Jiang-Nan Chun and would recommend diners looking no further than here, for a refreshing change- you’ll be charmed.Karen13th Feb 201

One of my favorite Chinese in this city! Consistent service and food at all times. Whenever we need to entertain or a family gathering, this would be our restaurant of choice. Kim, Mun Yee and the team are absolutely a gem to this property. Highly recommended
3
Love the ambience in this restaurant. Service is good. Food is average to good. There is no wow factor in the food which could leave us something to talk about.
5
Excellent Chinese food - although not run of the mill. Beautifully prepared and presented. Not cheap but definitely worth it.
5
We had a great dinner at Jiang-Nan Chun. Bit of a spur of the moment decision to eat in while we were staying at the Four Seasons and we were very pleased we did. The service and food were both excellent. By the time we left, every table was taken. Not a big surprise based on the experience that we had.
5
Jiang-Nan Chun - what can I say, the Chinese cuisine was Out of This World. As a non shellfish eater, the staff ensured that my dishes were not compromised in taste - infact I loved the vegetarian option better than the meat versions too. Definitely one of the best in Chinese Food (hotel standard
4
I have visited a number of times for dinner and have been happy with the consistent quality I find there. Service is decent and the food is tasty and plentiful especially the well prepared Beijing Duck. I always pick up my moon cakes from here for mid Autumn festival. Another reason it's one of my preferred Chinese restaurants in Singapore
4
Whenever I'm craving Peking duck I always head straight to Jiang-nan Chun at the Four Seasons Hotel and order a whole duck. For the first serving it's using traditional preparation of thinly slicing just the skin. The crispy skin is served on soft flour tortillas with hoisin sauce, frilly green onion segments, sliced cucumber and freshly sliced chili padis! For the second duck course I prefer it either chopped up and served in lettuce cups or just chopped up to eat as is. Plus this second way always provides enough extra duck that gets taken away and makes for a yummy lunch the next day!
4
This is an excellent concept, which we don't see enough of in Singapore, with a menu-based brunch - rather than having tables oozing with food, most of which will be wasted, you order from a menu as much as you can really eat - far better and has only positive effects on the freshness and quality of the food. Food is delicious, fresh and with a very good mix of options for all tastes.Delicious fresh juices, a kids' room nearby to occupy the children if they get a bit bored and overall the excellent staff synonymous with Four Seasons properties.Great spot for family and friends all year round. A tip: if driving, don't forget to ask for your parking voucher, the carpark has rather high rates otherwise
4
I personally think this is one of Singapores little treats. An old and classy little part of Singapore. We go as a family maybe 3 times a year and have always found it to be consistent and the staff very friendly. It's probably not the cheapest place to eat ($310 approx for three of us yesterday), but to be fair it's right in the centre of one of the most expensive cities in the World. A good spot for a family occasion.
4
My sister and I went to stay at Four Seasons Singapore a few days ago and we heard about their onsite Chinese restaurant - Jiang-Nan Chun that is supposedly very decent.We decided to eat there for lunch and thought that the food quality and service were great. It was decently priced for the quality offered.I'd happily visit again if my trip brings me back to Singapor

After Dreams of the Red Chambers and Legend of the West, Four Seasons Jiang Nan Chun introduces their Literature series once again and the theme is none other than "Four Great Beauties of China" I was not only mesmerized by the exceeded beauty of the dishes, but also dazzled by the narration that reveals the other side of these legendary personalities. Why does Yang Gui Fei love soaking in fragrant baths and how can the fishes be so amazed by beauty of Xishi that they forgot to swim and drowned to their blissful death? The 5-course menu is really worth trying and I highly recommend you to do so before it ends on 31st Jan. Visit user's blog under profile for full review and pics

When we came this restaurant, all the customer were Chinese. Food was really beautiful and tasty. I love white shell crab with wasabi sause. We brought 2 kids, they were 6 and 10 years old. They enjoyed chicken and fried rice. Wine was also nice.
4
Overall very good dining experience. Price is little higher than most other similar restaurants, but still reasonable for it's location and service.
4
Jiang Nan Chun serves Cantonese cuisine in luxurious settings. Their Peking duck is excellent, particularly their pancake wraps which is super thin, thus allowing you to savour the crispy duck skin. Dim Sums is also worth trying, generous with meat and fillings. My favourite is the custard burns with salted egg yolk. Overall, was a sumptuous dining experience
4
Regularly touted as one of the chinese restaurants to go to in Singapore over the years, we finally had the opportunity to give this establishment a try. I must say its one of those dinners where you leave feeling satisfied with both the food and your choice of restaurant.The soups were superb. sophisticated texture and flavour, try any.Commendable steam fish, great prawns, XO noodles, dessert We did not order the Peking Duck but judging from the few that were being carved, the colour suggested perfection.While the service was just a little slow, the warmth was genuine and the diners at the tables around us were impressed by the maitre d's knowledge of the cuisine and Chinese history. best part it was not expensive for such settin
5
This is by far the best Tim sum we had! Highly recommended! The staff here are the best and they certainly wants to make your dining experience to the best. They served us complimentary Chinese birthday bun even we were not obvious about our occasion. Mr Ng Choon Kim, the Restr. manager was all hands on and he overheard our greeting and just took the initiative for the nice surprise. The restaurant is very posh, more for business lunch during the weekdays but he did not make us feel out of place at all, and he take his time to chat with us and it really make our lunch more interesting. We are very happy to come here for lunch today, and like to congratulate four season to have such a good staff. We will definitely come back again and again

It's not often I would bother to review a restaurant, in fact this is a first. The quality of the ingredients is first class. Plenty of restaurants throw off cuts into dim sum, not here, you barely need to chew. BBQ pork bun fluffy while moist, amazing. Despite its location in the four seasons, not expensive at all, and wonderfully happy and attentive crew

Had a biz lunch here.Service is as expected of high end restaurant.Since it's just two of us, we decide to go for DimSum. Good food. Good atmosphere too as it's not noisy, perfect for biz lunch or dinner.As I did not pay the bill, not sure about the price

On the second floor of the Four Seasons, this restaurant has a quiet exclusive setting. The food is served to please the eye and the palate. The time-sum was delicately prepared and my favorites were the baked flaky chicken pastry and the pork dumpling and baby abalone.Baked cod fillet in miso sauce was a glorious melt in the mouth texture. Tofu with assortment of mushrooms was delicious.The small glass of kalimansi juice before the dessert was served was an excellent way of 'cleansing the taste buds' so dessert could be fully appreciated. We had chilled aloe vera with lemongrass jelly - light, fresh and a perfect end to a delightful meal.The service staff were outstanding - efficient, warm and responsive

For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/04/oriental-weekend-brunch-buffet-at-jiang.htmlWe were here for the Ala Carte Oriental Weekend Brunch Buffet (Featuring extensive selection of dim sum items and chef's signature dishes) Some of the food was quite good while some were average but I think the desserts here really need big improvements. The service here was the best that i had so far, really can't find any fault in them! Their service was very warm, very polite and very efficient. The whole dining experience was very comfortable

A friend living in Singapore suggested our "adventurous / high end meal" be here at the Four Seasons. We tried the lobster clay pot, some dim sum, and some roasted and BBQ meats, duck, chicken, suckling pig and jellyfish!! All were very good and the best thing about our "high end meal", was it was half price compared to the tourist trap - No Signboard. The staff were super attentive and of course respectful as you would expect at a Four Seasons. Every bit of dining pleasure. You should try Jiang-Nan Chun if you get the chance

Delicate flavours, well presented. Only pity was I had, had a big lunch. Next time, i'll be sure to take my best appetite with me.

Great attentive service, very good food, generous pours and a great table at the window characterised out first visit here. It's a nice alternative to the other brunches in Singapore.

Great business lunch option at The Four Seasons Hotel. Frequented by the local movers and shakers, a good choice for a working lunch. There are several options to choose from in Singapore, if gastronomy is your objective. However, if good Cantonese food (Dim Sum and Entrée choices), Ambience and 'Impress' factor is desired, absolutely a great pick

Not the biggest Four Season fan but when it comes to the blend of fine hospitality in a chinese restaurant I quite enjoy it. For me personally one of the most tastiest Dim Sums (with a price) but certainly a worth it. full focus on the product and taste. Very popular amoungs business people and regulars. Ask for window table and DO NOT try to eat any of them in white piece.A) they are good enough to bite twiceB) the are super hot insid

We had the set meal at Jiang ban chun, hoping that it would be a good introduction to the food while we stayed above in the hotel. However we found the food to be generally only passable, and underwhelming to say the least. There are a number of excellent Cantonese restaurants in Singapore but we would recommend that you look elsewhere. The showcase here is somewhat lacklustre, the dishes were not well executed and what should be a main course in a set was fairly small in portion size.What made the experience a greater disappointment was the general lack of service- the waitresses put dishes on the table without introducing the dish, the maitre made uncalled for comments and appeared to focus his efforts and attention on selected tables (is there a reason for differentiation?) and the lady at the front of house was impolite when we asked if we could be seated somewhere further from the entrance. All in all, my sincere opinion is that for Cantonese cuisine, it would not be difficult to find much better food just a stone's throw away.

Not all have read the Chinese Classic "Dream of the Red Chamber" 红楼梦 but now it is not just a book but has been transformed into a seven course meal curated out of the 168 recipes from the book.For details and pictures : http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/01/jiang-nan-chun-dream-of-red-chambers.htmlThe entire was not only a feast for the eyes but also for the mind as the very knowledgeable staff takes time to explain the romance behind each dish. The taste, of course, is beyond words.The ala carte on the other hand, was rather average except for the spinach tofu. Will be back for dim sum

Its somewhat cold in attitude, staff is not smiling but is absolutelly effective. Ambience of an old classy hotel - well, what else would you expect from Four Seasons... - silence, quick service and chinese food prepared the way more than acceptable for European hygiene freak :-). I do not enjoy eating on the streat in China so this encounter with chinese cuisine whas for me a revelation. Uncomplicated straightforward food which delites your palate. Higher prices but that is not surprise

we ate here for our 30th anniversary. The five course meal was impressive, so much so, that we kept the menu: peking duck, chicken soup, beef tenderloin, steamed cod, and deep fried bananas. We took pictures too. This restaurant is quite formal, but they make you feel at home
