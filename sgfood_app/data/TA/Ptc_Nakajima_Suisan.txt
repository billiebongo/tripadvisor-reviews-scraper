It's always queue there as food is reasonable if you love fresh and good value Japanese style set meal. Value for money wise, it is hard to match in Orchard area. The drawback is waiting time that can be 30 minutes or more.

Been here several times just for the food. No doubt the service staff/ cashier always rude and unfriendly. Like I do owed her millions of dollar. I usually ordered lots of food as it is cheap. Sometimes 2 of us we ordered 4 set and 1-2 more ala carte. The cashier seem impatient waiting my order. Male staff all seem friendly. Except this lady. I will ask for her name next time haha. Don't come with high expectation, just order and eat your food. The cashier will not entertain any of your questions. The more u asked the more darker face she will give u.

It's my go to place for Grilled fish japanese style. And they have LOTS of fish variety! Always fresh, succulent, & grilled to perfection! My favorite is Mero (chilean sea bass). I've also tried their Abura Karei, quite good too. Also mackerel. If you love fish, this place is a knock out!!

This is a hot eating place in Orchard area for its competitive pricing and reasonable good dishes. For the price, there are not many choices if it is Saikyo set, Teriyaki set or Shioyaki set. Lunch crowd is normal so you have to be early to avoid long queue. A waiting area is provided due to limited seats.

My friend and I ordered a chawanmushi ($3) and two grilled set meals: Buri Kama (Yellowtail Collar) Shioyaki and Hyou-on Ginhiras at $17.50 and $13.50 respectively. The Yellowtail was tenderly soft and succulent, lightly salted (perhaps, a tad fishy, even with the lemon slices) while the latter was fragrant and fresh; both were beautifully well-grilled and compatible with chopstick usage. The steamed-egg was silky smooth and wonderful, especially when eaten with a tinge of wasabi, chilli powder and soya-sauce. Adding quite a bite!The menu prices at this no-frills eatery were generally lower than those of comparable Japanese eateries, particularly in the Orchard Road area. The seemingly never-ending queue during peak-hours bore ample testimony to its popularity among both locals and visiting tourists. (A blog dated April 2012, which I coincidentally came across, had enthused about the Ginhiras dish@$9.50 then. Things sure have changed in just four years!

My friend and I visited Nakajima Suisan@Takashimaya Basement 2 on 26 Feb 16. We ordered two Charwanmushi/steamed egg ($3 nett) and two grill-sets ($13.50 nett): the Honmaguro Nodo Set (Bluefin-Tuna, Throat Portion) and the Gin-Hirashu Saikyo Set (Salted Fish Fillet). Aside from the fish item, each set was served with a miso soup, steamed rice, radish pickles, cold soft-toufu and a salad: very well-rounded nutrition indeed!The food-court-style eatery had, over the years, proven itself to be extremely popular with both locals and tourists, based on the ever-present queue of patiently-awaiting lunchtime customers. Customers can choose a counter seat or table seating.The décor was casual and minimalistic but functional; customers paid for their orders before staff seated them expeditiously. Aside from the reasonable food-pricing and courteous and efficient staff as pull factors, the food was truly delicious and satisfying. The “Honmaguro” was soft and tender with lots of fish fat. Indeed, truly gourmet dining! Staff quietly told us that the item was only available occasionally (not all the time).There was a good variety of pre-prepared sushi packs as well - customers (take-away or eat-in) understandably would be spoilt for choice. The hot green tea was complimentary.Among our all-time favourite side-dishes were the Oden soup and the Charwanmushi; the former containing a hard-boiled egg, slices of well-cooked daikon radish, konjac and processed fishcake stewed in a rich, tasty broth while the latter’s steamed egg-white would be ultra-silky smooth, tasting heavenly, especially when taken with a dash of wasabi and soy-sauce

Nakajima Suisan serves really yummy fishes imported from Japan, the Mero Saikyo set is my personal favorite, grilled expertly with all the melting fats and sweetness, it is a must try for fish lovers...or fish eaters :P They also serve a whole lot of other fishes, tried the Unagi, the Hokke Hiraki, the Salmon teriyaki. All taste good but nothing beats the Mero Saikyo. It comes in a set, with green tea, salad, pickles and miso soup. It is not too expensive, and well worth it. The only downside of it, is the long queue during peak hours and weekends, probably have to queue for like 10-20 mins to get a table after ordering
