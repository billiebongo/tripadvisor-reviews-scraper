Loved the food and the hip atmosphere. The service was excellent too. The crowed also seem very fun and hip.

Excellent risotto and various other tapas. Everything was excellent. Nice drink menu with a number of custom inventions.

Requested receipt, still have not receive yet.
Do not understand your service. is it Singapore style??
4
All dishes were artistic and tasty.
I could enjoy not only the taste but also the color and decoration.
5
Place was nice and laid back, food was amazingly good. Highly recommended. It's a great place to order many dishes and share among your friends.

IF YOU LIKE NICE FOOD....then go to this restaurant. Easy review. Yes, maybe a bit pricey. But then it's singapore and so it was always going to be a bit dearer than lots of other big cities. That's literally the only negative I can think of. BUT the food. If you like good food.......Just go. Seriously. It's great. We had 6 dishes. Each was, in its own right, a bit special. The waiter tried to get us to order less. To be fair.... Could have tried to sell us more. But didn't. I like this. We wanted to be greedy and ordered a fair amount. We were so full, but could bare to leave any food. It was just so nice. Obviously we didn't have the whole menu.....but I'm willing to bet you could shut your eyes, randomly point to the menu and still have an amazing meal. I love tapas, and this is certainly something that's not your usual tapas fare. But we loved it and if we didn't live thousands of miles away would go back in a heartbeat
5
I have ate in many places around the world but this one was just incredible. The food was out of this world. We probably ordered too much but refused to leave any as it was just too nice. It is pricey but you get what you pay for. It was a special meal and our waiter was fab! Funny, great banter and so attentive. I would definatley return!
2
Poor management of table reservation. We were not told of 2 seatings during booking and were hurried to finish our meal. Service staff was pretty nasty. We had been there to celebrate a friend's birthday and we all agreed that we will not go back anymore
5
My partner and I sat at their communal high tables as we reserved a table kind of late. Despite the initial thought that it might be quite awkward sitting so close to strangers side-by-side, it turned out fine! We had enough space to ourselves and our food, and the communal feel created a nice lighter atmosphere at the restaurant. The food was amazing! Loved their tapas, especially the patatas. We tried the scallop paella and was really impressed with the tastiness of the rice. Cocktails on the other hand was pretty normal. Overall an amazing experience and would definitely be back again to try other tapas and paellas
2
This is one restaurant that is entirely hype. Food is hit or miss. Portions are pathetic. Some are adequate and some, it's there but you have to look for it. Service is terrible. Grumpy waitresses, grumpy manager. Not at all a pleasant dinning experience. Not sure they actually know what service is all about.... Oh be prepared to pay atrociously expensive prices for a teeny blob of food. We didn't even bother to stay for desert and move to the fantastic restaurant down the road who knows service and food
5
Great time with colleagues for lunch. Recommend beef cheeks, octopus, scallops, chocolate galaxy and mini burger desert.
5
This venue has great vibes and most importantly of all, great food and wines offered! Wasn’t there to hungry thus ordered a few tapas to share with my partner!! Will be back for sure!! We were Super full when we left!!
4
The desserts were something I would go back for as they are interesting, Creative and taste really good.
Tapas was good as well in general.
5
went with my wife , short trip to Singapore !
great moment , great time, food amazing, cocktails too ! what else ?
5
Great food, awesome service, nice and cosy ambience! My friends and myself enjoyed our dinner thoroughly!
5
Staff were very willing to help us with my Father in Law who was on wheelchair down the stairs. Water were soon offered after being seated. Table already setup based on my requirements. Everything in the menu are so enticing! Food was not overly salty and was well balanced. Really tasty! Coffee was really good too. Robust! Music was a tad too loud. Will b great if they play Spanish music to complete the vibes.
4
Great ambience but a little dark if you wanna take photos of the food. Service staff was super attentive and friendly, explaining the menu patiently and looking out for our needs. Spanish tapas is usually a little heavy on the taste. Price is a little steep but overall a nice dining experience!

My family was recently in Singapore and we were looking for a place to eat on a Sunday night. My son found this restaurant as it was only a short walk from our hotel The Park Royal on Pickering. We were suppose to have a table but they asked if we could sit at the bar and we said that we didn't mind. By being seated there, we could see all of the food being prepared. We like to watch cooking shows so it was very interesting to us to watch the different dishes be made. We also talked to some of the staff while we were waiting for our food to come. It's a tapas type restaurant so we kept ordering more dishes until we were full. There wasn't a bad dish. Everything was delicious. We ordered the following dishes: chicken croquettes; patatas bravas: zucchini, basil pesto and rocket bikini; charcoal grilled sweet potatoes with quinoa, feta and sundried tomatoes; prawns in rich garlic sauce, baby lamb ribs with eggplant and angus traditional beef cheeks with parsnip puree. We ended the meal with two outstanding desserts of Spanish French toast with homemade vanilla ice cream and the FOC mini chocolate burger. I can't say enough good things about this meal
5
The Singapore Outpost of CalPep. Expected good things because my wife are here 3 years ago. Not disappointed. The potato's bravos were amazing. A millefeuille fried to perfect crispiness with a great topping off tomato and mayo. A perfect riff on a classic. All others dishes cut from the same cloth- classic but not. Then the chocolate hamburger. Quintessential Spanish coming. Looks like one thing but it's something totally different. Great. Only quibble is the very poor red wines by the glass. To terrible and one average. Could do much better than this in that regards but otherwise a great night - excellent charming attractive attentive wait staff, great atmosphere cause dining at its best. No idea where the previous complaint of poor service came from. Certainly not our experienc
2
Birthday dinner for 8 last Saturday. The minute we arrived we were rushed for everything by the staff. We were experiencing one of their menu and did not have time to finish one dish that the next one came on the table. Even after we asked them to slow down a bit the rhythm, nothing changed and the main waiter showed his arrogance and attitude. The best was when they decided to bring the so called birthday cake while 5 of us were taking a small break outside. They could not careless! Before posting this comment I wrote to the restaurant to give them a feedback...the manager was supposed to get back to me but I have not heard from him so far. Not a surprise
5
One of the best restaurant I went to in Singapore, the service was perfect and the food was amazing. Strongly recommended!
3
Tried the eel and Foie Gras dish for the first time. Interesting but probably stick to the prawns and octopus
5
Having tried Pim Pam and liked it, I decided to give FOC a try. The popular dishes - croquettes, octopus, eel and pork, seafood paella, lived up to their hype. I will be back!
5
Cool interiors, efficient service, excellent food. Must tries are the patatas bravas, scallops, squid ink noodles and croquettes
4
A regular here. Some servers are familiar with what is gluten free, some are not. The paella are delicious though standards can vary sometimes
5
It was our first time to this restaurant and we really enjoyed the food, good quality and service. The staff were very professional in their recommendation of the dishes and in their explanation of the history of the restaurant too.
5
good food, excellent service, good ambience, would definitely return for a visit. highly recommended
5
Ham croquettes were very tasty. The roasted chicken was divine - it was very moist and not dry at all. My only suggestion is for them to give better plates to customers - the red small plates are not stable when you need to cut meat.
5
I love this restaurant, enthusiastic staff and absolutely delicious food. I have been here many times and each time i come back, i always feel every dime well spent and happy! I will definitely come back and very often. I think i have tried most of the menu... i definitely recommend the following: peppers plate, toast and tomato, scrambled egg with chorizo, charcoal grilled octopus, cauliflower, garlic prawns aglio style, scallops with caviar, squid ink prawn octopus paella, barramundi bigger tapas for sharing and this christmas special i tried the wagyu beef cubes with brussel sprouts and of course to end off with wonderful desserts which i love - spanish french toast and chocolate galaxy. I love seating at the bar table watching how the chefs cook and plate them up, interacting with them as well. Wine and cocktail selection are great. I enjoyed my time each time i visit foc.
4
Food is consistently good here and the ambience is warm and intimate. Service was also good, which can be rare in Singapore. One of my fave restaurants in Singapore. The wine list is a bit overwhelming and expensive, but good for those who want the choice. Must have: paella, beef cheeks, and the cinnamon toast type dessert
4
We were delighted by the Spanish Cuisine at this restaurant.
All we had were gambas al ajillo, squid ink paella with sea food and a barramundi. All were palatable and satisfying.
We will be back again.
5
It was so nicE. Really going to re visit!! Especially the spanish baked rice ! And octopus leg is recommend able
5
Amazing spanish tapas.
Enjoyed sitting at the bar , watching the food preparation.
The best part was eating the amazing tapas.
4
Tried the new sweet potato dish. Good contrast of flavours with sweet and sour on the toppings. Recommend trying
4
We came here with family, who recommended it. Some nice tapas including the rice with pulled pork and scallops, the papas braves, which are definitely different and the ham croquetas. We had a smooth Spanish wine. It was busy and the ambience was good. It’s a good place to visit if you don’t want Asian food. Good service and as I enjoyed my chocolate hamburger I expect there were other great desserts too. It’s not particularly cheap but probably what you’d expect for the city centre
5
It’s definitely a place I love to go back to: the chef does a great job at revisiting some classics, by adding a fusion / Japanese taste to them, while also doing proper traditional Spanish cuisine. For instance the bikinis (usually ham and cheese) are revisited with a pesto and zucchini, and the oysters are served schucked with some flavourful herbs.The black paella is delicious even though we would love it with more seafood, as it gets a bit dull once you have eaten all of them. The wine selection is extremely interesting and never disappoints. Will be back soon!
3
Here's the good: - the service - very attentive and genuine - the wine - good selection of spanish wine - the iberico ham - top notch - the prawn in garlic - not bad - the ambience - great for a drink with friends & conversation The not so good- The mains were very average - the paella was terrible - tiny portion - flavourless, no lime, no spice - quite sad really- the dessert- that chocolate galaxy could use better chocolate quality - Its pricey Would I come back here? Yes probably for the ham & wine - stick to tapas and not for main course or dessert
3
Was there for dinner. Wines were generally above 100bucks easily. The tapas (cauliflower, Gambas) and paella were very tasty. Suckling pig n scallop paella was very very tasty but the portions was so small. They had oysters too but they remove the shell. I don't like that. Bottomline. Great food but I think its quite overprice
5
Now... it’s not that I’m prone to over indulgence, it’s just that the food is great, and it’s hard to keep track of just how much you’re eating when it’s tapas. In my defence, little plates of goodness that they take away - makes you think, why not - I’ll have another. Surprising tapasPasta bravas. This is an inspirational take on a traditional favourite - I won’t describe it - but I’ll recommend it x3 (which we did)Things on stick, arrived with a comment, “this will open your palate” - I didn’t note the name, but I wish I did... I’ll just have to go back Potato and scrambled eggs. Don’t laugh. But this is crunchy and eggy goodness Pork belly... need I say more? Garlic prawns - always fantastic, this was not a disappointment and to many on the table was probably the best. Ah... wine was good, service was greatI think we were one of the first ones in, and definitely the last one outWe had a great time, I sure do hope you do too - well worth goin
5
It's better to come here with a group of people because you can order more and try more dishes. I've been here before with just one other person, and with 3 other people, but this time came with a large group of colleagues. Service was great (good recommendations on dishes and portions) and food was delicious
5
Brought my friend for a birthday celebration, we were seated at the bar. The food was excellent and it’s been an experience watching all the staffs concentrating and taking pride in their work, making sure each dish served is perfect :)
5
First time there but absolutely love it. Great food and price is reasonable. Atmosphere is suiting. Definitely will go back again!
4
Super place for discovering great tapas in a casual ambience.
Great place to have a conversational dinner in a cool atmosphere and around creative food.
Great ingredients and tastes.
5
Good place for me to go in dinner time and will be my next time come to Singapore must come restaurant.
2
Had a sitting of 9 people, was advised at booking of minimum spend which I was happy to accept. Towards the end of the meal the waiter advised I was $300 short of the total minimum. When I asked to see a receipt it was actually around $50, quite a big difference to make a mistake. Initially the service wasn’t great with not much help re the menu, however this improved by asking a different waiter. Average cocktails Food good, not outstanding Good setting for groups Great design inside Bar staff not overly friendly Likelihood to return - minimal
2
The service was adequate as there were only 6 others in the restaurant. It was thoughtful for the server to offer me a smaller portion to accommodate a solo diner. They gave me one ham croquette and one mushroom instead of a serving of 4. I could barely taste the ham but the mushroom croquette had a deep mushroom flavour. The Classic Pisco Sour was much too sweet but they kindly offered me some additional lime juice. I was so looking forward to the beef cheek and parsnip ($38) but it was unbelievably bland and boring. I guess the novelty of being able to eat it with a spoon is supposed to win you over. Disappointed, I wouldn’t eat here again

This was a Gastro-month restaurant curated by Robert Parker. We prepaid for this event. I must say this is extremely disappointing. By far the worst restaurant I have ever stepped into. I totally do not understand the hype and how they even got the good reviews at all!We were there on Sunday 19 Nov to celebrate a friend's birthday. We shared this with the front of house and she said we'll prepare a little brownie and serve it during dessert.Food wise:Only the first course, oyster - celery and cucumber essence was a 7/10King Crab Cannelloni - unmemorableTuna Belly Tartare - unmemorable as I didnt know if i was eating tuna or kimchi.Codfish Mellow Rice - It takes talent to screw up cod fish!Iberico Pork Cheek - overcooked and toughGrilled Angus Rib-eye - THE WORST EXPERIENCE! Doneness is rare to medium-rare, and it was extremely salty! when I used my torch light, we literally saw grains of salt. YOU SEASON YOUR MEAT BEFORE COOKING NOT AFTER! we returned it and they offered to recook - to which, I told them to not add so much salt please. AND THE DISH WAS THE SAME AS BEFORE! WE DID NOT FINISH THE DISH AT ALL!Banana Daiquiri - This was memorable. Because its so sour and couter-intuitive. The plating was good, looks sweet but was incredibly sour.Coffee with milk textures - was a saving grace for me but when we shared that my girlfriend and friend were allergic to caffeine, there was ZERO initiative to suggest alternatives.For $148/pax excluding wine, I have tasted way better and gotten way better service.Absolutely incorrigible!Service is a hit and miss. There are some good ones who pour you water when your glass is empty. Do not expect them to explain to you what the dish is about or whats in it. The worst is the front of house lady. She was utterly rude. There is nothing welcoming about her at all and before we left, she held us back. ITS A PREPAID MEAL! CHECK AND MAKE A NOTE AND NOT EMBARRASS ME OR MY GUESTS!HOW THE FOC DID YOU GET YOUR GOOD REVIEWS?
5
Ive been a few times and its always good. Tapas are great cocktails well executed.My only gripe this time would be floor service. It seemed understaffed and one server under trained. I asked for sherry pedro ximenez she responded with a vacant look and we dont have that when clearly they do. I pointed it out on the menu. Training.
3
I wanted to rate a 4 here because of the food but at the end of the day I couldn't due to a total lack of competence when it came to finalising our bill. Unfortunately it took THREE attempts to get this right. We did have to move tables due to the fact we ate at the earlier sitting time but you would not think this would cause a problem, it did. The bill was quite a reasonable amount for a party of 3, hence the diligent checking.Unfortunately the way the evening ended really put a dampener on our experience. We have been here a couple of times previously and to be fair, I would highly recommend eating here, the food is divine and usually the service is great. The flavours and the variety on offer is exceptional.I have written this review for feedback purposes, not to detract from any future customers eating here.Just check your bill....
4
We went there just to have a remind of our country of origin flavours. We have to say that some of the dishes were better than others but the overall experience was good. The croquetas were by far the best. The patatas bravas were acceptable, quite original. The pulpo a la gallega was a bit meh.. It can be cooked better and server in bigger portions!. Finally, the cafe con leche dessert was simply delectable and yummy.We will go back to try a new round of recipes
5
Service was meticulous and food was served well paced, not at one shot. Most importantly every dish was well executed.
5
Great service, made for a fun experience!! Food was so delicious. Will definitely come back and recommend to everyone :)
5
Very impressed with this place. The food was delicious and the staff very attentive. We particularly enjoyed the suckling pig and scallops paella.
5
Had a business lunch which was by far the most delicious for a long while now. The Iberico ham, asparagus and suckling pig/salmon paella were superb!!
5
Tasty tapas & paella. Good drinks. You HAVE to make a booking in advance otherwise it’s impossible to get a table.
4
Attentive service, warm and accommodating introduction to the food. One of my guest is pregnant and the service crew gave her an extra cushion just to make sure that she's fine.Octopus Galician Style is a must order. We fell in love with their wide range of good desserts too, especially FOC Crunch Bar. Gonna make a reservation to head back this month.

FOC SingaporeThis is a tapas restaurant located on Hong Kong Street. The restaurant has a good vibe and offers both table and 'at bar' dining, additionally, there's a small outside sitting area used for waiting patrons.Apart from the rather brusque young lady who does the front of house, the rest of the staff were attentive and friendly.The food and wine were both excellent. We tried a variety of dishes including the mushroom croquettes, the ham croquettes, the chicken paella, the peppers, the patatas bravas and the tuna salad.I'd definitely go back
5
Foc in Hong Kong street is superb!! The food is delicious, the taste and execution of each dish is perfect.Service is also incredible. Today we were there, we made a comment and the follow up was impeccable. The chef should be proud of his work and dedication to lovely food. Perfect every time! Cannot recommend it enough I am a fan of Foc. As this restaurant In Homg Kong street is so popular, they now have two more restaurants in Singapore. The three restaurants are great and different. Pim Pam foc is great for families and Foc sentosa has a beautiful setting on the beach and also offers delicious Mediterranean food
2
Entirely my fault for not researching more thoroughly. We were really looking forward to the evening and food experience. Four of us reserved and were given seats at a table that was probably four square metres. Designed to seat eight. A two couples of guys joined to make it full. The table. The background (foreground really as the speaker was within two metres) music. The lack of sound dampners. This all meant that the location was not conducive to a long overdue catch up with friends. So we left and went to the Italian (almost next door). $11 for a bottle of still water? Whatâ€™s that all about
3
3 of us went for weekend lunch at one of our fav places, FOC hk street. the food and ambiance is great as usual however the service leaves lots of room for improvement. the server failed to make a valid drink recommendation, later went insane in filling our wine glasses comically full! the constant clearing of plates and asking if we were finished made this lunch felt like hell! what's rush when there's only 3 tables during our time there! great food, but pls train your staff properly
4
Of my two Spanish tapas experiences in Singapore, this was my least favourite. The food was good but it was too noisy! Perfect for young trendy types, not for a small group of mature-aged folks wanting a good conversation. Good food without the conversation.
4
I must say, of the number of kitchens that carry the Michelin tag here on the island, this is definitely one of the few ones with cuisine that match and deserve the title.It was an early evening and we decided to not go heavy with the food, but still, every dish was done and served with precision. Every one was a delight to view and savor on. No overlapping of servings and we did not have to chase for our food. I had one of the best tapas and paella in Singapore with my orders.Hostess at the door was very insistent not to let us have a reserved table as we walk in, which would probably send some patrons insane, but I was certainly impressed with the professionalism. I hate it when my table would be given away even if I had reserved one.However I thought the ambiance could be a little less cold. My first compliment on the food received an awkward look and a thank you before the wait staff drifted away behind the bar, and my second got an "Oh yah? Thank you."Perhaps compliments are rare or too overwhelming over the years that numbed the recipient, but nonetheless, the chefs deserve a pat on the shoulders for cooking up a splendour for my money spent. Well done and we'll definitely be back for more
5
This place is quite small and usually is full for the dinner reservations. If you're not lucky to get a table, you can still enjoy tapas and the drink at the bar which is an open kitchen as well. Great experience!The menu is good and the food was delicious. Customer service was top notch as well!Good choice of wines. Enjoy the evening
5
6 stars for cleanliness, stayed until it was closing up. The stuff was preparing the kitchen for next day like crazy cleaning everything with boiled water. The owner - head chef?? was quite informative. Materials were hand picked and the dishes were a pleasant surprize. The pork rib extraordinary and the lamp just perfect. Do not skip it when in town
5
This is Tapas as I have never before experienced - even in Spain.The food had a modern twist and their deconstructed patatas bravas was heavenly. As were the scallops - and the cauliflower braised with pine nuts.For pudding the Spanish french toast with ice cream was a revelation! As well as delicious food - I had two glasses of a superb dry white wine and a post dinner liqueur. The cost of this was $28 (Singapore dollars).The service I received was first class - from fitting me in without a reservation and without any kind of fuss that trying to get a table for one can bring to the way staff made sure I was comfortable.I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. I am hoping to visit again before I leave Singapore
1
I have celiac disease and cannot eat ANY gluten- even a crumb will make me VERY sick. I had prearranged with the restaurant and checked that they could provide a gluten free dinner. Their menu also clearly marks which dishes are gluten free. So what could go wrong?? Well, two of the 'gluten free' dishes that we ordered came out with gluten all over them. - and the waitress said when she put the dish down 'you can only eat the TOP of the fish'. What the???? It was my birthday dinner, we had asked for a gluten free meal, the meal was marked as gluten free on the menu, but was brought out with bread crumbs all over it!! The waitress then went on to say to me - you can just eat around the bread crumbs . This restaurant was totally clueless about what gluten is, and the potential risk that it can cause to someone with celiac disease. Even after explaining for a third time that I get VERY sick if I eat even a crumb of gluten, their response was pathetic! My birthday dinner was ruined and I ended up in bed with a sever stomach ache.
5
Was received with a warm welcome, service staff was friendly, enthusiastic and professional. Food selection was great and quality of food is great too! Best of all, watching how your food is being prepared by a young team of chefs & cooks over at the bar counter was the highlight - love the energy & synergy that was going back & forth, their passion & professionalism are inspiring! The casual chic dining ambience makes the whole dining experience a pleasant one
4
Following T.A. recommendation, I wanted to try this Spanish place since I'm addicted to Spain... We went there for dinner (weekday) and the place was full with people sitting directly at the bar. Staff attention was great and friendly. The decoration is quite interesting with huge dolls heads (my partner found them scary :) .Food wise, very tasty food: delicious ham with pan&tomato, great octopus, and fantastic black rice.The wine list is excellent - I could find all the Spanish red wines I prefer most.Just a quick comment on dishes delivery that resulted to be far too rushed, and I had to send back some since we did not finish yet the previous one - and this despite my initial request. Please let us enjoy our moment :
5
I recently visited this restaurant for birthday celebration. From the name I though is only an ordinary cafe. Thanks to an effort from one of my guest who make an effort to book the only round table for 5 of us. The restaurant was pack on the Friday evening. We prepared five bottles of wine and start to sample the food and paring with our wine. I must say it was a truly wonderful experience. All foods are truly one Michelin standard but the most outstanding meal are the wagyu ribs and that half the size roast pig. Also we was served with superb services from the staff. Restaurant bit small but the atmosphere are fantastic. I highly recommend this restaurant if you are into European casual fine dining. Strong suggest to make advance booking. Enjoy
4
Food was very good, specially the pork. The tapas were very good as well, but nothing special. The drinks were fantastic. Service was friendly. I would prefer the music to be slightly lower so I could hear my partner speak, and a bit more light so I didn't have to force my eyes to read the menu. Overall a good experience, a one time thing for me, food was good but not willing to pay the price for it again
5
Had the most amazing time in this restaurant where the food is fancy ans very good. Plus we really appreciated the music played.
I highly recommend the squid ink paella and the tapas especially the patatas bravas.
4
Been here a couple of times and the food never fail to put a smile on my face as well as my tummy :)
5
Excellent food and service-- black squid ink paella, pork/eel tapas plate and mushroom croquettes HIGHLY recommended!
5
Place is as usual great...food was well prepared and paella was delicious. Tapas complement the wine very well. Highly recommended altho can be pricey
5
Best tapas food i had in singapore. Service and food is definitely thumbs up. Took many friends there and everyone loves it.
5
It's a noisy place, but once used to that and the food is on the table, you won't even notice it anymore. Such amazing prepared tapas and great drinks.
5
Loved the fideua. Tapas were great, as always. Creme catalana and chocolate galaxy were an awesome way to end the meal!
3
The place was buzzing for dinner. You definitely have to book in advance.We ordered a bunch of small plates to share. The food didn't disappoint. Lovely dishes - but could be on the small side. The restaurant is quite small so it can get a bit loud at times and you sort of have to shout a bit to talk to your companions. Overall - an awesome experience + lovely helpful staff
4
The food at FOC Restaurant was impressive. However, the service standard is inconsistent. I made a reservation for 2 @ 8.45pm on a weekday night. My friend and I were still chatting with our unfinished meals around 10pm (I can't remember exactly). We were the only ones left at the back of the restaurant, however, the front part of the restaurant was still packed with diners. The lady who served us was very polite and friendly. However, the other servers seemed very rushed to clear our tables and kept asking if we were done with our meals as though they were trying to rush us out of the place.
5
I arrived just as they were closing needing a nightcap as the hotel I was staying in was pretty poor. After getting the managers permission (Singapore shuts early) managed to sneak in an Estrella and their take on an aged negroni, which was awesome. Next time will eat ! Great staff
4
Restaurant has an interesting whimsical decor. Service was good as the waiters were attentive. We order quite a few Tapas to share but we especially like the paellla
4
Friends had told me about FOC and it's taken me some time to actually get there and I was not disappointed. Place was packed so booked ahead! Service was friendly/efficient, booze list was solid and food was excellent. Recommend you try the squid ink paella!
5
It was a great experience eating the meal. We especially enjoyed the paellas. We tried all and they were all really good. Definitely recommended.
5
All of the tapas we had were delicious, particularly the eel. The cocktails were innovative and delicious. The sevice was top-notch, very friendly yet also professional. It was a bit noisy, but it's a popular place! A great place to go with a group.
4
Contemporary decor matched with well prepared bite sized goodness. Good for hanging out but not ideal for families. Restaurant was flexible with portions and even suggested mix and match for croquettes.
3
A popular and hip place for Spanish food in Singapore. However, the word "restaurant" is a little misleading as the concept resembles more that of a tapas bar and/or gastro bar than that of a real restaurant. Music and general noise level is quite loud so having a dinner conversation without missing a lot of it requires some concentration. The tapas were good but very expensive. Wine selection for wines by the glass was surprisingly limited. Service was generally fine but at times it was hard to get the waiters' attention. Also one order got mixed up. Ok to have tried FOC once but I would probably not go back anytime soon
5
We travelled to Barcelona two months ago and ate at some fabulous tapas restaurants. We would have to say that FOC is one of the best experiences we have had. We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the cooking and presentation of the food. The cocktails at the bar were also a great experience to witness. The waiter suggested the salmon tartare, a special, which was terrific I. We also shared the asparagus dish and duck which were both outstanding. To cap off a fabulous evening we had the chocolate crunch for dessert, awesome. We will definitely return to FOC. Tip: go with cocktail and food recommendations
5
This is the third time we have been here for dinner and each time it has been consistently great. The service is great without being in your face of 'hovering'. We had the duck salad, barramundi and lamb chops between three of us, followed by the chocolate hamburgers and creme brulee. Everything was so good. They know how to accentuate the natural flavour of the food they are using and highlight its natural taste. Love it. Still think that their food is good value.
4
Having been a couple of times - i notice some dishes were not well seasones - fish croquettes were bland - the octopus was burnt on the outside and the chocolate cake dessert where the waitress is supposed to poor just a bit of the hot chocolate on top of the chocolate shell to ‘break it’ open - well she demolished it and we were just left with a puddle of chocolate and three sad profiteroles - a real shame.
5
FOC restaurant is a vibrant Spanish affair in the heart of Singapore with stunning food and outstanding cocktails. With Michelin-Starred Chef Nandu Jubany, Chef Jordi Noguera and award-winning mixologist Dario Knox. We decided to try out this hip restaurant For our wedding anniversary this year. Black Mediterranean Squid Ink Paella was unforgettable, although The seafood items were low in quantity with just four clams and prawns. But they were of good quality. The rice was very flavourful. The quantity of the rice in the dish is less than it looks as the pan was a very shallow one. It can be comfortably shared by two and still leave room to try the other items.

The paella was about 8 spoons in volume, 3 shrimps and some calamari.... not very well executed. The Barramundi was medicore, so was the duck confit. The tapas are lovely. Service is good but the quality of dessert is non existence.
2
We went to this restaurant for a late dinner. The tapas were creative but the taste was rather mediocre. There are better tapas places with a similar price tag in Singapore.
4
Delicious tapas but expensive even for Singapore. Nice atmosphere. Service was okay, but our waitress seemed to be annoyed.
5
Great Spanish fusion tapas and cocktails. Really love the atmosphere and decor. The food is quite pricey though, but definitely worth a visit!

We enjoyed excellent tapas last night at FOC. Croquetas de Bacalao, Gilda skewers and the cauliflower with pesto were outstanding. But I was underwhelmed by the pork and eel dish. Our waiter Ridou recommended a cava for the evening and it went very well with our food. To die for, however, was the Flaming Rum Baba. It's like a bread pudding with flaming rum poured on top and seeps through the brioche. The mix of slight burnt brown sugar and rum on freshly made bread - it was out of this world!Very few places are perfect and neither is FOC. Service was inconsistent. We ordered one type of paella. They brought a different one. No apologies but asked who took the order. And then another waitress asked if we just wanted to take this one instead because we would have to wait another 15 minutes. No smiles on either faces towering over us. We were having a great time, didn't want to make a fuss. But this level of service didn't meet the expectations we had for FOC. Luckily, Ridou saved the day with attentive and friendly service at the end. And a smile was finally forced out of our waitress somehow also. All in all, an enjoyable evening.

One will feel transported to NYC upon arriving here at this cool open concept bar/restaurant. Attentive service and warm, the food is unpretentious and bursting full of flavors at every bite! the paellas were really yummy albeit the small portion. overally, a buzzing crowd with great selection of food/drinks! reservations highly recommended before arriving
5
We went here after reading the trip advisor reviews! As people have previously stated it's definitely quite lively and loud but that was right up our street (only been 21). The food was delicious and reasonably priced, drinks were fairly pricey but we found that most places in Singapore were during our trip. Would highly recommend this place!!

Guess this suits younger people who need music as well as good food!Interesting seating concept whereby unless you are a large group of diners, you share a table with strangers? Combined with the recorded music, we found the food, although OK, it did not make up for the negatives. being a little old fashioned, we prefer quiet dining venues whereby (minus mobile phones) we can relax and enjoy each others company

i love spanish food, don't get me wrong. however, i think there's just too much hype about this place. so what i liked best was that the service was pretty good. lots of service staff - polite and attentive. they divided our paella into portions for us. our server was knowledgeable about the menu which is great and could recommend the dishes. however, the place was rather noisy so we could not hear him too well and he had to repeat a couple of times. food wise, i'm not sure.. . the portions are alright. i guess, the taste wasn't to my liking (too salty). if there's one thing which will deter me from returning, it is the table reservation policy. there's a 2 hours only thing. Our reservation was from 630pm-830pm only. we were informed about when we were seated (at 655pm) and half an hour before the time was up (at 8pm). we felt restrained, trying to have a conversation, eat and watch the time
5
If you are looking for an awesome place to have tapas that also has a fantastic crowd and atmosphere? This is the place to go!Reservations are highly recommended!Their food selection is very good and the ingredients used are well prepared and offers something fantastic for the taste buds. Portions are decent and you should order 2-3 different dishes per person. Depending on how hungry you are.Enjoy a cocktail before (or after) the dinner. The cocktail menu is very good. Filled with non-classics so you can try something new. Staff is attentive and helpful
5
Consistently fantastic food with knowledgeable staff & great buzzy but relaxed ambience. Easily best restaurant in Singapore.
4
it was my first time there. that's a place to take time for chill and wait for the dishes come to serve. Delicious food and nice atmosphere. Recommend for dinner :)
4
Has a lunch on a Wednesday, and everything was delicious, particularly the octopus and duck confit tapas, plus the cauliflower was super yummy. Tapas portions very generous too.
4
various tapas selection! we ordered 3 (eel+pork tapas was our favorite)
paella was definitely very cost effective with the ingredients (really fresh prawn you can get in restaurants in singapore!)
4
Great table for 5 with impeccable service throughout the meal.
We went for 15 tapas which left us all feeling very full! The food was superb .
Would definitely go again--- and again--- and again!!!
5
My friend and i wanted to have some Spanish cuisine. So I brought her here for dinner. This is my 3rd time here and I have always enjoy it. Good food, ambienece and service. Will definitely come again!
3
Friendly staff. Food is ok but we already had more refined tapas for less. I think there are better restaurants for the same price in Singapore.
5
Really fun restaurant with great atmosphere and delicious tapas. Always busy. Great drinks selection as well!
5
So slow at getting around to try this restaurant!! Great food, fun atmosphere and super service. Espresso Martini's are particularly good also!
1
This place is advertised as having a "Michelin starred chef". This could not be further from the truth. He may well have visited once, but I suspect he is tucked up safely at home in Barcelona well away from this madhouse. This is just a place selling very ordinary tapas at crazy Singapore prices, in a noisy environment with so many tables crammed into a small space you cannot breathe or speak to anyone. They even warn you when you book that you may not have a private table. In a Michelin-starred restaurant? This is mis-selling of the highest order - we exited quickly when we saw the reality. Truly awful
5
We were here for girls night and all 4 of us had to agree that the service, the food and the ambience was excellent. We will definitely come back!
5
We had a great meal at Foc. The service was excellent, all dishes were creative and had a great rang of flavours.
5
The food is just awesome. No doubt the best Spanish restaurant in town. Had to leave at 8.30pm so end up at 28 Hong Kong street for another drink.... it's just turn out to be a great awesome night
4
Had the jamon on the special menu, 3 types in the platter, quite good. Went very well with the tomato bread. Jaervice was great as usual
4
No doubt one of the best Spanish/ Tapas restaurants in Singapore. Delicious food served in a trendy and welcoming environment. The paellas are Ok and certainly second to the Tapas. Incredible deserts. Will certainly come back.
4
Food was good but for us to salty, we don't know is it too much salt or is the spanish food abit has salty taste? We like the service, atmosphere was good.. nice and friendly services.
5
Food was absolutely delicious. Portions were bigger than expected. Many gluten free items on the menu.
4
I could have rate 5 stars because clearly the food we experienced was excellent!Extremely tasty, every dishes we had (asparagus, open tortilla, paellas..) were amazing!Cocktails were good too!However, music was way too loud! We were 2 and couldn't hear each other! Likely, the sounds were nice, but just too much.
5
We went there because our college recomemded us. Was a bussines dinner and we really fall in love this place.Food was amazing, the octopus good cook, black paella awesome, the prawns and the croquettes fantastic. All of this join with a good wine, that recommended us the manager, did our night perfect
5
Went to FOC twice in a month because it was so good. Had a chance to try their duck and foie gras paella and the cuttlefish and seafood paella, both were excellent and flavourful. My date and I enjoyed the slow cooked octopus with the scrambled eggs with chorizo one after the other. It was a real delight. Ended the night with spanish french toast which was lovely as well. Wish the servers could explain more about the dish before serving but other than that, everything was great! Service was good and wait time wasn't long. Ideal for 2-3 pax to try 5-6 dishes
5
The food was extremely tasty, we loved every single dish (special mention for the mozzarella truffle bikini / the chocolate burger was the only disappointing item). The waiter was really nice and she recommended a great wine. Would highly recommend!
4
Full of buzz - great atmosphere! We had a birthday celebration there and it was just perfect! Martha was delightful, and we enjoyed every dish. The wine was expensive; the Gin Mare was really nice. A returner!
4
We were assigned the counter seats and had a good view of the live action in the kitchen. Very positive experience.
5
Had a fantastic night.
I'm always an advocate of bar seating if your looking for a tapas meal.
Great to see the action.
The food at this place was amazing.
Try for your yourselves..... flavourful and amazing!
5
Had a wonderful experience at FOC. The staff are so welcoming and friendly from the minute you walk in. The restaurant is really cool with a bar where you can sit and watch the food being prepared in front of you. Larger tables out tin the back area or smaller ones along the wall near the bar.The food was fabulous and the wait staff explain the food to you and know and understand each meal and where the ingredients come from. There is a definite passion about what they are doing here. We had mushroom croquettes and peppers tapas and then the baramundi and lamb share plates followed by the crema catalana. All the food was beautiful and beautifully presented. Watching the chefs from the bar and their teamwork added to the whole experience. The drinks were reasonably priced as was the food and we will definitely be back. Great night
5
The restaurant hunted me down to confirmed my reservation, give me a call when I was late but because i was parking. Turned out it's because they didn't want me to miss the best meal that I had for this year! All 4 dishes were great. Service was excellent. And it ended with a surprise bday cake for my financee! Definitely will come back again
5
A must chillout place for friends. Great ambience, great drinks ( always ask for the promos, they have some great ones) and good tapas! Although plating and concept of the same tapas have changed since the last time I was here. Nevertheless, tasted great for most of them.
4
My third visit to FOC Hong Kong street and I was not disappointed.Staff are friendly and helpful I needed guidance on choosing the food and drinks. We tried the Xapadillo eel, Wagyu sliders, sautÃ©ed cauliflower, iberico pork ribs, black squid ink paella and cafe con lecche for dessert. Each dish was very good, and I highly recommend the paella. There are specials which change each week...so check them out. The tapas del FOC portions serve 2 persons comfortably, and the Tapas Grandes serve 3-4 persons. The food is tasty, creatively prepared and well presented. There may be a temptation to over order so be careful! The place is busy , packed usually , lively all round. Music is nice but maybe a tad loud. The cocktails are very good and I would recommend the Night in Rio ( chocolate coated glass and negroni. A very good meal with drinks will costs between $75-100 per person.But it's worth the food and ambience. I'll be back 
5
We sat at the bar as we had not booked, but it was great to watch them prepare the food in the kitchen, the 4 cooks were hustling! Awesome Tapas, great cocktails, and a cool vibe. Worth deviating off the tourist strip a few hundred metres to eat here instea
5
We were sat at the bar. Perhaps not ideal as too close to the traffic of the waiters. Nevertheless food was amazing.Maybe avoid the typical typical Tapas and go for the special ones. The Watermelon "Gazpacho" was a very pleasant surprise.Place to visit agai
4
Tapas with a modern fusion twist and more refined. A mix of European, Asian ingredients.Price is higher than other tapas places that we've been.
4
Attentive service and excellent food. Interesting cocktails too.
Good for dates and friends gathering.
5
Managed to get a last minute booking on a Thursday night ( at the bar). Food was fantastic, great service. Loved the sauteed cauliflower with pine nuts, in fact loved every dish.
5
We enjoyed a fun, relaxed and entertaining evening sitting at the bar for delicious tapas and drinks. The food is gorgeous, drinks delightful, and staff entertaining. A good value and refreshing night out.
5
Great food, stunning presentation and very friendly and helpful staff!
The perfect place to celebrate a birthday!
Will definitely visit again :)
5
Was here on a Wednesday night and the place is fully packed. They captured the true essence of a chic Tapas Bar in Barcelona. Great vibes and great food
5
The flavours of the food were inspired and authentic, truly a worthwhile experience and a must go for any tapas afficionado. Had the sangria which packed a punch (hoho) and the stairway to heaven which did not disappoint. Considering making this my new regular hang out
4
This was our second time at FOC, but it seems that the novelty wore off and we were not as impressed as the first time. The food was still good, but there was something missing. We enjoyed our visits to FOC, but alas, the time has come to start exploring other places and satisfying our appetite
4
Excellent and very attentive service. Restaurant has limited seating capacity located at convenient location. Ambience is vibrant that can be loud and noisy at times. Its either communal tables that you get to share it with others outside your group or the bar seats. So you get to see and hear what every one is eating and conversing.Restaurant serves creative food combinations that uniquely blend very well with ingredients added to the mix such as pickled peas in the Sauteed Cauliflower with Pine Nuts & Spring Onion that add a little tanginess to the dish and Grilled “Ibérico” Pork Ribs & Smoked Pumpkin Purée where the puree is very refreshing. I would love to be given some bread for dips though. Octopus Galician style -Slow Cooked & Charcoal Grilled- is a disappointment though as the dish comes with a strand of hair from the kitchen and the octopus lacks the usual chewiness that I am expecting. Prawns in “Ajillo” sauce scored only average with plenty of rooms for improvement considering this is a signature spanish tapas dish.On a side note, most of the dishes are slightly oily and heavily flavoured commonly known for in spanish tapas that may not go well with every one. Nothing caught my eye at the desserts category but nonetheless, I still gave it a try on both the Piña Colada and “Crema Catalana” FOC Style. So my recommendation is to save your stomach elsewhere
5
Had the need for some real Spanish food. This place was no mistake. This is where you should go if you need well served tapas dishes made by a authentic Spanish chef. Brilliant food, fast and perfect service. Will absolutely go again the next time I'm in Singapore
5
If you are missing tapas and paellas, this is the place to visit! So delicious and worth the money you pay! Service is excellent and quite quick! Loved the atmosphere, so cozy! Highly recommended!
5
Title says it all... Great evening out at FOC. Highly recommended for any situation occasion. Spanish food at its best, comparable to some of the good ones I've tried in Spain.
4
A large selection of gluten free food. Though one item soy caviar labelled gluten free seems to contain soy sauce, which is usually non gluten free.
The slow cooked octopus is wonderful, so is the squid ink paella
5
Very good-- excellent food variety. Service ok but not best but overall a great experience. To return
5
My friend and I decided to drop by FOC for desserts after an unsatisfactory lunch elsewhere and boy, were we glad we did! They had an interesting dessert selection and both the Mini Chocolate Burger and Galaxy Bar desserts that we chose turned out to be gorgeous in presentation and taste. The waiter also noted that it was my friend's birthday and thoughtfully presented her with a complimentary brownie complete with a candle and hand-written Happy Birthday chocolate wordings. Our visit to FOC saved an otherwise awful start to the day and brought smiles to both our faces :) I will definitely be back to try the food and drinks
3
We just visited Spain so when we came back from Spain, we were really craving for Tapas. That's when we noted FOC. Food was authentic but the selection was so little and the price was way overpriced for the portion. For some idea, we had the green chilli tapas which cost us like 12++ but there were only 5-6 green chilli. In Spain, it was consider a appetizer and they were normally served a big bowl of it. Also, we hope the shop can retain its Spanish tradition of serving complimentary side dish when we ordered drinks. Overall, though the taste was good but we hope the selection and the portion can be a more next time.
4
Dining at FOC transported me back to Spain, where the flavours are rustic, bold, and straight to the point. My friend and I ordered 3 tapas and 1 paella, and had room for more. Unfortunately, we had to give up our table when the time was up as it was a busy night. Would have loved to try the desserts and other tapas on the menu!Highly highly recommend the octopus, best i have ever tasted, and the iberico and scrambled eggs is simple but comfortingly delicious.Looking forward to my next visit
5
Last night in Singapore after a 3 day stop over. Was looking for something special and FOC didn't disappoint. Sat at the bar and was entertained by Juan - head chef. He was engaging but not intrusive. He Recommended courses to match and they were delicious. Highlight was the piÃ±a colada dessert but everything was beautiful. Can highly recommend.
4
Another place we have been many times already simply because the tapas are excellent. Some of them can be relatively heavy on the stomach afterwards (don't have too many patatas bravas) but the overall quality is great. I remember on previous occasions they always tried to move us to a less attractive table and I really don't understand why. Also this time. Now however, a first for me, they moved us to the communal tables at the end. The music is very very loud there and you almost have to shout to talk to one another, not so pleasant while dining. Also, we were four and they seated us with four other on the same table, which makes it a bit crowded. Too crowded in fact combined with the music so loud there and especially for this kind of place. I mean this is not a food court, it's a high end tapas bar. I guess they're just trying to squeeze in as many people as possible but you have to realize that if people's dining experience is not so good because of that, they will be visiting less and checking out other places because there are sooooo many good tapas bars in Singapore after all. So I'll go again but will watch carefully how they deal with the seating then. If it continues in the direction I don't really like, this place might become less appealing to me.
4
Loved the ambience, loved the food, loved the friendly staff. Shout out to the head chef (I think) for going the extra mile to explain to us the dishes and mix 2 foods (which were supposed to serve in 2 different dishes) in 1 dish so that we could taste both with the price of one. I take one star off because when I confirmed my reservation over the phone with the hostess, she said, "we need the table back by 8.45." which was 2 hours after my reserved time. I understand that the restaurant might be busy and they need a second turnover (I have worked in restaurants for more than 5 years) but I find it rude and inconsiderate to tell customers that they only have 2 hours to dine and they have to leave after 2 hours. We enjoyed the food a lot and would love to order more but because of this hostess I decided not to spend more money on this restaurant so we went to another place to continue our date night. We ordered total of 7 dishes, 2 beers, and a cocktail and our bill was more than SGD 200 but less than SGD 300
5
I choose this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary And I we were not disappointed by the food, good wine selection and informal atmosphere.
5
have been here twice so far, food is consistently good, staff are very friendly and prompt with their service, and the ambience is relaxing. would come back again
4
My first visit to this restaurant. Quality of food was good with nice ambiance! Will definitely come back again with friends.
4
Tried the burrumandi and the chorizo and egged. Former was paired well with eggplant that was done mashed up
5
Booked this place for a work dinner and everyone had a great time! The restaurant setting was very comfortable with super attentive staff and good background music. Food was delicious. My boss enjoyed it so much he ordered second portions of everything! Thanks FOC!
4
Great second visit. Introduced this place to a friend who is a first timer. She was impressed. Food quality high, innovative, staff extremely efficient and attentive. Good place for a dinner night out. Not exactly the cheapest but good quality and ambience
5
Fantastic atmosphere, great food and wonderful staff. From the moment I walked in I felt at home. The menu was extensive and left me wanting more
5
Best Spanish tapas restaurant in Singapore! Great food and very nice atmosphere. Highly recommended.
3
my friend had told me about this place.but my experience there left me disappointed. The service was not outstanding, even lacking, as my hot water was not topped up even though I was sitting right in front of them at the bar seats. My friends who ordered the bottled still water had their glasses continually topped up!Food was nice but not special enough to warrant another visit.Can give this place a miss
5
FOC - means "Fire" in Catalan... not Free of Charge as the taxi driver thought (lol)...The Occasion: A delightful birthday dinner with a friend. Where: Up at the Bar. Far end of the bar, where we could see the whole open kitchen in action. The Food? Truly memorable! Possibly the best meal I have ever eaten. We started with Jamon and pan con tumaca followed by Jamon croquetas - which were excellent and I think I know because I pride myself in making excellent ones. Following these, oysters, scallops, sardines with olive oil ice-cream and tomato, the subliminal Coca de Foie, dessert and b-day cake. The FOC team are charming - both sides of the bar/kitchen and the place was packed - and it was a random Monday. Obviously this place has a massive following for a very good reason. We were even remembering and remarking of the deliciousness of the meal the next day... truly memorable. I can't recommend it enough. Thank you FOC Team, Head Chef Javier Rejas and Carme Marquez Arias
4
Flavourful tapas selection. Average-priced wines by the glass (or bottle). Attentive service. Trendy piped-in music, eclectic appointments, counter and sharing-table seatings keep the vibe young and upbeat. Not exactly an inexpensive place, but highly recommendable for dining patrons who value food quality, taste and service.
5
Excellent spanish fair. Tapas selection was wide and tasty... i would recommend the place to anyone who likes good food, regardless if its spanish or anything else
5
Always delivers a great night out. I love the roast vegetable salad the most. Everything on the menu is great.
3
A friend organised dinner for 6 of us at FOC last Saturday night. I'd heard great things and love Spanish food so was really looking forward to it.Nice table, nice ambience, attentive service, didnt have our first choice of wine but that's ok, there was a lot more to choose from. So far, so good.We ordered quite a few dishes - paella, chicken, octopus, patatas bravas, scallops and a few other bits and pieces. Unfortunately what was presented was generally underwhelming. Portion sizes were also a bit small. I think we all wanted to like it so much, and perhaps the expectations were too high. But overall, it was all pretty standard and rather average. From seeing the other reviews, it would seem we're in the minority though...
5
If you are looking for creative and real Spanish tapas, then go here! Our party of 4 enjoyed 7 or 8 different selections plus dessert and loved each one more than the last, if that's even possible. The grilled octopus, the chef special chicken, the paella, grilled cauliflower, ribs (our server removed the bone after serving the rack), the french toast for dessert. OMG, delicious and amazingly not too rich. Simply perfect. Service was excellent from start to finish - attentive and you don't feel rushed. We shared a high table with another group of 4 and it worked perfectly. The decor is fun, the music good. The vibe is very happy and happening and not stuck up. After dinner, walk down the street to the easy speak bar for cocktails to top off your perfect evening
5
we were suffering from Spanish food withdrawal symptoms after a great 2 weeks of eating in Spain 3 months ago. TripAdvisor recommended FOC for Spanish food and here we are.First the service is great and good selections of Spanish wine. However having paid 5 euros for a bottle of cava, I find the cava a bit pricey. We settled for 2 bottles of Spanish white wines and totally enjoyed it.The highlight for us was actually the octopus. Even though it is not octopus from Spain but the taste and texture was exactly how we had tasted in Barcelona. We also had croquettes and the cheese/ham is lovely. Do try the lamb as well. perfectly done - just right medium rare. We had 2 types of paella. I actually felt that it was better than those I have tried in Spain. I thought we had too much food to go for dessert but I can't say no to Manchego cheese! Go for the cheese
4
The decor was interesting with many hanging heads. The main dining room had full view of the kitchen without being fumigated.The tapas were well presented. Flavours were nice: mushroom croquettes, scrambled eggs with potatoes, cauliflowers, scallops with soy caviar, chicken paella and ajillo prawns.The desserts were creative too: mini chocolate burgers were made of white chocolate, and pina colada served as dessert.Worth a repeat visit
5
the main and tapas were good for sharing among 2-3 persons~ the mini chocolate burger is so cute and sweet~ the bun is actually vanilla ice cream~ also I got to say the ambience is spot. the dim light, upbeat music and placement of decor was inviting
4
Singaporeans are known to go out of their way to eat at the best eating places and this is another example although it's Spanish food that they serve and not food of the local variety. This little eatery is on one of the streets perpendicularly across the road from Central @Clarke Quay Mall. The food and service was great so we were not surprised this restaurant does well although it's not exactly on the riverside at Clarke Quay. Reservations is a must. We sent on a Thursday night and they were full all the way till after 9pm. We had the toasted bread with tomatoes, prawns in Ajillo Sauce and 2 "chef specials" on the board - the suckling pig paella and oxtail and for dessert the Spanish french toast and the dessert on the board (can't remember the name). All the good was great except the prawns was a little bit of a let down in comparison with the others.
4
We went as a family of 4 for dinner on a Friday evening. The food was delicious and service great. The only downside was that it was quite loud where we were sitting and hard to hear each other. If you have a chance ask to be seated away from the high tables! Otherwise, a great evening! Would highly recommend.
5
Charming place, cool staff and great food. Favorites were the anchovy with eggplant, mushroom croquettes and of course grilled pulpo. Make sure to get a reservation. Tables are scarce!
5
The food was on par with the offering in barcelona. Paella in particular was outstanding. Would return.
3
Squid ink paella was great as usual. Had the prawns, jamon and tomato bread, last two items actually paired up well together
4
Sharing portion tapas
Reservations recommended. Crowded even on weekdays . Good Bartenders, able to customise drinks specially for you .
5
Great, friendly staff, unbelievable food, cocktails and wine. Great place for couples or groups to meet and enjoy a wonderful night out.
5
Sometime in July 2016, we had a party of 6 for dinner at FOC. The reservation was very poorly handled when we were on site. However, FOC apologised after reviewing the matter and generously issued a dining voucher equivalent to the amount we spent that night.We are very happy to record that we used the voucher some 8 months later and had a very nice dinner and wine and service at FOC.The ambience was buzzing and the food and wine continued to shine.Well done FOC for your positive approach to solving problems that come from time to time
5
Went to FOC yesterday and we were delighted with the quality of the tapas and the elegant ambiance. We had the Octopus Galician Style, Grilled scallops with caviar, Pardon & Piquillo pepper plate, Black squid ink paella, Sucking pig terrine and for dessert we had Torrija French toast with homemade vanilla ice cream and Crema Catalana FOC style. It sounds like a lot but the portions are not that large. The black squid in paella and the suckling pig were our favorites. I never imagined that ice cream would go so well with the melt in your mouth pork.A little pricey so not an every day restaurant but well worth it overall
4
Went for a lunch with friends recently and really enjoyed the food and service. Everything was really tasty that we ordered and portions were as u would expect for tapas. Didn't give 5 stars as I thought 2 of the dishes were a little over-seasoned for my taste. Didn't try the wine or cocktails but the list looked good. Would defo go back as there was more to try and didn't even get near the puddings as we were too full :
5
Very friendly service staff who were eager to please and ensure a great dining experience.Culinary skills were just as amazing. Had the octopus and the pork ribs. Portion for the pork ribs was huge and could easily feed 2 people. Bread was a superb complement, with and without the tomato spread though the latter was one of the best I have tried both here and overseas.Good wine list too. What more could one ask for. Enjoy
5
delicious and authentic and well thought catalan tapas and more. from start to finish each course had the most fantastic flavours and textures.wine a little pricey but very high standard.ideal for fiends and casual business dinners for smaller parties if FOC only have bar seats
5
I love the food, the atmosphere, and the unique cocktails. The service is amazing too. The place is great for date or night out with colleagues.
5
Our first visit to the Hong Kong location. We will definitely be back. From the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Fab meal.
5
The service was great and the staff were forthcoming about your needs, requests. They even offered us kid's meals as we brought along the children for a Chinese New Year nights out.
Cheers.
4
Heard so much rave about FOC, even from my Spanish friends I definitely have to try them out. Certainly not disappointed from the wine to the food and the level of service. This makes one of my favourite Spanish restaurant in Singapore.
5
Made the reservation via Chope and FOC staff will double confirm the booking via text message and phone call. The food was excellent, real damn good. The staff were attentive as well. I would definitely return! Can't wait for my next visit to FOC!
5
Service is very good, they serve your dishes in order after you've finished your current dish so that the food stays warm and at its best. food is also well prepared for the tastes and pleasant to look at. Ambience is also fantastic
3
Chic ambience with a happening vibe to the place. but food was average, not quite what I expected after all the hype I've heard. Portions run small.
4
This is the 3rd time we have come to FOC and we always have a good experience. They have a good drinks menu and good wine selection. The food is lovely and it has a slight Asian twist. The oysters are always very good as are the scallops. The only thing that is disappointing is that the deserts are a bit averageâ€
5
Was already full house when we entered at 7pm. Noise level was relatively high. Music choice was awesome and it caught our attention. All service staffs are extremely attentive, had good product knowledge. Some of the dishes in the menu were a little foreign but the service staffs were able to explain it well. Food recommendations were also given. Tapas portions were perfect for 2 persons and was able to order around 5-6 dishes to share
4
First visit on the suggestion of my friend and the food did not disappoint. The food was good to match the quirky interior space.small venue of about 60 seats, chefs and kitchen staff were extremely busy but churned out the food fast. Mushroom croquettas were creamly and crispy at the same time. Not an easy feat to achieve. Paella chicken - not overly wet in texture and so delicious! Gambas alijilo- typical tapas dish , here larger shelled rawns were used. I would prefer the prawns to come without the shells. This was probably the least impressed dish of all. Specials of the day- barrumundi with egg plant was yummy. Fish was tasty , not salty at all and the mashed egg plant at the side gave it a new twist. Chocolate burger is a cute and creative white choc dessert. Must try! prices on menu were not extremely cheap but then again tapas in singapore are not cheap! We spent about sd 52 per person without alcohol. However, given the taste, quality and execution, i would say money well spent! Be sure to book ahead.
5
The food served here was of high quality and were very innovative. Service was even better, the staff were very attentive to our needs and could offer good recommendations!
5
Highly recommended! The overall dining experience for me and my bf was superb and we mark FOC as our favorite tapas bar!

Food was great, very yummy! Steak was awesome, done a perfect medium rare. Paella was excellent. Well worth it
5
I think this is best spanish food in singapore. Really love combination of food and cocktails. Price is also reasonable for the quality of food you are getting. The fact that you have to book in advance on weekdays is testament to quality of the restaurant.

Loved the chill ambiance, loved the cocktails (reminded me of the top notch New York bars) and enjoyed the food too. However, the next morning I had a nasty bout of food poisoning :( We ate a whole aquarium: octopus (excellent), shrimp (excellent), scallop (excellent) and oysters (meh- trying too hard to be fancy), so I don't know what caused it but I would guess it to be the oysters. Try at your own peril.

We ordered the bread with tomatoes and olive oil which was slightly toasted, a good start to the evening. Our next dish was the mushroom croquettes- it's amazing how this was nicely crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside, superbly done! Our next dish was the sautéed cauliflower with pine nuts and spring onions, this was a unique taste. Never tasted cauliflower this way, excellent rendition. The next was the Octopus Galician style -Slow Cooked & Charcoal Grilled. While the octopus was OK it sat on a bed of mash potatoes. This dish didn't really rock me. Our last small plate was Prawns in “Ajillo” sauce (Garlic & White Wine). This had a wonderful aroma and the prawns were good. Pity we didn't have any bread to dip into the gravy as it was really yummy! Our next dish was Paella. We had the Cuttlefish & Saffron Paella with Scampi. While the cuttlefish tasted OK, the scampi turned out a bit soggy. The dish overall was still good, but could have been better if the scampi wasn't overcooked? Lastly we had the Grilled “Chuleta” Beef Steak with garnish. The beef was very nicely done, succulent and done just right. For desserts, we had Crema Catalana” FOC Style, the Chocolate Galaxy and the Flaming Rum Baba with Chantilly Ice Cream. The first was a Spanish version of Creme Brûlée, the second was a kind of chocolate cake while the last dessert was very interesting. The waiter comes with a flaming pot of rum and pours out the rum right on your table! One of my group of 4 had a cocktail and the rest of us just had water. The cocktail was $22. Our total bill came to $214. Reasonable for a TOP end tapas restaurant. Definitely worth a visit.

A nice Bar and Restauant with a very good performance in the (front cooking) kitchen with a very good service. It`s an individual special spanish-oriented menu and the food looked and was very tasty. The service was fast and always friendly. We`ve been very pleased for this evening in this Bar/Restaurant
5
Had dinner at FOC restaurant on the 31st December, which was my second year anniversary with my girlfriend. The staff was attentive and offered suggestions as we were new to spanish fare. The restaurant also provided a complimentary celebratory cake even though I had not specifically requested for it. We were very satisfied with the meal and will return another time to try the suckling pig paella
5
Best Spanish food in town! This is probably my fifth visit to FOC and they have remained consistent. The food is out of the world and service was top notch. The bruschetta and Jamon is a must order and I can pretty much let the servers do the recommendation. I know that I'm in save hands. Awesome Spanish wine list and definitely have a few cocktails. They are amazing! Looking forward to my next visit already!
5
The food was fantastic, especially the ham and mushroom croquettes as well as the "Xapadillo" Eel and Pork Belly tapas. We had the Manchego cheese platter to, which was lovely. Big shout out to Qyera for being such an attentive and patient server, and for all the delicious food recommendations
4
I tried the grilled octopus, scallops with cavier, paella and beef cheek with truffle. All the dishes are nice.
Will come again.
4
Food is good but we find the squid ink paella and mushroom croquettes quite salty. Service is great too!
4
Food is delicious but quantities are a bit small and it is overpriced. For example, looking at the price of the steak I expected to take more than two bites.
The atmosphere is nice and the decoration of the place is very cool.
5
The food here is always good and well prepared. Service is excellent too. I've never had a bad visit to foc.
4
This restaurant food is good, had the morning brunch. It was nice and the food was tasty, but the morning brunch can be considered quite pricey. Nevertheless the service was good!
5
Service is good asthe staff are very attentive when we are seated at the counter seat. Food are fabulous
3
Patatas bravas was amazing, watermelon gazpacho was very good but other dishes were average. Expected more for the price
5
Birthday cake gift by the restaurant during my visit really surprised us. Just simply type for birthday celebration while booking online.

I don't know. I used to love this place and went all the time. Fast forward a year and it just doesn't seem the same. We had two waiters for our table, the male was very good but he was spread out too thin with too many tables. The girl was not good and I had to constantly call her over to pour wine and get our food. Food took way too long to come. It was good, but not in the 'great' category anymore. Wine is always good but I have a problem with paying those prices for Spanish wine......to get something decent its going to cost you a minimum of $160 a bottle.I have seen many great restaurants then open more locations and that turns out to be the death of them. Hopefully this will not be one of them
4
Had some tapas to share with a group of 3. Overall they were quite good. Portions ok to get a good taste but not stuff yourself (which is not my style anyway). Chef stopped by the table to check if all was ok and had a bit of a chat with us. He did it in a nice, professional way without being 'too much' or obtrusive. All in all a good experience and I will definitely return to get another taste
4
Wonderful choice for anniversary! Great ambience, Valuable food plus nice presentation. Wine selection could be much more though.
5
Great cocktails. Inventive tapas and reasonable prices keep a lot of people coming back to this place. Decor and ambience is also great without the stuffiness of most restaurants. Its a place where you share with the ones you love. Recommended.
5
I visited this place the first time on my birthday. Reservation is recommended.Michelin-Starred Chef restaurant. Service was good except for the new staff who doesnt seem to know what to do. The cuttlefish scampi paella was excellent. Greatly recommend it. The seafood was fresh. The burnt risotto was cooked perfectly and the food was savouring. The scallop with caviar was cooked to perfection. Will return again for sure 
4
I was searching for a nice place to have dinner during our weekend in Singapore and I found this one online. It was recommended to we decided to give it a try.We arrived quite early, at around 6:30PM and was seated at the bar which was quite convenient. I had the pisco sour which reminded me of Peru and Chile which was enjoyable.We then continued on to the food where the tapas portions were in a descent size for a tapas's. The food was very good and tasty, but was full with salt, I guess the cook is in-love, and hence why I gave it only 4 stars.Other then that all was well and the atmosphere and service were top notch
4
Cool vibes and ideal for catch-up with a small group of friends over some light tapas and drinks. Would head back for their scrambled egg and beef cheek sliders tapas as well as some drinks (haven't gotten to try but would try the next time I'm there). Awesome service too.
4
Good food and good service. The down side is that these are tapas that are charged at high prices. Folks from Spain must go how gullible are Singaporean's! Wine list is extensive but also overpriced with only one or two reasonable priced wines. We enjoyed the night - our third visit but they must be making money hand over fist. The menu has not changed for a Long time either
5
Dining here is a great way to start the weekend. The fun, loud and bustling atmosphere reminds me of the tapas bars in Spain and definitely gears you up for the next spot. Food was of excellent quality and I suppose justifies the price - we had mushroom croquettes, padron peppers, bacalao fritters, gambas, beef cheek sliders and lamb chops, with a nice bottle of wine. The night in Rios cocktail was so delicious - the whole glass was dusted with cinnamon so you taste a bit of cinnamon with every sip. Dessert of crema catalana and their daily special of coffee-flavoured cream with meringue, coffee croutons and caramelized nuts were a nice finish. Definitely on my go back again list
1
I was told that this is a happening restaurant so I made reservation the week before but when we arrived we were sat toward the end edge of the bar where the cashier was, anyways we were excited to try the dishes so we didn't let it bother us. We started by ordering 4 dishes that were recommended and planned to order more as we go along. The first dish was jamon croquette which was disappointing, 2nd dish was the octopus it wasn't bad but nothing special(i have had much better), 3rd the beef sliders, Not my favourite. 4th, the scallop, this is the only dish that tasted nice. I live in Europe for a few years, I wouldn't call this good spanish food. I was surprised to see the sign that the restaurant was supposed to be a catalan cuisine with a michelin chef behind it
4
Initially wanted the $40 set lunch but the chef not flexible on swopping dishes. So a la carte it wasSat at the counter which i prefer. Tables are too close to each other anywayThe mushroom croquettes were good, as was the scrambled eggs with chorizo and potatoes. The seafood paella was too salty , almost life threatening. The ibericio pork was goodService was pleasan
5
For our party of 2 who have both visited Spain before, we both felt the food was authentic in taste, texture and presentation. The Crema Cataluna did have a FOC twist to it which was refreshing! The service was attentive and atmosphere lively, much like an experience in the bars at Barcelona. If I may have 1 gripe, it would be the slightly pricey levels set for the tapas. Paellas however, was reasonably priced. Well done
5
Amazing food and cocktail! We sat at the counter seats and the staff was really friendly and one of our best meals!
5
The best tapas we've come across in Singapore and a great setting for a romantic meal for 2. Prices were steep but not unreasonable
4
foc is one of our favorite places in Singapore for Spanish food. We love atmosphere and the food there. I do not give a 5 for 2 reasons: -wine list : a large selection of Spanish wines but pricing is too expensive. Most of wines are at 130$+- fat: lots of dishes are really fat and oily. I know it is Spanish food but still. Overall great restaurant highly recommende
5
We had a dinner with 10 people and truly enjoyed the evening. First having a drink outside at the terrace and then tasting through the great tapas menu, sitting at the high table. The open kitchen, good lighting, fast and friendly service made it en excellent experience. It's certainly a great place to go for all different occasions and the are open on Sundays!We will come again!
5
FOC, despite the slight increase in prices, is still a gem for great food and service. We couldn't stop eating the roasted cauliflower and octopus, and the bacalao balls with green apple puree hit just the right balance between sweet and salty. While it's not the most flavourful of places, it's comfort food and consistent, which I appreciate
4
The service was relatively good for a Sentosa beach restaurant and it was not too crowded. We really like the fish and chips thanks to the amazing homemade fries and fresh fishes. However, the paella was just overpriced rice. Don't go for the Paella but stick to tapas! Plus it is conveniently located near a taxi stand and the vibe was good. Very family friendly with lots of kids
4
This was our second visit and I was eager to order their signature cocktail - the Bloody Jordi again. Alas, it was off the menu that night as some of the ingredients hadn't arrived in time. We ordered Sangria and another spicy cocktail instead. But really, nothing quite compares to their signature cocktail, which is a must try if you like your drinks savoury! The squid ink paella was divine. The cod fish, done sous vide style and flash fried for a crispy finish, did not bedazzle - we felt the fish was a little over fried and dry tasting. Their angus beef cannelloni was well executed and very enjoyable. There was a hiccup with the redemption of our Chope voucher at the restaurant. Somehow, it was invalid and we could not use it. Overall, the service was still very good and the food and cocktails don't disappoint either.
4
There were 5 of us so we were able to order many dishes to share. I would say the majority of the dishes were very good.. only 1 or 2 we didnt like iti too much. Overall a very good tapas place and we would definitely go back again
5
This is one of those rare times where I'm doing a rating. I really like how quirky the restaurant is with huge head figurines. We were warmly greeted by the waitresses (which you can't really find that sort of service in SG), and got our seat. Thank god we made a reservation because the place was packed! Food was served pretty quickly, and omg the taste was brilliant! I'm never a fan of croquette all my life but the ones they served were a life-changer. It was SOOOOO good! The rest of the dish were tasty as well but the croquette's definitely worth a mention. Service was excellent and everyone was polite and nice. It can be slightly pricey but it was worth it.
4
Food is good. We had scallop which is amazing, scramble egg with potato and grilled beef steak which are very good, octopus & mushroom croquette which are good. I love the simple but very good Spanish pepper too. On top of that, service is top! Overall, it's a restaurant with quality food, good service and lively vibe.
5
Celebrated my best friend's birthday with her at FOC. We really enjoyed the food and service. Really friendly staff around too. I'm definitely coming back! ;)
1
It's quite a common feature for an establishment to garner a reputation via many forms however this chophouse falls catastrophically..
It's awful personnel and equally uninspired chow made for a most unpleasant experience...
5
Celebrated my birthday at FOC, we cannot love this restaurant any more, food and special-engineered cocktails are really exquisite. Will definitely come back again.
3
Menu was so-so and a bit pricey. Wine by the glass was too expensive for the quality. Service staff was helpful but a bit pushy.
5
My husband and I got a few appetizers and the squid ink paella to share. The mushroom croquettes was delightful. The seared pork special for that evening was also very delicious. We got the Bangkok cocktail which was on the smaller side but good anyhow
4
Among top tapas restaurants in Singapore...good selection of seafood meats vegetables plates. Wide range of paellas and spanish wines. Service staff knowledgeable and attentive. Well recommended.
3
Good friendly service but it was too noisy. Tables were placed so close we could hear the table conversations v clearly on either side. Food was average and portions so small we went to another place for second round.
3
Im still trying to find a good Spanish restaurant in Singapore, I love Spanish food and especially northern Spanish Basque and Catalonian cuisine so was very excited when I read about FOC, I turn up full of hope..... I was disappointed.We went at lunchtime and we ordered a lot of dishes, there were a few standouts, the eel and pork belly was amazing and the lamb cutlets outstanding... They were to be fair both excellent.The rest was so so, could have been anywhere and we had the Pork ribs that were more fat than Pork and were very disappointing. The breakfast egg dish (so well done elsewhere!!!) was awful, the scallops were OK.The problems here really was the price per portion ratio doesn't reflect well, each dish is 20-30 dollars and is tiny.... Really tiny I am a fan of tapes and pintxos but this is crazy small.The service is also off... not bad as they are super attentive almost to much every 2 minutes they were turning up doing something at the table, it was lunchtime and fairly quiet but they need to get their balance right.At 430 dollars for 3 for lunch with only one bottle of wine I expect more and FOC does not deliver. I am going to give it another go in the evening but otherwise the search for good Spanish in Singapore continues!!
2
The food serve fast, and very quickly they will remove even you have not finish it. I feel they are just rushing out and hope to clear it fast for the next customer. I need to stop them from removing the plates when we have my mashed on it. The mashed potates is just for decoration, not for consumption?When we almost finished our dinner, when we take turns to go to the restroom, I was asked if we like to have desserts 3 times in less than 10 mins!!! Probably they just cannot accept an answer NO. The whole dining experience was spoilt by their service.Ham croquettes and mushroom croquettes is pretty good.Suckling Pig is terrible! They have bad selection on the pork and it gives off a distinct porky smell.Prawns is not even fresh, their heads is struggling to stick on their bodies.:Xapadillo" Eel & Pork belly presentation looks nicer than the food itself.Grilled Iberico Pork Ribs is decent but too much of fats that make this dish unpalatable.Squid Ink Paella is too wet.Cocktail is good tooAnd yes, the Sangria is the worst I ever had.This is definitely not a highend restaurant, average restaurant price slightly on the higher side.Overall not my preferred spanish restaurant. Will not mind to come for the cocktail.2 Star for the settings
5
Fantastic tapas restaurant - I can't wait to go again! Wide range of unusual tapas along with old favourites. The octopus in particular was really good. Great cocktail and wine list. As with everywhere any good in Singapore it's a the pricey end of things but worth it! Lively atmosphere and lovely service
4
In average it was good, but the things was little bit salty. But the things was quite special. Will go next time.
5
The “Ibérico” ham (Jamón ibérico) and Toasted Bread with Tomatoes (Pa smb tomàquet) was out of this world! The Grilled “Chuleta” Beef Steak with garnish was succulent and juicy. And the Spanish “French Toast” was indeed memorable! It was a fun and beautiful experience!
5
Service and food quality are always consistent! Definitely one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore and for sure the best Spanish food you can get here.
4
Went to FOC for my wife's birthday and we had a great time. Nice decor, music and general vibe. Food and drinks menus were quite nice. Reminded us of our visit to Barcelona.
5
We love FOC and look forward to trying their Sentosa branch and Orchard branch coming soon! I heard they will have more seafood in Sentosa and more casual tapas in Orchard. Both with some signature dishes!
5
It was a while since my last "comida Española" (in Spain of course) and thanks to my catalán friend I discovered this great restaurant. Food is great, the place is very nice and the whole team is really outstanding. Care for details and quality seen "live". Juan José (Head Chef) is constantly checking that your food is the top in town. The valencia/culé chef gives you a mix of passion and professional. You can't miss it.Volveré hasta que puedo para disfrutar una excelente comida Española
5
The atmosphere started when we entered - lights were out! But the lights being out didn't deter the staff from making the evening something to remember. We tried about 8 of the tapas and each was outstanding. Highly recommend the Watermelon gazpacho and patatas bravas and the mushroom croquettes. But honestly all were great. We finished with the French toast...wow. Thanks
5
I loved the selection and creativity behind all of the tapas. We sat at the bar and could see the chef and cooks prepare the tapas right there which also enhanced the whole dining experience. The pork belly and ice cream dish was to die for
5
Visited here with my girlfriend on a one night stop over back to the UK (25 y/o). Food was great and tasted my favorite cocktail ever (the sour one!). However nothing tops the attentive, friendly and classy staff. We sat at the bar.Have also been prompted to comment on the 'french toast' desert. Which was 'a perfect blend of cosy tastes, a balanced texture and leaves a delicious taste in the mouth'Highly recommended
4
After reading rave reviews about FOC, my partner and I had to try this restaurant whilst in Singapore. The service was amazing - very friendly, informative and prompt. The food was delicious - we had the mushroom croquettes, ham croquettes, chicken paella, beef cheek sliders, scramble before you eat egg, bacon and chorizo and not to mention the tasty magnum cheesecake for dessert. The cocktails were also good - highly recommend the Madame butterfly.
5
Really great tapas in a cool place close to Clarke quay. Have been a few times and its always fantastic food served by knowledgable staff. The croquettes are the star dish
5
The food cuality is amazing, very tasty. The dessert are very surprised The only thing is the music is a bit high.
5
Third or forth visit here, always good. Black ink squid paella, pork ribs and padron peppers are favourites. Shared tables can be interesting but u normally get ur own space.
Well worth a visit
4
Nice selection of catalan food with particular view of Jubany. Food excellent. Portions not abundant. Extensive wine list. QUite noisy when corporate groups were celebrating.
4
very nice tapas restaurant with a very good decoration , great dishes nicely cooked, very professional chef and staff.
4
Taken there for lunch by a good friend today. Very exquisite and fine cooking. We ordered the Mushroom Croquettes and bcos there were only 3 of us and 4 croquettes to a serve, the waiter was so perceptive and offered to prepare 3 Mushroom Croquettes and 3 Ham Croquettes so that we have a wider spread of flavours. Although this should be intuitive but you will be hard pressed to find them nowadays. Well done. Mushroom and Ham Croquettes were excellent. Have not eaten better. The batter was just right and blanded perfectly with the stuffing. The Black Squid Ink paella was good but I find it a tinge too saltish. However I like the way how the rice was nicely but slightly burnt and chewy. Next time I will ask for a wedge of lemon to squeeze the juice onto the rice if it would bring out a bit more of the seafood flavours. Our next dish was the Octopus Galician. Octopus was tender and the cooking was perfectly judged but mildly flavoured. May be better if it was grilled a bit more for the charcoal character to come more to the fore. The absolute best dish must be the Iberico Grilled Pork Ribs! Perfectly bbq and yet the meat was super tender. The distinctive fragrant of the bbq pork was ever present but not overpowering. As a testament of how good it was, my friend cum host did not decline a second helping despite being a small eater! To steal an adage from an old advertisement, you can walk a mile for a Camel, one can certainly walk many miles for the Iberico Bbq Pork Ribs, and you would probably need to walk again after the meal! Eaten too much to try desserts but was pleasantly surprised the bar stocked a bottle of Ardbeg 10 Islay Whisky! Perfect with a cube of ice and coffee latte. Only downside was the coffee. The choice of roasting and strength may need some attention. Will recommend this highly. 4.5/5
4
This was my second visit to FOC. The menu has a variety of the usual Tapas dishes like croquette, paella which are well done. The croquette is filled with piping hot mushroom and they melt in your mouth. The squid ink paella is moist and flavorful. Cork tail menu is indeed refreshing. We also ordered a special item of the day, iberico pork collar but the meat was tough which we feed back to the manager. Before we called for the bill, the manager gracefully waived the cost of this dish. Very nice gesture of FOC. I love the busy and care free atmosphere. Everyone seems to be having a good time including the chefs.
5
We have been here a couple of times already and we will go back many times for sure. Absolutely stunning tapas, some of them are just divine. Really really great tasting food and wines. Helpful staff as well and always packed so make a reservation or you won'te get in. Looking forward to my next visit
4
The staff are knowledgeble. They are very attentative & know all items listed on the menu. Can't really go wrong with their recommendation. You can also challenge them to create cocktail according to your preference. They also prepared a surprise small birthday brownie when i indicate that i'm celebrating birthday for my friend.
3
Food was ok, but again this is one of the only two Spanish restaurant in singapore i visited. My third time here. Staff are knowledgeable, but because it is divided into two sitting so everything seems rush. Overall experience is still ok, price is a little high.
4
we liked the tapas and the paella; the service was very friendly and the location is trendy. we will come back...
5
I´ve been there several times, both table and counter are perfect places, maybe for me is more special the counter because it allows you to see the chefs cooking.
4
great good, nice ambience, and generally very attentive service. lots of unique drinks at the bar counter.
5
We had an excellent evening at FOC. Luckily we were placed at the counter table which is, for a couple, the best option. You can enjoy the show and the enthusiasm of the crew who are doing an excellent job. Very lively place with great food. 
5
Awesome experience. Very Friendly staff and great food , especially the squid ink paella !Sitting by the cocktail area , allows you to feel the hip, and energy from the bartenders which sets the absolute lovely evening , with a glass of cocktail of course !
4
We came here as a couple last month and were seated at the high table with 10 other diners we didn't know - it's a novel dining concept if you're after a casual dining experience with friends but ask for a more private table if you're looking for something more intimate.I really enjoyed the Patatas Bravas FOC Style which was unlike any patatas bravas I've had - it was very crisp and reminded me of Heston Blumenthal's triple cooked chips but with a dollop of tomato and mayonnaise for added interest. The other winner was the Grilled Scallops with Soy Caviar & Bonito stock - the scallops were really fresh and tender - it is so easy to overcook scallops but these were done perfectly.We also had the Prawns in “Ajillo” sauce, Octopus Galician style, Foie Gras Terrine and the Flaming Rum Baba for dessert. I didn't find any of these dishes awe-inspiring and would not order them again. We spent about S$200 between us with a few glasses of wine. I would come back for the patatas bravas and the scallops
5
I came to FOC for dinner with my husband and our Friend. Our friend was running a little late however the staff were not pushy when we said we were waiting for our friend. Our friend was actually quite late, so my husband and I started with nice cocktails and a few nibbles which was very lovely. When our friend came we ordered more dishes and they were quite fast in bring out the different dishes. Atmosphere, was funky and modern without being pretentious. I would recommend coming with a few people so you can try a few more different dishes, but it would also be a great place for a date night. The only disappointing part was the dessert, they all had theatrics but the flavour just did not match up to the dinner
5
It was our mates birthday and we wanted to surprise her with a place with good food, drinks and atmosphere. Lively and unpretentious suits us, we had a reservation and was well attended by the staff (thank you!). Got attended by Riduo who is an awesome host, he knows what to recommend and gave us stories of the brand! I appreciate knowledge like that as it shows the passion of the company and employees who take pride in their work! Hard to come by these days. Food was served warm and plated beautifully, it came in a timely fashion so we get to try a variety! The scampi paella is SO good, the crunch in the rice made it standout; the octopus is juicy and tasty; beef is made well and portions are perfect. Every tapas item is good! Cocktails and Spanish sparkling white filled our tummy quickly - please try the Gin Spirit, Cinderella, Naughty Daddy and Stairway to Heaven! Makes your head spin and voice go louder shortly. FOC was so kind to prepare a cake for my mate so it ended on a sweeeeet note x Thank you for making our evening so memorable Jay 2 (Day Two) and partner bartender! Look forward to the next
5
The service was impeccable and the staff was very knowledgeable about the food and wine. The food was just fantastic and with great pricing. The albarino was superb. All the tapas was very good especially the grilled octopus and the squid ink paella. Highly recommend if you want great spanish food and ambience. Cocktails looked amazing but didn't try.
5
It was a crowded night and only the counter seats were available. Staff was very helpful in trying to get a table seat for me but unfortunately all was booked, and also in food recommendation.Had the small plates and all were fantastic! The Gilda Skewer with anchovy, olives and smoked sea bass was refreshing and very appetising. Had their signature Coca, which is a kind of toasted bread, topped with anchiovies, grilled peppers and cheese in spherical shapes! Two bite size portions that was just nice. Something heartier was the crispy Xapadillo eel and pork belly with a soft poached egg that you had to mix together or dip in as you wish. Love the cracking in the mouth!The cocktails was smooth and easy drinking, of which I had the Churchhill Old Fashioned and Good Old Diplomatic Pal
4
One of the best service we have received since being in Singapore
Barmen and chefs were obviously very passionate about their jobs making great cocktails and food
Decor was very trendy with a young and hip vibe
Loved it and would highly recommend
5
Awesome atmosphere and friendly staff. We sat up at the bar, really awesome to watch the staff in the kitchen and at the pass. Must get the OCTOPUS it was sensationally tender. Thanks guys!!
4
Food was above avg esp. for the squid ink paella. Staff was attentive and the place is rather child friendly with baby chairs and utensils readily available.
5
We always have a great meal at the FOC. Sitting at the bar we could follow every step of the preparation of our food by the chef. What a great experience. Very smart combinations of ingredients and a great presentation. The price is reasonable.
4
good selection of tapas and drinks(esp the sangrias). excellent service from the waiters. dessert was a plus, value for money.
5
Dinner for 2 The restaurant is located on the first floor of a old shop house. A nice long counter surrounds the open concept kitchen. Tastefully decorated and has a nice vibe. Staff and service here is above average. Friendly and attentive. The cocktails are pretty good. Quite a few on the menu and most are interesting concoctions. Food. We had quite a few tapas. And not a single one was disappointing. The squid ink paella was good and recommended. Overall. Great place for a social dinner. I enjoyed the counter and watch the chefs in action but there are normals seats available. I'll definitely be returning to this restaurant.
5
I've been a fan of the head chef (Jordi Noguera) and have been following his career since I first came to try his food at Foodbar DaDa. Now that he is under the banner of Nandu Jubany (one of the most respected chef in Spain), make FOC a no-brainer for any lover of Spanish cuisine. I dare say that this is the best tapas bar in the Australasia region.Everything on their menu is really praise worthy and their cocktails menu is equally inspired
5
This restaurant was recommended by a friend and was surely worth a trip. We had to book ahead as even on a Monday night they were very busy. Restaurant itself is very cool and all the dishes were very tasty! I would highly recommend the octopus and chocolate burger! YAM!!
4
We went there and ate at the bar really good tapas! The gaspacho with pasteque, melon and olive ice cream was excellent and every tapas we ordered were amazing! Simple well cooked with good Spanish flavors....hummmm loved it.Good wine list and large choice of cocktails. Definitely a place where we will go back soo
5
It was already late when my friends and I tried this famous Spanish restaurant.I guess they're nearly closing that night and everybody was busy cleaning except for the lovely philippine lady who noticed us and left what she was doing just to assist us.She hurriedly let us sit and ask if we want to try their desserts (the only food available that time and kitchen is closing).She seemed worried if we were hungry and asked if we wanted to grab some bites before we drink (very much appreciated).The service was so honest and exceptional.She gave extra effort to explain the desserts in details (so amazing!).She always kept her eyes to us even though she was doing something.She made sure that we had full glass of water and comfortable.Their cocktail drinks were fine too!I really like this place and I should give a five star rate for the service!Btw we ate chocolate galaxy,chocolate burger and french toast. Awesome desserts that makes me want to come back again soon
5
It was not our first time at FOC. As before it didn't disappoint us. Excellent food and spotless service. It's manager, Carmen, does an amazing job.
4
Enjoyed the experience! One of my favorite finds and place to chill out. Would surely revisit again.
5
Taste of food is fantastic
Staff are attentive
Ambience is great
Popular with diners; need to reserve in advance
5
Went to FOC with 20 colleagues. The only reason I mention the number is because the service was exceptional for a group of this size. We had a Tapas banquet which was yummy from the first dish all the way to the deserts. My highlights where the mushroom croquets and the Squid ink paella. The deserts where to die for! Great ambiance, great environment. Would not hesitate to go back when I'm next in SG

Place is really popular and almost always packed, recommend making a reservation in advance if you plan to visit. Vibe is very hip, and honestly the best seats are at the bar itself.We liked best the gazpacho, mushroom croquettes, squid ink paella. Dessert options are great but overly sweet. Avoid the cod fish fritters: the inside is an odd, stodgy, concoction inside that sticks everywhere in your mouth. Seriously dodgy texture. Some tapas are fantastic while some need some more work (and serving size adjustment). Prices are honestly a bit off. Wine list is solid but we went for cocktails. These are expertly made, and with a cocktail menu that is essentially a book: there will be something for you. Service is very warm, knowledgeable and prompt; some of the better we've found in Singapore

Invited here by a friend who has lived in Singapore for six years this restaurant was alive and kicking by 7.00 pm. We settled at the bar (great for watching the chefs in action!) with a beautiful cocktail (Stairway to Heaven...well named) and ordered widely (with the expert assistance of a cheerful staffmember). All choices were excellent. My fav was bread with tomato topped with Iberico ham, not cheap but o so good. My partners was Ink Squid paella and my friend loved the Galician style octopus. Come to think of it, that was my fav, too. I'm fickle! I wasn't too keen on the desserts (too sweet for me but my partner just loved the Chocolate Galaxy). Booking is advisable for groups 4 and over and I don't think you can book for any less than 3. It gets very crowded but the food keeps coming. Service is fantastic. The kitchen is a well oiled machine, so to speak. I know, I watched them .... fascinated
4
So I had been trying for a while to get reservations here but it's always difficult. We finally made it at 6.15pm. Place was hip with sharing tables. Music hip so great: they have this sharing table concept which does seem strange as it means we seem to be eating with strangers food was good. Tapas style
4
This was our second visit to FOC, and we enjoyed it just as much. The various tapas are delicious. The croquettes and basically anything cheesy are a winner. Like the first time, the highlights of the meal is the squid ink paella and the desserts (any of them).
3
Touted as a top tapas Restn in singapore. The success FOC has is well deserved as food n wine and most service is good. Success sometimes translates to arrogance. We booked on Chope for 6pax. We turned up at 7 approx and were told that our reservation is gone as we did not respond to the Sms they sent to recon the Resvn. We had asked them when and what number did they call or Sms to. Turned out FOC dialed another number. The front line staff were quite nonchalant and all prepared or turn us away. Realizing their Fault they found us a table. Not ONE word of apology. It costs NOTHING to say ' sorry' for the error. Food was mostly good and wine too. A very poor showing for a Restn which we understand is opening 2 other locations. Perhaps they think their success and popularity will allow some of their staff to act the way they did
4
Great tapas in a lively environment. We ordered the bread with tomato, jamon, patatas bravas, mushroom croquettes and jamon croquettes plus cheese and lemon pie for dessert. Portions were quite small but otherwise all dishes were very good. Service was excellent - for example when we ordered the jamon croquettes having already ordered the jamon we were offered the choice of having half jamon and half mushroom. This worked out perfectly for us as my wife doesn't eat meat.Doesn't get a 5 because of the prices. The dishes above plus one of the cheapest bottles of wine cost $200
5
bar seats are the best way to go if it's just the two of you - amazing food and impeccable service that isn't pushy or overbearing. Definitely coming back for more!
5
Highly reccomend real Spanish cuisine with a touch of creativity .... Fresh clean and good wines selection . Chef Jordy make all this possible !!! Ask him for what s hot in the menu '.
Bravo!!! Floor staff very helpful manager and waitresse .
5
Food was delish. Portion was surprising large, sufficient for 4 people. Service staff was attentive and friendly.
5
The food at Foc was good, and decently priced. The cocktail menu was also impressive. I'll be sure to return.
5
So much fun to be seated at the bar and watch all the activity in the kitchen. Service is amazing +++ and food just devine. We're coming back soon!!!
4
The location was easy to find. The food is tasty and nicely presented. The drinks however were very diluted.
3
This is the first Spanish restaurant I've visited in Singapore and I wasn't disappointed but not that excited either. The Patatas bravas are great though, definitely the stand out dish. The paella with pork belly and scallops was under seasoned for my taste. The eels and pork belly were not that interesting. The octopus with cauliflower purée was very good. Cocktails are delicious and fairly priced. Sadly the desserts were uninteresting, possibly the worst tarte tatin I've ever had, completely missing the doughy part that would be expected. Hamburger chocolate was cute to look at but again the taste was at best mediocre. All in all a mixed bag.
5
Normally I don't write about every restaurant I visit but last night's dinner was really amazing. The special on the board was suckling pig/scallop paella it was amazing succulent, tasty etc etc..The rest of the food was just as fantastic along with the wine/service décor of the place. Loved it, will be back for mor
5
I visited here with some friends having heard great things about the restaurant and it certainly lived up to its reputation. The service was great and the waiter could not have been any more helpful with one person in the party having to fulfil certain dietary requirements. She was not made to feel awkward and all the dishes were clearly explained to her and they were happy to accommodate her requests. It was tough choosing what to eat as the food all looked delicious - we even asked other guests what they had ordered as dish after dish came out that looked mouthwatering. The cod croquettes, the cauliflower, padron peppers, pork rib and beef were all amazing. The flavours all worked so well and the dishes were well thought out. The atmosphere was also great - very relaxed and lively. It had a very european feel to it and you didn't feel you were in Singapore (which is good for a Spanish restaurant!). The wines were great and the waiter was very helpful is guiding us to choose. Overall, it was a really great evening and a place I will definitely recommend and visit again
3
The restaurant is very busy and happening with a nice buzz about it. Decor is interesting. Cocktail menu is vast and there is a good selection of tapas. Prices are very high though, ordered the open tortilla and it was $20+ for a very small portion (even by tapas standards) also tried the squid ink paella, which was good but seemed gelatinous and gloopy after a few mouthfuls texture-wise. I ordered the 'Cinderella's Potion' cocktail and it was delicious and refreshing. It didn't turn me into a princess though and the price at the end made me feel more like I was back in rags by the fireplace
4
Very good food with good service. Only downside is time limit due to 2 sittings, especially when coming with larger group. You will end up being rushed... Definitely worthwhile visit
5
The only downside would be the time limit since there were 2 sittings and it may feel like you are being rushed.
5
Food was hot and nicely plated, food quality was there, service was there. Great atmosphere too. Will be back again
5
We had an amazing dinner at FOC last week. The perfect cooked catalan food kept surprising us and brought back great memories from living in Barcelona. great atmosphere and music.
Will definitely recommend it to all my friends that will visit singapore
4
Been to FOC a few times now, most recently to try their weekend brunch. Everything we tried from the cauliflower to pork ribs was delicious and cooked to perfection. They serve awesome tapas, drinks and desserts bundled with fabulous and prompt service.
5
Awesome tapas. Make sure you order the octopus, the iberico ribs. Bring a crowd so that you can try more dishes.
4
tapas and good wine but lacks in service and ambience, very poor lightings so unable to see menu or food.
5
If one must eat Spanish, first that comes to mind is FOC. It was hard to get a table, but my friend did on a Friday night. It was packed and had the vibe of a popular tapas joint in Barcelona. Introduction of the menu was rushed but understandable since they were busy.Food was authentic and we enjoyed them. Galician octopus served on a wooden board had a bit of Japanese touch, but it was great. The beef burger was cute and dainty.Friend requested for a dessert called galaxy but it wasn't on the menu anymore. Server recommended he chocolate burger and we tried it. Haha, what a surprise...it looked literally like a burger
4
Went a few times. Great food, ambiance and wine in the same location. Service is excellent too. Went to Spain last years and trust me, this place can be much better than some of the cities we had in Spain. It's a comparative standard with the ones we had in Barcelona. Do remb to make yr reservation way before the actual day to secure your seats
4
Finally I can say there's a real spanish restaurant in Singapore that is serving true casual food in 'racion' style... basically tapas X 3. And more fun and elaborate ones at that. The challenge with simple Spanish food is that many times it doesnt translate properly outside of Spain (unless it is the jamones, chorizos and cheeses). FOC has been able to bring catalan cuisine and dishes from some other regions like Galicia into fun, sharing plates that help discover the deeper flavors of Spain that people didnt know about.FOCs menu is incredibly intelligent in that it offers large sections for both cold and hot tapas, which is -at the end of the day, how most Spanish people like to eat. They range properly in complexity and price points but making assured that ingredients used in each case are of top notch quality and authenticity.Drinks are very fun as well and the wine list gingerly selected. Fun mod ambience. Try to get a table by the 'barra' so you can get to see all the action.Service was excellent and incredibly attentive
5
All the dishes we ordered were delicious but the Presa Iberia and the croquetas were memorable! Service was great. Cocktails were good. Will come back!
4
Had a great meal at FOC with friends, good service, tapas with a twist, and ambience. Particularly like the decor!
3
Nice interior, good presentation. Food quality okay, food quantity disappointing. Service was slightly slow and waitress didn't understand the dish she was selling...
Nice to try but wouldn't return here.
5
Service was attentive and very reactive to our needs. No prompts required to top up our water and cutleries and plates was changed at appropriate timings. Food is fantastic and certainly not run of the mill although the price is on the higher end.
5
The food was amazing~people over there were very friendly~Hope I can get some drinks there next time..must be fantastic as well~
4
Great menu with good varieties from seafood, veggie to meats and delivered to satisfaction. Unfortunately, the restaurant expected to churn the table in 2 hours regardless we kept ordering.
5
Long story short: we went there for the fourth time, had all together 10 tapas and 2 desserts and again it didn't disappoint. Some of the tapas are divine (ham croquettes, patatas bravas, squid, scallops, tortilla) and both desserts were very good as well. The crema catalana FOC style is impressive and tasted as good as last time. Fully booked and there's a reason why. Will surely go here again!
4
This place was 1 out of 3 Catalan restaurants recommended by my Spanish boss and it was probably 1 of the best recommendations! I was in a group of 7 and we tried a big variety of food. There were a lot more hits than misses and here's my list: HITS: patatas bravas, mushroom croquettes, cod fish fritters, pimientos, sautéed cauliflower, octopus, pork, French toast, chocolate galaxy (mini chou puff with melting chocolate)MISSES: gambas, special of the day (mackerel), chocolate burger, crema catalayanOverall, my foodie friends and I were very happy with the food standards and enjoyed the dinner thoroughly. Service was excellent with a vibrant and lively atmosphere. I will definitely return and can't wait to share this hidden gem with more friends.
1
Just went to a Spanish tapas place that people has always raved about: FOC. Honestly, in my opinion, it is so-so. My Galician friend and I did much better pimientos padrón at her house and I had a much more amazing chipirones in some random places in La Coruña. The supposedly popular pulpo gallego is also disappointing. The octopus were too chewy...none of the food was memorable. I expected much more from a place that is a brainchild of Michelin-starred chef
4
Great small plates of food, really tasty tapas style food. A good selection of items for vegetarians too, and really tasty deserts. One star lost because of the uncomfortable seating style - sharing tables with others on uncomfortable, Asian sized chairs is not the nicest way to spend an evening catching up with friends
4
Excellent paella and patatas bravas. Need to improve on the octopus. Food came out quick ... Which is excellent.
4
Good wine, cocktails and tapas. Great service. Would go again. Tried the sea bass, octopus, lamb, ham, bread /tomatoes
4
it was my birthday and I was with my husband and we had a great time there. Service was prompt and full of smiles
5
Love this restaurant great atmosphere delicious food and the service is particularly good we will be back
4
Cocktails are extremelty good, super impressed. Loved the foie gras and octopus as well. Ambience was definitely cosy and comfy for dates/chill out~
5
Good quality food with excellent friendly service. Definitely more prices compared to Barcelona but hey we are in Singapore. Rent is high. Good staff is expensive.
3
The staff members were very nice to help us hold the table while we were rushing there. However, we were told that there was going to be a 2 hours cap as there were 2 seatings, and this made the dinner very rushed. Service staff was very enthusiastic, but may be slightly imposing when we were still looking through the menu or when we were half done with the food.However, the food was disappointing. I've read tons of reviews and had high expectations, but the experience did not live up to the expectation. The Magnum Cheesecake was nothing but a pseudo-Magnum ice cream which was not even as nice (and it costs $12) and the Open Tortilla was unspectacular and extremely costly
4
First thing I noticed was how great the atmosphere was when we walked in. It's a great place for a social dinner. It's not too loud you can hear yourselves speak. The food is tapas style each dish we tried was excellent the desert is also very goodThe staff are very good at Recomended what to order and explaining each dish as it comes out. Great service. Note they also offer ballet parking
5
Second time here, the service is prompt and friendly as compared previous occasion. A BIG thumbs up IMHO as hard to have such efficient team. Kudos to the mgt to give the staff good guidance.Food is good, not the best tapas in SG but presentation is beautiful and given thoughts to. Second time for squid ink paella and char grilled octopus. Very outstanding choices ! Give the dessert a skip... FOC does tapas and savoury better than the sweets
1
I had great expectations for this place. However the dishes were overpriced, mediocre for the claims made and frankly I am astonished by the good reviews given for the food. Seems like another one of these places that everyone thinks is good, claims is good but the reality is not this
5
The food was certainly of awesome quality and the staff was excellent in his recommendations for the food as well as the cocktails. Was also pleasantly surprised by the little birthday cake to commemorate the occasion.
5
Delicated spanish food with a kistch deco. Don't miss to taste "gazpacho". It was great!
Tip: reserve previously
5
Tried FOC with a friend. Everything was great: food, wine, cocktails, service. Will be back sooner rather than later.
3
In my opinion the food just wasn't that great! The tapas was decent, but nothing amazing. I have had much better Tapas elsewhere. The sangria was a bit too sweet and just didn't hit the spot. I would give it another try just because my husband loved it and has been many times and tells me it is amazing so i want to give it a second chance. But i'm not yet convinced
5
Favorite Spanish restaurant in Singapore and easily one of our favorite restaurant, period. I recommend you sit at the bar and watch the chefs do their magic. The chefs are friendly and will engage in a little chit chat (if they are not too busy and frazzled), not to mention learn a bit about food and cooking. Try the pintxos on Saturdays lunch. More relaxed and less busy/noisy, same menu plus a dozen or so delicious pintxos.
5
Every once in a while you need to go somewhere to remind yourself of how life should be lived. Somewhere hip, filled with beautiful people, great food and drink with great company. FOC is one of those places. Great food - especially enjoyed the squid ink paella which lacked the char I'm used to at the bottom of my paellas, but more than made up for with flavour and texture. Didn't have much to drink, but what I had was good and reasonably priced for a place like this. Can't wait to go back
5
1 of the best tapas bars I have ever been with lots to eat..drink & see. Not super polished fine dinning, but still Michelin-star-Nandu-Jubany style.Ambience is exciting with the 'gigantes y cabezudos' (i was told that's what those big heads were called). I am always very amused by them.Next comes the bespoke cocktails. Be surprised by their concoctions and have it almost your way but in style.Food is nothing short of amazing amazing amazing. If you can't decide, just let the guys know how many courses you want to start with and preferences, and they will get down to work picking up a good range of food for you. I usually start with 5 and move on to even 8 on a greedy night. The Galician style octopus a super-must-have and never-do-without. The octopus is grilled in the charcoal Josper oven. Hmmmmmmmmmmm can you taste it already?Other personal favorites are....The watermelon gazpacho that comes with smoked olive oil ice cream that's really quite an entree with a burst of flavours that wonderfully work together. Your palette will be made ready for the rest of the night with this.The black squid ink paella which isn't the most glamorous thing to eat but still duper-licious.Get the bar seats when you come here!! This is one open kitchen with a cocktail bar you won't want to miss. See the action happen right before your eyes
4
On entering FOC (which means fire in Catalan), you find yourself in a long, shotgun-style interior designed to be very trendy and hip, with lots of interesting surfaces (metal, wood, brick, pipes, beams, etc.) and artistic objects everywhere, and a giant chalkboard overhead with the day's menu. A long bar stretches back on the right side of the restaurant. Tables are lined up along the left side, and there is a rear portion of the restaurant with large squares of seating. If you are seated back there, expect to be at the same table as other diners. Hanging over the tables in the rear are huge white sculptures of heads. The acoustics and piped-in music make this a somewhat challenging place for quiet conversation--it's supposed to be loud and busy. The food is excellent and comes in tapas portions so you can sample many dishes. Try the Galician octopus ($22), prawns in Ajillo sauce ($20), or the braised beef cheek sliders ($16). There are paellas ($24-30) and also larger tapas suitable for an entire meal (or sharing), such as lamb ribs with curry yogurt and eggplant puree ($22), or grilled Iberico pork ribs and smoked pumpkin puree ($30). Prices are not modest, depending on how many dishes you order. Service is mixed (depending on your waiter)
3
nice place in Hong Kong street, good cocktail.staff are friendly.and the food ok,octopus was nicely seasoned.the gambas too.arroz negro a bit dry.didnt like the bacalao with apple sauce.nothing wrong really,just nothing to rave about.just pimp up average tapas. the rum baba was great.but the mini choco burger wasn't.(didnt enjoyed the sweetness of it)overall nothing wrong.but pretty average foo
4
Yup, you heard it right.. both are the highlights of this restaurant.As stated in their namecard (fine fun food), this place is a hip, trendy and serve great food. Really enjoyed the cocktail that was made by Dario Knox, one of the best mixologist in town. If you requested, he can mix the drink specially according to your preference.As for the food, we tried few things : paella, foie gras burger, galician octopus, mushroom croquette, ham croquette, scarmbled egg, baby squid, and many more!! But what remain is the watermelon gazpacho. It was surprisingly very light and fresh. The other thing that I would recommend to try will be the mushroom croquette. I can just come to the restaurant to do take away for these babies!Definitely in my list for Singapore !
5
Everything perfect: food, nice staff that made good recommendations and make us feel like home. A must: east hamburger as dessert... after you do it then you understand the recommendation.
5
Attentive stuff, delicious food!!! Bar top dining is a better experience than expected :) Get the beef steak and octopus!!!
5
Very good experience. Food was creative and nicely presented. I would return and also recommend it to friends
4
The food at FOC is the standout. Dishes are good/simple/classic Spanish food, well executed and sometimes with a twist. The Galician octopus is sensational!Service was a bit of a let-down though. There seem to be a lot of staff there, and to their credit were trying to be attentive, but just seem a little inexperienced and disorganised.This place is busy and does two seatings per night, and at times we did feel like were were getting rushed though so they could get ready for the next group. I would recommend gong for the late seating if you can, but then again last order is quite early..
3
Surprisingly poor service for such a high priced restaurant. The food was good, with lots of interesting choices. But when dropping $100 a head for dinner, I expect the waiter to get the orders right. He refused to write down the orders, and then continuously forgot to bring items or mixed them up. Buy a pencil. Use it
4
Came to FOC on a Monday night and the place was full of patrons. Very extensive cocktail menu- tried Santa's coffee and Smell like gin spirit, both were excellent. Food wise, we ordered:1.watermelon gazpacho- nice refreshing soup which wasnt overly sweet and cleansing to the palate. 2.ham croquettes- soft in the middle, crunchy on the outside and good flavour.3.cod fish fritters- not bad, but I wouldnt say these were the best version i ever had.4.octopus galician- tender octopus done just right. 5.eggs with potato and chorizo- good garlic flavour with the crispy potatoes. Could have done with a bit more chorizo but still good.6.foie gras terrine- i probably would give this a miss on my next visit. Not bad but as foie gras and terrines go, possibly a bit too rich if having more than 2 pieces.7.roast suckling pig- possibly the best dish of the night. I'm a big fan of pork and as roasts go, possibly one of the better ones i have had in a long time. Good for at least 3 people. On their specials menu so may not be available at all times. If i had to find a fault, possibly the waiters could be better trained to explain some of the dishes. They also seemed a bit "too eager" and providing some space for diners would be nice. Overall, very good restaurant and my new favourite spot for spanish food. Damage for food plus 4 cocktails and one mocktail, 3 people..$100 per head.
5
I use to write in English, but in this case, I need to explain myself a little bit in Catalan...“Va Parir!!!!”People of Singapore, you can taste one of the best world cussine in your citySmall place, friendly, good quality, best service, cool, price according with.Nando, your team in Singapore is doing a good jobFor sure I’ll visit this place againAsk for the suggestions, Carme will inform you propertyDon’t miss the Chocolate hamburger desert………………

An evening out with fellow participants at an INSEAD programme in Singapore. We sat at a table under a huge white plaster casting of a head....fun. Selection excellent, food great. The mixed selection of starters was tastefully prepared. We enjoyed 3 styles of paella - including one with squid ink - very tasty. A good evening out
3
I went to FOC after being recommended by a friend and was expecting some great Spanish tapas with a slightly modern twist. We ordered some classics : tomato bread (nice but nothing special), ham croquetas which were very yummy(the only thing I really enjoyed), cauliflower and pine nuts (so so), pulpo a la gallega - nicely cooked but doused in too much paprika to the point where I tasted powder on my pulpo (not happy :-( )... The Iberico pork ribs were very disappointing. They tasted "unfinished" - not a great taste and definitely not soft enough (I do mine better at home). The crema catalana was nothing like a cream catalana - more like a vanilla custard foam with a side biscotti that almost broke my teeth..All in all, perfectly passable meal but then again, this is quite an expensive restaurant so I expect more... So, yes, rather disappointing :-
5
We had a very good experience. Great tapas, a good "fishermen paella" (with noodles instead of rice, as fishermen cannot afford the time to cook the rice as we were explained) that is rather uncommon to find, and an excellent wine recommended by our host. The ambiance is youthful. A bit noisy for my taste-but I know my taste is not mainstream, and the noise was not a serious obstacle for conversation. The valet parking is very useful, as the area is hopelessly busy. We were told that you can even have a driver to bring you back home if you overdid it with the wine!
5
Service is brilliant as well as food and drink . It is very chick and friendly. I would recommended to friends
4
Apple tart and the paella was so good. thought the foie gras wasn't as good as expected tho. but still worth the go!
5
Juanjo was heading the kitchen and he was awesome. Fresh ingredients , very fine and perfectly executed tapas and main course.
5
The food was excellent and the atmosphere was great. Love the music and service was very good. Only thing I would comment is that sharing the table with 3 other parties with every party ordering their own set of food, meant the table was very clustered and it was quite uncomfortable.
5
Came here on a weekday evening, and it was already packed by 6:30pm. The restaurant has a very bubbly clientÃ¨le and staff were all very friendly and professional. They attend to all your needs. We sat by the bar as we did not make reservation. But it was good as we could see the bartender at work and he was very helpful and also hospitable to make sure we were well. DrinksBesides cocktails and beer, there is also an extensive wide range of wine list from Spain region. FoodBeside the tapas, there were also main dishes for the customer to chose. The tapas itself is already very filling and to speak the truth: the taste was really good especially the squid and the scallops. The croquet are also very tasty. They may look small but just about 5 tapas is already very filling already. PriceGet this, I thought It will be around $100 per pax minimum for a decent night. With such good ambience, 2 rounds of drinks and 5 tapas. We paid about $150 Singapore Dollars only. Really very worth it. The staff were also very friendly, despite us last minute having to cancel a steak ( Too Full), they were still very obliged.Valet parking is availabl
5
Had a fantastic meal here with friends over the weekend. All the tapas was excellent and the 1kg beef to share was superb! Not cheap, but you pay for quality and this is worthwhile. Friendly and helpful staff and a very cool athmosphere. A great place to go with friends
5
The food was great! Must try: Grilled octopus, scallop with caviar, paella (I tried 2, chicken and squid ink, both are good)The parking at Hong Kong street is terrible that's why they had valet parking. Or u can park at the Central. The restaurant is quite dark. It's good if they provide little torch to read the menu or best if they can light up the restaurant more. Sangria! A common Spanish drink. We had sangria, but a little disappointed because it was not to the standard that I expect compared to the other Sangria that I tried at other places. More fruits and variation would be good! It's a Spanish restaurant after all!The staff. She made good introduction and recommendation to the food. She's very friendly, makes small talks.. But abit over chatty because she interrupted my friends conversations a few times. Remember to book the restaurant in advanced! My friends and I visited on a Thursday and it is full house. There were another round of seatings after us.
5
One of the best table in Singapore. Need to book. Prefer to have diner at the counter so you'll see your food cooked right in front of your eyes. Good wines and overall good athmosphere with very good quality of service. One of the finest tapas I ever had. Strongly recommended
5
Having been to many Southern US Bourbon Bars, the likes of Husk in Charleston etc. this was a pleasant surprise. Bartender poured your choice of bourbon and proceeded to fill a tiny smoker with your choice of wood and ignited. The smoke was then placed in the most interesting glass with a spout filled and then poured into the cocktail. (at least thats how I remember). The combination led to the best tasting glass of bourbon ever. I will definitely recommend to friends and visitors to Singapore. Did not stay around for the food, but wish we did. Bravo to our bartender.
5
In my trip in Singapore, Tired of nodles and rice, I found a Spanish restaurant, that was amazing, I feel like a trip in spain in a summer holidays, the food was totally spanish taste, the atmosphere in the restaurant is seems all of them are spanish and they are very friendly and the prices was so good according to the qty, and the qlty. totally recomend this place, if I back to Singapore, I will come back again
5
Foc has always been my top choice of restaurants to go when I have friends in town! Impeccable service and food as well a great looking crowd immersing the hipster atmosphere!
5
FOC...Excellent authentic Spanish food. Unique deco that adds up to the good point of this place. Great service from FOC team. Great for after work drink and some tapas. Must try is their unique Mini Burger ...for the dessert though
5
Authentic yet modern Spanish and Catalan cuisine; very friendly service. This restaurant really stands out for its quality ingredients and superb cuisine
5
Great food, nice cocktails, service where over the moon and back. We sat in the bar. Speedy service and Carmen took care of us. Don't miss the all chocolate dessert. If your in Singapore. Stop by. Ps. Down the road is a really nice cocktailbar. 28 Hong Kong street
2
Went on a Friday night, the place was super busy, you share a table or seat at the counter, making it a relax and cool place. Different waiters looked after us, a bit confusing and our orders got mixed up. Mentioned twice that we did not order a particular plate and they insist we did. I told them to leave it on the table. Five minutes later, came back and apologise for the mistake, the plate was for another table ... Overall, noisy, trendy, average tapas with a few gem like the tortillas. And expensive, the Spanish white Chardonnay at almost 100S$ a bottle is not worth 10â‚¬ in Spain. Disappointing, it looks better that it taste
1
Went to FOC with a long time friend to catch up. We booked based on previous pleasant experience. Turned out they had a corporate party in the back ongoing that was becoming a shouting and screaming party with drunk guys, each shouting louder than the other.Despite regular request to staff to do something about this, it was not changing, having us stop the diner.A pity and a disgrace to management. Especially as this is not a cheap place and I had a bill of almost 400SGD for the 3 of us. After insisting they removed a small amount.Make sure you check if there are any ongoing corporate events and if so, do not allow yourself to be placed in the back.They managed to ruin my evening.Arnau
3
Heard some good reviews from friends but when we went there, was really shocked how unknowledgable were the waiters. I asked whats the difference about their cheese platters, none of them knew. One waiter finally had to ask one of the cooks. Food was okay for the price.
5
The food here is the main attraction, it is outstanding, however we were very happy to experience a buzzy, atmospheric dining vibe. Considering Singapore seems to be the land of great food but souless dining, FOC is a 'must visit' on your restaurant list. I have no doubt you will return
1
Been here many times before. Usually it's good to great. This lunch was mediocre at best. Unfortunately this time the cook also took it upon himself to make his sauce in his little blender at the bar, open kitchen, and double dip (triple actually) the spatula from the bowl to his mouth. Really don't need his virus - or worse - for lunch. Not. Coming. Back.
3
Dinner was lovely. Brendan was our fab waiter and he did an amazing job finding out information on dishes and recommending some wine to us. The only issue I had, was that the floor boards were breaking/ had holes in it and my chair kept falling into them. My friend and I were wearing heels and our heels kept going through the floorboards as well! Mentioned this to our waiter Brendan.. Hopefully it will be fixed in time for the next guest!

Excellent food as always,service and ambience fantastic.Always a great dining experience,recommend sitting at the counter,that way you get to see the full repotoire of dishes from the kitchen not just the ones you order.
5
Made a same day reservation, arrived early but still got seated promptly. Service was fast and the food were amazing!
4
Great tapas, nice decor and good atmosphere. Service was a little green - several different waiters trying to clear dishes before we were finished but would definitely return.
5
Excellent meal, great and knowledgeable service including checking ingredients for nuts to avoid an allergic reaction. Music is excellent as well.
4
First time visit. Great food and excellent service. Knowledgable staff. Ambience very nice. Would definitely recommend and do a repeat visit
5
Went there for dinner on Christmas Day. The service and food was good! My fifth visit there and loving it!
4
Place us tastefully decorated with rustic feel. Food is decent with the price tag. Service staff are plenty and give customers deserving attention.
5
Having lived in Spain and eaten some of the best Spanish food in the world I can confidently say FOC is on of the best and most inventive in the world let alone Singapore. Attentive, intelligent and motivated staff just add to the appeal of this excellent restaurant. Please go there.

Ordered a few tapas, along with a serving of squid ink paella, it was absolutely delightful. Restaurant was tastefully decorated, and the dining crowd rallied the spirit of chill and spontaneity. Highly recommended for any occasions, yes! even if you've heart is just broken. The restaurant has a good selection of wine, and Tapas are great with wine. Be sure to make a reservation, not a huge venue

Went for a quick last minute dinner. Very chic looking place with a nice atmosphere . The Octopus was so good, tender with the smoky sweet paprika . Simple, yet done well. Also had the simple tomato and toast which reminded me of the ones I had in Madrid for breakfast . As well having Jamon Iberico is always an added plus! Wasn't too sure about the desserts tho. But minor detail in comparison. Wines by the glass are extremely well done and priced .
5
The food at FOC was excellent. Oysters were very fresh and the highlight of our meal was the eel and roasted pork belly which just melted in our mouths.
5
FOC is a great restaurant. Great food, the steak is awesome and service is consistently good. Will go back again and again.
5
Good food by only the best chefs flown from Barcelona. Hats off for Jordi, former Food Dada chef.
Friendliest staff who gives you all the attention you need and of course food recommendation..
Love the comfortable seats and dining experience. Cool industrial like settings...
5
decent food, friendly and efficient staff and fab cocktails! We didn't particularly care for one dish and staff took back with zero questions asked and suggested another item on the menu, which we loved!!!
5
I love the food here. Every dish that was served was stellar, not one was ok-ish. What we did was sit by the bar, just get the chef to bring you whatever he wishes - much like a japanese omakase. When you've had enough just tell him to stop. Make sure you save some space for dessert, because the chocolate burger is out of this world.The wines are great as well. Worked out to about USD100 per head including drink
5
The service, even before we entered the restaurant, was great (called to check if I was going to be there, was late due to traffic jam), everything we ordered was awesome, esp the squid ink paella, and the pintxos (we were there for brunch)!! My second visit, first was last year for dinner, and I still strongly recommend this place!
5
A quiet lunch with a friend was spend here with pleasure. Service was on point which is a lovely treat in a sea of not so very good. The tapas are all well done, and dishes are spaced out wonderfully so we don't get everything all at once. And ofcourse the Bloody Jordi is just a delightfully punchy savory cocktail as usual.  
4
Tapas of a high standard, of Catalan origin, and like all good restaurants, an atmosphere to go with it. Busy on a Monday night, which is a good sign, the jambon (ham) was the winner. Expensive ($30 for six delicate shaves), but awesome flavour. The cheese platter was a bit blah, and the waiter couldn't tell me which one was which. Standout was the Manchego. All in all, pretty good. About $90 per head, not including wine
4
Had a fantastic girls's night out with my two besties. The whole experience was great. The service was very attentive and the food was good though not great. We ordered the - ham croquettes-piquillon peppers-sautÃ©ed cauliflower -prawns -squid ink paella -lamb ribs -mixed cheese platter Only the lamb ribs and croquettes made a lasting impression though the rest were good but not fantastic. The wine selection was good and we enjoyed two bottles of their whites. However, very sadly the deserts were really disappointing. Again, we ordered cream catalana, chocolate galaxy and flaming rum baba which were strictly strictly ok and the three of us love our sweets so it was quite a bummer. Overall, we had a great time. Will def be back and kinda liked the communal table concept. Hopefully the desserts improve!!
4
Always busy, they must be doing something right but the crowds mean you sometimes have to share a communal table. The food is generally well done, although not cheap and the place is quite self-consciously cool. All of their croquettes were excellent and their cod fritters with apple sauce were really fantastic. Good selection of wines with quite a few by the glass and a decent number of bottles below the S$100 mark
4
Except the sitting, which was a bar sitting the overall experience was good. The food was great and the choice was ample but not confusing...
5
Food never fails in here. Services as well. And try to squeeze some space for the dessert also as its just too darn delish and you dont wanna miss it
5
Every dish was excellent; service was prompt and attentive. Restaurant was not too formal - chill place to hangout and have a great meal
4
I had not been to FOC in a while, and I am so glad I went back. The squid ink paella is a can't-miss (although it does turn your teeth / mouth black!)... we also loved the grilled octopus and the mushroom croquettes. Our server was friendly and helpful... Only downside was their seating timings which were quite strictly enforced, as we had to leave the table by 9pm (7-9pm seating). However, this was well communicated ahead of time, so was not a big deal
4
Great place to have tapas after a tiring day at work. Authentic Catalan cuisine. Squid ink paella is tasty. Downside is very small portion for a Spanish restaurant. the Good selection of wine. Can be a bit crowded and noisy with strangers on the same table. Overall, worth visiting
2
I chose the restaurant for a special occassion having eaten there before at lunchtime and enjoyed the food. However, when I booked a table for 6.30 and arrived around 6.50 they had given up my table. We were then offered another table but told we could only use it for 1hr. While I'm sure this is a popular restaurant I think they have forgotten the spirit of spanish dining. I did not appreciate being rushed, since we spent over $250 between the 2 of us, we were made to feel like cattle and the attitude was as though we should have been grateful even to get a table. We had to finish our drinks on the pavement outside. Needless to say I will not be returning
5
One of those restaurant that got it all: great service, good vibes, cool design and most importantly amazing food. We ordered family-style in a group of 4 and among the 10 dishes we must have tried we loved every single one of them. Well, not a restaurant you'd go to on a regular basis as its bit on the pricey side but its the first place I wanna take all my visitors too. Well done guys
5
This is probably my fifth or sixth visit since it's opening. The food is consistently good and service as prompt as ever. My favourite dishes are the Squid Ink Paella, full of seafood flavour, as well as the Iberico Pork Ribs, Grilled Octopus and Mushroom Croquettes. The convivial atmosphere attracts large dinner parties so if you thinking of an intimate tete a tete with a date, go next door afterwards.
5
Great atmosphere, friendly and knowledgeable staff and amazing food and cocktails. We have been to many Spanish restaurants in Singapore and in Spanish and this one still stands out.Must try:Catalan CreamGallic OctopusNero PaellaIberico pork ribsHam croquettesWe love this place so much that we dine here almost every week
3
Wrong choice for a family visit. Not the restaurant's fault - we just picked an unsuitable place. Too noisy to hear ourselves speak. Tiny portions (the paella was literally a single 1 grain thick layer of rice spread out in the pan...). Oily food. The cocktails were a glass full of crushed ice with a few drops of drink on the side. Service was good though. Fast. Friendly. Efficient. Super ex. You could eat at a 5-star buffet for this price.
4
Very tasty mix of tapas. More interesting than the usual Spanish fare. Portions were just about right for a group of 4. Lovely hostess. Wines are expensive for a tapas restaurant. Closer to a fine dining restaurant price. Will go back for a special evening.
5
Food was amazing, and service was superb - staff were all very attentive and friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Wish more restaurants in Singapore were like this!
5
Never disappoints. Worth every cent. Fresh ingredients, attentive servers, good wine list , changing menu. Nice atmosphere. Not too large. I love this place
5
Love the ambiance, the food is tasty but a little too salty. The service staffs were excellent! I made a tiramisu cake for my friend bday and they even help me to make it even more beautiful....
4
Nice ambience tucked away in a small street. Walking distance from Clarke Quay MRT. There are options available for vegetarians.
5
The cocktail list was never ending and I tried a couple they were both excellent! The Tapas was very nice as well, bcoz we had a few vegetarians in the group we stuck to mostly vegetarian and still I loved it, the cheese platter was excellent. Overall a good lace to go again. But it's not cheap
5
Food and service was fantastic as always, considering how busy the restaurant always is. Surprised my dad with his favorite type of food for his birthday and was surprised myself when FOC brought out a birthday cake for my dad at the end of the meal. Great job
5
We visited on a busy Saturday night and the food, service and atmosphere were still very good. I would recommend this restaurant for an evening with friends or a casual evening meal with your partner. Great value, we paid 138 sgd for 6/7 dishes and 2 G&T's. There is a great hidden bar a few doors away too worth a try after the meal
4
The cocktails blow my mind as always, no matter it's on the menu or bespoke on the spot. I ordered tapas to take away - my bad but I just have a craving for it while I want to lie in my sofa. It took a while for this newly added item to deliver to me so the staff were quite apologetic and gave me a shot for free, which got me to complain nothing. Overall it's still one of my favorite bars in Singapore.
3
Food was decent, and service was... well some staff tried...but not quite... Admittedly mistake was probably mine in booking this for a romantic event. Totally the wrong place. They had no proper seating and sat us at a squished bar. Despite the maitre'd saying she would re-seat us at a table, she never did even when one came up. Staff were trying, but I don't understand why they would insist on putting another couple right next to us when there were other bar seats empty AND we had repeatedly indicated we are trying to have some vague sense of privacy at the bar. So all in all... they get top marks for "smiling" and asking "how is everything", but zero for common sense and genuinely trying?
4
Lovely food and the crew is attentive. Gave suggestions and were always ready to please. Celebrated a friend's birthday and a wonderful gesture to have a complimentary piece of brownie with a candle.
5
Gastronomic experience. Food and service were prompt. Decoration fitted fitted the whole theme. Had a wonderful night spent with the gfs!
4
The place was dimly lit, the waiters were very polite and nice. The food was above expectation, however, the reservation runs out after 2 hours. Hope we was able to have more time to chat with friends that rarely meet.
5
Very nice atmosphere, good for friends gathering, date night. Fast service, which is rare in Singapore
5
Great service, cocktails and awesome food. Perfect for a get-together, date or for entertaining guests.
5
Fantastic food served in F.O.C !!! Love the gazpacho, ham, croquettes, squid ink paella and dessert flaming rum baba....would love to be back again and try the cocktail too !
5
Thoroughly recommend dinner at FOC. We went on a Friday evening for dinner & had a great experience. Sat up at the kitchen area so could see the chef's preparing all the food. The service was friendly & they were very attentive, assisting with wine recommendations & advising on the dishes. I was also very impressed when they brought out a birthday cake for my boyfriend when i hadn't prompted for this but simply mentioned this with the booking. I will definitely be going back for dinner again

I took my colleagues for a celebratory lunch at FOC since I’ve heard so much about the place and we all love Spanish food (I lived in Spain for 3 years)… it was the first time for all of us… Venue is really cool, great décor and ambiance… it was lunch and the place was 50% full… We ordered multiple items (2 of the specials of the day -avocado gazpacho and cauliflowers with romesco sauce-, octopus, cod fritters, squid ink paella, fideua, open tortilla, piquillo peppers, fish and beef and I must say that while the presentation of each one of the dishes was beautiful, I was unpleasantly surprised by the size of the dishes: they were all tiny! Moreover, the quality and flavours of the dishes were not consistent… The avocado gazpacho was ok, but nothing exceptional, the cauliflower was tasteless and a really really small portion… the piquillo peppers needed more salt, the open tortilla was delicious but it was exactly 4 tiny bites in total (think shrunken mini crepe)… the beef was exceptionally good as was the fish… What drove us a bit mad is that service was all over the place.. trying to be polite and efficient but they forgot about our dishes… we ordered, dishes started to arrive, then nothing for 20 minutes, then one main dish arrived, then nothing, then after 10 minutes another main arrived and not until another 30 minutes the other 2 mains came… and some of the tapas never arrived or arrived once we had finished the mains, which is totally unacceptable… basically we waited more than 50 minutes between tapas and mains, which was really annoying…I complained and the chef sent complimentary dessert (crème catalan) which was really good and we ordered as well the chocolate galaxy, which was really good as well… Overall a very disappointing experience… some dishes were really amazing, other fell flat and the service was so bad.. but to me the worst part is paying over 100 sgd per person and leaving a restaurant feeling hungry
5
At FOC, the staff took pride and effort to explain to the diners how best to enjoy each dish when it is served. The staff are efficient and polite. I was there with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and the staff saw that I was opening a gift so she served us a birthday cake after our desserts as she thought it was my birthday. She was really thoughtful and we enjoyed the experience we had at FOC. The food was excellent, and the atmosphere was relaxing
5
We had been here once before and because we liked it so much, we just had to go again... which we did. If you really like good Spanish tapas in a trendy environment, then look no further because this is the place to be. Be it patatas bravas, prawns in garlic oil, paella, toast with tomato, seabass,... it is al so delicious. Prices are not the cheapest, but with such high quality products that only seems normal. A great place you won't regret
5
Very reasonably priced fantastic food, great service, inventive cocktails and great atmosphere. Good casual dining.
4
Not your normal tapas or pinxos like you see in Spain, but it is michelin level taste and the open kitchen operates like a well-oiled machine!
5
Do try the grilled octopus and squid ink paella. It's exceptional! Interesting selection of cocktails.
5
Attentive service with great awareness of their offerings that delighted the senses and the only downside was the dual seating that meant that we had to leave too soon after we started - 2.5 hours later ;-)
4
Was there 2 days ago and had to return again. Today I was seated at the open kitchen counter and looking at the yummy food prepped before they were served; had us ordering more that what we initially intended.
4
Food and service was good. Will definitely return. Booking was easy and staff are responsive. We went there with friends who were visiting singapore and the staff made it a pleasant and memorable experience *thumbs up* :)
4
I've been putting off my visit to FOC for ages, but better late than never, for the experience here is truly unique.Service: Shout out to the service team who were all very warm and attentive without being intrusive. The hostess Jacqueline (the spelling might be otherwise) and the crew were awesome and helped to coordinate a birthday surprise for my friend, even throwing in a complimentary birthday cake while at that. Decor: I was impressed at how tastefully the different elements were strewn together. Scandivanian-style furniture, pepper shaker lights, hanging fixtures made of laboratory apparatus, larger-than-life bobbleheads, and a whole lot of quirky touches that made dining extra fun at FOC.Food: Plates like the Grilled Octopus ($22), Scrambled Egg & Potatoes with Chorizo ($10), Lamb Ribs with Curry Yoghurt and Eggplant Puree ($22) were pretty tasty but the stand-outs for me were the Beef Cheek Sliders ($16) - fork-tender meat sandwiched between crisp buns topped with piquant kimuchi mayo, and the MUST-ORDER Squid Ink Paella ($24) - we couldn't get enough of the deeply flavourful grains that were cooked to a perfect consistency. For dessert, we had the FOC Mini Chocolate Burger ($12) - the absolutely adorable cheeseburger-lookalike tasted delightful as well.Drinks: Cocktails were creative and reasonably-priced. We had the gin-based Madame Butterfly ($13) and cachaca-based Blacked Out in Bangkok ($13.50). I really enjoyed the latter, which sported Asian-influences such as lemongrass-ginger, jasmine tea, kaffir lime, chili-padi, etc. Tasty & refreshing!Conclusion: FOC checks all the boxes for good food, drinks, and service. Definitely recommend this place for great tapas and a fun night out with a date or group
5
I can just say that everything is amazing in this place!!! We live nearby and always come across FOC with it's vibrant and cozy place. One night we walked in for dinner. We were lucky to get 2 seats by the bar as apparently, this place has to be booked way in advance.Food is amazing, no complaints on all tapas we have ordered. The paella is again AMAZING. Being seated on the bar counter, the dinner was quite interactive with staffs casually engaging you in conversations. They even perform some silly fun dances while mixing your drinks. My overall experience was a fun and fulfilling evening. I will definitely come back
4
Half the restaurant was extremely dark, wheres the high counter tables at the back half of the restaurant was brightly lit.Service was very fast and we were done with all our food orders in an hour.Excellent tapas and all recommended items were extremely well prepared and tasty.Special mention to the Black Mediterranean Squid ink paell
5
Ambiance is good - funky arts and good music Food is amazing - scallops are tender, caviar on top of those is tasty and the Japanese soy sauce soup is full of flavors. Fried squid is not oily and the dip is a plus. The green peppers explode in my mouth with flavor and texture. The red peppers are sweet more like tomatoes and they pair well with the squid ink paella. Cocktails are creative art pieces! Cinnamon power coated glass with refreshing ingredients made the whole night fun and exciting. Bar-tenders and waiters are all professional, attentive, fun to talk to and all super hot with Spanish beard! 
5
Place is great!
Food is great! Fresh and flavourful. Delicious.
Great service. Staff are friendly. They make sure your table is clean.
It's just simple great.
4
Super food and ambience. The Tapas and food were excellent. Busy place and reservations are advisable. Located in a quiet street.
4
FOC a testament to the complexity of food in Singapore. FOC delivers taste on decor and food. Recommend the burgers especially the dessert one,
5
Small place, but good tapas with an interesting twist for some. Dishes we enjoyed most included the Foie Gras Burgers, some beef steak, these mushroom croquettes, and even dessert was good and interesting with a nice crema catalana.
5
We have been to FOC at least 5 times in the last 3-4 months and it's never disappointing. We always get to try a new dish or two as the menu changes. I love the squid ink paella and the serving size is perfect for 2 as tapas. The coca is tasty as was the steak we had 2 nights ago. As for the prawns, they have 2 types - one from Spain and one local. I will say for us the local prawns beat those from Spain in taste and texture and what even better is the price is lower and you get more prawns :)The rum baba is fabulous. Boozy for sure but a good wrap up for a nice meal
5
Booking via Chope was seamless and the meal was amazing - we chose to test a few of the smaller dishes and were not disappointed. Our Spanish waitress recommended an amazing Spanish white wine which went beautifully with the meal. Great ambience, service and atmosphere - sitting at the counter watching the kitchen staff create the amazing food
3
good and reasonable priced. would have been perfect if the food is not served together, severing the tapas and main at the same time, sending a wrong signal that the staff is rushing you to finish your foodhearts for:very fresh mushroom and crispy croquettes - yum!tender, juicy perfectly braised beef cheek sliders - so good!flavorful squid ink paella, good consistency, not too soggy or too dry - yum o!
5
FOC is the best casual and lively Spanish Restaurant in Singapore. The counter seat is nice to pick some of the tapas and you can see the chef cooking. The restaurant has lots of energy at night and it can be loud with large group enjoying a good time. The food is excellent and the staffs are fun and trendy. If you want to try something other than Asian Food in Singapore, this is the place to go
2
We had high expectations going to FOC. After all, the chef has earned a Michelin star, so you can expect good things. Unfortunately, our expectations were not met. The tapas were the size of pinxtos. Finger food.... Very expensive finger food! Plus, one of the tapas arrived after the paella, when we had asked for tapas first. The quality of the tapas was good, but we've had better in bars in Sevilla and Valencia. The paella with squid rice was good, with clams and shrimp, but the other was bland and under seasoned. Deserts again okay, but nothing to write home about. The wine we ordered was not available from the year on the list. That didn't change the price though! In all, we had a lovely dinner because of the company, but not because of the restaurant
1
This place has changed. I was a regular but last night. Desperate. Booked for 7. Needed 2 extra. Told only choice was a table that included minimum charge of 88++ per person. Bank holiday weekend. Place empty. Girlfriends gave in. Tables next door occupied by 3 pax and 5, Food thrown at us to get us out Wine waiter CLUELESS on glasses and serving white wine in red wine glasses. Very Sad. Feel ripped off. 
5
Great food - very fresh!
Different take on tapas!
Chefs are very friendly!
Only issue was the Door Hostess - very rude!
Apart from that a great experience.
5
Stylish decor and food presentation. Mini burgers, both tapas and desert version are incredible. Squid and baby octopus are excellent and the house rioja is a good accompaniment.
4
Food was nice. Similar to tapas dishes in Spain: pulpo, pimentos de padron, tortilla etc . Recommend it.
4
It's in an interesting location. We booked via Chope and they were very prompt in calling back and confirming our reservation. The service was excellent and the staff obviously enjoy working there. They interacted well with everyone. The food was a mixed bag. We only had the starters and tapas. Followed by dessert. We liked the watermelon gazpacho with olive oil ice cream. The croquettes were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. However the open tortilla with peppers and truffle was way too salty. The saltiness drowned out any of the subtle flavors. (An expensive experience at $26!). For dessert, I enjoyed the crema catalana. It was light with a good cover of caramelized sugar. A good end.Most of the dishes were nice.
4
The ambiance of the place is very nice: open kitchen where guests can sit on the counter, spacious enough that they still have tables around. The style is in truth quite similar to Lolla and Esquina. Service is definitely better though. The staff was friendly, professional, and proactive. They offered to cut up the chicken and help us share without us asking, unusual for this type of restaurant. Food on the other hand was not that remarkable. They used good ingredients and I liked the ham, especially with the tomato toast. But other than that, nothing to shot about. One friend rated it OK, another said "above average". Still, a good nice place to hang out with friends, at reasonable price
4
the Galician octopus and the peppers were an amazing start to the meal. the pork jaw with cauliflower purÃ©e would have been awesome as a main course with the crispy crackling and the meat that melted in your mouth. the scallops were alright, a little overdoned and wasn't hot. nothing too fancy. the beef cheek sliders needed a little more bite to its patty; it seemed a little too mushy for our liking. the cocktails were amazing and very well. catered to the individual's palate. loved the Churchill old fashionprice range was that of a usual tapas bar. slightly pricey but definitely worth a visit for its ambience and occasional hits and misses with the food. the desserts like the creme catalan and French toast could do with some tweaks.
5
Food is really tasty and the ambiance is pretty cool. Thumbs up for the designers (except for the boxes of water, coke, etc under the seats). However the best thing from this place is their staff: super friendly, professional and always there when you need them. Cocktails were probably the best ones we had in singapore.
5
I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone willing to pay a little bit of $$. The food and drinks were delicious, and the service was exceptional (a rarity for the city-state). My girlfriend and I sat at the bar, and we had a great view of all the food preparation. We also got a chance to chat with the chef as he was putting the finishing touches on all the dishes before sending them out to be served. He recommended a number of things to us - octopus, foie gras sliders, beef sliders, pork tacos, seafood paella, and egg scramble. All of the dishes were fantastic. The portions are tapas-sized, so you will have to order a number of dishes, but that just means you get to try more good food.In addition, the service was great. The various waiters and waitresses who helped us were all friendly, polite, and even knowledgeable about the food (another rarity in the city-state).Book well in advance as this place is always packed
5
Not a Spanish food fan but absolutely charmed by FOC. Casual & hip were the impressions when i walked in, felt instant relax & unwind, must be the ambience and the greetings from freindly staff. Fell in love with most of the dishes, the must try are Octopus Gallega that grilled to its perfection with light crisp on its outer but the octopus remains moist and tendeness ...Confit Pork stole our hearts, as you bite, the meat juice oozed out to entice your tatse buds with the luscious flavours shot to your brain, & the meat deliciuously succulent and tender to conquor your mind; same for Cod Puff - Don't miss it. The Black Rice is an eye catcher, when I had my 1st mouth spoon, the aromatic flavours and its texture made me can't stop wanting to have more, won over our hearts like a champ
5
This Spanish Tapas restaurant down a dark seedy street is a FIND. Resident friend Stephen and his partner hunted it out and we were the lucky ones to enjoy it also.Staff sassy and SPANISH, ambience a ripper, COCKTAILS sublime and then the food. Well it is best to say it truly delivers by a 2 Michelin Star chef(young).Many variations and modern ones on the tapas theme and we will mark this as a MUST do in 5 weeks when we return.Took 3 weeks to get a booking !!!!!!!
5
Best Spanish food in Singapore .... The place is awesome !!! Perfect fit any day... The good is authentic and cooked with lots of love !!!!
5
Must-try: Galician Octopus, Mushroom Croquettes, Paellas, Pork Ribs... well, you can't go wrong with anything in their menu really!
4
Good vibe. Ambience. a buzz
Food is solid and consistent.
Service was functional. Some errors or miscommunication
All round, pretty good. Will be going back
5
First things first - this place had some of the best service I've had in Singapore. Our waitress was brilliant. Passionate, honest and attentive. The food was really tasty, desserts were delicious and after a couple of bottles of wine, a chocolate/espresso martini was a cherry on the top. Yum
4
Walked in on a Tuesday at 6am and surprised to get seats for two available (given all the hype about it). Straight away loved the decor: perfect warm lighting main room is more industrial with warm shades of green and with a long bar behind which you have patrons sitting in smaller tables. Towards the back of the room you'll find large ikea like square wooden tables seating 9 pax (we took a corner seat on one as we don't mind sharing). As the crowds started walking in, there was a real energy and pulsating buzz in the restaurant. In terms of the food, we ordered around 5 dishes. Our favourite was the Octopus Gallician Style served on a wooden platter with smoked paprika. Octopus is all about texture and this is what we thought they had it right with the perfect mix of chewy and tenderness. The Grilled Scallops with Soy Caviar likewise was also excellent with a very juicy finish in a marinate of fish sauce and soya. The gambas was ok although we prefer it with the shells off. In terms of drinks, being wine fans, we looked through the wine list. If you compare this list to retail prices of lets say, wines from Ribera Del Duero, I would say the mark up is around 250% which is not cheap. So we opted for house pours and surprisingly found the Spanish Sauvignon Blanc, Basa both refreshing and full of bouquet. For red, we also opted for a few glasses of Pago de los Capellanes Temprallino which was full bodied, but well balanced with a lovely bouquet. Both wines by the glass under SGD 14 which I thought was excellent for the quality. A young chinese male waiter (who obviously uses very shiny hair wax) served us the wines and we were happy with his generous servings!! Overall, gives Burnt Ends a run for its money. Will definitely come back
5
Sat by the bar so able to see the kitchen. The food was excellent and I highly recommend the chocolate burger for dessert., I thought it would be too sweet, but oh no, it's perfect...I can still taste it, amazing. The bartenders will make you drink, but ask you what you prefer, what kind of tastes and alcohol, they know what they are doing
5
Special attention paid to us by the staff and founding members of FOC made this evening memorable. Sure, we were chased out after our 2 hour booking time limit was up (as it was booked up by someone else).. However, they accommodated to the reservation just days before. So we understand. Atmosphere is cultured and contemporary. Portions satisfactory. Plating exquisite. And taste hit the spot on all dishes but one. Would recommend the scallops (our favourite), peppers and octopus. Smiles on everyone's faces made them a pleasure to be around. You can't say that about many places in Singapore. Definitely get the bar seats if it's just you and her! Don't be boring and isolate yourself on the tables
5
1. The service staff were attentive, prompt, well-informed and eager to learn about areas in which they were not sure of the answers.2. The ambiance, especially at the rear was special.3. The location is easy to reach by public transport.4. The food was varied and tasty, although a bit oily for my taste.5. Chef Jordi was friendly and willing to listen. Also, his English is excellent
3
It's a great place to get together with friends, food was pretty enjoyable but our only gripe was that the portions were a wee bit tiny for sharing and for the price.Service was good which kind of made up for the lack of portions but overall we had a good time there.Definitely go for the mushroom croquettes, paella and (mini mini) beef cheek sliders
2
I've not written on Tripadvisor for years but felt compelled to express my opinions of our recent visit to F.O.C and their unforgettable bad service standards. The food was fairly decent, and when judged on it's own was delicious. But bearing in mind the surge of tapas joints in Singapore in the past few years, it struggles to stand out on its own since some dishes are repetitive, along with the set-up. Of the 7-8 tapas we ordered, one item was their grilled vegetables which had an unpleasant smokey taste to it, unlike their other grilled items. To best describe it, it tasted/smelled like a bunch of cigarette buds were soaked in water. It was pungent enough for all 3 of us diners to feel put off by it and we requested to return or get another dish. The server managed our request condescendingly, suggesting that we never tried food from a josper grill before, which caused this taste (but clearly, we have dined at several places where the josper grill is a key equipment and enjoyed the flavours that were produced because of it). Subsequently, the servers came up to us to provide disclaimers for every dish that they served, forewarning us of them using the josper grill again (horrors!) or preempting us of the strong marinade. While the act sounds gracious, the tone wasn't very warm and we felt belittled and ridiculed. We will never return.

We are very happy to have a restaurant in town from Nandu Jubany chef. The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly and professional. Decoration makes you feel like if you were in Catalonia. Looking forward to come back!!

Superb food and good wine list at reasonable prices. Competent service in a cool industrial space with a decent buzz.

Great food and great atmosphere (place full on a Tuesday night) watching the chef and his team dish up the tapas from the bar. Cocktails and dessert good too. Recommend.

I was taken to FOC for lunch Thursday and immediately after lunch I booked lunch again the next Saturday. I took 8 people there and we got the private room at the very back, which was nice. The restaurant was packed and there was a great buzz happening.FOC is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Singapore in a very long time. the service is good, ambiance and music super--although If I had my way I would turn down the music just a tad. The staff are very good at recommending the popular dishes. The quality of the food is very high, we had several plates of tapas and some Paella, everyone was highly impressed. And it is not expensive. It is modest in price but what place is not in Singapore......the big difference is there is very good value for money. There are too many great dishes to list here, every one for us was a home run. And make sure you leave room for dessert, they are great! Well done FOC....I just made my third booking

restaurants that charge above a casual dining average of $80 per head like foc - need to learn how to manage turns without offending customers. we were told emphatically that we were given a 2 hour dining time. we were hurried through dessert, the waiter dropped the check abruptly without our asking and told us customers from the next seating have arrived. upon leaving, we stood outside the restaurant chatting awhile and for the next 15 minutes, no second seating occupied the table at all. i'm sorry but the variety and food offerings get old after awhile. good service and attentive staff who know the menu will keep the business aliv

The food were all in tapas size. We ordered Beef Cheeks Sliders/ Foie Gras Sliders/ Squid Ink Paella/ COCA with anchovies/ Grilled pork belly. They were all amazing! The watermelon gazpacho (with tomato puree and icecream?) was very interesting. Can skip the Grilled octopus with mashed potatoes though. MUST try the FOC chocolate burger - it's a dessert!Be sure to reserve a table early and they are pretty crowded on a Saturday
5
Amazing experience at this casual but at the same time fine restaurant inspired in spanish style tapas but open to the world cuisine. Everything taste really good sorrounded by a unique atmosphere in Singapore that makes the experience unforgetable. Service is quick and nice. We liked in the bar: more casual and close to the staff. Price is reasonable for the quality so we will be back again soon!

Had the beef sliders, pulled pork taco, baby squid and squid ink paella. The beef and paella were excellent. The baby squid was also very good but the pork was only so-so. Restaurant was pretty full at lunch time so service was a tad slow but that was perfectly understandable. Will definitely come back to try some of the other dishes

There were six of us, we made reservation and was given a nice round table in the corner. Plenty to choose from the menu and daily specials so we asked for recommendations. Friendly staff, gave us a few ideas we and picked something to share. One of us tried the cocktail and she liked it. Very tasty croquettes (a little oily but nicely fried) and Cod puffs! Love the Fish, grilled vegetables, and Black rice. Pork Ribs was nicely prepared except the rack we got was 50% fatty parts. Ribeye steak, medium, was perfectly grilled. Nice Torrija too! All the portions were fairly small. Reservations recommended as it looked quite crowded during lunch hours

I had heard a lot of good things about this place and had been wanting to try this place for long. The food was very prepared with detail in presentation and even better to taste. We tried tapas (ham and mushroom croquette, patata bravas), main course (squid paella) and ice cream burger, caramel cake for dessert. They also have an elaborate drinks menu - I tried one of the in house whiskey cocktails which was yum. Loved each course but my favorite was the caramel dessert. Also, we had to share our table with another group which kinda gave the whole dining experience a more communal feel.A great value for the $, try it out if you're in Singapore - prior reservation recommended as they tend to be booked up for dinner.
4
we liked the ambience and the food was good and portions were reasonable. price alittle steep. but overall experience was good.
5
The Iberico Ham and Grilled Iberico Pork ribs were superb. Recalling the prawns in "Ajillo" sauce, the shared dessert of Crema Catalana and mini chocolate burger make me salivate once more...
5
Had lunch with business colleagues, didn't know what to expect and was completely surprised! Tapas were wonderful, great variety, and cooked to perfection. Beautiful tastes of northern Spain in Singapore. A unique restaurant, and well worth trying.
4
Great food, really enjoyed the squid ink paella but all other food also delicious. For 3 of us and 2 bottles of wine, thought the price was fair and would recommend this restaurant for a great food and night out.
5
tasty food with flavors that blend and harmonize well. dishes well thought out and make great conversation catalysts alongside the interesting cocktail menu. go in a large group to sample more dishes as every single one will intrigue you. can't wait for next visit back!

I've been a few times and was really looking forward to taking a group of friends. With a combination of rude front of house staff, an uncomfortable corner of a shared table (even though I booked 3 weeks in advance for 4 people) and the constant reminder that we have to leave....it's just not worth your fun night out with your friends. I have to agree with the previous review, the food was very average and has indeed gone down hill. The Octopus was a hit, but everything else was just ok.One of my friends who came along, was also booked to go the following week with some other friends. She didn't like it at all and thought the food was not great and portions were too small and changed her booking to another restaurant. Such a shame as this place had potential but it has let it's standards slip. I won't be back

Had dinner with to celebrate my galfriends birthdays. Unfortunately the whole experience of a 'perfect' dinner was marred by the poor service.I missed the call when the reservations called at 12 ish pm, I called back but it went into the voicemail. I left my confirmation for the dinner then. 6ish pm, the reservations called and I missed the call again. Now when I called back, someone answered and I was told that I would be having a high table. I was not pleased as I made the reservation 1 month ago. Why should I be having a high table just because my reservation was not confirmed? I told her I left my confirmation in the voicemail. What is the use of having voicemail when you don't clear? Might as well don't subscribe to it. Then she made some adjustment and I was told I could have the table till 9pm. The interesting part was I was asked to give up the table at 8.30pm once we had finished eating. If you want to linger a bit longer, no way. The food came very very fast so fast until I had to ask the service crew to slow down the orders as there was no space to put on the table. We were not given any wet towels till we had to ask for them as we saw the table next to us had those. However, they were taken away immedidately the moment we finished our dessert. We were flabbergasted as we had wanted to use them after our meal.When we asked for an extra wooden plate (the plate that was being served throughout) from the service crew, he went to ask his supervisor for 'approval'. We were given a 'disgusted' look from the supervisor. It's just only a wooden plate which I think it can be bought from Bali at decent price. Why are they so hard up in letting us have the wooden plate? We are not going to take it home.Of course besides the poor service rendered, there is no doubt the food is better tasting than most of the Spanish restaurants I have been. Be thankful I am not from the press. However, I am a secretary supporting lots of expatriates in the office and I have spread the word that the service sucks big time

Got a last minute reservation for 9pm on the day we wanted to eat. Great ambience, interesting deco and comfy seatsServers were friendly, giving suggestions on drinks and foods. Started off with with watermelon gazpacho with smoked olive oil ice cream, the flavours blended together wellThe beef cheek sliders were fantastic with a dollop of kimchi mayo sauce on top. The gambas was so so... So were the scallops. Liked the presentation, ikura on top of the scallops which were nicely placed on a shell.Loved the squid ink paella. First time trying squid ink, and first time eating paella in Singapore. Ate it previously in Spain. Pretty decent rendition. They added some sauce for you to stir it in so it won't be too dry. Desserts, we had the chocolate galaxy. Meh, seen this before at Stellar. Doesn't taste very good either. FOC burger was something interesting, a nice dessert burger to end off the meal.Didn't really like the slow service, we tend to order quickly, so we were quite surprised when food took some time to come. The table next to us seemed to have gotten their orders lost at one point of time...Tables were a little too close to each other, if you have loud conversationalists next to you, definitely not going to be comfortable. Reservations recommended, best to come early if you want to see the place less crowded. Also to get a seat at the bar, you get to see the chefs preparing the food!A little too pricey for the portions though, if the quality improves, I wouldn't mind paying what I did

I arrived early..6.40pm for a 7pm appointment. I was impressed by the deco and the ambience. Soft lighting and interesting statues.. As I was waiting by the bar, my preferred spot at any such restaurants, I watch the crowd flow in. It was full by 7.20pm, probably because they don't hold your reservation beyond twenty mins? We were further impressed by the attention from the stuff. Then came the food.. Everything was of satisfactory but for the portions served. Rather tiny for the price they charge.. Had to reorder same dishes. The showmanship of chefs was fun to observe.A must try at least once in your lifetime sort of setup.But will I go back again... Nah.

Was introduced to this place by my colleagues, hard to get a seat due to the insane buzz. Seems to be the "in" place to go to.Paellas not really authentic, was shocked to see how they did it. Other tapas were only so-so, there are better ones out there... And the dishes overall were expensive.I did like the octopus that was smoked in their charcoal oven. And also the potatoes which they sliced to resemble onions was pretty unique, although not much taste.Place was uniquely designed, but on the noisy side. It was hard to have a decent conversation unless you book the private room at the back.I guess there isn't much for me to return back. You should go there if you like to see things a little different, and if you just have money to splurge. Otherwise, hard to explain to me the value
5
The food at FOC is definitely at a totally different level... Superb ! Indeed the essence of Catalan cuisine and the measure of excellence today in Singapore.
5
Went for dinner and the food was wonderful and with great cocktail. Has the braised beef cheek slider, squid ink paella, crisp squids and the irresistible grilled pork ribs. Service was attentive and the total bill is good for the pocket. Will go again!

Went to FOC restaurant yesterday and the restaurant's air conditioner broke down. So, the place is hot and we asked the waiters to turn on the light so we can get a better lighting to eat the food. But, she refused to turn it on.
1
What a dissapointment, heard from so many must try and so we did. pfffffff, what a dissapointment, no soul to the food, and very stingy on the fish, meat, well covered up with lots of potatoes and rice. Total mismatch !
4
Very good food. Competitive cocktail prices but that is down to the limited alcohol in them. With the number of cocktails we drank we should have been much tipsier when we left than we actually were. All in all though it was good value, good food and the place has a buzzing atmosphere
5
Go here if you're not on budget Food in here is supposed to be shared. So just order as many as you want.My fave will be the squid ink paella and the crackling porkAnd do try their cocktails.It's a place that I will go back again for Spanish food

Chosen by my guest as he was keen to return for his 3rd time, a recommendation in itself particularly with the abundance of choice in Singapore.We booked seats at the 'bar' so we could watch the preparation of the food and I would thoroughly recommend this (but only for 2), still easy to talk and we could ask the chefs questions about the flavours (we engaged in a full on conversation about the sauce that topped the padron peppers which was beautiful).As is the style we ordered a number of varying dishes, the octopus was divine, the croquettes were so good we ordered another plate, the prawns were served beautifully (although required some knife and fork action .... I am afraid I resorted to fingers!!), the sliders were ok, padron peppers delicious (the winner was the sauce over the top) and finally the ribs were worth a second helping.The atmosphere was great, we ate earlyish (7pm) but it was full and I would recommend booking.Service was superb with both the waitress and chefs keen to make suggestions, we took there advice and glad we did.I will be returning to try some of the other dishes
5
Nothing to dislike about this one. A hip and intimate dining setting with a modern and cool vibe. The menu is extensive and everything is delicious. Love the squid ink paella, croquettes, as well as the prawns in garlic and white wine. We had a number of dishes and loved every one. The service is on point with efficient and friendly staff. I recommend you book at least 2 - 3 weeks in advance as this is a hugely popular restaurant. Worth every penny

FOC has it all! The moment you enter the place you get an instant vibe of a fun place with a great friendly atmosphere. The staff are very welcoming always with a smile on their face. The decoration of the place is unique in Singapore, balanced mix of traditional Spanish culture with an edgy to side it.The food is fresh, superbly cooked and beautifully presented. amongst my favorite are: 1.The mushroom croquets - very creamy and full mushroom flavor.2.Grilled vegetables with Romescu sauce - powerful taste with the added flavors of almond and tomato provided by the sauce. 3. Grilled octopus - very soft, charcoal taste. 4. Gambas al ajillo, although not a massive garlic fan, these prawns are a must, the flavor they have is unknown in Singapore! 5. mushroom spaguetti - new addition to the menu, very smartly made spaghetti out of mushroom, fantastic mix of texture and flavor.For the deserts the chocolate galaxia is out of this world, melting warm chocolate with crÃ¨me fraiche profiterols. The creama catalane FOC style, is a great choice for those of you who want something lighter.The cocktail menu is impressive too, with a very smartly designed grid which allows you to chose cocktail depending on what you feel like dry/sweet/sour/bitter. FOC is a great place to go for a fun relaxed night out, the team there are great and make a huge effort to make you feel welcome, have fun and enjoy. Its a must visit for everyone living in Singapore

Dishes were presented simply as it should so you could see what's actually on your plate. Yet each morsel we took was an explosion of authentic flavor and goodness. Delicious! It reminded me of what real, well cooked spanish tapas should taste like. Four small portions later, I had to stop myself so I can come back again and again for more of my little spanish heaven in Singapore
4
The food and the service and food just right. Its difficult to get in to so book in advance. Will return again and again.

Very good spanish tapas especially the octopus and prawns. Personally the squid ink paella is one of the best that I had.

Highlights: good service staff; good atmosphere (despite the fact that power went out for a short period of time when i was there). Downside: very mediocre food.

Sit at the bar for a more lively experience and if you are in pax of 2-3. Decent Tapas which reminds me of Esquina and Lolla. Tired the highly raved Mushroom Croquettes and the filling was a creamy mix of mushrooms instead of an entire piece of 'shroom. Made it all the more sinful and delicious. The Grilled Octopus on Mashed Potatoes is tender and a must-try. Mini chocolate burger looks cute and instagram-worthy. But taste is pretty ordinary. As for the misses, the suckling pic had a 'porky' taste and ratio of meat to skin is 5:1. Would prefer it if the skin was crispier. Codfish Puff Fritters was another disappointment. There were no chunks of fish and it was just all cream and a hint of fish.

I was looking forward to my visit to FOC based on the reviews I have read but my first point of contact with the person who confirmed my reservation more or less set the dismal and average experience. I was told that since my reservation was at 7pm, I had to leave by 9pm as they had to turnover the table for the next group reservation at 9pm.... time limit was set for a dinner that has yet to happen... Not a good way to start. Upon arrival, looking at the full house of people, I was hopeful that this dinner was gonna be something. Drinks ordered were a great way to start.... reasonably priced, the concoctions were very good. The expresso martini was simply fantastic and I would return just to have it. Food was mediocre. The ink squid paella and the octopus was fantastic but the foie gras sliders and the prawn in wine sauce was nothing to rave about. Dessert was the Catalan Creme and that is something I would return to have, for sure!The service we received from our server Chelvan was professional and friendly. His recommendation of the paella and the octopus didn't disappoint and was spot on.All in all, the experience I had was average and I won't be running back to FOC anytime soon for a meal
5
I came for lunch with my colleagues on New Year's Eve. Food is awesome and the squid ink paella was our favorite. The apple pie with ice cream is good and something I have not tasted before - the mix of sweet n sour from the apple and saltish taste from the 'pan' served below the apple pie is just awesome.
2
Was excited to try FOC based on the rave reviews it has been getting. The valet service was extremely friendly and even offered to get my car that was illiegally parked and move it for me to a proper parking spot.We ordered the jamon iberico, the ham croquettes, the black rice paella, the pork belly, the octopus, chicken wings, the mini burgers, prawns with potatoes and two desserts being the chocolate burger and the applie pie. Other than the black rice paella, the rest were below average and rather disappointing given the countless reviews. The general ambience is friendly and conducive for gatherings of groups of friends but the food is definitely not worth the hassle and the price
5
It actually was my second time in that restaurant. This time I brought my parents. It was - like last time - just a great experience. The food is excellent and I have to say - there was literally nothing that was my favourite because every single dish was awesome. (Remember to chew a lot to kill all the calories!). The drinks are poetry! For the ones that like bloody maries - try the bloody jordi!!!! I could drink that one all day (of course I shouldn't coz there is Tequila in it). Overall a great experience

Dinner on a Monday, last seating at this new tapas place on Hong Kong Street. We loved the decor, the domino bar is definitely different. If you wonder FOC is Fire in Catalan, I think most of us thought it was name after the F&B term Free Of Charge. We ordered a bit of everything the Jamon Iberico was superb and a generous portion. The chorizo scramble was a little bit short on seasoning but we liked the approach to it. The beef cheeks were wonderful one of our favorites of the night. Big highlight were the Shrimp cooked to perfection and the pulpo a la Gallega The staff was super friendly but I have to say they did rush us a bit to put the order in, we understand it was late but a 9.30 pm seating is still a reasonable time to have a mellow dinner at a restaurant with such a big name chef attached to it. BUY ME A DRINK APP is all about the drinks but this time around we just had a lovely bottle of bubbles, didn't want to go the cocktail route when there were such high expectations riding on these tapas. Just for fun order the chocolate burger and don't believe your eyes..
