I like the place situated in Orchard road. The mall is not crowded (like most of others) and this is good for the ambience. Very good quality , if you want a Japanese ....quite in Orchard road...do not miss it.

I've come here 3 times and there are always Japanese elderly couples dining in. This says a lot about the authenticity of the cuisine. Service is good though not excellent. Quality of food is lovely.

We had 2 bottles of sake & ordered some items to go with it. Some items were OK but the grilled pork collar was not fantastic, it was dried & overcooked. Service was so-so too.

This place was absolutely delicious! The largest sake menu that I've ever seen by far and the sushi was so fresh and plentiful. If you find yourself on Orange Grove, this is a must!

Visited this restaurant a couple of times before this review. Situated at the basement of Palais Renaissance it serves an array of fresh sashimi, sushi and special fishes. The specials come with an ipad full of photographs. I had their nigiri sushi and tempura set for lunch. At $36++ in Singapore for fresh nigiri this is reasonable. It comes with Chawamushi and miso soup. Taste good. Servers will offer you their special fish and recommend their cooking. Had it formerly and it tastes great. On the high side though! It also has a good selection of sake and beers. A quiet little place on Sunday but can get crowded on weekdays and dinner

Fast friendly service. Restaurant is located in a quieter part of Orchard Road (basement of Palais Renaissance), so quite nice chill out environment. Seafood tastes so fresh and the grilled Unagi is out of this world fantastic! The Chawanmushi is the smoothest I've ever had. The Hokkaido corn salad, current promotion, is delicious! Overall, a very enjoyable dining experience. Two thumbs up

An izakaya at the basement of the upmarket Palais Renaissance. The menu is extensive ranging from sashimi, yakitori, cook items, tempura etc.. The highlight is the yakitori which span 3 pages of the menu. They also offer daily fresh seafood items flown in from Japan. Food standard was quite good but I think the restaurant emphasize more on the comprehensiveness of their offering VS top quality food standard. I was there on a Sunday night where the restaurant was quite packed and the service was rather slow. Sake list was extensive and price was on the high side. I think that defeat the purpose of an izakaya where the focus shall be on the sake/soju. Ambient was casual and relax. Overall a pretty enjoyable dinning evening

We went there for lunch and each of us tried different lunch set which is all good. The taste is really nice and the set is adequate. Sashimi are fresh and yummy. I had the unagi set with sashimi and i am happy. The price is reasonable. Atmosphere is nice. Service is good. Will definitely be back if i go to Singapore again

I have eaten at Ishinomaki about 5 times, each time, I am always blown away by the consistency and great taste of the food. I am starting to enjoy sake, and i love their large selection - even wider than some sake bars i might add! Of course, I can find a few labels at the nearby Isetan for very much cheaper, but it really adds to the experience to drink some unique sakes and eat the grill. Love the shirako i had the other time! SO FRESH! :

Had a great Beef Teriyaki dinner set this evening. Beef was excellent as was the sashimi and miso soup. Staff are friendly too.

After a long flight from the UK this was close to hotel and provided the perfect light and tasty Japanese meal that we were looking for. Fresh ingredients, beautifully cooked and presented.

I had a quick lunch. They have some set meal options for lunch. The place is not very big and has good atmosphere.
Sashimi was fresh and steam egg was smooth and soft. The meal was really good and difinately I want to come back.

I have been to Ishinomaki twice. Both times I had the chirashi. Can't comment on the other food as a friend had something with miso paste and found it too salty.I like the chirashi. If anyone suggests to go again. I will not hesitate. Price wise it's slightly more expensive than Itacho. But quality wise, freshness is unbeatable. I think chef is Singaporean/Malaysian Chinese. So surprising to get such good quality fish. I'm torn between whether to review and more people know this restaurant and the fact that I'm using TripAdvisor as my personal food diary. Had difficulty remembering the name when a few friends were trying to suggest coming here for lunch.

Had lunch there with family on a Sunday. The atmosphere was cosy, suitable for family meals, service was relatively good too.There were many set lunches to select from (depending on budget). Our favourite was the Sashimi and Grilled Eel with flavoured rice steam in wooden box ($32). The sashimi was fresh and the rice topped with eel was flavourful. However, the grilled items very expensive. The Japanese pumpkin in skewer ($4) came in 2 thin slices, and there were only 4 in a skewer for the Golden Mushrooms Bacon roll ($10).Will go back for their set lunches

I have been to Ishinomaki so many times that I have lost count. It never fails to delight me. Unagi, miso cod, inaniwa udon, chasoba, beef tenderloin, iberian pork, teriyaki chicken, chawamushi are some of my favourites. This is an unpretentious restaurant with quality food. Located at the basement of the classy intimate mall, Palais Renaissance, you get to be away from the hustle and bustle. I have celebrated birthdays and held business lunches here. If you want to get the freshest wild catch and also be surprised (i.e. not order from the menu), ask for the "black box" as they receive a "black box" straight from the fishermen twice or thrice a week. The chefs don't even know what they will be receiving. Think it takes real skill to know what the best way of preparing the catch is without knowing what kind of catch you are getting in advance. As you can tell, I love this place

Located along Orchard Road at the Palais Renaissance, this japanese restaurant is one of best that I have tried. Since they first opened, I have been making my trips to this restaurant diligently, and have never been disappointed each time. The service is friendly and the sashimi are fresh - the bara chirashi lunch set is a must order. I believe the other dishes on the menu are equally good but I have always been a sashimi lover and can't quite get myself to try the rest of the dishes but I will !Go try this place and do make a reservation.

Went for lunch with 2 friends. The chirashi bowl set is value for money. The fish is fresh. Not many people yet. So service is quite fast. I'll certainly visit again. Its tugged at the basement of Palais. Previously the basement is so dark. Now its bright. There're other restaurants like the popular Neil Road Xiaolong bao

We went on a weekday lunch and the chirashi was fresh. Place not crowded. Previously where Antoinette cafe was.Its now renovated and brightly lit. Found the chirashi set value for money compared to our previous favourite Itacho. Can't beat fresh fish. Claim they order direct from Tsukiji fish market.  Need another excuse to return. There's a Chinese dim sum next door.
