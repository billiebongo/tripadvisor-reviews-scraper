This is a nice restaurant close to the Al-Junied MRT station where you could get a decent steak for a decent price. It's not of the quality where you would take a dinner date, but for a casual lunch it would be perfect.

Few variety of food. We tried the beer. They only serve a mug not a pint. Mug is half a pint. Beer on tap only has Tiger and Heneiken.

Walking distance from Aljuined Mrt station...
Reasonable price... enjoy my cafe latte while waiting my friend coming...
At night also can have a cosy dinner or supper at this place...

Food was ok, service was ok, just had weird flavors on food not expected when trying to be a western restaurant in singapore.

A couple of my colleagues took me here for some late night food and drinks. We had several items on the menu and all the food was excellent. Guinness was the beer of choice and wait staff made sure our glasses were always full. I would highly recommend this place to anyone.

This is a nice place. I had the three course dinner special for $19.95. The mushroom soup was tasty, and my spaghetti bolognese was exactly what I felt like. The service was friendly and fast. Recommended especially if you are staying around this area and feel like eating some well priced and tasty western food

We were staying not far from this Restaurant and decided to try it. We are glad we did as the Steaks and Specials are very affordable. Checking the menu, there are many dishes to choose from so we will be back. It gets a bit crowded so pick your time of arrival as service gets slow once the crowd arrives. All in all, a very enjoyable time had. Thanks to you all

Located right at the end of the alley, there isn't parking space outside it. But it faces the walkway to/from Aljunied MRT station, so it's easily accessible. The crowd starts streaming in at about 7pm, and this restaurant takes reservation. Menu has a reasonable range of food: starters, mains, pastas, burgers, etc. There's also a drinks menu. Most, if not all, of the mains come with 3 side dishes eg wedges/mashed potato, salad, cold pasta. We like its casual atmosphere and friendly staff. We like its chicken mains, wedges, mashed potato, salad and spaghetti. The cold pasta is a tad tasteless, so it feels like a mouthful of starch. The pork chop with a rib is dry and tough, while the other meaty piece is succulent. Serving sizes are big. At an average price of $15, it's good value. Worth a return visit

I went to the Ranch with several friends and ordered the Menu Set at 25 SGD (49.9 SGD for 2 pers). This set includes a soup with garlic bread as a starter, a plate with spaghetti, buffalo, chicken, fish and lamb, one glass of lemon juice per person and one brownie to share. The food is not very raffinate but ok for students. We also took a bottle of red wine, which was brought in an ice bucket and served in champagne glasses... The wine was ok

Came here on a Monday night at about 9:45pm for a late dinner. Was told that can take the last order. Quickly scanned thru the menu in the dimly lited table outside. Ordered Ribeye Steak.Didn't think it would be nicely done as i can see that they are starting to close. There were people still chilling out with their beers and wine.Meal came in under 15 mins and I was surprised to see a well cooked meal consisting of hot wedge fries, fresh lettuces, portion of pasta and a medium done ribeye plus a small cup of pepper sauce.Steak was nicely cut, juicy and succulent. Didn't think they will pull out a good one at this time but they sure did !!This place is definately recommended to the tourist backpackers staying at Geylang near Aljunied MRT or locals looking for a chill place with quality affordable steak meal

Conveniently located right next to Aljunied MRT. Menu a nice blend of some of the local food and Western food. They have good set menus for lunch and dinner I believe.
Reasonable pricing for Singapore. Friendly staff and good fast service.

After hectic day trip to Orchard road we had a very enjoyable late lunch of fish & chips and chicken & chips, with a couple of draft Tiger beers. Well priced and very friendly and helpful staff.
4
Prices are OK 50SGD to eat two main curses and 1 liter of Tiger beer. You can eat both indoor and outdoor. waiters were OK and the food preparation was fast.
3
Main course and drinks are fairly good but the desserts left much room for improvement. The waffles and ice-cream were not tasty and I think they serve those instant/frozen waffles which we could buy from the supermarkets. Prices and atmosphere were quite good.
4
I stopped in for a couple of beers in the early afternoon.
Tiger beers are S$6 per mug, a good price.

Been there for 2/3 times with office colleges. Location is very good, just 2/3 mins walk away from Aljunied station. Clean and good food with very friendly stuff. If you love beer and if you love to drink at street side but quite place, then this place is best for you. Had Tiger Beer tower (3 Lt) and side dishes. "Thai Me Up"(chicken wings) is a must try

Went there for a baby shower and I thought the staff showed good concern for every guest. The young waiter recommended a Fish and Chips which I enjoyed while, my wife had pork chops.Halfway through the meal, my wife had to put my baby to sleep and the staff managed to give her another seat at a quieter place outside the bar. We were touched by their attention and care

It is a bit difficult for vegans to find good vegerarian food at a place which is famous for its steak et all.The Ranch is one such place where option is too limited...veg pasta, mushroom soup, hawaiin salad (dnt remember the name well..!!), garlic bread n nachos...precisely the only options for veggies. Limited options but fresh n yummilicious food..sumptious portion as well. Freshly squeezed lemon juice was absolutely refreshing. Basic but clean ambience...prompt service...at around 8pm also the order did not take long to come...the one point agenda of this no frill restaurant seemed good food and satisfied customers.The menu is extensive for the NVs n is quite popular amongst them

If you fancy a change from typical local food while in the heart of Singapore and want a more western taste, look no further. Ambiance is simple but welcoming and menu offers good choices in american sized portions. Set lunch menu is very good value for money and freshly squeezed juices are very good too. Recommended

I live next to the ranch and I really like the place .I have been there countless times and it does not disappoint . Of course, it's not fine dining, but if you are looking for casual western food served in a great atmosphere then the ranch is the place for you!!!I can highly recommend the SMS and the smoked duck : both my favorite.Enjoy !!
