Went to this newly open clay pot rice that is located in Serangoon Garden to celebrate friend birthday. The shop is not so crowded in a Friday night, however when we seated, they informed us that their clay pot rice would have to wait for roughly 30mins. We have ordered the 2 big clay pot rice, salteat ey will serve the other food faster, however they arrived at around the same time as the clay pot and we are very hungry since it is around 8.15pm already. Overall the food is nice, but price is a bit on the higher side and long waiting time. Highly recommended to try

I was a bit sceptical at first. clay pot rice worthy of a Michelin star? My mum said I was ho-mia to have palate fatigue...The thirty minute wait for the clay pot rice was worth it though. You can taste every single ingredient in the pot and the amalgamation of them all too. The best bit is the rice that’s left in the pot which begins to crisp up because the clay pot is still scaldingly hot. Really enjoyed it. Other highly recommended dishes are the har-jiong kai (shrimp paste chicken) and salted egg calamari - both were full of flavour and you don’t get the heavy oil aftertaste which you can sometimes get at other zichar places

Actually the food is really good. Love it!! The dishes are good and tasty - which is why my rating is high.But probably because they are still very new (just started operations not too long ago), there are many hiccups..... I will give them another rating next time when there's improvement.Firstly, lemme get it straight. No complaints about the food. So far so good.Drinks - they ran out of the the limited can drinks they offer! (That's ok, considering they are new, remember?)Seating/queue system - horrible, They asked to take our contact number and order and to come back 20 minutes later "so that there would be a table for us and the rice would be ready", she said. It was quite a warm day, so we decided to just hang around. To my horror, people set themselves down on tables that have just been vacated instead of following the queue. People before me (party of 6) came back (after "booking") and found there was no table but it was because the table was occupied by another party who had just walked in and sat down without pre-ordering. Basically, very messy system. So, I sat myself down (as soon as there was a vacated table!) and told the waiter i have pre-ordered. Thankfully, people are gracious because they are newly opened. Let's see some improvement in the system?Two days later, I wanted to order some things (for collection) but no matter how many times i tried to call, number could not get through (tried over an hour). Finally i drove down to order and to tell them their phone was out of order. He didn't seem to give much thought even though i told him i have been trying to call, perhaps the phone is out of order? or not placed properly? He didn't even check the phone!!?? And their system was for you to call before you come to the restaurant to pre-book?? Hmmmm...
