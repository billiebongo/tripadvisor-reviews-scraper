Highly recommended to both locals and tourists:) If you are in the Tiong Bahru area, this is a MUST try. It is very popular among the locals here in Singapore.

I hate to publicise Loos because it is already crazy popular among locals. My favourite local food and I am an Ang mo!

We went there for lunch. Ordered a few dishes and share among the 4 of us. The portion is okie. The food is not bad.
It is pretty crowded during lunchtime. This is at a coffee shop so no aircon.

Do strive to arrive before 12pm on weekends before all the good stuff finishes. The good stuff is like almost everything, but if I had to short list my favorites, it will be the sambal prawns, pork chops and fried spinach with mushroom.This is one of the few dishes where I actually polish off my entire plate clean and will eat rice as its topped with the divine curry sauce

Yeh another gem in Tiong Bahru neighbourhood, a long lunch queue is a common sight at Loo's but don't let that put you off as it moves very quickly.. and so does the incredible food! Hainanese curry rice was a unique innovation of Chinese Hainanese migrants (known as some of the best cooks in China) serving up their delectable east-meets-west dishes with Singaporean flair. That delicious curry sauce takes 3 days to make! Absolutely not to be missed

I love this curry pork chop rice! Pork chop, tau pork, curry cabbage. Toufu with minced meat. Even their fried egg is good. very oily! but tasty. Please order the pork chop, if u are exceptionally lucky to get piping hot one, the edges crust are ooo laaa laa. They are closed on alternate Thursdays. Eat and go for others to have the seat

Review by Dr Sim. Very Good Hainan Curry Rice. Very long queue during lunch. Self Service. No Air-Conditioner. No Ambience. Pigeons were walking around. Staff should chase away the pigeons. Better to buy home or hotel to eat. Try the Pork Chops, Squid, Pork Belly. Pork Chop was a bit salty but still good. A bit pricey for the food. Regards DrSim00

We came to this neighborhood to visit the famed Tiong Bahru Market and was so disappointed that it was closed for renovation (it should be reopened now...right after we left Singapore...sigh) That said, we ended up stumbling onto Loo's after seeing the lunch crowds wrap around the corner and onto the street. We ordered 'like the regulars': lunch for two: must have their Hainanese curry chicken, some bean sprouts and my personal fav: squid. Curry was not too spicy; but very flavorful. We left stuffed and satisfied

This is not a place to eat with your eyes. Food comes slobbered in gravy. But my, it was so good. Pork chop was super fragrant on its own. I had a piece not covered in gravy. Other big nods to are: squid, stewed cabbage, tofu with leeks. They say their curry takes three days to prep. In my head I was eating three day old curry. But this is not so. They sit the curry spices for two days and use it for cooking on the third day. Whatever it is they do, it was a fragrant thick spice-infused concoction. Other dishes are prepped with love too. The bittergourd fish head looked good but I had too much food on my plate already.Tip: they serve breakfast and lunch. Not much food left after 1.30pm

This is by far my favorite hainanese curry rice, do come early and expect the long line tho. Their pork chop is great and the curry is wellmade, mixed veggies and prawn also nice. and the price is very cheap , on average of SGD5 per person

Wonderful curry rice. Get the Shrimps and Pork Curry rice. Only Lunch no dinner service. Dinner it becomes a place for hotpot.

hainanese pork chops the sauce is amazing! you can meat balls, cuttlefish and vegetable to go with the rice. go early to avoid the crowd.

This place serves tasty pork chop drizzled with curry. Expect to queue up even at 11.40 am. But the queue moves fast. We were there this Thursday (26May). Do take note that it closes alternate Thursdays (2 June will be closed). Apart from the amazing pork chop, they are famous for the meatball and cuttlefish too

Simple, heartwarming, home-cooked goodness... Try the pork chop, stingray, braised pork. The experience isn't complete if your rice isn't soaked in curry and gravy. :) It's our weekly comfort food. Be warned though that the food piled up on your plate may not look very appetising. And eating at a local coffeeshop can be a very sweaty and uncomfortable experience. There's always a queue unless you're there before 11am. After 1pm, some dishes sell out. The stall shuts just after 2pm

This stall has moved to Blk 71 Seng Poh Road, #01-49 and is located opposite the carpark ramps of Tiong Bahru Market. Nice crispy thick pork chop compared to many places which served extremely thin pork chops. Chap chye, loh bak and squid are nice too. Long queues during peak hours. Not that cheap. Coffeeshop is small and can be quite warm during lunch

It's across from tiong bahru market.We were there at 1130am and there was already a long queue waiting (u order from the stall....)They serve hainanese curry rice (which is basically steam rice with a hainanese curry sauce poured on it). They have other dishes like curry chicken (different from the curry on the rice), pork chops etc.If you are not in the area. ..maybe no need to go..

Stayed at a nearby hotel, and saw the queues out the door. That night saw a story on this place on TV, so we HAD to try it out. It was good. Busy place and some of the options were sold out by the time we arrived, but we did get some pork cutlet. Very tasty and cheap. Worth a visit

Tiong Bahru has lots of food places and after seeing the lineup here and reading the reviews I decided to try it on my next market visit. I came just before noon and there was already a line up of 6 people. The line moves fairly quickly though so that isn't a concern, but finding a table to eat at is! You basically tell the server how many people you're feeding and pick from the vast selection. As I was eating alone, he scooped rice on a plate and then gave me the cabbage, pork chop and squid I requested. The sambal prawn was sold out for the day. They put 3 different types of sauce on the rice and you pay up. I believe my meal was $5. The squid and pork chop was okay as was the cabbage but not anything to rave about. I could probably cook the same at home. The sauces were also okay but again not anything I would have to eat again. Sorry can't be more positive. If you're in the area and hankering for curry, then try this place, but there are better places to eat. I won't be making a return trip

Hot, fresh, fast and filling. I saw a queue, l looked to see why, so l lined up and ordered the pork chop, squid & cabbage with curry poured over it.It was quite an experience and at less that 4 SGD it was a superb value for money meal!Great
