I had my dessert in this place. Very delicious classic hot chocolate and a slice of Black Forest cake. Nice place to sit and have dessert here.
5
Generous portion, unusual flavours.
Try the After 8 flavour. Enormous head from an outstanding rise, beautifully crafted.
Excellent service and friendly staff. We will definitely be back!

We have visited this glorious little gem twice in two days & I think that sums it up! The desserts are more expensive then some other cafes but in my opinion definitely worth it. We tried the triple choc cake, pure chocolate cake, lemon meringue & our absolute favourite... creme brûlée!!! They were all incredible & so were the ice creams & friendly staff. If you want a luxurious end to a busy day of work or play... Laurent Bernard Chocolatier is your place!
5
Really good chocolate place with plenty of options, from cakes to drinks. The 3 chocolate cake & cream brûlée was 5stars!! Suggest you try this place for desserts after your meals around the area. The service is fast, they could be a little slow in tidying up the tables. Otherwise all good!

On of the most amazing chocolate tarts ever! Perfect pastry shell and perfect chocolate filling - rich but not too rich and not too sweet.The lemon tart looked great but was a tad disappointing. We had single scoops of the ice cream - Pistachio, rum and raisin, caramel and coconut. Our favourite was the caramel.Cafe latte was nicely done but served in a small cup with a non-ergonomic handle which doesn’t allow for a good grip
5
So in love with their chocolates that I bought some home as well! Move away Godiva, this is my new love
5
The desserts are consistently good . Pure - the dark chocolate dessert is superb and consistently good . The mango passion fruit gelato was delicious - had the right amount of tart to it! Must visit place.

Beautiful place on Robertson Quay... Lovely ambience.. Delicious food.We were there in the evening and that helped. Most of their seating is outdoor and might not be a pleasant place to sit in the heat. It's a good place for families to enjoy. Being a no traffic area, children were playing around, while the parents relaxed. We had coffee, tea, hot chocolate and a couple of their desserts. They were all great. Service was a bit too slow.
5
I can't find the words to describe how much I loved the chocolate pie here. Let me put it this way: I am not a big dessert eater, but this here chocolate pie has changed that. I can't rave about it enough. If you're in Singapore, pay this charming little chocolatier a visit and give yourself a treat

We had always had wonderfull experiences at Laurent Bernard chocolatier's counter at Takashimaya and the cafe at Heeren over the years. They serve the best chocolate cakes and hot chocolate (at the cafe), and of course the freshest (and the best) chocolates you could find in Singapore. I never thought of writing a review since we had been acquainted for so long. However, having been all over France and Belgium very recently, and having tasted (and re-calibrated our taste buds) chocolates from almost all of the top chocolatiers, I just wanted to say thank you to M. Laurent Bernard. Thank you for deciding to make your home on this little island. His chocolates are the best in Singapore

they have nice chocolate, cakes and gelato.. you can tell that they're using high quality ingredients. the cafe is by the river, really nice to chill.. service was okay, staffs seemed to be indifferent.

We were having dinner at robertson quay and wanted to save space desserts. Did a google search and laurent cafe turn up to just a few units away. That's where we headed. We ordered chocolate tart, creme brulee and a cup of double scoop ice cream. Very friendly and helpful staff. My son ask to try out 2 ice cream flavours and the counter staff obliged. He then ordered one of the flavours and chose another. The place was well patronized and crowded as it was saturday. The next time we go to robertson for dinner, we drop by again to try their cakes too. Looks very good
5
We visited after dinner one evening and just ordered coffee. While expensive by Australian standards, the coffee was superb and the little complimentary chocolate cookies were to die for. Just be warned - a large coffee is REALLY large
5
we had a wonderfull experience at Laurent bernard chocolatier, they serve only cakes and pastry, but they are the best. there is no doubts about the quality . the tea is excellent too, i had the Bali which i recomend.it s a great place to chill out

Sunny Island of Singapore, on one of my walks down at Robertson Quay came across Laurent Chocolate.. I was pleasantly surprised by the huge selection of cake on display 'Chocolate with Hazelnut' base. Freshly baked. The Manager Mr. Damien Fourett was really helpful, friendly and eager to assist. The staff was really friendly and attentive.Highly recommended for this outlet to anybody who visiting Singapore, especially Chocolate Lovers :

My wife bought a chocolate cake with layers of crunch. It was awesome !!!! Had to eat it slowly to enjoy the small piece that I got. Sad that we had to share the cake with others. Need to buy a bigger cake next tim
2
As a French, We had a dessert there for the 5th time and this time we took an equator cake. It was dry and old. We asked to change for the Trianon which we used to eat and it was equally dry and not fresh. For a $10 per piece this is not acceptable. A disappointment for this high end chocolaterie.
5
If you can't decide what to order, then go for their hot chocolate. Ask for their classic, thick one. It's heavenly. In fact, it's all I remember having in this place. I may have had some other chocolate dessert. (Did I have their chocolate cake as well? Did I have their chocolate truffles? Who knows? All I remember is their hot chocolate.)I plan to go back just for that
4
This Chocolatier is predominantly selling chocolate and desserts. They have macaroons and praline available too. The coffee and hot chocolate tastes good. The chocolate cakes are really delicious
5
I love Robertson Quay. It has a vibrant feeling but it is not as noisy and crowded as neighboring Clarke Quay. So the fact that Laurent Café is located here is in itself a thumbs up to this dessert place.I love the variety of desserts, tea, shakes/smoothies and coffee to choose from! I don't drink wine, but there are fine choices there too. There is something for everybody here, whether you have a sweet tooth or prefer the non-sugary option.I love their soufflé. It has the right moistness into it, complemented by a nearly crisp outer texture, made even more delectable by the vanilla and ice cream that is elegantly served with it in an artsy black wooden tray. I don't think I've been here many times enough to try everything they have to offer, so I keep coming back!But one more important reason I come back here is, aside from the superb desserts, it has a quaint, tranquil ambience that enables me to catch up with friends, talk for hours; and, not be bothered by the hustle and bustle of partying crowds around. Even on its fully-packed day, Laurent Café Chocolatier manages to maintain its serene atmosphere and it never feels too cramped.P.S. Also love the takeaways that can be bought here, like the bars of chocolate stashed on the side of the shop; and, the inviting pastries on display right in front of the door
5
I absolutely love love the chocolates and desserts here. Good quality and oh so delicious. Casual relaxing atmosphere. I highly recommend this place.
5
Super chocolate.... super desserts to die for! Worth a visit and a repeat visit of course! Been there twice already over a span of 6 months. Just as good each time. Good service too. However, be prepared to pay premium prices for good stuff.
4
Great place for dessert post-dinner and stroll by the riverfront of Roberston Quay where this is located. They take pride in ensuring highest quality of their chocolates while desserts when enjoyed alfresco under the stars and cool river breeze, are heavenly OOO...
5
If you are a chocolate lover, this is the place to be. They serve very delicious drinks, desserts and pastries made with chocolate.We had the Chocolate soufflé, which was very delicious. It was not too sweet too
1
The chocolate soufflé is alright, took about 30min and came with raspberry sorbet - quite nice. A bit heavy indeed and also the soufflé seemed to be more liquid than the latte I ordered after a while.The service was quite upsetting though - the European manager gave us an out of no where entitlement and quite rude - when we were ordering and also when asking if we want to add anything after we sat down.Well I won't go back - you think you are too good to make my money well fair enough. If you are really too good for opening a chocolate shop here why come to Singapore - for reasons I guess
5
Loved the cafe and its ambience. Ordered 2 dishes.. Both were yumm. A nice place to go and chill out and have pastries and desserts
5
If you're craving for anything with molten chocolate or just very rich, gooey chocolate, this is the place you want to be. Great hot chocolate, tarts and souffle. Wish they're open a branch in Orchard/City Hall area so I don't always have to make a jaunt to Robertson Quay every time I'm looking for a fix

Consider how many outlets Laurent Bernard are actually capable to open in a small country like Singapore, I guess his focus is clearly retail. While their pastries and chocolate are clearly not the best (especially when F&B is tremendously competitive in Singapore), their service is not only non-existent,But plain old rude, arrogant and horrible. No wonder why their reviews are all.so.consistently.bad.Actually, I'll take back what I wrote above. I can't even see how they can even be retail-focused when most of their products are not on display. They expect customers to just cruise in and make purchases without even bother to provide information on how the product looks like. I just went to order a christmas chocolate log cake. Not only did they not have one on display (which is completely fine), no photos are available. When enquired, Laurent Bernard himself, as the BRAND that represents his products / outlets in Singapore, simply shrugged very rudely and arrogantly without saying a word, as if I am wasting his time. That was followed by slamming the glass door at my face (!). No wonder why this outlet is constantly empty. I guess he is probably just frustrated.Well, to Laurent Bernard - sincerely wish you a good year ahead, as you guys may truely need it with this kind of service you are providing. Never go there unless you have a fetish for bad service

They only have a few selection of cakes - but they're all made with good quality chocolate! Everything is delish, especially their variants of hot chocolates. Dessert prices are quite on the pricey side (S$16 and up) but the drink prices are at par with coffee chains - Starbucks etc
2
Ordered 2 hot chocolate a l'ancienne and a plaisir. They have changed the way they make the hot chocolate- It was premier earlier - now they give you 2 large cups of milk and you have to put the chocolate in and mix it. Does not taste as good anymore. Plaisir - what I considered the top pastry which they have also is way too sweet Standards have dropped - second time this is happening to me - not coming here agai
5
Went here for desserts - absolutely fabulous - chocolate indulgence - well worth the visit!
Situated amongst other restaurants and bars so go here for your desserts!
5
This little place in Robertson Quay is such a treat -- amazing little chocolate cakes, and chocolates...and coffee and tea...did I mention ice cream? Always good service and a fun way to end the evening on a sweet note.
4
Nice place for dessert and chocolate after dinner... Yummy. Really enjoying the place and excellent service at the joint!
4
Overall a good choice of cakes, chocolates and ice cream. It's a place where you won't touch any highs, but you are quite guaranteed you won't reach any lows either. If you are in the area and in the mood for a dessert, this is the best choice
5
Stumbled across this little cafe a few years back after dinner at Aburiya. Now make this our after dinner stop for great coffee, sorbet and absolutely amazing chocolate and lemon soufflés. Light and fluffy yet packed with flavor, definately worth the wait. Nothing like poking the soufflé and covering it in rich, thick vanilla cream. A must have if you are looking for dessert or an after dinner coffee
4
First went to Laurent Bernard at Robertson Quay 3 years ago when we moved to Singapore. My favourite dessert there is the Plaisir - which I have pretty much every time I visit. Went this week with a friend but felt the place was slightly below its usual standards. The Plaisir was good, but a shade little too sweet - earlier it was just about the right balance. Still think it is one of the best pastries in Singapore and would still recommend it for anyone who likes sweet chocolate pastries as opposed to the dark chocolate types
3
Several dessert option, from fine chocolates to ice cream to an assortment of desserts you can share among 2. We had Black Forest and strawberry cheesecake. The Black Forest was the best of the two. The cheesecake tasted a bit like the freezer but was otherwise good.There was one disappointment and that was the staff. Four people working and only two couples as customers, yet no welcome and asking how we could be helped nor a good bye and thanks when we left.
4
Was in the area and popped in for dessert. It was pretty full and we got a table outside, fully enjoying the relaxed atmosphere this place offers. Service was good and their menu was interesting and definitely so chocolate. It may seem, however, that the cake was a little dry but that was easily overlooked by the rich chocolate inside the warm chocolate cake served with whippped cream and vanilla ice cream. A great place to indulge in
4
Staff is nice and helpful. The restaurant itself is simple and relaxing.You can seat outside, by night it's pleasent, the view is not amazing but still ok.Concerning the food, definately the chocolate is awesome, so you can close your eyes and choose whatever pastry with chocolate it's delicious.Main course was ok, duck well cook but could be more genererous with the potatoes..

I used to visit French Chcoolatier Laurent Bernard for an occasion indulgence in its chocolate truffles and pastries and I am delighted to be able to taste its exquisite chocolate mooncakes this year. Each of these chocolate-loaded "mooncakes" contained zero lotus paste and a unique flavour core that matches very well with the type of chocolate. Encased in a delicate chocolate shell, both the Milk and Dark chocolate Mooncake sat on a beloved crunchy hazelnut praline base contained a gooey salted caramel fondant. I especially adore the Dark chocolate Mooncake as the intensity of the cacao accentuates the sweet dash of caramel. Somehow, the image of an elegant, miniature version of Pierre Herme's Plasir Sucre surfaced in my mind as I savour them slowly. The White Chocolate with Champagne Ganache and Strawberry Pearl was too sweet for my liking and the taste of champagne was overshadowed by the sweetness of the strawberry compote. However, the quality of the chocolate consistently shines here just like the rest of the chocolate mooncakes, with an alluring smooth and shiny texture. Last but not least, Japanese Green Tea Mooncake was highly enjoyable as there was a surprise crunch from the black sesame seeds that was blended into the green tea chocolate. In addition, the zesty passion fruit compote provided a desirable switch of taste.  Though these up-sized chocolate pralines might not be traditional, they are still delectable sweet treats that definitely go well with a cup of tea to enjoy during the Mooncake festival. And they probably save you some calories accumulated this season. Visit user's blog under profile for full post and pic

Went there with my daughter for an ice cream and a chocolate. The ice cream was ok and the chocolate was good but not outstanding, yet the cost was high end. Not good value.
4
Love the souffle, totally worth the wait! Cakes and coffee were really good too! Would recommend the rum baba, though its not always available.
1
Visited the cafe in the afternoon around 4pm. They had a sofa setting for 8 people outside where only one person was sitting & when we asked the waitress whether we could sit there if the person was ok with it - she flatly said NO. Then when we looked inside there was a small table for 4 empty and as we were going to sit another waitress said that this is a table for 4 & as we were 5 we could not sit there. I asked them if they can do do something to accomodate us but the attitude was pathetic & the staff just shrugged & said that there is no space. When I said to them that they should be more accomodating it made no difference.This is the 1st & the last time that I visit this place & will certainly not recommend the place no matter how good their cakes are
4
I highly recommend Pure (about $9), a chocolate mousse cake made of 70% dark chocolate. Very light, slightly bitter, not overly sweet. Pure heaven. The tart tartin (about $9) is a reverse apple crumble. A thick layer of caramelised apple slices, flavoured with cinnamon sits a top a light cake layer. Its paired with vanilla ice cream. Delicious!The teas are quite good and they are served in little pots with generous amounts of loose leaf inside. They also provide hot water refills, and plain water if you need it
5
I went in just for dessert and it's the chocolate souffle. I've been looking around Singapore and only manage to find this place that serves it. I love the souffle. Right from the often, it's quite big so I think unless you've got a sweet tooth, it should be shared. The souffle came after a 30minute wait and preparation but it's known this dessert will require a wait because of the preparation. But once served, it's totally worth it
5
4 plus baby arrived at 2 PM and requested the omelette, which was not on the day's menus (may be a weekend brunch item). Because my son and his wife had been there before and raved about them, we asked if they'd make them and they did! These are not your typical omelette! More like a soufflé and fabulous! Don't order an appetizer as the serving is quite large (we had no room for dessert even though we'd planned on treating ourselves to something decadent). Also, the non-alcoholic drinks were creative and incredible. Not inexpensive but truly, a memorable, leisurely luncheon. Wish I was staying longer so I could go back
5
We discovered this place purely by accident and it became the place to go after dinner and a stroll along the river.The homemade icecream was great but the chocolates were divine.Stop in for coffee and cake or dessert or just to pick up a selection of handmade chocs
4
Very nice place to visit to have great pastries, french people are the best dessert maker.I have lived in Singapore when Laurent Bernard was a newcomer to Singapore food scene, now is business has grown and that's good.The multi layered pastries and his soufflés couldn't be better.The price ? No issue, and moon-cakes are also very expensive..
5
My husband and I went in for tea, and went out feeling like we had the best mini-vacation ever. The chocolate desserts made here are petite, delicate, and completely delicious! They look great when served by the cheerful staff, and they taste even better. We love sitting outside on the sofas and taking our time with tea and a small chocolate mousse dessert with raspberry gelato on the side. We feel that we could be in Paris, but with Singapore temperatures and sunshine
4
This little gem of a cafe was more or less next door to our hotel and so we went a few times after dinner for dessert. The first night I had a gorgeous apple cake with ice cream and a decent pot of English Breakfast Tea. The friend I was travelling with had chocolate truffle cake and as an official chocoholic I believe her when she said it was amazing.The atmosphere is very laid back and the staff pleasant and helpful, if a little slow at bringing the bill. Robertson Quay is much quieter than Clarke Quay so this is a good place to chill out after a long day
5
I had a pastry, some chocolate and a home made ice cream and everything was magnificent.
4
Great when weather cool to sit outside and people watch. Wonderful desserts and chocolate delights of course.
4
The Dulce de Leche is good, ice cream not so good. Bit pricey.
5
Good quality chocolate. Delicious tasting. Great place to go for a very satisfying snack or to take away chocolate and cake for gifts or to simply indulge yourself at home! Price reflects quality of chocolate. You get what you pay for.
2
Uniquely good, but pricey. Crowded on the weekend (hot date location)
2
The souffle is decent. The chocs are nothing compared to Hediard, although the yuzu lime choc is quite ingenious. Could use a bit more in the tempering process (melts too easily in the sweltering heat).
4
We enjoyed the slice of Europe in Robertson Quay. The ambiance of the area is great. Personally I don't understand how somebody could give this place a "2" rating just because it was crowded. It's crowded because it's a great place. The chocolate is not overly sweet so you don't feel sick after eating it. Great place to stop by while walking along the river after a nice dinner at one of the nice restaurants in the area
4
Went for desert after having a meal close by, it has to be said some of the best chocolate ever tasted, not too sweet and not too bitter, my husband had the brownie I had the pure cake, they both tasted fantastic but my only complaint is the price and thank goodness water is given out free in this part of the world $34 for 2 cakes is a bit steep
4
Someone at my table said it was "the closest they'd had to French hot chocolate outside of Paris". I can't personally say how close it is, but it certainly is good (as were the icecream and cakes).It's in a busy part of Robertson Quay, and the tables are a bit squeezy, but you do get the fun of people-watching with a Whisky Bar on one side and a Belgian bar on the other.When the waitress noticed we'd fetched glasses of water from the water station for ourselves she brought a fresh jug over for the table without being asked. Maybe my expectations are really low these days (I was in a cafÃ© in Tiong Bahru last week were they told me they "didn't serve water") but I though that was a really nice touch

i travel times to times to Singapore, i live in Europe. I was so glad to find this place, chocolate is awsome, even in Europe it is rare to find a place like this. if i could i will take it in my suitcase. i had chocolate ice cream, a souffle and bough a box of chocolates. The ice cream was perfect i had it with a grand marnier souffle baked to perfection. The service was polite and friendly, athmosphere was very relax. i just wish to return to Singapore more often
