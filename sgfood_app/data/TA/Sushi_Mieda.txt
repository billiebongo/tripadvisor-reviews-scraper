We tried this place four times, it never disappointed us. The sushi is very well done, fresh fish and nice rice.

Also thoroughly entertaining!
Can’t wait to go back and taste the snow crab

Very pleasant meal with some interesting creations and sashimi served. We used a discount voucher otherwise it would have been really pricey.

It was an awesome experience and my client had commented the food was very fresh. So far he eaten several Japanese food in Singapore and he found that tuna here was very fresh.

This is among best n top sushi counter restaurants in spore. But be prepared to spend esp dinner else coke for lunch but book ahead. Chef Ohno..always ready to please with freshest seafood. Yes bring your favourite wines to complement as restaurant has right glasses.

I came here for the view, the space and peace and quiet. It was very relaxing to have an omakase meal while enjoying the slowly changing view. The food was competent although I would say not as fine as that of Shinji. Service was above average. I would come back again not so mouth for the food but for the whole package - food, view and an escape from crowds

Normal Omakase restaurant. Very good service coming in. The Uni dish didn’t have enough uni. The service was a bit slow as it was one sushi chef serving 3 couples. Didn’t clearly tell us we had to pay extra for the fish eggs they served. Very nice view.

Although my reservation was already confirmed, the restaurant manager called me 10min before my reservation to tell me the restaurant 'couldn't honour' the reservation because there are too many guests and they are afraid they cannot manage. I had to convince him to honour it by explaining that my guest had traveled quite a distance to reach (and even then he was quite resistant). This left a bad taste in my mouth before I reached. To his credit he introduced himself to me when I arrived, but I think he should have apologised and tried to make up for the poor customer service. The restaurant didn't seem too busy when i was there. Focusing just on the food and value, not much care is taken in preparing the food. It's also not good value for the price. The other famous omakase jap restaurants present better value, from personal experience.

Excellent quality of food and service but pricey for what u get. Even with the $190 set, I didn't feel full. We've had similar good quality sushi at other high end restaurants but at a lower price. I guess we were paying a premium for the rotating view and exclusive location.

The food was a great experience. Much of the sushi texture and taste was nothing my partner and I have ever tried before. The service was great, being responsive and friendly. The chef even informed us when there were fireworks happening outside the restaurant, which allowed us some time to enjoy the fireworks before returning. Terrific

There were very few customers or almost no customer when I visited but they put us at a section at the end that seems like a storage area.
The sushi is nice but food is overpriced.
We took the omakase set.

Small counter seats for about 8pax. But there are table seating with fantastic view of Padang and MBS. Very nice arrangement of fresh fish prepared by the Chef. Will definitely go back with my hubby and friends!

Had the omakase lunch. Chef's attention to details is commendable. Fresh ingredients which is well explained by the chef & attending waiter. Small joint but cosy & clean.

Sushi Mieda is hugely under-rated and a must visit destination for lovers of excellent Japanese Cuisine. I was blown away by the quality, and the immaculate attention to detail. Worthy of a Michelin mention at the very least

This has become one of my regular client entertainment venue. Their food, service and ambience is exceptional good.

Access to this restaurant is through the Tong Le private dining - a Chinese restaurant . ( Both are run by the same group )The sushi restaurant itself does not have a view , as it is a sushi bar concept . Ask for a table in the main dining hall if you want a view .The Sushi and sashimi is fresh and quality is high . But if you are with guests who are used to more conventional Japanese fare , the choice is limited , not to mention pretty high for lunch ( from S$80 for a lunch set ).The good news is that you can also order from the menu of the Chinese restaurant . Our guests from London ordered the Chinese set lunch . The S$60 set lunch comprised of dim sum, a main course and dessert . They were v good . Did I mention that this is a revolving restaurant ? In 100 min, guests get a really good panorama of the skyline . It makes for conversation .The restaurant was not crowded at all . I have a feeling that it has to do with the pricing as there are other options in the vicinity . Maybe the service too - we had a few surly people that afternoon .

Below is the feedback I sent to the GM about our bad experience. Till now I have not heard back from the management. -------Dear MichaelMy wife Josephine and I dined at your restaurant yesterday to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We wanted to express our extreme disappointment and unhappiness to you in person, but since you were too busy to talk to us, we decided to write to you instead.We heard about Sushi Mieda through your promotion on JPassport. What you had advertised was a SGD190 omakase meal for SGD100. We soon realised that we were served a reduced menu. This is dishonest marketing, and one that is bordering on fraud.The food quality was ok, but certainly not up to a top tier restaurant quality. What really got us were the serving sizes - simply too little and cheap. And we are not the only ones feeling it. Read you Facebook page - you will find other patrons commenting having to eat cup noodles after dining at your restaurant.The service was adequate for a cheap diner, not a fine dining restaurant. We can even hear staff chit chat amongst themselves in and out of kitchen.To make matter worse, when we asked to see the manager, we found out that there is none. Adrian is overseas for 2 weeks without a replacement, and you were too busy to speak to customer. All your server would do is to take down our feedback in a most condescending way.Just for your information: we have enjoyed ourselves frequently at Mikuni restaurant in Raffles City, with much higher quality food, 2X the servings, and â…“ the price. Try it and you will see where your restaurant stands.We contemplated walking off and refusing payment for such disappointing experience, but decided to be good diners. We paid, but only most reluctantly. It really spoilt our evening. We would ask for a refund, but that's entirely up to your business conscience

I came with my sister for our birthday dinner, and used a promotion for an omakase dinner for two. The food was great, but it did not fully sate me. I probably should return when I am ready to put down more cash for a wider menu.But the dishes served were excellent just by themselves! I truly felt that I did not have the tastebuds to truly enjoy these dishes: the chawanmushi is highly praised and I do agree! It looks simple but tasted more complex than I expected. The sushi was a real highlight as it had fish my sis and I never heard of, but we savored different textures of fish in one go. My sister, a usually careful and picky eater, admitted that she would usually never choose most of the fishes served but she loved the variety. She also loved the texture and taste of the sushi rice, a usual finicky point for herself. I gobbled the sushi down too fast to enjoy all the flavors. The rest did not stand out as much as these two dishes did.However, it seems like if I had only one chance to truly enjoy this place, I should put myself at the chef's table and do the true blue sushi omakase dinner. Maybe one day I shall.P.S. If you're trying to find this place and getting a cab here, it's right next to the Fullerton Bay hotel. Alight at that place, and look for the miniature version of Changi Airport's comms tower or a little tower that's a UFO on a pole. It's really really close to the hotel's vicinity and just past the stairs of the overhead bridge. This is necessary because the address is not easy to find on GPS and cab drivers could get confused

Overall our experience at Sushi Mieda was really nice. We had nice sake and a good set lunch. The only disappointing part was that the menu set is for 7 pieces of Nigiri Sushi and I only got 6 pieces because I don't take Tamago. I told this to the staff at the beginning who told the chef in front of me but when he placed the tamago down as the last piece of "sushi" and I declined to eat it, he gave it to my husband but didn't replace it with anything. For the price of the set, I thought this was rather cheap. I don't believe tamale should be considered "sushi" anyway. Maki isn't considered sushi so why is tamago? There's no fish.
