Nothing fancy just a place for very good thai Sunday lunch for family and friends. Portions are in good size. Liked the esarn Tom yum , mien kiam, cham on.

very authentic, good flavor and portion Thai food. Good quiet location.
check their E-sarn soup.
only small improvement is the ventilation needed as clothing does not smell good after the meal.

The food is ok. A clean and comfy space. Not a bad place for a quick meal. Even though the restaurant is not busy, staff there seem to be quite used to clean out tables the minute customers pay.

Been a fan for a few years of E-sarn Thai and the staff are super warm and friendly. They have the best Thai Green Curry Chicken, whether you want it mild or spicy and the portion is worth the price. Highly recommend!

I was walking around Upper Thomson area and i chance upon this Thai restaurant, so i decided to give it a try as i love spicy food.I ordered a bowl of Tomyum Chicken Clear Soup with White rice and a Seafood Vermicelli Salad. Moderate spicy for the soup but it was delicious and same goes for the seafood vermicelli salad(abit too spicy for myself). As im alone and i cant finish ot try the other food but i will be back to try other dishes. â˜º

None much for atmosphere but great service. Descent place for dining. We ordered basil beef, which has generous gravy portions and very succulent and well seasoned, the grilled cuttlefish was cooked al dente and perfectly grilled, not rubbery at all. Tom yam prawn was nice and avail in clear broth or red chill oil. Thai tea wasNot too sweet and refreshing. The red ruby was crunchy with sweet coconut milk. Overall very good. We been here numerous times. So no pictures.

This E-Sarn is located at the Thomson Ridge along the Thompson Road area which has multiple food outlets.Had the Thai Milk Tea which I enjoyed. Shared dinner with friends with a couple of dishes (Green Curry Fish, Basil Chicken, Thai Salad).Food tastes alright overall but no 'wow' factor. Average from my perspective but the place is quiet and enjoyable for socialising. Staffs are reasonably friendly and helpful.Place is kept reasonably clean and spacing between tables are good

I would say that this place serves pretty decent Thai food at reasonable prices. The staff are very attentive and accommodating and for me, the best part is that it welcomes families with young children and you know how messy young children are and the staff don't fuss about the place being messy after a meal. Go for the herb and mango salad, the grilled pork and steamed seabass which are all pretty good. The Thai iced milk tea is also very good
