It is not so easy to get a decent burger in Singapore. This beef burger tastes way more better than the normal standard American burger. The prices are affordable , the service is good.

It's definitely better than a Big Mac app least the meat tastes like meat !
Good selection of sides. The portobello mushroom burger is over priced ; stick to the classic burgers , they're good value for $

I normally avoid burger meals cause they tend to be too filling and sometimes hard to get through. But it has been some time since my last so I ventured to try Burger Up @HillV2 for lunch. There were a few other diners and hence rather cosy (not noisy). Had the Bacon Butty Burger with Coleslaw side. The beef burger has the usual ingredients plus one not so usual (egg). The taste was well integrated all-in-all. The mushroom soup was not bad. If anything the coleslaw was just normal. I would not hesitate to visit again should I need to burger up
