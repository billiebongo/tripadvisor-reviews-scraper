Truly dreadful. I very rarely leave bad reviews but this was something else. Like instant noodles in cold Campbell's canned soup

Had truffle ramen and black garlic ramen which are both excellent. Like the firmness of the noodles as well.

The service staff was helpful and service was prompt. The food was delicious. Had a good dining experience.

The truffle ramen here has a good truffle aroma and taste that I found just right even though my brother found it too strong

The taste of the noodles were something unique and different since I ordered truffle ramen when I was there. However, the portion is a little too small.

I've had better ramen but the ajitama is the bestttt. Only one server who is the cashier and the one cleaning tables so service was pretty damn slow.

Nice place, not too crowded. The service crew is really nice as well. Enjoy my first trip there, the truffle ramen is üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ

Innovative pairing of an onsen egg, chewy noodles and slices of truffle. Really quite gorgeous: worth the visit!

This is probably the cheapest truffle dish one can actually get for under 20 bucks (that's actually substantial). Granted that this may offend ramen purists but cannot deny that it's tasty!

We went there at 6pm on a monday evening, expected it to be packed but it was nearly empty- only two other tables were filled. The waiter was quite 'bochup' (indifferent), didn't greet us or say a single word when we were seated and given the ipad (for ordering). The drinks ( Ice green tea and water) came quickly and the ramen came around 10 mins after we ordered. The sides (gyoza and chicken karaage) however took longer than expected and arrived when we were halfway through our meal.We ordered the Kanshoku Ramen, Black Garlic Ramen, Spicy Tonkotsu Ramen and Shoyu Ramen.The ramen broths were quite thick and fragrant. We felt that for the price, they could have added maybe half of an egg too. The portion of noodles were just right though! Not too salty, but as you get to the bottom of the bowl, the saltiness will build up in your mouth.Nothing special about the chicken karaage and gyoza. We felt that the amount given was too little and not worth it.You can actually see the chef making the noodles in the shop when you walk past the window that looks into the kitchen, which was interesting!While we were eating, the waiter was peeling hard boil eggs at the table behind ours. Bare hands and even had a ring on... I don't think that is very hygienic... Would have given 4/5 if it weren't for the poor service

The best thing here's the truffle ramen. Springy noodles in a rich, truffle-infused sauce. Will come back just for this. Unfortunately they dont have the truffle soup version that's served at their other branch. The other ramens are average.

truffle ramen tasted a little like truffle pasta but not too bad for a ramen shop
pork bones soup however was a little lacking in flavours
4
Near to StarVista but away from the crowd. Food is simple but authentic. The place is Neat and quiet.Good for solo diner

Food are normal but expensive then others ramen restaurants. No combo ramen it already cost $16.00 without drinks.
Not recommended to this restaurant

taste was good, the ramen could be hotter and that will be better. Portion was average, add in side dishes to make it more filling.

My daughter and i came here during a weekday lunch hour. Food is decent, it comes with the ramen, gyoza and ocha. Unfortunately, they don't tell you if its vegetarian or pork gyoza....
Overall a pleasant lunch experience despite the lunch crowd.

I agree with the reviewers that the Truffle Ramen is excellent. I was early for an appointment and decided to eat at Kanshoku on impulse. The ramen was a little al dente, the black truffle and truffle oil fragrant and unique, and the two slices of pork (japanese char siew?) was cooked to perfection. I ate at the Orchard Gateway Mall branch and will definitely retur

My colleague recommended us to try Kanshoku Truffles Ramen (dry, no soup given). Therefore, we decided to try it for our lunch. 5 of us ordered their truffles Ramen. When it was served, you can smell the strong fragrant truffles smell. Mixed well with the egg yolk and it tasted fantastic and delicious. Never regret to have it! We will definitely visit again and I have shared it with my friends and colleagues too

There's two branches, one in Buona Vista and one in Orchard Gateway. I went to the Kanshoku Ramen bar in Orchard Gateway and had a truffle oil ramen and a signature ramen. First thing's first, the price of the ramen could be reduced slightly as some customers might feel that they're priced out at $16.90 per bowl! The signature ramen was at $13.90 if I'm not mistaken. Either way, price aside, the ramen was amazingly delicious. I've never really had ramen with truffle oil before, nor have I ever considered it to work. But it definitely works! This is definitely ramen worth trying. The Orchard Gateway branch was full of people. despite it being a Monday afternoon that I paid a visit to the restaurant, which definitely shows how popular it is. For the signature ramen, the broth was thick and tasty, and all in all a very good charshu ramen. But I'd stick with the truffle oil ramen if you want a new dining experience! Strongly recommended! Definitely worth the try, and honestly speaking, worth the $16.90! :

We went to Orchard Gateway outlet. We did not know what to order as there is no picture on the menu. We asked recommendation and they recommended truffle noodle and karaage chicken. The food came out quite fast despite many people in restaurant. The noodle was excellent, small noodle and taste of char siew pork is great. Karaage chicken came with mayonnaise sauce and water melon on the side. This restaurant is also a bar, they also serve alcoholic drink like beer.
