Nice authentic Sichuan food at reasonable prices. Friendly and efficient service. The 3 chilli meals are really hot, loads of chilli. Wast down with a good beer what could be better in Chinatown.

This is our favourite Sichuan restaurant in Singapore. The quality of the food and the service is amazing. We always go here atleast once in two weeks... and sometimes in a large group. We've tried most of the dishes, so you can't really go wrong while ordering. There are also a lot of photos on the walls, so you can see what you want to have.If you "check in" using their FB page, you'll get a 10% discount too.... Happy Eating ! You may need TUMS to ease the spice (for the light hearted folks

What a surprise! A simple, but clean and dedicated place in Chinatown. After the often a bit dull food in Australia (my favourite country!) stepping into this taste and fragrance extravaganca was a revelation! The fried greens were spectacular in their garlic and fresh chili balance. Very crispy, tasty and crunchy.The star of this spectacular show was the squid. A point! Not stringy, very tentackly soft and tender with an absolutely devine tomato and sweetchili herby sauce. Heaven! Elegance! Taste! Real!My wife’s duck dish was faboulous! Not very ducky, but tenderly sweet with a superb sauce and some fantastic chili to taste.Incredibly friendly service from great Filipino people, superb Guandong chef. An unbelievable place! Very friendly prices. If you miss this in great Singapore......Going back tomorrow!10 stars

This place is full of locals which is always a good sign. The food is amazing!!! We have been back time and time again since moving to Singapore. Portion sizes are huge so order to share is my advice. It’s clean, simple and the staff are friendly.Extremely reasonably priced in a city that is generally not

Recently heard about this restaraunt.. and we had no idea that one can get such yum Sichuan food at such great pricing.. complete value for money.We ordered mushroom claypot, egg fried rice and stir-fried duck.. followed by pumpkin pancakes for dessert - its tuff to actually rate the dishes - they were all simply superb.Our 3 year old also enjoyed the food :

All fatty, greasy and certainly not suitable for non-locals used to this kitchen. We love Szechuan food in China and Hong Kong (eg the Mask), also in Amsterdam, so expected a lot.Price was not too bad but we returned the frog legs, steamed chicken and fried eggplant nearly untouched, paid the bill including the sissues (yes, seperately charged) and left very disappointed and with a sore stomach, stil troublesome the following days..

pros : food is pretty decently priced. bigger than average portions. wide selection of choices on the menu with nice pictures. food turned out pretty good, better than i expected actually. good value if there is a big group so you can try more dishes. there were only 2 of us and we could only order 2 dishes and the szechuan soup. the sliced pork dish was much too spicy and oily -full of chillis. cons : pretty noisy - guess cos it was dinner time and service isn't all there. we were charged for rice which was not served, so we had that taken off the bill. average on the whole.. next time, i'll probably try the less spicy dishes and bring more friends. if you want to try szechuan food at low prices, come here

I have made bad choices in my life like that perm in the 1980s and going to this restaurant was one of them. The food was just bland and expensive. The pork I ordered was more fat than meat. One dish I ordered never arrived but appeared on the bill. The rice was restless and fruit juice nasty. The dumplings were not good and I am struggling for the right adjective but needless to say they were about as good as the fruit juice. Staff ignored us and when we did get their attention the first waiter walked off mid-sentence. Biggest shock was the bill and I was charged 60cents for a napkin. Won't be returning.

no mistake. the restaurant is full of local chinese people looking for the spiciness of szechuan cuisine.the place is noisy, the decorum is simple with food posters on the wall.the service is excellent.the food is really authentic. I love the food there but I am not Chinese. that's what our friends local Chinese say about it.highly recommended if you are fine with spicy Chinese food

After such amount you can buy 1 meal for 1 dollar, nice offer for family.
Free wifi also offered with good speed
Over all it is nice place to have lunch or dinner with family on vacation

That craving to eat spicy is satiated here! Absolutely love the spicy chicken and the dumplings! The stuffed peppers and noodles are something I haven't eaten anywhere else.
Its always packed on weekends. Food is worth visiting for.

The food are not bad here. U can come here as a group as the portions are quite big.....at least min 4 pax.. Price is reasonable

I tried the noodles, dumplings, the famous sichuan chicken and the steamed fish soup. Luckily I came with a local friend who spoke Mandarin/Hokkien. Menu is in English too so it is easy to point at the pictures in it.

We went to this place every night after work while I was in Singapore. The staff are friendly and always made us feel welcome after a long day at work.There is a variety of food available and everything I tried was delicious, I can personally recommend the spicy clay pot potatoes if you like your food spicy

Simply amazing food. So glad we found this place as I've been hunting for the best Sichuan for a while (very uncommon niche where we live) and this is it. Also the spiciest food we had on our entire trip throughout Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore, after unsuccessfully BEGGING other places to make our food spicy for us. Portions are huge and prices are cheap, so plan on sharing.

Keep coming back here, keep getting visitors to Singapore here, keep loving it. Expect a large menu with bbq, claypot, fired stuff, noodles, fried rice, veggies, and all kinds of meat and some seafood. There's plenty that is not spicy, and for the spicy ones you can ask them take it a few nothces high or low depending on your threshold. If you like spicy food, I'd recco telling them that and asking them to make it medium to high spicy. Open till 6am, which is brilliant. Has Chinese beers like Tsingtao and Harbin, as well as coconut water. And a good bunch of folk serving you.

Actually we had gone out ot Chinatown for a meal and had already chosen another restaurant in the same road - Si Wei Mao Cai - but when we got there we were put off by the noise, the queues. We could see the food looked good even if a little pricey. So we walked down the road (plenty of choice) and stumbled into the Sichaun Village. My wife looked a little displeased at first - plain surroundings, plastic tables and plates BUT a lot of chinese. The service is not 5* - your dishes come when they are cooked so its better to order a variety of food that you can all share and be very specific about what you want first from the kitchen. That said, we went for some classic dishes and of course I could not resist the chilli crab. You will not be disappointed by the food - its excellent! Has to rate as my best chilli crab in Asia beating even Sri Lanka (on the beach in Trincomalee - my #2) and the Seafood Market in Bangkok (my #3)... The prices are for the locals - in other words ridiculous. Go and enjoy real HOT and SPICY authentic Sichuan food at very fair prices

If spice is your thing, knock yourself out. This place can dial up the chilli factor as much as you want, with a large menu of Sichuan and other dishes, with the fagara (peppercorn) sure to get you to whistle at least in some of them! Of course, there's many thing sans chillies as well, so there's something for everyone. but I know the most conservative of friends still warily dipping into the spicy dishes!There's babecue, hotpot, claypot, meat, fish, vegetables, and fair bit of customisation for vegetarians. Our usual order includes:any (or all!) of:Diced chicken (can do a potato or 'french fry' version too!). Spicy cucumber salad (with peanuts)Cucumber with garlic- a good counterbalance to the fire. Dumplings (pork with cabbage or chives)Pork chopsClaypot potatoSour & Spicy potato floss (shredded potato) Cold sichuan noodles (there is also a soupy sichuan noodles)Garden veggiesEggplant with chillies (not spicy)You can tell them if you want it only slightly spicy or very fiery and it usually comes that way :)A recent addition is their all-nighter status (open till 6am)!Enjoy

very basic get up. they concentrate on the food. the result is mouth watering. both because of the heat and the taste. the food is very hot - not all of it though. the taste is just too good and very authentic. the best dish on offer is the chilli oil stuff and the different meats with cumin. the tsingtao beer is also the best accompaniment with the sort of food on offer. the place is not expensive at all. most certainly a repeat visit. if you want to wake up to life then this is the place to go
