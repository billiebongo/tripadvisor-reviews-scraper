Quite a big menu with plenty of choice. All the sets come with free soft drinks, ice cream and hot beverages. I've been to this place a few times and found it good. The only issue being that they don't have much vegetarian options. They should include a few more vegetarian items on their menu to give a choice to people who don't eat meat

This restaurant serve decent food and the set come with freeflow of drink (including soft drink) and ice cream!! And the price really not expensive considering you no need to worry about your drink and dessert. Can get very busy during dinner time since a lot of family will visit this restaurant

Tried it yesterday and the food was really good. I love that they're offering free flow of drinks (softdrinks, coffee and tea) and ice cream. The food are reasonably priced as well and the serving size is okay. The staff could be a little friendlier and warmer.I would definitely go back to this place
