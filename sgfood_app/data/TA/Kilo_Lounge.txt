Unfortunately not enough competition in Singapore for quality nightlife.
Either way Kilo wins hands down. Quality house music, awesome space, good drinks, nice crowd.

In a city like Singapore it is difficult to stand out... but this place is definitely interesting... give it a try... and if I can suggest you a cocktail get a Screwzudriver (yes, it's not a misprint) !

Came here on a Friday night after being out in Club Street, KL had a great atmosphere, it was a deep house night and the tunes were on point. Service was attentive and the dance floor was big, me and the boys had a great night, will visit again

Kilo Lounge is a very cool bar/lounge, and serves amazing food. They operate a couple of restaurants, but the menu at 21 Tanjong Pagar is delicious, and is basically comfort food done right. A MUST TRY are the Cheesburger sliders - brilliant, with double beef patties. Reasonably priced. And the lounge itself is very comfortable. Excellent music
