Enjoyed myself thoroughly from start to end. A pleasant staff that took care of us and made us feel very welcome at all times. A very special and humbling experience, where we were served extremely tasty food (12 dishes) by such a lovely waiter that made us laugh all the time and made this experience extra special. I really would recommend NOX for those who want to have a nice evening with good food and friendly staff or if you just want to challenge your senses

We finally made it to Dining in the Dark after hearing about this concept for a few years, it can be hard to get last-minute bookings, so do reserve early to get a slot that you want! Definitely an experience to try at least once in your lifetime, though the dining area is indeed pitch black, so it takes a bit of getting used to. The unexpected bonus of this dining experience was, we got to try certain foods which we normally do not order or choose, since you are not shown the menu and you can't see hence you can't judge. The food was good in fact. So, yay to new food choices

If you guys looking for unique dinning experience, you should give a try Nox- Dine in the Dark... amazing experience...highly recommended and reasonable price with good quality of foods.. very friendly staffs (especially Ruban, Theresa and gang)..fyi,waiters in the dark room are blind ppl..

We originally heard that there was a Dine in the Dark restaurant in Singapore through friends of ours, who had been taken there by locals. The concept was one that I was intrigued by as I wondered how much our sense of sight impacts on our enjoyment of food. Our friends, FYI, are not particular adventurous when it comes to food, so the fact they not only recommended it, but raved about it, meant that it must have been good.From arrival to (a very late end due to the number of incredible cocktails we consumed), the service was of a standard that is rare in restaurants. For a start, the people that worked there actually genuinely seemed to love what they were doing. Everyone from Jose, the manager, to Joshua, our waiter, made our dinner a very memorable experience. You are assigned a waiter, who is blind or partially sighted, and they lead you up an ever darkening staircase. This is done by placing your hands on the shoulders of your waiter, and forming a human train as it were. Once through the velvet curtain, you are guided to your table. The fun then begins, as following your waiters instructions, you try to find where things are on the table. And no, you really can't see your hand in front of your face, it doesn't matter how hard you try! Essentially, it is a tasting menu, with four dishes in each course. The food is arranged on a wooden platter, and starting at 3'0'clock, you work your way round the four dishes.They don't skimp on the portions though, as there is a good four to five mouthfuls in each dish which means you finish all three courses feeling sated, rather than full. Perfect then for enjoying a cocktail, or four, downstairs afterwards. The food is phenomenal. And the fact that the menu changes every 4-6 weeks means that this is no gimmick, but that it really is all about the food. I'd also recommend the wine pairing as each glass really does work in harmony with the food.And the eating in the dark thing is an experience. I realized I most definitely do eat with my eyes - it's probably why I will nearly always over order! So it did take me a while to adjust to not being able to appreciate visually what I was eating. That said, I did really pick up on the textures and flavours a lot more, and there was definitely a lot more conversation between my husband and I about what we are eating, and what our favourite dishes were. Cue the quiz! After your waiter brings you back down the stairs (the only part of the experience I did not enjoy, mainly because I was worried my husband would stand on the back of my dress and send me flying down the stairs!) you are seated on the sofas and asked to fill in a short form about the food, as well as try and identify some of the dishes and their main ingredients. I really enjoyed this part, as you got to see how good your memory was! I was pleased to see that I got nearly everything right, apart from the accompaniment to the foie gras - I won't tell you what it was, but all I'll say was a) it was incredible, and b) it would spoil the fun if you're thinking of going.  Last, but not least, you have to have at least one of the cocktails. Here I'm blaming the potency of the cocktails for being unable to remember the names of the bar guys, who produced some of the most incredible cocktails I've ever had - and I've had a lot. Forget Wolfgang Puck at Marina Sands - although they are good - these cocktails were another level of creativity and taste. My recommendation is definitely the Dirty Movie. All in all, this was four hours of the best food and drink I've had in a long time. And actually not that pricey considering the cost of a beer and a burger in most places. An absolute must try. I just wished we had one in Hong Kong..

Brought my gf here to celebrate her birthday dinner, and it was truly a unique experience to dine in total darkness. No watches, bags, mobiles allowed as you have to place it in the given locker before dining (or any items which portray forms of light), which also removes all sorts of distraction to allow 100% communication and focus on eachother while you eat and guess the food that consist of 4 x appetizers, 4 x mains and 4 x deserts (but all in smaller portions which are chopped into small pieces for easier consumption)All diners would also have a personal guide who would bring you to your seat and assist you in darkness. Joshua was our guide for the day and despite of his disability of sight, he was a true gentleman, bubbly and cheerful and we enjoyed his service and assistance (Thank you once again Joshua!)Somehow after the dinner, made us appreciate life more with our sense of sight as well. Highly recommended for couples and food is pretty awesome too! Thank you NOX

Totally worth it.Great fun, awesome food and a very very interesting experience.Totally recommend it to everyone

A few weeks ago I was looking at something to do for Valentine's day. After finding out that me and my girlfriend were both busy on Valentine's Day and the weeks before, I had to make my reservation for January 26. From start to finish the environment was great. I new the concept before hand but I kept it a secret from my girlfriend. She seemed well prepped for the evening after a waiter introduced her to the concept and gave a brief explanation of what was gonna go on. Eventually we were greeted by our waiter, Joshua, and he took us up into the pitch black dining room and seated us. Every meal we had that night was extremely good, and even my extra picky vegetarian girlfriend enjoyed every dish. Whenever we needed help, we would call for Joshua and he would come and help. At the end of the night, both me and my girlfriend has eaten enough and we're both very content with the quality. I highly recommend the NOX experience

We do not normally enjoy giving negative reviews unless it is absolutely necessary to share with others. In this case, we feel compelled and also sad to have to do so. We have been to this restaurant 3 or 4 times in the past few years and the standard of the food has gone down from a “good” to “dismal”.The experience of dining in the dark is definitely a very interesting and enlightening experience; we would highly recommend that to anyone!However, it is a real pity about the food in this place and the lack of consistent standard of training of the staff for service and management of the place. When we called up to book, we told them what type of meats we could and couldnt eat. In spite of that, we were just thrown the vegetarian option. That would have been overlooked if the quality of the food was even vaguely anywhere near good. In the past, we have had the non-vegetarian option and the food was better though, not fantastic. In fact, we recalled that the vegetables served as being pretty good and hence, we were initially ok with the vegetarian option until we tasted it. It was very uninspired and we are sad to say, downright awful.  The starters and a third of the dishes were fairly decent but for the main course, we had what tasted like boiled cauliflower with pre-packaged dried parmesan cheese sprinkled on top, microwaved (?) soggy pasta with what tasted like a pre-mixed packet cheese sauce and another mushy stodgy type dish which slips our mind. Cocktails are pretty flavourful though it tasted more like mocktails. If there was even a thimble of alcohol in it , we would be surprised. It was a very expensive $300 lesson and experience. When we booked, we also emphasized that we would like this to be a surprise experience for a friend we were going to invite and to please not give it away until we got into the dining area. (We requested this before last year and the staff members then who were working there before were very attentive to that request and made sure our friend had a good experience and surprise.)However, this time, even after reminding the lady who attended to us upon arrival to keep it a surprise, it was plainly and blatantly ignored and she just went on to harped about the ‘safety’ issues.  Now we fully understand this, however, we mentioned to them that we had already checked with our friend to see if she had any fear of darkness or claustrophobia issues upon taking her there and she plainly did not. We would advise the management to give customers some credit and trust as to our judgment and intelligence in this matter. It’s very simple: In the highly unlikely event that any customers have any issue with being in the dark, it’s an easy case of leaving the place. We trust the waiters to guide us safely and so far, all the waiters that have served us, have been very calm, patient, confident, polite and know their way around.A handful of the staff are very helpful and attentive to our feedback at the end which was an unfortunate case since the dinner was supposed to be a treat for a friend’s birthday which ended up with us feeling like or tasting of a soggy damp rag, which we had no other choice but to laugh about after. So, overall very disappointed since this is a place we like to invite visiting friends but may have to consider other options in the future. We love to support local businesses but unless they do anything to vastly improve quick and soon, if you want to experience dining in the dark, maybe try one in a different country

Lovely food and service. Tough call on the dark atmosphere - makes for an unique expereince, but the food is so good, I almost wish I could have seen it as I ate it
5
The staff were fun and friendly; the food was delicious; the environment was ... pitch black. We enjoyed the teaser appetiser downstairs and all the food upstairs. Our waiter was Bernard, and he was attentive and good-humored. The dining room was alive with activity, from the sound of it. We could carry on our conversation amid the sounds of the wait staff moving through the room. Each had his own "call sound." Was especially fun afterwards to compare our interpretations of the menu to what we actually ate. A fabulous evening
5
Amazing experience with excellent foods that way exceed my expectation. The service crew are well trained and provide marvellous services. Definitely will revisit again!

It was most certainly a unique experience! Staffs were friendly and customer oriented as well. Location is rarely accessible, walking distance from bugis mrt

I brought my husband to NOX for his birthday. The guest officers are friendly and delightful. Our server is Joshua and he made us feel welcome and comfortable. Joshua is very attentive to our needs. Joshua made the whole experience better. A few things that I thought can be improved.. maybe the guest officers can check the remarks/requests during reservation and double confirm with the guests on site. Also, I think the guest officers forget to share with us what were the 3 wines served and also what were the ingredients in the 3 mocktails... Other than these, we are happy that we visited NOX and would love to come back
5
had been recommended by friends to try Nox dining in the dark...and have to say i was not disappointed when i chose this to celebrate special birthday with one of my best friends.great customer service from the staff, particularly Kumar at reception, and our server Joshua who were very attentive. they were very accommodating in catering to my special dietary needs. the experience itself was like none other I've had in all my travels. dining in complete darkness, with only your 4 senses of smell, hearing, touch and taste to guide you through a three course 12 dish menu. the first challenge was parting with our beloved smartphones, which are not allowed in the dining for obvious reasons. then the fun of learning to navigate the table, dishes, drinks and cutlery without fumbling. once we overcame this, the real culinary journey began, with a surprise at the end of each spoonful. i cant recommend this dining experience enough...best shared with close friends for an unforgettable dining adventure

The meal to celebrate the new year with my son and his wife, visiting from UK. We wanted something different and memorable and NOX delivered on both counts. The food combinations had us all guessing which kept the conversation lively throughout
5
Whole New level of experience. The food was fresh and tasty. One had to rely on their taste buds and smell only. The service was excellent. I would love to visit again but is a bit costly so I might have to wait for an special occasion to visit again. Went to celebrate my bestie belated birthday and were ushered into a lounge where we orders for drinks. We were asked if we had any allergies/preferences or didn't eat any particular kind of food. We were asked to keep hour phones, keys & bags away in a locker provided for the same. We were asked to go to the rest room before proceeding upstairs for dinner. We were introduced to Hafeez who is visually challenged. He led us upstairs with us forming a train staring with one of us placing both hands on his shoulders and being led upstairs. The lights slowly started fading into darkness as we ascended the stairs. Our drink were served and 4 small bowls of appetisers, 4 mains & 4 desserts. Was told to have our first dish from 6 o'clock 9 follow by 12 and lastly 3o'clock ,the portions are small but the meal was filling. We couldn't see a single thing totally. Me and my gf tried bringing up our hands up close to us but still couldn't see. We chatted and ate as we usually do and the main focus of the conversation was to guess what we were eating relying solely on taste and memory. It was brilliant but very nervous in the beginning but soon became morecomfortable. We felt for the dimensions of the table and the distance between us etc. Hafeez was attentive and we couldn't imagine how he served us without spilling anything. At the end of the meal Hafeez led us downstairs.After the meal we were given a sheet of paper to with questions such as what were 6 ingredients you could taste during the appetizer etc. The hostess sat with us and showed us pictures of exactly what we had eaten and we were surprised to see some familiar and unfamiliar items. We were all happy with the experience. The staff including the chefs are what make this place unique and exceptional. Excellent!

Went to Nox, dining in the dark. Was a really interesting experience. Waitors are all visually impaired and really commend them on their excellent service. Do however think its heavily over priced for what you get.
5
⁃ It’s an awesome, one-off experience to try. We both felt it was something we would recommend to others⁃ Nox employ vision impaired people as their waitstaff which is WONDERFUL. Jose told us that the majority of their staff are late in life blind and are often struggling to find a direction again after such a significant life change. Our server (Hafiz) was absolutely fantastic, he apparently use to be an air steward for Singapore Airlines before a detached retina caused his vision impairment. Nox also employ their staff at a “normal” Singaporean wage and pay the equivalent of what we Australians call “superannuation”. That’s a big deal. I was really happy to hear that and also impressed with the honest response to my (rather rude!) question about pay– The food and paired wines were tasty and well matched, the dessert wine in particular really adapted to each option within the set dishe

This was an unparalleled experience. The food was fresh and tasty. One had to rely on their taste buds and smell only. The service was excellent. I'd love to visit again but since it's expensive I might have to wait for an occasion. We went there as a family of 3 adults and were ushered into a lounge where our orders were taken (for drinks). We were asked if we had any allergies/preferences or didn't eat any particular kind of food. We were asked to keep our phones, keys & bags away in a locker provided for the same. We were asked to go to the rest room before proceeding upstairs for dinner. We were introduced to Hafeez who is visually challenged. He led us upstairs with us forming a train staring with one of us placing both hands on his shoulders and being led upstairs. The lights slowly started fading into darkness as we ascended the stairs. We were served our drink and 4 small bowls of appetisers, 4 mains & 4 desserts. the portions are small but the meal was filling. We couldn't see a thing and I tried bringing my hands up close to my eyes but still couldn't see them. We chatted and ate as we usually do and the main focus of the conversation was to guess what we were eating relying solely on taste and memory. It was brilliant and we loved it and the dark which was unnerving in the beginning soon became comfortable. We felt for the dimensions of the table and the distance between us etc. Hafeez was attentive and we couldn't imagine how he served us without spilling anything. At the end of the meal Hafeez led us downstairs.After the meal we were given a sheet of paper to with questions such as what were 6 ingredients you could taste during the appetizer etc. The hostess sat with us and showed us pictures of exactly what we had eaten and we were surprised to see some familiar and unfamiliar items. We were all happy with the experience even the one who went in with scepticism and trepidation. The staff including the chefs are what make this place unique and exceptional.

One of a kind experience having a meal in the dark and being unable to look at anything. The food is purely determined using our taste bud and imagination! was indeed surprised to know some of the food that i have eaten. I even had a different impression for some of the food which i thought i do not like the taste last time. NOX have indeed impressed me with various food combination to make it such a delicious meal
5
Felt a little scared as i entered the dark... however the experience was very different from what i have tried before. It allowed us to taste the food without looking at it while enjoying each others’ company. To me, it was able to let me feel how it was like to eat without vision. However the waiters are very nice and attentive. I admire their ability to serve food and drinks, whcih was something i took awhile to get accustomed to. However, i would say although it was completely pitch black, each of us knows how it is like
4
The food is excellent! It is a special dining experience where you can really focus on the taste of food without handphone or eye sight distractions.
5
The food was delicious and it was SO FUN to guess what i'm eating! I love the ending where Nox will "unveil" the pictures of the food to you - the plant that looks like maggots but tastes like potato was definitely a funny surprise! A perfect birthday gift for a loved on
5
Do you remember a time when you felt utterly helpless? Do you remember a time when you have to surrender all control? Do you remember the time that you let your taste buds teach you?In NOX, that is exactly the experience you will have. My partner and I were led to the second floor of the unit where the main dining around was done. As you walk up the stairs, you feel helpless. But under the expert guidance of Joshua, we were led to our table.What took over next was a series of gastronomic onslaught. From the appetizers, through the main course and finally the dessert. What makes it interesting is that you have rendered only your sense of taste to lead you. The dishes are playful as you sample them bite by bite, spoon by spoon. You might think it is chicken, but it might be duck. You might think it is beef, but it could be venison. Your tongue is just led whimsically through the chef's lively nature in his interpretation of the different dishes.And once you are done with your dishes, a kind waiter would lead us back in reality, where a waiting staff tested us about our guesses before revealing the secret behind it all.If you are looking for a lovely yet mysterious dinner date for your partner and yourself, NOX is definitely the place to go.Furthermore, they are supporting a great cause, enabling the visually-impaired individuals through jobs and a heart of concern
5
There is a lot to say about this restaurant, first of all I want to highlight that if you book for this restaurant, you need to look at it as an experience, not only a simple dinner...We have been very very happy with the results.The food is alright, nothing to die for, and you can have much better food in some classic restaurant all around Singapore, however, eating in a pitch dark room, and awaken all your other senses to kind of try to discover what you are having, makes the food much better !!!Being "blind" during this experience is a truly amazing sensation and I would recommend everybody to at least try once...The service, done by blind waiters or with vision issues make this dinner even more special as this put you directly in their shoes, and if this doesn't touch you emotionally speaking isn't normal...If I could rate this experience it would be 10/10...Thanks a lo
5
The food was delicious and the portions added up to fill our tummies. To dine in absolute pitch darkness was a real experience! We had fun guessing what we were eating too. The service staff was very friendly (
5
Interesting theme restaurant with an excellent dining experience.5 stars service from the staffs with lots of fun.Quality of food was great.A place to remind oneself of how fortunate when all 5 senses are still available
5
Had a wonderful dinner experience yesterday with my partner.1. Food: Awesome quality and variety. We had 4 dishes with each course, a total of 12 dishes for 3 courses. Each dish was crafted to give a different experience with no repeated ingredient. It was like 12 mini-courses versus 3 courses. Variety aside, the taste was excellent with and we were challenged to identify the dishes.2. Service: Excellent service by the staff, friendly, responsive and proficient in their duties. The waiters/waitresses ensured we were well-briefed regarding the whole process and guided us through the whole process in the dark. Food was served promptly and skillfully despite everything being in the dark. (large amount of background noise/movements)3. People: Special thanks to Assistant Resturant Manager Kumar for accommodating to my request to propose to my partner after the meal. He went out of his way to coordinate the service staff to bring me out multiple times to prepare the surprise and made it possible for us to be in the lounge at a quiet time. His staff even helped picked a suitable song to play in the background to create the mood. He and his team are a really fun bunch of people who will go out of the way to make your day.Overall Rating: 5/5 Would returnSide note: Eat slowly and enjoy your food, or you might miss out enjoying the ingredients with delicate taste

We came here very excited for the concept! You walk in and have to lock up your belongings in a locker. You have the option to select a wine pairing with your dinner, which we did. Soon after they escort you up a dark staircase and sit you in a pitch black room. They serve you 3 courses & have to figure out how to eat them in the dark. Super fun and unique experience, however the food was very underwhelming. Very bland dishes, unimaginative flavors and boring textures. This was truly a shame given that so much could have been done with the concept of sensory deprivation, especially when you consider all the flavor profiles available in south east Asia. Food aside, the wine was undrinkable. We took one sip and left the wine alone, which we have never done before. Finally, at the end of the meal there was a mandatory wait of an undefined duration to due a large group that just left. Giving up one of your senses voluntarily and temporarily is one thing, but being forced to sit in the dark against your will is another. Finally, the staff at the end asked for feedback. When we mentioned the wine they nodded and proceeded to charge full price, for bad wine that we didn’t drink. All in all, interesting concept, poor execution, mediocre service. In a foodie-paradise city this is one to avoid.
5
We were a group of 15 and had an amazing time dining at NOX. The staff were friendly, helpful and a lot of fun. Dining in the dark was an amazing experience. Its not just dark .. its pitch black. The food was excellent but the highlight was Hafiz, the person waiting on us, who managed and served us brilliantly. We came away having had an absolute blast as a group and yet humbled in many ways by the likes of Hafiz. Its not often these go together. Hats off to NOX... will surely be back
4
Very special dining experience worth to try once. Food was good but some dishes might not be up to your liking. Portion was just nice but not very full. A bit turn off when food was revealed after the dinner and the part of the meat is not to your liking
5
Our second visit to Nox.....and just as good as the last time. From the moment of walking thru the door we are made welcome. Our waiter was just amazing, he knew what we needed before we did!!! The food is fantastic, the quality is terrific and the twist the kitchen puts on things is something to behold. Thanks to all for another great experience.....see you again when we are next in Singapore
5
Great experience. We had some time awaiting to be seated in the bar, so we had a drinks, which were very good. Than we've been taken to the upper floor where the restaurant itself. We had very polite and caring waiter, who was giving the hints about the food. I would recommend to try it at least once
5
Nox was a great twist to dinner. I have heard of other “Dine in the Dark” experiences before so I was excited to try it when a friend came up with the idea from Trip Advisor. Nox provided exceedingly good service from the beginning to the end. You will try a variety of appetizers, main dishes, and deserts. You can choose to add wine to the dinner as well. The servers are all legally blind which is neat and provides them with a rewarding career as well. At the end you guess what you ate and they keep score for you. We did okay! It really makes you appreciate your other senses. Really fun dinner with friends.
5
Full marks for the experience.When you enter the restaurant, you are asked to sit in a pretty lobby area and briefed about the procedure. You are also given one appetizer to eat.Then you are introduced to your companion for the dinner, who is differently abled and cannot see.You enter to the staircase where you and your companion are equal now coz you can’t see anything not even your hands no matter how much you tryYour companion helps you climb the stairs and make you sit.We booked for 3 course meals starters, main course and dessert along with wine pairing.You eat each meal in set of 4, so in total you get to eat 12 dishes in small portions.You have to tell your dietary requirements at the reception like no beef or no pork.Next adventure is you don’t know what you are eating , so the guessing game begins. Our companion was very supportive and provided us great service.At that situation you feel and understand how difficult it is for people who can’t see.I was really struggling to eat in the dark coz I couldn’t see my food or the cutlery or the wine glass.The companion helped to settle us in and to get familiar with the surroundings.After your meal, companion help you to go downstairs again.Later restaurant ask you for feedback and show pictures of the food you ate, which is quite surprising coz you guessed it all wrong LOLI really loved the starters and desserts.Overall great experience

Took partner there to celebrate a special occasion. From the very start, friendly welcome and briefing. Very much enjoyed the experience!

As the name of the restaurant states, you would dine in the dark. Great experience. You can inform the staff of your dietary restrictions if there is any. You would not be able to bring any light emitting device like your handphones and watches, so you would go back to the good ole days of having conversations with your partner instead of taking pictures for your social media. It is a 3 course meal, with bite size portions. Each course have 4 different types of food to taste. Overall it is one of a kind experience and it would be great fun guessing what you are eating. Once dinner is done, you would be shown the food you have consumed
4
Firstly, it’s worth saying that it’s definitely in the pitch black DARK. We weren’t sure whether you’d be able to see a little light once your eyes adjusted but nope!We were led up stairs by one of the blind/partially sighted hosts. It’s worth saying that all the team at Nox were excellent!You’re encouraged to guess what you’re eating and then you get to see the dishes at the end. A great laugh trying to figure certain dishes out.The food was tasty but for me a little heavy and unbalanced as a menu. The cocktails are all quite sweet too which didn’t help, not sure they were quite paired exactly as planned.That being said, the food overall was very good and the experience excellent. Not the cheapest meal but you realise why at the end, when they talk through some of the ingredients.Very surreal but brilliantly unusual dining experience that I’d thoroughly recommend
5
For all who need a new experience, you have to try NOX, dining in the dark. You will find how quickly the senses for texture and smell ratchet up.We were a party of 5 plus 2 children. One with a food allergy. Pre-dinner drinks at the bar brought up to the tables, Proseco and wine during dinner, handled by NOX's wait staff by the table, all visually impaired, effortlessly. Kudos to Hafiz!Chef's pairing of 4 dishes over 3 courses was excellent. Hands down was Fois Gras with 'guess what' for appetiser, Wagyu with 'guess what' for mains and our friend lost a bet for dessert. Had a good laugh post dinner by the bar for the 'a-ha' moment when shown the dishes.Yes, as you can tell, the bar had a good spread of cocktails and an engaging bar tender.Curious yet
5
Felt welcome and the hospitality that the staffs gave was excellent. The food taste fantastic and the experience is extraordinary. Highly recommend everyone to try this restaurant once in your lifetime, no regret. Will come back again :
5
Does not need many words. Food was great, service brilliant and the whole experience one I will never, ever forget. Well worth the time and money
5
Great service, fun company, good food, lovely service. While a bit pricey but worth every penny for the experience. Will b back for sure
4
We had a fun, special and most memorable food experience at Nox. Warm and kind welcome and great service all through the evening. I truly didn't imagine it could be that pitch black all through the dinner. Food was delicious and flavors varied and exciting. The one thing that could improve was that the time between the courses was too short. We started feeling full too early on which is a pity
5
Time really flies when you dine in the dark!A truly unique experience, especially when the tastiest tofu that I've ever had in my life, turns out to be foie gras.I thoroughly enjoyed the 3-course meal that was served in bite-size pieces. The mock tail pairing was equally an equally exciting guessing game. The experience does make you appreciate your senses better. It was a relaxing experience as you tend to let your guard down in the dark. We could just be ourselves, being vulnerable and attentive in the dark. The air-conditioning is a little cold though. It is encouraging to know that Nox practices inclusive employment, all of their waiter/waitresses are visually-impaired individuals. Our waiter Zee was rather friendly and attentive throughout the 2-hour dining.I came with zero expectations and now Nox has definitely set the bars high for any other dine-in-the-dark experiences! Not recommended for first dates especially if you can't stand awkward silences
5
It was truly an experience for us. From the time we stepped into the dimly lit lounge on level 1 till we moved up to the pitched dark dining area on the 2nd Level.The service was fantastic especially our host, Liew. His assuring voice was something we look forward to in the dark and he ensured that we were comfortable while in total darkness. Our sense of taste was elevated to a higher level since we need to figure out what we were eating. We definitely recommend this experience!
5
Delicious food, commanding your full attention! We didn't do well at guessing what we tasted. An interesting feature of eating blind is that you spoon piece by piece, missing in those bites the combined flavors the chef intended. Highly recommended
5
Came here not knowing what will happen. We ordered drinks in the lounge and were given a detailed run through of what's gonna happen.It was a complete darkness and there are a total of 12 dishes. 4 appetizers, 4 mains and 4 desserts. They are all placed in small bowls.Our usher is Hafiz (if I did not get the name wrong) is very professional and assured us especially when we have an elderly amongst our group and slowly guided us to our table. After the dinner, around 1.5 hours later, thou it kinda feels like 30 mins to us, we were back in the lounge and was shown what are the food that we had earlier on.It was a mixture of seafood, cod fish, prawns, foie Gras, pork, chicken and duck.Overall we paid for around $100 per pax and had a wonderful time in this place. Thumbs up for the service too :
5
We had the privilege of dining at Nox on World Sight Day. This was our second visit to Nox and if it was possible we enjoyed it more than our first time. The food is amazing and the experience is second to none. It is a great thing to step outside your comfort zone and experience an incredible meal without using your sight.
4
The first of a kind. You would dine here for the experience. The meals are very tasty but i feel the price is a bit on the high side for the overall experience. If your interested in the pitch black experience then i would recommend
4
This experience is really worth. The meals are prepared by a chef and the ingredients are really of top quality. Having to eat in the dark brings your appreciation of food to a whole new level. Two thumbs up
5
Nice and great experience. Not to mention the food, it was all delicious and the staff was just great. We could not ask for more.

The 3 course vegetarian meal was amazing! The mushrooms and cauliflower were to die for! The desserts were heavenly. We were celebrating a birthday and the entire experience was amazing. Very kind and friendly server who chatted with us towards the end of our meal about her journey which was quite interesting. We spent almost 1.5 hours in the dark and our other senses were definitely heightened and we really loved the food and had a very enjoyable evening! The wine pairing was also wonderful...we had some great wine

This was our last dinner before returning to Europe. We consider ourselves very experienced eaters, so we wanted to leave something for the last night we believed was going to be special and unforgetable. On arrival we were seated in the lounge area and were offered the drink list to choose from. Also the host has explained what was going to happen during our dinner. In about 30 minutes we were introduced to our waiter and were escorted upstairs to the completely dark dining room. Tasting menu of 4 different courses, were all served within an hour! Each plate consisted 4 different dishes all were served in a hurry. The food itself was mediocre at it`s best. No character, no deep flavours, no inviting smells. When you are dining in the dark you are more relying on your other senses then your eyes. There was no time in between plates to even try to identify the courses everything came so fast. In 55 minutes we were downstairs again, where the host was trying to show us and explained us what each course was. Or was suppose to be. All in all we left really disappointed, this place was not any culinary experience for us. For what is has offered was way overpriced as well

The staff inside the dark was GREAT but the service after the dinner at the bar was horrible, they just wanted to send us away! They even show properly the dishes. I ask to see the bottles of the wines we'd drink there and they just show quickly and give us the bill. I think it was a one time experience

We visited Nox while in Singapore for the Grand Prix this year, after reading the reviews we were intrigued to experience dining in this fashion.Dining in the dark was certainly a strange feeling. The food was amazing and we were surprised that we were unable to identify some foods. The staff were very welcoming and knowledgeable which added to the great experience

Eating in complete darkness, an amazing experience. Guided by our blind host up the stairs to the restaurant in complete darkness without a moments hesitancy ... fantastic . Eating our three courses accompanied by two glasses of wine, awakens all your senses. The food was tasty, each course served in four separate bowls, each course had a stand out, yum Yum. The only criticism, we felt a little rushed, a little more time in between courses would allow time to explore and enjoy the entire experience more
5
Don't be fooled by the darkness.... the quality of the food speaks for itself regardless of the light. This is the second time I have eaten here as I travel to Singapore and once again it did not disappoint. It is a very humbling experience given we live in such a fast world. To take time to re-engage your other senses of touch, smell and taste... never mind listening. With no phones or activity around you to distract you, you become more present in the moment .... in the conversation... with the people you chose to be there with. It's a great thing to do as a group or a couple. You clearly understand the importance of communication as you try to walk up the stairs and you are 5th in line in your group... and they are so busy trying to look after themselves they fail to tell you what's coming. ....i.e. another step. Excuse the Pun.. but this is an EYE OPENING experience.Amazing talented vision impaired waiters and tantalizing Cocktails!!!!!must visit

We visited here whilst on honeymoon, we love food and thought this experience would be different, it certainly was. The staff are very friendly and passionate about the concept of the restaurant we couldn't stop talking about it after we left.The food was great and some of the dishes that we were convinced we'd got right we were wrong! If your looking to do something unique and love food I would definitely recommend this restaurant.

It was a fantastic family experience. Our kids dind not know what to expect and got really excited and unseasy. We met our visually imparied waiter who happen to be sooo nice. Upstaris the adventure began. First you get to dine without cell phones around, which is already wothy! give it a try! food looks better on the ipad later, cause we are actually used to "eat with the eyes" first

My hubby mentioned Nov dining in the dark briefly and I decided to take him there as a belated birthday treat. We were greeted by very friendly staff (who pleasantly turned out to be my ex student!) and then taken upstairs in a blind leading the blind way(putting your hands on the shoulders on the person in front of you). Once upstairs, it was pitch black and the only light you can see is the red lights from the security cameras above. Food was nice but because it was so dark, I felt uncomfortable with my eyes open. Closing them made me feel better. Since there was nothing else to do after the food, no ambience or decor to comment on, we left after that. It was good to know from the pictures what we actually ate and it was a good move to ask us to fill up a form about the food so we spent some time actually trying to remember the ingredients and what we ate. Pricing was like fine dining, at least $100++ per pax. Overall for a first time, it was interesting but probably won't go again for some time
5
Nox was such an interesting experience! I came here with my partner for our date night and we were served by an extremely talented and capable crew. Even though we were nervous about dining in the dark, the crew made it an enjoyable experience. Logistically, it would be challenging to dine without being able to see where the cutleries were. However, the server explained the layout of the table and the food tray extremely clearly. We are happy to say that there were no dining accidents! :DThe dining experience was a unique one. Unlike a traditional fine dining experience where each dish presents itself as a piece of art, NOX strips away the visual element and allowing us to fully focus on the taste of each dish. After awhile, it gets pretty confusing - I got lost on the type of dishes I've consumed and I struggled to match the flavours to the images post-dinner. Nonetheless, it was an interesting experience!Be sure to tell the team if you have any allergies beforehand
5
Our staff Hafiz was really friendly and approachable. The food was great and of excellent quality. Price was worth it for the dishes we had (from foie gras to scallop to caviar). Perfect experience for friends and couple, you really have to communicate with each other and time spent was worth it as no phones were allowed and you just had to genuine conversations! Haha. Definitely will go again as they changes menu every couple of months too! We learnt that our sense of sight is actually very important to us and kudos to the people working there! They earned our respect!
5
My Husband and I had a great night at NOX. The food was all delicious and the staff very friendly. It was quite a new experience to eat without seeing (the room is completely dark...cannot even see your hand in front of your face!) so we had a fun time trying to use our taste, smell and touch to work out what we were eating
5
Extremely glad that I made this choice of going to NOX for my anniversary with my lady. The whole experience was like a roller coaster ride to me, made us so hyped up before the dinner with the welcome drink and pre-dinner appetizers but kept us in suspense as we do not know what to expect in terms of both the environment and food. Similar to roller coast, every twist and turn we subsequently took was filled with fun and laughter. We enjoyed every single moment from being led into the world of darkness, trying to have a toast in the dark and to eating and trying to figure out the dishes. Chatted non-stop throughout the dinner. maybe partly we just wanted to make sure that our other half is still there, haha. I really felt like we were in our own world then, enjoying ourselves and savouring the food. Time flies, it feels short but we spent close to 3hrs for just the dinner itself. Apart from the unique experience, NOX is able to provide. Fundamentally, the food it serves is top-notch. My partner and I did not even spare a single drop of sauce, we literally emptied the bowls. Some of the dishes served are the best we were tasted.Services provided was excellent. My partner and I love the post meal activity of which we were to guess the dishes we had. It's also a great way to recap the experience while it's fresh in our memories. In summary, my partner and I had a non-stop excitement from the every moment we step into the restaurant till even after we stepped out as we were still discussing on the dishes we had. Highly recommend this unique dining experience for anyone who hasn't tried this before

Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and I'm glad this turned out to be highlight!! He was really pleasantly surprised and delighted with this whole experience! It was a first for both of us. The receptionist, the waiter (Hafiz) and the food were all fantastic! I must admit I had a slight panic attack when I first embarked into the absolute darkness and felt like I was fainting. But after a min or so, after I get accustomed to the pitch black environment, I felt a lot calmer. Hafiz, our waiter, was very kind to keep checking with me if I was okay.The entire experience was great! One thing was because we were really "present". No phones, no distractions, and all we had was each other's voices for company. And we were discussing throughout what we were eating. What a test of our taste buds! The wine pairing was great as well! Food was only served after checking that we have finished the previous course. Although it's on the pricey side, I felt that it's worth it because the food was simply yummy! After the meal, which took about 45min, we were given a short questionnaire to write down what we think we ate. And thereafter, the staff will show us photos of the food that was being served.Overall, I would highly recommend this place for anyone who hasn't tried this before. Awesome and interesting experience! ((: It also gave us some insight to how it would feel to be visually impaired. One thing to improve on was their response rate. Cos I called them and emailed them few weeks back to reserve. Since no one answered, so I emailed to just check how long will the dinner be, just so I can plan for the night. But there was no response. And they called me 2hrs beforehand to confirm my reservation (but I was watching a movie and can't pick up). So I thought that emailing me or SMS-Ing for confirmation a day before might be a better idea. But small issue here! Many thumbs up!!

We came to Singapore to celebrate our anniversary. I always like to surprise my wife, & not let her know where I make a dinner reservation. So she had no idea at all prior, to where we were heading right up to getting to the sign on the front door.Our reservation that I made online from Melbourne about a month prior was confirmed with a return email, then with a txt message earlier in the day. On arrival we were escorted to the lounge area were we were tempted to try some of the many cocktails on offer. So try many we did! Then we were briefed on what were were to expect, prior to being introduced to our servers & escorted you our tables in the pitch dark dining area. This took some getting used too. However, we soon became relaxed. When the food started arriving. Using only your hands to feel around the table for your utensils, plates & drinks was a challenge, however all part of the fun. The food was outstanding. Off course the conversation was all about trying to recognise what had been served. With all your senses except sight put into overdrive. At the end of the dinner service. We were taken back into the main lounge where we asked to fill out a short questionnaire on what we thought we were served. After a few minutes. Our host explained & showed us pictures our each of the 12 different dishes we were served. I think I only guessed 2-3 correctly. Interestingly, I really enjoyed every dish served. However, I would not have chosen some of these if I was asked to select from a traditional menu. All in all a wonderful experience. Thank you to all at Nox

The title says it all. We don't get to dine in the dark ever... until you come to Nox! An awesome experience where all other senses got heightened and display their specialty to the fullest:) went to celebrate birthdae but there was no complimentary cake like what I've read on previous reviews. Food is great but maybe on a high side. Service is excellent. But I do feel a bit rushed when eating.
5
This was a wonderful dinner experience to celebrate my husband's 50th birthday. Both of our teenagers enjoyed the whole process, and it will definitely be an unforgettable time for the birthday guy.I made the reservation on line from Canada one month in advanced. They had all the details I'd mentioned: allergy alert, extra chocolate cake, a minor.The ambience at the main lounge is smooth and welcoming, the host is great at explaining the process. The servers are fabulous, and we enjoyed the excitement of trying to guess what we were eating, to not spill our drinks, and to savour the delicious food. Chefs are the best!At the end, the hosts were great at showing us what we had for dinner, adn helped us celebrate my husband's milestone. We will go back again when in Singapore

A very unique experience for my friends. Learning to eat and enjoy every bite in the dark- guessing the dish from the flavours and texture. Feeling around for the cutlery and glass. Every dish has its unique burst of taste. Even items like foie gras I didn't think I like was savoured with much delight. Wait staff were really helpfu
5
The food was of good quality and tasted delicious. Expect to eat small portions and enjoy guessing what you're having. Staff were professional and very attentive. Pricier side, but you're paying for a unique experience, so in all felt worth it.
5
To all those who are looking for a different dining experience or a place to test their 5 senses (less their sense of sight), NOX is definitely a place where they do not want to miss!
5
When you read dine in the dark, you think you will still be able to see a little.That is not the case - it is literally pitch black while you are eating, and what an experience it makes!The staff were very friendly and funny, the food was delicious, and surprising.If you are after a unique dining experience, this one is for you
4
This is absolutely a fantastic experience. You'll either love it or hate it, but you have to try it! I don't know who came up with this idea, but it's an ingenious one. I went to NOX with my husband and my Mom and even though I myself would never do it again both my husband and my mother LOVED it.Once you get to NOX they serve you cocktails and some hors d'oeuvres that are absolutely phenomenal. Then it's time for you to put your wallet/purse and electronics away and go upstairs for dinner - entering the pitch black dining room. I must say i almost didn't stay. I'm a little claustrophobic and the whole experience gave me a lot of anxiety. So I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is either claustrophobic or suffers from severe anxiety. I had a really hard time. On the other hand, my Mom and my husband had THE BEST TIME. We took turns trying to guess what we were eating and trying not to spill the food, which was kind of fun. It's amazing how much we rely on our vision.After dinner the staff shows you pictures of what you had to eat and you can laugh at your guesses - and almost cry because you spit out the wagyu beef. As others have said: this is a MUST!!!!

I had such high hopes for this experience since it was for my husband's birthday. I really felt so disappointed. I can't stress this enough.While the service was amazing (thank you, Zee - you are a star!) and the concept fascinating, the food was average. At $300 for two with a wine pairing, we were so shocked we literally had to laugh! We have been to several establishments around the world that work specifically to employ people with disabilities (including here in Singapore). The food quality at all were better than here for a fraction of the price. I understand the concept and the social responsibility aspect (and appreciate that very much) but it's not an excuse to charge outrageous prices. If the food was up to snuff I wouldn't care about the cost! I'm not even a picky eater which is the funniest part. We never complain about food but barely touched this. We actually went to a different restaurant afterwards because we were still hungry!Also the birthday cake I ordered for my husband came late and without his name on it (which I was specifically told would be on it when I spoke to the lady on the phone). It was clearly an afterthought. For a $20 piece of cake that's just wrong.And finally, the music in the waiting area is too loud! And playing Backstreet Boys on blast? Surely that's a joke!Come on guys! This is Singapore! Standards here are some of the highest in the world. For those of us who live here, there are far better food options for less. Unfortunately I cannot recommend. I would have said as much to your staff but I decided not to make a fuss on my husband's special day

My girlfriend surprised me with a meal in Singapore for my birthday and this was the ultimate surprise. On arrival I realised what the place was and what we would be doing. We were informed that the staff waiting the tables in the dark actually were all visually impaired. We were introduced to our waitress (Urna) who was excellent in the bar which was lit and she led us up the stairs in the dark to our seats in the dark. The darkness was impenetrable, you couldn't see anything and were expected to rely upon other senses such as sound, touch and taste to enjoy the experience. The meal came as three courses, starter, main and desert all of which were separated into 1/4s. So all in all we had 12 mini tasters. It was really good trying to work out what it was you were eating. The food itself was excellent there were a couple of dishes I didn't like however that's part of the fun I say. After we had finished our meal Urna escorted us back down stairs where somebody would talk us through what we had eaten. I must say now, Urna our waitress was fantastic. Natasha (not visually impaired) went through our meal with us, asked us what we thought the food was and the told us. She was also excellent and we ended up chatting away to her for ages after our meal as my girlfriend and her had similar interests. All in all experience was one I would not forget and if you have not experienced a Dine in The Dark it's something you should try. Food great, service excellent 10/10
5
I have a slight phobia of darkness but I enjoyed my experience here at Nox. Hafiz was an excellent host / waiter and had an assuring voice. He seated us and got the dinner started with our appetisers. There was 3 courses and each one had 4 dishes. I enjoyed most of the dishes especially the foie gras! Every dish had an interesting combination of flavours and this kept you guessing what was in there. The dinner made you focus on your partner and the conversation. There was no distraction. It was a wonderful experience.
5
We went on a Monday night. First, the cocktails were really well made with good quality ingredients.The dinning experience was also amazing and besides having the food itself, was really fun having a look on what we have eaten!
4
We had a very fun dinner at Nox with my wife the other day. For those not familiar with the experience, you get to have diner in a pitch black environment, meaning you cannot even see your nose or fingertips and our waiter was a real blind guy.What surprised me most was that the absence of distraction made us more present for each other, focus on the conversation, oblivious to other people around, waiters passing by, no cell phone at hand, nothing. We had a fun time chit-chatting and trying to figure out what we were eating but more importantly, we were 100% into the experience. This is a rare thing those days.The food was excellent, too, at a point we didn't expect and the wine quite decent. My wife and I are real foodies, quite demanding, so it was a nice surprise. Having to discover what was in the plate, type of ingredients and texture made it super fun, too.Only small downsides in my opinion: the 3-course dinner comes in 3 trays containing each 4 little recipients. Meaning you can easily grab each, bring it close to your mouth and avoid the challenge of having to find your food in the plate and make it go all the way to your mouth the way I imagine blind people have to do daily. The experience could be taken a step further by the blind waiter telling you his techniques and letting you experience the real deal.The other small detail is, while the food was good, it didn't make play much with our nose, this also could be explored more. It was a very rich and fun experience anyway, and I really recommend it
5
We arrived Nox with no expectations and left with a really positive experience and a happy stomach. The consept is that you eat three meals in the dark; appetizer, main dish and dessert, but you don't know anything of what you eat. When we got to know that we would not be served food that was alive and especially after the first taste we was very calm. The food was great and eating in the dark was surprisingly easy. The food experience is great due to that nothing else takes focus, the taste and smell is in centre. I recommend to go here for a different and good food experience!
5
What an experience! I don't think I've ever paid so much attention to my food before. Heard about NOX through reviews in the papers and was not disappointed - its along Beach Road and dining is truly in pitch-black darkness.We were warmly welcomed in the lounge and introduced to Zee our waiter, who is blind. He orientated us to our seats and waited on us the whole evening with grace (the best word I can find to describe his service!). Despite being unable to see, it was a most eye-opening experience for me. I was compelled to savour each bite and to taste each individual ingredient - smells, flavours and textures - and how they came together to form the experience going on in my mouth.Definitely makes you "look" at food in a whole different way and be attentive to the individual parts and how they all come together. That alone is worth the experience
5
How could I detail for you bout delicious food!
Absolutely, the staffer will be known what you want and bring to you! I will be coming back again! Amazing!
5
Booked this place for my partner's birthday celebration with few friends as we wanted to try something different. Didn't know what to expect at first, which made the whole experience very interesting.We were guided by people with visual impairment up the stairs to our table in complete darkness, and guide us through courses. Without the sense of sight, we put all our focus on taste and smell, I appreciate every single bite of the food. You will get a full menu at the end of your dining experience, that's when you go 'arh, it's that! i knew it!' Highly recommended
5
I was bought a gift voucher for Nox and so went without knowing much about what to expect. It surpassed all expectations in the best possible way! It is a real experience from the moment you step through the door. The staff (both in the light and dark areas) are warm, friendly and attentive. They seemed keen to look after each group of diners as individually as possible and made just the right amount of fuss about the various special events diners were celebrating (birthdays, anniversaries etc). Make sure you do say when you arrive if you have a dietary requirement or a food dislike as once you get to the dining room you won't know or be able to see what you are eating (the food was all wonderful incidentally!) We started with welcome cocktails (which were delicious and a very good menu) and then proceeded upstairs to the dining room. It really is completely dark!! We had a great time not only trying to figure out what each dish was that we were eating, but also trying to figure out what the waiters and other diners might look like from their voices - such a new and interesting experience! I was a bit worried I might feel disorientated or stressed by the dark, but the staff take care to explain clearly where everything is so I immediately relaxed and had one of the best dinners I have had in ages. Thank you Nox
3
We are from Singapore so thought we would try and find somewhere out for the ordinary for once. As soon as I found this place I knew my wife and kids would love the concept! Really gives you an idea of what it might feel like to be totally blind or partially sighted. The food itself is not the most important concept, so the food is strictly average - to be expected I guess. Perhaps there were a few too many courses for my liking. Also it would appear the tables were perhaps to close together as the table next to us were very loud which spoilt the atmosphere somewhat. All in all an interesting experience. Perhaps a great place to take a 2nd/3rd date?! but maybe not a 1st date hah
5
This is my second time to Nox, and it's just as wonderful as my first visit. Service by the counter staff and servers are friendly and personal, and the food itself is top-notch (I shan't name any favourite dishes that might serve as a spoiler!). I find it interesting that without the sense of sight, the experience of eating can be taken to a new level, and I appreciate the food itself for what it is, pure taste and smell. I'm also impressed by how the servers guide us to our tables in complete darkness, remember our names and guide us through the three courses. Highly recommended
5
Surprised my boyfriend with a Dine in the Dark experience at NOX on his birthday and it was an amazing first experience for both of us! We were greeted by very helpful and friendly staff and the serving staff were really friendly and professional as well. During the dinner itself, despite not knowing what we were eating, the food was AMAZING and of the freshest quality. The atmosphere was cosy and not intimidating even though we were unable to see in the dark. This dining experience gave us the chance to step out of our comfort zone and try food we have never tried before. It was indeed a memorable birthday celebration for both my boyfriend and I. Would definitely visit again
4
Its a new and unusual experience, never had food at such a place.Having food in total darkness/zero light, was a new experience.Offers wide range of food choice, but there's no Indian foo
5
A good place for bonding. The food is fantastic and you will definitely have fun with your friends or loved ones.
5
It's the sort of restaurant that you go to for a totally new dining experience. It requires an adventurous spirit and a non-fussy eater (but they do accommodate to allergies and preferences) to dining in total darkness. Server, Lui, was very professional and competent in his role to guide us around in darkness. Food was decent, but small portions - but great for a mysterious date! We enjoyed it very much and had fun along the way
5
Brought my girlfriend here to celebrate her birthday. We came in a little early and had some time to settle at the lounge. It was our first time trying this concept and the staff was patient to explain us the dining process.Kudos to Zee for the excellent service. Checking on us once in a while to see if we need anything. Food was good. Upon the revelation of the menu, some combinations really took us by surprise.Overall, it was a memorable experience. My girlfriend lost her handphone earlier that day and this dinner definitely salvaged her birthday celebration
5
Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday. Pretty exciting as you first walk up the flight of stairs to your seat in total darkness. Clear instructions from the waiter on where our dishes and drinks are. Friendly staff. The whole experience allows you to really appreciate your flavours a lot more and focus on your food. At the end of the dinner, you'd realize some unexpected ingredients used in the dishes. Love it! :
4
My boyfriend brought me here for dinner to celebrate my birthday. The whole experience was pretty well thought out and I appreciated having many different small dishes to explore in terms of smell and taste. We had lots of fun guessing each dish and my boyfriend's dietary restrictions were also accommodated for. I felt a little rushed into finishing each course as the waiter would periodically ask if we finished our course. While he wasn't being pushy I would have been more comfortable if we were left to finish the meal at our own pace and then call to have him serve up the new course. Having said that, the waiter we had (Fabian) was very service-oriented and efficient in moving about. Perhaps my only real disappointment in NOX was when I was served a birthday cake downstairs in the reception area after we ended the experience - I later found out that my boyfriend had to pay for the cake! It wasn't a very big deal ($20) and we had a decent slice but most restaurants would serve that up with no extra cost, so I definitely felt like the night would have ended on a sweeter note with a complimentary cake, especially taking into account the cost of the meal. I wouldn't really want to go back but it was definitely an interesting experience to dine in pitch black darkness. Go once if you haven't!
5
The whole experience was surreal. I didn't know it was gonna be pitch dark. So it might sound really cool and fun initially, be prepared to go through the thrill! Whilst some people might find it cool and exciting, some might be scared of the dark and those who have close phobia need to think twice!
5
I went by myself for dinner, and I had a great time. I had the vegetarian menu. Without giving away too many details: each course had four items, which were in small bowls arranged like a compass rose (North/South/East/West). The actual dishes were not unusual, but the preparation, ingredients, and garnishes were. This made it a bit challenging to guess what I was eating at each stage, even if I had some idea! I had the non-alcoholic cocktail pairings - these are oftentimes a toss-up because not all restaurants know how to make good non-alcoholic drinks, but I loved mine here. I was sitting near a family of six, and they were talking pretty loudly, but I didn't mind. The experience of being in the complete dark forced me to focus on my other senses, so having nearby conversation made it more interesting. I would highly recommend going if you can afford it (the total came out to about SGD $130 for a three course meal with three non-alcoholic drinks).Erna was my waitress, and she was attentive and friendly.
5
It's totally new experience for me and I was so excited and so curious at the first time the restaurant host explained to me about how dark it would be. When I arrived to the table, it was totally dark, and amazingly, I enjoyed it, and totally enjoyed the foods. It was mixed tastes and I ate it all.From my dinner experiences there, I also learned how sense of listen and taste were sharper when I couldn't see. And off course I had interesting conversation with my companion during our dinner. I totally recommend Nox Restaurant to my friends and will tell about my dinner experiences. It was really cool experience. Thanks Nox
3
For the price, the food was extremely underwhelming. While the experience was novel, I did not feel that the tastes were enhanced by the environment. I would not recommend for those looking for a revolutionary taste experience
2
How exciting to try something totally different - one would think so anyway. We arrived at the restaurant and indeed the welcome was warm and inviting. I explained I don't eat chicken - noted - not a problem. We chose our 3 course meal to be paired with cocktails - alternatives were 2 glasses of wine or 3. (There were 3 cocktails). SPOILER ALERT ***** There were TOO MANY tastes.******So for the 3 courses, you are given a bowl of FOUR different meals. So basically wishing 2 hours you eat 12 different things. This was just too much for me. Tuna tartare, wagu beef, escargot, cod, duck, lamb and some vegetables, risotto and rice - add in a few more things - and that was basically the starter and main courses. The desert also consisted of four mini meals - again - just too much. I'm so sorry to say this as it's a wonderful idea and a super initiative to employ visually impaired people to wait tables etc - but food wise - it was overkill and I felt unwell leaving. And it was so much money to leave feeling unwell! :-(Another note - we were a couple and were seated beside another two people, one of whom we couldn't help overhear talk through the entire meal duration. Perhaps the tables are a bit too close to each other or perhaps it was bad luck to be placed next to a rather loud spoken person
5
Great experience tonight taking my parents. Lovely service and overall fun experience from the downstairs lounge until the after dinner explanation. My parents had alot of fun and said this will be one of the most memorable experiences they ever had.
1
I made a reservation 10 days in advance for my wife's birthday and I requested vegan dish in my reservation. I received the confirmation email and all looked good. 10 days later they called me 1 hour before the dinner and told me they were unable to prepare a vegan meal. I would have given them 10 million zero stars if it was possible
5
An amazing experience NOX - Dine in the Dark. Great service, great staffs. Waiter helped us to our seat in the darkness, he explained us about everything. Really unforgettable experience!
5
Fun and exciting, waiter and waitress have great service. The 3 course dinner are amazing, good for value
4
I've wanted to try Nox since it opened and I finally got around to it this week. Meal worked out to around $140 per pax and I can't say the experience was really value for money, but it was a fun and unique experience if you don't mind spending a bit more. Dining experience: - Don't expect a chill, quiet fine dining experience. Although the servers were really nice and helpful, the whole atmosphere felt pretty rushed. The food and drinks keep coming and there are no pauses between the courses. But we took it in stride as part of the novelty - didn't detract from the experience at all!- Eating in the dark really lowers one's inhibitions haha. I felt so much more comfortable slurping things, feeling about in my food bowls and even experimenting with chewing with my mouth open LOL. There's also something nice about sharing that space with a significant other and guessing what ingredients went into our food (that was the best part).  - Only negative thing I have to say - there was a huge group of people in what seemed like an adjoining room (it was pitch dark, so I couldn't see lol) that made an incredible amount of noise (drunken laughter, shouting). That was really really annoying and no one told them to shut up. I can imagine that it's hard to control a crowd in the dark, but that ruined the experience. I didn't deduct any stars for this because I understand that it is not the servers' fault, but they should learn how to deal with inconsiderate diners in the future. Food:- The food was pretty good and met my expectations (foie gras was on point, desserts were really good, nice variety of food) - Mocktails were $30 for 3 and they were pretty nice but I kinda felt like they tasted too similar. The first one was sweet and sour, the second one was sweeter (but with what tasted like the same base ingredients)...not really worth the money. Overall, I would definitely recommend Nox - try it at least once. But maybe skip the mocktails

Went to celebrate my wife's birthday and I must say it's what you might call a real blind date. The service staff were very welcoming and helpful, smiles always at the ready. Food was pretty good but if you are not careful you could actually drop some of it and that's not good coz it's not exactly cheap. All in all a wonderful experience

We stopped in Singapore for 1 night and I knew I wanted to do something different! After searing for 'unique' and 'quirky' dining experiences in Singapore, Nox Dine in the Dark caught my attention.It certainly didn't disappoint; being centrally located, easy to find, amazing drinks and a brilliant story behind the wait-staff - being visually impaired - really added weight to the dining in the dark experience. The food was fabulous (we still cannot believe we ate and enjoyed snails!!!). You literally cannot see your hand in front of your face during the course of the entire meal. It was mind blowing how 'useless' you felt and bizarre how some of the foods (like avocado) I didn't even recognise because I couldn't see them.The manager is an ex-pat from Perth - Jose - lovely friendly person along with the rest of his staff! We have been telling everyone from Australia to go to Nox in Singapore, it will be the highlight of your trip

Good for a visit, but the novelty might wear off on repeat visits. The food was decent, but price might be a bit steep for the qualit

I was looking to do something different on a Saturday night out and Nox definitely delivered! The staff were friendly, the cocktails were perfect and the food was great! Definitely recommend for a different yet fun date night

This is great way to see how good is your sense of taste and how good you are at orientating at dark without any light.Must start with saying - we have to wait for a bit and sadly I saw few couples entering before us , even they came much more later than us on our reserved time, but when the waiting was over it was really fun evening.They do offer to take out foods you dont eat (like in my case seafood) and dinner consists of 3 parts. Appetizers, main and deserts. Dont get me wrong - they dont give you plate with food and try to scramble it clean, but they do their own system , which simplicity amazed me and I would never be able to think of that on my own, which makes it so easy to eat in dark and not getting dirty.I would recommend in going there with 4 people group. It is fun for a couple, but 4 lady group next to us had a blast and even we were laughing and joinign in conversation as this dinner is not just siitting and eating, but exchanging experience, trying to guess what you eating and just having a laugh.At the end of dinner, you are going to be shown what you ate and you can compare to what you thought it was.

My husband and I went here for dinner recently and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We opted to have the paired cocktails with our meals and were glad we did. The food was good quality and we enjoyed all our meals, my personal favourites were the pork with crackling and apple and what turned out to be the fois gras, something I would not have ordered normally. The experience makes you appreciate your eyesight and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Be aware though like everything in Singapore it was very expensive. Overall it cost us over $300 Singapore dollars, but you pay for what you get and it was worth it
5
A great evening ironically with friends we have not seen for ages. From the greeting to the moment we left we loved every minute of this experience. I was quite apprehensive before we went and I doubted that I would enjoy it but it was probably one of the most enjoyable meals I have had in Asia. I can't wait to go back
5
Despite not being able to see anything in the dining room, atmosphere was just like any other eateries that we've been to. We heard families and couples talking(we weren't eavesdropping k haha!) and hosts talking among each other.. The food was amazing, I enjoyed every bowls of my appetizer, main and dessert. Rahamat, our host was very helpful throughout our dining experience there. He often checks on us and see if we're okay. He is funny to, always cracking joke, making us laugh. We would definitely come back with our family and friends. Before Rahamat dismissed us into the lighted room, he mentioned something that made us speechless.. "Do not take things for granted okay?" Thank you Rahamat for giving us a great experience in Nox. We will not forget you. See you again soon, God willing (

hi,i previously provided a review of this restaurant and at the time, was unhappy about the care taken to cater for my pregnant wife. I have since been in touch with NOX and this appears to have been an individual staff issue rather than a restaurant issue. they have taken this seriously and I would now be happy taking my wife back to the restaurant. I can't review my previous comment so this is an update. thanks, Wil
5
i was extremely surprised when i first went in, at first, i had some trouble with my family locating cutlery and other things, but we had a great experience. the food they served was of a great variety, they served different types of tastes for eat course, and even had course-specific drinks(which costs extra) that were suited for each course. then at the end, they showed us what we actually ate on a iPad , and i was surprised when they told us the waiters were actually blind!. but the only problem that its quite costly and that they have a dress cod
5
It was such a wonderful experience. The staff was very friendly. We definitely got what we came for. It was a different world for us. Dining in the dark enhances the taste buds I guess because the food was very delicious. Of course kudos to the chief as well.
5
Thank you for the unique sensory experience of dining in the dark. The flavours and texture of the food were amplified when we could only rely only on our sense of taste, touch, and smell. My sons also enjoyed being exposed to dealing with the pitch black situation new and unfamiliar to them, as well as the Easter Egg Hunt in the dark following dinner. Importantly, we gained a deeper appreciation for our sense of sight, how blessed we are to have it, and the visually impaired staff who take pride in serving the diners well at Nox. In this regard, we would like to extend special thanks to Leo who served and help us with all our needs for the evening. Nox is an experience I would highly recommend to others
5
NOX is by far the most unique dining experience that my partner and I has ever been to. At first we were a little nervous about eating in complete darkness but the feelings quickly went away after we were briefed by the most friendliest staff and taken to our tables by our wonderful waitress, Irna. The food was wonderful. It was just so much fun guessing what we were eating throughout the whole night, and when we found out what we ate and what the plates looked like, we were simply blown away.The atmosphere was incredible. Imagine sitting in complete darkness and hearing lots of chatter and movement, clanking, rustling and all sorts of other background noises. But the only thing/person that you end up concentrating on is you and the person/people you are with. It really gave us an opportunity to truly be in the moment and connect with each other whilst eating! We had a wonderful night at NOX and we have been telling everybody we know about it, because simply it's something that you just gotta try and 'see' for yourself. Thank you NOX team

We had a great time with friends, experiencing an alternative to a normal dinner out. We received a warm reception upon arrival and a chance to have several cocktails (no prices!) before we preceded to the dinner which was located upstairs. The management was very accommodating as my wife was in a wheel chair and was very patient and supportive when having to make it up the stairs to dinner. Without giving too much away, there are 4 types of each course - starters, mains and dessert. Each are very unique and if you are a foodie like I am, you will really enjoy the experience of trying to identify and recognise the flavours from textures and tastes. You will realize how much you depend on your sight and also learn to adapt to not having any visual support when doing normal things like drinking and even pouring a glass of water!!The evening was an experience not to be missed, but was shocked to see the bill, (despite the quoted $88++ per person), we ended up paying around $350 per couple, and bottled water at $24 per bottle were nearly extortionate
5
Right from the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was warmly received by the receptionist and waiter. The ambience is romantic as the place is dimly lit and the place is scented with fragrance, perfect for celebrating my anniversary with my love one. We got to experience fine dinning in the full darkest which is something you don't get at any restaurants. The delicacy served was specially chosen by the chef which made it hassle free for us. Aside from the amazing taste of the food, the pitch darkness heightened our sense of taste and make dinning really comfortable as we could be as eased without anyone looking at us. A really amazing dinning experience which I will recommend that you try. Will be sure to dine with them again. Thank you NOX

If you are visiting Singapore (or live there) this restaurant HAS to be on your itinerary. Great food, Attentive and humorous service and a very unique dining experience.Don't try to read up on all the details and don't try to figure out what it's all about beforehand. It's much more fun if you go there and let the whole concept surprise you
4
The staff here are really helpful and the service is great. I came here alone as I was using a gift voucher and it was still a very fun experience alone but coming here with someone else or in a group would give a different experience as you can discuss the meals as you are eating them. Without giving anything away you are literally dining in the total dark. The food here is very good and after your meal you see what you have been eating so its good to compare what you thought your taste buds were thinking vs what you ate. The staff here are very friendly and top notch. As they change the menu every few months would definitely like to come back again..with someone else
5
My partner and I received this as a gift. I was quite hesitant at first but it was so much fun! The staff were great, the food was so unique and it was enjoyable to have different flavours and textures in each dish. Would highly recommend this
5
Our date was perfected by the friendly staff, Debbie. A laughter filled birthday night with her service and passion. Will definitely revisit again for the memorable & sensible experience. Food is undeniably good. Thanks, NOX.Xian Cong & Ginie - Visited on the 7th April 201

Overpriced (at ~300 SGD for 2 people) for the quality of the food (mediocre) wine (the same), service (asked to leave the dark room 3 times and still had to wait around 10 minutes until they took everyone in the room to the exit all at once). You are better off drawing the curtains, switching off the light, and dining at home - cheaper and tastier.They aggressively try to up-sell you to their drinks menu, when giving you the briefing for the dinner, presenting you with three options for wine, cocktail, or mocktail pairing, which are all over 40 SGD per person and consisting of 2-3 half filled glasses of wine, which is too sweet, not offering you just a water option.One other thing to notice: the room is monitored via infrared cameras, so they can see you yet you can't, this was not mentioned at any point and I don't feel comfortable with it
5
I've been to other dining in the dark restaurants elsewhere in the world, but NOX stands out for one major reason-- the food is actually really good. I highly suggest this restaurant for both the food and the experience. The wait staff are all visually impaired, but are absolutely fantastic and attentive
5
My son and myself were there recently to celebrate his 10th bday and i think there couldn't have a better way to celebrate. The place gave us a great sense of privilege and inspiration. Food quality is good, it is a bit pricey but the experience you get is priceless. Concept is outstanding. Leo our server (visually impaired) was friendly, courteous and clearly a hell lot more confident than we were. It was such an amazing feeling. Once we kind of managed being out of comfort zone, We could literally feel our other senses becoming more active. Had we been there on any other day our memory could have faded on this experience. But being there for my son's birthday celebration this experience is well etched in our memory for a lifetime.

i really enjoyed every moment of my night at NOX. my fiance and i are not frequent customers of fine dining as we are quite thrifty. however, i decided to surprise him with this experience though i was unsure myself if i could be functional in the dark. he turned out extremely impressed with NOX.we were about 15mins late for the reservation but the staff at NOX welcomed us warmly still and checked with us if we were caught in the rain. the overall impression of the staff at NOX is warm and humourous. for me, it really took away all the worries that i had of having to survive and eat in pitch darkness. my fiance on the other hand was enjoying the humour.the whole dinner experience was dark. really dark. something that i didnt really like before. but i think it turned out to be really memorable, i have been sharing and promoting it to my family and friends since. i am very glad i didnt spill anything, not even water. my waiter, liew, was very patient with me especially. the food was amazing. i really loved the suspense of eating in the dark. NOX made special effort in creating many layers of taste and textures in their food, and i really sensed the effort they put in creating these art pieces. my fiance that the wine they offered was good too! i had mocktail pairing, it was extremely interesting, i thought i was drinking chilli at one moment and bubblegum at the next.my fiance was all praises for the food at the end of the night and even asked the staff if ala carte menu is available. im glad that even in pitch darkness, NOX serves quality food. fyi they change their menu every 4-6weeks!!! i so want to be back
5
It was really fun trying to guess the food that we are eating, the price might be quite steep but it was definitely a worthwhile experience. The food was very good. The experience changed the way I taste and appreciate food. Definitely recommende
5
what a special and interesting experience, opening up your other senses (primarily taste and smell) to really enjoy the dining experience. food was excellent as well, beyond my expectation. was heartening to know that the restaurant employs visually handicapped individuals as service staff, who were very proficient in leading the diners to their tables, as well as serving the food. a very good experience

I have been at the Nox recently following a recommendation. It is a typical dark restaurant in which you don't really see anything (except the IR cameras). It is definetely a great experience but:The food is ok, some dishes are great; some are average. But beware the portions are rather small. The 3 course set meal comes with 4 small cups each. Personally I find the price tag too high; you basically pay for the dark room. 2 people with wine pairing for 300$ is a hefty price and easily hits Michelin levels for set menus. I also found the service ok but to be honest we felt rushed through the whole dinner. Upstairs after each course they serve the next course. In some occasions our wine glasses were not finished yet. Plus, once you are done with the dessert you are asked to go down. You cannot spend some additional time to relax and feel the darkness. Therefore overall 3 star rating but I would go again to support the handicapped staff which is doing a great job.
5
It was a great dining experience, very interesting indeed. dining in the dark enables you to open up your senses and really taste every single ingredient that you think is present in the dish. It enhances your sense of taste and it is fun trying to guess the ingredient in the dishes with your dining partner. We had a fun evening trying to guess and having a mini competition to see who had guessed most correctly (which i won... haha). great service too
5
Went with my date and we had the best and most private dining experience ever. It was so fun and engaging guessing what we were eating. And each dish was excellent. 12 different things to tantalise your taste buds. Well worth the amount we paid. Everything was perfect. the service, attention to detail, the server, the after dinner experience ( i wont spoil the experience for anyone) but it is really engaging. I'm quite competitive so my date and I were competing to see who got the dishes right. all in all, i would totally come back again if not for the experience then it would be for the food
5
Had a wonderful evening with my family at Nox. Everything, from the friendly staff, special server, tasty food were made all the more memorable by the unique ambience.A bit pricey, but definitely worth experiencing it at least once
5
This is truly a unique dining experience. I have to say that I didn't love every dish but the experience more than made up for that. All of the waiters are legally blind and you will be amazed at how they are able to serve your food/wine/drinks in complete darkness. The service was excellent. Eating in the darkness definitely allows you to focus on the textures and flavors of the dishes. You have no idea what you are eating so each dish is a surprise. After the meal they ask you what you thought you ate and then they show you pictures. We thought we knew but we were way off. I highly recommend

We went along for a date night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. Despite a few jokes from my husband about the irony of spending our anniversary in a restaurant where we cannot see each other we were both looking forward to trying a new experience. We had heard about Nox a few times but this was our first visit. I actually felt a bit nervous as we were waiting in the bar having a pre dinner cocktail, a delicious fruity vodka mix, wondering if I was going to eat something I wouldn't usually try and wouldn't like. After putting our phones and watches away in the lockers we were introduced to our waiter, and he led us up the stairs to the pitch black dining room. All of the waiting staff are blind or visually impaired and they are able to navigate the dark room perfectly and put us totally at ease. We were served 3 courses, starter, main and dessert, and all 3 courses consisted of 4 dishes. It was so interesting trying the food without the usual visual input and trying to discern the different flavours we were eating. We were absolutely certain on some and unsure of others. Out of the 12 dishes we tried I liked 10 of them, the only 2 I was unsure of were desserts, but I am always much more of a savoury fan and often struggle with desserts in restaurants so this is no reflection on the quality of food at Nox, just my personal taste. When we had finished our meal we were led back downstairs and got to chat with a member of staff who showed us photos of the food we had just eaten and talked us through each dish and its ingredients. Safe to say we had got more than a few dishes wrong, including some of the ones we had felt certain about. Really interesting! We were told the menu changes every 4-6 weeks and while we had thought before it would be a restaurant we try once for the novelty factor, we now both agree we would like to go back again
5
The dining experience began with a phone call in the afternoon of the meal to check on allergies as well as a request to be at least 5 minutes earlier than the booking time for a pre-dinner "briefing". We arrived about 15 minutes early and were sat down at the large litted reception cum bar on the ground floor where we chose our drinks and an explanation of how the dining experience would be like. You dine in the upstairs room in complete darkness. You are asked to remove your watches and phones and these are put in a locker downstairs before you proceed for dinner. You really can't see anything. You dine in total darkness. The menu is fixed and changed every 4-6 weeks and is varied and delicious. There are 3 courses and each course has 4 dishes with the dishes arranged in a circle and you are advised to start with the dish at the bottom (6 o'clock). You are pretty much guessing what you are eating and that creates most of the conversation during dinner. I oriented myself by feeling the edge of the table using an empty cup on the right as a marker. You get used to it after a short while. At the end of the meal, you are led downstairs to the litted reception where what you have eaten is revealed. One thing I don't see mentioned is that this restaurant because it employs sight-impaired waiters serves as a social enterprise which we are happy to support. Before, we thought that this would be a one time experience but definitely wouldn't mind coming again.
5
We have set dinner for two together with one glass of Argentina red wine and Forest berries mocktail. Very impressed about the whole experience. The food tasted really good and portion is just nice. It might be a little bit pricey but the ingredients are really premium standard so I would say it worth the price. Service is excellent, everyone is professional

I first stumbled upon the "dining in the dark" concept when I watched the movie About Time, where the two lead characters first meet on a blind date ( quite literally ) in a London based restaurant featuring the same dining model as the Nox. I was both intrigued and amazed by the idea of such an innovative and different dining experience. You can therefore imagine my excitement when I discovered that we had the same novelty available here in Singapore. I must admit that I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The idea of maneuvering, let alone eating in total darkness was daunting, to say the least. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were first directed to a lounge area, where we selected drinks to accompany our meal and were treated to a delicious amuse bouche. We were then asked about any food preferences and allergies. I was impressed to learn that every 4-6 weeks, the restaurant designs a range of different menus, each of which caters to specific taste preferences and dietary requirements. This includes a vegetarian menu, a seafood menu, a dairy free menu and many more. I opted for the seafood menu while my far more adventurous friend chose to try anything and everything that was given to him. A few minutes later, we were introduced to our waiter and guide for the night. One of the most unique aspects of the Nox is its team of servers, all of which are visually impaired in some way, or even fully blind. This idea of the blind serving as our eyes in the dark added an extremely personal touch to the experience, which ultimately proved (ironically enough) to be a thoroughly eye opening and enlightening one. As we made our way up a rather intimidating flight of stairs and to our table, the presence of our waiter Leon, which we felt through his calm and reassuring voice, played a massive part in making us feel safe and well looked after. Throughout the two hours of our meal - which I'm amazed to say felt more like twenty minutes - Leo addressed us each by our names and patiently answered all of our questions. After we'd gotten over the initial shock of being submerged in pitch blackness, my friend and I found ourselves starting to comfortably embrace and adapt to the darkness. Without the usual distraction and excitement of colours, shapes and expressions, our appreciation of one another's voices was heightened, as was the sense of ease and familiarity that a gentle touch or squeeze of the hand provided. Shortly after we'd been seated, the real highlight of the evening begun. Leo told us that each of the three courses would consist of four small dishes. The purpose of this tapas style presentation was to make eating in the dark easier and to expose us to a wider spectrum of tastes. After a series of unsuccessful attempts to eat with my fork, (each of which resulted in an empty fork in my mouth and, I presume, a very sad look on my face) I eventually worked out a mechanism of bringing each bowl close to my lips and using the cutlery to scoop and slide the food into my mouth. Not knowing what was to come next created a sense of unpredictability, which was invariably thrilling and I must admit, a little frustrating at times. On so many occasions, I encountered smells, textures and flavours that were undoubtedly familiar but seemed impossible to put my finger on.It was an interesting revelation of how we presume we know certain tastes like the back of our hand, when in reality we hardly ever exercise the maximum potential of our sense of smell and taste buds. That said, there were a few tastes that were unmistakable. Being able to instantly identify these tastes afforded a great sense of satisfaction, and made me realise how evocative specific flavours can be in their ability to bring back memories and effortlessly transport you back in time. After our meal, which went by far too quickly - and was complemented by lovely, lighthearted conversation with strangers in the dark - we headed black into the light for the grand revelation of what each of the delicious twelve plates really consisted of (and, of course, the exciting, much anticipated revelation of what our newfound friends looked like!). A humorous and energetic lady named Debbie walked us through each dish by showing us pictures on an ipad. After scrolling through an array of beautifully and artfully presented dishes, we were stunned and amazed by what some of the tastes actually turned out to be, particularly some of the ones we were so sure we had successfully determined. I'd love to share more details of this, but for the sake of affording you the same element of surprise that I was so delighted by, I won't name any specific tastes.This finishing touch of walking us through each component of every dish, and contrasting our predictions with what we'd actually had, was really good fun - a perfect way to round up a magical evening. It also allowed us to fully appreciate the effort and intricacy that had gone into preparing beautiful dishes, even in the dark. Needless to say, what the Nox offers is an innovative, ingenious experience that will not only delight you with a series of scrumptious surprises, but also challenge many of the perceptions and ideas that you take for granted. At the end of the night, I walked away with a satisfied stomach, a greater understanding of what certain smells, tastes and textures mean to me on a personal level, and a far greater degree of empathy and admiration for those who- quite literally - see the world differently than I do.I promise that if you find the courage to try this special experience, you will definitely be afforded the same gifts too

What a wild experience! First, you sit in the lounge area where you receive an amuse-bouche (the last course you get to see) and can order cocktails. Then, you are taken up into the dining room, where you are served the courses. The waiters are absolutely amazing, having the ability to serve the food and later clean up the table flawlessly. The food itself is fantastic, and the senses are definitely heightened as a result of not being able to see. Definitely recommend this experience!
4
Had a really good experience and we also enjoyed the food. Our fave were the dessert! But it's quite pricey so for sure cannot go often. But highly recommended to at least try once
5
Our experience at NOX was so exceptional that it cannot be compared to any other dining experience. I had a memorable time conversing and eating with my family. The food was made to highest standards. Each course consists of four miniature dishes, so look forward to being blown by the subtle flavours of these impeccably made dishes. The staff were very welcoming and assuring, which is important because the first few minutes of being in absolute darkness can be disorienting. I liked that they were patient as they guided us through the experience. I would highly recommend everyone to eat here because it is a once-in-a-lifetime experience
5
Celebrated my anniversary with my girlfriend here. The concept is quite novel and the service provided by the staff are superb. Firstly, we were greeted warmly by the lobby service staff. They were very polite and helpful ! to ensure a full experience, I would recommend to get a drink ( especially still/sparking water) as they come in a bottle. You had to help your partner to fill her cup in the dark! The staff at the second floor is really helpful as they guided us to our seats. Food is also of freshest quality despite not knowing what exactly we are consuming, it was fun when my girlfriend and I attempt to guess what exactly it was. I would definitely recommend it to others! Do note to make a reservation before heading down(it is hassle-free) so as to avoid disappointment as it seems quite crowded during weekends
4
We went to Nox as a family and enjoyed the food and experience. My daughter also dined in the dark in a restaurant in Zurich and she said the food was much better at NOX
5
My friends and I had a really good time, the food was YUMZ, the waiters were very friendly and kind. It was worthwhile for the experience
5
I went here in a group of 10 friends, it was absolutely brilliant, one of the best things I've done in Singapore. The waiter was incredibly, the food divine and we had such a lot of fun and laughed so much.
4
The waiters (both upstairs and downstairs) are very polite and cheerful. The food was amazing and they used a variety of ingredients including wagyu beef, cod fish, ox' tongue. It wasn't that terrifying and makes us really appreciate our food better
4
It's a one in a lifetime experience!The food taste extremely good when we are not distracted with our sight! Haha :) It's a good experience to dine In the dark and trusting the person infront of you that he's gonna lead u to the table.. lol! Awesome!
3
This really challenges the senses and the food was fantastic. Unfortunately our waiter who was very efficient really lacked personality and warmth taking the fun out of it. Also we ordered wine matching with three glasses of wine but only two were served but still charged for three until I pointed it out. I would probably not go again
4
The food is surprisingly not bad, although not great. They use some expensive ingredients (in lilliputian portions, though) - wagyu beef, abalone, foie gras, etc - but the fact you don't see the dishes and must be careful not to drop the food does take away some pleasure from the eating. The visually-impaired serving staff are delightful, the cocktails staff downstairs quite disorganised. The table next to us withdrew (one person had diarrhea BEFORE the dinner, another person had a panic attack), but they got a full refund. Apparently, this happens about twenty times a week, never with children, though, as they are fearless and more trusting. A good experience in developing empathy with the visually-impaired, but in that regard, Dialogue in the Dark at Ngee Ann Polytechnic is MUCH better because of higher and two-way interaction with the guides
5
I've been to NOX - Dine In The Dark many times. It's really the perfect place to bring your friends or visitors for a fun and meaningful dining experience. Dine in the dark is a unique experience and gives you a glimpse on how it is for a visually impaired person. After such experience you'll definitely start to appreciate that you actually can see! The NOX staff - and especially the visually impaired waiters - are very friendly and professional. Overall, the restaurant holds a very high standard and the quality of the food they serve is great. It's just sometimes some dishes in the fixed menu that haven't been to my liking.As the menu changes on a regular basis, it's definitely a place I'll keep coming back to, whenever I have visitors or friends who yet haven't been.
5
Incredible experience won't describe that but it's all there on their website. The food was great and comes in three courses each course has four dishes served in separate bowls in a wooden platter so 12 dishes in all. They cater to all dietary requirements and most of the dishes were very good. There's of course no way to comment on the presentation . Special shout out for the staff there. Super efficient courteous and attentive. A little pricey but worth the overall experience. We did. It try the drinks but they do have an interesting cocktail menu all priced at 20 per drin
1
3 course meal served in 4 small bowls each time.Mains were small portions of wagyu beef, duck confit, roast pork belly and cod fish.Taste was terrible despite eating in the dark.If they had the lights on, we would have sent every dish back to the kitchen.Wine pairing could have been better but mocktails were disgusting.Visually handicapped waiter was very attentive and kept us fully informed of what he was doing for us. Service at the lounge was dismal. The doorman who might be a supervisor and his assistant had a condescending attitude.
5
I love the whole experience of dining without sight! It was really interesting to try and guess what I was tasting. The food was excellent!
5
We had an extremely amazing experience by Shaun and his team tonight! Everything on the menu was impressively eye opening *even though you cant open your eyes* Thank you so much for this experience! Will definitely recommend our family and friends to this restaurant!
5
Really enjoyed the evening here with a friend. Lovely service from welcome to departure - and the food was totally amazing. The team dealt well with dietary requirements, even last minute ones. Will be going back here again
5
The service - very very smooth, much easier than I would have expected out of dining in the darkThe food - There were 3 courses, each with 4 different dishes. These were surprisingly really good! The experience - Really interesting. I highly recommend this for couples, but not so much for big groups
2
I want to start by saying the staff here really made the place, they were polite and friendly. Z, our blind server was lovely and so clever we loved his service. I had the vegetarian option and my boyfriend had the meat option, we were both really really underwhelmed with our food. All our dishes were cold, not one thing that came out was hot. Not sure if this was intentional or not. My boyfriend was served Fois Gras which obviously I was disgraced about but also so was he. I think when you serve something like that it should be something you pick. Even if when you come in the resturant if there's a tick list of things you'd rather not eat that would make it better. I know the server asks you before hand of any allergies or requirements but that would never really cross your mind. To serve something so cruel I think is really horrendous. Out of all 12 dishes I ate maybe 5 and my boyfriend ate 7. It's a very acquired taste. We did this experience in London and it's so much better there.The best thing about this place was the staff and we left really disappointed as we spent 300dollas for food we didn't like.

Great service, great experience. One of the funny moments was when our host noticed that a fellow diner was a messy eater. This was indeed a fact when we go dining but it was incredible to have someone notice it in the dark! A worthwhile experience - highly recommende

Staff are friendly and service is good. Menu can be customized to suit your dietary requirements e.g. vegetarian etc. After eating we were shown pictures of the food we consume and some of which are pretty unexpected. Will be good if we can keep pictures of the food we ate as a memento unfortunately this was not allowed. The dining area was definitely pitch dark but we managed to enjoy the dinner with our other senses. The servers were also very friendly. Good to have tried this experience at least once.

I brought my best friend here to celebrate her birthday. NOX is a restaurant where guests dine in complete darkness, served by visually impaired waiters. This dining in the dark experience intensifies taste, smell, and touch. Our valuables were placed inside a locker and we were led by our host up the stairs into the pitch dark room. I was extremely nervous and couldn't help laughing. We sat down and were brief on the position of our cutlery and to consume our food clockwise direction. The food was extremely delicious and service was impeccable. We had fun guessing our food and pouring water for ourselves. No hand phones were allowed, it is a good time to have a good talk and concentrate on each other. No distractions from social media or anything. These days we are all handicapped without our phones and lose focus on the people around us. The starters, main dishes and desserts were yummy and the cocktails pairing went well. We struggled initially to get our cutlery and realized how fortunate we are to be able to see. I thought that the servers wore some special glasses that enable to see in the dark as they could clear our plates effortlessly. But no, they were visually impaired. Once we are done, our host led us out to the light slowly. We were shown pictures of what we ate earlier and some of the dishes we got it right and some we were surprised! The presentation of the food was beautiful, like a Michelin chef's work. As it was my friend's birthday, I ordered a slice of cake for her and again it was yummy! Just as we are about to leave we went to the washroom and it was fragrant, lemongrass scent that is very refreshing.We were extremely impressed and had a memorable experience
5
This was my second "Dining in the dark" venue, previous one was in K.L.The whole experience was well done, staff brilliant, my partner was totally amazed, his first time, he ate everything, the food was certainly gourmet, I am a little less adventurous, so I left a few things that seemed to foreign to me. I liked the fact that we poured our own water, the last restaurant that was done for us
5
When we booked to visit Nox both my wife and I had our own preconceived ideas. We were blown away. My wife found it disconcerting at first but then loved it. I was slightly skeptical but heading up the stairs I realised how dependent on our helper we were. Total blackness! Having to be told were your food is! Not seeing your meal! All these things are alien, but the norm to the helper. The food was delicious and provoked much discussion at table. The discussion in the lounge afterwards was so revealing! This is a don't miss for the adventurous!

We ate at Nox on a Friday night, a special occasion to celebrate six months of marriage. I'm disappointed to say it was one of the less enjoyable dining experiences I've had in Singapore. I've done "dining in the dark" before, so my review isn't based on me being uncomfortable or trying something new - it's based on the poor service we received at the restaurant. When we arrived, we were greeted OK and taken to some seats and handed menus. We had to ask them to come back to take our drinks order, then remind them to bring us our drinks. Shortly after, we were escorted to our table. As you know, it's pitch black, but you could tell the room was crowded, and it was loud!! Our waiter oriented us with where our napkin, cutlery and water glass were, then given the first dish. We were not given any instruction or explanation on how the dishes were organized or how we should eat them (i.e. there are four small dishes, start at the bottom of the dish and work your way clockwise). If you've ever been to one of these, you know this is important, as some dishes are very sweet - in this case, the last one was...but we weren't given this direction at all. But luckily, we had been to another one before so knew the general gist. We worked through the first course, and I must say, the food is tasty. After that, we were given our second glass of wine (which for a 3 course tasting menu, I would say they were measured quite small), in which the waiter used fowl language as he brought out the second glass and explained he had brought us the wrong wine. After we were second course / main course, we realized we had never been offered any water (although explained there were water glasses there). After a few attempts to get someone's attention, we failed, but eventually they came to clear our plates, in which we asked for water and they informed us it was for purchase only - no problem, we will take the still water. About 10 minutes later, they came back and handed my husband the bottle of water, with no help pouring it or explanation on how to pour it. I've never experienced this in any find dining restaurant, or any restaurant for that matter. Usually the waiter will pour us the water, especially when it's paid bottles. Next, we were served the dessert and our third glass of wine. We felt something that was like "blue tack" on the top of my husbands wine glass, only to later realize, it was probably someone's chewing gum...yuck!!! We were served the dessert and enjoyed it. They came to clear the plates and rushed to have us leave, we asked if we could please sit for and finish our wine. A few minutes later, someone else came up to us and said they would escort us out...we told them again we needed a few minutes in which he responded "why, aren't you finished your meal?" and we explained again that we would like to finish our wine. I don't like being rushed out of places, especially when the service was poor all along. We then let them escort us out and the second we reached the door / light, the waiter dashed down the stairs and I almost lost my balance as my eyes could not adjust to the light that quickly. We were asked to sit and wait, fill out a survey and then were explained the foods and paid our bill. With the price we paid for this meal, this is classified as high end fine dining, while I would say the food was good but wouldn't qualify it as that, paired with the poor experience, I would not recommend this place

Visited on 7th Jan for my son's birthday celebration and it was very indeed memorable. In fact, we did not know of this wonderful restaurant if not for my son's Kampong Glam project in school, and he has pestered us to bring him here for months! Our host Rahamat was attentive, patient and friendly. Food was fantastic and the family had a nice time tasting every dish and discussing what it is, like judges on Master Chef! Wine pairing was great. In the end, it was fun seeing which dish we guessed right when we were shown what we actually ate. Highly recommended and a must try. Thanks to the team for your great hospitality
5
What an amazing experience eating in pitch black and the food was excellent as well! Our waiter was sight impaired and helped us to our seat in the darkness - really nice guy explaining all and helping us to locate stuff on table plate etc! Truly an amazing experience and worthy of a visit !
5
This was my first time in a place like this. Definitely different experience, something that you must try at least once. Staff was amazing food as well. Zahir was our guy we learned a lot from him
5
Worth a try if you haven't done anything like that. The dinning experience is so special and memorable, we truly had a lot of fun. The food are quite tasty at the same time. It's quite expensive though for the food, but worth the experience
5
I brought my boyfriend to NOX for his birthday celebration on 3rd Jan 2017. We love the entire experience with NOX. The hosts were extremely friendly and approachable, food was great and the ambience (lobby) is also very cosy and enjoyable.The most interesting part of the dining experience is that we were not told what will be served. During the course of dining, my boyfriend and I had various discussions about the ingredients used for the dishes we tasted. After the meal, we were led back to the lobby and the host showed us a few photos of what we just had and more often than not, we were (pleasantly) surprised with what was served.We really enjoyed the entire experience and will definitely visit again for other menus
5
It's our second time dining at Nox, this time with the out of town in laws. We were well taken care of by Liu and senior staff Rachmat. The cocktails at the lounge - Two faces of Sabo is delicious, as always. I love the red wine, perfect for what was a cold evening then. I've always been a fan of good foie gras so it was so delightful to have had it in our meal - foie gras with caramelised bananas. So delicious. I highly recommend going to this restaurant for the food & the experience. Truly amazing.
4
Overall a very interesting dinner which, with every mouthful of food, makes you go hmmm... what is the familiar taste..... There were sounds of glass breaking as guests probably had difficulty maneuvering in the dark. It was kind of unnerving not knowing how much time you had to finish the food, as you had absolutely no idea when the next dish would be served. As phones are banned (for obvious reasons), this is a good chance to sit down and interact with your dining companions, and guessing exactly what is being served.
5
What an experience to dine in the dark. it gives you a greater appreciation for our friends who are visually challenged. We had Muhamad as our host and he really made us feel at home and humoured with us. Once we asked Muhamed (without thinking) ïs it darker now", to which he said ï dont know i cant see". LOL. Not once did we feel he was visually handicap. In fact I felt I was the handicap one who could not see and had to grope my way around the table. It was fun trying to guess what the dishes were. We had food on our faces, spilled food on our clothes and sometimes used our fingers to feel what they were. At the end of the dinning, we were shown what we had. They are quality stuff eg Wagyu beef, cod fish, foie gras etc .. but then who knows .. we cant see (LOL). The kids enjoyed themselves and so did I. A must do for the experience
5
I was very fun.We could not see anything.But, we could drink, and eat.I talked with my wife "What is this dish?".Final we could know correct answer.We were very excited.Food is delicious, service is good.I can recommend it
4
IT was an amazing Dinner with NOX, Stimulating all your Senses around :) :) Service was excellent though little expensive.. Worth a try for Sure.
5
Love our experience! Though we weren't brief with what's going to happen before entering the dark room, but we are pretty lucky to have a attentive waiter attending to us throughout the entire dinner. He's humourous and patient. He slowly guide us along the way. The experience is great too!
5
It's a great experience for me and my friends who are 1st time there. The food are super, service there are excellent and it makes us treasure our eyes more now.
5
Went for end of year team meal and really enjoyed it - was interesting dealing with navigating around in the dark and food was great - even if we weren't 100% sure what it was! Staff were lovely and was a really nice Christmas night out - thanks Nox

We were there as a couple a few days ago. My boyfriend surprised me with this special dinner. I didn't had any idea what could happen within this evening. If you enter into the restaurant you are directly in the lounge and bar section. First of all the staff welcomes you very warmly and explains you how it will work and what show you partly what would happen later. If you have any allergies or incompatibilities you can tell them before. If you would like to enjoy a drink you can order one in the lounge before or after the dinner. In the lounge are you receive a first appetizer how shows you how the kitchen works. First of all this appetizer was very delicious. After that you have to leave your bag and mobile phones in a locker and take no belongings with you. Staff members advise you to the entrance of the 'real restaurant'. From now on the darkness begins and the blindly staff members take care of you. You enter the restaurant through a stair which brings you upstairs. Every step you go upstair it darkens and at the end of the stair you wont see anything. You have to put your arms on the shoulders of the staff and after that you take a seat at your table. It is a very special atmosphere but honestly it is a crazy moment because you couldn't even see your hand in front of your face. But no worries nothing can go wrong and the staff is very helpful in case you may have any questions. There will be served three courses (appetizer, main course, dessert) served in four little bowls. It is a once in a lifetime experience to taste your meal completely blind. You can choose to pair your dinner with a wine company to each course. We had three different wines which were really fine and very good fitting to the dishes.After dinner you fill out a little paper where you write down what you experienced and you think you have eaten. At the end the secret will be disclosed and you will be very surprised about the gap between your meaning and the reality. The quality of the food is very high standing and we really liked every course. For us it was a unique and funny experience and worth the money. And the end it is very impressive and stunning how blindly people find their way in the completely darkness of the restaurant. We can recommend this restaurant to people who look for a special evening and definitely would come back

Surprised my other half with a treat at NOX. We love the concept because we did not have to crack our brains on what to order as it usually happens all the time.. Both of us are pretty picky yet adventurous with our food so at NOX, not knowing what we were putting into our mouths, we ate food that we would not if given a choice. It's a blessing in disguise because we tried so many things we would normally avoid! So that's the fun of it! You'll be surprised during the reveal of the menu (:NOX is accommodating with dietary requirements as my other half is a vegetarian. The entire meal made me pretty full (I'm a moderate eater) but it may not fill/satisfy the tummies of big eaters! Overall experience is unique and interesting. To top it off, staff, visually impaired or not, are AWESOME (
4
This was one-of-a-kind experience! Imagine eating in the dark not knowing where you are, what food you are eating, where your companion is. Fun yet deceptively difficult.
3
We were fascinated by the idea so we reserved our table and off we went. It is a great concept and certainly gave us an appreciation of the difficulty experienced by blind. So saying, however, the serving staff are visually impaired and how they manage to faultlessly serve us was impressive. It was fun as we tried to work out exactly what we were eating and the flavours coming through. I did think it was a tad overpriced, but it was certainly an experience.One word of warning, if travelling with anyone who may experience sensory issues, this may cause an overload and may diminish the experience for them
2
Lets start with the goods:- Good service- Interesting concept- Accommodating special meal requestsNow for the bad:- Serving gourmet ingredients with poor execution doesn't make your food good- Food was not fresh, particularly the seafood- Food served cold (or lukewarm)- Vegetarian menu was pathetic (half the things were not palatable, with no proper theme)- Dining in the dark would suggest a play on textures but there really wasn't much of that- Desserts were horrendous (except the sorbet)I went with my date (a vegetarian), and there were several dishes we had to pass on cos they were that bad. The entire menu was amateur at best - the kinds that wouldn't even make it past the first few rounds of masterchef. Save your money and go elsewhere cos the bad points will completely overshadow the good. If you really want to experience eating without your sense of sight, go to a recognised joint, blind fold yourself and ask the waiter to surprise you
5
Me and my girlfriend wanted to try Nox dine in the dark after lot of friends suggested us to go there. They are definitely up to our expectation, all the experience was fantastic, from the moment we entered the restaurant downstairs till the end of the dinner. The dinner was fun and our waiter, who I unfortunately forgot the name, was excellent. I would definitely suggest Nox for everyone who wants to try something really new and exiting. All the staff are very friendly and smiling.Thank you everyone!
4
This was definitely something different and worth experiencing.the staff were good and friendly. If I did it again I would like to know what I was going to eat before hand
5
Celebrated a birthday. So the only thing I can tell you about the food was they served a signed birthday cake. The fact is guests shouldnt reveal what they have at this r staurant - spoils the surprise for future guests. But you will not be disappointed. The atmosphere is intriguing and after a while you do get the sense of your surroundings.Highly recommended.
5
This wasn't my first experience in a dark restraunt, but it was my wife's. Such a wonderful experience! Amazing food and very friendly staff. One of the neat things: I'd been to places before where the staff wear night vision devices. Here they are sight impaired. Super cool
5
My Boyfriend and I went here for our 3 year anniversary. It was a thrilling experience! The lounge area where you're first seated is quite comfortable with a bar for drinks and sodas. We were brought a one bite appetizer of salmon in a waffle cone with black seeds. It was a delicious insight into the rest of the meal :)After a short time we were introduced to our waiter and guide for the evening, Neil. He led us up the stairs, around a corner and past a curtain into total darkness. I have to say it's frightening to walk in total darkness in a place you don't know while wearing heels :) Ladies, maybe this date is one to wear :) We were seated and giving a quick orientation of our table. Where the utensils, water glass and water bottle was situated. Each meals was four separate bowls of deliciousness that you ether ate with your fork/spoon or hands. Each bowl was an adventure! We called out to each other the ingredients we identified or the sheer surprise of what we bit into! :DThe dessert was by far our favourite part. Although we were not adventurous enough to order coffee everything was scrumptious!The company from the surrounding tables made the experience so much fun! One girl even guessed where I was from based off of my accent! Both of us would love to go back for our next date :)NOX thank you for the great experience!
5
I have wanted to do this for a long time and so was very pleased when it did not disappoint in any way, the cocktails that Jose made on our arrival were exceptional and the experience you are about to receive is explained to you clearly. All waiters / waitresses are blind or have impaired sight so you are taken for a brief introduction to meet your waiter who leads you in to the dark restaurant our waitress was called was Erna who was great, we chose to go for the wine pairing option for our meal which was excellent. Each course has 4 bowls so 12 in total and I have to admit I had no idea what I was eating for a few of them, smell and touch came in handy though, and some how we spilled no wine ! Once finished you are again taken down to the bar where Jose showed us photo's and explained everything we had ate and we had another cocktail as the first was so good. This truly is a great experience and I would highly recommend to everyone
5
This must be the weirdest dining experience i have ever had.Let me explain.The restaurant is literally a "dine in the dark " experience. When you enter you can sit in reception with a drink and the owner/maitre d will explain how it works.Mobile phones, wathches or anything that could possibly shed any light is locked away in your own locker prior to entering the dining room.All food allergies and dislikes are taken by the Staff.The waitng staff are all blind people who serve you in a totally darkened room with full instruction on how to manage the various courses in front of you.The topic of conversation at the table is invariably about what you think youre eating at various times. Let me say that the food is to die for and very highly rated in Singapore..When the meal is over you are brought back to the very bright reception area and asked to guess each course. Mostly correct we got a few real surprises and were shown computer photos of each course.This is an experience not to be missed 
4
Such a cool experience to eat in the dark! To appreciate the food you are eating, work on your conversational skills without visual ques and utilize your other senses. It's such a different experience, I highly recommend people try this at least once
5
I never imagined that i can eat anything and still say its better than my normal meals i eat everyday.You will be warm welcomed when you reach by the restaurant staff ,and will have to wait in the lobby for a while till you are escorted upstairs to the Dark.An unforgetable memories eventhought the price is expensive . 9/10 will come back soo
4
Love the whole concept. Enjoyed the food and drinks. Tasty and value for money. A must try and you will not regret
5
For my wife's birthday I had made a reservation and didn't t tell her where we would be going.When we arrived she was a bit skeptical as i had told her about the restaurant of my first experience a few years back and she was more like 'hmmmm not for me'.Started withe nice glass of wine downstairs while the staff explained the procedure. I had chosen a vegetarian meal for myself and for my wife the 'normal' menu.After dropping all our belonging into a locker including phones and watches, to avoid any light, we were guided upstairs into the dark.When we reached to top and going through a curtain it was really dark, with our hands on the shoulders of the waiter we were guided to our table and the fun started.Based on my first experience there advised my wife to use fingers and forget the fork and spoon. Meals are served in small bowl and easy to bring to your mouth.With 3 courses and some nice wine we had a really great evening and my wife is already asking when do we go back, she really loved the atmosphere and the food quality.well done NO
5
Awesome food and experience! I definitely will recommend my friends and head for a 2nd or 3rd visit! :D
Service was excellent too!
5
This was the most unique dining experience I have ever had. To be in complete darkness while eating your food and not knowing what is being put in front of you is nothing you have done before. Having to rely on your other sense while eating definitely changes things. Another great thing about this experience is that it keeps you present and engaged with the people you are dining with. There's no checking of phones or being distracted. You will find yourself very connected with the people at your table. The food was very good. There was an option for a cocktail or wine pairing with your meal. We chose a cocktail pairing which I don't recommend. The cocktail pairings we had weren't that good. Which was odd because the cocktailso we had in the lounge were very tasty. The menu changes a few times a year so I would definitely do this again.
5
You cant see a thing while you eat, it is completly dark. It was a new and great experience. I think its the first time me and my girlfriend only talked about the food during the whole meal. The food was good and so was the wine. When you leave the diningroom, they will show what you ate. I would highly recommend to try this restaurant, as it offers a completly new way of dining
5
What a fantastic concept and an awesome place. The food was excellent with a varied tasting menu and the cocktail pairing worked very well. The waiters were very helpful and patient. A surreal experience that I would love to repeat in the future. Will definitely be back once the menu changes.
4
I managed to finished all my food in the bowls, for all courses and to the amazement my food server, Liew. Due to my misspent youth of playing games with my eyes closed. hahaBy the way, most people will not think that I am an active reviewer on this platform by looking at my size or appearance. LOL. Anyway back to the reviewService- Its generally good but they can go up a notch. The service in the "dark" room is excellent. Stuff to improve- When moving up the stairs to head to the room, it will be good if our drinks are brought up instead of carrying the drinks ourselves. We were told to place our hands on the person in front so as to not to lose our way. So holding our bottles in one hand and the other hand holding the person in front, doesn't leave any hand to balance ourselves. Its just a safety issue, waiting to happen. Thought they would had ironed this kink out since they had been operating for so long. Shouldn't had given the drinks below to us.Food- I can keep gushing on the gastronomy experience with the 4 bowls for each course, namely starter, main and dessert. Kudos to the chef!! Wagyu beef, etcTheres one slight beep here too that's why everything is 4 stars, the deep fried pork belly, the skin was so tough that its practically unchewable. Please do remove the skin.Location- Beach road. Inbetween Bugis and Lavender mrt station. Closer to Bugis though.Price - Similar to fine dining. enuff said
5
I took my partner for birthday dinner to NOX - no better choice in town.The service both in the light and in the dark is excellent and very helpful.The experience is well crafted, starting with a nice drink followed by dining in the dark. We additionally ordered one more cocktail after getting out from darkness.Talking about cocktails there is nothing to be improved - first class flavour combinations, you can have a classic one or simply ask bartender to prepare something you feel like having, both options never let me down (yes, drinks are so good I returned multiple times just for cocktail!)Talking about food - of course not much to be said about the presentation but the taste buds will be delighted. Quality ingredients served in nice combinations, some very innovative. Menu changing every 3 months, a room for creativity.Although I already experienced dining in the dark so there will be less surprise when it comes to experience itself I am looking forward to return to NOX for quality food.And do not say no to wine pairing - wine choice enhances the flavours even more and is priced reasonably
4
 Food was really good. When you are limited by your visual sense, all your other senses come alive, and you really learn to enjoy your food!
5
Went there again after 1 year, the place never fail to impress me with the food and experience. Every course is equally tasty and like every bit of the experience.
5
Ive actually dined last year but until now I could still remember how great the experience was. Went there with friends , started with cocktail (great presentation and must try cocktails!) , briefed on whats about to happen, went upstairs. Its totally dark at the dining room. Our server was very professional. We enjoyed our meal, kept on guessing whats the food infront of us.. Memorable dining experience with excellent service.. A must try!
5
I have been to Nox-Dine in the dark restaurant twice and both times i have loved it. The food is amazing and conversations about the food are hysterical. You really do eat in the dark, you can not see your hand in front of you.The staff are all extremely attentive and really prepare you well for the experience. It was so enjoyable that we still talk about the experience months later. It really is something that must be experienced if you come to Singapore
5
Had a romantic dinner with my wife is that amazing restaurant. Staff are all wonderful. I have already recommended to friends who had a similar experience.
4
This was something I've considered doing for a long time but just couldn't get my head around the concept. I love good food and I'm really traditional like that. This is off the beaten track... and .... what a path it is! Firstly, I believe all of the NOX dining experiences are a little different depending on where you go. Here are the main difference of Singapore:1/ you have no idea what you are going to eat. (this said, they are really considerate of what you can and cannot eat, particularly if you are vegetarian). 2/ the waiters are blind themselves so this is a RAW experience - thing's can go wrong in the restaurant. There are no blindfolds etc.. it's just total darkness and that really makes you think about a lot. For a start, you appreciate your eye's a lot more! Your other senses take over and if you know your food you'll know what your eating ... if you don't ... hmm! This was really exciting as the 12 dishes were a mystery and smell and taste became so much more important. Funny how you appreciate taste a lot more when you can't see. This is a great experience for anyone who is interested in doing something different. I would have given it 5 stars but the food was average. The cocktails were great, would happily go just for drinks. Would I go again: No (only because I think it's a novelty experience)Would I recommend this: YES On a personal note, I am so happy that NOX is raising awareness of the visually disabled through this, those people truly are amazing and we have a lot to be thankful for
5
Went to nox with my family for their Singapore visit. We had the three course dining experience and we were pleasantly surprised by the amazing quality of food. The bill came to 500 for four persons but well worth it. The waiters are all visually impaired but their service is impecable.Each dish we had it was a tingling of ones taste senses. Each course was a plater of four small dishes that were each unique in their flavor. For starter the foie gras was the highlight. The main had an amazing duck dish and well cooked wagyu that had our taste buds guessing. The desert was a pleasant surprise with each item tasting better and better. Macaroons definitely was the highlight. Great for families. Well done to the chef and the restaurant for delivering
5
Its a brilliant Concept ,and offcourse 1st in Singapore.I have personally tried few before like this in different countries ,however the food quality and the amazing surpise menu will shock you.I never imagined that i can eat anything and still say its better than my normal meals i eat everyday.You will be warm welcomed when you reach by the restaurant staff ,and will have to wait in the lobby for a while till you are escorted upstairs to the Dark.If you have any dietary requirements ,you can always request it ,and don't be surprised when you finish your meal you will come to know what you really had ( Amazingyyy shocked to know i can actually eat that in my life ever)Its a bit overprized i believe paid 260+ for 2 people with double wine glasses ,however the experience was great and the food was great Will recomend for a marvelous experience for your loved ones or special occasion
5
Second time + I bought my dad for his birthday. We enjoyed the entire experience, as it sharpened the senses of hearing, touch and our taste buds :)I could even taste the figs and port wine reduction in the sauce, as well as chocolate fondant with rum and raisin ice cream! Highly recommend to try at least once
5
NOX provides a very interesting experience - to dine in the dark. my fiance and i had an amazing experience at NOX; from the excellent service to the food. we were amazed with the level of service from our waiter, Fabian, who is visually impaired. Fabian always ensured we were fine and attended to us promptly. we thoroughly enjoyed the food in pitch darkness and it made us more appreciative towards our sight which we can take for granted. after the dinner, we were led back down to the bar area. the restaurant manager showed and explained to us what we had. i had never eaten some items on the menu before but without my sight, i enjoyed it for what it tasted and not its physical appearance.an experience everyone should experience at least once in their life
5
Was given a short briefing by the ground crew before being lead away by the service crew, whom are visually blind. On service note, they provided excellent services.Service crew gave clear instructions on how to get the meal started. Cant help but started wondering subconsciously what "item" did I put in my mouth. Dishes served are savoury and unique to my opinion. Mocktail paring goes very well with the meals.Overall the experience was fantastic, allowing one to immense into the darkness while realizing that life is good when one has all intact. Highly recommend to anyone whom is looking for unique experience, yet don't mind the pricey.Note: Take your time to enjoy the food, no hurry to have them empty all at once. Mind you, it could be quite filling before the meal ends. Bon appÃ©ti
4
This is one of those places that everyone should go for once in their lives. It gives a deeper experience, and lets us truly value our five senses. Also, it was pretty fun to guess what we were eating, and seeing the results after when the staff explains them to you. The food was good, but pricey. I guess not being able to see my food presented in a fancy way, made the food itself feel less expensive. Nonetheless, no regrets! Would definitely good again (the menu changes regularly). Makes for a really good date night as your focus is wholly on your company and the food; no distractions! P.s. the bar downstairs serves really yummy drinks! Should try at least 1 drink while waiting for dinner.

The service is great, and had a good experience dining in a dark..Food was excellent too, the only thing to complain about maybe its the price being too pricey a little. Still, recommended to go once at least 
5
This was not the 1st time for me to dine in the dark. I was tried it in Kuala Lumpur for my friend's hens night. But for this time, I went it with my hubby in Singapore. There was another excellent experience for my hubby and me. Food was very nice and fabulous. I never try sea urchin before, but I felt it was yummy and will try to eat after that. This experience really nice for a group or even only two people go for explore. We can stop playing handphone during dinner and have a nice talk with each other. I will recommend my friend to go there to explore. Good job NOX
5
It was a very different experience. I had a lot of fun trying to guess what I was eating and getting used to sensing things rather than seeing them.I would definetly recommend it
4
I didn't enjoy the experience and personally I didn't rate the food. BUT my partner is a chef and he absolutely loved the experience and food! So maybe I just don't like the dark? Who knows!!!! My favourite part was the chocolate dessert. All the staff were lovely and very helpful. We even met the chef outside. Maybe in the light I would have had a different view!!!! Not for everyone. Keep an open mind ;
5
Had a very nice dinner here. With a (or more, could not see them) group there it was a bit noisy but the food was excellent. It's a set menu, and we had the cocktail pairing with it. This made the total quite high (2x cocktails is same price as 1x 4 course meal) and I would say not worth it. Just stick with the food and you'll have a great time
4
We went as a small group and we all enjoyed the experience. The food was very good though not really exceptional for the price we paid (around 90 sgd).Still, you really pay also for the experience. It was really fun to try to guess the food. The place is really dark and your eyes will not adjust at all. I recommend you just close your eyes at some point so your eyes will not be strained. The lounge area was nice and i think the staff, both in the lounge and those in the restaurant were very pleasant. There were some problems with our drink orders though that keep getting a bit mixed up. I also would not recommend the mocktail pairings as i thought they were very sweet and did not really match the food. But overall, i thought it was a really good exprience and it is worth to try. I would recommend it to my friends and will also consider coming back in a few months when they have the new menu.

Having been to the dining in the dark in HCMC, I was a bit disappointed with the experience at NOX.It starts already when you enter the place, you have a small bar with (a little too loud) music. Nice loungy place but nothing that gets you relaxed for dining in the dark. There is also minimal introduction. This is totally different compared to the place in HCMC where you get into a very calm environment, play a game blindfolded and then move on to the dark restaurant after proper explanation.Even during the dinner, everything was rushed. We were never asked or even served water. All was rush rush. They forgot our second wine pairing and the last dish was served wrongly (plates upside down) which caused the desserts we should have eaten first to be melted winds we ate them last. Also the tables next to use we heard the waiters ask regularly oh did you order this or that. A mistake can happen but this was too much confusion.After the dinner they'll explain you the menu in the bar downstairs. Very tough to understand the gentleman explaining since the music is pretty loud for this kind of setting. If you never plan to go to Vietnam, it's ok as a one time experience even though a little pricy for the quality you get but I highly recommend the one in HCMC
4
Amazing experience in a one of a kind setting.Make a booking early as it is quite crowded. Food was average not great but we had some excellent seafood that evenin
4
Incredible! The food alone was amazing but the opportunity to really get in touch with your senses and appreciate life was a once in a lifetime experience. I was touched by the story of our visually impaired waiter and it was fun to try and guess what you were eating. I highly recommend this experience
3
I will recommend people to try NoX since the experience of dining in the dark is really cool. Don't go in large group but prefer 2 or 3 people max. A blind person will guide you through the darky restaurant and help you get your forks, glass of wine and so on ! Honestly we went as a couple and laughed so much that I would go back... However I have to admit I have been very disappointed with food. It is very basic and not fine food at all. Supposedly there were foie gras, but believe me, I am French I can recognise this taste in the dark and there was none or very bad because it tasted like cheese..
4
It is a very interesting experience dining in complete darkness; not only it's a challenge to the taste buds but also give you a feel of what it's like to be visually impaired. The food are quite good - though not michelin quality but definitely pleasurable. The only thing I would complain is that the whole experience is a bit rush; we are required to finish four dishes (and a drink) in every 10 mins. The whole meal is under 1.5 hours. Being someone who likes to enjoy my food slowly, and with the price paid, I would expect a more relax dining atmosphere than what I had instead.
5
Been to this restaurant last night and loved it. Experience was very good and memorable. You don't know what you are eating, until you eat it. Staff are caring enough to consider food allergies and other restrictions. Very cooperative. Overall, awesome experience and unforgettable. Situated right across Arab street. Very easy to find
3
Embarking in an experience such as dining in the dark attacked me, and I did love that part.Not being able to control things that we take absolutely for granted does give me the vibes as I do love to try new things.It does enhance all your other senses when you don't have your sight. You wonder which way is the room placed, who is sitting next to you, where is your glass and your fork, you place your napkin carefully, you laugh and chat with your friends in a totally different way, and mostly you do wonder what you are eating and you try hard to guess. For this part, the experience is definitively worth it!As to the quality of the dishes, unfortunately it was not up to the expected standard. Considering you are eating in the dark, the decoration of the room may be just cement, the tableware may be bought in a supermarket and lack quality and design, and yet you pay quite an expensive bill. At least you could have good ingredients and cooked to perfection, but... that is not the case.If you enjoy new experiences, go for it! You will have a blast!If you are expecting a wonderful meal, forget it! you will leave disappointed
5
It was indeed a unique experience, with your sense of sight being taken away.Having to rely on just your sense of taste on food, your tastebuds really open up and we were able to really just enjoy food in its purest form. Our server was very professional and his instructions were clear and yet amiable. I like how he was so attentive to details, explaining to us clearly how to enjoy our dinner. His service was impeccable! Food wise, I am shocked to have tried food which I normally wouldn't think of. And they are actually really tasty and delicious! Thumbs up to the fresh ingredients and fusion cooking method! And at the end of our dinner, we are brought down to the bar area where the dishes are than revealed to us. Definitely coming back again!
5
This experience was incredible! I have never done anything like it and would highly recommend doing it whilst you're in Singapore.We tried lots of different foods - some were a bit strange for my liking, with random infusions and textures, but still good to try. I really liked that there were other people in the dark restaurant, we got chatting and attempted to guess each others age/ occupation etc. which was very funny! A must do
5
The best dining experience I have ever had! This is such an awesome and unique way to dine! It is legitimate, all in the dark - I'm talking, pitch black, can't even see your own hand in front of your face - dark! The food is absolutely amazing, and the accompanying cocktail pairing (optional) are superb! The people running the place are fantastically hospitable and welcoming, which makes this experience, so much better!The waitstaff are equally fantastic, and blind too! Everyone's sense of humour and approach to this concept is phenomenal.Be sure to let them know about any dietary requirements, so they can make amendments accordingly!! I would absolutely, 100% return with more people!!! Definitely worth checking out!!!!
3
The experience is very interesting but...As it was Friday, the restaurant was full & the waiter ask us few times to eat faster. He was polite but the message was clear. We stayed 1h15 including the time to go to our table.Food is good but value for money is not. There is also too much savors: spicy, seafood, meat, fish... a big mix of everyday meals! Maybe 2 starters 2 main 2 dessert will be enough!
2
There's something about high-end restaurants that won't serve tap water that bugs us. If it's the profit margin on the beverage, why not up the price of the meal by a few dollars and throw in a bottle of tap water? Or perhaps charge a service fee for the glasses, etc. But having to drink bottled water when the public supply is perfectly safe feels unnecessary to us. We asked our host Jeremy if NOX could charge more for the meal and serve tap water (in a bottle if we were to have the experience of puring it out for ourselves) but he said he couldn't as it was a hygiene issue. We would have rated the restaurant a notch or two higher if not for this unpleasantness. We won't be back.The meal itself was interesting. The three-course menu is fixed (though dietary constraints are catered for). Taster-sized portions of each of four starters, mains and desserts plus the amuse bouche, for a total of 13 dishes. The quality ranged from average to excellent, the starters and desserts definitely scoring over the mains. Service was prompt and friendly. A tad expensive for the quality but probably worth one visit for the experience of dining it complete darkness - gimmicky, but fun, and enhances appreciation for the sense of sight. Almost the only topic of conversation for our group of four was the meal we were eating - somehow taking away sight made us all focus on what we were eating. We won't describe the dishes as half the fun is trying to guess what one ate - and we made some interesting mistakes.But coming back to the incident with the water, pricey dining does have to be a bit about the experience too, for us. Our evening was devalued by the bit about the water, so our evening at NOX was overall, not a great experience
5
Heard of this place for awhile but never try it till it became a surprise on my birthday. Totally out of the world dining experience . Sorry can't reveal too much else it's no longer special. I can only say it's a great experience , especially for a foodie like me. Thank you my love for the arrangement . Love it. A memorable birthday to remember.
4
Truly enjoyed the experience. Had 3 courses of 4 sides each (total 12 items) for $88++. The food was fantastic! Service was great as well. A truly unique experience where one has to dine in the dark & rely on taste bug to guess the food. Menu will b revealed after meal
2
Their cocktails are absolutely delicious and look fantastic. The staff are very friendly and its quite an experience.I ordered a vegan option when dining but was quite disappointed afterwards when they unveiled what I had eaten. When showing me what I had eaten, the images of my food and the menu contained eggs, mayonnaise and ice cream. All vegan dishes were in fact vegetarian according to them. When looking through my friends menu (non-vegan/vegetarian) I noticed certain dishes were exactly the same as mine, but they simply took out the meat elements from my dish at the last minute. I was quite sceptical to believe them that I had eaten a vegan meal. Overall it was a great experience to be in a similar situation as the blind but just disappointed in the food especially for the price.
3
It's a fantastic thing to try out however we found that the service was patchy and often felt a bit rushed. The wine was average but the food pretty good. Cocktails were excellent. Crazy experience well worth trying out
5
On the pricey side but totally worth the experience!! Food is simple but delicious and service was wonderful! Very impressed and would recommend if you wanna have a new dining experience!
5
The food is excellent, and I really enjoyed the pre-dinner cocktail too.Service is great as well, they were very helpful to adapt food to my allergies. And then of course there's the unforgettable experience of eating food in the pitch black darkness, guessing what you eat, and enjoying it without seeing it. This place is worth the visit esp. for the special occasions, even with the price tag. They change menu each month, so I went twice already and will go again
5
I booked a table at NOX to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. Since it's the first time I'm celebrating his birthday together, I wanted a unique experience for him. NOX was really patient with my queries and requests. I requested for a birthday cake and this was delivered to my boyfriend in surprise after our dinner. Dinner was great and we loved the whole experience of eating in the dark. It's undisturbed and fantastic experience to our taste buds! With the amount of quality food served, the price is definitely worth it! The cocktails were great too!A must try at least once
4
Celebrated my husband's birthday. The food is great and the experience is a must try! The experience is unique and also makes you appreciate and understand the visually handicapped friends.

Drinks are ordered prior to going to the dark room - we choose to pair a wine with each of the 3 courses (2 or the 3 wines were very good). But the menu itself is a complete secret until the end.Being led to the pitch black dinning room was both fun & scary at the same time. The guide (who is blind) leads the way with the 5 of us following with our hands on the shoulders of the one in front (a little tip - if in a group go shortest to tallest as you go up steep stairs). The first test of total darkness is trusting the guide & the person in front to not lead you into a wall, the next is trying to work out where everyone is sitting. The waiter Fabian was extremely good - telling us what to expect & guiding drinks into our hands with ease, asking us about ouselves & chatting to us while delivering & whisking away food without us even knowing.My only criticism is that I did not know that we were not given very long to finish the first course & as a result I totally missed one of the 4 dishes & had to drink my wine too quickly before it disappeared.If you have a particular dislike - tell them before you go in to the dark room. One of our group did not like seafood & they changed his dishes at the last minute to suit that request. They also cater well to vegetarians - but be prepared because some dishes are not to everyone's taste & you can't tell until you have bitten into it. I hate eggs & got a big mouthful of one - but then that is all part of the experience too.At the end - you are again led out in total darkness where you fill in a questionnaire to try to guess what you ate. The hostess then shows a picture of each dish & explains the ingredients in each one.As a dining experience, this is unique & a lot of fun. It also gave me valuable insight into how it must be to live without sight. Respect to all those who do

Its a very interesting experience, u started in a lounge area and being welcome by their friendly staff, u can then tell them ur dietary requirement and order ur drink first (the drink will serve with meal in the dark), they will tell you its a 3 course meal but you have no idea on the menu.There are lockers for your belongings and they will lead u to the dining room, its entirely dark, anything neon color needs to be removed.All courses are served on a plate with 4 different containers, waiter will tell you the directions to start with. Its very interesting how much we focus on our vision, its difficult to tell the ingredients without it. After dinner, the staff will sit down with you and reveal the menu with their ipad, we were quite surprise of quite few dishes.I would like to make a fair comment, the customer service was really good, staff are all friendly, the idea of dining in a dark room also worth trying and its unique.However, the food was not up to standard, its totally disappointed, the wine was served hot and it does taste terrible. We didnt finish most of the food, which is a shame because the staff said the chef put in so much effort on making the ingredients from scratch. I would not come back again because of the food, the bill was about SGD 250 for two person, its a fine dining price but the food doesnt match with the service, the food needs a massive improvement to keep the customer coming back.

It is a learning experience for me as I am able to feel how visually handicapped I can be without the guidance from the
4
Basically the underlying concept of the restaurant aims to bring about awareness for the visually impaired. At the same time, ambiance is really good at the holding area while waiting for your seats. The service is superb. All the staffs (they are real visually impaired individuals) patiently assists you and exceptionally helpful! Due to my allergy with seafood, the chef made an effort to redesign their menu of the week so as to cater for my allergies! I was really glad and touched. Not forgetting this means that I'll be tasting something different from everyone else. My taste buds were really being put to the test when I had to learn firsthand on how to maneuver around my food in pitch darkness. I would say the overall experience is quite a daunting yet highly interesting one. It may be a bit pricey, but I personally feel that this experience is worthy of how much you're paying
5
I have been here twice and both the times, I have been more than impressed. They now have a vegetarian menu and it is very tasty. The food was so good!! The science behind this is obviously that when one sense is blocked, the others amplify and this definitely checks out. My taste buds were exploding!! The food was like magic. What made this experience unforgettable, although, was the service. Jeremy was incredibly helpful and he took great care of us. The waiters, who were blind also took really amazing care of us and that made a huge impact for me and my family. The staff and waiters were helpful and extremely welcoming. They were all friendly and treated us very well
5
Although a bit pricey, this dining experience is truly unique and worth trying at least once. The staff was wonderfully pleasant and accommodating. You begin the experience in the downstairs lounge to start with drinks, and then you are briefed about what to expect in the upstairs dining rooms. Your group then meets the serving staff (all of whom are blind), who then take you upstairs in pitch black and assist with seating you at your table. The "Mystery Menu" is 3 courses (4 dishes each), and is served in small bowls for easy consumption. It was quite interesting trying to determine the ingredients in each dish, which resulted in fun conversation with my dining partners. After the meal, you're brought back downstairs where you can have more drinks (optional), and the staff shows you each course on an iPad and describes the ingredients (you fill out a questionnaire with your guesses prior to the big reveal). Overall, it was a fun evening with good drinks and tasty cuisine
4
It is an amazing experience to dine in total darkness. Upon arrival , the impeccable service impresses you and starts you off on a great dining experience. At the lounge downstairs, you are given the drinks menu and not the food menu (you don't get to choose the food). They guide you to how to eat the dishes and explain how things are done upstairs in pitch black environment. Once you have chosen your drinks (top up $) , you are offered to use the bathroom and lock your items in their locker provided. You are not allowed any personal items upstairs. After that, you will be introduced to the staff in charge of you (pls note they are blind or partially blind so don't make rude remarks like - can you see) and led upstairs. Holding shoulders of the staff or your partner, you slowly walk into the dark. It can be a little scary but trust the staff and trust yourself. The food is brought to you along with your drinks. They have a setup so don't be an irritating person to mess with the staff and change the table setting or stack your food trays etc. The food is amazing. Not knowing what you get, just try everything. Delicious food is served to you with great service. Your other senses are heightened and it can be a little daunting. Your tastebuds seem to tast everything. After being in the dark for about 30 minutes, my eyes hurt a little and I got a bit dizzy and breathless. Distracted myself and continued to enjoy the food. You will be led back downstairs and remember to keep your eye close and open them slowly to get your eyes adjusted back to the light. The staff will give you some questionnaire to fill and show you the food you just ate. Fun to guess the dishes ! Prices are not cheap but it's worth the experience. Menu changes time to time so it's not boring. But I think one time experience is good enough .I would recommend this
3
It's a novel concept, eating in complete darkness, guided by blind waiters. My girlfriend and I went looking for an interesting experience and we did get it. Enjoyed the guessing game of what food we were eating, identifying the dish as well as the individual components that make it up. However, the food itself was just so-so, and didn't really find anything to rave about. Worth trying once, but struggling to think of what to come back for
5
The greeting on ground level was warm and instructional. This is a very different experience! We were asked our dining preferences and any dietary requirements, then after shedding all vestiges of electronic and light emitting devices we were escorted upstairs in complete inky darkness by a sight impaired waiter, seated and the table layout, courses etc. explained.You cannot describe the feelings of distress (not being able to see anything and rely on your other senses) the anticipation of what you were going to get in each course (you are given 4? square dishes in each course with instructions on eating clockwise.) the idea is you are meant to guess what is in each, this will be revealed after your meal over a debrief downstairs.I was surprised at how quickly you would rely on where things were and could quite easily find my wine/water/utensils within minutes almost every time!I admire the wait staff who could navigate the restaurant without collision. Very impressed
5
Went with colleagues for dinner.Was impressed by the blind waiter serving us in the pitch black dark room.A good experience to have a feel of the visually impaired world.Use our heart to see not our eyes.
5
It was a unique experience! We were brought up to a room that is in complete darkness and were told to consume our food in a particular order. Not being distracted (by light, sight) actually makes you focus a lot more on your food (as you will be curious what you're eating) hence you get to appreciate the food better. Con is that it's expensive! I guess it's one of those things you do it once to get that experience :)
5
Went to Nox for our Anniversary Dinner with high expectations given its price. The experience exceeded it! This place had amazing service staff who guided us through the process well. Over the course of dinner, we were well taken care of in a terribly dark room by the visually impaired wait staff. It was a great experience and I found myself empathizing more with them. Menu was surprisingly good as well. The dark room heightens your senses. Throughout the whole duration, my partner and I were constantly surprised with the different tastes and associations we had to the ingredients. Cocktails were fantastic too! Not a placed to be missed, we will definitely be back
4
Food was ok. It's not bad but it's also not amazing. Still, your senses are affected and the food experience is enhanced. Some things don't work well technically - how can you see if the bottle of wine is as you've ordered (couldn't help worrying we are getting ripped off more than usual)? And of course while some senses are enhanced, the old adage of you eat with your eyes first... I'd be more interested in doing something else other than eating in the dark..
4
My husband surprised me on my birthday by taking me to Nox for dinner. It was an absolutely unforgettable experience. You are first asked to leave behind all your electronic items, which can emit light (so good to be phone-less for a bit), then you're guided to the restaurant by a blind waiter (I absolutely love this concept). You're taken to your seat and told to feel around the table for your cutlery. It is pitch dark and a little uncomfortable at first as you have no idea where you're located, if there are other people around you etc. It's almost like giving up control. After a while, my other senses took over and I started enjoying the feeling. We automatically started speaking in hushed voices and waited for our food to arrive. It's a 3 course secret menu and each course has 4 small dishes (you can of course notify them of any food restrictions when you make a reservation). You focus on the flavours much more than you normally would, probably also because you don't know what you're eating. We enjoyed all the food and also debating with each other about what exactly we were eating ( obviously we would totally wrong in the end). Once you're done with your meal, your guided back down by your blind waiter to go and wait in the sitting area. Here you re-accustom yourself to the bright light and wait for someone to come and show you pictures of what you just ate. It was a fabulous experience and I would love to do it again. It is a little heavy on the pocket and therefore something I would recommend for a special occasion
3
A good one off educational experience. They had good food on the tasting menu, but with darkness you quickly realize taste is sight as well as smell and feel. Inside having the meal the environment was pitched black. When done, you walk out and they tell you what you just ate through a quiz. My recommendation, throw away the fork and eat with your fingers
5
I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience in pitch dark. Starting from the time when we had to be ushered up the flight of stairs all the way to our seats. It's true that in pitch dark that you can thoroughly tantalize your tastebud. Albeit expensive, the experience was enjoyable. Not to mention, the dishes tasted real good! Will be back definitely :
5
Would definitely recommend this for people who are not claustrophobic and scared of the dark. It was an experience with heightened senses.
4
Nox is not your usual restaurant. It's in pitch black darkness and the waiter that bring you around are all visually challenged. But here, you are the one challenged as they can move normally while you being the clumsy one. Food here is fantastic even though you do not see what you are eating. At the end of the dinner, it will be revealed and you can see how well or badly you have done in terms of guessing. Don't be shocked that you mistaken duck for beef or chicken for something else. Soon you will realized that you have been eating with your eyes and not actually tasting the food all this while
3
Not bad , but expensive. If you never try is something of different, different taste and nice experience.. but I don't know if the the value covers the price.
5
Six stars and not five stars for the experience Eating in the dark , pitch dark and it challenges you to use all your senses it is difficult for first 10 minutes and then you get comfortable and enjoy it Three course meal and the food is delicious with nice wine pairing ( optional ) you are lead to your pitch dark table and served by visually impaired staff who are lovable and friendly it is a surreal experience to feel what they go through all the time. In the end they ask you to guess the food and tell you the excellent menuThere are only 15 such restaurants in the world and therefore must be experienced. It is expensive about 130 sgd with the wine but who said that good things come cheap. I don't want to let out further secrets so happy exploration
4
Been here twice within a month - first time was to try it for the experience and everyone enjoyed it. Came here for a second time within a month because I had guests from out of town and I simply wanted them to try something different. Again everyone enjoyed the experience.The service is good, and the food is not too bad. I didn't enjoy every dish but I enjoyed at least the majority of the dishes.The whole experience will take between one to two hours. They serve a set menu and it is pricey, but you are paying for the experience.
4
When u having the dining . The enviroment is totally in the dark. You will experienced fear at first. Afterward i try to use my hands ,ears and nose to feel the sound nearby and the texture of the food. I totally feel the blind servers are aweaome and appreciate how they live and feel in the life. Worth to go once in tour life
5
I been there tonight with my daughter 14 y old, she never try that kind of place before, but she's always open for discover new things.Reception was great, all staff very friendly.Food was really good test, baste dark restaurant I did till now.Price is not cheap... But is singapore so I guess it's normal for that kind of diner.Will come back
4
I took my husband here for his birthday. He probably did not enjoy it as much as i did as we had differing opinions on it. The food was definitely good but not great. The service was good, however at the end they forgot to take us down and we were left sitting there for quite a long time. We also were grouped together with a bunch of teenagers who were very loud and noisy and there were 2 couples in this group (us and another) and someone from the other room had to shush them. It would have been good if the grouping was more appropriate. We are left wondering if the price is really worth it. Between here and Rhubarb, I would choose Rhubarb anytime. They are a mid range restaurant trying to be fine dining and using the novelty of dining in the dark to charge exorbitant prices
5
The man decided to surprise me for my birthday with this!!! And I had a really amazing experience.....it really makes me appreciate what we, the ones who have been gifted with sight takes for granted.... Before being ushered upstairs to the dining area (there are 4 partitioned sections), we were served some Amuse Bouche along with choiced cocktails. Bags and mobiles are to deposited into lockers (which is actually a fantastic idea so that patrons do actually conversed with each other without gadgets interruption). Going up the stairs and to our table, we had to hold onto the shoulder of our assigned host Fariz. We were also instructed on how to eat (clockwise) and to call out if we need anything (obviously waving will do nuts!!)Eating in total pitch darkness and feeling awkward with handling a pair of cutlery and I then succumbed to only using a spoon and poking my dishes with fingers.... There are a total of 4 Appetisers, 4 Mains and 4 Desserts. And the food is actually awesome (although some I had no idea what I was eating!!) . Although I think the dishes can be cut down to 2 each so as not to overwhelm the senses too much...I mean we don't often eat 4 of each on a normal day!After the meal, we were led to the stairs but this time it's like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. We had our coffee at the waiting lounge and was given a survey to test our food awareness. I was surprised that I had mistook duck (confit for pork) although I did get some right! Yay!This is definitely a must try! And yes, they do check with you regarding food allergies and restraints. The menu are changed every 6 weeks and the Chef Desmond Lee has worked along side Gordon Ramsay, and was nominated as Chef of the Year by the World Gourmet Summit in 2015

Visited for my early birthday celebration! Heard of this concept, but to experience it is a totally different matter altogether! Ushered to a reception area for cocktails and pre-dinner briefing.Service staff who briefed us on what to expect was fun and engaging! Checked with us on food allergies etc.We were led to our tables in a pitch black dinning area by a visually impaired service staff. We had such fun sampling the 12 different food items and trying to clink our wine glasses in the dark! We selected wine pairing with our menu.Towards the end, there's a little quiz to see if we could identify what were the 12 items we ate!I would highly recommend it if you are adventurous and looking for a new experience!
2
Had an upset stomach after the dinner! The wine was poor and didn't go well with the food. The experience of eating in the dark is interesting but not worth the S$ 250
4
Nox is really a special, interesting and unnerving restaurant.For the first time, there were no ring tones heard and not a single diner was "heard" using the mobile phone - everyone was engaging with each other and this alone, was sufficient to realise that this was indeed a moving eating experience.The place was pitch dark and while climbing up the stairs, a few diners opted to drop out - definitely not a place for those with claustrophobia.All the waiters are from the Association of theVisually handicapped and eating here will give you a glimpse of an eating experience similar to those of the visually handicapped and understand how fortunate we are and how much we take our sights for granted.Food taste better as one of the senses is cut off and most of us have to rely on our primitively developed olfactory and gustatory senses.Suddenly, chicken tastes like pork and spinach tastes like cabbage.Wonder if we are all conscious of what food we are TASTING if not for our mental imprint of the food through our visual input.Great cooks eat with their nose and their tastebuds - I think ?Dressing up food is superficial.FOOD - Just like any humans, behind our facade of fashionable clothes and makeup, the real aroma and umami is revealed when the visual is obscured - Like in NOX

This has been a great experience in the darkest place I have ever been. The food looks good (in pictures) cocktails are sophisticated and service is great. Good cause and good educational message. A bit on the expensive side, but if you have the budget is a good fun activity

I went there twice.In terms of service - The first experience was great - Jason, our server, was very courteous and patient considering the fact that we were a big group and hard to manage (went there with my officemates for our Christmas dinner). We never had to wait long for the next dish to come and we were always excited to see what was next to come.With the great experience I had the first time, I thought of bringing my BF and his friends to Nox for his birthday. Unfortunately, we didn't get the same attentiveness of the server as I had the first time. It was not Jason and unfortunately, I don't remember the server's name. It took him so long to get our food served. We had to sit there and wait in the dark and hope that he will come back for us soon. It was a bit frustrating.In terms of food -Both times that I was there, I was never disappointed. Food was great - the taste, the smell, texture, everything!Tip: 1. Make sure to remember your server's name. So if you feel like you've been waiting and sitting in the dark for quite a while and have no clue when you're next dish is coming, you can call his attention by calling his name. 2. Do make a reservation before going there as they are always fully booked. You can either call them or via their Facebook page.3. If you have allergies on some food (or do not eat spicy food), you can inform them before you get ushered to your assigned seat

The food is definitely not worth the price. It is precooked and microwaved. An other important information: "this restaurant doesn't serve tap water". That tells you all about their sense of hospitality!The experience of eating in the dark is interesting and the staff upstairs was very friendly, but overall, this was a very disappointing experience. I am extremely surprised by the number of rave reviews for this restaurant and I would definitely not recommend this plac

We arrived full of anticipation as this was such a novel idea. It was great!! We were guided up the stairs by Zee our blind waiter, he brought us to the table and our chairs which we had to feel before sitting on. Then we felt all around the table to find cutlery and water glass and most importantly the edge of the table. Foods served on a wooden platter with 4 bowls, starting at 6 o clock we worked our way around clockwise. Mostly bringing the bowl close to our mouths. Managed to drop one piece each. The food was chopped up so it would fit on the fork or spoon, no knives needed. Was interesting to find the wine glass, we both put it somewhere relative to the cutlery and remembered the o clock it was at. Pouring water was interesting too - had to put our fingers in the top of the glass - when wet, stop. Can't tell when the glass is near empty until you drink it. Some people don't handle the dark and leave but we were all good. I was pleased to get back to the light again after the 2 hours. We had to then guess what we'd eaten - we got 10/14 so our host was pretty impressed. Didn't pick up on the duck.... Highly recommend to provide an experience of how it is to live in a dark world. Overall great experience but it was pricey for good but not great food. Staff were excellent at adding to the atmosphere.

Dined here last night, the whole experience was excellent and one I would recommend anyone to try. The food was very tasty, nothing too outrageous which makes the whole experience a bit more relaxing!Only gripe for me is that for the entire meal including drinks cost $300 SD which felt expensive given the entire dining experience only lasted just over an hour and was effectively the food for a 3 course meal. To get value for money I would expect either higher quality food or a longer experience. All in all though a throughly enjoyable night with great service and would recommend everyone to try it.

My husband and I came here on a whim during a short stay in Singapore and it's been an experience we've loved sharing with others ever since.We were greeted in the bar-lounge area and given a delicious sampler as well the drink menu to select our pairings with dinner. The concept was explained to us, that all the servers are blind or severely visually impaired, and we were given a key to a locker to relieve us of any light-producing objects. We were the introduced to our waiter and walked up the stairs.The food itself is delicious. It is essentially 12 mini dishes, 4 with each course, and each is a sensory adventure as you try to figure out what you're eating and save the best parts for last. It forces you to be more mindful about your eating and the small plates still fill you up. Even their drink pairings were unique and matched the food very well. At the end, they do a debriefing and you can see how accurate your taste buds were.They are also very conscious about dietary preferences and change their menu every 5 weeks, so you can keep coming back to test your skills as a culinary expert! We would highly recommend

My husband took me here for my birthday dinner. It was an amazing and unique experience. Do not be afraid of trying it, your senses adjust pretty fast and it's incredible to have a whole meal without knowing what you are eating. I loved trying to guess what we were eating with my husband. I think is a great to bring your significant other to share something different and interesting together! The food was pretty tasty too :
5
It was indeed an amazing yet fascinating experience which feels our heart. Brought my boyfriend there specially for his birthday celebration. Read reviews about how amazing it was and so decided to give it a try. Indeed, fabulous was the only word to describe the amazing experience because the combination of mouth watering food and dining in the dark was something worth the try. Guessing the food item was fun and tasting the food in the dark allows you to not be choosy of on the side note, you gotta finish what's serve to you! Recommended and overall service was fantastic!
5
It was a very special dinner as your senses were pushed a bit to the limit - very interesting and really nice food and service. Time just flew by - all in all a fantastic experience.

Came here for a friend's birthday dinner and we were not disappointed. We were greeted by a friendly Australian guy who briefed us on the food and drink to be expected.As with most of my reviews, below are a list of pros and cons following the meal we had:Pros:* Friendly greetings all round - our waiter provided great service (a visually impaired gentleman called Zee?)* All food is boneless and served in bowls which are easy to scoop from, no need to cut anything* My 3 friends and I chose the drinks pairing and they went well with the food* The wait staff enquire if we have any allergies/food issues prior to the meal* You are totally reliant on smell and taste from the appetiser onwards* The debrief session after dinner is as interesting as the meal itself... trying to figure out the aromas and tastes* The menu changes every 4-6 weeks so you are not going to get the same food if you space out your visits* As you are in the dark, it really is a blind date (pun intended) if you are going with your significant other* If you are going in a group, you will be very reliant on conversation so best to go with chatty friends/family/colleagues* Employment opportunities for the visually impaired (mentioned by another reviewer)Cons:* Personal thing but I was not a fan of the foie gras (didn't realise it was served until afterwards)* Unfortunately, for the social media junkies, guests are not allowed to bring your phone with you to the table so forget about taking food photos* In the debrief session, taking photos of the food photos is also not allowed (lol)* Price was a bit on the high side* As the dining room is upstairs and bathroom is downstairs, this may be a headache for those who are less mobileAll in all, I would happily do it again as I have never dined in the dark prior to this. The ambience seemed good as there were other groups there but luckily it wasn't too noisy though it felt like many people were there
5
Great experience for my teenagersâ˜ºThey have to raise their heads and talk to their parents about how they feel about things around them at that moment. Fun time
5
Was treated to this venue for my Birthday and boy was it exciting. They start you off with some drinks while you await for a briefing where they explain to you how to go about your dinner. You are then led upstairs to the restaurant where it is totally dark! Like you can't see your hands kind of dark! Your meal begins and wow, does that added sense from not being able to see kick in. I somehow appreciated the taste of my food more then usual. After dinner you are then brought back down for a debrief where they show you pictures of your meal which was interesting to see as you recall moments from your meal. Thing I also like about this restaurant is that it supports employment for the visually impaired which is a whole lot of awesome
2
The problem with "concept restaurant" is that all is in the concept. Once you have been through it, you are left with a food that is quite average
4
I brought my wife to NOX for dinner on Valentine's Day & it was one of the best dining experience that we had. The experience of dining in the total darkness was mind blowing and special, it also allow you to pay more attention to the taste of the food, instead of the visual aspect, which was very good.The attentiveness and service from the service crew, especially from the main server in the dark room (sorry, i forgot his name), was excellent. He was constantly checking if everything was OK, whether did we freak out dining in the dark, whether the food was to our liking etc......This is a place that I will definitely return
4
The concept of dining in total darkness has been around for a number of years, but this was my first time. I purposely did not look at the representative menu on-line because I wanted the challenge of taste identification. Yes, it is totally dark in the dining area, although entry to the restaurant is a normally lit bar and lounge area. There are storage lockers for your cell phone, watch, or any light emitting gadget so as not to spoil the "atmosphere". Waiters are blind or visually impaired and use a system of clicks and whistles to keep out of each other's way.The food is very good and if this were a normal restaurant, it would be considered upscale simply because of food quality. What made it difficult to identify each dish was the fact that each portion was a complete plate and not just one item, so you may have a meat, potato or grain, and sauce on one plate. Three courses with four plates for each course is a lot of food and with several items in each dish it's very difficult to sort out the tastes. I quickly found that using my fingers to touch the food improved my ability to discern texture, shape, and consistency of the dishes. In fact eating with my hands was easier than trying to get the food on a fork or spoon. Imagine what a blind person has to do to keep up with expected eating habits when eating with their hands would be much easier!When the eating is finished, back in the lounge area, you are given a little written test to see what you remembered and could identify. Then you are presented with the menu to compare. I thought I'd be pretty good at figuring out the food, but alas, I was less than 50% correct. Popcorn in the ice cream, really?If you're the least bit adventurous, this is a fun "off the beaten path" experience. BTW, your meal can be adjusted for any food allergy or specification
4
This was my first dinning in the dark experience, and it was unique, I won't say that I like it so much that I will come again and again, but it's an experienceI recommend to atleast experience it onc
5
Have got nothing but great things to say. The staff are very friendly and welcoming, they explain the concept and everything to you.We had two guides who were incredibly helpful. The food is great and tastes amazing. We had the pairing cocktails which is also a must do.Just come and do this unique experience,it won't disappoint you
5
What a unique experience! Anyone who visits Singapore should definitely check out Nox! I don't want to describe everything because I want you to experience all of this yourself but I will say that they had the best food, the best drinks, and the best service! And they were very accommodating for my multiple food sensitivities! Will definitely be going there again!
5
Its a whole new experience and goes back to the very basic of dining, glorious food without wasting minutes to snapchat or take pictures. I am very impressed by the service standard becos its comfortable, it sets you in the mood for the meal, some restaurants are too pushy and may appear stressing at times, you wont find it here.Food wise is excellent becos u wont know what you be having prior, so you let them know of your dietary requirements and such during the reception
5
This is an incredible experience, where you eat in the compete darkness, you can not see anything. You are guided thru a three course meal, each course consisting of 4 dishes. Your other senses are heightened and the food is delicious. I was able to match my dishes to a cocktail list, which was divine. Our waiter Rohammad was incredible
5
This is definitely a must when in Singapore the staff are absolutely amazing. You will not be disappoined
4
Nice concept, amazing and out of the world experience. It's kinda awakens your senses. Paying all your attention to just food, what you are eating, no distractions. Menu had varieties of meat options and covered almost everything that I wanted to taste at this European restaurant. Staff was really very friendly and courteous. A little bit on the expensive side though. Should visit for a different dining experience
4
The experience is totally different, unlike any other dinner outings. To not see your food really heightens the taste. By itself, the food is also of a good calibre. Since going there 2 nights ago, I have already urged many friends to go!
5
The trip to NOX was introduced by a friend and there was quite a high level of expectation based on his review. But I must say, NOX had lived up to the expectations.From the customer service to the quality of food, it was a top notch experience. In addition, the experience of dining in pitch black has always been an exciting thought. Although rummaging in the dark to find your food and drinks was an arduous task, the waiters were very patient and helpful on ensuring the experience was a manageable one without you going all insane about it.The quality and taste of the food was exceptionally well done, perhaps also because of the heightened senses in the dark, we were able to taste the little flavours in the food like never before. Overall, five stars and a must go in our opinion. With the menu changing every 6-8 weeks, we are looking forward to the next one!Menu included foie gras, steak, cod fish etc. Tastefully done
5
Came here on a date last year and it was simply the best dinner date I have ever been on. Though it might be slightly on the higher side of the price scale, it is definitely worth every penny! I was extremely blown away by the level of service and the wonderful experience. I will not spoil the surprise for everyone else, but trust me, this is worth a try
4
We were a bit worried the experience might be a bit Disney at the expense of the food but it was fantastic! Beautiful dishes, plenty of food and the system was well explained. We were seated next to a group who unfortunately were a dish ahead of us and voiced their ideas about the dishes a bit loudly which spoiled our guessing a bit. But when we asked if they could speak a bit more quietly they very graciously switched to another language! We took on the wine matching and are pleased we did. Our only small criticism would be that we felt a bit rushed ( would have been better to have longer pauses between courses). Recommend both the experience and the food
5
greeted by lovely aussie staff and canapÃ©s, relaxed at the bar and was led by their staff to a dark room to enjoy a lovely 12 course meal. their staff are visually handicap and they were all professional and help us feel calm in the dark. it was an interesting experience, made me not take my eyesight for granted. good was very yummy. highly recommended
5
great experience at dine in the dark! amazing conscientious staff and. exciting atmosphere and fun concept! a must try! 12 delicious courses so we rolled out of the place in a blissful food coma. we were told regularly changing menu too so would be keen to go bac
5
Having heard and seen the great reviews, I knew I have to come and NOX did not disappoint. When we walked into the premises, we were warmly welcome to chill out at the bar, we were briefed about the procedures and what to expect. Please pay attention to the briefing as that is exactly what will happen when you lose your vision. Good was great.... Food was fantastic. They were served in 4 small sampler portions and you need to eat them in clockwise directions. A good tip is to bring the bowl directly to your mouth rather than trying to pick the food off the bowl as when the food drops, you have no idea where it went :) wearing black is another tip, just in case when you have no idea the food actually drops on you, at least a black shirt can disguise all the food stain marks when you walk back into the bright side
5
It was an amazing experience. I did feel slightly uneasy at the start being in the dark and was not sure if I could stay in that situation however after a few minutes once we were all chatting and the food started coming I settled into it quite well. It was great to sit around with everyone chatting instead of looking at their phones. The food was really good with a mixed variety of flavours and highlighted how much we don't pay attention to the flavour when trying to guess what the items were. The staff were very pleasant and although a bit prices it was worth the experience and my future visitors I will take back here to also experience this. It also does help you understand the struggles blind people have to overcome and how lucky we are to have our sight that we take for granted.Lorna

This is a must do experience, yes it's not cheap but for 3 courses (4 dishes each course), appetiser and 3 cocktails I think it's very good value for money (I paid $162 including tip and tax). The service was excellent from everyone we encountered especially our waiter Zee who was very attentive and took great care of us. The food was delicious, a variety of flavours and it was fun trying to guess what you were eating. It was also nice to leave your phones behind and have a real conversation. Probably not a place for a first date or important business meeting but great for friends, couples or colleagues who want to try somewhere a bit different. Go with an open mind and do tell them of any dietary needs (including things you really don't like) before because you won't be able to decide once you are seated if you want to eat something or not - not before you have put it in your mouth anyway! It was fun afterwards finding out what was in the dishes, although one did have something that I always said I would never eat for moral reasons but I didn't even think of it to tell them before. And I enjoyed it. Oops! Everyone should try this at least once, unless you are afraid of the dark or so fussy with food that it would be wasted on you. Thanks Nox and Ze

We were a group of 5 to go there and it was for all of us our first dinner in the dark. The experience was absolutely fantastic and we had a lot of fun. The service is great (from the beginning until the end you are well taken care of), and the food is good. I did not find the food especially amazing (but my colleagues did) however the experience and people there are so great that I can easily recommend this place. Good experience for team building
5
Cannot recommend this highly enough from the moment you walk through the door to the minute you leave you are well taken care of through every aspect of the experience. Food was excellent but I think what made it for me were the waiters - a very humbling experience

First time dine in the Dark.I've seen this concept of restaurant in other country. Enjoying food in complete dark. This is more high-end version. Good things: no mobiles, no lights are allowed in dining area, so you can actually get the joy of conversation back!: you could hold your partner's hand while eating: another fun to guess what are the ingredients! : interesting event!: every 6 weeks, whole menus change. : 4 appetizers, 4 mains, 4 deserts are overall very good. I especially love appetizers and deserts. Downside: well.. It is pricy (almost $200/person): dinner is relatively short(50 mins of waiting then 1hr of dining. But it's like a firework. Short but strong ;D): No dining photos Suggestion: drinks are totally personal choice but if you are cocktail drinker, enjoy in the waiting hall. Matching wine was pretty goo but cocktails were so so to me. And cocktails are way better when you see them.
5
I thought it was fun to eat in the dark ..... Until i was actually guided to a total-dark room and slowly the lights are out. I immediately felt cautious and excited at the same time. Then came the appetizer, main, and desert. The first bite was quite a bit challenging, but i get used to it quickly. But the best part is the anticipation. Because i didnt know what would come next and how it would taste. Me and my friends quickly change guesses while enjoying the meal. It was an overall exciting experience indeed!!
5
We have already recommended this amazing experience/place to several fellow travellers whilst we've been in Singapore, Borneo and Bali. From the moment you walk through the their door, to the moment you leave, is a truly enjoyable assault on your senses. The staff are friendly and welcoming. And look after you through each step of your journey. My advice! Try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed. xx
5
I was greeted by the warm and friendly staff when I entered. They gave us an appetizer and we ordered some drinks. Absolutely fell in love with both! The staff recommended some drinks to us according to our taste. It was definitely the best cocktails that I have had so far! After which one of the staff explained the procedure to us. Our awesome and friendly waiter then brought us up and also informed us of the pathway while we were going up. It made us feel safe. Once we seated, the first course was brought in. I was too excited! After which, slowly one by one they brought in the other 2 courses. What I really loved about the food was that there was a huge variety and the different dishes just simply amused my palate. One we were back down, we were told to guess what we have eaten and then were told what we actually ate. I was amazed at how different and tasty they were. I would not have tried some of the items if I would have known the menu before hand! Really enjoyed the experience. I also appreciate them for hiring blind people and giving them an opportunity to shine! I will definitely be back for more as its worth every penny

Nice food... great experience (no usage of mobile devices which is so much a part of our usual dining nowadays). Dining in total darkness relying mainly your feel and taste bud. Conversation involves mainly exchanging of each other guess of the food and some coordination such as where to start and where are oir cutleries. Food is good and we are served by a very nice gentleman who ensures we are comfy throughout the meal. Well, You will get to know what you ate after the meal. :
4
Unusual dining experience; gets you on a different form of communication and coordination with your friends. It can be quite daunting at first (pitch dark);you may wonder if you would break the wine glass, leave the food unfinished etc, but no worries, you will do fine. Food is pretty good; they will show you photos of the food after you're done. Just so you know, they will not show photos of your dont-know-if-your-eyes-are-open pictures. It is so dark that you have no idea if your eyes are open.. really. Just try it. :
5
My friends brought me here for my birthday surprise and it was great. Service was good where we got to chill and have drinks/appetiser at the lounge before proceeding upstairs for the mains. Staff were friendly and professional. I initially thought I wouldn't enjoy not being able to see what I was eating but I was proven wrong as I really enjoyed tasting every single dish and focusing on both deciphering them as well as enjoying the variety of flavours that each dish gave. There wasn't any dish that was nasty or bad tasting and there were some that really stood out for me. I liked the fact that after dinner and dessert, we would go back to the lounge to fill up a quiz, where I could see if I was right with my guesses on what ate. The staff then showed us pictures and described to us the details of each course - only top quality ingredients were used! On the whole, I would say this is a must try for the entire experience. Dining in the dark also means no usage of mobile devices and social media - full focus on food and each other's company.

This was a rest experience. However the mixing of all the rich foods is not for me. Plus I quite like to see what I'm eating. The experience was good and glad I did it. But I wouldn't go again.
4
A unique insight into the world of blindness. Food quality was good, as was the service. It really was fascinating trying to guess the ingredients, and to experience the disorientation that comes with not being able to see. Very well done - the service was good too, both front of house and in the restaurant. The pre-dinner cocktails were excellent. If I were to be critical, I would highlight (1) the wine pairing, which I thought was overpriced for the quality and quantity of the wine served and didn't really add anything to the meal (next time I would avoid the wine); (2) portions were also slightly on the small side; (3) I was surprised coffee/tea wasn't offered at the end of the meal; and (4) the atmosphere in the restaurant was slightly spoiled by a very noisy table nearby - it would be good if the staff asked guests to keep their voices down, especially given the amplification of the other senses when you cannot see. Overall though, a great experience, and highly recommended
3
The idea behind this restaurant is great and the service is perfect. The restaurant is over priced though. Food was average, nothing special. Price too expensive. We spent for two persons almost 300SGD. We had three courses and two wine each
5
A novelty for sure. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - super friendly staff, including Rohmat our visually impaired water who was engaging and delightful guide in our experience. Four dishes at each course provided welcome variety and a chance to compare notes. We are both vegetarian and were very happy with what we had (both when eating it, and when it was revealed later). Would we do it again? Yes.

I cannot remember where was it that I heard about NOX, but it must have been a few years back. I do remember that this is a place where I must visit as I was extremely interested by the unique concept of dining in total darkness. So after years of procrastination, I finally made reservation online for 4 adults of course not without first checking out the prices which were quite clear on their website.Online reservation system was easy as breeze, and I was about to select the date, time preference, and list down if there's any particular comments or food preference I'd like the chef to know of. So I listed down nuggets of info such as no beef for two of my friends, non-spicy food for the ladies, and no raw food. Closer to date, I also received a follow up phone call to confirm my reservation and also to confirm the food preference which I've listed down during the online reservation. I love the follow up service.Before heading down to the restaurant, I did some quick reading on what to expect for this unique dining experience. I read that the service hosts were visually impaired/blind, the dining area is pitch black, diners are advised to wear flat shoes etc. A good point to note would probably be for diners to avoid wearing white. It helps for clumsy and messy eaters like me where I tend to drop bits and pieces of food. Hahaha!Upon reaching the restaurant which is prominently located, my group of friends and I were seated at the sofa lounge area where we can order some drinks and have a chit chat first. They also provide lockers and diners are advised to keep their belongings such as bags and mobile phones inside. The drinks menu includes cocktail, mocktail, reds, whites, beer, and also some non alcoholic drinks such as sodas, still and sparking water. Note that you can choose to have the drinks brought up with you when your turn comes to enjoy the dinner. They'll also take this opportunity to review our food preference again in case there's something that we missed out. I would say that's very attentive on their part. We were also briefed of the process and what to expect later. Ate an appetizer, chat for a little while more, and we're all good to go! Oh, you might want to head for the washroom before heading up to the second level for your meal, otherwise it's gonna be a bit of a hassle once you're up since you'll have to get your service host to navigate you through the complete darkness down to the ground floor where the washroom is located.Z was assigned to be our service host, we introduced ourselves and was asked to put our right hand on the shoulder of the person infront of us. Up we go, to the second level where the dining halls are located. I like that the stairway gradually transit your vision from low light to darkness so that you can at least have a little bit of chance to adjust your sight and mindset. When we got to the point of complete darkness, we had to rely on trust, we had to open our ears to really listen, our other senses heightened to compensate for the loss of sight. We could somehow feel that there's walls or pillars around, or something is close by while navigating our way up with Z leading us. He was very careful and attentive to give instructions and directions, like for example if we're going round a bend or we're approaching the curtain, he'll give us a heads up first.We could feel ourselves navigating through some tables, and of course we can hear chatterings from other happy diners as well. Finally we came to a stop where our table was located. We were then seated, and I like that Z greeted us and remembered us by our names. The fork and spoon were located on our right hand side, with an empty glass infront of our utensils. Z also explained again to us that when the dishes come, we'll work our way from the 6pm direction to the 9pm, followed by 12 and finally 3. It's basically a clockwise direction.While waiting for our food, beside the sound of chatterings from the diners, I could hear sounds of whistling, shushing etc which I supposed are ways of how the service hosts communicate with each other. Looking up at the ceiling, I also saw a few tiny red colored lights which I believe must be the infrared cameras. I like how the restaurant are responsible to also install cameras in case of safety issues. My friend also asked a very funny question - whether to have our eyes closed or open throughout the experience, and also joked about how this would be the perfect place for a blind date (pun intended).Our first dish came, Z would call out our names individually and make known that he's coming around to serve our food so our reaction was to keep still in case we knock into the plates or cause him to knock into us. The food were all delicious!!! We had a lot of fun trying to guess the food and commenting to each other which were our favorite dishes! There was one point where Z dropped one of the dishes after clearing our plates and almost instantly we heard another voice from another service host coming around to help clear up. Z and colleague also apologized profusely but we were totally fine with that! We didn't and never expected any perfect service as it is human to err, and since Z was relatively new on the job, we thought he had already performed really well while servicing us! That bit of mistake I had to mention here not because he made a mistake, but because I realized that this dining experience taught me something important - patience, gratefulness and empathy. I hope other diners will get to experience this and have this aspect of their "senses" amplified as well. Diners are also "forced" to "quit" the mobile phone and to make real connection/conversation with each other. Living in this fast paced society, some of us are already numbed, lost the empathy and some even take things such as eyesight for granted. This will be a good experience. I guess that's the biggest gain we got out of this dinner, besides the excellent food and service.Z would also attempt to make small talks with us, asking us how's our food, and if there's anything he can help us feedback to the kitchen if the taste is not to our liking etc. He'd also check in with us to see if we have finished our food, just in case we were done and waiting for the next course to be served. The desserts were simply delicious! I have no words to describe but only remembered my eagerness to know what food did we eat! So when we were done, Z led us down to the ground floor again where we had to fill in some questionnaire forms. Some questions include things like what's our favorite dish, whether are we able to identify the ingredients etc. One honest feedback is the serving portion of the food, which we wished were bigger. Hahahaha. Well, couldn't help it that the food was too yummy and we hoped we could have more. And we also understand that they actually change their menu every few months, and with that we definitely hope to be back again the next time! Probably with different group of friends and even family members. Will be fun! In all it was a unique dining experience, one of a kind in Singapore, and we would like to wish all the service host the best of health and happiness in all the days of their lives. Cheers! (

My friends and I (group of 5) had a celebration here and it was all-new different experience. We were briefed before that and led to a completely dark corridor (with stairs!), and then into a dining room. The dine in the dark concept was something that most of us would have little to none experience with. Hence, it was a good time for us to get in touch with our senses. Also, we had to put our trust on the person who was leading us to our seatings, and listen to the instructions (i.e. there's a wall in front, turn right etc). Communication with each other was important and we can only identify each other's seated position from the direction of the voice. We also chat with the server who was serving us, and got to know how he coped with his handicap. Despite of this, he never gave up and continued to self-improve. The price per pax was slightly on the higher end, but we felt that it's totally worth it, because such experience gave you a light of how you "see things" from different angles

Amazing experience. You have to use your sense of taste and smell to enjoy the food you are served, the taste of food get enhanced when you try different dishes. There are 3 courses consisting of 4 starters, 4 main courses and 4 different desserts. Every dish tastes different and is delight to have. Must have experience. Only advice to owners is to changes the menu more frequently. Currently they change menu after 6-8 weeks.

This was our first experience of dining in the dark and we were very impressed by the experience. The food was also very unique in taste. We had thought that we got the dishes. But the actual ingredients proved to be pretty much different from what we had guessed. Hence the chef actually did a good job with the menu. A must experience
5
We have been wanting to try dining in the dark for a few years now and we were not disappointed. We were greeted by very welcoming staff and they explained how dinner was going to work. We were then offered a pre dinner drink and we chose to have 3 glasses of wine each with dinner all chosen by the chef to complement the meals (as we of course didn't know what we would be eating!We were then introduced to our visually impaired waiter who lead us single file up the dark stairs to the restaurant. The whole thing was very strange to begin with. It really is totally dark, you cannot see your hand in front of your face but you get used to it quite quickly.Dinner was very tasty and they accommodated my no fish request happily. We really enjoyed guessing what we were eating and then after the meal we were shown what it was and we could see what we guessed right and wrong. Totally enjoyed the whole evening and we definitely would recommend it to anyone

Its interesting experience where you dine in the dark, you will need to use more of your other senses and it makes you value your eyes more. However, i'm disappointed in the food portion for the price we pay

My husband and i went to Nox because we wanted the experience of dining in the dark. The manager, Jose, greeted us at the entrance and spent time with us in the lounge. He's a great guy: friendly, personable, and knowledgable. He recommended two cocktails to start and explained how the restaurant works. All of the waiters are either blind or visually impaired. Before you head upstairs to the dining rooms, of which there are four, you must place your purse, watches, phones, and anything that could be a light source, reflector, or glowing into a locker and lock it up, taking the key with you. Your waiter/host you meet and greet by name and handshake and then he leads you up the stairs to the dining areas. This was the scariest part for me because I wore high heels and realized that was not ideal for navigating the pitch black stairwell. Hafiz went first with my hands on his shoulders, and my husband trailed me with his had on my shoulders. The table was sized for two persons and I felt the napkin in the center, the utensils to my right, along with an empty water glass. Hafiz handed my left hand my wine glass after we were seated and I was surprised the glasses were stemmed. My husband joked then that the floor must be covered in spills by the end of the night. The dish of appetizers, entrees, and desserts--four small bowls for each course on a serving platter--are set in front of you course by course and the recommended way of eating is to start with the bowl at the 6pm location. The bowls feel like the ones used in Japanese cooking, and one was placed each at six, nine, twelve, and three as if on a clock. The appetizers were salads and seared meats/fish and I found it easier to determine if I ate everything by using my fingers as opposed to a fork. The entrees were eaten with a fork because they were hot and a bit "messier". For dessert I used a combination of utensils and fingers depending on the dessert. The wines paired with each course were very appropriate and complementary. Most of the talk throughout our meal was about what we were eating: spices and flavors, discussing what each food was, which bowl we were on, etc. Time flew fast as we felt like we were upstairs for 30 minutes and it was actually an hour and twenty minutes.After the meal you go back to the lit lounge and fill out a questionnaire guessing about what you ate, talking about your experiences. Then an employee shows you photos of what you actually ate and discusses everything with you. They were very accommodating with my need for a wheat-free meal. For that, I'm grateful. I'm also very thankful for this whole experience as it made me appreciate food very differently than i usually do and it gave me a better understanding of what it would be like to be blind. As we were leaving the restaurant, Jose walked us out and down the street to Arab Street and all of the shops and bars. He made recommendations where we could get an after dinner drink. The service at this restaurant is first rate. I would recommend this place for adults and responsible older kids or teenagers. It isn't a place I'd take young children to. Oh and some people on TripAdvisor and elsewhere have complained about the price of dining here. I believe it is $78 singaporean per person, with cocktails at S$20 and the three wine pairing at S$50. I would argue that fine dining and cocktails and wine in Singapore costs that if not more as that is what we spent almost everywhere we went on the island

It is very near Arab street and Haji Lane and it's easy to find. There were lots of good reviews about this restaurant and my friend was excited to try eating in the dark as she saw it in her favourite Korean show called Infinite Challenge. We had no idea of the price of the food but were informed a lot about the experience and were provided a menu of drinks. The waitress kept approaching us to ask whether we were ready to go upstairs to our table and we were served the appetizer (salmon in a small cone). Before we went to the second floor, the waitress introduced another waiter for us and we introduced each other's name, then he leaded us to upstairs. When the door was closing, we heard the wait staff laugh out loud by seeing us were screaming because of afraid of can't see anything. The table is super small. Food was cut to cubes or slices, so we could easily scoop it and eat it.However, we thought it was too oily or too strong for us and we couldn't finish the dishes (though they were in small bowls), especially the soup. After we adjust to the darkness, we felt very comfortable and relaxed. However, when you can't see anything, your hearing becomes very sensitive and the sound of other ppl talking is quite loud, there was a group of people celebrating birthday somemore! We trusted the waiter that the food is quite dry as he strongly suggested us to order drinks, but we found that the food contains a lot of source and even make us feel it was oily. By the way, I ordered the strawberry cocktail ($20) which was taste like sweet coughing drinking medicine. We were not satisfied with the service as the waiter could not stop coming by and asking us whether we had finished our dishes which made us quite panic and interrupted our conversation. When he placed the dishes, my friend's head was hit by the plates but he didn't notice so there was no apology to her!!! My friend's spoon dropped on the floor and he also didn't notice but he said he would sense it usually ( excuse me?) There also no points that we introduce our names to him as he won't call our names when come to our table to serve, so we sometimes just don't know whether he was talking to us or to the next table as his voice was so near, hence he always failed to get our responses or we just answered him when he was serving the table around us.The total bill was surprisingly around 225 for 2 pax as we didn't know about the price for the set of meal (2 cocktails and 2 set of food (4 small bowels of appetizer and 4 small bowls of main course, another 4 small bowels of desserts.)After we had finished the meal, we were led to downstairs to see what we have eaten just now. Generally speaking, the experience is unique but it's too pricey. My friend and me both think that trying this restaurant once in a lifetime is more than enough. We call it 黑店
5
The experience at NOX is something everyone must try atleast once in a lifetime. Your taste buds on high alert in the pitch dark room. The best part of this restaurant is you will not be judging the food laid out to you, you will be actually TASTING it. Food was great, service even better. Restaurant is very accommodating for all dietary needs
5
This was my first time to Nox! After hearing all the hype about this restaurant online, I decided to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday here!IT WAS PITCH DARK TOTALLY! We cannot see a single thing and we are not allowed to bring anything that have lights, e.g. hand-phones.There was a total of 13 dishes, including the welcome dish at the lounge in small bites!After the dinner, we are asked to fill a survey form on the food that we have ate. After which, a friendly waiter will reveal the food we have ate in image form to us! Senses of taste, hearing and touch were very crucial for this meal. Overall, it was definitely an unique and memorable experience for both of us and we would love to be back again as their dishes would change every 1.5 months. :

Visited this place with 2 other girlfriends. We were ushered to the waiting area/lounge and ordered our drinks and had our starters. Drinks menu include cocktails (SGD20), mocktails (SGD14), wines, soft drinks (SGD6) and still water. Shortly after, we were advised to place our belongings in the lockers provided once we are ready to start. Our waiter greeted us at the door to the dining area upstairs and we held onto the other person's shoulder as we walked up the stairs. WOW! It was complete darkness! Our waiter was very professional and polite. Food wise, I had the vegetarian menu and hence I have no comments on the normal menu which my 2 other friends had. I would say the food were flavorful but a tad on the saltish side, probably it was because we lost one of of senses (sight)? Overall it was an awesome experience - I would recommend everyone to check it out!
5
This is such unique and wonderful experience. It truly is pitch black in the dining room but this enhanced the experience. You find that you concentrate so much more on the taste, texture and smell of the food and you actually appreciate the subtleties of the flavour so much more when you are forced to focus on it.The food was also amazing and the cocktails as well. The service was prompt and attentive. The blind waiters were wonderful. We felt safe and comfortable the entire time.We had so much fun trying to figure out what we were eating. I feel like I will appreciate the flavour of my food so much more now.It's not cheap though, you wont get out for much less than $150 SD per person (that's with a drink or 2). But it is absolutely worth it. I would absolutely go again
5
Agree with many other reviewers, it is a new dining experience. Reminds me of the movie About Time, never occurs to me that there is the same dining concept here in Singapore. I look forward should they mimic the same date night for singles. In all, all is good for the price you pay
5
It was an amazing experience, from the time you step into the restaurant til you leave. From the lovely hosts, to the food, to the wonderful waiter that guided us along the way. It truly IS an eye opening (closing? pun intended) date night. Moreover, I felt that the entire idea for this, is for us normal humans to be in the shoes of those that are less fortunate who are unable to see, and they pretty much nailed it! :
1
I wish I read the not so positive reviews here before reserving, it sums up all our experience which makes me wonder - despite being very responsive to message they did not actually do much to improve the lows.We had booked for 8.30 but and the whole dining experience could be done in 45mins max but it took us two hours. Cocktails are okay and it was exciting stepping into the pitch dark but the excitement wore off pretty quickly. Food was just okay, bit boring, not complex in flavors or creativity or anything short of amazing so - yes for the price you pay you easily get better food (and better experience) anywhere else. The waiting time in-between courses were easily 30mins each time. We have mentioned to our server that we waited tad too long, that we have finished our appetizer for a while - but how frustrating when it happened again - too long gap from main to dessert and then again (!!) from finishing dessert till the server escorted us out. We think that it's very ignorant of them, they should have someone around to check from time to time. We called many times, it was quite helpless actually to finish eating and waited terribly long just to pay your meal and out. As a comparison, we were already waiting for mains when another table had just arrived but we were escorted out of the dining room together with this table in the end.Maybe they don't have enough visually impaired hosts but this waiting game really ruined the whole experience
5
We went as a couple and it was great to experience this. To add on- it's not just about the experience but the food served was luscious as well. The service was excellent and our host was very entertaining. The food along with their cocktail set is a little expensive but for me personally it was worth the whole experience.
5
From the moment we (me and my family) stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted by amazing hosts that could spoke very charmingly and knew how to settle us into the whole experience. Offering us rinks and slowly explaining to us the whole experience. If you are equipped with a heart for adventure and a curious mind, this is the restaurant for you. We REALLY dined in the dark. 0 light. It heightened our senses to the taste the feeling of the food that we were eating. I subscribed to their mailing list and they change their menu every month! So that you will never get bored and can keep going back for more. If you want to find out more you should really head down to their website and check out what Dining in the dark is all about and make a reservation way ahead of your holiday as they are in very high demand ;
5
The whole idea of dining in the dark made the food taste better. Arriving at NOX, we were greeted and shown to a waiting area where we had our first taste of a great appetiser. We were shown to our table by Jason and until today I'm still amazed that he knew where to walk even though it was pitch dark. I couldn't even see my hands in front of my face! The appetisers came and as mentioned, the excitement of tasting food without being able to look at it made the food even tastier. Mains was great, and the dessert was a great surprise. The overall experience was excellent and I highly recommend NOX as a not-to-be-missed experience. Fair warning to couples: DO NOT surprise your partner with this dinner as preparation is needed to be able to face the situation. When we were there, 2 couples backed out because the other partner couldn't handle the dark. Lastly, thanks NOX for a great experience. Would definitely look forward to trying this again
5
It is an amazing experience. The food tho was not amazing. Good food but not great. Maybe it's because of the lacking visuals I don't know but it's very different. The service is top, and they welcome you afterwards with a guess quiz of your food. Funny to see
5
What an amazing experience !! Once you enter the stairway, you are in the deepest dark... guided by your host, you are installed at your table, with some indications on where you glass is (wine/water) and your cutlery... then come the jokes with your friends, when you feel more confident (!) the food was really good, which is so important when all your attention is focused on it, and you take your guess each at a time - sometimes a familiar taste is so hard to name !A very nice and fun evening - and with great food !
4
Nice to see how blind people feel and to really understand them. You can't bring anything in there so there's no way that you can see anything. It's supposed to take around 2 hours but my family eats really quickly so it did not take us that long. I also didn't like everything so I wasn't really full but the rest of my family ate everything and felt pretty full. It was also good because everybody got a different flavor of ice cream in the end and we didn't know so it was a funny conversation afterward. It was also meant for couples because it get kind of romantic and everybody was quiet and whispering except us because we were very loud and everybody probably thought that we were annoying. It's expensive though so it seems more like a one time thing and not a every Sunday meal

This restaurant is a real interesting one to review because the two most important factors you normally consider are excellent, both the food and the service are exemplary. But this place is as much about the experience as the food. When they say dine in the dark they really really mean it, you cannot see your hand even if you touch your nose. The menu is fixed so when you arrive you can have a drink downstairs and a small appetizer while they explain the evening format to you.After a few minutes your are greeted by your visually impaired host and led to the upper level, half way up the stairs you are way more helpless than your host, all you can relay on is your hands on the shoulders of your friend I front of you as you are guided to your table. There are three courses, each with four dishes cut up bite size for you, use your napkin you will need it. It's not easy, all of a sudden your are even challenged by even the most simple tasks like pouring water for the table. But the strange thing is the darkness, I was expecting some things to be different, like heightened senses of taste, (it's much harder to guess all the flavors especially if you are not all following the same eating order for the dishes. But it was the conversation that struck me, it really made me think about how we communicate and how much we use sight as an essential tool for discussions, try it and you will see even with very close friends there are more silences then normal.Finally a word of caution, this experience is not for everyone, it can be very stressful for some
5
we had a date night during the cocktail week. We both absolutely loved the whole experience - cocktails (mixed by a very talented Slovak bartender), very tasty food and great variety of food, very nice staff. I would highly recommend this place. They change menu every 6 weeks, will definitely come back :
5
First off, the staff are wonderful. Both the hosts and the visually impaired who guide you through the pitch black restaurant made the entire experience even better. The food is great with curious combinations that are just a sensation on your tongue. You will have only an inkling of what you are having (if you're anything like me) which makes it all the more fun. Not only do you get to appreciate food from your server's perspective but life as well, which I think makes Nox incredible and worth going back to. Especially since they update the menu every month;
5
Amazing food with amazing cocktails, would highly recommend this to anybody visiting Singapore. I will be coming back on my next visit.
5
Such an amazing experience dining in the dark!! I walked out instantly wanting to do it all again!!! Couldn't recommend this enough!!!
4
Went for the very unique experience and had a memorable one. Excellent service and the food was good.
5
I would highly recommend for a special event. We loved the dining, cause no phones were allowed so it was just both of us talking to each other and no distractions. The experience is definitely a bucket list type.Food was really good, we got a vegetarian course meal. Would highly recommend for anniversaries and birthdays. Abit pricey so leave the kids home on this one. It's a one time experience so don't think would be going back any time soo
5
Dining in the dark (absolute darkness, in fact) gets you on tenterhooks on what actually goes into your mouth. You have to savor what you eat, then naturally dissect your tastes to identify the foods - it is not easy you'll realize!On another note, you experience how people with visual disabilities feel. the meal is not just about the eating anymore- you would go back with more than just foods in your tummy, but food for thought too
5
Had dinner here for my birthday as a surprise to me. It was fun somehow trying to guess what kind of food you put in your mouth, while trying to figure out the ingredients as you chew them little by little. Would definitely be back here next time
4
It was overall a superb experience. Everything was really pitch black, and it was extremely fun to guess your food based on your other senses. All the belongings were kept away, so no phones, no light, no distractions. The food was pricey, but generally of good quality. Service was good, staff was reassuring. Finally, great drinks at the bar downstairs too! Highly recommend it at least once in a lifetime
5
My son is a picky eater, which made me decided to bring him here to try out the food without knowing what he's eating. A very good experience. The service crews & manager were very friendly & passionate on their job. Food was good. It's was an awesome experience. We really enjoyed it.Wasn't able to take any photos for our dinner except the welcome appetisers & corktails... Price was rather steep as we ordered corktails before our dinner but nevertheless keep up the good work NOX! Quote BD2016 to get yourself or your love ones a free cake from the house...
5
I've been to a similar themed restaurant (blindekuh in Zurich) and loved the experience there!We first entered the bar area where we had aperitif and were briefed about the concept. We kept our belongings in a locker (they were not needed anyway!).We were then introduced to our server and brought upstairs. We were in total darkness and had fun trying to figure out the cutlery, etc.At the end of the course, we were brought downstairs where we were asked to guess what we ate and were really surprised at the results
5
Was greeted warmly upon entering the restaurant and verifying my reservation. Simple appetizer of caviar was served, which was really delicious. We were then led by a visually handicapped server to the 2nd level which was pitch dark. The server was very helpful in leading us to our seats and orientating us to feel our cutlery in the dark. Each course comprises four dishes. Each portion was just right. We had fun trying to taste and guess each ingredient. The dinner was filling finally. After we returned to the lounge, the staff showed photos of each dish and explained each dish to us. Top notch ingredients were used for each dish.Overall, this was a really pleasant dining experience as we became mindful of each bite and really appreciated the smell, texture and taste of each dish
5
The experience was totally humbling: that the restaurant staff - despite being blind, was able to move around unaided, yet serve us our meals AND drinks to earn their own keep. I salute all of you! It brings to mind many questions regarding daily living chores - eating, cleaning, moving around, socializing etc. And yet, a lot of able-bodied people continue to complain about the lack of this and that...A visit to NOX will create more awareness for those who have any form of disability - be it visual, hearing or physical. Let's be more gracious and compassionate to those around us as some are "silent" disabilities (like the hearing-impaired - you can't tell by looking). Let's count our blessings for what we have, not what we have not
5
I surprised my husband with a trip to Nox Dine in the Dark on a whim. He was a bit nervous when we arrived as he was wearing light coloured pants and worried about spilling on himself (he ended up okay)! We had a drink in the downstairs lounge first, and then were led upstairs with the other guests in a line, with your hand on the shoulder of the person in front of you to prevent falling as you walk into the total darkness. The service was amazing. The waitstaff, who are visually impaired, are experts and patient and so kind with all of our bumbling around and giggling. We did the wine pairing as well and were pleasantly surprised to not spill even a drop - as far as we knew.The food was really good. It's shocking how much you rely on sight when eating - we only scored about 80% on the menu overall when quizzed at the end.It really is pitch black save 2 small infrared lights in the corner. They don't help you see but give you a focal point to look at, which bothered me a bit.I would highly recommend this for anyone looking for a fun, unique dining experience with great service and great food
5
I have been there twice.Once with my girlfriend and once with her family.Both experiences have been amazing and everyone of us enjoyed it.Beware: It is total darkness in there, cant even see your own fingers
3
We took my in-laws to this restaurant where you dine in complete blackness. The wait staff are legally blind and I guess the purpose is to generate some empathy for the visually impaired. It was a very strange experience and certainly generated an appreciation for how much we gain from the visual presentation of food. Was challenging not knowing what you were eating, but fun. Ambience not so great, would have been nicer with music. Food reasonable. Good experience
5
We had the regular menu (it was approximately SGD70 with no drinks if Im not mistaken). We arrived at the scheduled time and had a cocktail at the bar. This is the only place you can take photos when you're there.When it's time to dine, we were advised to put our belongings in the locker, no phones, no purses etc. We were then escorted by our waiter (who's handicapped, he is blind) and he shared with us what to expect. We were seated on the second floor which was pitch black; we had to walk in holding each other's shoulders.And our waiter was amazing! He showed us how to feel for our glass, how to avoid spilling our food, how to eat the food presented in front of us. Remember to order booze coz we had such a good laugh as we could steal each other's food only to miss putting it in your mouth etc.The menu wasn't told to us before hand so we had to guess what they were and at the end of the meal, we compared our answers. I would highly recommend NOX for the great experience, it gives you a whole new perspective on life. While the food wasn't that amazing, the hospitality is top notch
5
Was greeted watmly and had the concept explained over a drink. Went upstairs and were given detailed instructions on table layout etc.The food arrived and was 4 small servings for each of 3 courses. To say it was delicious is not to exaggerate.The meal was filling and lovely. A little on the expensive side. But fid I say at the start, we went for the experience. Thanks to the staff at NOX for a lovely meal and an experience.
5
Tried the Valentine's Day menu at a whopping $288++ for a 3 course (12 dishes) this year. Super pricey, but the service, experience and food are all great. Upon arrival, you will be served a welcome drink while your guide prepares to take you upstairs. Belongings and other objects that emit light are to be kept in lockers. Our guide was very professional in explaining to us what to do and we were very assured to be under his care during the 1-1.5 hours we were in there. He serves about 3-4 tables at one time. The food served are all of very good quality and it tastes really good! We sat at a corner seat, and though it was completely dark at the other areas, I could see slight rays of light from the emergency exit. All in all, we had a really good experience! The menu changes every 3 months so you could keep going back to revisit the experience if you want to
5
I went to Nox for dinner with 2 friends and we had a wonderful time.The service is wonderful- from the briefing at the beginning right throughout dinner to the debrief at the very end.The food was great, a wonderful mix of textures, Flavours and ingredients. I enjoyed every dish!! I was surprised at how few I guessed correctly! Overall a wonderful concept and really fun night out
5
Taste the food in the dark. Service was perfect. They will change the menu every 3/4 months (not sure). Must try! Give at least a try even the price is slightly higher! Unbeatable experience
5
Great menu and pure deliciousness. I recommend going for the experience and service. NOX is a must in Singapor
5
It is certainly an experience dining at Nox.Once you have had a discussion about what will happen when you go to the dining area and have identified anything you are not able to eat and ordered drinks, if required , you proceed upstairs to the dining area which is in complete darkness.There are 3 courses and each course contains 4 different bowls , tapas style ,.You do not know what each bowl contains , it is up to you to use your taste buds to work it out.!!For us this turned out to be quite a challenge, we didn't do very well when asked to identify what we had eaten.Food was very good though and service spot on given it was completely dark.Menu changes on a regular basis and dining here really helps understand the challenges that visually impaired people have to overcome.Definitely recommend
5
Great experience, staff were very friendly and nice, vegetarian option very nice, no idea what you are eating but get shown photos of what you ate at the end
4
The experience was unique, interesting and unbelievable. The whole dining experience starts at their lounge below with an entrée, and an order of cocktail. The preparation of the guest for the darkness experience was adequate and the area to chill before going up is greatly appreciated. Although the lady taking our orders could have been more verse in what was available. I was having a bad migraine, hence trying to avoid alcohol. I tried to order a mocktail version of what was available on the menu (I read online that it was available, and later confirmed by our server who brought us up), but was those she do not think a non-alcoholic version was possible. Tired to find out more, I just go with it. The experience after being led up was crazy. Total darkness! Ability to feel was extremely important here, but the sever was very clear on the instructions. Assertive but friendly tone makes the whole experience a lot more enjoyable. Knowing what to do, and how to do it was important. Food wise, they had me guessing. We are pretty accurate in our guess, probably getting close to 8 out of the 12 dishes right. It was amazing, especially for those that we did not guess correctly. You never would have thought that ingredient could taste like that. So, if you are going... Have fun guessing. The only distraction was the night vision camera, which have a round of red leds on it. It was rather distracting in a total darkness environment. I think the experience will be different for everyone, and every reacts differently to the total darkness. I adapted quite fast, and was rather relax once inside. We are rather quiet, with the exception of discussing what food we are eating. However, we do enjoy the company of my other half in silence. That was nice. While there are others who are quite conversational in the dark (not us). Unique for everyone. Anyway, have fun in there. A little expensive, but worth the try. At least once, please
5
My husband took me to somewhere I'll never forget. ❤️ as we surrender our sight & dined in complete darkness without distractions from our mobile phones or whatsoever, we were given the opportunity to appreciate a gastronomical experience as we found ourselves completely immersed in the fun guessing what we were eating. I'm happy for the moments where we learn to appreciate communication, the importance of our sensory system that we take for granted & the humble service from Jason & Fabian - an attentive & friendly visually- impaired crew that made us feel comfortable in a totally unfamiliar surrounding. All in all, thank you for this truly memorable evening experience NOX -Dine in the Dark.
5
What a great experience this was!!! Amazing food and great service. Did not want to go when I was told where we wet re going as I was a little scared but glad I did. Restaurant is pitch black and cant even see your hand in front of you. The visually impaired staff are amazing and they made me feel very comfortable during my dinner. Will be going back with another group of friends as the experience was unbelievable. 10/10!
3
Probably because I went solo I really didn't find the advantage of dinning in the dark as favorable. But yes its pretty dark inside with a very faint light to barely see what you are eating. The ambience is extremely soft and romantic in a way. Food is okay. I would recommended NOX for those who want to spend some time with their romance partner
5
Wonderful food, incredible cocktails, and the best service in Singapore. I am clostrophobic and a fussy eater, and went into this really quite nervous. However, after being seated, and the food to started arrive, and the nerves settled it was a great experience. The food was magnificent, and I wound up eating, and loving, foods that I would never normally of chosen. Everyone should try this at least once!
5
I made a decision to celebrate my husband's birthday at NOX and the experience was mind blowing! Dining in complete darkness may seem intimidating at first but my husband and I really enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The food was exquisite and the service was excellent too. Fabian and Azhar did an amazing job and we were well taken care of throughout the dinner. In fact, we were not intimidated by the darkness at all and actually got used to it and was comfortable after a while... We even got through dinner without making too much of mess and was amazed by other senses that was greatly heightened. The experience was one of a kind and I would highly recommend to anyone who has the guts to give up their sense of sight for a couple of hours in exchange for an unforgettable experience.

The idea is a good one maybe a " once in a life time experience" but it failed to impress me. Put up to 60 people in a dark room, feed them 3 courses of degusation food and see what happens. I found the whole evening daunting, people bumped into me and whilst every one was very polite in apologising, I wouldn't do it again

Picture a totally blacked out room. food placed in front of you and all you have are your taste, smell and touch senses to identify your food. The food is exquisite. Having to identify texture and taste without sight, magnificent concept. If you are of the `eating with your eyes` fraternity. FORGET IT

I live in Melbourne and missed my Sister's Birthday and this was a belated celebration treat from me as I was in Singapore for the Chinese New Year Holidays. I have read a few reviews but still do not know what to expect and how its possible to eat in complete darkness. I am a clumsy klutz and everyone knows - my sister told me not to fall in the dark otherwise she'll not be able to find me. Long story short, i did not fall. But I did spill my mocktail. We tried calling our server a couple of times but we weren't sure if he couldn't hear us or were occupied with something else - so we left it. Although no one could see us it still felt pretty embarrassing (not in a bad way - we were laughing) as I think people could hear us pretty well. Other than the drinks - maybe there should be a side stand/column to put the glasses? I'm not sure if it happened to anyone else but spilling a $20 mocktail after just a sip is pretty disheartening... I think everything else is excellent. To summarise the process/experience:1. Upon arrival, you are seated at a waiting lounge and you can order drinks which is chargeable on top of dinner. 2. You are served free appetiser and the waiter will explain on how it will work in the dark room - we had crab lo hei (something along that line). Meals in the dark consist of 3 courses and 4 small dishes in each course placed in small bowls on a plate - you are meant to navigate from the closest bowl to you at 6 o'clock and navigate clockwise. They will also check with you regarding your dietary requirements as the menu is a mystery and you are meant to challenge your senses and tastebuds. 3. You are then invited to keep all your belongings in a locker including glow in the dark watches but they did not enforce it as the guy sitting beside us had one and we could see his hands moving around. ( it is a little bit annoying given that we wanted to experience complete darkness) 4. They give you the locker key - which has no strap or clip so if you don't have a pocket you have to make sure you keep it with you properly and not lose it. 5. You are to take your drinks and then led up the stairs and a visually impaired server will lead you to your table - you will be slow because you'll take time to get used to the darkness 6. You are seated and see nothing - so you have to feel the table carefully to put your drink in the right spot to prevent spilling it like i did. It was pitch black and a very unfamiliar sensation as i believe most of us are used to eating with lights on. 7. You are then served the food 3 times - 1 plate with 4 small bowls on it for each course. Enjoy the dinner slowly!! On hindsight, one of our mistake was because we couldn't see it we ate too quickly and its a pity as the food is really good and meant to be savoured. 8. The dinner was over in an hour for us - not sure about others. Then you are led back to the lounge to fill in a questionnaire on the food you've just had and you'll discover some surprises! Plus lose some trust as your tastebuds fail you. we swore we tasted banana in one of the ice cream and there was none. They'll show you pictures of how the food would have looked like as well. 9. Then you can pay the bill (ours came to about $250 for both of us) and are free to discuss your experience with the company you are with! Very interesting experience and tad pricey but it'll be worth it. Oh and they change the menu once in 2 months if you would like to repeat the experience with a different menu
5
It's a new experience to eat without having a clue what's in front of you. Trying to identify flavours and textures without seeing it.It's a very fun experience and I would definitely recommend.And believe it or not you can actually miss your own mouth ^

Great dinning with friends. It was all unexpected and quite the sensory experience. Once you get used to the complete darkness, food experience was truly on a different level
5
we booked the entire place for an event. when we arrived, we had some drinks at the ground floor and were brought up to the dining area at the second floor. i didnt expect the place to be in total darkness, you cant see anything there. The food is nice and you really have to use your other sensory like taste, smell and touch. awesome experience and its once in a life time
4
food was prepared according to the chef's creation that day. you would have to specify beforehand what you don't eat, and it will be reconfirmed again before you start your meal. there were lockers provided to safekeep your belongings, and we waited at the lounge area after putting our belongings in the locker. A visually-impaired guy came and introduce himself to us and asked us to follow him while putting a hand on his shoulder. The rest of the experience was awesome. Service was good, the visually impaired waiter would come and check on us to make sure we are doing fine. it really allows you to use your other senses to taste the food.There were a few times where both of us would find that a food tasted so familiar..something we have eaten before and yet we couldn't name out the food immediately. took us a while to do so. This made us realise how often we chomp down our food and not really savouring its flavour and taste. it was a good experience, everyone should try
5
We attended Nox last night and we absolutely love it! The food was delivered to us in absolute darkness by blind waiter all experience was superb. Overall experience was different and interesting also the food was delicious so the best cocktail in Singapore! Must to go
5
After researching many places to eat in Singapore we decided to make our 'special night' a night at Nox. We've always wanted to dine in the dark and we weren't disappointed.This night out is an 'experience' in it's own and I can highly recommend. When we arrived we were seated in the bar area to wait for all the diners to arrive and to have a drink. There were loads of options on the menu but we settles with a strawberry mocktail which was delicious and a Chardonnay which was just as good.Once all the couples had arrived we were prepped with what to expect and introduced to our waited for the night.Without giving too much away, you are served meals based on your dietary requirements and get the opportunity to be waited on by someone with vision impairments.We found our waiter who's name escapes me but starts with R - was sensational. Upon meeting us he was quite reserved but as soon as we were in the dark we found he felt really comfortable and in his element. It's quite astounding to see how things from someone else's perspective.Don't hesitate if you are just visiting Singapore - find the money and go here
5
Dining in the dark is not only a novel experience, but I would say a meaningful one too. Your experience starts when you are led in by visually-handicapped wait staff who turn the tables on you - showing you exactly where to sit, and telling you what you should be doing when you can't see a thing. And when you are not busy with your mobile phones (because you're not allowed to use it), you take time to listen to your surroundings, and more importantly, pay attention to those you are dining with. It is for this reason, it's a great place for dates! You not only listen more, you learn to trust your other senses too - feeling for where your utensils are, or how to pour your own water. Food is served in courses and in small plates so you can eat systematically (and not have it all over the table). Food is excellent too, or perhaps your taste buds are heightened when you can't see. A great experience overall. A little bit pricey but worth the experience
4
Intriguing concept, excellent food! I have to confess, I initially felt incredibly disorientated in the dark (considering it was so dark I couldn't see my hand in front of my face). However, over the course of the meal, I was able to relax and began enjoying trying to decipher the different dishes placed in front of me. It was only when we went down that we got to see the menu - there were some real surprises there! Our visually impaired server Jason was an absolute star. He made us feel comfortable and at ease. NOX is a must-try. We stepped out feeling incredibly grateful for our sight.
4
If your thinking of dining here, well, then it for the novel experience of eating in the dark...and its worth it. On the food and service, i would rate it average and good respectively, but then again, you not there for the food are u?Worth a trip for a memorable experience in a world where its increasingly hard to find one
5
Wonderful experience at Nox. It all started at the lounge whereby you get to choose your drink. (Actually I suggest NOT to have a drink! HAHA. You will know why!)Then the guide (who is blind) will lead you up a flight of steps in total darkness. It was terrifying at first, but of course, after the guide explains to you this is their lives everyday, you will start to reflect and think. After being seated, they will serve your dishes in 3 courses. Each course has 4 mini dishes and you should eat from the top in a clockwise manner, in order for you to guess your food later on. I hate veggies, but I ate many things I wouldnt have eaten if I could have seen them! Must try at least once, but if your other half is really scared of the dark, then maybe not! HAH:
5
Once I found out this reservation had been made I actually began feeling quite anxious. I had no idea what to expect and to be honest even at night time I am never in complete darkness. I was proved wrong, the waiters were incredible and I left this restaurant feeling very different. The food here isnt brilliant, there are loads of better restaurants in terms of food but for a place like this its the experience that counts. I have read loads of comment the food was a rip off etc.. Sure, but would you want to eat a fine dining meal all beautifully presented if you couldn't see it? Highly reccomend
5
It was our anniversary and as part of our 'never before experience' tradition, my wife and I decided to dine at NOX ! Dining completely in pitch black, guessing the dishes you eat by mere taste and smell and with nothing to disturb, I must say it's indeed an unique experience and time well spent. ! It's amazing how the guys there work with such precision. !! They go an extra mile to make you super comfortable and get accustomed. The food too was delicious. They accommodated our request of serving vegetarian food. By the end of the 12 - course meal, one is too full. This is a wonderful package of great food and an amazing experience. !! Kudos to whoever came up with the idea, to feel the world of the people who can't see 
5
It's my birthday so I plunged for a treat with my sister. We are both curious and excited. You will be escorted upstairs with a blind waiter but relax they knew the place very well. At first I felt nauseous maybe because I can't see anything while walking, or I don't know. All the food is served in a small bowl so you can lift it while eating. Try to muster slowly and enjoy the taste of each served meal. After the meal you are escorted back to the lobby and asked to fillup a form with few questions about the food or guess the ingredients on your meal. Later they will show you the photo of the actual meal you are eating. We did guess some but most we don't. We felt so awkward about the guy who's checking our answers because he laughed at it. But maybe he just tried to be fun but I hope he will be subtle. Overall it was great
5
What an experience! Having 12-course meal in pitch black dining room! Kudos to our waiter Rahamad for the superb service. He is blind, but far better than those servers in most high-end restaurants here in SG- who pretend they don't see you at all. The food tastes good... the guessing game of what we were eating was actually fun. My fave - watercress salad with artichoke! I would normally not order this but I am surprised this one tastes good! This is a must try when you're here in SG
5
NOX Dine in the Dark was not only one of the best meals and experiences in Singapore but EVER! This place is absolutely fantastic. The food, bar service/drinks and the experience are all absolutely one-of-a-kind and a definite "must-do" when visiting Singapore. I was a little nervous about the whole idea of dining in complete darkness but once you get there the staff makes you feel super comfortable and they run through the whole thing with you so you know a little bit about what to expect. After 2 hours and 12 dishes, I was completely amazed! Everything about the whole experience, including the food, was absolutely outstanding! One of the coolest experiences ever and some of the best food- definitely worth it and would highly, highly recommend it to anyone
5
My first time "dine in the dark" so it was a very interesting experience, making you appreciate life more. What surprised me most was how great the food was. Very fine taste. Very interesting ingredients; the guessing game was lots of fun. It was pricy but worth it
5
Was excited to go there after some advises from friends.So went to NOX with some friends; what a fantastic experience! The service was great and the food was excellent. I will certainly visit the restaurant again and I recommend everyone to try at least once. You won't be disappointed
5
what a great unique experience!!! we really loved our evening here. the food was average, but it was much more about the experience than the food itself
5
Didn't expect the dining area to be in total darkness! We were taken up the stairs thAt was dimly lit by our guide for the day. Once we were brought to the room, we were stunned at how pitch black the place is. Nothing could be seen at all. Our guide was very patient and told us not to worry. He guided us to our table and ensured that we were seated safely. Food was served to us shortly. Appetizers, entrees and desserts all come in a set of four. We slowed down in our pace to be able to eat and enjoy. Took us about 2 hours to finish. Once we were done, we were brought down back to the bar. We were then given a short survey to guess what we had eaten. Pictures were shown to us. Enjoyable experience! Be sure not to take children along as the experience will be too scary for them. It added up to about $100 per pax including drinks. As much as I enjoy my experience with them, I would honestly say that one visit is enough. :
5
Nice atmosphere with very good staff. Food was good and overall experience really unforgetable.I recomment it as unusual experience in Singapore

This was the second time going for dinner at NOX and my first time writing a review for any restaurant. It is worth it however, because the experience that NOX have provided me and my girlfriend was absolutely top notch. I would be touching on 3 things in my review: (1) The Service, (2) The Experience and (3) The Food.(1) The ServiceWhat had really impressed my girlfriend and I was the service provided by the team at NOX. Right from the moment we entered the establishment, we were attended to by a pretty lady at the counter. She directed us to an unused table, patiently talking to us about the various drinks on offer. When we asked for recommendations however, she discarded the menu of standard drinks for personalised ones made by a very talented bartender. Another staff had also attended to us, explaining to us the process that would unfold after we proceed to the upper dining area for dinner. Despite being blind, our waiters were very capable in the dark, a hallmark of their familiarity with the darkness. They were patient and jovial at the same time, engaging in some light banter with us while helping us enjoy the full experience of dining in the dark. Service was prompt and the attention given was brilliant. At the end of the experience, we were brought down once more to the lounge area where we were introduced to all the different food we ate. The service staff were very accommodating to our various questions and request for pictures. You will be hard pressed to find a better quality of service here in Singapore. (2) The FoodThe food was of good value. For a $88++ meal, we have a great variety of dishes, including more expensive dishes such as escargot, foie gras, wagyu steak etc. We were pleasantly surprised at receiving such high quality ingredients cooked in a delicious manner, and thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. The sensation of taste was enhanced by the fact that our eyes were next to useless. We could only concentrate on the taste, and the taste was indeed amazing. It should be warned though, that the cocktails are not included in the price of $88++. However, I would recommend that you let the bartender fix you his own unique cocktail, for it is really appetising! Thomas, the bartender, is very passionate about his drinks, and his drinks are of great taste!(3) The ExperienceIt was a very romantic dinner for my girlfriend and I. The darkness made our conversations that much more intimate, as we are not glued to our phones for once and had to focus on each other. Our hands were interlocked throughout the whole experience and beyond. For the guys, this is the best place to be the hero that your girlfriends, spouses, wives envision you to be. For the girls, this is where the guys will be your support. If he is as equally scared as you, dump him (just kidding). It was extremely humbling to lose the sense of sight, but because of that our experience was so much richer for it.I would definitely be coming back to this place again. Good job NOX
5
Food - the food is great. honestly, there is nothing that i don't like. just that when you are eating in the dark,you tend to be slightly nervous and take big bites. so i suggest diners to stay calm (it can be tough) and try to take smaller bites so that you can enjoy your food better. Service - service is great as well. The person attending to us was Hafiz and I must say it was truly enjoyable listening to him share about his life with us. impeccable service.value - i will say..it is worthwhile paying 100 bucks for this meal considering you are served 12 dishes over 3 courses and it's a pretty good experience. i don't think i would go again for the food because i would much prefer to eat in a well-lit environment BUT I DO THINK everyone MUST visit this place once. I may go back for the cocktails though
5
It was first time for us to have a dinner in the dark !! It was a Xmas present from my daughter and we just really enjoy the great experience and fantastic dinner !!And we really realized that how much we had been spoiled by visual information , so our sences are totally dum . At first we had a nice drink and small appetizer at the entrance bar , and friendly staff explained us how we could dine in the totally darkness . The staffs who served us at upstairs are all fully blind or half blind . And after finished our dinner, we returned to down stairs and asked to answer a few qustion about our dinner. But honestly it was so hard to recognize what we ate !!In the end they showed us what we ate by photos. The food taste was soooooo yummy !! Totally first expeience in our life , and this made us open eyes more how important to use our sences ! We love to go back again !
5
Brought my boyfriend to NOX for dinner as I promised to surprise him. This is very exclusive place and experience in Singapore. It ended up with a lot of pleasure and enjoyment. I am sure I will keep inviting friends to NOX for dinner
5
I took my husband here as a surprise for his birthday. The experience was fantastic and the food was absolutely delicious. Eating in the dark meant that you focused more on the flavours, smells and texture of the food and it enhanced the dining experience. The food quality was excellent and the menu was creative. We had fun trying to guess what we had eaten and the waiters were excellent and very friendly. Highly recommended for a unique experience
5
Nice experience!At bar nice cocktails and at 2nd floor, where is restaurant, blind but perfect team with a lot of skills. They took care of us all the time without any fail! Perfect!Different and great place
5
This is my second time at NOX. From the minute we walked in we were welcomed warmly. Our server was kind and gave made us feel comfortable. We were laughing the entire time! The food was delightful and we were surprised with our answers at the end comparing with what was really served to us. I would definitely come back! A must-do for visitors

Given the excellent reviews, I had high expectations to this restaurant. However, in the end I left quite disappointed. At first, we only really got the table almost an hour after we had reserved it - meanwhile you're expected to wait in the reception area while drinking their cocktails, although I'm not really sure what we were waiting for. The dining experience is interesting and original, but for me that was just for the first 10-15 minutes. Given the price of the restaurant, I would have expected better food as well - although it was not bad, by all means. My biggest problem however was how cold the restaurant was. We tried to address the waiter about it, but we got no response when we called for him in the dining room - I suppose he was somewhere else. I know the waiter surely did his best, but a little "is everything alright?" at each table every now and then would be nice, especially for those who find it weird to be shouting across the room to a waiter they don't even know is there. When you've finished eating and come down again in the reception/bar, you're expected to fill in a questionnaire with feedback. Having the sheet delivered in a box, instead of directly back to the waiter, would probably help the restaurant getting even more constructive feedback. I'm sad to say this, but overall this was a very dissapointing experience for 150 SGD per head
5
This was the first dine in the dark experience I've had. Seemed like a strange concept, but thought we would give it a go. When you first arrive, you have drinks in a dimly lit lounge area. A staff member also gives you a run down of how it all works and gives us some tips on how to eat in the dark. The service staff were great and very friendly. The cocktail list has some interesting options. After a little bit of time we were taken into the dining room. Behind the door into pitch black, we are lead to our table by our blind waiter. Even getting to the table without hitting anyone or anything was impressive. By the sounds of it, there were clearly quite a few diners already in the room. Our waiter was great at placing and removing our dishes (and so quiet) that it was almost as though they were appearing and disappearing by magic. Eating was amazingly not messy. The food tasted great. And the guessing of ingredients was a lot of fun. My husband was also hilarious when attempting to top up my mineral water glass. Even after pouring liquid in about 4 times, it still was only about half full. After dinner, you are taken back to the dimly lit lounge area to complete a little questionnaire about what you thought was in the dishes you were served. Then we were shown exactly what we were served. We had some complete fails, some close guesses, and some spot on. Great experience. Definitely recommended
5
I booked this as a surprise for my husband and two teenage sons (one is very fussy) whilst staying in Singapore after a cruise. We had cocktails in the lounge first and the bar tender Tom was very entertaining and got the evening off to a great start, he even got out 5 shot glasses and poured all 4 of us and himself a shot of something which we all enjoyed! After we put all our watches and phones etc in a locker and met our waiter at the bottom of the stairs. We made a train with him in front and he took us on a speedy trip to our table which was fun. The food was a 3 course set menu most of it was very enjoyable although my only criticism was a couple of bits of rather fatty meat but all in all very fun and enjoyable. My fussier son really only enjoyed the pudding course! :) We also opted for the 3 glass wine option which was nice and its funny how you can always find your wine glass in the dark! After dinner the waiter talked to us about his disability and gave us a greater insight into life in the dark. We then went back down to the lounge and had coffees and were taken thought the list of the food we had eaten and we had done quite well with our guesses. It was a very enjoyable evening and one which we will always remember
4
Interesting experience. Food was great too! However would not recommend to those who have a lot of diet restrictions because they might repeat ur dishes in perhaps different sauces. I particularly enjoyed their foie gras and their desserts! I think due to them being short staffed we had to wait quite a while before being brought down. We had to wait for other couples who arrived later to finish their desserts before we were able to all leave together. I hoped they would have allowed patrons to leave once they are done so that the servers downstairs could explain one on one as to what dishes were being served instead of explaining as a group. Priced at 88++ per pax it's good for a one time experience! Doubt I will be returning anytime soon though.
5
Service was excellent and helpful. The idea of dining in the dark is amazing and executed very well. We really liked our waiter, who also told as about his life as a blind person because we were curious to know. The food and drinks were really expensive (circa 80 euros per person), but it was worth it for "once in a lifetime experience". The meal set had 12 different small dishes (4 appetizers, 4 main and 4 desserts)
5
This is my second time being at a Dine in the Dark restaurant. The first one was in KL, Malaysia. They were both AWESOME experience, whilst NOX stands out more because of the food quality. What else can I say, check it out yourself, the title says it all, you dine.in.the.dark. Because you can only rely on your taste buds, and because you can't play with your phone or do anything else, you are resorted to CONVERSATIONS and having a GOOD TIME and tasting GOOD FOOD. We managed to play 'scissors paper rock' in the dark. Yeap, go figure. The rest is your imagination. I'll be sure to be back again, very soon.... ;
5
Food was great up until the last course. Learned to enhance my sense of smell and taste during the meal and guessing what you are eating makes the dinning experience more fun
5
Have you ever wonder how is it like to be blind? Yes, if you had guessed it, our senses are actually enhanced. This is a very unique dining experience where you will be lead (by a blind captain) to a total darkness dining area for your course of meals. You will be surprised the blind captain and waiter can actually manoeuvre the pitch dark area much better than us. Dining in place where you cannot even see your own hands is a challenge. We are told to slowly figure out the size of our table & placement of cutlery using our sense of feel. When our food is served, we are advised to put the food near our mouth to eat, just in case it gets too messy. We totally do not know what was served to us and we had to use our sense of taste to guess what we actually ate. Under such dining atmosphere, the taste of the food is greatly enhance as we had fun trying to guess what we were eating. At the end of our meal, we are supposed to write down our guess for the dishes and we are shown the pictures of the food that was served to us.It was greatly an experience and would like to visit again
4
This is an extraordinary experience and almost unique. You eat the most delicious food in the pitch black. And when I say pitch black, I mean it. You don't have a clue what is on the menu, though can specify if you are a vegetarian or allergic. The restaurant will provide an excellent wine list, paired with the food, but if you prefer you can choose your own. When you first arrive you are offered a drink but no menu and encouraged to put your mobile phone etc in a locker. When you first enter the restaurant it's a very intense moment because you literally can not see a thing. For a moment I felt panicky but the waiters are all blind, and immediately put you at ease. You are told in advance how it works. Four small but utterly delicious bowls of food for starter, then main course, then pudding. All served over the course of an hour or two. The food is exceptionally delicious so don't be afraid and the main reason for this is two fold. The first is the appreciation of food, with the usual norms of life taken away. You see nothing, so the taste becomes a far more significant part of the process. You will be astonished how hard it is to name some of the food you eat. You know the taste so well but there are one or two tastes that may elude you. Secondly you genuinely appreciate what it is to be blind, and feel very privileged to know that experience, and understand more of it. And actually I now add a third advantage. Conversation. Without the usual distraction of modern day phones, people's faces all around you, the reaction of the people around you, is all strangely removed, you are far more alert to the person or people around you, and really hear what is being said. This is a fascinating and rather wonderful experience and recommended to anyone wanting something a bit different. The taste of that glorious food stays with you a long time, as does the experience
5
We had four main course4 deserts and 4 appetizersAll was good However the overall experience was beyond imaginationTo be all the time in the dark and you are served by a professional blind Waiter is just wowI recommend anyone who visit Singapore to try it Once in a life time activity
4
It was an unforgettable experience. The cocktails were delicious, as was the food (Christmas menu). We had fun guessing the ingredients. The service was excellent, and I felt enriched with the brief experience of the pitch darkness that visually-impaired persons live with daily. I would definitely recommend it
5
This was my favourite thing in Singapore! Such an interesting experience! Do try the strawberry fields cocktail it was out of this world! Could not fault the service or the food!
5
Delicious food and cocktails.
My friends and I loved the concept!
Recommend to try this, really nice and enjoyable experience!
5
The novel concept of eating in pitch darkness (yes, absolutely zero visibility from the beginning of your meal to the end) made for a very memorable experience. Having a meal without any visual distraction was very enjoyable. That alone is a good enough reason to visit this place. The food was excellent ! And the wine pairing suggestions were spot on. The menu changes regularly, but our meal had everything from sashimi, duck, lamb, chicken and pork. The dishes were a fusion of Japanese and European. Each course had 4 dishes in small bowls, making eating in absolute darkness easy. The restaurant can cater to special dietary requirements if need be provided they are informed in advance. The service (handled entirely by visually impaired waiters) was attentive, friendly and professional. The place is generally full, so advance bookings would be recommended.
4
It was quite unusual dining whilst not being able to see anything (literally pitch black, I couldn't even see my husband or utensils directly in front.) Relying on my other senses was strange but refreshing. The food was simply OK for me but because all the different flavors for each course was a bit overwhelming (each course has 4 different mini meals with its own distinct flavor.) If you're looking for a different dining experience, this is definitely it. What I totally loved were the Mocktails, tasty & refreshing. Not like most places where you feel like all you're drinking is sugar! The Passion fruit one is a must have
5
This experience can not be put into words...you all have to take the leap and try it.The food is amazing, the staff fantastic and you leave the restaurant knowing you were transported somewhere far far away, but cant describe it...for it was not of this world
5
This is indeed a great experience. The food is awesome too. And when we don't have to focus on the food and environment, we can actually appreciate more on the taste of food and enjoy the conversation with the people we dine with. Give it a try ;)
5
We took my in-laws to NOX on their last night in Singapore as we were looking to do something the would remember & was a bit different to the usual spots. It was a huge success with my in-laws.We had a fantastic meal, all the dishes were tasty, our waiter was had a great sense of humour & made our experience one to remember. My husband & I are looking forward to taking some friends there in January!Thanks team NOX for a night everyone will remember!! 
5
I have been to Nox 4 times and it seems to just get better. It is very difficult to write a review when they are in mid-menu, so all I can say is go, enjoy he experience and the food. Oh, do the wine pairing too, it was great
3
This was to be a surprise of sorts for my partner who cooks alot.Unfortunately the foods presented were all really common - meaning that if say..they served Mac & Cheese, it was just that. Mac & Cheese. No innovation. The fish was also slightly overcooked. Needless to say, le Partner was not amazed, and neither was i. It was like tasting a dish and knowing what it was. We didn't get the ratatouille moment we expected. While the photos of the meal looked really good, I'm pretty sure that's not what we ate. There was definitely less sauce, probably to keep the place neat. Unfortunately I do depend alot on sauce..Furthermore, the food seemed 70% similar to what miss tamchiak described in her 2013 experience....even though the team said they refresh the menu every month.So while the food was overall reasonably good in that I ate it all, i'm not sure how I ended up spending the price of a pair of air tickets to Vietnam on such food...I sure hope that the premium prices went to paying their service crew well, because that's where the restaurant really shines. Service was impeccable and warm, and helped salvage the night.Come here for the experience, I'd say. For the fun in eating in the dark with a good friend, and to try to experience what it means to be visually impaired, so you can ruminate on it later on and treasure what you've got.Just...don't come expecting to be amazed by the food...sorry!

Upon stepping into NOX, I actually felt slightly nervous not knowing what to expect. However, the staff made me feel comfortable throughout the whole dining experience. It has made me realize the value of trust (the assurance that the staff will lead you to your seats without causing any accidents) and the appreciation for all of my five senses ( by not taking our senses for granted. Also, not judging the food wholly by sight to determine how the dishes will taste like. In addition, I have to compliment the concept of the restaurant for giving an opportunity to create jobs for people with disabilities.Blind tasting was really exciting, because you may just discover what you might end up liking at the end of each course. For a true experience, it helps that the menu is changed in 4-6 weeks. I was told that Christmas menu will be coming up next! Definitely recommended for the adventurous souls!Being detached from technology was definitely not something I am used to, but it allowed my partner and I to have a conversation throughout our meals and discuss about food as we went through each course.The only negative feedback would be the noise contribution from a big group of diners, which did affect the whole experience but we were lucky to have finished our meals by then.Overall, I will definitely recommend anyone to give this restaurant a shot! Value for money; a novel dining experience backed by great service

For those that have a fear of the dark, please do not go. The concept of this restaurant is that they serve a few courses (and there will be multiple dishes for each course served together in little compartments/bowls) in total darkness (like seriously pitch black) and they have visually handicapped servers, so you will get to experience what they experience day in, day out. I especially love the fact that they make it a point to hire the visually handicapped instead of just hiring some people and make them put on night goggles. Your other senses are heightened with this pitch darkness, and they do not tell you what you are served, instead you have to depend on your other senses besides sight to figure it out (they do reveal it in the end when you are led back out to the lit waiting area, but most likely you would have forgotten your guesses by then). There are lockers (free) which they will request for you to keep your belongings, and they make sure that you get rid of your watches with glow in the dark clock faces or any other glow in dark stuff. I do wonder what they can do with glow in the dark nail polish..hmm....The cost is pretty high, almost a hundred per pax. But given its concept, I am more than happy to part with this money, rather than in some posh restaurant. The food is decent, both flavour and portion wise. If you have food allergies, you can let them know ahead when you make the reservation so that they can prepare accordingly.You can hear a lot of people talking and the room feels huge. We were amazed how our server could actually navigate and not knock things over - we were already making huge efforts to ensure we don't topple our glasses of water or poke our food into other parts of our faces. Makes you appreciate what you have - your sight - more.I do think this place is more appropriate for couples though, as I would expect it to be really hard to interact in a big group, although we did hear a big group in our vicinity. Firstly, you might not be able to hear each other on each end so you end up raising your voice higher than normal since your sense of distance is already skewed. And then everyone in the room can hear you talk. A smaller group or just a couple would provide that level of intimacy that I think this concept pushes for too

The Service & Concept is Fantastic, but not sure if Dining in the Dark is for everyone. While it is a unique experience it could make you a little uncomfortable and claustrophobic. If you don't like experimenting with food this place is not for you. I went with 2 vegetarians and both of them didn't like the food at all, I thought mine was average. It's certainly worth a try and like many others you may love it, unfortunately I don't think any of us would go back. Was a good one time experience, I think it may be more fun in a bigger group to
4
It is a very interesting experience putting yourself in a totally black atmosphere. You don't see anything but you are accompanied the whole way so that it is not stressful.The food is fine, tastes are great, varied and ingredients are very good quality. Even if we don't see, we understand it is still well prepared with lots of attention.The quantity is not big but you can taste many different things that are served in small bowls. The service is a bit fast so that you don't stay for too long - would have appreciated longer pause between meals
5
This was the first time my boyfriend and I had tried this and it was such a great experience! The food was delicious, I don't think there was anything we didn't like! and it was really fun guessing what we were eating. Our server was amazing, guiding us through the dark to our table and was friendly, helpful and funny throughout the evening. Had a cocktail in the lounge before we went through for the meal and the bartender was really friendly and informative and the cocktails were spot on. Would definitely recommend trying this!
4
Dining in the dark was a novel and interesting experience. It heightens the other senses, and it was a delight trying to guess what we were eating. It was also eye opening to appreciate just a little what living without sight would feel like. Would definitely recommend trying it! It's especially a nice thing to do on a date. The food was also pretty good and the service was attentive. A really enjoyable night out
5
One of the best meals I have had in years, great concept, amazing cocktails and incredibly moving experience. Loved it and would recommend for dates or groups
4
Unique dining experience with quite good food. It was an eye opener for many of us as we had to dine in complete darkness. It is located at the shop-houses opposite 'Parkroyal on Beach Road' - about 10 mins walk from Bugis or Nicoll Highway MRT station. However, the service staff for drinks / at waiting hall is rather slow but excellent service staff during the dining experience
5
Its an eye opener...there was nervousness. It brings you to a whole different world of darkness and how to enjoy it! Whereby you have to use your other senses and also I must say, we get to communicate even more and focus on each other plus the food
5
This place offer one of the more unique experiences I have had. You dine in the complete darkness and you don't know before hand what you are going to be served more than it will be modern European food and a total of 12 dishes. The food was great, but what really stood out was the service from the visually impaired waiters in the dark. They were as good as normal waiters, if not even better to be honest. Go and experience for yourself
5
Always been open to try new things in life and didn't hesitate to try Nox when I heard about it. Glad I didn't. It's located near Kampong Glam in a nicely renovated old shophouse. There is a bar on the first floor in the lounge area where you can try some cool cocktails before heading for the dark dining on the second floor. Don't want to spoil the experience too much, but you won't be disappointed. They serve good quality food in an environment that is like no other. Make sure you talk to the waiters to hear their stories
5
The staff look professional and welcoming. At first, I was wondering how are they going to serve in complete darkness but was not surprised when we were briefed that the service staff in the dining area are visually-handicapped as it is such a great idea to let them work in an area where everyone is equally visually challenged. It is heart-warming to think that they have a place they belong to and are able to perform better than any of us at their job. It is soothing and calming to dine in complete darkness once in awhile, I felt very relaxed. Also, it makes you taste your food carefully, to feel the texture and ingredients to know what you're eating instead of relying on your sight. It had been a wonderful experience, thank you NOX team
4
Great sensorial experience that everyone should try, not only to appreciate the food and the novelty, but to feel what it is like to be visually challenged. The food was good, the service was excellent and the wine paired was also highly acceptable. All in all a highly-recommended venue for couples or even big groups. Definitely good fun
5
Both my husband and I truly enjoyed our time and experience at NOX. Service staff, though visually challenged, are wonderful and we are especially thankful to Jason who has helped make our experience memorable with his dedicated service. Indeed a remarkable socially responsible enterprise that created equal opportunities to the less fortunate and delighting customers with every aspect of the experience. Highly recommended for those seeking an unique experience

Great experience and service by the wait staff. Nothing went wrong but the welcoming team at the lounge could be warmer

First of all, you get to tell your blind friends after the dinner, "hey, I know how you feel."Food is good. Concept is brilliant. It is a once in a lifetime experience.Comes in small portion that allows the darkness to silent off all senses but the taste buds. I could almost tell what was that beef steak was doing before it entered the slaughter house, if the next table across the hall wasn't excreting verbal waste and laughing out loudly after spilling her drinks.The dining experience had taught us that humans are generally afraid of the dark and would increase his/her speech volume to cover up for his/her insecurity.All wait staff on the dining floor are visually impaired. Jason, our server was excellent in leading us with confidence and wits to convince us that we were in good hands. He and the delicious food being served to us were the best part of the whole dinner.Menu changes every month I heard.After the dinner, we felt we had been back to school and were rather drained from the sudden surge in concentration during dinner. A good after dinner cocktail would be a good finale, but we were chucked with a survey paper and had to wait for a good 10 minutes or so and a birthday cake for the service staff to come show to a group of 10 of us through an iPad in her hand on what had been served to us.The dinner was $88++. Drinks not inclusive. I asked for water near the end of the dinner, I was told they serve stilled and was offered a bottle. I poured a glass (in the dark and I was very impressed myself) and never get to see that bottle again. I was charged $8++ for that virtual bottle of stilled water.When I made the reservation, I had mentioned that it was our anniversary. Dinner cost me $240 for 2 persons. 4 girls taking the after dinner survey got a birthday cake. Maybe they bought it themselves. But I got charged $8 for a glass of lousy water. Maybe I was petty...I didn't feel good. And I still don't feel better.I don't need a diamond ring. But if someone could come up and say, "would you like an anniversary photo together?"That will be adequate. It's that simple sometimes...I would advise ladies not to wear heels to the restaurant. You may end up breaking your ankles in the dark. Don't bother about dressing up too much. Dinner ambiance is complete darkness. Absolutely no one is going to see anything.Don't bother about bring a date to sweet talk over dinner. It's going to be so noisy and loud, you have to lean very forward to be able to hear each other.To be fair, the food was good. The server's attitude was excellent. Dinner was not impressive.Like I said, it's a once in a lifetime experience. I would encourage my friends to try if they could afford. Funnily after the dinner, 2 of us were wondering if we had just finished dinner, or attended a lecture on The Way of Life of the Visually Impaired, because the whole while that note was being emphasized.Unique, it is. ha
5
The restaurant has been open ore than 2years, but for some reason we never heard of it till recently. It's busy on most days, so make a reservation to avoid disappointment.The service was great from time of reservation till the revelation of the actual food we had during our meal (it's really tough to guess what you are eating).The food was well balanced and the che is really talented. We will come back for more in the near future
5
What an experience. Arrived at the lounge, ordered couple of the signature cocktails and they were good! One of the lounge staff explained in detail what to expect during dark dining experience which put us at ease. There are a total 12 dishes (4 starters, 4 mains , 4 desserts). It was fun and interesting to try various dishes. trying to figure what it is. The hosts at the dining area are visually impaired and were a great inspiration
4
Fantastic experience! The food was good, not brilliant but the experience of dining in the dark more than made up for this. Cocktails were interesting and tasty
4
A must do minimum once in your live. It feels very strange and good at the same time and trust me it's really totally dark.Food and service is ok, maybe a little on the high price but than you can't do this everywhere. We very much enjoyed our selfs
2
Interesting experience, but not a pleasant one in my opinion. The food was average for it`s price. They really ask before you enter about any food you don`t like, but how can one imagine they would serve pig`s ears!
5
Service was incredible. Staff were so sincere & genuine & really completed the entire experience for us

After several of our friends had visited Nox, we decided to go during our recent trip to Singapore. We we were not disappointed. I laughed when we arrived as the welcome area is a bit disjointed and not at all pretty, but then I realized that there really was no reason to make the area colorful and flashy. I also enjoy the concept of co-ed toilets. We enjoyed our drinks and my daughter enjoyed watching the bar tender. Then we were ready for dinner.Fabian met us at the bottom of the stairs and took us to our table. My wife and daughter were laughing wondering how anyone could navigate the trip with high heels. We found our table just fine and figured out where our cutlery and drinks were. Then the fun began.We totally enjoyed the 3 courses. Was it the best food ever? Certainly not. However, combine the various flavors and textures and eating in the dark and the result is a fantastic dinner. There is not a lot of small talk or sitting around the table so the meal is fairly quick. We were there longer than some and were still finished in 1.5 hours. The staff is fantastic and the experience is like nothing we had ever had. We will definitely go again when we return to Singapore and bring friends. Thank you Fabian for everything. You are certainly a gentleman and a fantastic waiter. We have a wonderful night, thanks to all

I was here with my partner to celebrate our 7th anniversary. We both loved the food very much and were able to guess the food correctly! Initially, when we heard there were 12 dishes, we had thought it was definitely a small portion. When the food came, it also "felt" like it was a small portion. But what I got to say is that, the "small" portions are actually filling! What is even more awesome is the experience of using other senses to enjoy a meal. Definitely enjoyed the dine in the dark experience because it also allowed me to sit back and think through not to take anything in life for granted.And the icing on the cake has got to be the great service by the friendly staff! Kudos to Rahamat and Jason! We would definitely recommend this experience to everyone. Dining in the dark (instead of dim lighting) is the new romantic
5
Not sure what more I can say that hasn't already been said? You certainly come here for the experience, and I can say that we had a wonderful time giggling in the dark and listening in to what other people made of the whole thing. Our waiter, Jason was wonderful and incredibly on top of things. The servers come out of nowhere like ninjas and see to it that you are enjoying your food and that everything is in order. The food was superb, and the drinks were excellent! If only I could order a few of my favourite dishes that I was served a la carte, I would in a heartbeat.Will definitely be returning again with friends and family in tow

During my visit to Singapore, I had dinner with husband here to celebrate my birthday. I loved the concept- dining in darkness, escorted and served by blind waiters, and most of all guessing what you are eating through smell and taste. We were served bite-sized dish of the day in the lobby where we ordered drinks. Our waiter then escorted to the upper floor which was pitch black. Their menu keeps changing regularly. The entrÃ©e and main course was overall average I would say - some really nice dishes while some were average. The desserts were quite good. A place you should definitely try out once. Nice place to go on a date but yes it's expensive!! I totally loved the mini cake my husband ordered which was a mix of mouse and tiramisu and just melted in my mouth. Delicious
5
While on a week long work conference my brother had planned some culinary experiences in the evening for us to sit back and relax. Nox dining in the dark was one of them that had me intrigued at the beginning and forever talking about it way after I left the restaurant. The amazing food sent my senses crazy minus the sight as we were eating in pitch black! It's interesting how when we don't see what we eat our other senses of taste and smell just kicks in overdrive... I highly recommend this place if you're looking for fine dining with a twist and walking away not just with yummy food in your stomach but a warm admiration in your heart for those who are vision impaired. The service from these guys are 5 stars and their happy voices along with singing makes it even less daunting when you're sitting in complete darkness. Give it a go and you'll be very surprised that having the inner peace, no judgement only stillness, no iPhones but only talking to your loved ones about what you are eating or rather try to guess what it is can be so fun and rewarding!!
5
My boyfriend took me here for my birthday and I have to say it was great! The experience is very unique. You can not see anything and it is a little stressful because you are eating and there are so many things to worry about, cutlery, water glasses, wine glasses, ect... but then the food comes and you are just like blown away! It is so fun to try and guess what you are eating and it all tastes so good. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a little adventurous and definitely get the wine pairing. It is expensive but I think as a special occasion it is worth it
4
We went there for special event and the dining experience is pretty good. The dishes are quite nice and it really gives you an taste of how blind people live their lives -- which is one of the purpose of the restaurant based on my understanding. However there are quite a number of dishes are too fat -- the duck as well as the roast pork. But the service is great. There were a big group dinning at the same time and the restaurant informed us in advance. The only problem is the price -- the alcohol drink is 20+ per cup and the food is a set meal. Eventually we spend 266 for two persons and we only had one drink... It is really for special occasion I guess..
4
Went there for my birthday celebration with a party of 12 - ended up being the birthday dinner with the least pictures ever taken..!Wouldn't go if you're a picky eater! The food was fusion and it was tasty; I enjoyed the desserts the most. The mains had heavy and fatty sauces and couldn't finish them all. At the end you will be asked to guess the food, was interesting to see how the girls guessed most of it while the guys were completely off!It's a truly intimate experience and I'm glad I went with my close friends. Our waiter was truly amazing and did everything to make us enjoy the experience, but I was honestly terrified by how pitch dark it was. I started to feel sad thinking of a sightless world... I also wished they would have asked me on the seating before going to the dark room so that I could have advised them on how to place us
4
This is how the concept works the moment you stepped into NOX. The service crew will also present you a lanyard and some-sort of the carabiner to hook the locker keys, where you will be told to lock any light-emitting devices as well. NOX's does not have a menu, where you get to decide what you would like to eat. Every course you have, will be a surprise from the start of the course till the end of the course. Our sense of hearing seems to be more sensitive than before, amazingly. Very good
4
We booked this dining experience as our " Special Dinner" while on a 3 day stop over in Singapore. And weren't disappointed. It's not a cheap night but we thought it was well worth the money spent. The waiters who are visually impaired are amazing, as it's a bit freaky when you can't see a thing. The food we found all delicious , and we were quite surprised when we were shown the photos afterwards of the food we ate. We choose to have the 3 matching wines. If I was to do it again I would prob only do 2 as it was just a bit rushed to drink the 3. The wines were lovely. This is an experience I think everyone should put on their buckets list
5
The most awesome dining experience you'll ever have! I went for my 25th birthday dinner as something unique and its all I raved about when I got home! Its just so different from any other restaurant I've been to! Ill never forgot it
5
Took my girlfriend for her birthday whilst we were on holiday in Singapore. Had always wanted to try this and it did not disappoint! All staff were fantastic and helpful. Our waiter was always on hand if we needed anything (getting to the loo!). A variety of food is served in 3 courses with 4 dishes in each course and eating in the dark (pitch black by the way) really does boost your taste. Afterwards you sit down wit hat member of the team and discuss what you ate - some surprises to what you think but nothing disgusting! Overall a great albeit surreal experience which I can't wait to do again
5
This restaurant is out of the others. Impeccable service that made my dining experience a flawless, nothing to fault about them. The waiters, although can't see, are always cheerful and are not afraid to share about themselves, when asked about their lives eg how they cope up with work etc. This dining experience made me appreciate my sense of sight. The food is superb as well. Forget about romantic candlelight dinners! Go for this experience and you'll feel its a superb different experience. Tell them in advance if you have special dietary requirements and they are able to advise you and their kitchen accordingly
5
The concept is very interesting because you are not biased by the looks and hence your anticipation of the taste. It is honestly pitch black in the restaurant and you literally do not see the hand in front of your eyes.After a cocktail in the lit up bar the waiter picked us up and took us upstairs polonaise-style. He explained what is where on table, placed a bottle of water in the center and told me to pour myself - i thought he was joking but he wasn't! I worked and we did manage to not spill anything. I do not want to spoil the experience so I am not going to tell more details - go try it yourself. It is truly an amazing experience. The food itself tasted very good and the meat we had was of very high quality. Very nice is the session at the end when they let you guess what you ate and resolve the mysteries!Likely only a once in a lifetime experience for us - if we spend that much money on food we prefer the usual procedure and also see a nice plating before eating
5
Whether or not you consider yourself adventurous when it comes to food and dining in general, NOX is one of those places you absolutely must try at least once. When I first read about this concept of dining in pitch darkness, my curiosity was instantly piqued. And when I found that that NOX has opened its doors in Singapore, I was even more excited to try it out. Last Friday, my husband took me to the restaurant for my (belated) birthday dinner and he could not have picked a better restaurant! From the moment we entered the restaurant, we were instantly made very comfortable by the host/hostess who ushered us to the waiting lounge as we wait for our table to be ready. So this is how it works at NOX: When you make your reservations via phone, they will ask you about your food restrictions so they will not include any of those in the dishes that they will prepare for you. At the lounge, you can order your drinks (they have a good selection of wine, cocktails, beer, etc) as they will no longer be taking drink orders at the dining area upstairs. You will be asked to leave your phones and other items in your body that illuminates (watches, for example) in the locker provided. The hostess will explain a little bit about the restaurant and the concept of dining in total darkness and once ready, you will be guided to your table by their waiting staff who are sight impaired. There are several steps leading up to the dining area and you just have to trust your guide completely so you won't meet any accident. It's a bit freaky at the beginning because you really won't be able to see a single thing even if you open your eyes super wide. haha. Don't worry, your waiter will explain to you where the cutlery, serviette and glasses are. If you made arrangements for a three-course meal, each course will be served in 4 small bowls and the waiter will ask you to go through the bowls in a clockwise direction. You won't know what's served in any of your bowls and that's what makes the experience much more exciting. In this case, you will rely solely on your other senses - smell, taste, touch, etc - to take you through the gastronomic journey. In our case, we found that closing our eyes (since we can't see anyway, we might as well just let the darkness wash over us completely) makes the food taste, feel and smell even better! Once you're done, you will be escorted back to the lounge where you will be asked some questions pertaining to the dishes you've tried. This is also a good way for you to test your level of awareness of the ingredients that go into your food. You can also order more drinks at this stage should you wish to do so. After filling out the form, the hostess will be showing you pictures of what you just ate and most probably, you will be very surprised by the results! We had an amazing time at NOX and I will definitely recommend this restaurant to friends
5
My husband and I really enjoyed this restaurant. We were a little worried about eating in the pitch dark, but the whole meal was like a choreographed dance. Upon arrival we sat in the lounge/bar to order a pre-meal drink, then received a briefing from the hostess on what we were about to experience. She asked us if we had any dietary restrictions, which included my husbands dislike of all things seafood. Our requests were given to the chefs immediately and were strictly followed. A sight impaired waiter had the waiting patrons, two different families, line up and put their hands on the shoulders of the person in front of them. We were walked to our table and helped to sit, then given a verbal layout of the table. The whole meal was explained step by step and the environment relaxed. It was an incredible experience and the perfect date night. The food was fantastic and I highly recommend the wine pairing. The meal is expensive, but worth it for both the food and experience. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone whose a little adventurous
5
Went there yesterday with my partner for my birthday and our anniversary celebration, and it was an amazing experience. We did not know what to expect at all prior to our reservation so we were reaallyyy excited. Not gonna reveal anything here so please experience it yourself there! The food was super nice and service was impecabble - Rahamat was our server and he did a great job calming me down and making me laugh! Thank you so so so much!It was an eye-opening experience for both my partner and myself and we will definitely be back again. Great for a date night out! :

This was a great experience! We went as a group of 8. You start downstairs in a bar like area where you can order some drinks. A hostess then explains how the night will proceed. You're then lead into the darkness by a waiter who is blind and seated. The room is utterly devoid of light. There are three courses and each course has 4 dishes. The 4 dishes are served in bowls placed on one plate. You're not told what you're eating and this makes for fun dinner conversation/banter as you put your taste senses to the test. I though the food was quite good as well. At the end you go back downstairs and you have a quiz to see how many of the dishes you guess right.The waiters/waitresses are amazing and are happy to explain their backgrounds and give customers a bit of an understanding of their lives being blind.A bit pricey but a great experience and a fun dinner idea
5
I've never heard of this before until a friend casually mentioned that we should try it, along with a blog review during a tasting session. This seems like an interesting concept though a little expensive. One should try this at least once! The staff are all very friendly, from the start till the very end. All diet restrictions were met without any problems and we did not have any major mishaps while dining. It was a great experience for us.
5
I have always wanted to venture to a dine in the dark experience and was fortunate enough to come across NOX via tripadvisor recommendation. The whole experience is very interesting, even from the beginning where we were lead upstairs to the 100% pitch black dining level. The 3 course meal was absolutely delicious - and I did not realise how terrible I was at distinguishing tastes of common foods until I compared my guess-timates (on the provided questionnaire at end of the meal) and was very impressed with the variety and quality of the food! Our waiter and the ground floor staff were so friendly! I cannot be more thankful for this wonderful establishment for hiring visually impaired patrons for their waiters. Bravo for a perfect dining experience, and congratulations to our waiter who is a recent newlywed!
5
Was a little hesitant as this was our first time dining in the dark. Am glad we plucked up the courage! The food is excellent (perhaps due to our over active senses) and the service amazing. Our waiter Jason has the nicest, most calming voice ever. He could tell we were nervous and he was reassuring us all the way up the stairs. He was also around whenever we needed him without being obtrusive. Must be six sense or something. Best experience and night ever
5
The staff at the reception and at the dining area are very warm and accommodating. The experience was unique and gives a perspective on getting in the shoes of people with disability. The food was excellent. The food are rich in taste with the different variety of flavors. All in all, it is a good experience for me and my fiancee. :
4
We started our Hen Party last Sat at Nox and it was the best dinner experience I've had in a while.The food was excellent! I was impressed that so much care was taken to prepare a fine dining 12 course meal that was served in total darkness.Normally i would not expect such good food from "novelty" restaurant such as this one.We had great fun starting from pre-dinner cocktails enjoying pleasant banter with the 3 guys at the bar, then we were taken into complete darkness to the dining hall via an obstacle course of mysterious objects (probably just tables and chairs). All which added to the fun and excitement. At the end of the meal, we even had to take a test! Winner (and loser) will get a prize. I'll leave you to find out what that prize is.Definitely a must-visit. Will bring others!!
5
This was an amazing dining experience! At $100 per head, the price was a bit steep for me but I took a chance and tried it out anyway. I don't regret it. Every single dollar was money well spent. The service from the moment we stepped into the lounge was impeccable. Staff was friendly and constantly came to check on you and brief you about what you are about to experience. The briefing helped to mentally prepare us for what's about to happen. The amuse-bouche served at the lounge was delicious and a sign of the quality of food you will taste in the dining area.When it was time to head upstairs, our visually impaired host came down to pick us. Before ascending the steps, he made sure that we were all comfortable and constantly checked on us. You literally cannot see in the dining room, not even your hands! The host understood how disconcerting it can be to us and constantly reassured us that everything is alright. The host's service throughout the meal was friendly and it was a pleasure chatting with him. We learnt a lot about the challenges he faced and his positivity was inspiring. The food itself was very very delicious, you get to sample 12 different dishes spread over 3 courses. We had fun guessing what we were eating, and the lack of mobile devices ensured that we focused entirely on the food and on conversation. This was honestly one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Do pay Nox a visit and when you do, keep an open mind. Don't let the darkness scare you. Relax and enjoy the experience, and let the friendly visually impaired hosts serve you! I look forward to dining there again
5
Was brought her on my birthday as a surprise and it couldn't have been better. I wll always remeber this humbling experience and the service we received by the blind people in the dark. The incredible. Will be back soon again to try the new menu
5
This is a must try for all people in Singapore. You are being served 12 different dishes in complete darkness by blind waiters who are just great. The food is good and you will realise how it is to be blind. The restaurant gets busy during peak hours, so try to get reservation a bit earlier or later

I've never dined in the dark before and was a bit sceptical to the whole concept to be honest. After arriving at the restaurant they explain what's gonna happen during the evening which was very reassuring. The dinner in the dark was sensational and beyond all expectations. The food and service was great and we will come back for another meal sometime soon
2
I liked the concept until I was inside. You can't see anything, but that is of course the whole idea. It just felt strange that you cannot see what you're eating. You eat like a two-year old because you don't know if the plate has something liquid or not for instance. Obviously you also cannot see your partner, nor can you talk about what you see. The service was also not good as we didn't get the drinks we ordered (twice), and the bill was wrong at the end. It's also heavy on your stomach to eat 12 completely different things (you cannot choose what you eat, everyone eats the same menu). Think twice if you really really want to experience this. And finally at roughly over S$100 per person without drinks, its's terribly overpriced

The name says it all.... you dine in the dark, seriously, you won't see your hand in front of you...Let's start.Located in a 2 storey shop house near Arab street, you'll have at level 1, a bar with some tables and chairs, where, of course you can only have some drinks before or after dinner and some lockers.The lockers are not for the staff, but for your bags, cell phone or anything else. Main reason will be that there's no way you can dine in the dark with your bag... Common sense, where will you put it?And of course, no photo allowed in the dining area... Also, that's smart to not allowed people in the dinning with their phones..... you are here for an experience and also to share it... So, advise for all the phone junkies who cannot eat without leaving their phones.... Stay home or try to have a life....Rest of the review here:https://drinkeattrip.wordpress.com/2015/06/25/nox-dine-in-the-dark

Thank you NOX for an experience we will remember for a long time. A big thank you to our serve Hafiz who made the night special. We will back next we are in Singapor

We were well-briefed on the procedure - what not to do and what to look out for. The place was pitch dark and you really need to rely on the rest of your senses esp smell, taste, touch and hearing to enjoy the whole dining experience.The blends of flavour, texture and ingredients used were really tantalising and intriguing. Good fun trying to describe the taste, texture and guess the dishes. I have to take my hat off to the wait staff - they were truly professional, attentive and skilled
3
We had a seating with 4 friends for a dinner in the dark. So we arrived almost all on the same time except a fellow who stuck in the office. Therefore we managed to wait for him and start our dinning in the dark. Food is awesome, I had the vegetarian course.After a while, I have to admit that I already tryed this out in other places and was quite used to the concept of eating in the dark, pouring in your water into your waterglass etc. My guess is that this place does a very high end service and quality food. The only drawback I remember is the tight schedule and the waiter continuously asked us to go for the next course which made the whole thing kind of a rush. Anyhow you can enjoy yourself and specially if someone brings his business creditcard and has no limitations, than the place is a real nice thing.Will try to come back anytime soon

Absolutely Amazing. Dining at NOX is a must for anyone who is a foodie! Just don't do it alone as it does get rather dull when you wait for the food! *Phones and any light omitted device are locked downstairs so no instagramming ;(*! The atmosphere and service is the stand out factor for any one visiting here, food is pretty good although you don't really have any idea what it looks like until after the meal is finished (You get to write down what you think you ate, then compare your answers on the iPad). Also, unless you eat professional for a living, what you think you ate and what you really ate will blow you away. Also major tip for the ladies, try not to wear heels as you are going to go up/down a flight of stairs in pitch black darkness, which in some alternate universe heightens the clumsiness factor.... So wear flats! :
5
You pay for an amazingly out of control experience as well as delicious food. The staff is really nice and welcoming. You walk in and first have a cocktail before you head to the pitch black dining room. They walk you up there and sit you down on your chair. It is a surreal feeling, you feel completely out of control and almost stressed initially. It really is dark and you cannot see a thing. The food comes out and it is delicious(although I'm sure if enjoy it more if I saw it). I started really enjoying the experience after the starters. Overall amazing experience, would definitely do it again 
5
Everybody else has described the experience, so I won't repeat. One of the best bits is comparing what you thought you ate with the menu after the meal. We opted for the wine pairing and would recommend it. We started with some trepidation and ended up as fans. They didn't have a soup course when we were there so no need to worry
5
Enjoyed everything. Before drinks were fantastic, service was perfect, wine selection was very good and food was outstanding.Experience is different but don't be scared, it is amazing!Go with open mind to try everything and enjoy
5
This was my 2nd visit, and again an awesome experience. Although I preferred the food of my first visit, I would recommend this concept of dining
5
We booked online & we were excited and nervous about dinning in the dark but we had the most amazing experience! Friendly staff welcomed us into the bar, the mojitos were delish. Then we were introduced to our visually impaired waiter who lead us up to the pitch black dinning room. The food was incredible & because you couldn't see it, all your senses are heightened. It was fun and interesting trying to guess the flavours we were tasting. So much food we certainly didn't leave hungry. Would recommend this to anyone and will be back if we return to Singapore
5
It was a last minute decision and so we had no idea what to expect, but you are made to feel very comfortable upon arrival, are served spectacular cocktails from an impressive menu - I had a Peanut Butter & Jelly inspired one! - and everything is explained while you settle in. Eventually, your visually impaired waiter/waitress guides you to your dining room which is in complete pitch darkness, you have to feel around to become aware of where your cutlery/glasses etc are placed. The 'mystery' meal option means that you'll receive 3 courses, each course split into 4 portions of different meals and you are encouraged to guess exactly what you are eating. The only downside would be that nothing can be too hot in case of accidents so if that is something that bothers you it is worth considering. Of course, if you are quite fussy or there are lots of things you don't like this wouldn't be a good option either as half the fun is in the mystery and trying new things - you might surprise yourself with what you enjoy when all is revealed! Overall I thought it was a wonderful experience, one you'll be telling everyone all about when you get back home! The only complaint anyone in our party had was from my chef father, he's a fan of being able to see the craft that goes into plating the food and huge portions so if that sound like you, there are lots of other places in Singapore you could visit for the same price that you might appreciate a lot more but it certainly won't have half of the novelty
5
Not sure what to expect, we were a bit anxious about our booking - we were greeted by staff that were very friendly and helpful. We went through the options for dinner, advised how the night would run and then had an apitizer and pre-dinner drink. When your booking time comes you are lead to a door and introduced to your visually impaired waiter. You are given full instructions and hold the shoulders of the person in front of you and taken to your seat. You are then informed about the layout of the table and how dinner will be served. If you choose the "mystery" dinner, you have 3 courses, with 4 tastings in each course. Wine, if chosen, is matched to the food and poured for you.It is such an experience using your senses other than your sight and there is a completely different atmosphere to any other dining experience. After you have finished your meal you are lead back to the foyer to guess what food you ate. This is such a great experience and one we highly recommend.The food was fantastic and the service impeccable

We booked his a few weeks in advance to celebrate French Mother's Day. We had been called prior to coming to ask if we had any allergies or dietary restrictions to which we responded. On the day of the dinner, we were kindly brought in the lounge which is lit and given instructions about the restaurant which include going to the bathroom before going into the dining room and leaving all personal items (including phone, watches or anything with light) in a locker. Once ready, the door is opened for us to hold the shoulders of a visually impaired waiter. We go up the stairs all holding each other's shoulders. They seat you and then bring you your dishes. These are in three course;  -appetizers: 4 dishes -main: 4 dishes -deserts: 4 dishesDuring the dinner, you use your ears more and smell. You communicate with each other in a different manner. You taste the food and guess what it may be. It's a really fun experience. The food tastes really amazing. The waiters are all so friendly and are willing to tell their story if you ask the question (be sensitive though as this is their life). Overall a great experience which I would recommend everyone.
5
An Awesome Experience to be had by all, Even if you only do it once it is something you have to try, This is for everyone, even if your scared of the Dark, Words don't Describe the experience, When they say is dark , u cannot see anything, i don't think i have ever been to anywhere as dark as this roo

We went there for our 6th anniversary. Initially we were having doubts on the quality of the food. Well, it turned out fabulous and good quality. Enjoyed it fully including the cocktails. :
5
We went there for a friends birthday and the experience started with fabulous cocktails in the lounge. The staff was super friendly and patient and explained very well to us what would happen. After which our server for the night brought us in. After 5 minutes we all started forgetting we were In the dark, starting laughing, having fun and of course enjoying all the delicacies that the chef, trained under Gordon Ramsay, prepared for us. It is a mystery diner which wakes up your senses with fine cuisine from all over the world. Because your sight can not be used, your other senses are really much more aware ... I used touch during the diner to assess as well what I had in my plate! The service was excellent, fun and friendly during the diner. We lost track of time and had so much fun. I wanna go back soon!!
5
Totally worth picking up my courage to dine in the dark. First, go in a big group of at least 4 if you have a fear of the dark. Because of people chatting, you won't fear the dark so much. The host is fab and assuring. Must have cocktails. The best I've tried in Singapore
5
We celebrated our 19th Wedding anniversary at Nox. It was a sensual experience quite literally. We didn't really appreciate just how dark it would be when we we led into the dinning room upstairs. We were just amazed at how tasty everything was and we weren't sure if that was because not having our sense on sight heightened all our other senses. It was a superb evening from the welcome at the beginning to the menu revelations at the end.By the way the pre dinner cocktails were excellent too
4
I've dined in the dark in Berlin, but the food and service at NOX in Singapore was much better. It's a unique experience, especially for first dates. You have to feel your way around the food and you take a test after your meal to guess what you ate. Good fun
5
found this restaurant next to hotel where i stay and watch this restaurant for a while. I'm curious about the concept so i just walk in and luckily they have some table for me. in professioanl and friendly way they explain me how is the concept ( like playing game using your sense and brain to taste what they serve on your meal ). while I'm ordering my wine in the bar ( they have nice wine anyway ) i have to deposit all my belonging in locker ( no cell phone, Camera or even bag allowed ) and wearing tag on my necklace. then moment is came into darkness, a waiter i can't remember the name guide me with very charming and lot of sense of humour into totally darkness dining room. he told me where is knife, glass, plate and how the meal will be serve in each step. into totally darkness and taste my food, my imagination and sensation play in a big role. i loves all what they serve, its small portion of 3 plate in each course and i just can't get enough. such as wild experience by dining in the dark, enjoying the great meal, try to guessing a food like you are pro and i just laugh so hard if my guess is wrong. it is fantastic experience i ever had, its little bit shame that in the middle of my meal, some group arriving and they make some noise which I'm sure other are not comfortable as i am. management should handle this small issue for future guest. overall, i loves the experience, i loves the waiter who serve and be my guide in the dark, i loves the meal and i manage to answer 40 % of all dishes. i feel like I'm a pro. very well done team ! NOX restaurant is highly recombined as fine dine attraction. loves it and can't get enough
5
My date brought me here, it was excellent from the start, the bartender knew his alcohol and was able to give good recommendations. Dinner was an out of this world experience, so interesting to be out of one's comfort zone and be attended to by the amazing and very polite visually impaired waiters. The food was excellent too, and not being able to see really heightened the senses of taste and touch and hearing. We had after dinner drinks too and the very friendly owner chatted with us late into the night over drinks after that. Definitely a night to remember and definitely highly recommended
5
Amazing food in the most unique setting. Having no idea about the evening we started off with fabulous cocktails that our very creative bar-man thought up. When we were ready our personal guide who is blind lead us up to our table, climbing stairs. He was very reassuring. From the moment we climbed up we couldn't see in front of ourselves as everything was pitch black. We were served our dishes and each bite was not only delicious but that we all enjoyed trying to guess what each flavour was. An amazing experience that I would love to repea

I enjoyed my experience at NOX. I had reservations with a client of mine for 6:30pm and arrived at 6:15pm. The hostess walked me through the concept - that I will be eating in the dark (pitch dark), that my client and I would need to deposit our cell phones and any other personal effects in the free locker that they would provide, that we will not be told what we are being served to eat but would be asked later to identify the ingredients (this added to the excitement that I referred to above). It was clear that the experience is based on our sense of smell, touch and taste. To take the matters one notch higher we were told that our host who will walk us to the dining room is blind by birth and has been at NOX for five plus years and will serve us our wine, water and food while we waited with our eyes wide open with visibility of zero. We walked up the stairs with our hands on the shoulders of the person ahead of us with the host leading the train. He sat the couple ahead of us first and then walked us to our table. It was a small table and I could feel the wall next to my left arm and the edge at the right side. The water came first and then the white wine to savor with the appetizer salad. I touched my salad to feel the cold noodles with pieces of meat and one bite lead me to believe I was eating noodles with duck meat and peas (100% correct, I was told later). The wine was a sauvignon blanc from New Zealand - a good pairing. So far so good. It was fun to guess the ingredients by focusing our attention on the smell and taste. I realized that the sense of touch is overrated when it comes to food (common sense perhaps but I am low on it sometimes, perhaps all the time if you ask my wife who has an over supply of it. It's a hard life in our household!).The next course was a soup with a red wine. Or so it seemed, I couldn't guess it at first but soon started to think I am eating Octopus. It was Scallops, in fact, not sure how I could be so off base unless it was the cooking. The temperature was less than perfect and the soup was rather bland. In any case the wine pairing helped. Next we were served a main course of four mini-dishes. The host explained we should eat clockwise starting at 12'0 clock position. It was okay-average (food wise). The temperature was less than optimal (I like my food piping hot and this dish wasn't). The wine served along with the main course was an enjoyable pinot noir which helped me. The main course had beef (I recognized it), tuna (got it) and two veggie dishes (cauliflower and a peas dish, I recall). The dessert was a bread pudding (served warm) and an orange cream based pudding (served cold). Overall, it was fun. Would I do it again? No, but well recommended as an experience for an evening in Singapore

Went on a Sunday night.It was quite empty when we first entered the lounge, was worried about the lack of people.After 15 mins, small groups started to stream in and we knew that we are at the right place.Was given a drinks menu to order something to drink first.Followed by an introduction by one of the staff of what to expect and how to enjoy the experience.We were served one 'teaser' dish at the lounge.Finally, it was time to head to the dining area. Behind a closed door, we were greeted by Rahamad. Rahamad is visually handicapped but he is an amazing host who has been with NOX for 1.5 years.His deep, powerful voice provided assurance to the guests and he was able to guide us through the darkness.YES, IT IS PITCH BLACK. (except for small infra red cameras at the corners)Rahamad guided us to our seats and explained the positions of the cutleries that were on the table.Food was amazing, 12 dishes in total. 4 each for appetizers, mains and desserts. It is almost impossible to guess what you are having for the appetizers and mains.One decision that is hard to make is whether to keep your eyes closed or opened. It is the same to me.Rahamad was also sharing with us that the experience of dining in the dark is what he has to do everyday. So treasure your sight!Finally, we were done, and headed back to the lounge where we were introduced to what we ate earlier on.Whole session took about 1.5 hours end to end.Definitely a must go
5
Food was amazing, cocktails were great and the overall concept and resulting experience is astounding. This really is a must do if you are in Singapore
5
The food is great and you will get to explore many different dishes at this restaurant. The highlight is however the service by the blind waiters in the dark dining room. Even though it's pith black they provide probably the best service there is in Singapore. Will be back soon again

Dining at Nox is not for those seeking a simple fast meal to fill the tummy. Ample time has to be given for one to be immersed in the experience and the initial waiting time before you are ushered to the dining room (we waited an extra half hour at the bar although we came on time).We were completely caught off-guard by the sheer darkness of the room and had to be guided by our visually impared server conga-line style. The food is a guessing game as we could only depend on our sense of taste which proves to be faulty when you realise what was actually served when they finally reveal the menu at the end of the meal (We guessed a foie gras dish as tofu!). The highlight of our meal however was our highly competent server Rahmat. Despite being visually impared, he managed to navigate the space with such ease and grace that leaves one in awe. On top of that, he manages to remember each guest's name and where they are seated. Something even most fully-abled servers will never achieve. Although the food might be forgettable, the lessons that Rahmat ("blessings" in Arabic) had inevitably taught me such as the appreciation of God's given gifts and a anything-is-possible spirit will be the most valuable take-away from this meal
4
I took my wife for her Birthday dinner, as we were bored of the typical dinner n dine.The place gives you a thrill and is eye opener for the senses.Worth a visi
5
visited NOX on 12th April 2015. this is a very special dining experience that you must try. to dine in a complete pitch dark room, initially i felt rather uneasy as I have never been in such a dark place before. after getting used to it, I am able to locate my cutleries and glasses just by touching. food prepared and the services provided were excellent. best of all is that you need to guess the food that you are eating! can't explain my excitement with words, visit it yourself
5
I was surprised with the experince of the restaurant, so far this is my best dining experience. The cocktails is great, food is so good, the best part is having dinner in dark place, something I can imagine before
5
This is and experience that's tough to explain but everybody should try this at least once in their lifetime. The surprise meal with 12 different dishes was so fun, trying to guess the food we were eating. Service from the visually impaired servers in the dining room was impeccable. Go "see" it for yourself
5
My husband and I wanted to experience the dining in the dark concept and it was such a fun night! The staff were really nice and customer service was excellent. We especially loved our very friendly host, Hafiz. Moreover, the food was excellent!! All in all a worthwhile experience and a lovely way to spend a Friday night
5
It's a place to go have a adventurous dinner with ur love ones! Especially during a special occasion, this is 1 of a great idea to surprise ur friends and family. Definitely a unique experience!
5
It was interesting concept, we can experience dining in very dark place and realy fun. Food is super nice.
5
Beyond question, NOX is an unparalleled dining adventure! Being plunged into pitch darkness is somewhat daunting however having to rely on ones other senses was remarkable.The cuisine was attentively delivered and distinctive on the palate.Specific recognition and consideration for our visually impaired, amiable&attentive!
5
I chose this place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and he loves it. It was a wonderful experience because none of us have tried eating in the dark. It was really pitched dark but we both felt comfortable because our waiter, Fabien was good. He explains to us what we will be expecting and where our utensils etc are in great details. The whole experience was a smooth and a great one.The food was absolutely fantastic made with the top quality ingredients that make all the difference. We have no difficulties getting the food to our mouth despite the darkness. There is no mess for both of us. But you may wish to wear dark colours if you are afraid that you will drop the food all over. The menu changes every month if im not wrong, and you may tell them your diet preferences if there's any. My boyfriend and I just ate whatever that's on the menu that day. It's a three course meal, with 4 dishes for each course. so you get to eat 12 different dishes. I ordered a Cake for $20 as a surprise for him after the dinner. It is a pity that they do not allow us to do takeaway because we were all too full. But boyfriend still finished it up anyway. hehe.Some blogs may advise that it is recommended not to wear heels. However, you may still wear heels if you wish too. I wore heels and many of the ladies also did the same thing. Fabien was patient when i told him i am wearing heels and have to walk slower. So ladies, if you wanna look good and pretty for photo taking, you still can wear your heels:) but i wont recommend heels for those who only wear heels once a month hahaha you wont feel comfortable on that day :)the total bill including drinks and cake which are not included in the 3-course meals is approx $250 for the both of us.Overall, we love the place and would recommend the rest to go. ^
5
It is definitely a very unique experience to eat without seeing the food and not knowing what you are eating. Was a bit nervous in the moment, but got used to it after a short while. The food is served in small bowls and each course has 4 different dishes so a total of 12 dishes to guess all together. We enjoyed the main courses and the desserts the most, but it was all nice food. Our server in the dark was great (I can't remember the name) very talkative and made us feel calm in the dark. It was very tough to guess the dishes and we got very surprised over a few when they were revealed. :) This is an experience you have to try at least once. We will certainly be back again with friends. Thank you NOX for a great evening
5
Wanting to celebrate a special occasion with a different experience, I looked up Nox around the first few months of its opening. It was a gamble as not many people had been to the place but I definitely knew that the experience will be something unique. Being vegetarians, I called in with reservations of going 'blind' on the food and choice of dishes etc, but was re-assured that all will be taken care of as long as restrictions were made clear in advance. We had an awesome time - the experience was mind blowing/different/unique and the food was top notch quality to boot the experience further up to a different level altogether. I'll highly recommend this place as a must do at least once - warning would be that one should make reservations in advance for sure
5
The NOX dining experience must we'll have been one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life so far. While the concept seems simple, it really is so much more than that.First of all, when we first stepped in we were seated in a sort of bar style holding area where my wife and I were promptly engaged by the efficient staff. She gave us their lanyard with the Braille table number for the visually challenged waiters upstairs. But even before the meal we were surprised by a sort of mini appetizer, yumz!After the climb up into the dark dining area led by our waiter. I don't want to spoil the experience of what happens next as this is really best experienced firsthand!The food itself is delicious beyond words, and you'll definitely be having a fun guessing game with the people you are eating with on what is what. Is this beef or chicken?? Or pork?? Much fun was had smelling, touching and tasting the food. It's a total of 3 courses of appetizer, mains and dessert, with 4 mini dishes in each course. Our favorites included a large creamy piece of perfectly pan seared foie gras with caramelized figs in the appetizer, and a tropical mango-passion fruit sorbet with fresh passion fruit.After the meal we are led back into the main waiting area we came from and fill up a small quiz, followed by the big reveal on what we actually ate (tho I could never be sure if the presentation was as nice as in the photos!) The chef uses an exciting mix of familiar and exotic ingredients to keep you guessing along with some.All in all a really one of a kind foodie experience, great for birthdays, anniversaries and other special occasions :
5
http://missneverfull.com/singapore-nox-dine-in-the-dark/ It was the most unique and interesting dining experience in life, as well as the most relaxed meal as we cannot use any high-tech equiment in the main dining room. No pictures, no chatting on the phone, and you can only focus on the food. Its also a nice chance for you to learn how to cherish your present life :
5
The food was pretty good but it was the experience that makes it really awesome - from the impeccable service (amazing visually impaired waiters) to really truly discovering how amazing your sense of hearing and smell was! Imagine pitch darkness - you can't see your hand even if it was right in front of your face (yes that dark!). But the quality of hearing - being able to distinguish exactly where each sound was coming from and truly truly tasting your food - smelling it as it's set down and while your mind races through your mental library to match that taste; a wonderful experience. Also helps that you really do focus on the meal and the company as you really cannot do anything else (no phones bags etc). Not something you would do everyday but minimally once in your life and returns when you feel you need a reminder of how we are so blessed with our senses
5
Went there with my girlfriend for her birthday and honestly did not know what to expect. Turns out, we both had great fun and it was an experience to remember. Trying to figure out the food that was served and just talking to each other instead of being on our phones was great. Will probably come here again for a special occasion when their menu changes. Would love to play the guessing game again. Our server was very courteous and polite. He made us feel very comfortable although we could see nothing at all. Very interesting place. A must try, at least once
5
This was by far one of the most interesting dining experience that we had! The service was great and the delivery was awesome. Felt that the food could be better. Not recommended for kids
5
Food and cocktails were great but the best part was the experience of something you would not normally do. The staff were fantastic
5
Took my parents / brother/ his wife there and had a very interesting and fun experience. The service staff were super friendly and welcomed us in the downstairs waiting area with some cocktails. My brother is more a beer guy than cocktail, but he did comment after that the cocktail he had was one of the tastiest he's ever had. The dining experience was a lot of fun, and even my mom who had her reservations about coming in the first place, expressed surprise at how much she enjoyed it
5
A unique and funny experience for my family. We had an intriguing guessing game of the dishes... basing on smell, texture and taste. 'Eating in the dark enhances the sense of taste', proved to be true. Each of us indulged on 1st round, four appetizers, served in individual bowls, starting from 6 o'clock... and went clockwise. 2nd round, four main dishes. Same route. Last round, four desserts. At times, I ended up spooning air. So, I cheated with the help of my fingers... hey, nobody saw me do that smile emoticon I bet my family silently did the same hahaha. The friendly blind host, Hariff, memorized our names; made us to pour water in our own glass. No sweat! I dipped my pinky half inch from the glass rim and waited till my fingertip felt the liquid smile emoticon I also had to feel where I placed my cocktail before I mistakenly grab my daughter's drink. After dinner, we were led back to the lit lounge and another host showed us the photos of all the gourmet meal we just feasted on. Lovely night

Went here tonight (Valentines Day) with my wife. We had some initial trepidation about eating in the darkness but had been told that it was something we should experience. We arrived around 17:20 (booking was for 17:30) and were asked if we minded sitting and waiting at one of the outside tables. We were served with a complimentary glass of prosecco mixed with grenadine and topped with a fresh raspberry. Our waiter came and explained the format for the dinner and then served us with an amuse bouche rich was foie gras terrine and camomile jelly and kampachi. These were both very nice. At around 17:55 we met by the person who would be our server for the evening and then taken upstairs to the dining room. It is pitch black in the dining room. We were served 3 courses. Each course consisted of 4 very small bowls of food. Each bowl contained something different. The food was very good but the cost makes it very unpalatable indeed. At $50 per head I would have said good experience on reasonable value, but at $144++ per head (not including drinks) I think it is exceptionally poor value. Dinner lasted approximately 1 hour and to be honest it was long enough. On a side note: drinks are typically expensive. Also whilst we were eating I asked for a glass of water and was told they only served bottled water. I thought this was a bit much at $8++. Overall it was an experience and the food was good. I wouldn't go back nor would I recommend it to anyone. If you want to eat in the dark you can do it at home for a fraction of the cost
5
I'd been told what to expect from Nox but still nothing prepares you. The food, staff, cocktails were all fantastic. Best dining experience in years
5
It was an amazing and unique experience. Food was great, service was really good. Everyone must try this restaurant.I started recommending this to friends already :
3
It is a big experience to sit and eat in the dark, but it was one I had been looking forward to, as I expected to get excited about the taste of the food as I would not be dístracted by things around me. You get a starter, main and dessert and each course has 4 small dishes in a bowl. However, I must say, that most of the food was average or tasteless. There were maybe 2 dishes I liked, but most of them just lacked taste. I expected the food to be a little more gourmet or just seasoned right. Go for the experience or if you do not have a high standard. I was more impressed by food i bought in a Hawker centre for $4 than this
5
Spurred on by experiences of friends and family with the concept dinner in the dark in Europe, we got this fabulous restaurant experience as a wedding gift. Little that we knew, we went to dine at NOX on a Saturday night in January 2015. The experience was beyond our expectations. After a short introduction by the staff and 'un amuse-gueule' in the bar area, we left all our luminescent belongings (mobile phones, watches etc.) behind and went upstairs for a 3-course-dinner, à 4 dishes each course, in the dark. And when we say dark it is pitch dark! Throughout the dinner we were guided by their blind staff who were equally lovely and personal. They made this experience even more enjoyable. It is then when you start finding our way around the table in the dark that a few words of guidance and introduction are truely priceless. The little riddles about the sorts of wine we were having and the different tastes we could divine gave this dinner an additional thrill. The food was different to what we have had expected as they specialised in fine dining, European kitchen with elements from Asia and with surprisingly lots of style and texture. All dishes and table arrangements were later revealed by the bar staff on tablet screens. After sharing our experience with friends and family we later found out that NOX, providing a dinner in the dark guided by blind staff, is truely a novelty compared to other concepts in Europe. After our dinner we found out that NOX also provides larger table setting for 4 and more people. We are definitely planning to come again, and this time with our friends and family

Food just does not taste the same anymore. You went to complete darkness in a room, where u would be seated after walking cautiously through the res. Three courses were served, each with four dishes. I think i only got 60-70% correct. Food tasted so familiar, but you could not tell what they were with just smell and taste... Although the price was a bit expensive, the quality of food and the experience worths it!

I went to NOX on a Sunday evening to celebrate my 10 year anniversary with my boyfriend. The experience was definitely different and special. I felt that it was a good way to bond with your partner as you will be relying heavily on your other senses, especially your hearing sense. The food was different as they specialize in fine dining, which was a treat. I enjoyed sampling the different and unique dishes and making guesses about the food. Towards the end of the meal I had a choking fit but the staff were very attentive and was able to provide me with the required assistance in due time by bringing me a warm glass of water. Kudos to the quick and caring response to the staff upstairs.At the end of the meal, the ground floor staff will actually reveal the dishes that was served to us. I felt that this area could be improved as the staff attending to us had run through all the dishes very quickly, giving us very little time to understand and relate our earlier experiences to the actual dishes. Otherwise, everything was great. It is something that should be tried at least once in your lifetime. On a side note, please reserve a place as early as possible as the time slots (especially for dinner) are limited and most weekends they are fully booked

Went to the Nox Dine in the dark experience january 2015. What an amazing experience, from start to finish, all the staff were very helpful and proffesional. Especially the vision impaired staff who guide you to your table and talk you through it. Food was spot on! Was suprised that I couldn't guess some fairly basic ingredients! Best thing I've done in quite a while! Recommend!!
4
This is a truly unique experience and yes it is pitch black inside, you won't see a thing! I would recommend to family, friends, couples - but probably not for children
5
The staffs are helpful and courteous.Dishes are creative! will highly recommend to friends who never dine in the dark before. With the person you love, it is very awesome experience
1
Very expensive. Nothing really tasted very nice. Customers are brought up every half hour and you have no idea who else is in the restaurant so everyone is self conscious talking out aloud. All our other senses seemed to die along with our sight. Nice idea and we thought it was going to be the highlight of our trip but it turned out to be the low point. Wish I could have reported differently.
5
Best dinner I had with my fiance. Top notch food inclusive of high class service. Will try again very soo
5
We decided to go here because it was something different that we had never done and it was a really fun experience. It was slightly odd the whole time for me as you really cannot see ANYTHING but my husband had no issues with it. I was surprised how expensive it was but the food was really good and was so much fun to try to figure out what we had ate at the end. The staff was wonderful and our server did had become blind later in life and it was amazing to hear his story
4
We had a very enjoyable meal here. We were a little apprehensive but staff are very accommodating of your needs and helpful. Our dietary needs were accommodated without any issue and it was a great experience using our other senses as we ate. Our host was a lovely man who used to work for Singapore Airlines and it was wonderful hearing his story. Drinks were a little expensive but overall good value for a degustation experience
5
I booked dinner at Nox for my boyfriend's birthday as I wanted to do something really different. I had read reviewer comments and knew what to expect. It did not disappoint. We both loved the experience of trying to use your other senses. The staff are very helpful in explaining what is going to happen when you arrive and the service is really excellent. The way our waiter Halime who is visually impaired took care of us was really amazing - I would be happy to have that kind of service in any restaurant. Would highly recommend this to anyone
5
True and indeed that the dining hall was in total darkness whereby we can't even see our fingers! Need to be done at least once with a bunch of friends. A very interesting and fun experience

I was strolling around Haji lane one afternoon and then stumbled upon this restaurant sign. Because of the strange yet interesting title, me and my sister asked the person inside what it is all about. Jeremy, the person who talked to us, explained the concept of this place really clearly and kindly! After being overwhelmed by the concept, we booked a table right away for the night after that day (it opens from 6pm).So, on the next day, we came by the place around 9pm and this is where the fun started. When we go through the stairs to the upper level, there's this transition from a weak lighting area to a whole pitch black area. The guide, Hamili, a visually impaired person, was really nice and kind to us. He literally guided us step by step through the darkness, to our table which we can't see at all. He helped us how not to mess up our dinner, haha. After a short wait, the food came one by one and man it was good! Really really good! Even though I'm not an expert in culinary, I know this is not an ordinary dish. And with the darkness surrounding you, you can feel the food with your taste buds more thoroughly, without knowing how your food looks like. After finishing all of the dish from appetizers to desserts, our guide, Hamili, chatted with us for a while. How his life changed and how all of us have to make a difference by being the difference (that is only one from many of his inspiring quotes) really moved me and my sister (she even cried a little because of his beautiful words haha).The verdict. Bring your friends, your family, anyone you know to this place! Just try it out and you will feel a life changing dining experience through darkness, 'seeing' how the world feels like from visual impaired people's perspective, and tasting exquisite food with your taste buds without having to judge it by its cover. Sorry for the long post, I just had to share this to the world. Cheers

So i stumbled across this restaurant whilst browsing through tripadvisor. Definitely it was the exciting experience of great food in the dark that caught my first attention to set this place as my friend's birthday treat. Well i must say there is mo disappointment at all.Overall this experience may sound like a gimmick, but it really isn't. The experience has really allowed me to savour the food and appreciate how much efforts the chefs have put into to craft out the menu. One thing about eating in the dark is really the absence of sight and that makes it a challenge for many chefs to score the mental wins on great food. It has to really taste out of the world! I really appreciated my meals alot, slowly savouring every bit and drips of the sauces and puree. My friend and i had the longest time away from our phone and we enjoyed our chit chats and scrabblings over what type of food we are eating. The funniest moment was when we both picked up our desserts and i argued it was a warm dish and he said it was a cold dish. We were both right! Haha. The service here is even better than the fine dining places. I enjoyed our host and the impeccanle timings he had knowing when we had finished our meals. Overall this is money well spent and the experience was awesome. I intend to bring my colleagues here next time too. They will love it too
5
This has to be up there as one of the most unique and memorable dining experiences you can have. Eating in pitch black darkness is a surreal situation and trying to guess what you are eating is actually a lot more challenging than it sounds! The cocktails were some of the best I've had and hearing the waiter's story was humbling and heartwarming in equal measure. You have to try Nox if you are in Singapore you will not regret it!
5
Definitely one of the best dining experience. great food and cocktails. dining in complete darkness was a sensory experience. will definitely go back again!
5
I've always heard about this place, and finally managed to try it out. Was a little nervous but excited all at the same time. You are literally forced to used your sense of touch, smell and hearing. Which is really quite an experience, I have so much respect and an additional new found respect for the visually impaired. This place is so amazing I'm lost for words and I just keep bragging about this to my friends. The experience you take back is so much more than whatever you paid for it, I would say it's a value for money. It'll help you to be so much more grateful than you are for your ability to see colors and be able to understand how important communication is. The food was amazing, I felt like I could taste a burst of flavors which appealed to me so much. I will definitely come back here again very soon, and probably bring my own friends along this time instead of going with family. x

We booked this well in advance. It was a great experience. We had 3 courses which consisted of 4 small tasting size dishes. You really increase the use of your smell as this place is completely black. Your lead to your table and feel for the glass, cutlery etc. a very different experience which was worth it. I would only need to do it once. Great service

Stumble upon this place on the internet while searching for a restaurant....Decided to give it a try and went with my friend. The first experience was marvelous... The people were friendly..they explained everything very clearly.. We had our dinner in a pitch black dining room, where there isnt a single light able to be seen. Extreme pitch dark, that its equivalent with eyes closed. Our food was extremely tasty.. not only that my friend was a vegetarian and they able to cater to the vegetarian needs for my friends. Both myself and my friend enjoyed very much.. Its like every other senses comes alive to taste, smell, touch and hear the surroundings.. The food were in bite sized and awesomely delicious and it was super fun guessing the food we are eating.Not only that, it gives us a insight of how visually impaired enjoy their food. Its a rather a fun and amazing experience. When it was time to know what food was being served after our dinner, thats when we realize we couldnt some of the food when it those food we usually eat. hahahah.... since than we agreed to next enjoy and savor our food when we go outside and eat.2nd experience was with my mum and sis and its very fun and they really enjoyed themselves very much. They have never been to such a place before but they greatly enjoyed the delicious food and the ambiance.Overall, its an awesome place and its a MUST GO! Make time in your calendar and book this place! Its a life time experience which will never be forgotten! :

Just been to NOX yesterday with my girlfriend, the service was great. Having to dine in a total darkness, unable to use your sense of sight. I'm able to feel, smell and taste the food that is being served to me. Unexpectedly, the food taste even better than any other food which I had eaten before. The staff was great, they were polite and provide us with fantastic services, from introducing us to the concept of the restaurant, to guiding us to the order of the food to be ate. One of the visually impaired staff, Raman ( apologise if I got the name spelled wrongly ), he was specially kind to us and shared with us about his experience. I would suggest couples to go there for a total new experience. It's a must go place.

If you are ever in Singapore, make time for NOX...it will change the way you think about food, interact with your partner, friends or family and removes all distractions with the food really shining. From the moment you walk in, the service is great and they were very helpful to get us out within 2hrs from seating as we had friends to meet back at the hotel. Also, everything in Singapore is so expensive and surprisingly, for such a wonderful culinary adventure, NOX is reasonably priced. One comment would be that I wish the food was in pairs of 2 as they come out with 4 dishes each...for every course, the 1st 2 of each course paired nicely together with complimentary flavors...the 3rd each time threw my husband and I off a bit and generally we didn't enjoy it until we waited a few minutes, had some drinks and then tried it again so I wish that they either went better together or they split them up into more courses.Either way, the food is stunning when you see the pictures after and the flavors are complex. it is also a great experience everyone should have to experience a small slice of life in someone else's "shoes"
5
Went to NOX last week with some friends; what a fantastic experience!Great staff and I think it is great that visually impaired staff are employed as servers and guides in the pitch black dining room. Eating in the dark really enhances your senses and it was great fun guessing with friends what we were eating. The wine pairing option was a nice addition too. I will certainly visit the restaurant again and I recommend everyone to try NOX at least once. You won't be disappointed
5
A must visit when in Singapore!We had a wonderful experience at Nox, the service was great and the food Modern European cuisine was excellent. I will definitely be back on my next trip to Singapore and I really recommend a visit to Nox for a fun and different experience!Don’t miss out on the Cocktails :

Dining in a pitch black room, served by blind waitstaff. When I heard about this from a friend I met in Thailand who just happened to be going to Singapore the same time as us, we made plans to do this and I'm so glad that I did. This was undoubtedly one of the most interesting things I've ever done. You're seated in the lobby with a menu to decide what you want; we did the "ultimate NOX experience" and I would highly recommend it. You get a small appetizer and cocktail downstairs. When you're done, you are led up a staircase and into a room with your hands on the shoulders of the person in front of you, hoping you don't bump into anything along the way because you literally can't even see your hand in front of your face. Once you're seated, your appetizers arrive along with your first glass of wine assuming you do the wine pairing. I'm not a wine-o by any means, but I was glad to have splurged for the pairing as you get a glass with each course, the first cocktail and coffee or tea at the end. Your server will describe where everything is on your table so you can feel it out. About by the time we were done with the first course, I think we had pretty much got the hang of eating in the dark. Muscle memory I guess, you just remember where you left your fork, water/wine glass, etc. So unless there is some other offerings, I think the standard is a three course meal consisting of 4 plates per course and you eat in a clockwise fashion starting from 6 o'clock to 3 o'clock. It really makes you use and appreciate your scent and taste buds since you can't see what you're eating and guessing what you're tasting/smelling really makes you question how refined your palate is or how far off you are from reality. Our waiter told us a little bit about himself and how he lost his sight and his story was pretty inspiring. At the end of the meal, you are led downstairs to find out what each dish was and it's fun to talk about why you thought something was what it was (or wasn't) with other people you were eating with. I enjoyed every dish, some of which I didn't like having had them before; I won't say what because I don't want to spoil anything for anyone. This was extremely enlightening and I would suggest it for anyone whose never tried such a thing

Was excited to go there after some advices from friends. Lucky to win tickets for two at the Norwegian Seamans Church "Julebasar". Was welcome by pleasant staff and had a realy small starter in the lobby. No telephones or lighting items was alowed in the dark room. Was followed to the table and seated without seeing anything. Closed eyes or open eyes, no different.The menu was Starter, Main and Desert with pairing wine. Each containing 4 different dishes. Amazing how the different is to eat something you can not see. No advanced judging. The food was excelent and tasty. Wine that goes wery good with the food. Recommended
5
From making the booking, walking in the restaurant, explaining the experience to be was top notch!The "briefing" so to speak was explained in a zealously interesting way that they have already wet your appetite. While waiting for the table to be ready they'll offer some cocktails that are just outrageously good. Upon getting to our table with the aid of our visually-impaired guide briefed us on what to do in a pitch dark dining room. Every bite was an experience from the appetizer to dessert everything was outstanding. If you are a foodie type of person. You will enjoy this experience as every bite you are guessing what in the food rather than just chewing and swallowing it. Maybe that explains why some other people have negative reviews, they just dont know how to appreciate food.The fun part is the little quiz after the dinner, eventhough we know we wont answer everything correctly but we still hoped for the best.Price was a little pricey though, but it is worth it if you are dining to celebrate a special occasion or some sort. However, if you are just dining for the sake of dining the experience might affect your perception of this nice place

It was an interesting experience and it does really get you thinking about the realities of living without the benefit of vision, although my seat was facing towards the area where the food was brought up from the kitchen and checked with a flashlight before being given to the blind waiters. This wasn't perfectly shielded from the dining area so I kept seeing a bright area which was quite distracting.While I enjoyed the experience I was left quite underwhelmed by the food itself. For a start they mixed up the dietary requirements that we had told them about in advance, meaning I got an altered menu and my girlfriend got some dishes with ingredients which she had said in advance that she didn't like. Luckily there weren't any allergy issues but it could easily have been worse! There were some interesting dishes and some good flavour combinations but I found that all of the meat dishes were overcooked and quite tough.It's definitely an interesting experience which I enjoyed, but for $100 I would have expected a higher standard from the food
5
Nox Dine in the Dark allowed us to experience dining that goes beyond the presentation and flavor of food. While the meals served tasted really good, eating and conversing in complete darkness with the assistance of visually-impaired staff were the highlights of our evening. It was a humbling experience and made us appreciate what we have.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at nox. We started with an amuse bouche and cocktail when we were still able to see and both were excellent, in fact one of the better cocktails I have had! Then we made our way up to the dark dinning room which was bit nerve racking but provided plenty of giggles. The food was good, but made made better by the whole experience. We had the wine paired with the meal which was excellent, and the service could not be faulted. Not only would I recommend Nox but I will go back next time in Singapore
5
Goodjob NOX! Its definitely a meaningful dinner for me n my bf.We get to understand how the blinds live in the dark. Its very impressive of how they overcome it. We celebrated my bf's birthday there.We love the service. Kudos to the well trainned server! We will definitely refer friends to NOX! Not only that, we love the food! Much love with thanks 
4
Unique experience and nice food, we were a little uneasy having to follow the waiter to the dark room as there were stairs, though everything went smoothly. Cocktails were surprisingly good but a little on the expensive side. We had to remember the things we had eaten and write them down at the end, it was a little hard to remember as there were too many small dishes.The consAfter finishing our meals we had no idea how to leave the place, it was awkward having to shout for our waiter. Kinda slow to start the meals, could see that they were waiting for other parties to be ready before briefing.Overall everything had been pleasant, will return again

Food was ok - nothing really special especially when considering the priceService was greatBig groups - you are stuck with the two people sitting next to you - hard to have a conversation with any of the people not sitting right next to youNot a fan of unisex toilet
1
For the price you pay, the food experience itself is pretty bad. The food wasn't tasty - really quite bland and boring. It definitely was cool sitting in the dark and interesting being served by (very skilled) blind servers, but they didn't have enough staff on and I felt the employees were being over run with a full restaurant. Our group left hungry, bored by the food we ate and just kind of annoyed at how much we payed..
5
My daughter chose this as an experience and I had no idea what to expect. Dining in the dark served by vision impaired staff. I was excited but nervous. Well this is the most unforgettable experience I have had. From the time we entered until we left the service was outstanding. Our waiter Harizz? was so humble and accomodating. Checking that we were comfortable with everything and we had a clear understanding of how it all worked. All the food was delicious and to find out at the end some of the things we ate was surprising. Loved loved loved it and won't spoil it by saying anymore. Please think outside the square and try this. You won't be disappointed and you will appreciate your smell/feel and taste so much more
5
I have never thought having dinner at a pitch dark dining room but it was possible and interesting.The waiters are cheerful and helpful at the dark, and the food was fun to guess! Time to experience a whole new dining
5
was there on 23rd oct 2014 , started out with 2 drink(s) strawberry fields and ignite my passion , good start to the meal . dining in the dark was just excellent . Hafizz ( pardon my spelling ) was a total gentleman and kickass host, need were attended too faster than most normal lighted restaurants . truthfully - a very humbling experience . sight is something we take for granted. food wise it was fun . trying stuff which i wont normally eat is something everyone should try at least once . if not twice. =Psecond row of drink from the bartender clement was good too - jealous something and a specially made gin combo was what we needed after the hearty meal . last round of drinks took the cake thou. - manager justin ? Jospeh ? starts with a J made 2 really awesome drinks - a spin on the classic bloody mary and a kaya cocktail. trust me. just go there for the kaya cocktail. nuff said

We had a wonderful experience at NOX. It was my sister's 21st birthday and I wanted to give her something precious that she would remember and we would talk about years later. This dinner in dark is the perfect birthday gift. I think our story was funny as we arrived way early to the restaurant. One is because I need to use the ladies and the other was because we hate being late for our appointment. When we arrived, right after using the toilet, we were greeted by Jeremy-the restaurant manager. He was surprised to encounter us inside the toilet as he wasn't expecting any guests. He was nice, greeting us with an introduction of the restaurant and how dining in the dark works and showed us to our host, Halimi. I have to say that the whole experience of not being able to see what you eat is a 'nice' kind of scary and exciting at the same time. I personally am a really picky eater. But inside the dark room, accompanied by my sister, we've both tried on things that we would never eat if we knew what they were. It's funny how your brain, taste buds and stomach works together to accept the food offered to you as a surprise. That's what you're paying for. The experience of a lifetime. :
4
It's my first time there with my husband. And I was quite worried I might freak out in the darkness. However our host Halimi is very friendly and puts the diners at ease. It also helps that there's soothing music in the dark dining room. And tasting food without seeing them - it's pretty challenging. Your expectations color your taste. I was quite surprised by the taste of some dishes which I assumed wrongly to be other meat / veg

You may not be receptive to the idea of eating in pitch dark, not knowing what goes into your mouth. But everything was absolutely wonderful. Staff service was great too! Dining area was pitch dark, you can only rely on the 4 other senses to complete the 3 course dinner. The food was simply fantastic. Cocktails are good too. If there is a complaint, might perhaps be the portion of the food . Other than that, I’d definitely return
5
Funny, great and delicious. Really unique experience. A must for everyone in Singapore! We had fun, the employees were friendly, the evaluation was good.
4
Booked a table for 2 to celebrate my partner's birthday, pretty amazing experience. As we are both chefs, we had fun listing out all the ingredients and preparation method. Pre dinner drink was quite a disappointment though, bartender spilling here and there as I watch him making my cocktail. Overall good experience, I will be back for more.
5
We decided to celebrate my birthday at Nox and it was an absolutely delightful experience. We started with a briefing as to how the dining process will be. The walk in the dark towards our table was a real challenge for me and it was amazing how a visually impaired host led us safely to it. The food was amazing and kept us guessing. All in all, highly recommended. Definitely a must tr

It's really a unique experience, we went to give it a try, and the service is really good. When we first enter, we were seated in the lounge area and were given a little explanation on whats gonna happen inside the dark room and ask if we had any food allergy. Next we ordered our drinks, and we went ahead to the room. The guide was "Hafiz" we was visually impaired and he know his way around the room really well. We were greeted by Hafiz and he guide us to our table. He and his crew's service was good and really friendly. Next we are served a mystery 3 Course Meal, 4 Dish each. (im not going to spoil it for you guys, experience the food for yourself) that's because they change their menu every 4- 6 weeks if i'm not wrong, so just experience and taste it for yourself. Some dishes taste are good, some just not really to my liking.At the end of the 3 course meal, we were then being brought back to the lounge area where we can see again. Then we were giving a survey to fill up what dish we think we had, they will next show us the actual picture of the food and tell us whats the ingredient.Overall coming here is really a good experience, that is because we always judge the food before its served, some food really taste good yet they don't look as appealing or even sounds appealing. Give it a try, go with a open mind! On a side note, if you want to visit this restaurant, i would encourage you to not drive, because there is really limited parking around and its a big hassle trying to find a parking lot in the area.If you do drive, you can try parking at the Plaza or Park Royal Hotel opposite side of the restaurant
4
It's a really cool experience. And my friend and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend people to try it at least once. :

We decided to visit NOX as we wanted to try something different on my birthday and the reviews here really built up our expectations. While making the reservations, my husband mentioned about our dietary restrictions - I am a vegetarian, my husband is not but he is allergic to specific seafood and mentioned that he is okay with eggs/chicken/fish etc. The experience of dining in the dark was unique and very interesting. Kudos to the visually-impaired staff in the dining area. We were led in and seated by Hamish (if I remember correctly) and he very clearly explained the layout of our table, where the cutlery and glasses were. What we found average was the food. Four dishes in each course over three courses. The portions were tiny - more food and less number of dishes would have been better. Also, I don't think the restaurant is as competent in serving vegetarian fare as they are with their normal menu. Some dishes were good but the majority were pretty average. My husband was also served the same food as me because they don't serve chicken or fish (either it's all seafood or none - you can't have only fish!), which is amusing and disappointing for a restaurant trying to make food the hero in this whole experience. After we came down to the lounge area, we were given feedback forms and asked to guess the ingredients in our meal. The hostess for the evening sat with us and elaborately explained to us about our meal and it's constituents while showing us pictures of their current (non-vegetarian) menu. The pictures were a reference point as our meal was tailored to my preference. Which brings me to the point that there seemed to be a discrepancy in the portion size shown in the pictures and what was actually served to us. Remember, we were also using our hands to feel the food so we knew that the bowls were only half filled, except the salads. The good stuff - we guessed nearly all the ingredients/dishes correctly! :)It would be great to see the restaurant come up with a better menu for those with different food preferences to the one they currently offer on their menu. I would rate NOX very highly for the service, for the concept, for the visually-impaired staff but average for the food

My husband and I went to NOX on 5 Oct, to celebrate our 1st year Anniversary. My husband gave me shock look and followed by an excited smile after the staff explained to us what would going to happen later. (It's a surprise for him)Actually I was a little panicked as proceed to the dark, but the friendly staff had well taken care of us. After awhile, I feel more relax.Their dishes are just so tasty, delicious!! We are so focus on the dishes which made us forget about the surrounds. We feel so peaceful yet so cool during our "Journey". Before we went for our bill, the staff came and showed us the dishes which we had. It is an unforgetable experience for memories for our special day. We will be back very soon and looking forward to the surprise dishes again
5
My girlfriend and I sent to NOX on 4th October 2014. It was meant as a celebratory dinner for ending mid terms examinations. Upon finding out that we were going to dine in the dark (I kept it a surprise), my girlfriend panicked a bit as she was apprehensive of the dark. However, the friendly service staff managed to give us a comprehensive briefing which calmed us down enough to enjoy the great cocktails and taster. We were led up by a visually impaired staff. Despite that, he was more assured with his footing and directional sense than us, especially in the dark. The entire restaurant was dark! It was impossible to see anything at all! However, our amazing waiter explained to us where all the utensils on the table were, along with what to do and how to enjoy our dinner and make the most of our experience. When the food came, we faced some difficulty in eating without using our eyes. However, as the meal went on, we became more adept at it and started to enjoy ourselves in immersing in the experience and trying to identify the different food. While we had problems identifying the food, one thing was certain: the food was amazingly good!After the meal, we were led down once again by our friendly waiter. Below a the lounge, we were attended to by another friendly waitress. She went through with us the different foods we ate in each course, explaining what the taste was like and why we would think otherwise. Hearing how most of our guesses were wrong was pretty funny! All in all, the experience was very humbling. To have one of your main senses just removed like that really helps you to understand the plight of the visually impaired. It was an experience like no other, building empathy while providing good food! Good food, Great service and an unforgettable experience at NOX

Dining in the dark was quite an experience for me. You may not be receptive to the idea of eating in pitch dark, not knowing what goes into your mouth or dirtying yourselves. But trust me! Everything was absolutely wonderful. Staff service was great too! Dining area was pitch dark rely on our 4 other senses to complete this 3 course dinner. To Rahamat who assisted us in making this dining experience so wonderful, we are so grateful to you! The menu was simply fantastic! There was no compromise on food quality. My personal favourite from each course were pan seared foie gras with avocado and sushi rice, the wagyu striploin with edamame and goma dressing, as well as the chocolate cake with chocolate mouse and raspberries. Give it a try
5
It's a unique experience . Friendly staff and great service . The food taste great . Cocktails are good too . If there is a complaint that I need to make , might perhaps be the portion of the food . I m a big eater so the portion wasn't enough for me . Other than that I love this place :

Myself, girlfriend and two friends dined here the other night. You walk in, they sit you down and tell you what is going to happen. They gave us an amuse bouche as we waited for our table and ordered a bottle of wine as well. Then we were led upstairs and once everything becomes dark it becomes REAL. This is really in THE DARK. 3 courses came out in groups of 4...so when Apps came out there were 4 spoons..you start at 6pm then 9pm, 12 and 3. Discussing the bites was interesting in differing views---this really reminded me of the Top Chef challenge a few years back. Once finished we were led back down and filled out a questionnaire of what we thought was in each course.... and then shown on an iPad pictures of the dishes we had and ingredient lists. My group faired pretty well!! We thought one dish was tuna or salmon but it was eel. A few we nailed that might be a little tough were tripe, fig and tomatoes. Easy ones were peanut butter, truffle oil and arugula.Overall an awesome experience and I highly recommend

We was in town for the formula one and was staying at the park royal opposite. Didn't really know where to go for dinner so using trip advisor this restaurant came up with good reviews and close to the hotel. We took a stab in the dark and thought we would give the experience a chance. Very unique experience and would totally recommend this to anyone, reasonable prices and great food. To taste anyway!

This is probably one of the most unique dining experiences I've ever had. Having your sense of sight taken away while dining was intimidating at first but then when you start relying on your other senses, the unique and delightful experience that this spot offers begins to unravel. The very well trained staff guide you as you savor each dish (or when you can't find your utensil or glass). Trust plays a huge part in your enjoyment so make sure to come with it

NOX has an intriguing concept of dining in complete darkness and takes great lengths to ensure that its guests are well taken care of in the process.From start to finish the service is complete. It starts with a pre dinner introduction and briefing from the host on what to expect, and the procedure of the dining experience. We were then introduced to our server Halimi, who despite being visually impaired, made us feel wonderfully at ease and confident in his abilities. He guided us through the pitch black dining area and even served and cleared our food completely unaided.The post dinner briefing then lets us review our experience and reveals the menu with a thorough explanation of the ingredients.The only drawback is that the food was not as interesting as one would have expected. The cuisine was wonderful enough for a normal fine dining, but not exciting enough for a restaurant capitalizing SOLELY on it's sensory experience of the food it serves.It is a good one time experience for novelty seekers, but the food needs to pique our interest to attract returning customers. They do however change the menu every month, so let's wait and see how NOX improves

The whole experience at Nox was amazing. Their cocktails offerings are some of the most interesting and tasty I have had anywhere, the food was delicious and the wine pairings were good. You will be asked before dining, if you have any specific dietary requirements.As for the darkness-amazing. It really is pitch black in the restaurant and your eyes will never get used to it, so you will have to rely on the other 4 senses.I always thought I was good at identifying flavours but it is harder than I thought when there are no visual clues. Textures also become more significant in the dark. The waiters always seem to be on hand if needed. The explanation of the food we had eaten was most welcome at the end, but I felt this was a little rushed and the quiz we were given was a little gimmicky.My husband and I really enjoyed this experience, but for me, it was a one-off. However, my husband would quite happily return again and try a different menu--they change their menu regularly
5
Excellent service. We well taken care of from the time we stepped into the restaurant.Helmi was both passionate about his service and enlighting. The food was good. NOX definitely made my birthday a memorable one.

Great service at counter; explanation of what to expect. Of note, the serving staff are visually handicapped, and I appreciated their efforts to make us feel at ease and comfortable in complete darkness. Felt safe and confident with their care. Eating in the dark- gave me a deeper appreciation of the food- the smells, tastes, textures. No distraction by what I see (eg. "Eww, looks gross, I'm not eating that!"). Just eat! No photography; and patrons tend to be quiter in the dark, so very private environment. Quality of food worthy of degustation menu. I will definitely go back again.Only obvious "downside" is: I wouldn't bring children! Also not for those with clasutrophobia, or fear of the dark :

I picked this place for our anniversary dinner and i'm glad that my husband and i did enjoy the experience as this place is totally different from the usual restaurants that we usually patronize day to day.The staff explained what are we going to experience after sitting us down at the lounge.. I don't really drink alcohol during weekdays so there isn't much on the drinks menu to for me. I would like some mocktail though.. We were brought up to the restaurant by the waiter. Oh my, it was really pitch dark and i was walking in small steps as i was afraid that i may trip. The waiter encouraged me to take bigger steps and not to be afraid ! My eyes felt some stress after sitting down for about 10minutes. I think they are struggling and trying very hard to project images as our basic instinct does so i closed my eyes... It was so much better. Why not ? Since we can't see a single thing with our eyes open.The waiter will brief you on what's on your table, you gotta try and feel it. Food wise. I am so not adventurous. There are so many I-DON'T-EAT on my list and i listed it out during reservation. No doubt i know that i will not be served food that i don't eat but i still feel quite apprehensive when i started with the appetizers. I kept thinking - What is that ? But when it comes to the main course, i just eat la. Don't think so much. But also trying to figure it out as we need to fill in a 'test' after dinner. So. I enjoyed the desserts most. I love them all but i can't disclose what were they as NOX changed their menu every 4-6weeks. You gotta experience it yourself ! Here comes the mini 'test'. I tried hard to remember what i had in appetizers/main course/desserts. And i am very surprised that what i thought it was(a few item) was totally different from what i was served ! Such a pleasant surprise that the chef can prepare food in such a way then you mistook A for B.I agree that servings are small but this doesn't pose a problem for my husband and i as we are small eaters. We find the serving just right. We came on a weekday evening, 630pm. Very early but we were the only table and we had a quiet and private time ! When we were done, there are few more groups coming in. So probably you would like to go for an earlier time slot if you can. I would definitely recommend my friends to give it a try. :

All in all, food wise it was enough to make you full, service wise was extremely good, be it that the servers are special or not, it was worth the money sent there, great atmosphere! A must to visit

When my fiancee and I first went up, I suddenly was hit with a realization how it would feel without my sense of sight. I started to understand how tough it must be for the visually impaired. However, our server was excellent in making us feel comfortable and sat us down at our seats - and showed us by touch where our utensils were.I ordered some water halfway through our meal, and I had thought it would be fun to experience how it would be served to us. However, what I got was a touch on my arm and a bottle of water passed to me instead. That was the most interesting challenge I got for the night as I had to figure out how to not knock over my wine glass and how to fill up my empty water glass.Here's a trick for all of you out there, place your finger in the cup and pour - once you feel some water, stop. Also, it will be helpful to start from the sides of your table and den move your hands slowly to the centre to feel for your cups / utensils.Of course, after an hour or so we got used to the darkness and became pros at grabbing our glasses and even feeding each other! So, THANK YOU for not spoon-feeding us and letting us face these real challenges that visually impaired people go through everyday. We had a chat with our waiter, Hafiz and he was sharing with us about how he copes with everyday life - and sharing how the hardest thing to eat would be a meal with bones. It was so easy to connect with him that my fiance and I are planning to attend his upcoming wedding!Foodwise was awesome, definitely tastes better with our senses heightened - plus it was really fun to guess what we were eating :) All in all, my fiancee and I had a very very memorable, and at the same time humbling experience

I came across NOX since last year when my friend told me about it. Went to read about it, and wow, such an interesting concept of dining; dining in the dark, and bang, it's gonna be in my bucket list!Just few days ago, I put a tick to NOX on my bucket list! =)) and I am glad that I have made a great choice in penning it down last year.An interesting concept is an understatement to this awesome place, IT'S ONE OF KIND EXPERIENCE!! I am someone who have been to fine dining, not all places have excellent service, awesome food, great ambience and friendly staffs in a package. What else more can one ask for when dining at a restaurant with the full package?! Furthermore, you get to experience the living of a visually impaired person, from walking up the stairs to your table, pouring water into your own cup (not knowing when it will be filled) and throughout the whole 3 courses of putting food into your mouth, it's all by yourself and your sense of touch. I am glad that we were being attended by a good host, Hamili (visually impaired), who was able to let us entrust ourselves to him and guiding us in the dark. At the end of the whole dining experience, the staff at the lounge will be screening the answer for the dishes that you had, to see how many dishes you have actually got it right. Pretty interesting as you will know how well your tastebuds are serving you. haha. Though it's a bit pricey, it's definitely worth the go for this pleasant and unique experience at least once! =)) As for me, I will be going again in another few months, as this restaurant changes their menu once in 5-6 weeks! =)
5
Expecting a novelty experience, I was hugely surprised when everything from booking, arrival and explanation, drinks orders, food and service were excellent. The food was very good and eating in the dark really enhances those taste buds! I would definitely recommend nox

Had heard good things about this restaurant & I wasn't disappointed. The whole experience was very different & fun. The staff were very attentive & our initial introduction was very informative. The chilli cocktail my husband had was fantastic. The food was very good & interesting trying to remember what we had & guess what it was.

Laze at a corner watching how other mess up their dining table, being overly self conscious abt how elegant one dine, e ability to see whats on e plate; cant deny that e sense of sight is taken for granted more often than not. At NOX, its not abt closing your eyes and just eat, its dining in pitch darkness which will bring out e best of other senses prolly 6th sense too. They took serious consideration into individual food preference or allergies, and will subsitute with equally good ingredients. Visually impaired waiter/waitress will be serving u a 3 course meal with 4 different food per course at $88++, totally worthy of every penny! A place where u eat first see menu later to minimize preconceived notion of certain food. Whatever happens in e dark stays in e dark, devour your food anyway u like! Be adventurous and make your reservations now!

Food in Singapore is nearly always tasty and unique because of the influence of many regions. Often the best is to be found in the local hawker centres and some of the non tourist/expat restaurants. During a recent trip to Singapore for work I had my family with me and we, along with a friend, decided to give the quirky a try. NOX sounded right up our street so off we trooped.The bar area is the only place that’s got regular light…that and the toilets. The guy who looked after us (cannot remember his name but he was Dutch) was funny and mixed great cocktails. I had a chili spiced drink and it was hot (spicy) and delicious. The others loved theirs too – both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. This is also the place where you get to find out what you ate and pay the bill.The experience is unique for sure and probably the best part of it. You are taken upstairs from the bar to the restaurant by you partially sighted waiter and it gets steadily darker until pitch-black…you are not able to see your hand in-front of your face. The instruction from the waiter was excellent and you quickly get used to not being able to see although one of the party dropped his fork…too many cocktails I fear…but the waiter was there and replaced it immediately. Finding wine, cutlery and plates does require a lot of feeling around so don’t go with somebody you don’t know!!The food is OK and by Singapore standards nothing to get excited about. Given that one of your primary senses is disabled I’d have expected them to go all out on taste. They serve 4 dishes per course and they are relatively small and we all commented that fewer dishes, more food and more taste and they’d be onto a winning combo. We actually left the restaurant feeling like we could all eat something else. We’ve had the “dine in the dark” experience and we all agreed we would not return for the food, which is a shame as it has the potential to be a really good idea
3
I like the idea of the restaurant, so we decided to give a try.A lot of reviews said the food is fantastic, giving me a high expectation before I visited the place. However, it turned out that the food quality was just normal and acceptable. The tables were very packed and people talked so loudly. The experience was not enjoyable at all. The noise from the other tables were very very disturbing. We couldn't even talk to each other during the dinner. We couldn't even hear our own voices
2
It is unique for Singapore but you pay mightily for the dark. After this experience, one easily recognizes that seeing your repast is an important factor in the total appreciation of a meal. The food was tasty but again you can enjoy the same in Singapore at 1/2 the price and avail yourself of the gift of your sight. Also on the negative, drinks are overly pushed on you and the drink menu is without stated prices. Overall an interesting concept that could be more favorable in a better business model
5
The welcoming staff did a very impressive job of welcoming my partner and I. There was a very luxurious vibe and relaxed setting in the waiting lounge. The appetizer served is a teaser of what really lies ahead. Savor it, enjoy it - your taste buds will surely be awoken from the weirdest corners. Pick your drinks wisely. Something too strong or too light might not allow you to fully appreciate the food waiting to be served. My partner and I decided to go for the wine pairing (2 or 3 glasses), and I have to admit that the restaurant's choice of wine was truly spot on. Take note that water is not free, as I did hear a few others making such requests. If you have food restrictions, it is best to let them know immediately as well.The entire length of dinner is an experience on it's own. Depending on how well your body is configured, you will immediately realized how your body is able to adapt to the new environment almost after a few minutes. The background music is a a reliever that reaches into your soul and takes you to a different place altogether. Like a slow sailing ship unlatching from the dock, you start to take notice of the smaller things. The lack of mobile phones or watches means that meaningful conversation can finally take place in an unhurried manner. NOX probably didn't realize the positive effect this has on busy Singaporeans - so kudos to you guys.With the food served in a 3 course setting, your appreciation of texture, flavor, smell and taste is at its best. Familiar accents begin to unfold through both crunch and velvety ingredients. You will be brought back to nostalgic moments when something familiar reaches the palate. A little trick is to hold the food up to your nose to smell first, before using the spoon to take a bite without worry of a spill or an embarrassing stain to walk away with.But I have to also add in here that the highlight of it all for me personally are the desserts. Imagine staring down the highest cliff at the beach with pure crystal clear waters down below, and when you finally take that leap through the burning afternoon sun and sink into waters - that is what it will make you feel after spending a day out in the hot and humid weather. Simply refreshing and unbelievable.Dinner is concluded again in the lounge with an explanation of the food served.A little mark down for the price value, but you do get what you pay for. Perhaps a special price for returning customers might do the trick. Or a little happy hour post-dinner.In summary, if you're looking for an extremely unique experience much less heard of in Singapore, and don't mind the pinch on the wallet, then go for it. Highly recommended for a once in a lifetime experience. Word of caution: you probably will not taste food the same way again. In a good way, of course.sidenote: NOX would remember me, I suppose, as the person who commented, "I have shamelessly and disgustingly licked every bowl of dessert on my plate." Fun times, can't wait to be back! ;

Taking for granted the five senses we were given, Nox truly has put four to test. Without sight, we were made to heighten our remaining senses just to eat and drink; actions that we've taken for granted. The host was amazing, sharing his experiences with us. There was only strength, resilience and courage in his voice. This is a restaurant where there is no boundary seperating the host from the patron. We were dining amongst friends with no shame between us (spilling water, eating from the bowls, dropping food on ourselves, etc). It was the most enjoyable and relaxing atmosphere

i was there to celebrate our anniversary, the place is fantastic the foods was delicious but bit expensive then you got small portion. this place is good for celebrate special moment
5
After much deliberation we decided to try Nox a try, unsure whether it would be totally awesome or somehow a bit of a gimmick. Pleased to say it was categorically the former. From the minute you walk in the staff are extremely welcoming, helpful and very professional. Nice selection of cocktails to choose from as you wait to be shown to the dining room, and a little amuse bouche to start the appetite off. You are then escorted to the stairwell to meet your visually impaired guide. The wait staff are truly amazing and very inspiring, their ability to navigate with apparent ease is so impressive. The ‘tapas’ style concept with the dishes works very well and it is a unique experience eating in the pitch black, and surprisingly difficult, not that I thought it would be in any way easy, but it is amazing how you struggle after the removal of one of your senses! If you’re looking for an insightful, interesting and very different dining experience then look no further

The whole experience and introduction was wonderfully orchestrated. Fahiz was our server and gave us a lot of insight with his challenges and how he enjoys giving us a memorable dinner at Nox. I felt that We were talking too lough becuase our senses are all on the alert and adjusting to the dark.Food for the three courses was a good balance. By the time we finished, we had forgotten some of the ingredients used for appetisers. Trying to guess some of the dishes can be challenging.I will do my part to spread the news & encourage others to support the visibly impaired
4
My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our 1st year anniversary here and I must say it was such a wonderful experience! We had their national day menu and the food was pretty good! I thought the portions were small but by the time I was done with my 3rd main course, I was already full! This was an eye opening experience for both of us and I must submit that I was quite scared when we were being guided to our table in the dark, I was focusing on not tripping and making a fool of myself (although nobody will see me anyways). Overall we really enjoyed ourselves
5
The money you pay is definitely worth what you get to experience. What NOX offers is more than just the exquisite food served.This dining experience has left me with a greater respect for the visually impaired and greater courage to chase after my dreams. Something that seem impossible (like eating in the dark) is possible if we are willing to take that first step of faith and try it out. Thanks to our great host Halimi for being part of this experience. You have inspired all of us with your sharing! Highly recommended!p/s: was a little disappointed at the end of the dinner because we gave called & gave instructions to bring in a surprise cake for our friend just before we leave the place... but the cake was brought out while we are still busy filling the survey forms
5
We came for a special ocasion and we didn't expect the experience we had. Although we knew it was a dinner in the dark, the whole experience is still very very surprising, over our expectations
4
While my visit I was pulled by this concept of dine in the dark by Nox. Something which reminded me that food can still taste the best when you got poweroff back home and there is no reason to panic.On the other hand, it tastes better as all your senses are concentrating on food only, rather then looking at the table next to you or what someone else ordered.Brilliant concept, worth a visit. Be ready to shed some $$$$
5
This is the first time that I have ever tried eating in the dark.Before arriving at NOX, I was a bit worried about how will I be eating the food, if they serve something as simple as a chicken chop, how will I be eating it.After arrive, we were greeted by the friendly staff, with the great explanations from the staff on what to expect, we felt relieves and excited about it and we can't wait to enter the room to start our dining experience. We were lead to the table by Mohammed and the food were served by Hafiz and Mohammed.The chef prepared a 3-course meal that consists of 4 ‘bowl’ of food per course. Won’t be saying what we ate, so this will be something for you to look forward to when you visit NOX.During the meal, the only challenges that we face are the position of our fork & spoon, our drinks and the wooden plate that hold the 4 ‘bowl’, we need to remember which bowl to eat prevent from taking an empty bowl up. As well as not to drop anything onto the floor when we place the items down, as this will be dangerous for both the staffs or everyone who visit the place as we won’t be able to see the hazard.After the meal, the friendly staff actually show us the photo of the foods that we ate and we manage to guess most of it correctly, as some of the taste are so familiar but unable to get it right when we are eating it quite often.Thank you so much, Team Nox for the wonderful experience.Looking forward to my next visit with friend

My friends brought me to this restaurant last year for my birthday. It seems that reservation was made months before. We had complimentary (or was it not complimentary?) drinks before the dinner. When it was our turn to be led upstairs to an absolutely pitch dark restaurant, our server, I can't really remember his name (goldfish memory me) got us to put our hands on each others' shoulders. He's kinda tall for me to reach actually. Haha.. He led us to sit one by one, carefully, even pulling our chairs for us. Also told us to start our appetizer from 12 o'clock, and proceed clockwise, for every dish. We had time to feel around the table. Water was served, and we learnt to pour the water into our glasses ourselves, using our sense of touch. As it was really dark, totally nothing that our eyes can focus on. You can really feel your eyes trying repeatedly to focus on something and failing. In the end, we decided to just close our eyes. It's an experience for choosy eaters, but the food's rather smooth sailing for me, nothing that taste weird or nothing that i can't really swallow. When we finish our dinner, we had to call our server to lead us down. That, is important, because you can't see them, they can't see you. But the amazing thing is, our server remembers our voice and came to us after we attempting afew times calling his name wrongly. Sorry for that though!When we came downstairs, we feel totally sleepy. Haha! The staff downstairs showed us the picture of the food served after we were told to write down what we thought is in each dish. Overall, its really good experience except that it's really expensive

Its the first time my wife and I trying out NOX as part of our Wedding anniversary celebration. It is a very amazing experience for the both of us to dine in the dark when hold our hands during the meals and focus 100 % on your partner with no other disrupting activities like surfing the social media or looking at email. Really appreciate these 45 to 60 minutes dining in darkness as it allow us to appreciate life and what we are taking for granted all along.Food wise, my wife is a picky about vegetables. BUT! the brilliant chef managed to make her eat all her vegetables in her bowl (because of darkness?) and she does mention the vegetable are made delicious to her. Despite that I keep scraping my table instead of my bowl for my food, everything that I ate is pretty surprising. There are really food that you are unable to recognise.Oh!! remember to inform the staff on food restrictions. The restaurant can cater your needs. Price wise, on the expensive side. But given the fine ingredient used, still considered reasonable I guess. Do not think its economical to go regularly for dinner but for special occasion its totally cool
5
I thoroughly enjoyed the experience at NOX. It was pretty crazy to be in complete darkness. I have a completely new appreciation for visually impaired people. You should dine here
5
It's hard to give a good review to a restaurant that basically made you look like a complete idiot...the Dine in the Dark concept is not new to me, as I've heard about it many, many times, but this is the first time I'd tried it. We went as a small group and were initially a little put off by the price (SGD102 per person, not including drinks) but the general experience is completely worth it. You are taken by visually impaired waiters to a completely blacked out room and given 16 dishes to eat (broken into starters, main courses and desserts). Obviously there's an opportunity there for the restaurant to make you eat some very strange things you wouldn't normally try, but they don't do that. The food is very good and the object is to try and talk about what it is you think you have eaten and then when you are finished and you go back downstairs, you are shown what you did eat. I won't go into the menu here as it would spoil the surprise, but needless to say, we got it all completely wrong - and when I say completely, I mean utterly wrong. The experience is a must - it will teach you to appreciate beyond measure the value of sight and also just how much your taste buds rely on your vision to understand what it is you are eating. The cost of this place is expensive, yes, but it's worth it every now and again. There aren't many restaurants out there that provide not only good food, but also a genuine educational experience that really teaches you to appreciate what you've got
5
Visiting Singapore for the first time and going to a place like this, gave me a strange feeling. To dine in complete darkness with only vision impaired people assisting you is an unbelievable experience. It makes you realise what they go through every day. It is certainly out there as far as dining experiences go.... Way out there. You could not see your hand in front of your face. I will probably not repeat the experience but I'm certainly glad to have visited the NOX while in Singapore, and just for the record the meal was excellent. WELL DONE
5
100% go when you're in Singapore... The staff are excellent and so is the food. For a fun evening in Singapore this is a must do
5
I took my family as a complete surprise and it was! It is such a different way to enjoy great food. The food is really excellent with the opportunity to sample 12 dishes in one 3 course meal. We had such a laugh too. Being a real foodie I was worried the meal would be disappointing. You have to go to believe how dark dark can be. I couldn't even see my husband's light coloured shirt when right beside me or even my hand 2 inches from my face. Weird! The staff were fab and the whole evening ran very smoothly. We decided to go for the pairing wines through the meal and enjoyed a good bottle of wine in the bar beforehand which put the bill up a bit. Not a cheap meal but for a truly unique experience. I think it will be something I will remember forever and in that way it was worth every cent. I would, however, recommend going in a group rather than as a couple - much more fun

When i was in singapur for honnymon 2 monts ago i have been in dine in the dark for some drink and dessert. I can say best desset in singapur and cocktail also realy nice thanks for everythink

Breathless!Service.Management Staffs. We had a warm welcome by the management staff whom took time to explain to us the process and even the genesis of the company. Little details like our food allegies were noted as we would be dining in the dark. As I had a very heavy and late lunch, the staffs were understanding and gave us time to chill in the cosy reception area prior to our dinner. Well, we also had a nicely decorated appetisier as I am sure I will not be able to see the presentation later.Service Staffs. As we were handed over to our friendly and attentive service staffs, our visually challenged waiters were very assuring in details like how many steps ahead, whatâ€™s on our surrounding. A nice feeling of back to Army days of pitch dark navigation excites me. Food.Presentation. With our visual senses removed, we have to heighten our taste sensory and I can even tell that despite the lack of visual presentation, I am confident of the details in the food presentation! I know I ate the crust at the top layer of food and my tongue can fiddle to know that there is still emphasis placed on the presentation (although visually not able to verify).Quality. The details spent in ensuring the right taste was impressive. You can tell the freshness in the food. I can eat in peace although I may not be able to guess what I was eating then. Credit goes to the earlier query on my food allergy. PricingHi-end Food. For the hi-end food that we received, it is definitely value for money. Priceless. To have such good service, food and experience, theses are happiness that money cannot buy.In Sum, Breathless

I dined in NOX with my girlfriend for a special occasion. The downstairs section of the restaurant is really nice, with a very nice relaxing and elegant atmosphere. We were soon served a small appetizer (extremely tasty) and introduced to the restaurant concept and how it works. We decided to order two cocktails, which were served by the barista himself, a very nice person by the way, which were amazing. One was a spicy cocktail with vodka and chili and the other was a rum passion fruit cocktail. Once ready, we were guided upstairs in the dark dining room by one of the visually impaired waiters whose name I believe was Muhammad. We were both quite nervous at first, but it turned out to be an excellent experience and fun. Together we tried to guess all the dishes and courses which were served to us making it extremely entertaining while in the same time, having a real fine dining experience. The service was excellent, even though it was not easy to call for the waiter's attention but it all worked out well. All the food was tasty and at the end of the night i felt really full, which i would have never expected in such a fine dining restaurant. After dinner we thanked and chitchatted with our waiter Muhammad before heading back to the lobby area where we had a couple of glasses of good wine before heading back home. A MUST TRY experience, definitely will do again

My husband brought me to NOX for our 7th wedding anniversary as a surprise. Initially, I was a little nervous, for someone like me, who likes control, having one of my key senses denied, made me feel very vulnerable.My visually impaired host was very friendly and he took care of us well, always checking if we were doing alright and if the foods were to our likings.We were served appetisers, mains and desserts. Each course came with 4 small bowls of different dishes; we had a hard time figuring out what we were eating. Although the food all tasted very good, but being a visual creature, I would really like to appreciate the presentation of my foods before eating them, so I had to get use to smelling my food instead of admiring them and to me, it was an usual experience.It's really a good place to go for couples because in the darkness, you only have each other, and no distractions from anyone or your phones, so you can expect some meaningful conversation
5
Celebrated our marriage anniversary here yesterday and was a surprise for my wife and she loved it. It was indeed a memorable experience for us and an eye opener on what it feels to NOT see and use your other senses to survive.. staff was very friendly. Felt good to get disconnected with the outside world and spend some quality time with my wife..superb!
4
This was the second time I have eaten here. The first was soon after it opened. It certainly has the weird factor going and it takes some time to relax and enjoy the process. And enjoyable it can be. I recently returned with a visiting friend who wanted to try it. You start downstairs with an interesting cocktail (mine was chilli laden) before losing anything that might light up (phones, watches etc) into a locker and be led upstairs by Halimi, the sight impaired waiter. It is as disorienting the second time around! To the food. Having established our table location by feel, we had three rounds of four courses adjusted for dietary requirements. Mostly delicious and some surprises for the punters when they see what they ate. We are conditioned to eating as a visual activity but it can be so much more. Overall, loved it and a good night out for visiting guests.

My hubby specially planned this wonderful experience on our wedding anniversary. This is an unforgettable experience with delectable food, wonderful hosts and surprises. We dined in pitch darkness where there is no difference to whether you open or closes your eyes. We marvelled, were impressed and appreciated the excellent services by their visually handicapped staffs as they manouvered with total ease throughout our dinner. Instructions were clear, menu was impressive and the fun part was trying to offer a toast to my hubby in darkness as well as guessing what we ate at the end of our meal. I learnt to appreciate my eyes even more and feel for them. Special cocktail selections completed a memorable anniversary date with NOX

Really loved a whole pitch dark dining experience. We have requested for vegan food, it was surprised, delicious taste and more than we expected..Service was friendly and very informative. One of my best dining!No phones so you really spend quality time with your friends/partner.Highly Recommend for vegetarians

I held my breath as I held my Halimi's (my service staff) arm, as he started to lead me through the pitch dark dining room. Was I walking straight? Was I going to knock into someone else's table? How was I going to sit down without falling over?!The experience at NOX was extraordinary to say the least. It was fun, challenging and inspiring at the same time. I'd brought my boyfriend there on our anniversary (well, they do say love is blind) and it was indeed a very meaningful and memorable way to celebrate the occasion.We loved the food. Perhaps being robbed of our sense of sight made us more perceptive of smells and tastes, and this brought out the flavours of the dishes even better. I guess I shouldn't reveal what we ate, but you can look forward to quality ingredients (foie gras, really good beef, salmon etc), some surprises (think escargot and ox tongue!), and lots of flavour. We couldn't name a favourite because everything was just that good! Oh, and just FYI, there'll be an amuse bouche at the lounge before your dinner, and this will be the only dish you will be able to see. It was really fun too, as we played a guessing game to guess all our dishes - and we were pretty close ;)The drinks were wonderful too. Now, I can probably count the number of times I've had a cocktail in my life with my hands (I don't really like alcohol), but the Strawberry Fields that I ordered had just the right balance in sweetness and strength of alcohol that...I might just be converted!Also, I think the restaurant is doing a great job in ensuring their customers leave not just with a satisfied tummy, but also with a meaningful and memorable experience. At the end of our dinner, we were told of Halimi's story of how he lost his sight after his brain tumour surgery, and how he remains optimistic and makes the most of each day now. His hope continues to be a reminder to me to be the captain of my life and to grasp every moment of my life.In all, the entire experience at NOX made it a really special way to celebrate my anniversary, so thank you! :)P.S. thanks to the other friendly service staff who explained the concept really well and made us feel so welcome (sorry I didn't get your name

The concept is interesting: robbed of one of your senses, does this enhance the others? Those wanting to know the answer should try Nox! You are served a 3 course "tasting" menu with 4 small dishes per course in a pitch-black dining room. The only light is the very faint glow of an emergency exit bulb, but this is so dim, it doesn't change the density of the darkness. Your waiter is sight-impaired and quickly introduces you to his world, showing you how the blind need to be guided when trying to navigate around a strange environment. Walking up a flight of stairs relying on a hand on the shoulder in front if you was a good introduction to the evening, as was finding the right glass and learning how to pour from a water bottle into the glass without soaking yourself or your table. The different dishes are arranged in small bowls on your plate and you are instructed to start at the 6 o'clock position and move on to the 9 o'clock position and so on. Having everyone follow the same direction allows you to guess at the contents of each tasting which is part of the post-prandial exercise. Overall, our table of four had a great time, including my 15 year old son. We learned to eat in the dark with minimal spillage and enjoyed guessing at what we were eating. Conversing in the dark is also an exciting experience because you can't see facial expressions and there is a tendency to speak more loudly. The food was good, though not all dishes took advantage of the ability to surprise with unusual flavors and textures. The wine pairing was also good, but not exceptional. The $165 per head charge was pricy considering that 2/4 dining had either virgin drinks or a single glass of wine. This experience deserves a "very good" for quality and value, but an "excellent" for novelty

I took my wife for a surprise meal at Nox. Questions about 'What shall I wear?' and 'Shall I take my sunglasses?' were difficult to answer honestly!The total dining experience is quite unusual - when they say 'dark', they mean just that! You can't see the table, cutlery yet alone your partner....and the incredible (visually impaired) waiter who brings your wine has to tap the glass so that you can locate it.we felt that not being able to see the food (which is very good) didn't enhance the senses - on the contrary, we now know that the sight of what you are served enhances the enjoyment. It was amazing that we couldn't detect a number of the ingredients.Great experience - definitely give it a try!P.S. Don't dress up - you might end up 'wearing' some of the food

First time dining in the dark without knowing what's in the menu. Food is nice, service is good. Will definitely visit again.

The concept : a dinner in a totally dark room, based on a fixed menu, that can be adapted to your food allergies or diet. The menu is made of 3 courses, each one of them comprising 4 dishes. It can be accommodated with a variety of wine options. No lights or light emitting devices are allowed inside : lockers are available. The experience is about food & wine tasting with only four senses.When arriving at the restaurant, you are being explained everything nicely : the high level of service starts here. After a possible first drink in a dim light lounge, you are guided into the 100% dark dining room by a blind waiter/waitress, who will be in charge of you until you come back out of the dining room. This part is interesting as you feel your waiter moves around as if it were bright light, whereas you walk with hesitation and touch with care everything to picture objects and memorize their location.You are literally introduced to the table : towel, cutlery, glasses.... Water is brought to you and you are asked to help yourself (fill glasses up in the dark and pick a way to avoid spilling... but, hey, no finger in the water, please !).Then dishes arrive. You have been warned : there is a test at the exit. So you try to identify and memorize every ingredient in each dish. Fork or spoon ? It is a try and error game.12 dishes later (and possibly some wine on top), you are full and ready for the final test.Of course, during that dinner, you also felt more and more comfortable in the dark and joyfully chatted with the waiter. You leave the dining room ; it takes a while to get your eyes ready for light.Then the quiz starts : you write down the dishes you could recognize, some key features or whatever information you remember. Then the staff unveils the menu, with pictures of the dishes. Comparing gives you an idea about how your eyes can affect your taste : most interesting ! Finally, the whole experience was very interesting. With a very thoughtful assistance, you get used quite quickly to dine without using your eyes. Yet, identifying what you eat is another story : the menu comprised simple-to-guess dishes and some more elaborated ones. The result is that nobody reaches 100%. They change the menu every month : ours was the last evening for a menu that included ox tongue and escargot, ie not exactly everyday dishes ! The staff adds insightful comments about our perceptions : the discussion involving personal experiences is passionate !The service was outstanding throughout the whole process : from booking (1. On line booking is easy. 2. I had to cancel at the very last minute a first booking : no questions were asked, no bitter comment but smiles and "book again some day, please" only !), until on-site explanation, care and attendance, post-dinner debriefing and then a nice thank you email (without any request to rate their restaurant on any website like Tripadvisor, like some do insistently).Where is the missing star in my rating, then ?- pre-dinner lounge cocktail took over half an hour to get ready : the cocktails were delicious but the wait was too long.- too many of the dishes in the menu were heavy or oily, even fatty. Those were not my cup of tea. A menu with lighter dishes, finer blends of products close to the original raw elements with various spices, would have been preferred. But that probably is a question of personal taste and maybe next month menu will be refined and get lighter ?- wines were awkwardly paired with the dishes : a very nice Pouilly Fuissé really indulged our taste buds but the following Australian Shiraz made little sense with the main course.Overall, this restaurant is a great experience I recommend. And you can make the pleasure last a bit longer strolling in Kampong Glam for an easy digestion

Dining at NOX was an "Eye-Opening" experience. In the 90min, my mind & heart "saw" what my eyes failed to see. Relying on your other senses of touch, smell and taste to orientate and form a mental picture of your surrounding. One is forced to focus on the present and to live in the present fully without the usual distraction of our phones and other factors. The 3-course meal with twelve tasting items were exquisite (you could tell from the masterful blend of flavors that caressed your tongue even though the eye could not see. A definite MUST-TRY dining experience, I would go as far to say that is might just be my favorite dining experience ever. Kudos to the wonderful team at NOX. Highly raved and recommended

I visited the shop on my own in order to find out ehat is the concept and how it feels since I heard many people mentipned anout dine in the dark.I love the moment when I smell the food then taste it. I rarely (or never do this) in my meal when i just eat as a routine. The feeling is just too good and I tried to guess what was the dish once it came out hahaha... I ate total 12 small dishes in 3 main courses... ~^^< And my ear started being more alerted than it did. I could notice the surroundings without my visible sense.It is just amazing experience that i have had with great food, friendly staffs downstairs and helpful staff as Halimi :) i realized from him that Life goes on and we should never give up! I don't be affected by he crowd since I came there quite early (6.15pm) so I could get high chance of observe almost of my senses.Staffs said the restaurant will change the menu in every 5 weeks. So I'd love to be there again in the next month. Generrally, I was very impressed and I love this restaurant

Bf brought me here to celebrate my birthday. At first, I was quite skeptical about the whole concept and boasted to my bf that my night vision is superb. What a joke! This restaurant makes sure that you CANNOT see in the dark AT ALL. Not even if you put your whole entire hand in front of your face!To be honest, I was pretty scared at first when Rahamat (our host) brought us up the stairs. I became a lil emotional too when I realised who he really was. I was already reeling in my emotions when we were brought human-train-style to our seats.I think up to now many reviewers have already done their fair share of spoliers in their reviews. My advice to patrons would be to be prepared to taste what you would usually not eat and be mentally prepared for what you can or cannot see. There's no need to dress up as it is more important to be comfortable while being in total darkness. Last but not least, just close your eyes and enjoy your food, otherwise you will be very distracted by a splitting headache as your eyes try its best to send signals of nothingness to your brain.All in all, it was a very romantic birthday dinner (at least to me) because even though the restaurant ended up being quite bustling, it felt very private as I cannot see. As I was quite afraid, my boyfriend held my hands most of the time and I could only concentrate on feeling his hands. Rahatma was very attentive and professional, often checking on us after our meals. A must-try for couples. Maybe next time I'll try organising a hen party there and see what happens

Visited with a group of friends when on vacation in Singapore.I've always been a bit reluctant in trying out these kind of establishments, but fortunately my friends persuaded me. If they hadn't I would have missed out on a fantastic experience. The food, the drinks, the friendliness of the staff and the overall exiting feeling of dining in the dark.Thanks for a great evening! When in Singapore the next time I'll make sure to swing by..

Made a reservation for a gf's big 3-0 celebration and it was an awesome experience. It was nerve wrecking waiting at the lounge as we didn't know what we will expecting but the chef set our expectation on a high level when we were served with a welcome dish. IT WAS SO GOOD! The dining experience was truly one of a kind and the 3 course meal is sooooooo delicious!!! Each dish uses quality ingredients. Totally will recommend this unique experience to anyone out there BUT if you are afraid of the dark... it can be a challenge!!! will definitely come back again...And also, a shout out to our guide. We were very inspired by you, Halimi. When we learnt that he was visually impaired after a surgery and chose to continue his passion despite the obstacles he had to overcome. SALUTE

Nox was fabulous from start to finish. Cocktails at the lounge were amazing and the reception staff were friendly and very attentive. The dining experience was amazing. Trying to figure out what you were eating was a lot of fun. Definitely go for the wine pairing option! The food was fabulous. After the dinner we went down to try and guess what we ate and have some after dinner drinks. Again, the staff was very attentive and friendly. We spent quite some time speaking with fabulous bartenders and could have stayed a couple more hours just relaxing in the bar. Our waiter shared his story with us before we left the dining area. The experience was heart warming and unforgettable. I will definitely go back and bring my friends to experience this place. I will probably go back just for some amazing cocktails at the bar ;

Recently i went with a friend to try Nox and it was simply the best best best experience i'd ever had in my life. Being led up by a visually impaired guide named harliq, who was really hospitable, dining in the dark where you have to rely on all your other senses to figure out what you're eating - truly mind boggling. I spent about 2hours in Nox eating the huge aray of dishes which they prepared for us and i must say that i'm really glad they didn't compromise on the food quality AT ALL. All the dishes were cooked perfectly, well seasoned and absolutely delicious! The portions were a tad too big for me though so by the time it came to desert, i was quite full. Nonetheless, the whole experience was astounding! They change their menu every 6weeks so i'm definitely going back to try this soon. Its an experience worth every cent - premium food and lovely experience

We ate here with friends. It certainly is a unique experience and we're glad we did it. It was fun discussing the dishes and trying to figure out what we thought we were eating, and we had plenty of laughs. Halimi did a great job taking care guiding us in and out of the dining area, and throughout our meal. It was interesting to hear his story.There was either a lack of staff or lack of attention in the downstairs bar. Annoying wait to get drinks menu on arrival, having to chase waitress to place drinks order, then as our cocktails arrived told we had 7 minutes before we'd be taken upstairs. Juggling ice cold slippery glasses whilst in a human chain in pitch darkness added to the challenge. The price for the set meal is fair enough given the unique experience. As I've said, it was fun trying to guess the flavours and textures, but in all honesty there was nothing we ate that wowed us. The drinks are pricey - two types of cocktails we ordered were too heavy on the ice. I had the birds eye chili cocktail which initially tasted great but got diluted by all the ice. Wine is also expensive. The waitress apologised at the end of our meal for any delays so the staff were aware of struggling to cope with the numbers of guests.Second time in a year I've eaten in a pricey restaurant only to discover it has unisex toilets. Until all men learn where they're supposed to be peeing, unisex should be banned.Overall, a fun unique experience but be prepared to take a hit if you enjoy some alcohol during your evening out. And maybe consider going during the week for a chance of better service for your $$I've rated it very good based on the unusual experience
5
The service throughout the night was nothing short of prompt, polite, and extremely friendly, with warm, welcoming hosts and servers once inside the actual dining area.The tasters we had before we were guided into the dark section were exquisite, followed by a series of varied and well-prepared tasty starters, mains and desserts.Inside the dining area it is completely pitch black and impossible to see anything. This makes for a fun and interesting dining experience, enhancing your focus on the meal itself, and ultimately enriching your tasting of said meal. Each part of the meal (entree, main course, dessert) came with 4 different small dishes for a wide array of flavours. My personal favourite dishes of the night were fried oysters with peanut butter and thai chilli sauce, penne with pesto and escargot, and red wine poached strawberries with vanilla ice cream.All in all this was a fun and fascinating night that I would fully recommend to anyone looking for a unique experience and amazing food

Nox was a fun night out. The staff downstairs were good but the real stand outs are the visually impaired waiters upstairs. They way they operate with their disabilities is truly inspiring. As far as the dining experience. Eating in the pitch black will be a confronting idea to some but it's well worth it. It's really quite a fun challenge using your taste smell and touch to figure out what your eating. The food itself doesn't blow your mind but it is tasty. The price tag is a little high probably but it's an experience different to other nights out and one you will probably only do once. Definately worth a try.

This is a truely unique experience. I had heard abouth these sort of restaurants in other cities but had not imagined the experience.The evening started with excellent service, an opening drink and a small snack. We were then briefed and moved into the main room. It was quite a different experience - while feeling safe at all times - it was very dark and quite different to other things I have done.We were then served a three course meal - where the food standard was as good as any restaurant in Singapore - the waiters were very attentive and helpful in making sure that you could find everything and that you didn't spill things. My wife ordered a drink of water which was an interesting experience in itself.Once dinner was over we were then escorted out of the room and then debriefed.It was a really interesting night.We went with a 3 and 6 year old child - and they did really well - but I can see some kids who can't sit still having issues.Anyway - something quite memorable

I recently visited Nox as a birthday treat from my husband. We were very much looking forward to the experience and it did not disappoint at all! From start to finish the service was great and we were made to feel extremely welcome.The service in the bar area as you enter the restaurant was great, with a fantastic choice of cocktails, and an extensive drinks menu. We were briefed, and well informed as to what to expect when we went upstairs to the restaurant and how the evening was going to pan out. Entering the restaurant part itself was daunting. And yes, it is pitch black. However, we were lucky to have a fantastic host/waiter in Halimi. The dining part is most definitely an experience to remember. Three courses, each consisting of four small dishes. My husband and I really enjoyed playing the guessing game, trying to figure out what the food was and what the flavours were we could taste. The same for the wine we were served. The hardest bit was actually just trying to remember what we thought we had eaten so we could fill out the form when we got back downstairs!Once we had finished eating and were ready to head back down to the bar, Halimi showed us the way and took the time to thank us for joining the Nox team that night. He also gave us a quick synopsis of how he lost his sight. What an inspiration. If the whole experience of dining in the dark and having one sense removed temporarily wasn't enough, listening to Halimi's story really made me realise just how lucky we are. To finish off, one more cocktail in the bar, whilst we found out what exactly it was that we had eaten! There were a few dishes that we guessed and were shocked that we were really far off the mark! And some dishes that surprised me that I would have never ordered from a menu in a normal restaurant. I would highly recommend visiting Nox, if only once. You won't be disappointed. I would most definitely return again. Thank you for making my birthday such a great experience

Decided to take my wife here on our short Singapore vacation as something a little different. Wonderful experience, delicious food and educational. Our waiter was the best thing about the night. He was super friendly, witty and welcoming, and at the end of the meal, also explained to us some of the difficulties he faces on a daily basis as a blind man and helped us to understand how we can help those around us with vision impairment.The other thing we loved was how it forced us to turn off our devices for a night and just enjoy good company and conversation. Definitely worth checking out for yourself, though the only thing I would say is that it was relatively pricey. The bill came out to around $250 for the two of us which included a drink each, still water ($8/bottle), tax and service charge. However we didn't mind paying a bit more to support the social aspect of the business, providing good and meaningful employment to the visually impaired. Overall, great experience and would recommend it to others
5
We were a little anxious at first knowing that we will dine in a pitch black environment. Halimi made us feel at ease and we were very excited as we tried to eat when we can't see a thing. It's a must try experience for anyone who is keen to explore new dining places. The food is so good that I was hoping to have extra servings! Would definitely recommend my friends
5
NOX....meaning "night" in Latin was just that.....kind of funny that a part of this review asks about atmosphere......well, it was pitch black :-). Halami was our host and what a true SPARTAN he is....ask him what that means. Dining in the dark was quite the experience. It truly did make me appreciate how some live every day. Remarkable people. The food experience was fantastic. We were able to identify most of the things that we ate however, there were a few that surprised us. You definitely won't leave feeling hungry. All the different dishes will not only fill your belly, but it will fill you mind as well. I would highly recommend this to anyone. My guess is if you do it once, you will probably go back with friends
5
What we would usually look when dining in a restaurant is the ambience and quality of food. My first experience in NOX on 08 May 2014 was totally extraordinary. Dining in the dark? YES! We were served by professional host, Halimi, together with his colleagues who rendered good services. The food were creatively prepared and delicious. Care was taken to ensure that diners with dietary requirements were served with the right food. Halimi's service was excellent. He made us dine at ease, relaxed and he has also inspired me! It was a marvellous experience! I can't say more....you've got to give it a try! =

We had a wonderful dining experience tonight thanks to the fantastic staff and delicious food. We are looking forward to dining again soon
5
It's been a few months, and I was spurred on to visit again when I had some great friends from Norway visit again, and Martha remarked, I want to visit this "Dine in the Dark" place I heard about. (Apparently not from my previous review though).So I made reservations, a week ahead, and off we were, to one of the best restaurants I dined at last year.The nice lounge was well-kept and looked as good as it did my first visit when they first opened, and the friendly smiles were just as warm, and the service now has a more professional and organised feel, making it an even better evening. We ordered wine and cocktails at the lounge and though they were busy, we were never hurried to get to dinner.My friends showed the same surprise I did on my first visit when our visually-impaired host came to get us from the lounge downstairs to our main event upstairs.The food was great, served in their prix-fixe menu of 4 each of starters, mains, and desserts. Without being a spoiler, I thoroughly enjoyed their latest menu, which again showed the culinary genius of their chef, with contrasting, yet well-balanced flavours. This time around, I must say, the desserts blew me away. Our host, Halimi (I think) also took time engaging us about his positive outlook in life even after suffering his visual impairment, something I believe everyone can learn from.Our evening ended with a coffee downstairs back at the lounge and some more wine (who could say no in a nice environment like that?)Overall, my friends from Norway were totally impressed, even wrecking their brains on how they might try to have a similiar restaurant in Norway, LOL.My advice to TA readers, go visit NOX, it's an experience you will always remember, and it's well worth a second visit. (I'm planning my third soon). Cheers

My boyfriend took me out for a special date night, arrived at the restaurant on Beach Road and already fell in love with their interior on the first floor. Love the service from staff on the first level and of course the great service from Rahamad on the second floor. Not to mention the great food and how the experience actually enhance your sensation, give your taste bud a little test. Being in the dark room, one can enjoy fine dining in the most relax manner too! Not to mention we loooove the bar, and theiir drinks.. we would come again just for the drinks! Overall a very interesting and fun experience, would definitely recommend it to my friends
5
Our last night in Singapore and we were looking for a memorable experience, and we were not left short at NOX. Dining in the Dark, you definately eat with your eyes and when that sense is taken away and all you have is smell, taste and feel then what you eat may not be what you think and this is the experience at NOX.4 EntrÃ©es, 4 Mains & 4 Desserts served as individual meals on a tasting plate, and served by visually impaired wait staff. You are surrounded by other couples or groups sampling the experience, muffled words about what this or that taste is, adds to the unique dining experience.Once complete you head downstairs and are informed what is was you actually ate. The bride and I got about 60% right. I wont go into what we ate, but let me say every mouthful was enjoyable even if I didnt know what it was.The meal including wine and a cocktail came to about $160 including taxes, not cheap but memorable

I brought my wife for her birthday celebration on 2 May. When arrived at the door, we are welcome warmly and usher to the bar counter seats whereby the manager explain to us how the whole concept work.We also order 2 cocktails while waiting for table to be ready.We had ordered 'A touch of Rose' which was really refreshing and my wife loves it.I had also order 'Don't tell Eve' which have a complex taste with slight bitter which I personally felt good. When proceeding to our dinner, we are usher by one of the visually impaired crew.True and indeed that the dining hall was in total darkness whereby we can't even see our fingers and my wife got to hold tight onto the crew's arm and I m holding hers and was lead to our seatWhen seated, the friendly crew explained on the number of course we are having and how we should start.Maybe due to the total darkness, it increase the excitement and curiosity on what will be serving.When the food was served, my wife and I were discussing on what we are eating now and of cos, how nice the food was!We are really so glad that we had chosen here.With a total of 12 varieties of food serve in small bowls of our 3 courses meal, each type taste so delicious that my wife keep repeating and ask me to come here again on our anniversary.After each course, we will call out the name of the crew and they will be assist us on our request and lastly to usher us back to the lobby after completing of the 3 courses.At the lobby, the manager request us to write down what we guess we had eaten and share with us the actual food in pictures thru his iPad.Overall experience was so great that we actually took a lot of their business card to introduce it to our friends
5
One of the best food experiences i ever had! To eat this kind of exelent food in complete darknes was a total new experience for me. The staff was so proffesional, and it was amacing to hear and feel them work in complete blindness
4
We went with a team from work and had a great night for the experience of 'dining in the dark'. We didn't feel that the food was excellent however it was overcome with the experience of the night.The wine was very expensive so we were quite shocked with our bill. It was a good one off experience
5
Excellent service, food and experience. We never expected that we would be able to taste the different food. This experience showed us that we usually taste with our eyes first and our tongue second. It's also nice to share a meal without the disturbance of the surrounding environment and all the devices we carry. It allows us to tunnel our attention to each other and to the excellent food served by some amazing and friendly staff. They change their menu every month... That's definitely a place to visit again.
5
The overall experience was awesome. The staff service was excellent, the food was amazing. It was a one of kind experience where you can heightened your senses and enjoy every inch of the food you eat, plus you get to spend quality time with your companions since there are no distractions such as phones.
5
I was recommended to Nox by a friend and was pleasantly surprised by the food and very attentive and prompt service they offered, even from their wait staff who were visually impaired. Forget your distracting mobiles, and focus on the tantalising food with different textures and tastes; some so familiar yet so tough to guess them right. Our conversations inevitably revolved around the food we were eating. Be prepared to guess wrong yet be pleasantly surprised by what you have had after your dinner. Not for the budget hunters ($100+/pax), but certainly value for money on the whole. Would certainly recommend my friends and family to experience "darkness" with Nox and awaken their other senses, especially their taste buds. My girlfriend and I had a great time here. Thank you Nox for the experience! :
5
Excellent dining experience! Not only is service immaculate, the food is outstanding! Loved the whole "pitch black" dining experience. Be amazed at how sensitive your taste buds will be without your sense of sight and that'll mean the flavor explodes in your mouth! no hand phones too so you really get to have quality time with your friends/partner. Definitely one of my best dining experience. Highly recommend
5
It was a very unique dining experience that really makes an impression. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable. As you walk up the staircase to the main dining area, the light fades and it becomes pitch black. It was a little dis-orientating at first but the visually impaired waiters were like ninjas navigating in the darkness and they were so helpful and friendly that they make you feel at ease right away. Each different course has four different varieties served in individual bowls on a larger plate. It was really a tricky treat for the taste buds! I would really recommend that you order the bottle of water, because the waiters will then ask you to pour it into your own glass, and that was more challenging than I expected! I also liked the big reveal at the end where the staff let you take a questionnaire on what you ate before showing you pictures of what you really ate…..it was surprising…Overall two thumbs up! I would really recommend this experience to everyone!
5
The service at NOX was very excellent. They were warm, welcoming and very prompt. From the moment we entered we were briefed on what was to come and how to prepare for an exciting night ahead.Went with a good friend of mine, just of figuring out how to complete simple tasks in the dark was an interesting challenge. The food-guessing was the most interesting, and the food was really good and special because they combined food that we don't usually 'see' being cooked together. Turns out the new flavour combinations were great. :)At first we thought the experience would be some what unnerving but it all proved to be safe and fun. Our visually-handicapped guide was very reassuring and helped us along the way. :)Would definitely visit again as they change their menu periodically. Thanks NOX

There are, i think, about a dozen restaurants in the world that offer this experience, so I could not pass it up on my trip to Singapore. Eating high quality, expertly prepared food without any form of visual clues is a bit disconcerting, though the staff here are so kind and helpful I soon got over it. I'm not sure if using only smell, taste and texture clues makes you enjoy the food more, but it does make the experience different, and it's a difference well worth experiencing. Part of the "gimmick" is to try to guess what you're eating, and I got quite a few things right, but I gave up partway through--just as well, as i found out what i thought was chicken was actually pig's ear. The food wasn't particularly exotic, but it was very good. They were also good about making substitutions--I'm not picky, but I just hate flatfish, so they made me some kind of chickpea dish. This was an amazing experience that I strongly recommend, though the downside is the price. I had a cocktail with the appetizer, a bottled water and the two glass wine option, which boosted my tab to over S$150

You tend to criticize your surroundings once you enter a restaurant. Of course apart from the food, you also want to have a good ambiance, with a good view, relaxing music, and the list goes on. But for this experience, its beyond what you are expecting from a good restaurant. Because obviously, its pitch black when you go the dining area. All your senses are hightened, because more than anything,you dont want to trip. You just anticipate everything! What food will be served, what does it taste, how does it smell, whats the texture. Its like fear factor in a good twist. Rama, our server, is just superbly inspiring. Before going to the main area, he reminded us to appreciate our eyesight.And yes we will after that experience. Its all worth it. Pretty expensive, but you are just served by a very friendly and customer oriented staff. Well done

Aldus Huxley was temporarily blind for about a year. He wrote about what it is to be blind in his book 'Eyeless in Gaza'. But reading about being blind, and experiencing it, are two different things. Nox is as near you can come to the experience.Located in the corner shophouse on Beach Road, Nox is modest on the outside, as it is within. The grond floor reception and bar are dimly lit, perhaps to aclamatise its patrons to what is to follow. We ordered our drinks here, but asked them to be served at the table.The young lady at the reception explained that we would be led up the stairs to an upstairs dining room, where we would be served a three course dinner in complete dark. We had specified our diet preferences when we made our reservations on telephone- but one of our members decided to switch from a no beef, no pork non-vegetarian meal to a pure vegetarian one, and they were happy to accommodate the change with a smile.We had apprehensions about the experience, in case one of us wished to use the toilets- which are on ground floor- but we were assured that some one would lead us down form the upstairs dining area, if necessary.We were met at the bottom of the stairs by Heleem, a blind waiter, who asked us to stand one behind the other, each touching the shoulders of the person in front, as he lead us up the darkening stairs.The darkness increased with each step. When we reached the top, it was almost completely dark. And by the time he led us to our table, it was pitch dark. After helping us to be seated, he explained the layout of the table- where the fork & spoon and water glass were placed, and how the meal to follow would be served in three courses- starters, main course, and dessert. He said we would be served by Ice, a blind waitress.As we waited, giggling nervously at each others' not so funny jokes, the first course arrived- it consisted of four small bowls, each with a different starter. The bowls were placed on the individual turntables, which we could easily rotate, and we were asked to eat the course clockwise; starting from the 6'o'clock bowl, and working to the 9'o'clock bowl and onwards. The same with the Main course, and the dessert. Everything was done in pitch dark.At the end of the meal, Haleem told us a little about himself: how he was a stewart with an international airline, and how while undergoing surgery for a brain tumor, he lost his vision, and how, with his parents' support, he started a new life, met the young lady who is now his wife, and found this job.Truly a profile in courage- a triamph of the human spirit.After dinner, we were led down to the lobby, where the dim lights seemed unnaturally bright. We were given a response sheet to fill. We were asked to guess the food we ate, and except for one unforgivable mistake of thinking that the shreaded duck was lamb, we guessed the beef, pork, fish etc. correctly. The desserts were easy enough,but the starters were extremely difficult to guess.They then showed us the actual photos of the meal we ate, which looked nothing like what we imagined.It was a unique dinner experience

The best is the experience, definitely one of the best dining experiences I've ever had.Food is great but maybe a bit to heavy specially for ladies.Some of the dishes are really really good.Thanks for bringing this experience to Singapore!Been twice and I'll be back to experience it again with family and close friends.The price is high but if you think this guys are helping / giving jobs to blind people, than is very fair price

On a recent trip to Singapore celebrating my husband's 50th birthday, I made a booking at this restaurant, as I had wanted to try this concept of dining in the dark for some time. I made my booking about 3 months ahead, as we were only in Singapore for a few days. We were greeted by friendly staff, who explained the concept and instructed us to remove all articles that produced light (including glow in the dark watches) and you place these in a locker. Cocktails are served downstairs and you make the decisions on your drinks to accompany your meal here as well. You can choose from their wine list or a recommended partnering of wines, we chose the later and had no complaints.The wait staff are visually impaired and we had Halemi (??), who had a great sense of humor and we got along very well together. Before he lost his sight through an accident, he was a steward for an airline. Halemi was very instructive as to how we made our way to our table, how to be seated and where we could find things on our table. It was all very exciting and a really unique sharing experience. We were at an earlier sitting (6.30pm) so the restaurant wasn't completely full, that we found a benefit, as towards the end of our meal, more clients could be heard laughing and chatting, and we felt a little more self conscious when we were laughing etc. Only a passing thought, it didn't deter from our experience overall. Each course (entree, main & desert) has 4 tastes of each. These are served in small dishes (about 6cm by 6cm), with a different dish in each one. It is with some excitement and lots of discussion that you decide what each dish is (12, 3, 6, 9 o'clock) or could be. My husband eats considerably faster than me, and I had to make him slow down to taste each dish carefully.It was lots of fun when after the meal was completed, we wrote down what we thought each dish was and then the staff reveal photos of the dishes. From wo to go it took about 2 hours for the experience. They change the menu every 6-8 weeks.Whilst I did enjoy the experience, and the dining was definitely fine dining, I felt it was a little pricey for the amount of food you got. If it was a little cheaper it would be more likely to encourage return visits, rather than being crossed off your bucket list and not revisited. The cocktails were good, but found that there was too much ice. My cocktail was like a snow cone and just a small amount of the actual drink, that I finished in 3 mouthfuls, and then the rest was ice, all this for $18.Overall we had a great time and a unique experience, but don't expect to do this again at this cost

Yes, its pitch black. No, you don't have to worry about spilling food on yourself. No, you don't have to memorise the menu before you enter the restaurant. Yes, its a truly worthwhile and unique experience.Please go here if you get the chance..if I say anymore it will ruin the surprises and fun!

Been curious for a long time about blind dining concepts before they came to Singapore. When I heard NOX opened up here, I knew I'd have to take my husband there soon - hence the table reservation became a part of my Christmas present for him! Though I must admit I was a little hesitant initially as I have never been fond of darkness but on the contrary, we were feeling comfortable in the dark! Absolutely wonderful experience and I think everyone should try it at least once. Love it

If you never tried eating in total darkness, you haven't taste totally yet. And the conversation that takes place is unbelievable. :D

Dining in the dark, WOW what an experience.I was not expecting it to be this dark. It is PITCH BLACK, you cannot see a thing.It was fun to try and guess what types of food we were eating, I really could not tell. They do some wicked cocktails.Great service and food was pretty good.It was quite expensive circa $300 SGD for two people we had two cocktails each. But well worth the experience. Having said that I would probably not do it again as I do like to see what Im eating

My wife and I wanted a unique place to celebrate our anniversary which Nox does gives us a unique experience. To be truthful, I had no ideas what I was consuming. No doubt the food taste good. Just that the fun that night is supposed to use your "suddenly acute" senses to discover what food really taste like. My wife enjoys it alot but wasn't too impressed with the price. I was slightly claustrophobic but feel that the price is reasonable. Guess Nox is rather hard to rate as it is important to decide beforehand what do you hope to bring from the experience. I recommend that you should go, with the understanding that you might be uncomfortable without seeing. Do let yourself immerse into the atmosphere and learn more about your other senses. (we have 5, remember?)Lastly, being in the dark allows a certain romance between loved ones. Since no one can see, "permitted" outrage of modesty is on the card. Just be gentle because you do not want accident

My dining partner and I had an amazing dining experience at NOX in Singapore. Eating in complete darkness - no light at all - really makes you question the tastes and textures of food you thought you knew so well. Nox does a degustation of 3 courses, each course with 4 different dishes - or plates - to try. You fumble a bit with the utensils (my partner cheated and used his hands, after all, who can tell and judge him? hehe) - but after a while you get used to feeling about for forks and your water glass. It's is massive fun - and while you can hear other diners, you really really cant see a thing. The food was good but not amazing - this is afterall, a dining in the dark experience, not famed for its masterpiece plates, but go there with an adventurous heart and a good attitude and you will have heaps of fun. The attendants and servers were lovely and will make you feel comfortable. There are also lockers, so don't worry about your valuables being snatched away in the dark!! :

I stumbled across this restaurant when I was told the Singapore Flyer was going to be closed on Valentines Day. I email them to explain I wanted to propose to my lady. With 24 hours I had a reply saying they were willing to help me and how did I want to do it.I explained in detail and had a banner sent to them from England. They kept in contact and told me the banner had arrived and did I want them to look at it so we knew it was ok. Again another quick response.The greeting at the desk was warm and welcoming, our waitress in the lounge was very pleasant and had a beaming smile.The meal and directions by the waiter in the pitch black room was amazing, this needs to be done by everyone, trying to find the food was fun and trying not to drop your glass of the edge of the table was also amusing.Trying to guess the food was great, although we didnt do very well at that it was the best food I had eaten in Singapore.The whole experience of trying to organise the proposal to eating and drinking was the best thing ever, they were very responsive with a great customer focused attitude..So to all at NOX Dine in the Dark (especially Rachel) both myself and Jirapat thank you very much for the experience and hopefully see you again soon.Paul and Jirapa

Great cocktails, excellent service and unique experience. Unfortunately, terrible food. I spent $100 on dinner and left hungry and slightly nauseated. The restaurant does not provide a menu and you do not get to select what you are paying to eat. They ask if you have any allergies or religious restrictions, which I do not. But, given that patrons get no choice in the selections, I'd assumed the meal would consist of relatively mainstream dishes. What I got instead was 4 bowls of animal fat and organs, which would not appeal to me in the dark or the light. And had I known that was what they served, I would not have gone in the first place. I think the restaurant should do a better job of letting people know what they might be eating or give them a range of options, if they want to preserve the surprise element. It was really frustrating to spend so much money, on a special occasion dinner, and not be able to eat any of my entree - literally. One bowl of beef fat, one bowl of pork fat, one bowl of foie gras (which I find cruel and disgusting) and one bowl of sweetbreads (cheek glands from a cow). And, my husband had gone to great lengths to arrange this special night out for us so I didn't want to ruin it by complaining to the staff in front of him, but I hope this review will help others make a more informed decision before eating there. The staff were very friendly and it was a unique experience, but at the end of the day it is still a restaurant and the food, in my opinion, was very disappointing

We went for the dinner at Nox as a group of hospitality professionals and it is never an easy game to entirely please us. Some of us were chefs and some experienced gourmets...We all truly enjoyed the cocktails while waiting to be brought into the dark room. We thought it was an interesting concept of having 4 small dishes for each course and trying to guess ingredients was not too difficult for us.There were some hickups with the service (which in the dark can be rather uncomfortable) but nevermind that.The funny part was after the meal in the lounge when a pretentious gentleman with a dutch/belgian accent ( I am from Europe, wohoho) was explaining us what was it that we were actually eating...To make it funnier (NOT), they put us together with another two couples - one of which was hyper active and super competitive and had to win the contest of guessing the ingredients down to the grams of salt in each dish. The other one couldnt care less and were hoping to move over to the next stage of their date.I wont spoil the surprise what were the actual ingredients of the meal but I will tell you what - there were things in the same dish that only a blind chef with no taste buds AND none whatsoever coulinary experience would ever get an idea of putting together. Which would be fine if that is what they go for. But if everybody tells you it was a brownie and you tell us it was a chocolate fondant...... My alarmbells would be ringing loud. It was a damn overcooked fondant if that is what the chef was indending.The pictures of the dishes we saw often truly had nothing to do with what we had. But we smiled and nodded and watched the competitive lady go crazy proving her often wrong points.Anyways, the saddest part was when he did not know the pronounciation of a french ingredient or a very well known japanese cooking method/sauce.... That is when I switched off and stopped listening. Seriously? You want to teach me things about creative cooking but do not know how to spell Teriyaki......Good luck.Did we have fun? YESWould we come back? NODo I reccommend this to you? If you are Singaporean looking for new experience - YESYou are just passing through Singapore and can try other blind restaurants elsewhere - NO NO NO pleas

Very fun and interesting. You are led up to the first floor restaurant by a guide/ waiter. Kudos to them, they do a great job and are very attentive.You get 3 courses, each of which consists of 4 bowls of food. It is really interesting trying to guess what you are eating based on the smell, texture and taste. Tips:1. Do go for the wine pairing2. Use all your senses. 3. Try and remember each component that you are eating. (e.g. dont just think 'chicken'; think 'fried chicken with cucumber salad and potatoes')4. Don't eavesdrop ... It may be tempting to listen in on other people that have finished the meal... resist!At the end of the meal, you will be shown what you have eaten. Prepare to be surprised! And prepare to change the way you eat and appreciate food. I was surprised that in spite of my sweet tooth, I did not enjoy the desserts as much as I thought I would... Don't get me wrong, Nox served delicious desserts, I just realised that my enjoyment was very visual

This was a very entertaining evening. To start with the food is excellent where each course is made up of 4 dishes (for 12 in all). The enteratainment came from trying to figure out what you're eating. It really does cause you to call upon your alternate senses. Obviously smell comes into play along with taste, but your sense of touch through the texture of the food as you eat, really becomes important (scallop or abalone? chicken or duck?). It made for a great evening, of very intimate conversation, fun and laughter. I'll be back for sure

I've seen such dining experience in movie and once I knew it is available in Singapore, I immediately asked a friend of mine to go with me. The reservation was made for 8.30pm but we weren't seated immediately, we waited at the bar and ordered some very unique cocktails which we were pleasantly surprised. Once the table is ready, we were led to our seats upstairs in complete darkness. We were dizzy at first but adopted fairly quickly. We had to feel our way to the cutlery and drinks. Conversing without looking into each other's eye really requires the one skill that we lack of - listening. We left our mobile in the locker room downstairs and the whole dinner went on uninterrupted. I couldn't remember the last time I had dinner without my date looking at and checking the mobile devices every few minutes.The 3-course meal was served in a combination of 4 different starters/mains/desserts. The foods were excellent and rich in flavor. I'm quite a food neophobic myself, I found the whole experience to be challenging and exciting at the same time. My friend and I had fun guessing the ingredient in the food and we were asked to fill a questionnaire at the end of the session. We were blown off when the maÃ®tre d revealed the answer and showed us the pictures. While doing that, try their signature "Skippy Dip", a cocktail mixed with peanut butter. Tip: Do go in a small group, we felt that we were closely attended to. Unlike other dining-in-the-dark experience where you were led by waiter/waitress who wear night vision goggle, ours was Halimi, who was only visually impaired 10 years ago. Throughout the dinner, he kept checking if we were satisfied with the food or the pitch-dark environment, and remembered us by name, which I think it's very professional with a personal touch.The whole experience was much more than just dining in the dark, but also to understand the visually impaired persons who live in our society and to appreciate all of our senses. It's an experience worth trying. I will be showing another friend of mine to NOX who is visiting Singapore this April

Wonderful food, world class service, great cocktails and an absolutely memorable and unique experience. You will love 'dining in the dark' - make sure you experince this.

We were curious with the concept so decided to give this resto a try.I would recommend any foodie to experience blind dining once. You really won't see a thing and would have to rely on all your other senses to savour the food.The pros:- interesting experience- attentive waiter (when he's around)- you can get competitive figuring out (and remembering) what's in the dishes- good variety (you get to try 12 dishes in small portions - 4 each for entree, mains, dessert)- chef seems fond of truffle oil (it was in at least 3 dishes :) )and cons:- long wait to get seated- average-tasting food- it will be very troublesome if you find yourself needing to go to the bathroom during the meal- you will likely use your bare hands to feed yourself despite the availability of a spoon and fork. No, I don't remember them giving a knife. You need to tear meat with your teeth in the dark or ingest slightly larger than bite-sized chunks.- and of course, those who eat with their eyes are in for a disappointmentTips- inform them before heading upstairs if you have any food restrictions or preferences so they can make the necessary adaptations (I usually separate visible fat from my meats - this is impossible in this situation. And there will be fat.)- take a cocktail from downstairs - if you order bottled drinks upstairs (including water), you need to be very careful not to spill or knock things over when refilling your glassThey apparently change their menu every month. Cost without cocktails comes up to over SGD 100 per head

A very unique experience to have, my daughter booked at Nox as a surprise for myself and her hubby and only told us the concept on arrival at the restaurant so I was a little nervous and apprehensive but when my daughter explained that to the staff they could not have been more reassuring and helpful. We enjoyed a raspberry cocktail downstairs before being led upstairs by our visually impaired waiter Halimi, we were carefully seated at our table and directions were given for our cutlery and drinks. The entrÃ©e arrived and consisted of 4 small bowls of very tasty morsels which we then had to identify this led to great discussions on what it could be. My daughter was very well taken care of as she suffers a shellfish allergy and dishes were modified to keep her safe. The mains arrived another 4 bowls of tasty food to be eaten clockwise starting at 6 o'clock. Then 4 more dishes of lovely deserts were enjoyed. All too soon the night was over and we were led downstairs to fill in a form with our perceptions on what we had enjoyed. Overall we did quite well with the mains and deserts but found the entrees tricky to identify as we had never eaten things like eel, truffle and abalone before. We found all of the items very tasty and there was not one item I did not like and was very glad that sight and knowledge did not cloud my judgment on what I had savored eating. Definitely an experience to embrace
5
Definitely one of the most memorable meals I've ever had in a restaurant. The food is all excellent, and the experience is enriched by the fat that you eat in complete blackness, so your sense of taste is enhanced. A must do
1
Actually the only thing you can think is true are the cocktail and the appetizer than they will give you when you are waiting to be set in your table.My experience was a very unhappy dinner where the food was served in 4 different containers per dish, the service was even worst than the food, we ordered two different bottles of wine and imagine to eat in the dark and you cannot see nothing and they didn't ask you if you want more wine or anything, they just bring the food and done, you eat it in less than 5 minutes per dish because is baby food in 4 pots and you still spend two hours having your dinner. after the two hours was so late than they even didn't show us what we ate as they do with the rest of the customers.150 bucks per head (group of 7) for a terrible and desperate night in the dark

Hi, I'd like to commend the blind staff that kindly served us and helped us to our tables. They were very accommodating and friendly. So thank you for your professional effort. You guys were lovely. With limited days in Singapore, after reading reviews, I very much looked forward to flying over from Australia to what sounded like a very fun & different dining experience, at the Nox Dine In the dark, in Singapore. I made reservations online and typed up in full detail, our dietary requirements as a couple celebrating an early birthday that night. I then received an email response from a staff, prompting that they have noted down our dietary requirements and that a complimentary birthday cake, would be presented to us, after our dine in the dark experience. I had booked weeks in advance, so closer to the date I received an sms to my phone to personally return and make a phone call to Nox itself, to confirm that my reservations was still valid. I called, and again, I noted and spoke of all our dietary requirements as well as the surprise complimentary birthday cake for my partner that Nox had confirmed earlier via email. The staff on the other side of the phone confirmed that all requested was noted. Glad to speak to the staff at Nox and confirm everything again over the phone. All was good. On the night we arrived, to cut it short it.. they were not thoroughly prepared for us. (dietary food requirements-wise). They left out the pork and seafood that my partner could have eaten, and there was no surprise birthday cake at the end as promised via email and over the phone. We ended up eating what seemed like the same meal as everyone else around us, but without the seafood, pork or chicken that my partner could have eaten (as I stated earlier via email and phone) ... that we saw at the end of our meal on their ipad touch. On the ipad, we got to see photos of what we ate. We left pretty hungry. The food was plain and average and highly priced for what we received. You'd pay for the experience. If you have a lot of time in Singapore and you have no dietary requirements then you might enjoy it. It's quite a newish establishment that recently opened on Singapore I think.... hence the hiccup we received ... As a foodie I would not return.

Hubby and I went for date night in Saturday night. We were so intrigued at the concept of dining in the dark and the reality far exceeded our expectations!Excellent service throughout the experience - from welcome, through dinner and until we left. We were guided through the whole process - very slick but also friendly and welcoming.Started out with amazing raspberry vodka cocktails in the bar - had to have two (which I later regretted when I realized I needed the loo during dessert).We were literally led upstairs by our waiter into a pitch black dining room, seated at our table and guided through the table lay out.3 courses of lovely food followed - again we were led through what to expect (4 small bowls of different dishes for each course) and what order to eat the dishes. The food really was wonderful - beef cheek, cod, pork belly, confit duck leg, truffled pasta, scallops, chocolate fondant, macaroons, coconut sorbet and pannecotta.Was weird not being able to see a thing but it made me and my hubby talk to each other throughout the whole meal (I normally get distracted by people watching which is impossible at Nox!)It also made us really taste and as our every dish. We both ate sweetbreads and enjoyed them (we had no clue what the dish was only that it tasted delicious). So I have now eaten the thyroid glands of a cow...At the end of the meal you are led back down to the bar where you are given a little questionnaire to fill out - asking you to guess what you just ate. Then the lovely staff show you the dishes on an iPad so you finally get to see what you ate.Amazing concept - will be recommending to all my friends :

You really must try this. Fab cocktails, excellent food, a good laugh....a great night. You won't be disappointed. A totally different dining experience. Thoroughly recommended
5
Boyfriend and I went to NOX yesterday for his 24th birthday dinner. It was definitely one of our favorite restaurant we've ever had. We were well served as soon as we stepped in to the restaurant. The concept of the restaurant was amazing and needless to say the food was AWESOME!! Our waiter Halimi was very nice and we were sorry to know that he lost his sight 10 years ago, but his positivity inspired me. I will not hesitate to go back to NOX again and would like to thank NOX for the great experience
5
We went to NOX for our new years eve dinner and we're blown away. It was one of the most amazing experiences. The ambience of the bar and then the entire concept was amazing. The food was incredible and they clearly have some amazing chefs. Our host / waiter Halimi added a lot of sparkle to our dining. A hugely positive person, very upbeat and fun host albeit visually impaired. He was an inspiration. Nox thank you for making our new year's eve so so special. We couldn't have chosen a more special venue for our special day. Thank you!

It has always been on my to-do list to dine in total darkness as I thought it would be pretty interesting to dine without using the sense of sight. Hence, I jumped with excitement when I first learnt that Nox has finally introduced this dining in the dark concept to our shores and I was certainly not disappointed. I enjoyed how Nox incorporated a guessing game at the end of our dinner, where you had to guess the ingredients that went into our meals and there was a session to reveal the answers. In addition, the fact that no mobile phones or any devices were permitted in the dining area also meant we had the luxury of attention to focus on having a good conversation, something that is hard to come by where we are often distracted with modern technology. Food-wise: I'm no food critic but I must say I enjoyed the feast. Small portions but it was sufficient for female eaters like me. I'll certainly recommend this hidden gem to everyone - locals and tourists alike and I know i will be back for another unique dining experience in 2014

Having gastric problems, i still made my way to nox after having cancelled a few times. Entering the restaurant, we were greeted by friendly and professional staff who carefully explained what we were going to expect. After about half hr of chit chatting, we were ushered by a visually impaired waiter to our dining table. Being pitch dark, i felt very uncomfortable in the beginning but u soon get adjusted to the environment.Our visually impaired waiter, a guy called, rahamat was excellent and quickly made sure we were OK. 4 starters, 4 mains and 4 desserts. We had a superb time guessing the food and is proud to say we got all the starters and dessert correct. Unfortunately, we got 2 meats in the mains wrong. Service was quick and efficient. We finished dinner in an hrs plus and headed down for the mini quiz and answers to what we ate in the pitch dark room revealed!Bill came up to 200+ for 2 of us with 1 glass of wine and a coke - pricey but definitely worth every bitOne on my more enjoyable dining experiences in Singapore after 2 years of working here! And will definitely recommend this to everyon
5
Incredible! The food alone was amazing but the opportunity to really get in touch with your senses and appreciate life was a once in a lifetime experience. I was touched by the story of our visually impaired waiter and it was fun to try and guess what you were eating. I highly recommend this experience
5
The food was incredible and the wine pairings were very nice. My husband was almost frightened to try this, but after his first taste he was fine. I liked it so much I am going to bring my family when they come to visit
4
Had a great time dining at Nox. It is a very strange sensation eating in the dark but our waiter (manny) was superb and put us at ease. The food was good and tasty but a little bit on the pricey side. Altogether a great idea and I highly recommend a visit if you are on the lookout for the spectacular and different dining experience
5
The service was totally impeccable. We were totally appalled. Because christmas is just days away, the meal was whipped up with the theme surrounding christmas. The food was very well done, just that I am picky and very selective with my food. I find that some of the dishes were very rich in flavours (I prefer bland) and very intriguing. We were totally clueless about what we were having before and during the meal. Only when we were led to the bar with lights, the server then explained to us with photos. Extremely interesting concept.The servers in the dark room are actually visually impaired. It was a total irony that we need the blind to lead us. Through the 1.5hr experience, we felt how it was to be "visually impaired". The short span of time definitely made us more appreciative of our sight and not to take it for granted. Our physical stomach and soul were filled to the bream. Will definitely recommend this place
5
Me and my wife went down for our anniversary on the 14th of December. When we stepped into the restaurant, we were greeted by your staff which were extremely polite and explained the dining concept to us clearly. Waiting time prior to being lead to our table was reasonable with a complimentary appetizer which was delightful. We were lead up the stairs by visually impaired waiter. He lead us up with great care. Upon reaching the second level, we were amazed by the complete darkness except for the red dot which we presumed it was a IR security camera. The food was above our expectation and with the temporary loss of sight, we felt that our sense of smell and taste increase to compensate it... We could truly enjoy our dishes, with the fun part of guessing the food that is served to us. In addition, we were able to spend quality time with one another without any disturbances such as our hand phone. Likewise being not able to see who seats adjacent to your table also allowed us to talk freely.The overall experience was great for us. We learnt the importance of sight and also would like to truly thank the waiters which did great serving us.We will definitely drop by again
5
The reviews by others are quite accurate. We were given a warm welcome by a very helpful staff and given a nice overview of what to expect. I must admit that the food was average, but you don't come for that.You are guided to your seats up the stairs in a totally dark room by very attentive waiters. It is my understanding that they are blind, but they were incredibly hospitable and assisted us in acclimating to this unique experience. Each of the 3 courses consisted of a variety of food served in four small bowls. You will need to use your other senses to determine what you have eaten and at the end of the meal you would need guess what you have eaten. I would not recommend this if you are afraid of the dark and if you are a vegetarian. Although they do accommodate non meat eaters, they only provide seafood as an option. I would happily go again with friends visiting Singapore!
5
There are many wonderful things about this restaurant. The staff and service was great, very friendly and informative. Eating in pitch darkness is an amazing experience. Your senses become heightened, and we quickly adapted to putting our knives and forks, and wine glasses, in exactly the same place each time so that we could find them again easily. How the staff were able to serve us in complete darkness was a wonder - but I suppose they are used to that. The sense of smell was especially strong - when a glass of wine was put down you could smell it immediately. As for the food, i did find it hard to tell all of the foods and flavours, and I eat out a lot. It appears that seeing food first does make a difference to the flavour. It may be better to give you the option to know what you are eating first, to give you mind a chance to prepare you for the food
5
I ate at Nox and loved the cocktails, the food and the experience. You should read the FAQs on their website to orient yourself but yes, it really is pitch black and you have to feel around for your wine glass because you can't see it. The food is excellent and you end up with 12 small plates, so I was stuffed by the end. The pacing of the meal was good and my waiter was very professional. You don't know what you are eating until they take you back down to the lit bar, but that was a good bit of the fun. I was there on my own but there were also couples or groups. This was a really great experience and I would advise locals and tourists both to give it a try. It is about a 15 minute walk from the Bugis MRT and easy to find if you follow the map on their website

My husband and I dined at Nox for our wedding anniversary, visiting Singapore from Australia. The entire experience was amazing, from the service, to the cocktails, our amazing host and not forgetting the delicious food. The concept although at first seemed quite confronting, was comfortable and gave us the opportunity to experience eating on a whole different level. Loved that we then got to try to work out what we ate and then we were shown what we ate. Highly recommend this experience to anyone who likes to step outside their comfort zone..

After having read the excellent reviews about this restaurant my wife and I were very much looking forward to dining here.Whilst we both applauded the concept behind the restaurant we were extremely disappointed about the whole experience.We found the food to be very bland and although we had reminded the restaurant in advance by phone call from the UK that my wife only ate vegetarian and fish - the choice was very poor and there was no way of knowing what she actually ate - Similarly I also felt that my food was not as eventually described. In our honest opinion the food was very overpriced for small portions of essentially amuse bouche which if served up in a " seeing environment" would be roundly condemned as both unimaginative and poor value for money.I have entitled the review as "Emperor's New Clohes" as I believe that the restaurant has been hyped up! Our expectaions were not met at all and I would certainly not recommend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for either great food or a really superb experiience.I cannot understand the high levels this restaurant achieves

The food was absolutely fantastic and it's definitely the top quality ingredients that make all the difference :)More importantly is the experience that I've taken away. I've never really thought about what it would be like to be visually impaired and dining in the dark is just simply a wonderful eye-opening experience. You can really focus on the taste of each dish and it' so different from everyday dining where you just eat for the sake of filling your stomach. The skill of each of the waiters was impeccable and the service was incredible especially to manoeuvre around in the dark (which would be normal everyday life for them!). Thank you NOX for making my 1 year anniversary with my boyfriend so, so amazing

Heard about this place through word of mouth and thought it was a perfect opportunity to give my friend a treat at. I did spend time reading up on what other diners thought about this place. In the end, I went for it for the experience and I sure did get an experience. Its no joke when they said pitch-black. You could hardly see a thing. You have to trust your visually challenged host to guide you. I went in all excited and once I settled down in the dark, thoughts started to run through my mind on whats happening around me. The other diners seem to be calmly having their dinner and it made me think if I was the only one who could not see. Do not worry, I was not having a panic attack and since I was there with a friend, we could keep reassuring ourselves that everything was fine.For the food, it was 3 course with 4 mini dish each. It was a different perspective to the way we consume our food. The smell, taste and even the sound makes a difference to the experience. It was a guessing game on what we were eating and at the end of the dinner, the staff would reveal the food to us. This place made me eat stuff that I would not normally eat and I have to say it didn't taste that bad. (So mom has to blindfold me now). When you are done with one course, just wait and reflect and they would bring out the next one in time.As for the price, I would say its on the...pricier part of the scale. One turn off was the part where a group of diners were chatting and laughing out loud. It was distracting to the point where some people were shushing them (I joined in too). I also felt something was missing in the whole experience. I cant seem to put my finger at it. Our host could have been more interactive. I was calling his name out a couple of times before he responded. So there could be a better system to grab their attention. I do not want to go to the part of fire hazards or emergencies but hope they have a clear instructions of what to do in an emergency before dinner

We visited NOX - Dine in the Dark in December 2013 after a friend recommended we try it out. We started down stairs having a drink and a rundown on how the night is planned. You get a locker for your belongings.We were escorted upstairs by our waiter for the evening (Everyone upstairs is visually impaired). He took us to our seats, explained where everything was and how to do some of the basics (find our meal, pour drinks etc.) in pitch black.Overall, while quite pricey (especially the drinks) the experience was fantastic. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed trying to figure out what we were eating and just eating in the dark in general.I would recommend to visit with an open mind. The fun is in the attempt to figure out what you're eating and to have a night in the shoes of those who cannot see. Once you're done you get to see photos of what you ate (unless you require special dietary needs).The food was tasty, the drinks tasty, the service upstairs and downstairs all very good.I would definitely recommend you visit. For the best experience I would say no more than 6 people or you will lose the ability to talk out each meal

Living in sg, a challenging and busy country. Practically eat in a rush, without having to taste and enjoy every food you had eaten.nox is a nice and relax place to dine in.stepping into the dinning area makes me put aside all my pressure and tension.tasting all the dishes slowly in a peaceful atmosphere. Servers make me felt so welcome and heart warming moment is when they assure you that you will be safe and sound with them guiding you thru the way

Like many people who came by this theme of dining online, I find it very interesting and unique in the way that I have never try in over the past years. Hence decided to went over for this little challenge as for me personally I am super scare of pitch dark environment! I would freaked out! Still I went for this dining session with my bf and first the staffs was very nice. They make you feel at home. Having a nice strawberry cocktails (the concubine) at the waiting area really relax and throw away the day of stressful work. There is a very nice lady who I forget her name, she would explain to us on how the dinner would proceed and what do we expect in there. We be served with 3 courses but 4 dishes each. And I have also informed that I do not take beef, lamb and fish. Alright after a few minutes of waiting time, we were been told that our table is ready and we have to keep our phone in the locker( which is perfect. As now normally over the dinner we be busy playing with our own phone and have not much conversation) The host the bring us up is very nice and give us a very warm feeling! Initially I am a little freaked out due to the totally darkness. But the people and environment gave me a nice cozy feeling. We have a enjoyable and diff experience dining feel ever! And make us realise that at times we should not see thing using our eye but should depend on our rest of the senses too. Funny thing is most of the items I don't really eat coz I am super picky on food but through out the whole food serving I ate it all finish! Nice place and experience that everyone should try!

The entire experience is amazing! Went there with my boyfriend and it totally surprised us! we both love the concept of darkness and really love their good cause of hiring impaired people as their waiter. Service was excellent and the food was great! Very nice ambiance to have dinner, to be totally away from phone and just concentrating on food and conversation with your partner/friends! =D The food they serve is of good quality and very well prepared. They take in special request upon reservation but they were nice to take in last minute changes when visit on that day! Very good hospitality! =

An amazing experience and the vegetarian food was simply awesome. Every dish was perfect. The dining in the dark experience is a must as it puts things into perspective and gives you a better appreciation of how to use the other senses. Our server, halibut was a real gentlemen a and a humble guy. Go and enjoy the experience and learn to appreciate food even more. The pre dinner cocktails are very adventurous

On visiting Singapore with my two younger brothers, we booked up The Nox, what a great experience dining in the dark. The food is plentiful and of good quality and keeps you wondering until the end. Actually, it was 4 small plates per course. You've got a fork and a spoon and it's really weird to eat without seeing anything. Try ordering Rubus Pink and Pan Seared Foie Gras with Slow Cooked Egg and enjoy! Such a very interesting experience!Ya, it was quite excited not to see anything at all, if there was no sound, I would feel like I was all alone. I enjoyed the whole experience, from the lovely pre-dinner drinks to guessing the menu & eating in the dark. This dinner was not just a gimmick after all, it was a great experience and one I'll never forget

And it is dark - completely! The waiters are blind (some from birth; some acquired later in life) and are trained to serve in this pitch black environment. It is quite a humbling experience to realise the world that they live in and how difficult it must be. Starting with some very good cocktails in the (lit) bar; there is no choice apart from whether you take the wine paring with the meal or not. (You are, however, asked re food allergies. (Have no idea whether they could manage veggies as all 8/12 main starters and main dishes contained fish or meat. The wines were OK but nothing exceptional. The food itself was very good-excellent - at the end you try to work out what you have eaten (3 courses; 4 small bowls per course) - and you eat 12 completely different dishes - all different tastes and textures - and the correct answers are given (together with pictures!). It is amazing how difficult it can be to identify foods without the benefit of sight and I did eat some things that I would never have ordered from a menu!!! The actual process of eating/managing in the dark was fine.... your environment is really only a 2 foot square table with a few items on it..... and everything is "bite-sized"!Overall a really worthwhile experience. Not pricey by most standards. Booking is absolutely essential

The food at NOX appears simple, but the flavors have remarkable depth. NOX is known best for dining in the dark, first of its kind in Singapore, its new! its fresh! its the thing! and the reputation is well deserved. The place is both clean and new—despite having limited space and more customers than can fit inside at one time—and all the staff members there greeted my companions and me with smiles as warm as the food they serve there. I would thoroughly recommend NOX- Dine in the Dark to anyone whose a food lover. I know I'll certainly be returning soon.Taste : 4/5Smell : 4/5Presentation : 5/5Enjoyability eating in a restaurant 6/5!!!Atmosphere : 5/5Staff Knowledge & attentiveness : 5/5Speed of Service : 4/

It was one of the best dining place that me and my partner went to. The concept is very interesting as you will have to dine in the dark. Yes, dine in the dark! I am someone who is scared of the dark but I'm pretty surprised that I was totally comfortable while dining. So for those who are scared, don't worry! The whole dining experience was wonderful from the great service of the crew to the unique food that they served. It was very exciting for my partner and I throughout the whole dining duration and we enjoyed ourselves very very much. I admit it is a bit pricey though but nevertheless it's a must try and you will never regret going for it. They are having Christmas special starting from 10 December 2013 I think, so do visit them! Oh, and remember to reserve your seats, you wouldn't want to be disappointed doing a walk-in. Just a small note: for those who are driving, please expect parking to be a hassle. Lots are super limited so got to try your luck

A fantastic experience from beginning to end with outstanding service. I don't want to give too much away so try it and find out for yourself. Push your senses to the limit with a truly unique evening that is not to be missed

Wanted to try something different for my besties birthday, hence we decided to try a whole new level of dining. happen to know that NOX is a newly opened restaurant with a very different concept. I would say the moment I step into the restaurant, I feel nothing but warm and welcomed. And I would like to personally thanks Rahamat which is our host for that night for guiding us through the entire course. Kudos to you and the team! This is really a whole new experience whereby it really heightened our other senses. especially when you have to fill the glasses with water in the dark yourself. My taste palate has become highly sensitive and it makes me slowly devour the scrumptious dinner. Having this experience of dining in the dark has made me learn to appreciate and cherish what I have. :

Our son bought us dinner at this restaurant for my birthday and what a treat is was! It was an experience unlike anything else we've ever done and even though it was a bit scary at first, we were quickly made to feel at ease by the lovely staff there. Our waiter was amazing as he is completely blind and for obvious reasons, he made us value our eyesight. We thought the food was great and really varied and the whole concept is so unique. My son emailed to say that I don't like seafood, so they happily accommodated both non-seafood dishes for me and seafood dishes for my husband. We will definitely be going back when we're lucky enough to get back to Singapore! Thanks to all the staff for a fantastic experience

Taking the challenge for this experience was well worth it. We were both enjoyably (and entertainingly) surprised by our reactions when presented with eating 'without our eyes'. The whole evening was wonderful, from the delicious pre-dinner cocktail to the debrief at the conclusion of the night. The staff were warm, professional and competent, and it was refreshing to hear the depth of their knowledge of their own menu...something I have often found lacking here in Singapore. They could talk as knowingly about cooking methods as ingredients, and with a menu of this type and the fact it changes monthly - that's pretty good work in my books. I would go back - and take a foodie or two who like a bit of fun with me

Being not particular of food selection, myself and my lady decided to give a try. Really, it was random and we opted NOX, which we had nothing to despair. Started of with booking in for 2 pax @ 8pm and we drove out slightly earlier. Found the place easily next to Arab St and got a parking slot. We thought, it was a good start could get a slot right in front of NOX, along the main roadside. We entered and was warmly welcome by a lady, which I could not recall exactly her name that she introduced. Not knowing what to expect, we were just too excited. She led us to a table where she explains in details of what we will encounter throughout. The lobby itself is cozy with simplicity. Started of with red wine, served in no time, coupled with a some sort of crab cake ball appetizer. Lockers are avail. for safekeep belongings. She approached us back once the table ready and directed to a staircase to the dining area. We were greeted by Halimi that explained details from there onwards. Entering the dining area, pitch black, really, all we heard only patrons conversations left-right-front-back. Got sitted on our table by Halimi and introduced what was on the table, cutleries, glasses, bottles, and the meal courses. No indication of what we will have as we supposed to feel, taste and wonder. We were served with 3 courses with 4 different dishes each. It makes a lot more interesting as to taste 12 different dishes in all. Couple of times, my lady moved herself and sitted on my chair. No indications though for do's and dont's, so yeaa ;)... we enjoyed much of each other company, not seeing each other face as we normally do daily. Just hearing voice and knowing each other existence... make lots different, give a try. For once, we both felt that reality is, at times, much better than dreams. Footprints in our heart.Done all courses, we headed back down assisted by Halimi and received back at the lobby area, where there was a questionnaire to complete on the experience and on we possibly had in the course. Shared to us, a heartened stories about their associates. Yes, it is in fact inspiring. In the midst, my lady realized that one of her earring stud/fastener was missing. Nothing that matter, as both earrings were still there only one stud missing. Tried to search but to no avail. They assisted and told us that they will try to look for it at the dining area again once service is done, as they will need to on back all the lights after dinners. We left and while I was taking a ciggie, a call back from NOX, informed that they had found the stud on my chair and queried on my location. One of the male associate dashed out and handed over the stud. We conveyed our most sincere gratitude for the effort in locating back a small stud for my lady. This what made it - Astonishing. It was... the moment of truth for us. Damage: $200Location: Ease of mindFood: Surprise surpriseExperience: AstonishingPeople: Priceles

I'm quite surprised that this is No. 2 in Singapore but good for NOX. There are so many fantastic places to eat in Singapore but perhaps people really enjoy the novelty of this restaurant. If you're in Singapore for a short period of time and you are a foodie, you probably wouldn't end up here because the food isn't great. But if you're in the mood for an 'experience' then this is the place.NOX is modelled off of other dine-in-the dark experiences in the US, London and Paris (for example) however there are a few twists. Firstly, the servers are actually blind and not wearing night goggles. This is a great idea and the servers are really nice. Secondly, you have a bit more flexibility in terms of timing. Some dine in the dark experiences force everyone to arrive for fixed seatings. NOX does not which makes for a more intimate, relaxed and enjoyable experience. Also, the pre/post waiting room couldn't handle having everyone in there at once! Thirdly, the food is served in discrete pots of four for each course. The pre-dinner cocktail menu was interesting and we tried a few of them out. Service was a bit patchy but that's not surprising given it's new. The amuse bouche was nice. It was the best part of the meal. We didn't feel like ordering a bottle of wine because we thought it would be too complicated and actually, we were keen to make our way downstairs when the food was finished as opposed to linger in the dark so we were glad that we decided to order drinks before, drinks after and then just one glass of wine with dinner. The blind waiters are really sweet and it was fun to hold their shoulder and be lead up the stairs into the dark. The food was average but we had fun discussing what we thought we were eating, dropping cutlery and finding our way around the table. We also enjoyed matching up our guessing against reality over a post-dinner drink near the bar. The hostess gives you the menu to look at once you are done with your meal. Overall, it was a fun experience and the pricing was decent. It was interesting and it's worth trying

Come to try it, because it is no. 2. But we all think it is so far so good. The atmosphere is good, but when I see back the comments like marketing more than experience. It has a good restaurant , but not the best

On visiting Singapore we booked up The Nox, what a great experience dining in the dark, would recommend anyone visiting Singapore to book this unique restaurant, you won't be disappointed.

My wife and I was there on 30 Aug 2013 for a 3 course prix fixe dinner (that's the only choice). While we have heard a lot of good things about the place, this is the first time we are eating without knowing what the food is, let alone eating in the dark. The thought of spilled drinks and fallen cutlery was swimming in my head while we made our way there.Upon arrival, the maitre d' gave us a warm reception and led us to the bar for the pre-dinner drinks. Wifey chose the "Ignite My Passion", a blend of passion fruit, spices and mint (but we can't remember the alcohol). I can't remember the name of the martini I had, but we both enjoyed our drinks. This was followed by hors d’œuvre, which was light and refreshing.Having whet our appetite, our waiter was introduced to us. To our surprise, the malay gentleman was blind, but I guess that made perfect sense: he will have no problem navigating through the dining area. He gave a short introduction on what we can expect as he led us to the dining area. This was up a flight of stair to the 2nd storey, and the light along the way became progressively darker until it was pitch black. Instead of feeling scared or apprehensive, Wifey and I found it pretty amusing. We made our way to our table without tripping over or knocking over any furniture.Our waiter then explain to us that each of the 3 courses (appetiser, main course, dessert) will be made up of 4 different dishes. They will be served to us and we should taste the dish closest to us i.e. 6 o'clock and proceed to the next dish in a clockwise direction. This is important because in the end, we are to fill up a form to indicate what we think the dishes were.So as not to spill too much beans, the portions of the dishes were just nice. Most of the dishes have the right balance of taste. We were not the only ones feeling overwhelmed by the whole experience. While we were in the middle of our main course, a group of ladies sat down in the table next to us. They were so caught up in the experience that they were talking and laughing so loudly that other patrons were shushing them. They have forgotten that in the dark, our sense of hearing became enhanced and it was becoming a tad too loud. However, I found that rather amusing, hearing all the gossips.We thought we didn't take too long to finish our dinner, but when we went back down to the ground floor to fill up the survey form, we realised 90 minutes have passed. We couldn't wait to see whether our guesses for the dishes were correct because we were running late for a movie.Will we return for more? Definitely

It is definitely the most unforgettable dining experience for 3 simple reasons: a. first time we ate without seeing what we are consuming. It was a unique experience because it heightens all your other senses and makes you more aware of the surrounding. b. service was first rate. Rahaman was our assigned waiter and he makes you feel comfortable in total darkness. As it is, most of us will find it difficult to trust a total stranger, but Rahman makes you feel at ease when he guided us up the steps to our seats/ c. food was awesome. Defintely it is high on our list because its the first time we actually 'tasted' our food if you get what I mean. Normally we just rush through or talk through our meals without savouring it properly and appreciating the chef's effort in whipping up the meal. Lastly,it was a special day for us as well. It is exactly one month before we say I do to each other. Hence we wanted to dine somewhere special to celebrate. We are glad we chose this place as we will always remember this dining experience. Thanks Nox

The atmosphere, food and service is fantastic. It was my first time to dine in the dark. The assurance from the host made the whole dining experience memorable. He guides us from the moment we were going up the stairs, into pitch dark, giving clear instructions. When it comes to the food, the serving, quality, is perfect. It is really full flavor and unexpected. It allows us to fully use our taste bud to determine what is put in our mouth and I bet you will be caught by surprise.
5
We went to Nox on the way back to the UK whilst spending a few days in Singapore. To keep it short I had a minor "oh crap moment" when you realise it really is completely pitch black! After finding your seat (and sitting on it which is a feat!) you start to feel comfortable and enjoy the experience. The food is plentiful and of good quality and keeps you wondering until the end. The water Rahaman was absolutely brilliant and as they can't see the table I feel you get much more attentive service whilst not feeling rushed.Would recommend the restaurant to all although its not the cheapest but your going for the experience

"robertsn6534" says it all.....!!!!It's exactly what had happened and i love everything about it. It's a great experience and i'll go back there again to try their new menu. They change their menu every 4th or 6th week. The food is good and what i learned about myself is that i'm a lousy taster. I couldn't tell which is which or what i'm eating.....but i got to tell you, it's delicious and i think i cleaned up every bowl that goes to my mouth....!!! That's how Halimi thought us how to eat in the dark as we can't see anything and we didn't want to spill anything. I'm really like to thanks Nox giving equal opportunity to the visually impaired. Halimi served us and i think he inspired both of us. Thumbs Up for NOX.....!!!

Booked for 9pm. Got our table at 10pm only. We chose the only option "3 course" menu with wine pairing.The experience is fun at the beginning. Seeing nothing at all. following each other up to the kind of private room.The food came. Actually, it was 4 small plates per course. You've got a fork and a spoon and it's really weird to eat without seeing anything. But after 15-20 minutes you got the concept clear and start getting bored. Keeping a conversation with your friends without seeing them is really complicated... Try it once.So, the positive side:- The blind experienceThe "could be improved" side:- The wine was really really low end. And they serve you a sip per glass. Cherry on the cake, they served the white wine at room temperature. No joking.- The food was OK. I mean good. But we were disappointed there was no more surprising stuff with special texture and flavors. It is the level of an average restaurant of clarke quay at three times the price.- The aircon was much too strong. We complained three times. No change.- We asked for iced water as it is often proposed in Singapore. But no, they had only "still water" or "sparkling water". Business first.- Talking of business, the bill at the end was at $140/head. For this price, you can have a real culinary experience in Singapore. What we got is some average food with cheap wine.So, it you have money and got bored of normal restaurants, you could try it to do something different. Dont go in couple or for business, that wouldnt serve the purpose.A last word about the deco. I cant comment about it. But we could feel all the chairs were'nt the same, the tables didnt have tablecloth or the walls were plaster. Some details
5
The food was good but that is not the point. The point is that it's a completely different experience from anything I've ever tried. Love birds, this makes for an excellent date night

To begin with, the concept is amazing! I love the experience, our waiters Rahaman and Joseph are always excellent and I'm really excited for Nox giving equal opportunity to the visually impaired - this is really important for me. Secondly, the food is great - and the variety well well worth it! But having done this twice now I have some (hopefully constructive) criticism to share. The dining area was very loud during my October visit, to the point where Rahaman struggled with the things he had to go through with us. The bar area - same - the new hostess couldn't hear us and she stuck to her script instead of engage with us. In both aspects, September was much much better! Additionally, I was looking forward to a substantially different menu, but found that most of the dishes were slightly tweaked, e.g.change a scallop for a clam or similar (cannot say more - spoiler alert). The September visit was totally worth it because the menu was brand new, but for the October visit I felt the value for money wasn't great because I expected something substantially new. Perhaps you should consider rotating the menu every quarter and change it up more, so that our taste buds have more to look forward to. Lastly, I think that wine and alcohol takes away from the experience, and would recommend guests to skip it so that they can indulge more in the culinary creations of your wonderful chef. To end on a high note - I absolutely adore Nox and am already looking forward to my next visit!!

Our experience was so amazing I had to send a mass email to my colleagues the day after, that everyone had to try this at least once! :)I had a couple of them asking me about the experience, but I couldn't comprehend it in exact words.And that's the beauty about dining at NOX, you have to experience this, no one can simply understand how it is to dine blind.The food was exceptional, and the service, impeccable.It was the priciest meal I've had with my friend, cos I paid for both.However, it was worth every cent, and truly a small tiny price to pay for the priceless experience you get.It was perfect, from start to finish. And they even send you a thank you email the day after, remembering what you have enjoyed.Kudos to you guys

It was with much anticipated excitement to know that I was gonna be dining at Nox. My partner and I arrived on time for our dinner reservation where we were briefed on what to expect and were seated to chill at the lounge area with their highly raved cocktails available for ordering, which did not disappoint. I'm partial to the concubine. About 30 minutes later, we were being informed that our host and table were ready. By than, we have already used the restroom as recommended since there won't be any available at the 2nd level dining area and we also deposited all our belongings into one of the many lockers provided. No mobile phones and any items that emit light were allowed. Both of us were paired to head up with 2 other diners and after a mini introduction with our host, we formed a human train up the stairs and into the darkness. After we were being seated at our table, we were being asked to familiarize ourselves to it and the host notified us of where our cutlery and cup was and how we should be eating our way around when the food was being served. The complete darkness needed a bit of getting used to but it didn't take too long as we feel our way around the table, and as we ordered sparkling water, we had to pour our own water into our cups. It was pretty cool for me to know how fast I could ease into the dark surroundings and pour my own water into the cup without spilling any. The 3 course dinner was being served shortly and our server will always place the plate right in front of us. We were to start eating from our 6 o'clock and go clockwise to complete a round. We were not told what the appetizers, mains and desserts were at first. So both of us had quite a bit of fun eating and guessing what we were putting into our mouths with temporary heightened senses. The food wasn't exceptionally fantastic but it was good enough for me and rather than just focusing on the food itself, it was the entire 'dining in the dark' experience that made it all worthwhile. I had so much fun eating knowing the fact that there was no need to be self conscious as no one would be able to see. We were simply sniffing and eating our way messily though the 3 course dinner, with lively chattering no less.(fft: did you eat with your eyes closed/opened most of the time?)After we were done with the food, our friendly host brought us back down to the lounge area where we were made to fill up a form to make our guessing of the food we had. Answers were being revealed and it was interesting to know what were some of the exotic food we had that we thought otherwise. Would also like to thank Nox for preparing a mini surprise, knowing that it was a celebration for my birthday that night. This maiden experience was definitely a very memorable one and if you think you know your food well, you haven't tried dining in the dark. Thanks to Nox for an awesome "dark" adventure

We enjoyed every bit of the concept and experience of dining in the dark at NOX! It was a one-of-a-kind experience and I would highly recommend it. I was quite intimidated initially because i have a slight hearing deficiency but our server Halimi is one of the best I've met in my entire life. He not only managed to keep me calm especially when we were following him to our table but he explained the whole process in detail and was really hospitable. Being there with my girlfriend gave us a whole new experience altogether as it heightened our senses for alot of other things that you usually will not take notice of. It makes you keep your mind to just each other, the conversation and the food. No external distractions, no social media, no phones. It was really a quality time well spent. It's like a first date all over again. We will definitely be going back with our family and friends as I think it would give rise to a different kind of spark altogether! :)Would be nice to eventually know how the place looks like though and how we looked like while eating in the dark. Also, I felt the lounge on the first level could be more cosy, it felt kinda cold and empty. Perhaps the white light was too stark and the seating was too open, it makes strangers feel weird sitting opposite or beside each other. Music was good though

I was quite keen on trying this restaurant due to all the great reviews on tripadvisor. I was happy to find that the restaurant allowed late sittings which suited us very well. Upon entering the restaurant, we were led to a small lounge on the ground level where we were told a few house rules. All phones, wallets, loose items and bags including glow in the dark watches were placed into lockers which lined the entrance. Cocktails were only served downstairs whilst we were served the first (and only) dish we could visually see - a fried tofu canape. Once we finished the cocktails, we were introduced to our own guide for the night, a visually impaired staff called Halimi. We were led to a flight of stairs which in turn led to the upstairs 100% pitch black floor. I was asked to hold onto Halimis shoulders with two hands whilst everyone followed by holding each other's hands or shoulders. It was a little alarming at first trying to adjust to the complete darkness but once we were seated and had our drinks from downstairs delivered, the atmosphere felt a little calmer. It was a three course meal, with each course served in four small bowls on a wooden platter. The bowls were placed in a square and we were asked to eat them in clockwise order starting from 6 o'clock and attempt to guess the ingredients. Without giving away the chefs secrets, Ill just say this: losing our sight instantly forces you to use our remaining senses and as such, they were heightened exponentially during this time. Our ears pricked up at each sound that came from neighbouring tables and after a while, we could even sense that our guide was standing nearby without him having to say a word. Feeling for each bowl and fork, and lifting it up to consume the food prepared inside can be summed up in one word: difficult. I'm usually very careful when I dine however I never realised how little I appreciated my sense of sight until I dined at Nox. You really learn about your awareness of objects around as well as your own body, e.g. I "missed" aiming the food at my mouth a couple of times and instead landed it right onto my napkin on my lap.When you dine, you normally savour and judge a dish on it's overall taste however at Nox, the focus was on the individual ingredients rather than the overall taste. The taste testing was both intriguing and adventurous however the highlight of the night was definitely the inspiration we gained from our visually impaired guide and his incredibly positive outlook on life. An interesting question was asked of us during our meal: describe using one word what it felt like being in complete darkness. Most of us said fear, which is not surprising as the most common cause of fear in humans is the realm of the unknown. When we enquired what the most common answer was from other customers, the answer was interestingly, peace and serenity, the feeling of everlasting tranquility. This dinner was not just a gimmick after all, it was a surreal experience and one I'll never forget

Best meal! Great experience. Great service! Although the price is abit too high for a dinner. It's was a good experience, and the food taste amazing ( although we are in the dark) Had great fun especially if you go in a group

This is a unique experience, but to be fair the food is very so so. It is something that you do for the novelty factor, service is good, staff are friendly, but food is is pretty average. For the price you pay you get much better standard.Drinks are good though, but they do seem to commercialize the whole thing a bit, but what do you expect, it is Singapore after all

Went to Nox to celebrate Carl's birthday last Thursday. When we first arrived, we were warmly greeted by the friendly door hostess and were ushered to the lounge where we each ordered a cocktail while we wait for our time to enter the restaurant. The cocktails were marvelous! I had Ignite My Passion which was concocted with passion fruit juice and he had Bacciferous which you probably know what it consists from the name itself.We had to deposit my purse and remove our watches before we enter the dining area - basically, anything that emits light! Thankfully, there were nice lockers that we can keep our belongings in. We were introduced to our server for the night, Harlini (I think that's how his name is spelled) and after a brief introduction of ourselves, we had to take on the very first challenge of the evening which was to climb up a flight of stairs in pitch darkness. With my hands on Harlini's shoulders, we formed a human train and geez, was it nerve-wrecking! After we're done with the stairs (which was no easy feat at all), we were brought to our table where we had our 3-course meal. Good thing we weren't lygophobic because there's simply no tinge of light in the dining area. Imagine sticking out your fingers and wondering where they are.Harlini patiently prompted us to get familiar with the table setting - telling us where the cutlery were. And shortly after, we were presented with our first dish of the night which of course, we had no means of finding out how it looked. I won't go about elaborating on the whole dining experience now lest I be deemed as a party po*per! So I strongly encourage you guys to go check it out yourself.Having dined at several fancy restaurants, Nox is indeed in a league of its own. While the concept of eating in the dark is unconventional and probably frowned upon by many, this had been such a wonderful and unforgettable experience for me and I fervently encourage you to go garner it - one that goes a long way down the road

A special dinner in my life. It was the big difference, upon a great style. The atmosphere was so romantic. I could feel the rhythm and the taste of food mixed together. The foods were so delicious but the price was not cheap. The service was on top rating. Come here with your girlfriend and enjoy the life

Went there with a girl friend at Nox...I would say it is interesting to experience ONCE, and for myself, I don't think I will go back for the second time. I would recommend to my friends only whom haven't tried before. For ladies, please do not wear short skirt or shorts, cos the aircon is freezing.. especially when you are not able to take control of your surrounding

Ok so like thousands of other people I checked out Nox on Tripadvisor and saw many excellent reviews putting the restaurant at the number one spot in Singapore so was excited to try it for a special occasion. We booked for four adults at 9pm...we arrived at 8.40pm to get a drink first as many 'people' have raved about the cocktails. We ordered and our drinks arrived at 9.10pm. This is a very small bar area and it was certainly not packed so absolutely no excuse for the wait. After enquiring several times about when the table was ready we were told they would check. Roll on 9.35pm and almost ready to walk out we are told our table is ready. Led upstairs by a visually imparied waiter (who was excellent) you enter a room of total darkness, complete darkness. This is the whole concept. This is pretty cool, for about 10 minutes. The food comes. Now unless I am in the absolute minority here we all thought the food was average at best. Out of four dishes maybe one was enjoyable. We left as quickly as we could and paid over $500 for four people. The staff upstairs are badly let down by the staff down the stairs. This irestaurant is a complete novelty. It is essentially eating average food in the pitch black. I very much doubt it will have any repeat customers. Telling the majority of excellent reviews are from those with one time reviews

I’ve heard about this kind of restaurant before, but experience it myself was a big WOW. It was quite excited not to see anything at all, if there was no sound, I would feel like I was all alone. I’m not an expert, so I’m not sure if the food tasted better without sight, but it tasted amazing. My guider for the dinner was very professional and friendly too.I love it. It’s a must in a life time

Found out about NOX when my friends liked the facebook page. After checking out the concept and reviews, I just got to try it out first hand myself.The place is located in kampung glam, a location that was catered for early settlers coming from middle east suggesting that there are plenty to see and you could hang around the area before or after the meal.I really like the idea of having a locker to keep my belongings before the meal, besides feeling secured that I will not lose any stuff during the course of dinner, I had the opportunity in the longest time to have a great meal with my wife without any of us peeping into our phones.Greeted by the friendly server, we were lead up a flight of stairs to our tables and orientated on where the utensils were all in the dark. The experience just sets us thinking, how it feels to be visually disabled. You can't see the food, you can't see the surrounding but the rest of your senses just seems to get stronger, its a mixed feeling of helpless and excitement Then came the food, somehow the way the food was delivered made it easy for us to feed ourselves "blindly" Its a special feeling just when u are wondering when the next dish is going to be served and out of nowhere you hear the warm voice of the server informing you that your treat has arrived.Every dish or I would say every mouthful is enjoyable, the combination of different favours, textures and layers.... heavenly.....This is one of the meals in the longest time where I was smiling from the time appetizer was served until dessert made its way into my stomach. Every moment is nice, I mean u could really concentrate on your meal without the any distractions from any source.I love the concept of hiring visually disadvantaged servers to help us find our way and I am glad that I contributed to them in a way or another. They are the ones taking care of us in that environment and they must have felt good about it.Worth every penny and time spent..... Delighted to know that the menu changes every 4-6 weeks.... Offically a fan now....

Food was very good, concept very interesting, drinks were a notch better than the usual bars/restaurants/hotels... But what reaaallly blown me away was the service! Considering the host and waiters on level 2 are visually impared, the service was impeccable. The efforts in training, communication and coordination certainly show with such efficient and smooth execution in their operations. I enjoyed the whole experience, from the lovely pre-dinner drinks, which is visually pleasing, to guessing the menu & eating in pitch dark. I would definitely choose nox over some celebrity restaurant. The price for 2 for dinner with cocktails was 200++ but totally worth it.
5
The drinks are good, food is good, the service is good, the overall experience is excellent! Need I say more? You should this place
5
I love it here. Super love it here.Since I am local, I have come this once last year. And it is one of the greatest experience ever. The atmosphere seem to be both thrilling and fun at the same time.The food is super great. You should come and "see" for yourself
5
My bf brought me for birthday dinner at Nox. This is my first visit here, we were served by the friendly staff and services was beyond expectations. Not to mention the excellent food and dessert.. definitely worth the visit. Thanks Nox and staffs for giving me an memorable birthday ccelebration. Would definitely recommend friends there.
5
Amazing experience which allows me to appreciate my sense of sight better. In the darkness I realized I listen and smell better. Unless you are afraid of the dark, otherwise I strongly recommend having a go. Good food and great cocktail. Truly enjoyed the dinner thoroughly.Tip: go with people whom you are absolutely comfortable with talking about anything under the sun, otherwise it can be rather awkward not being able to see the person and not knowing what to say. I had e best company one could ask for! :

Well, perhaps the picture of the day could be the Malevich's Black Square and this is just a glimpse of it. As some people have mentioned it was awakening and eye opening experience. To dine in the dark when even deem light from your watch feels disturbing. Food is great but a bit too rich to my taste

After chancing upon NOX through TripAdvisor, curiosity really drove me to make a reservation to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday there! After arriving at the restaurant, which was easy to find, we ordered cocktails to chill while they prepared the tables for us. The cocktails we ordered were Ignite My Passion (Very refreshing, fragrant and flavourful passion fruit) as well as Skippy Dip (peanut butter cocktail). After resting for a while, we were brought upstairs to sit by our host. The darkness was unbelievable and we couldn't see even our hands! There was no difference between closing or opening our eyes. >< Yeaps... Our host very patiently explained our table arrangements and also each time he served our food, he would explain to us how to eat and where our food was located. Yup... and so we had three courses, with 4 small bowls each course. It was fun guessing what we were eating and some tasted really obvious! Also... there were misses. We fought over some guesses. After revealing the answers to us... it was really surprising! Love the food which was prepared for us... there was a mix of eastern and western flavours, although more towards western. :)It was an unforgettable experience and I'm still thinking of the wonderful and unique experience. Of course... it's on the pricy side. Perhaps, the cocktails can be charged cheaper

Am curious about Nox - Dine in the dark when I was told about this concept. I decided to give it a try and went to try out this interesting concept of dinning.We were greeted by friendly staffs and they offered us with great hospitality just to ensure our comfortable in the restaurant.Overall I would like to say - great food, great ambience, great service and with easily located location.Nox is really a great dinning experience for me. A place that is more than just a dinning.Highly-recommended to all my friends
5
The whole experience was great from the friendly front-of-house staff to the attentive and helpful waiter and the food itself. The service alone was probably the best I've had in Singapore and the food was great, especially since some of the dishes were outside of what I would normally order. Having to guess at the dishes and struggling with the dark, it was a great night and lots of fun. Recommended
5
The entire dinner experience was a rare gift, from start to finish. From service hospitality to food tastes, the treat for the individual was in every sense, exquisite. Menu creation was bold and adventurous. My senses were so assaulted from the first platter that I tasted fullness! Yet each mouthful of flavour burst only made me hungry for more. It was a symphony of tastes! By the end of the dinner, my friend and I had recollected ten drums full of the good things in life. And our dinner guide was all-inspiring. Everything was brought together to help us pay attention and take pleasure. Thank you for creating such a unique space for dining

I decided Nox after the introduction of a friend and read reviews praised everywhere for a dinner with her ​​boyfriend Eating in the dark is a great idea that I first experience The food here is delicious and the staff are enthusiastic and fun I had a fun dinner with my boyfriend I really enjoyed this restaurant and will go back when we go honeymoon
5
I'm not trying to be glib here, but this really was an eye-opening, perspective-changing dining experience. I dined at Nox with my partner, to celebrate our first anniversary as a couple, and we were both nervous going into the evening. Our server made us feel completely at ease though, and before long, we were totally enjoying the evening. I couldn't have asked for a better way to celebrate a milestone.Dining in complete darkness made us appreciate the food we were eating in a completely different way. It also made us communicate much more with each other than usual, which was a pleasantly surprising aspect of the evening.The food was almost not the point, but it was excellent anyway. I have a hard time evaluating it vs. food I've had at other restaurants, because the way I experienced it was very different. Having to guess what we were eating -- and also what it looked like -- was also quite fun.I would whole-heartedly recommend this as an experience, and definitely for a couple or a small group of friends

One of the best restaurant experiences this year from start to finish.Booking - the online reservation system is very easy to use. A few days before my booking, an sms was sent to remind me of my reservation and when I called them, the lady was very nice and professional and remembered I specified on the online form it was a birthday dinner for my pregnant wife. She immediately offered a complimentary cake and a special menu for my wife with no alcohol/raw food. 5 stars for service here.Arrival - The waiter who greeted us was very polite and guided us to their really nice waiting area with lush sofas. The cocktails are a must try. I ordered a "Ignite my passion" and it arrived with flames on top! Awesome drink. They also did a special no alcohol mocktail not on the menu specially for my wife. 5 stars for service and drinks.Dinner - We were guided by our vision-impaired host up a flight of stairs, and honestly both of us were really worried because it was pitch dark but our host was very reassuring. He guided us to our table and soon we figured out where our spoon,fork and water was. And how to eat while in the dark, its really easy. I won't divulge the menu but you get 12 dishes, 4 starters, 4 mains, 4 desserts. Certain dishes were better but overall you can tell the chef spent a lot of effort into creating dishes that taste, smell and even sound awesome in the dark. We were there at 630 and in the darkness felt like we were the only ones there, a very special kind of feeling, so do go early before more people turn up and it gets noiser. Host was excellent and kept asking us how we were going, and if we needed anything. 5 star for food and servicePost dinner - You get to guess the food you had and we were maybe 70% right? For those we guessed right, its amazing how you can taste your food so much better when you cannot see. And yes, we got a special slice of birthday cake complete with candle for the wife. Lastly, we got shown the pictures of the food, and the presentation is awesome, its too bad we couldn't see the actual food, but i'm sure the chef spent lots of effort to present it well even though we cannot see it.Overall - Guys, bring your wives/GF here. Per pax 78 with 10% service charge is more than worth it. it'll make her day, and remember "Happy wife, happy life". =) will visit again soon. Thanks, Nox. You made our day

Its a fantastic concept. We hv been to many fine restaurants. Beside enjoying fine food n service, usually we pay ard 400-500 for 2. Tis restaurant gv u a whole new experience in an affordable price. (We pay ard $240 for 2 w drks) Dine in total darkness. Not only we experienced n empathise w how the blind actually live day by day. Yet w the peace of mind knowing its juz a unique dining experience. Portion of food is substantial. 3 course meal (appetiser,main course n dessert) each course consist 4 dishes. So u get to eat 12 different dishes. All the fun of guessing wat u r eating n exchanging food in the dark. U n yr partner will hv quality talking time w no handphone distraction too. Best for couples n small group of friends. .

Dining in the dark is an excellent idea. I cant image what we spent . I luv it so much . The staff s trained well and professionally. Food is fine . In short this is an unforgettable experience . We promise we will be back one day to enjoy it again . You wont wanna miss it in your life...

It was my boy friend's 25th birthday and I wanted to do something special for him. So instead of taking him to a usual fine dining place I decided to pick Nox after a friend's recommendation and reading rave reviews everywhere for a more meaningful birthday dinner.The moment you step in to the moment you walk out, its an experience.Nox, first calls u on the day of your reservation to understand your meal requirements, preferences, allergies etc. they design the menu accordingly. We reached there for dinner and we were first treated to some starters n drinks which were really good, a trailer to the epicurean delight we were about to immerse in a few minutes.We were then briefed about the dining experience, our waiter Halimi was assigned to us to guide us and take care of us. Our phones, watches, any light emitting devices were taken and kept in the lockers. We were then guided by our visually impaired helper Halimi to our seat. The moment he took over there was complete darkness, in pitch dark the only thing that keeps u moving is trust on each other to guide u correctly. We formed a human train and followed Halimi to our seat. He then explained us how to eat, where our wine n cutlery is placed etc. While waiting for our first course we were trying to adjust in the darkness. We could hear friendly banter around so it wasnt as intimidating as I had thought. Also the fact that I could hear my bf, it was reassuring that its safe and there's nothing to be anxious about. In a while our first course came and we were enthralled by the delicious aroma of the food. We started playing a guess game to guess each dish and its ingredients. Our menu was slightly different but still was really fun. Every single dish tasted amazing. It was truly 'tantalise your taste buds' experience. The main course and desserts blew our mind as well.But most touching was to hear Halimi's story of how he lost his sight but not his spirit to live and make the most of his life. He really impressed us with his impeccable service and attitude to life - 'I serve each table as my last and that's how I try to do a good job'. We would come back to Nox for sure and bring family and friends for a meaningful experience. We came out more grateful and happy. The food was brilliant, service Top notch and experience mind blowing. Kudos to the team

All the reviews for this place are good for a reason, it is well worth the price, the experience is amazing and I'm so glad we did it. Ate quite a few things that I would not look twice at on a menu . It helps that it is all cooked to perfection. Would have done it again but they have the same menu for a month and we are only here for a week
5
The initial impression of the place was that the staff were very polite, and because the concept was sort of hidden, it was intriguing and exciting altogether. There was an initial waiting for instructions, but it sort of gave an impression of how the pace of dinner would be like, slow and steady. It might not be for the faint hearted or claustrophobic to try, but I do recommend all who are daring to give it a shot. Notably the food was served quite timely and it was a good variety of different food that complemented each other. Towards the end we were required to guess the ingredients and it was satisfying to be pretty accurate, adding an additional feel you don't get anywhere else. Knowing that the menu changes almost once a month, I might go back and try it again. Overall a good novel experience and I hope the menu will not disappoint in the long run.

It was definitely worth a visit, and gave you a whole new perspective on the dining experience. I was surprised by 2 things - a) how bad I was at guessing what I was eating and b) how much reading a menu and seeing the food contributes to my overall enjoyment of a meal out. Each course is made up of 4 different bowls of food. I found them to all be a bit 'samey' apart from the desserts. Maybe it's because I don't eat meat. I also missed out on being able to see photos of the food I had eaten as they don't have those for the vegetarian option.Unlike a previous reviewer, I didn't find the next door conversations intrusive but it wasn't a busy night.But a definitely unique experience and gave me a real insight into the problems that sight impaired people have. At least they didn't give us chopsticks

Great service, good food, fantastic experience. Worth the money we are paying for... It's really an experience of a lifetime. Must try for al
5
I am very please with the service they provided here. The staffs were nice to us and the food were excellent. It's really an unforgettable experience

This was definitely a new experience! We were led by our visually impaired guide into the restaurant itself and found that it really is pitch black. You could not see your hand in front of your face! Our guide was very helpful and was always there when we needed him. It was quite funny fumbling around in the dark for our cutlery and glasses - luckily nothing was spilt.The food was delicious...you have to guess what ingredients went into your meal as they will quiz you at the end, as well as show you what it was exactly you were eating. There are three courses, each one was divided into four different small dishes to try. It was enough food for us!Definitely give this a go if you are in Singapore for a new experience and some good food. You should make a reservation, as seats fill fast

was excited when i saw the opening. finally had the chance to go. Pre dinner - Service is excellent , from reservations to them calling your to confirm the food allergies . Special kudos to our Hostess - sorry i forgot your name ! she was awesome with all the explanations and everything else. DARK DINNER - Service is top notch. Our waiter Halima* was helpful all the way . food wise it was something I've nv tried before. eating in the dark really opened my eyes to the food. *PUN TOTALLY INTENDED*after dinner drinks - back to more drinks , drink list is good. drinks mixed are kinda awesome. again helpful wait staff and attentive bar tenders. ambiance is really good. only wished the music played was more smooth than the funky beats . i cant wait for the next change in the menu . i will be back ! PS i cant remember if i got his name right

The overall experience was not amazing for me and my friends. Sure it was exciting and definitely anmexperience to be had once in your life, but not a place we'd go back again. Here's why we won't go back again:1. The food was mediocre - it was interesting and fun to guess what favors and what you were eating in the dark. But honestly, the food wasn't superb. 2. Slow and poor service - the downstairs waiting area was run by three maybe four ladies and one bartender. It took forever to get a drink. Because of the seating times, most people showed up around the same time, as a result service was slow. 3. No safety / emergency plan - one person in our party fell ill and had a slight panic attack during dinner, and we called for help. We were sitting in the private room as there were 12 of us. No one could hear us, and one of us had to get up to shout for help. After 5 minutes someone came, but we were told to sit down and someone will come to help. Post that, we waited for ten to fifteen minutes before someone actually came to help. Either the restaurant was understaffed with visually impaired waitstaff or they just lacked quick response time and a good emergency plan. Imagine if someone had a heart attack or choked on food.....4. Paying the bill - it took us half an hour from coming downstairs to get the bill, after asking for it twice. Some of us paid cash and the rest wanted to split the bill on our credit cards. Those who paid cash paid their share if not slightly more. So those paying by cards got a shock when we were asked to pay $30 more than what we were supposed to. We check the bill and the cash amount on the bill (we gave notes and coins worth 70 cents only), yet somehow the cashier had keyed in $1,011.70. That was odd to me at first glance as Singapore does not have $1 note.... So how did they get that figure in the first place. So I was starting to be impatient after coming down from dinner for 45 minutes already..... And I was not sure if the cashier was incompetent in counting or some funny business they were trying to attempt (cheat my money!). When we recounted the money, it was at least $55 more than the figure they initially inputted and was $42 short from what everyone else had given. Our mistake was that we did not count the cash at the onset and only counted it after we spotted the mistake. Some $40 went missing along the way and we had to cough up the extra. Of course, as the trend goes, it takes them another 30 minutes to void the transactions and recharge our credit cards. By the time we were done, the novelty and excitement of the dining in the dark experience had worn off and just left a bad experience in our minds. Plus, none of the staff apologized for the mistake at all..... Definitely some funny business must have been attempted, we would've paid over $100 more if we didn't check and just signed!!!! Please check your bill carefully!To top it off, when we left, none of the staff said "thank you" or "have a good night" or apologized for their mistake or opened the door for us, all the service you'd expect of a good restaurant. Once the novelty wears out, I doubt this restaurant will hold top spot for long.

I know this restaurant from my friend and its my first time knowing there's a restaurant where ppl can dine in the dark. If in ur country there's no such restaurant, this one is really very good and u must try!! Their service was good, they inform u the position of everything, like where is the fork or glasses. So absolutely no need to worry abt the dark. All u need to do is enjoy their food, having fun of guessing what u r having, and try ur best to pour water into glasses in the dark
5
Had an unforgettable experience... wonderful , exciting, delicious and exceptional service. Definitely a must try !
5
Dine in the Dark is an experience you must try. Totally deprived of your visual sight therefore you are reliant on other senses whilst dining on a delicious three course meal in complete darkness. The food was excellent, the service was incredible ansd the cocktails are delicious
5
This was our first time dining in the dark and we had a blast. The food was great, service exceptional, and mood was perfect. MUST TRY!!!
5
Have to say, I've dined all over the world and my meal at Nox goes down as one of the most memorable and delicious meals I've had. The environment forced you to focus your senses on the food, discover the flavors and texture of the meal by feeling them. Thanks for a great night

Was really excited to try Nox after chancing upon their website. Decided to bring my boyfriend there as a surprise for his birthday.Firstly, the location of the restaurant is strategically located at the corner of Beach Road. Pretty easy to find our way there. Probably like a 100 meters away from Haji lane? It is the perfect location near the party goers, yet distant enough to be away from the bustling crowd. The lounge area is beautifully furnished with sofas and bar sittings. Lighting is dim and comfortable, totally getting the guests into the mood. We were greeted warmly and the staff, knowing we are first timers, very careful and meticulously went over the details of what is going to happen during the dinner. Oh, their signature cocktails are a must try! Loved the Jealousy Looms! After locking our belongings in the locker, our server brought us upstairs to the dark room. He was so patient, and made sure we were comfortable before moving forward. He left us after he made sure we are seated in our seats. We have no clue where he is, or where everybody else is. We could hear chatter from other dinners though, I guess that was the only comforting thing to hear, to know that you are not alone. I was so afraid I would knock down something all the time! We grew comfortable to the darkness after awhile. My boyfriend even said "Yay no more pictures before eating" (Haha). Food was served in small portions of 4. We have to feel our way to the cutleries. And no, we didn't make a mess at all! Was able to eat normally with a fork and spoon. We loved guessing the food! I shall not reveal much of the dining process to keep the surprise element.After the meal, we were brought back to the lounge to guess the food. After which, the answers will be revealed. Man, did I have a good laugh. Some were pretty easy to guess, some were totally off track. All in all, we had an amazing time at Nox. A point to mention is the staffs' impeccable service. The guys were very sweet to prepare a slice of cake for my boyfriend, knowing its his birthday. We would definitely be back when there is a change in menu. If you are looking for an unique dining experience, Nox is the place for you. Oh, and one more point. Phones are locked away, so no phones to disrupt the dinner!! :
5
Different and exciting experience worth trying. Enjoy really good food with excellent service and don't forget to try the awesome drinks and cocktails before going in. A must in Singapore

Brought my boyfriend for a surprise dinner at Nox. We had an interesting experience being a blind for 2 hours. We are only able to use our sense of touch, taste and smell. It was scary at first but the server that served us was really helpful, he guided us in the dark and always out there to make sure we feel comfortable. Tasting the food without seeing the food was really fun. We kept guessing what are the ingredients which we've eaten. The food were delicious as well! Quite a fun experience indeed! Recommended to try and feel the experience yourself! Remarks: They have a cute bartender that mix very good cocktails
5
Have heard of such dining experiences overseas..finally it is in Singapore.First stop, you will be shown to the waiting area where the staff will brief you on what to expect and what are the do's and don'ts while inside the dining area.After which, do order their signature cocktails and relax while waiting to be brought up to the dining area. Note: do visit the washroom before going up.Once ready, our server (rahmat or Muhammad, my apologies for getting the name mixed up) greeted us and brought us up. The lightings were diminished gradually as we made our way into the pitch dark dining area. Our server expertly showed us to our seats, constantly pointing out any obstacles along the way and orientated us on the table layout. The atmosphere inside was excellent and we have to literally feel everything on the table.There are four dishes served for each course. I shall exclude the food details for others to experience it themselves. The dishes were delicious. Once done, our server brought us downstairs to the waiting area where we are supposed to fill up a questionnaire on what we think were the dishes. After which the manager came to reveal the 'answers' and showed us the photos of the dishes. We are very impressed on how the chefs were able to 'confuse' our tastebuds.All in all, service was attentive and patient. Food was tasty. Price was reasonable for a fine dining. This is definitely an unique dining experience.

A brand new restaurant that offers great dining experience. The menu is secretive which makes us feel more curious and excited about it. Food was great, service is excellent. Our waiter (who is visually impaired) was very friendly and attentive as well. We were served 4 small appetizers, 4 main courses & 4 desserts. Each one in its own little bowl, which made it easier to eat. Iâ€™m a fussy eater and I really admitted that Nox does serve excellent food.Our special blind/visually impaired waiter was very friendly, called us by name and always out there to make sure we are comfortable.Like what Nox has described, they are definitely more than just dining, it is a unique mind-altering sensory experience! Highly-recommended to all my friends

Great food, nice cozy ambience and good hospitality and service from staff. Interesting concept of the bar and restaurant setting. Food served was well cooked and their level of service from staff is professional, friendly and polite

It seemed like a great idea - trying out food in the dark, conquering your fear of what one may not normally try and putting your taste buds on high alert.The start of this adventure allowed my companion and I to relax and get used to the idea with an introduction. I order a cocktail 'Ignite your passion' to start the night off and it made an entrance with a flame on the passionfruit! Tasted great as well.After bring led by our guide upstairs, all the while reassuring us with small steps as it dims, all my senses became fully aware of the sound, smells and even imaginery presence of people.The appetisers came shortly with 4 dishes (as with the main course and dessert), and while first struggling to pick up food with small morsels, it became a rollercoaster of flavours bursting in my mouth. I could savour every mouthful, every sip and every bite is filled with surprise, mostly pleasant. The combination of food in this 5 star restaurant is at once subtly sublime blended with pockets of enhanced taste to wake one up.I especially loved the dessert. The chocolate cake was so potent I smelt the goodness before it melted in my mouth. The pleasure was immense - its smoothness and sweetness an indulgence. The hot and cold dessert intermingling with sweet, sour, tartiness, creamy, flaky... every mouthful complementing the next.While it took awhile to get used to eating in the dark, it was an unforgettable experience, one that gave degustation a new meaning. This gastronomic journey awakened all my senses and most of all, in the dark, we ate without pretence, giving our full attention to every bite.The service was personal and it ended with the host revealing the menu and photos of the 3 courses. It surprised me that some of the food were those I would never have tried had I known; and in this I'm grateful for the darkness. Goes to show we should never judge a book by its cover!One thing though, the restaurant does not serve warm nor tap water. It's either still or sparkling so be prepared for a scripted answer if you do ask for it

NOX delivered above and beyond our expectations. Service by the blind waiters was the best we received ever in Singapore. The food was extremly well cooked and the tastes could defintley match a guide michelin star restaurant.. The finish of the meal was completed by the very friendly and understanding hosts and bartender.. I wish we had more room in our bellys to drink more of the fantastic cocktails in the bar.. NOX is a must try when being in Singapore.

Have always heard of this concept so the moment I found out that they finally brought it to Singapore, I made a reservation right away. What set this restaurant apart is of course, their level of service. And excellent food! Went with a small group of friends, one whom even tried the same concept in Bangkok, and enjoyed ourselves tremendously. That same friend said she actually prefered NOX because of the service. Our host, Halimi, made a huge impact in our experience and we are truly grateful to have him throughout the evening.I was surprisingly satiated after our 3-course meal and it was definitely worth every penny! Highly recommended, everyone should have a go at least once in their lifetime =

Dining in the dark was a very unique experience that unveiled a very different way of enjoying food - through smell, taste, texture and yes, touch. The totally dark dining area provided a sense of peace and tranquility once I settled down and familiarized myself with the cutlery, glass, etc. Not being able to see the food made interesting conversation as we tried to guess what we were eating. The food was delicious!The staff were attentive and our personal server, Hamali, was excellent.Can't say more or it will spoil the experience! Go "see" for yourself

Put this restaurant on the top of your to do list! Even if the lights were on this restaurant would be top class with amazing 5 star dishes that tantalize the taste buds, but add the element of eating in total darkness and it becomes an experience like no other.It starts when you walk into the front bar decorated with funky retro nightclub feel with comfy lounges to relax and enjoy a pre dinner drink. Be sure to order yourself a cocktail, they are works of art in presentation and include a list of delicious and unique signature cocktails that you won't find elsewhere.You''ll then be introduced to your vision impaired guide for the night who will take you through the dark corridors to your table and serve your meal.The menu is a secret, and consists 3 courses, with each course having 4 dishes, so 12 all up.At $78S it's very reasonably priced for excellent 5 star quality of the food. I was completely stuffed full by the end the meal. Have a food allergy? Not to worry - when you book they'll ask you for your dietary requirements to cater for any allergies or food intolerances you might have.After the meal you'll go back to the bar and they'll reveal what dishes you ate - be prepared to be surprised.In reading this review back I sound like a marketing person writing an add for this place, but I assure you I'm just an Aussie girl who is wrapped at finding this place on the last night of our holiday and having a chance to experience it before she jets home.Don't think about it - do it. There's a reason this place has shot to 5 spot on trip adviser after only being open 3 weeks, it's because it's awesome

I brought my gf there as a surprise, and she loved it and immediately we were thinking of when we can come back again and who we should invite to experience this event. Our list grew and grew and we concluded such a great restaurant like Nox can be enjoyed with family, friends, couples, and even business dinners too! This experience is probably best experienced in small groups of about 4-6 people, though the managers said they can cater to groups of up to 16 people! Food: When we first arrived, we were greeted and briefed of what to expect for the evening and had a small canapÃ© of water-melon, feta cheese and deliciously smoky grilled prawn. We realised that this was the only dish that we'd be able to see for the whole night and when we tasted the dish, we were immediately excited of the high quality of the food we were about to experience. The pacing of the food was nice and it was split up into appetisers, main course and desserts and each course had 4 dishes each. Our visually impaired waiter (Rahmaat) was very friendly and professional and came back mid course to check on how we were doing. EVERY dish was delicious and the restaurant managed to cater to my food allergies as well and customised a menu for me. The dining experience was very interesting as we took time to savour the aromas, textures and flavours of each dish. Their wine list was quite extensive and I regret not ordering a glass of wine. Initially as I felt it was a bit expensive (about $16- 18 per glass) but also worried that I would fumble in the dark drinking my glass of wine. On hindsight, I should have ordered a glass of wine as I would have probably enjoyed my wine's flavours and bouquet much more in the dark too. It would have paired wonderfully with my food. After our meal, we sat down with GRM Rachel in the lounge to guess our dishes and I shall not spoil the surprise for other readers by listing the dishes, but we THOUGHT we could guess every dish correctly, only to find we got only 80% right. It was nice to be pleasantly surprised and I'm kinda glad that we were unable to guess all the ingredients - humbling experience. When we were showed photos of our dishes at the end, the food looked very impressive and really lived up to the high standards of flavours of what we just experienced. Ambience: The ambience of the place was very nicely posh, from the moment you walked in, the decor was appropriately dimly lit and prepared you for the evening ahead. It has a great looking bar and the cocktails are really yummy, but the idea of chilling out in the lounge before your dinner also helped us mentally unwind before we started dinner. Of course, the dinner itself was served upstairs in complete darkness, so we could not see what the decor was like. However, our other senses were triggered and I could enjoy the plush carpet that we walked on, the soothing music that filled the room, there were no wobbly tables which I detest, and also the calming effect of laughter from the adjacent tables proving that everyone was enjoying themselves. This had a reassuring effect as some might feel a bit claustrophobic or uneasy in the pitch black darkness. Service: I think the stars of the restaurant are really the people working for Nox. From the moment we entered being greeted by Anders and Rachel, to enjoying the delicious cocktails by the bartender, service is truly top notch. I personally like the fact that the waiters are ALL visually impaired and that the restaurant has worked with the Singapore Association of the Visually Handicapped (SAVH) and provided employment for them. I'd like to reinforce that the service is even better than many other restaurants and their friendliness and sincerity really shone through. I left a $20 tip for the staff but I really think that's not enough for the wonderful team they have and the best way to reward them is to spread the word, recommend others to try the restaurant, and to keep going back with other friends too!! I can't wait to go back again. Even if I already know all the dishes, I'm assured that the chef can conjure up a different menu for me to keep me guessing. (I'm told that the official menu will probably change every month) But even if it was the same dishes, just sharing the experience with loved ones will be such a joy. Right now, I'm already planning when can I go back again and who I should bring... :

Such great service, great food and an all in all amazing and eye-opening experience. Dining in the dark was a completely new and exciting experience where I got to REALLY taste the food (and smell it from afar). The anticipation whenever I was about to eat a spoon full of unknown food and the excitement of guessing what delicious thing just entered my mouth was really fun and added to the experience. But what I want to emphasise on the most is the amazing service of the very insightful and inspiring blind server Halimi, who really let us appreciate our sight, and let us learn the life-long lesson that true happiness comes from gratitude of what you have

Great experience and service was excellent. The food was surprisingly delicious as we minus the sense of sight... A mess is expected... But it is amust try at least once

this is one of the best dining experience. although you are dining in the dark, the server was very attentive. you are "forced to use" the other senses in order to enjoy your meal. i cant say much about the food, you just have to head down and experience it yourself

Without sight, we need to use our smell, taste, hearing and touch to make sense of our food. It is a wonderful experience. My friends and I had so much fun guessing the ingredients in our food. And they all taste super good! The staff are very friendly as well! Rahamat and Joseph are so considerate and patient. The staff at the bar are very friendly as well! They are awesome! A mind-blowing experience! Must try! (

Yes, I was quite hesitant at first to try this as I thought how can you possibly eat when you can't even see your food? But it turned out to be a truly rich human experience when the blind become our eyes, opening our minds to a deeper consciousness & appreciation to the delicious cuisine placed before us. The food are so amazing, we really love the rib eye with black rice risotto & our pear tart! The staffs are super friendly & we joke around with them, making interesting noises to interact & make friends with other tables' guests in the dark, having fun conversations & guesses about what we are really eating. It's definitely a great social experience & will hope to come back again~ We will definitely introduce to our friends & family to experience this new European dining first-hand & 'see' it for themselves~

I brought my partner to NOX as a surprise. We are both very into food and I thought that this would be a rather memorable thing to do together. And I was right!We were both a little apprehensive, to be honest. Groping in the dark and not seeing what we are eating seemed exciting and undo-able at the same time!Staff at NOX were fantastic. We felt totally looked after from the moment we stepped in. Our server Rohamad (I don't know the spelling, sorry!) let us into the darkness with patience and reassuring ease. We sat down at our table and he immediately gave us a simple and comprehensive introduction of what was going to happen and the items that were already on our table. There is no need to worry because your server will always be nearby if and when you need him/her. I wish I could say more but I don't want to spoil the experience for others by revealing too much!Suffice to say, the food was great! The servings were generous as well. Perhaps it was the heightened sensory experience that intrigued me, but I felt the chef did a great job putting together a meal that was so variedly textured. I think it was a very serene yet sensual meal. Everything felt slower and I felt that I could really enjoy my food.A big thank you to the team at NOX for this awesome dinner

Totally love the concept of this restaurant - Deprived of your sight, the encoding of the experience of taste takes on a whole new sense (no pun intended). Very recommended again and again, with different people if you want to see how they react.... This is experiential dining at its best
