The vegetarian food here is above average. Tasty and nice. Except I find it a little oily to my taste.

...and got a soupd, fried noodles and Chinese tea which made me feel better within the moment. Pity I could not try more - the place is clean, nice and there is so much to try on the menu. A must for veggies!

Food Excellent with fusion new style of Vegetarian, also able to customize as per requested but need to arrange with the Manager. Boss friendly feel like home. This place only one outlet and recommended.

Tried once and it was during their lunch time when I bought their lunch set (Around $4.50). It tastes quite okay. The menu items are a little pricey but i think it's what you get when you have that type of diet. Rarely see it full but still quite a nicely decorated place

moved to lavender street now** (near lavender & serangoon ave intersection) near mustafa centre.Excellent vegetarian food. mutton curry was our favorite! tum yum soup and the 'fish' with mango/cucumber slices were all great. poor service (wouldn't serve the fish to a group of 10 people) but great food. went with vegetarians who don't even eat eggs-they enjoyed all the dishes. will go again for the food! check timings before going, closed in afternoons

Now moved to 310 Lavender Street. The new place is much more spacious. Excellent a la carte dishes such as eggplant with petai, claypot veggie fish curry and broccoli with monkeyhead mushrooms. We enjoyed it all. Though it's a little costlier than expected, the high quality and pleasant service makes it very worthwhile. A definite thumbs up!

Pros- Good location. Near to Mustafa Centre and Farrer MRT station.- Fresh mushroom selections.- Accept reservations- Oriental Resturant settingsCons- Service and Food is really poor.- OverpricedGenerally serve regular patrons. I will not be back for it anymore at a rate of 1/5. Spend your money elsewhere.Restaurant will shifted to Lavender.Check out my photos for more information

I ate at this restaurant two years ago and was amazed at the high quality and range of Chinese vegetarian food it offered. However, two years later, this place has suffered under poor management and perhaps even a change in chefs. Essentially, the food is not good. My hot and sour soup was like soup made with tomato ketchup and flour, with a few mushrooms thrown in. If I didn't know better, I would say they use food coloring because the soup was bright florescent red. Give this place a miss, it's really expensive and it's no longer worth a visit.

My wife's brother has lived in Singapore for many years and he is a vegetarian. He has eaten in many places all over Singapore and when it comes to chinese, this restaurant gets a full 5* rating. Whenever we visit from the UK, we always go to this restaurant as it is just so good. If you like chinese food and you are a vegetarian then you simply must visit this establishment.Highly recommended
