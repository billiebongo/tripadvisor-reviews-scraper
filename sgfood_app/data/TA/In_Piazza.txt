I went to InPiazza twice. One time I had pizza and another time I had second dishes.I was very satisfied by the quality of the food and the service,Pizza is not heavy and crunchy. Ingredients are fresh, mostly imported from Italy. I advice to try the Bufalina pizza.As second dishes I tried porchetta and seabass. I enjoyed the original italian taste in the food. Porchetta is handmade by italian chef Carlo.I would specially advice this restaurant to who is looking for authentic italian food in Singapore. You won't be disappointed

Good selection of wood fired pizzas and other dishes. Food choices were marked clearly - vegetarian etc. Staff service very prompt and attentive. It was nice new quiet area away from busy orchard road. Yet it was accessible being opposite raffles girls school. Will visit again

Visited In Piazza with friends and family, and I can safely say that In Piazza along with 2 other places in Singapore (Pizza Fabbrica and La Mozza) offer the real deal when it comes to Pizza. Some folks also tried the pastas dished and they thought they were good too. I gave In Piazza, 4 not 5 stars because the service can be better, more specifically, the sequence of servicing the dishing was very intermittent. But would surely come back again

We were excited to try out the new restaurants which opened together with a new hotel complex next to our apartment. However, we were not aware that we were going to be charged hotel prices. All the restaurants are locally managed but part of the hotel which means, sadly, that youâ€™re being charged hotel prices for local restaurants. Therefore, expect to be pay between 20-25% more for what you would normally expect a local restaurant to charge. That said, the portions are generous, the pizza is good quality and the meats were cooked very well. So if you're willing to spend north of S$350 for a table of 4 with a bottle of wine, then this place has your name on it. Personally, I would try a hotel with a view like Spago at MBS for that price, not for locals

I was there for a casual lunch just the other day. The pizzas that I tried was Magherita, Diavola and In Piazza. They are freshly made from the pizza oven and comes out sizzling hot and crispy! Love the crusts! Staffs are friendly and helpful too :)Will definitely come back and visit again

I went for a business lunch with 2 clients and I have to say that they exceeded my expectations, chef pizza chef and restaurant manager are Italian and they make you feel like you are in Italy. We have had pizza (to die for, you can't don't order them) fresh gnocchi with gongorzola and noci and bicatini Amatriciana,everything was delicious and we'll paired with reasonably priced wines, coffee (lavazza) and they have an extensive selections of Italian amari and liquors.Go and you won't be disappointed Grazie guys see you soo

Beware the unwary tourist. This place even refuses to provide any additional bread without wanting to charge you for it, even after placing a substantial order. Mean-spirited to the core. Food is also mediocre
