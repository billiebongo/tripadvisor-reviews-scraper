This place provided plenty of single malt whisky on the menu. Also other choices for champagne,red wine, white wine or spirit. Also decent size of Cigars Room which plenty of choices for cigars.3 sections available for seating which cigar smoke room on second floor, a few table in air con room ground floor and outdoor seating with comfy sofa and soft cushions.Last night I went there was a couple,one play guitar and one sing slow pop song.Ambience was nice and relaxing to sip 16- 18 years old whisky,listen to the song and watching peoples. It was a perfect place after dinner for couple or business talk after dinner.Downside of this place is the waiter doesn't know anything about whisky. My order was wrong year but at least he got me the same brand. The service also decent.My hubby order Lagavulin 16 years old which he quite enjoy it. I ordered Talisker 18 years old which is very smoky the way I like also it's my favorite at all time.Price for 2 whisky was 60S$ which fair.Location is convenient. After dinner at Robertson Walk cross the river valley road then you will see it
