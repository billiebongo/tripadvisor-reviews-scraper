I thoroughly enjoyed my evening meal here. A splendid butter chicken, naan bread and rice. Washed down with a cool pint of heineken.

One of the best places in Singapore to have good North Indian food, butter naan & karahi chicken is must have.
Place is neatly tucked in albert street with pocket friendly prices.

Stayed in Village Court so had food here couple of times since we were pretty late to go to Little India for food. Food here is decent but taste wise could be better and food is also very costly.Service Charge is also being charged at a hefty rate. Service could be quicker

After travelling from Paris to Egypt to Dubai to Thailand and Laos, it was nice to have some different cuisine. The vegetarian options are wide and varied. They include Nepalese food. The malai kofta curry and the mixed vegetable curry were divine. Not the cheapest meal ever, but the service was good and the food excellent.

This restaurant was just 1 min walk from Hotel Parc Sovereign. the owners are same.Most of the foods are spicy and being from India, I would say the foods are not very authentic. The prices are on the higher side with 1 bowl of Yellow lentils costing 15 SGD.Staffs are very friendly and service is good. I would suggest to go to 'Mustard' than 'Shish mahal'
5
The Nepalese food is quite distinct from the more Southern Indian cuisines. They prepare it very well in this restaurant. I especially liked the 9 bean soup. The terrace in court yard of the Albert court is very tranquil and great to have a lunch. Very good whines to match the food.
3
This restaurant is definitely expensive and I also do not like the taste of dish of North Indian delicacies. Not worth value for money especially of you are staying in hotel near to bugis and little India .
5
its few steps from my hotel, a relaxing ambience for dinner, nice food, i really really love it! perfect!
4
Located on Albert court. I had dinner with my family at this restaurant. Service was good. We were not expecting food to be good, they proved us wrong. Food was quite tasty.
4
This was very close to our hotel and served good Indian food. The price is in the mid range . Go here if you want to taste some good Indian food especially north Indian food.
5
was visiting with my parents ... this place has great north indian food. the outdoor seating in the evenings is really very good and enjoyable
highly recommended
4
This place is near to Parc Sovereign Hotel where I stayed in for 4 days. This restaurant offers good Indian food though rates are little high but food has great taste. Service is also good.
4
They have decent selection of Indian cuisine, the prices are above average and the quality is high, not the most authentic place though.
4
Visit Shish Mahal for late lunch.This restaurant awarded michelin bib gourmand.I visit here around 3pm no other customer.Mango Lassi :very good use enough yogurtPrawn curry :curry is good but prawn is same as food courtNaan :soft, tastes niceService :minimum but they provide free water.From my feeling price here is 20% expensive, But because of price no need to wait
4
Right outside the hotel, in a nice courtyard, and 10% discount to hotel guests. If you choose carefully, you can have a nice, satisfying meal at a reasonable price. The food was good, as well as the service, and the outdoor tables. We enjoyed it and had dinner there twice
5
I looked for a TripAdvisor review on nearby restaurants and ended up here. I'm really glad that I did. The Indian food is authentic tasty with the right amount of spice periods they have nice garlic naan bread. We also have the saffron rice everything was wonderful and I would stop here again anytime that I'm in the area
4
Very well prepared food at a very reasonable price. I had the Goan fish curry which was nicely spiced and full of flavour. Portion size was good without being excessive. Will certainly be coming back here as its well worth a visit.
4
The restaurant had a lot of variety,ranging from Indian, Nepali to Chinese food.The food was freshly prepared and was reasonably priced.
4
Village hotel albert court is the Ideal place and setting for this little restaurant serving great quality north indian food. Must try is their Thali which comes with generous proportions of vegetable and rice and na an.
2
This place was quite disappointing after reading so many glowing reviews. The chicken jalfrezi had no heat - at all, in spite of being described as spicy - and the chicken wasn't good. Aloo gobi masala tasted a bit odd, like it had been fried beforehand. Only the naan was good. We sat facing outwards only to have a line of staff facing inwards, which was a little awkward. No atmosphere to speak of, a couple of the waiters couldn't even bring themselves to smile, which I can get over if a place has character...but this doesn't. Pricey for what you get
4
Great food, really relaxed setting and wonderful service. The dishes, whilst some recognisable to a western palette, definitely seemed a lot more authentic and higher quality than what you get in a lot of western country versions of Indian food. Loved the Momo Nepalese dumplings, and had a really nice Mutton curry. Definitely recommend

Shish Mahal ! Yes, the crown ! After trying out various restaurants, we chanced upon this place while walking in the market, and everyone in the group just decided to have dinner there, and there was to be no dissent ! And it turned out as good as our expectation was from a decent Indian Restaurant. The non-vegetarian dishes were just too delicious and sumptuous too! Not just the taste, but value for money too !
3
I asked for the mildest food, which was butter chicken, as I can't eat very hot, but it was quite hot, although I managed to get through it with lots of rice.A packet of moist towels were automatically put on our plate, but was added to the bill! This restaurant is within the courtyard of the Albert Court Village
5
Few weeks a go me and my family visited at shish mahal for dinner. we had a Indian meal with chicken momo...it was great...service was amicable....I have really enjoyed my Margarita to.. they have wonderful outdoor seating... restaurant is very clean and tidy. I would advice to u all to get this experience...its AWESOME

We ordered North Indian Cuisine which was good. The best part is that Hosts are eager to help guest by changing the taste of dishes according to them. The location is also very good and on a breezy evening you can have your food in the open
3
I was there at Albert Court on 9 April. Ambience is amazing especially on a breezy evening or Sunday brunch. Food is reasonable in quality. Service of waiters is average. I was there with a business guest. My Chinese host shared veg menu with me :)
5
Really good welcome and service excellent as was the food. Brilliant to eat outside in a courtyard setting. Plenty of people there as well. Very good atmosphere.
5
I found good food & friendly staff. ... Price also reasonable. Must try....
It's a combination of different taste.... With excellent mocktails and cocktails.......
4
It was very good Indian food. The service was prompt. It was a nice clean restaurant on the edge of Little India. The Butter Naan and the Chicken Korma and Fish Tikka made for a great lunch/dinner
4
The location in the Albert Court Village is almost perfect for this small Nepalese/Indian restaurant, it is a quaint area of the city, i was there at night and the atmosphere was excellent with added music from the place next door.The staff were attentive and quick to welcome and provide on table water, they gave enough time to breathe while also providing the food and drink options well. The food itself was impressive, a good spice and kick to their house favourite dish i had and the portion size was good
4
Spent a lovely evening here sat outside. Food was lovely and portions were big. The food arrived very quickly and staff were pleasant. They could do with a few fans outside, however, so if you're not used to the heat i would sit indoors. Overall, good quality food at a reasonable price, our meal for two was ample in quantity and only set us back $55
4
I eat here & Leo's next door & found both places very pleasant. You can eat outside or in & the courtyard area here is a great place to spend the night. Opposite this restaurant is a bar that sells tiger at $4 & bottles of wine for $18. Having spent 18 months in Singapore off & on I believe it's the cheapest bar in all of Singapore & challenge anybody to find cheaper in this sometimes ridiculously priced city.So , for a good night out come here or Leo's for a meal & cross the courtyard for drinks later.
4
We arrived at the restaurant after a late night at the Night Safari and so weren't sure what the food would be like, but we need not have worried, it was excellent. The only slight let down was one of the surly staff, but that did not detract too muc

When you read trip advisor, sometimes you wonder if people have been to the same place - have a feeling a lot is to do with expectation or attitude. We are all biased in our own way. This is just a North Indian Restaurant (with some Nepalese dishes) that has been in situ for a long time. It is always busy with a mix of nationalities including "Indian". Personally I enjoy sitting outside in an evening, nice open courtyard, (Small but attractive indoor restaurant.)with a good choice of dishes, everyone of which does have its own distinctive flavours and textures. Staff are fine, the men speak good English, the ladies less so. Decent range of Beers, House wines fine to go with spicy food and by Sing Standards , fair prices for a decent size glass S$9. Less frenetic than any of the places 100 yards away on the other side of the main road actually in Little India.Chicken Tikka - moist and flavoursome S$12.50Saag Gosht 13.90 (A bit of a chew needed, but good flavours)Bhindi do piazza S$9.50 - really good flavours of OkraStuffed Paratha (lots going on) $4.50, other Naan.....less price.All the above could be a good meal for 2Very attractive Hotel in the court yard as wel

We had very bad experience at Shish Mahal, I won't go in details but staff have no clue about service industry or how to serve guests in restaurant environment, food was equal bad, curries came first and after reminding staff numerous time we got our naan bread, staff were not attentive at all, on the dinner table you are wasting your time trying to find a waiter. If you are on your holiday or even if you are local there are really good restaurents with excellent service and food in little India on I think race course road, pls don't spoil your evening going to this place otherwise precious evening will go to waste. One place I can recommend is Muthus curry on race course road where we went next day and it was lovely experience. You will feel welcome there

We had dinner here twice during our stay. The staff were very good and friendly. We had to walk past the restaurant to get to the MRT so the staff got to know us well. You can eat inside or outside. Most people choose to eat outside and enjoy the world going by as you eat. The food was excellent on both occasions. Our friends who were staying in Chinatown came back up to eat there as they were very impressed with their first meal there. The price was very reasonable for the quality of the food and service
4
Good hotel...very nice food.Spending your time here for dinner will definitely be pleasurable because of the ambience and the food.All the cuisines are worth a try and can be done so safely.Service is also good.
5
This reataurant is very close to Albert Village resort where we stayed. It served very fresh Indian dishes except the prices are a bit higher than some others that we tried. We loved the cosy atmosphere and the freindly staff.
4
We went there for 2 continuous days! love the lamb biryani. My kids love the cheese naan and milo dinosaurs they serve. Very attentive service. Will come back
4
We had a tandoori chicken, mutton Briyani and mango lassi.
All were great.. The mutton Briyani was the best especially with their kurma as a side. They surely were not stingy with the mutton pieces in Briyani, which some restaurants can be...
5
Stayed at the hotel next door and eat there 3 times in the evening. And everytime was excellent. As elsewhere in singapore, the beer is expensive, but the food made up for it
5
There was a good choice of dishes including ones that were suitable for the children. The service was quick and the food very nice.
It was also very good value.
3
greatly promote by Albert Court Hotel but food is average and amount is small compare with the price...we seem to order india food but look more like mixture of india and nepal. Service is poor need improvement...prefer to Visit little india along serangoon road for better india food

We selected this restaurant due to its proximity to our hotel. We we were seated in a very pleasant outdoor setting where we could watch the passing parade of local and tourists alike going about their early evening business. We did have the option of sitting indoors, but chose the outdoors.The service was prompt, the food was as good as we were expecting and the pricing was good. The fish and lamb dishes that we ordered were cooked very well with well balanced flavors. The Naan bread was probably the best we have every had. Soft and tasty.The only down side was the flavors of the mango lassie, while still tasty, was missing a certain something, that I can't quite put a finger on. Having said that, I would still order another one! Overall we are very happy with the dining Experience at Shish Mahal
3
Pros: Nice location, open air seating, extensive menu, a couple of bars in the neighborhoodCons: Poor serving sizes, very poor service (10 minutes to get the bill, and another 10 minutes to get my credit card back), expensive for the serving sizes.Food quality is neither a pro nor a con. Its run of the mill Indian food. Visit if you're already in the area and dont have the energy to walk half a km to other better options on Serangoon Rd

We had dinner at Shish Mahal because it is located in such a lovely and quiet plaza with outdoor seating, some of it under the stars, some under tents. We were at a table that was protected by the leaves of potted plants which served to protect us against light rain. Waiters were more than generous with water, filling up our glasses whenever they looked less than half full. We are lovers of Indian food, especially curries, so we were looking forward to a high quality of food that would match the surroundings. Papardams were complimentary, and the cheese naan were very good, sticky on the sides where cheese had been melted on them. Some cuts of lamb in the rogan josh were tender and some were so tough that I could not chew them. They did not have chutney of any kind, which seemed unusual. Service was friendly and reasonably prompt. I note that reviewers have widely diverging ratings of this restaurant, so I suspect some diners were lucky, some were not. I felt the prices were a bit on the high side for Singapore, and when we divided the tough cuts of lamb, lack of chutney, and great outdoor atmosphere by the price, we came out somewhere between average and very good value. We would recommend chicken curries over lamb dishes
