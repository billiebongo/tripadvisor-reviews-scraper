Love how chic the place is and beautifully styled cafe at the quiet corner of TIong Bahru. My absolute favourite cupcakes to go to.

Service can be slow
Kid friendly
Great place for ice cream
We got our kids birthday cake f on here- it’s big!! And buttery but I love it
Relaxed and busy at the same time
5
Very cute cafe with a very nice "garden". We tried the nutella and carrot cupcakes and they were really good!! Everything looks amazing and they sell cute things like birthday candles or homemade granola!
5
Very innovative concept/design ! ! They also have a work room- events can happen
Few interesting drinks n cup cakes etc

Great milk chocolate tart (if you like your desserts sweet) and cappuccino. Two cupcake flavored change monthly and are always interesting. THe ambience is cosy: the patio part is covered in AstroTurf and you can sit on the floor as you enjoy your meal, your buys from BooksActually nearby and the daily papers on offer, and perhaps even a chat with your neighbors. Lovely for lazy weekend mornings or a pit stop from sightseeing

I liked Plain Vanilla because it was just that little bit different from the norm as we coffee hopped our way around Tiong Bahru. People of mixed ages relaxing on the (artificial) grass, with the stylish air conditioned bakery at the back, and with a good range of interesting product for sale too.

the setup and decor of this bakery was nice.seems to me the owner put a lot effort in it.the way they presented their cakes and bakery items was very decent and in style.however, staff seems not able to extend that delicate and friendly attitude.they simply performed their work, without smiling nor greetings, not to mention service.to me, i would not recommend anybody going. there're a whole lot cafe with similar cake and coffee quality but a lot better service
5
I have to have a honeycomb chocolate tart every time I visit. Beware - it is worth it, but it is rich and sweet indeed. The coffee is fantastic too. I love chilling with my goodies on the outdoors porch. It’s a great place for a pit stop while exploring Tiong Bahru.
5
Love the food, pies, cakes and salads are excellent. Really healthy compare to other places in the neighborhood.
Good fresh juices
4
Cupcakes were quite ok, but staff and ambiance was the best. Love the mix of food and merchandise. Nice visit!
4
Love the green tea latte and mocha. Banana loaf cake and blueberries loaf cake was my favourite! Staff are friendly as well, you guys awesome!
4
Nice little bakery with working/reading room. Great place to wind down, enjoy a coffee or juice and read a newspaper while doing so.
Enjoy!
4
The cupcakes and tea were nice (although not the most memorable). However, the real attraction is the little faux-grass seating area outside with ceiling fans, swings, and low tables. It has a really beautiful ambience and is a nice place to sit and work or chat
3
No doubt this is an interesting concept, of free seating in the room and on the faux grass. However, I went on a Sunday (unfortunately) and the service was awfully slow and painful. Staff were tired and uninterested- can't blame them given the crowd. I just had a very "meh" experience. The slow speed still scares me though. Cupcake is good, coffee meets expectations
4
Visited PV after some many years! I am very surprise by the changes they have made over the years. There's both indoor and outdoor seating options, we took the outdoor. You basically seat on the floor with a carpet. The concept is very much chilled and relax. Good place to catch up over a cup of coffee with friends and a nice place to do some dating. They have events on weekends and it's pretty crowded when I visited them over a Saturday. I enjoyed myself very much. Their coffee is decent and so are they're cupcakes. They have a varieties of cupcakes which made us spoilt for choices. Will definitely visit again!
5
Quiches and salads are delicious, as are the many cakes. Great decor and wide choice of things. Particularly recommend for lunches or desert. There is low seating in a child friendly area with a swing, and separate air-conditioned seating. Prices are on the higher side as any restaurant here
5
We really planned for our trip to Tiong Bahru and Plain Vanilla was on top of our list. After a visit to BOOKS ACTUALLY we headed to Plain Vanilla and instantly loved the playground/garden nook in front of the bakery. It took some kind of decision making on our part which cupcake to order. Finally, we settled for salted caramel cupcake, peanut butter brownie and lime with chia seeds loaf paired with mixed berry tea. We sure did enjoy every crumb. They were freshly baked and moist. The salted caramel cupcake is by far the best I've tasted. I love the sweet and salty butter taste of the icing. The lime with chia seeds was a refresher to our palate. As we were eating our baked goodies I saw a glimpse of our happy bakers at the background too. I would like to commend the kind lady who patiently gave us directions and a phone number to call a cab. Thank you.

Big seating area - but the seating format is not conducive to linger. The room indoor also has a lot of echo! Went in the evening and the place had crumbs on the tables and floor. That said great hot chocolate and coffee. Definitely go back just for that
5
Stop by Plain Vanilla any time of the day to get your pastry fix. The cup cakes are superb, cookies are lethal. Can't stop eating them.
Great tea and coffee selection as well.
4
This shop have so many cupcakes and good atmosphere among local resident area. It is good for Breakfast and nice place for meeting.
4
This place has the most amazing variet of cup cakes, all sorts of flavours. Although need to but in 2, 4, 6, etc
5
Two coffee to go; easy, fast and good. They rent bikes too! These look amazing and must be fun to ride. Pies look impressive, but haven't tried. Will come back for these later. The space is amazing!
4
I'm really not a fan of cupcakes, but you definitely should come and give a shot if you love cupcakes, I personally recommend the Earl Grey Lavender and Salt Caramel(a bit overly sweet for me), the latte is also good, and the muffin is just so-so, but to be fair , it's really a nice place for sitting down and chatting with friends for hours, the venting is great~
5
This bakery makes their food onsite and you can see them preparing and baking the food. The roasted pumpkin, rosemary and pinenut tart I had was delicious. We also shared a chocolate, salted caramel tart which was also as great as the coffee. We walked the short distance from our hotel, Wangz, to here but it is also a very short taxi ride if you prefer.

My colleague lives in Tiong Bahru and always brings Plain Vanilla cupcakes to the office when she wants to give us a special treat. They never disappoint! The icing is perfectly structured--not too gooey, not too hard--the flavors are delicious (she usually brings Red Velvet Cake, Snickerdoodle/Cinnamon, Earl Grey, Cookies & Cream--they are all terrific), the cake is moist and fluffy. I've been to the establishment a couple of times and it has a lovely ambience. They sell other delicious-looking pastry items, too, though I haven't tried them. But the cupcakes are the BEST

Located in a unique neighbourhood with a lot of bookstores and caffe on it. Plain Vanilla is a unique bakery of their own. Aside from the product itself, they provide this unique creative space for events with unique ambience. somewhat reminds me of a co-working space.The cakes were great and unique, they had products like black sesame cupcakes - something you don't see everyday. The ambience were a total creative ambience, this is one place you might go to jog up your creative brain while having a cupcakes or two. Discussing your next project with a friend, or simple sat reading a book you just bought next door. Anyhow this is something that's not a typical singapore mainstream space (read: orchard malls) that you need to visit at least once

Cupcakes have always been a mystery to me. Its mysterious that something so simple can be so tempting, beautiful and tasty. Its mysterious that it can have so many different iterations and still continue to mesmerize people from far and wide.Plain vanilla is one of those cupcake places that i just keep returning to. I love almost all their cupcakes with a particular liking for their mainstays and daily specials as well. With holloween around the corner, i'm sure the talented chefs already have something up their sleeve.Cupcakes here go at around $4 a pop depending on the ingredients used and you can definitely taste what you're paying for. Having said that, i shared the above with a few friends and their acceptance of the various flavors varied from love to cringe because one of them hates sugar. The overall consensus for that tasting was that the flavors were strong.So give it a try if you're in the vicinity and judge for yourself if its your kind of cupcake. It certainly is my kind of cupcake and i'll be back for more

A nice little bakery in Tiong Bahru. Fit's nicely with the up and coming hipster and foodie atmosphere here. My only complaint is the avoid the lemon tart - way too eggy. I ended up throwing it away and buying some gingersnap biscuits (which were amazing
5
A nice and clean place for everybody who have a sweet tooth. Good quality pastries, fresh squeezed fruit juices, good coffee. Nice place to go with kids with a swing and floor mats to sit and play.
5
Came here for dessert and they have quite the spread of cakes, cookies and cupcakes. The cupcakes were perfect and reasonably priced at around 3.90 SGD each. The outside picnic style seating is very unique and a nice place to spend some time.
5
Crowded but they have nice cakes! Tried the salted caramel tart and apple cupcakes. Both are equally amazing. No wifi though
4
Although most sitting is outdoors, it doesn't feel too hot to be sitting outside with the fan and the shade. I had a cupcake and coffee. The cupcake is really good! Must try if you are in the area!
4
Just stumbled into this place, but it's so cute. I wish I could have tried more things, because their menu looked great. I got a nice raspberry lemonade, and loved it.
4
Kale, feta red rice and quinoa aren't on many menus here but my salad was fresh, light and delicious. Perfect on a hot day with a cold pressed juice. The Rosemary lemonade is superb.

Heard pretty good reviews of this cafe and so I and hubby decided to visit the cafe on a weekend afternoon. The cafe was not crowded with lots of choices of seats which was good. Ordered one peanut butter brownie, one salted caramel truffle tart and a banana chocolate cupcake, and two iced beverages. Both the brownie and tart were hard and abit too dry in texture which I thought was surprisingly disappointing. Both were too sweet! As for the cupcake I could not taste anything except again just very sweet taste. We could not finish the food as we just felt overloaded with sugar!! Pretty disappointed and confirmed that we would not come back
5
I love the cupcakes here. I love to bake at home and I know how cupcakes baked using the best ingredients should taste like. I think that the cupcakes here are very good compared with other shops. I used to like the location at Yong Siak Street but I am disappointed now that they changed the decor and all customers have to sit on the green grass like carpet on the floor. I am not young any more and do not enjoy sitting on the floor. However Plain Vanilla Bakery has other locations like the one at Orchard Ion and another one near Botanic gardens. I will continue to visit those shops when I am in need of cupcake therapy

Good portions, which helps their rating, but I was disappointed with the oily canned tuna that made the salad a lot less palatable.Tip: Please use tuna in water or brine, at least for people who request no dressing, so the salad isn't soggy and oily. Good coffee and a pleasant atmosphere - unique environment, nice and quiet.I'd come again.

As all the other reviews here say their cupcakes are indeed fantastic, the cinnamon brown sugar is one of my favourite cupcakes of all time. But I actually prefer their other bakes, which are also fantastic and very creative. I've actually enjoyed every item I've tried. The peanut butter brownie is dense and fudge with the most amazing peanut butter frosting. The blueberry cake is moist and full of fresh blueberries and again the frosting just makes it even better. I've also tried two of their tarts, the strawberry custard and the chocolate caramel. The tarts are without a doubt my favourite items from Plain Vanilla but I'd be hard pressed to pick a favourite between the two. The strawberry custard has a crisp brûlée crust covering the custard and strawberry jam underneath while the chocolate caramel has a smooth and rich chocolate ganache that reminds me of a truffle over the caramel layer, with a beautiful chocolate crust. Truly wonderful treats. I've been to both their Tiong Bahru location and also their new one in Orchard Ion and the quality is consistent at both and definitely worth a visit

Yet another place I fell in love with while spending a week in Tiong Bahru.
Great coffee, great tasting cakes and I fell in love with their 'Grilled Toast' (toasties) with Banana and Nutella. YUM.
Awesome laid back environment, very pretty décor. Friendly service.
4
Obviously a very popular place for cakes, bakery, a lot of caucasians, the place is relatively small, to me the taste is just above average
4
This place has various cupcakes that you must try.I tried red velvet and salted caramel there's a bit sweet for who doesn't like sweet but tasted was good. อร่อยดีค่ะ มีของอย่างอื่นขายด้วย ทั้งขนม กาแฟ แยมรสต่างๆ ต้องมาลองให้ได้ค่ะ
4
Good place, modern, calm and welcoming design. Superb bakes - cakes, cookies, cupcakes. Brownie was a little overlooked and air-condition could be a very big plus, though vents are doing good job.
5
If you have chance to visit Singapore, you shouldn't miss a very chill bakery in Tiong Bahru area. Everyone always imagine to very busy and crowed attractions therefore some of them are looking for a place to slow their life. Here is the place. Cup cake is very perfect combination with hot America. Try it
5
We were walking by here for brunch and decided to pop in to have a look. The place smells delicious and besides some bags of baked goods, recipe books and other baking items there are about 6-8 daily cupcake specials. We had a Christmas special (I can't remember the name) and it was delicious, very moist with a good amount of frosting to cake. I'm not a fan of a big mound of dried frosting sitting on top of a bread like cupcake, this was a nice moist cake with just enough soft icing on top. I was NOT a fan of finding out that the "special" cupcake cost $0.50 more at check out. If this is the case, it should be clearly labelled. I know $0.50 doesn't seem like much but it's the principle of the thing. I picked my cupcake go to pay and am told it's more expensive even though there is NO sign indicating that? Singaporeans are pretty law abiding but I would have turned and left if I was in any other SE Asian country!! =)They do have a small picnic table outside and some people had ordered sandwiches. We were just there for the cupcake

Plain Vanilla already has awards for Best Bakery in Tiong Bahru for both 2014 and 2015 and the honour is well deserved. Not only can you get great cupcakes and a terrific cup of coffee (prepared by a superb barista) but also there are delicious tarts and salads available for lunch and dinner. I chose the salmon tart and was not disappointed.The service is also excellent and very friendly
1
I went to the location in Tiong Bahru on a Sunday morning, not crowded. I just ordered a brownie and iced tea. He staff were a bit cranky and didn't offer to heat up the brownie. I have to say, it is probably the WORST brownie I have ever had. Stale, dry, crunchy and not very much cocoa flavor.Maybe the cupcakes are better but not what I wanted
4
Peanut butter chocolate brownie - nice texture, generous peanut butter icing however its super sweet, they could go lighter on the sweetness.Salted caramel chocolate tart, fresh and light crust, soft dark chocolate with salted caramel oozing from the middle of the tart -SUPER GOOD.. Must try! Cupcakes - tasted the salted caramel, nothing fantastic. The topping is too sweet. Strawberry white chocolate - texture is soft and with strawberry fillings. One of my favourite among the 3 flavours. The best well balanced on the sweetness would be the chocolate ganache cupcake. I like this flavour 2nd bestOverall if the baker would decrease the sweetness, they would have more healthy customers returning for more desserts

I consider myself a cupcake connoisseur. I have tasted cupcakes from various bakeries around the world, and I have to say that Plain Vanilla is tied for first place (with Cupcake Royale in Seattle, WA). I do like sweet frosting rather than whipped cream or cream cheese frosting. The setting was charming and beautifully decorated, which made for a great atmosphere. It was an absolutely charming cafe, in a really unique local neighborhood. Well worth the excursion! I had several cupcakes over multiple visits as well as the raspberry pink lemonade, and it was all amazing. It will be my first stop when I return to Singapore
