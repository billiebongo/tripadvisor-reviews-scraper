I stood in line for 30 minutes only to find the taste and look average.
I give credit to the Ma And Pa still running the stall, but I would only return if my guests really want to try it.

We visited this stall accidentally, and after do some google, we found out this stall has a great review. But after gave a try, I just found it OK. Not that nice and couldn't say that's the best char kway teow in town.

Best fried kway teow I have ever had. Been there literally 100 times and never been disappointed. This man makes the same dish every day and is world famous for it in Singapore...

One of the popular Char kuay teow haunts in Singapore, the stall serves it with a lot of cockles, and has a strong sweet sauce flavour.

The char Kway Teow man n his Filipino Wife dish out the best char Kway Teow. Not cheap but the Kway Teow is moist n well fried with clams, prawns n pork. Helping is big n very yummy. You need lots of patience in queuing as it is extremely popular

I've heard about this hawker from a friend and decided to give it a try. Once there we headed for the famous char kwaya teow and it really lived up to its reputation. It was a big serving with crunchy bean sprouts, Chinese sausages, eggs, spring onions stirred through flat while noodles, favoured with dark soya sauce and God knows what else. It was very tasty

It is one of the the other significant local dish beside the chicken rice. There are 2 stall serving fried kway teow at Zion Road Market. It is best to eat at the hawker centre itself inorder to enjoy the softness and the wok heat. Tried packing back and it loses its char taste. If you prefer it sweeter, do request for more sauce

When we first showed up at 11 plus, the door was still locked. It remained so when we finished up our lunch. We had to go back go back at 2pm after our coffee, and the Chef owner just opened up. He kindly postponed his lunch and stir fried up a hot Kway Teow for us. Maybe the wok had not been tuned up properly, the food tasted dry and overcooked. Maybe we will give it a try next time

This is my no.1 Fried Kway Teow. The owner n his Filipino Wife just has this Kway Teow made. I always asked for double portions of clams ( hums) plus an extra egg. The way the Kway Teow is fried n the special recipie simply 'wonderised' this dish. Frid Kway Teow without the clams is no fried kway Teow n I wondered why some queued up for so long n then requested no 'hums' n how I wished I had the guts to tell them to pass the ' hums' to me. Believe me, this is the best fried Kway Teow stall n I don't give a damn if PM is also a patron as his photos are pasted all over n am not sure if he really appreciates fried Kway Teow as his famous quote " Mee siam Mai hum"

This food stall is a famous one frequently by local celebrities and foodies. It has won several awards and has been featured on food guides and blogs.1. LocationLocated opposite Great World City, it is the first stall upon entering the food centre from the main road entrance. There is a small open air car park next to the food centre and some parking lots along the road. The bus stop is next to the food centre. I find this food centre convenient to visit due to its central location. 2. QualityFried kway teow is a local dish that can be found in almost any food centre. It comprises of yellow noodles, flat rice noodles, bean sprouts, Chinese sausage, fish cake, egg, lard, garlic, sweet sauce and other seasonings. Not many chefs can prepare a version as tasty as this one.3. ServiceNot much service to expect. You join a queue, wait until the batch of fried kway teow is cooked. Then you order the portions you need, pay and collect using a tray. You should get a table first, before ordering.4. PriceThere are 3 sizes at $4, $5 and $6. Additional egg costs $0.50 and additional cockles cost $1.Overall, the taste and experience is worth the visit, especially if you have not tried this stall's fried kway teow before. My family and I are used to this fried kway teow and have been eating from this stall for the past 15 years. There are probably other stalls that serve comparable or better fried kway teow. But what I really appreciate is the consistency of its fried kway teow - it tastes and looks the same all this while. Whenever I want to enjoy a delicious plate of fried kway teow, I know where to head to

Very very very over-hyped. Oily appearance, couldnt detect any real taste, visually unappealing, just nothing special.
Would I come again: NO

Serving potion is generous , less oil looks good but not fantastic, well below my expectation. The Kuah Teow is all mashed up and cut up into too tiny pieces.

Very tasty char kueh teow and generous portion at $3.50. Not much of a queue when I was there on a Sat around 2.30pm ie only 3 person ahead of me.

Zion Road Fried Kway Teow is located at No. 18 Zion Road Hawker Centre (opposite Great World City). This is accessible via public bus, free Great World City shuttle bus, taxi and car. Unfortunately, there is no MRT lines servicing the location.The stall starts business at 12 noon. However, a queue is often spotted even before they open for business. All for a good reason - the best things in life are worth waiting for!A plate of Char Kway Teow (CKT) costs between $4, $5 or $6. A $4 plate comes with a generous serving of noodles, flat white rice noodles, cockles, Chinese wax sausages, fish cake and egg. The flavor is good and ingredients are well mixed while stir-fried. The boss does a good job at ensuring and maintaining quality. This is by far, the best CKT I have tasted. What's even better? The stall is located near the city and not tucked away in some far away locality.I would recommend this as a MUST TRY

I'm a big fan of fried kway teow. I could eat it everyday if I have a chance. This taste is abit salty compared with others. I prefer it could have a little bit more of the sweetness. The noodle was not absorbed enough taste though
5
They just churn them out and it's such a great nosh... Seems to be one of the best kiosks in the market but if I had any room left after my 4 dollar meal I would have tried something else as well the owner is awesome..I took a great selfie with him and his cook

This is a very famous place, highly recommended by many right here on TripAdvisor as well as on many local sites. Foodies and celebrities also recommend it. The place always has long lines. Perhaps all this had built up a lot of expectations when I first tried it out. Still, I was not expecting what turned out to be fairly mediocre kway teow, which was DRIPPING in oil. Not sure what the fuss is about. You can have equally good kway teo in your average food court

Tempted by Dr Leslie Tay's "Only the Best" review, I was not disappointed. While the wait was indeed long, the flavours were adequate compensation. The sea-saltiness of the cockles, the divine crunchiness of the pork lard (my favourite!) and the Chinese sausage were blended harmoniously with the slight sweetness of the sauce and the silky noodles. Very shiok indeed

This is a must visit at this hawker centre, queue up and wait, you won't be disappointed. It's fantastic food made fresh there and then, you can opt for non spicy. There's take away as well. Eat here with the locals. Each mouthful is absolutely an explosion of tasty yummy noodles

Mr. Há»“ Kian Tat is so famous he's been invited by the President to the Istana. There are several kway teow stalls at this Food Centre; his is the only one with the long lane. His char kway teow is indeed very good, but not to "die for" as the signs claim. Ask him to add cockles for flavour
