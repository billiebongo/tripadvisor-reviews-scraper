Punggol Choon Seng Seafood located off Changi Village near Changi Sailing club still provide the Same old taste of theirs. Mee Goreng and Chilli Crab and even their Pipa Duck are fantastic dishes.
Nice environment and nice staff

This is purportedly Singapore’s oldest seafood’s restaurant and whether that’s truly the case or not, there’s clearly a reason why it’s been around for so long. It does the usual staple found at seafood restaurants but does them well. The shrimp paste chicken in particular was one of the best versions tasted and the mee goreng and fishmaw soup were nice as well.Great dinner option after a day out at Changi beach

The location is a bit far but since we were having meeting in the hotel nearby, we do not mind walking there. To our surprise, the restaurant is housed in a colonial style building. Thinking that it's dinner on a Monday, we could have the restaurant to ourselves. But crowd and diners started streaming in around 7 o'clock... their specialty dish such as Mee goreng, prawn cake was good however the crispy duck could be improved. Quite a nice dining place, worth paying a visit if you're around the vicinity

This restaurant serves very 1).Good Crispy Duck, something like the Beijing Duck wrap with Strips of Spring onion and cucumber and dip with a traditional sweet sauce & if you like it a bit spicy just add in a tinge of their homemade Sambal Chilli. Yummylicious. Very suitable for foreigners who likes Duck meat. My foreign friends loves it very much, so do many locals. Although this place may be way out for many, going there is easy by car or taxi. Bus will take a longer time. Very good place for airport transit passengers staying at nearby hotel or holiday homes, Abnb.Another dish is the 2). Prawns Pancake, very flavourful with minced Prawns in between and sesame seeds toppings. Next is 3). Their Mee Goreng (traditional yellow noodles) fried with slices of Cuttlefish and Prawns with beans sprout and spring onions is very nice too although it may be a bit spicy for those who can't take spicy food. 4). Try their Drunken Prawns with Brandy soak into the live prawns and cooked live with herbs and you will love the soup after the fresh live prawns are cooked.5). Deep fried squids are also nice.6). Sri Lanka Crabs or Cray Fish (skipper lobsters)cooked in your favourite choices of different sauces of your choice. Be it Buttered, salted eggs, black pepper, famous Chilli sauce, or healthy choice, steamed.7) They also have choices of live fishes cooked your way. Their menus are a plenty and food generally very good. Enjoy your meal

We were impressed when we reached there. It is like a British bungalow with quiet surroundings. We were hesitated whether we should go in as we afraid it must be expensive. We browsed through the menu at the entrance and found that their prices are reasonable. We had their signature dishes, Mee Goreng, Ngoh Hiang, Fried Baby Squids. The taste ok but not like before in old Ponggol.It is indeed a good choice to bring overseas friends to this restaurant with such an unique and nice atmosphere in Singapore, provided we have the transport

On my final day in Singapore, my customer took me to this restaurant. It was only 2 minutes from my hotel abs wished I had known about it earlier. Housed in an old colonial building, this restaurant serves fantastic fish dishes. We had the pepper crab and the squid. Both are highly recommended. If I am back in Singapore I will go agai

While in Singapore, it's all about chili crab. But salted egg crab is harder to prepare, has more character, more flavor, and this place simply prepares it par excellence.Sometimes, a guitarist will sing a few songs. I like him because he is really obliging and will sing a few songs at request

This old Seafood Restaurant is situated in Changi Village at Turnhouse Road. 10 minutes by Taxi If you are transiting and staying near Changi Airport!! Prices are average depending on what you order. A very good choice is their Crispy Duck self wrapping with dumpling skin and to go with cut strips of spring onions and cucumber strips (something like Peking Duck). With Peking Duck you wrap with its crispy skin). But Choon Seng's ONES comes with the crispy meat, yummylicious!!!Next is the Pan Fried or deep fried prawn pancake & prawn rolls. Drunken Prawns with Soup cooked with Brandy right in front of you is another bestie. The prawns are live and fresh!! You may like to try Salted Egg or Buttered Prawns too. Yummy!!Chilli Crab is another popular & delicious dish here too. If you don't like Spicy, try the Black Pepper type or Salted Egg or Butter Crab.Their Mee Goreng (Fried Yellow Noodles Spicy) is also pretty good too. My Dutch friends loves the Crispy Duck so much that, he and his wife & their family ate it 3 times in a row of 3 days while staying there, nearby hotel, after I brought them there on 1 of the days

We went to this quaint restaraunt for the Chilli crab and we were not dissapointed, we were there quite early so we had this huge place to ourselves. The staff were excellent and were very helpful when it came to the finer arts of crab eating. The service and food was excellent and the setting quite rural and peaceful. Well worth the walk and the effort in finding it, the restaraunt is inside an old homested that was once a hospital and it has a certain grandeur to it

Get the duck and the crab and the prawn rolls. Excellent signature dishes that have stood the test of time. The crab could be a little fresher and the sauce thicker but the whole experience for me was sublime. Highly recommended!

It was our 1st time here, we decided to try the popular chilli crab & their signature mee goreng (fried noodles). We also ordered the seafood crispy noodles for the kids. The chilli crab was okay, like any other chilli crab we've tasted in Singapore. It was $65/kg. We had the mini deep fried mantau to go along with the spicy crab's gravy. The mee goreng was more like yellow noodles stir-fry in sweet chilli sauce with lots of seafood. We didn't really like it. In my opinion, the crispy noodles tasted better. Overall, the food was ok but not good enough for us to go again.

This is the third time I visited the restaurant but I feel that the quality of food is not as good as before. Nevertheless, I must give compliments to the service rendered. The restaurant is situated rather far from the city centre but the environment is cool and quiet and comfortable. We ordered the pork knuckles but it was rather dry and not juicy. The crab meehoon soup tasted rather plain. The crayfish was big but there was very little meat inside. The taufu was ok. We also ordered the recommended dish which is the crispy fried baby squids which was good. The best dish was the roast duck wrap which was tender and juicy. We hope to go back to the old tastes that we had before

I have seafod eaten across Asia, but this is the best, there is a lot of competition from far more fancy restaurants but the food here is in a class of its own. We had pre-ordered the crispy duck, which was also to a very high standard. This is not a fancy restaurant, no starched white tableclothes here, instaed the food and the venu do the talking. Great building in a great location, full of locals and a few favoured guests like me. My hosts had pre-ordered the dishes, so I don't know the names but we had two whole fish cooked in different styles but the delicacy of the flavour was sublime, add to this they have a great wine selection, Truly excellent, i wish I lived in Singapore - i would go every week

My family of five visited the restaurant at Turnhouse during the weekend. We ordered their signature dishes such as Prawn fritters and Ngoh Hiang, fried baby squids, Nonya steamed fish, vegetables, crispy duck with popiah skin, mee goreng and the star, chilli crab.We have no complain over all the dishes we ate. Of these dishes, Chilli crab was our vote for the best dish. It went very well with the "mantou". The service was good and the ambience is conducive for our celebration.We will return again

Recommended by colleagues this restaurant is famous for their mee goreng (fried noodles), unlike others, this mee goreng made with seafood and it tastes delicious. Had several dishes, Peking duck, soft bean curd with meat, Pancake with red bean. I would suggest go in groups and order more dishes. Ambiance is good and ample parking. Suggest you make reservations before going. Open for lunch and as well as dinner. You will never regret with their excellent signature dishes

There are 4 dishes I just can't get enough of . There are another that is so good but I will stick with these 4. Pepper Crab, Steamed chillie Seabass or Pomfret, Fried baby squid and the Indian fried noodles. If there is room then the steamed crabs and fried duck . I could sit for dinner and lunch at this no nonsense restaurant that is an old British Officers Mess with high ceilings. I feel like a 1920 Tai Pan being served from a Chinese secret kitchen. No bull, just super duper Seafood

This is our second visit to this restaurant for the year. I have been coming to this restaurant for the last four to five years. The standard of food had been very consistent and in fact awesome! The Ngoh Hiang is a must to try. Generous ingredients stuffed inside. Loved the crunchiness of water chestnut paired with prawns and meat. Shredded duck served with very thin popiah skin look alike is another dish that I enjoyed. The skin is so springy and tender. The Thai style steam fish is also very refreshing. Mee goreng is another favourite. For dessert, the yam paste is awesome. What impressed me most is the service that I received tonight. We accidentally knocked over a cup of tea. I was very impressed when the waitress moved over in record speed with two napkins. She quickly layed the napkins over the wet area in a fast and orderly manner. Which contained the whole spillage in a matter of minutes and we can continue our dinner without much discomfort.Enjoyable

The restaurant with its old fashion parquet flooring, extremely high ceilings and interior furnished with humble tables and chairs ensures diners are relieved from all the unnecessary spotlights excessive fixtures that might distract them from the food. and ,dine. Located in an old colonial bungalow in Changi, having a meal in Ponggol Choon Seng is akin to dinning in at friend's home.Our usual fare would include their famous chilli crab, pepper crayfish, crispy duck, mee goreng, tofu garnish with pickled radish, ngoh hiam (mixed minced pork wrapped in soy bean skin) and prawn paste pancake. We would then end our meal with another must have, their red bean pancake.Another reason why we love the restaurant; excellent service. Friendly staffs who make an effort to recognize you and are always polite and friendly. Been to this restaurant countless times and they never fail to impress! Whether it's to entertain overseas guests or just an intimate dinner with the family, Ponggol Choon Seng Seafood has consistently ensured that our dining experience was a pleasant one

We first discovered Ponggol Seafood at the Marina Yacht Club in 1997 with Kiwi neighbors, and have been going back ever since. Even after returning home, we would never miss a chance for dinner here when visiting Singapore....at their Adams Avenue location and now in Changi Village. My wariness at taking colleagues disappeared when the jugs of Tiger arrived ice-cold, followed quickly by signature appetizers of Crispy Fried Calamari and a set of Crispy Prawn Pancakes with their special sauce. Wow! While the fish mull and crab soup could have been skipped (too dull), what followed with Ponggol's Special Seafood Fried Rice, Cracked Pepper Crab, Salt and Pepper Prawns, and Baby Kai Lan in Oyster Sauce was bodacious! We enjoyed every morsel! The new location also brings back the aura of old Singapore now lost in Chinatown and many other places. The early 20th century building, with its porch and high ceilings reminded me of life in the 'Black and Whites' two decades ago which adds to the ambience and allure of Ponggol Choon Seng Seafood Restaurant. Ask for 'auntie' Susan, and she will take very good care of you. Rise up Singaporeans and do not allow this treasure dating back to 1956 get lost among all your eateries
