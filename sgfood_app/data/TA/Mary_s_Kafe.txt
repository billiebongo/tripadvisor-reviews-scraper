I parked at ntuc next door and it is easily found. Went around 2pm and they ran out of susie pang so i took away currypuffs, cakes etc.... tried kueh pie tee (soso). Think will try set lunch next time if i visit again.

Excellent food especially the chicken curry and sweet and sour fish. Simply delicious, not forgetting the hot and piping pineapple tarts!

Nice little cafe serving simple local Singaporean food - reminds me of the food cooked by my mother. Not a lot of selection though. Can be very crowded sometimes. It is located in the premises of a church just next to the Art Museum.

Just minutes from Bras Basah Mrt station you will find Mary's Kafe, a cosy little cafe serving Eurasian food, the kind that my Eurasian mom used to cook. Its affordable comes with a main dish,drink & dessert at $8.50. I specially like their Sugee Cake, its buttery & moist.For the main course Ilike their roast bee

Mary’s kafe is located at 1 Queen st next to the bras basah mrt entrance. Serves good home made food from the Eurasian community like curry devil, chicken tempra as well as Peranakan favourites like ayam masak merah and ayam buah keluak. Not many places like this around. Highly recommended. Food choices depend on the day however there is a regular daily supply of cakes and pastries like the Eurasian sugee cake and pang Susie.

A friend took me here for lunch and it was great! We had shepherd's pie, roasted chicken with spaghetti, pie ti and finished off the lunch buloh hitam. It's the closest you can get to home cooked food. Mary who runs the place with her daughter and sister are friendly.Do note that they are not opened for dinner and the day to day menu changes according to what Mary decides to cook that day. Food on the menu is served until it runs out. Do go early at around 12 if you want lunch bec by around 2 pm, you get whatever's left for that day. Apparently the place is not opened during the weekend. You can also buy bottled achar and today, meat loaves were available for takeaways. I had warm pineapples they were not too sweet and the pineapples tasted fresh. Am planning to go back for another fix soon. In the meantime, I managed to survive a lunch coma

The food as Mary's Kafe is awesome. It is home cooking at its finest. They often serve Peranakan or eurasian food that is hard to find in Singapore. The food is also cheap and each order is a set. It comes with rice, a drink, the main and a dessert. It's a real steal. Do note the it only opens during lunch on weekdays and it does get crowded.

Pleasantly surprised. Needed a quick lunch before hitting the museums. Ordered Vietnamese grilled chicken and a Chicken curry type dish. Both set meals came with mini pancake dessert, choice of drink and sides of steamed white rice and nonya cabbage. Both meat dishes were well seasoned and flavourful balanced off nicely with the sides. Food tastes like what you get at home, cooked with love and consideration. Portion size was just right, not too little, not too much. They must have consulted with Goldilocks. Service was good considering it was "partial-service". Not a biggie and the ambiance is somewhat Spartan, but you know what, it works. And works very well. Authentic home fare at a very reasonable price. Highly recommended, proper original 'fusion' fare. I would even say a must experience for the traveler who wants a real taste of Singapore.

mary's a good place to go whenever we needed something comforting, somewhere non-pretentious. its like going back to grandma's where you can sit, eat (good real food), drink tea and have a slice of cake. its my go-to place whenever i need a breather from work.

Having bought Mary Gomes’ Eurasian cookbook a while ago, my wife and I decided to visit Mary’s Kafe in the afternoon of Tuesday 3rd November 2015, during our trip to Singapore. We were delighted to meet Mary in person, and she graciously and warmly welcomed us. Since we had already lunched elsewhere that day, we opted to have some Eurasian snacks and cool ourselves with a sugarcane drink and iced-lemon tea.At Mary’s recommendation, we opted for Pang Susie and Pattie Curry Puffs. Both of these were absolutely delicious and made to perfection according to her recipes in her cookbook. We regretted having lunched elsewhere that day and vowed to return to Mary’s Kafe and enjoy her exquisite home-cooked style Eurasian meals on our next visit to Singapore
