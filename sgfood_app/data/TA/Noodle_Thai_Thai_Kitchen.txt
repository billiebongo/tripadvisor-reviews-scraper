Enjoyed their noodles yesterday. The place seemed authentic because of the Thai locals. They have cheap beer too!

The most flavourful and amazing lemongrass chicken I’ve ever tried! Really good service and cheap beer in the heart of Singapore. Can’t ask for more really!

Lots of great Thai restaurants in this area of Singapore (Golden Mile) and this one is up there for value. Portions sizes were adequate the beer icy cold and reasonable price. Definitely worth a visit

Found this place while craving Thai food on beach road and didn't disappoint. Dishes were delivered fast but super fresh, even with customization, I.e spice and garlic levels. Service was attentive with recommendations to boot. Gr8 value for money for SG! Only 1 year old hence why not too highly ranked ye

A rain storm forced us to shelter here and we decided to have lunch. A great menu which was easy to follow and food that was delivered fast and hot! Great taste and at a very reasonable price, only $16 for two set lunches and two cokes! It's just near a Hippotours bus stop on Beach Road

Nice little restaurant and the owner is very friendly. We orderd two original pad thai which was one of the best pad thai I've ever had. The reason for the one star less is that they only brought us one and the one a little bit later. But it was more an understanding problem I think. They served also different spicy sauces and I relly like them. A great way to start trying some food in singapore

Having just spent the last few weeks in Thailand we were craving some more Thai food.The restaurant was good value at around $8 for a Pad Thai and $12 for Stir Fry with Cashews. But unfortunately the food wasn't brilliant. It didn't taste like the food in Thailand, being either a bit bland or was overly spicy.It still looks new though, so maybe worth a try in a few months

Didn't know what to expect at this restaurant when we dropped by for Sunday lunch. Browsing through the menu we spotted dishes not commonly found in Thai restaurants here in Singapore. But having been to Bangkok numerous times we knew we were in for an authentic experience. Price wise it was aligned more with places in the suburbs rather than in town. We were sold and it didn't disappoint at all. Do try the deep fried morning glory. The other regular dishes like basil minced chicken with rice and a souvide egg, was one of the best my daughter has tried. We will be back for sure

Tremendous receptionBut there was deceit in every dish. For example a prawn dish had just one prawn and when enquirer they claimed the dish had two tiny prawns too. Absolute cheating for a dish costing 15 sgd. Accept the dish was tasty yet won't recommen

Came here for lunch today with a friend and opted for the Pad Thai lunch set. Quite cheap food but quality was only average. Fairly popular place at lunchtime.

This place is a pleasant surprise. The food here is cheap and good. The set comes with a dessert too.

Having spent a lot of time in Thailand, this is absolutely one of the best spots to visit in Singapore for authentic Thai cuisine. Excellent Flavours, great value and Super friendly staff!

Small family business, very nice food and very friendly people! If you love Thai food definitely a place to be!

We went here in March 2017 and loved it. Delicious food and great service (which i found rare in Singapore!). Served Asahi beers which is always good!

Tried the dry noodle based on their recommendation. It was simply excellent! Very tasty and original. I have tried a number of Thai (chain) cuisine in Singapore, none came close to this. The Thai (chili) sauce that came with it was a perfect match. It was not just any ordinary sauce. This one has the absolute authentic Thai flavor that blends in well with the noodle. Though the restaurant is not exceptionally big (maybe around 50 pax?), these people are passionate about bringing the best of Thai food to their customers. You can tell not only by the details they pay attention to in their food creation, but also the warmth they bring to their customers. Keith (I think he is the manager of the restaurant) was patient and hospitable when serving me. He took time to understand my likes and dislikes and recommended the items accordingly. Prices are very reasonable and they are net prices. There are no service charge and GST. Highly recommended to head down and give it a try

A most delightful family-run restaurant offering authenticThai cuisine. The staff were both charming and very attentive. A most suitable family venue; indeed, we have subsequently re-visited with my daughter and family who reside in Singapore for another excellent meal. A must for any Thai food lover who is seeking to optimise food quality and cost. Our sincere thanks and our very best wishes.Peter & Pat, Dorset, U

Not only was the food scrumptious, the service of a high standard, our waiter was diligent in checking that we were happy with our meal and drinks. This restaurant is a block off the Sultan mosque eating areas so it was a cool pleasant experience on a busy Sunday.

Noodle Thai Thai Kitchen is cheek by jowl with myriad eateries between Ophir Rd and Jln Sultan, all of which have people outside to lure passing tourists. One feels that Noodle is just enough off the beaten track to miss out on high foot fall, so it doesn't have a fishing maitre'd or al fresco tables, and a good thing too for people like me who would happily run a mile in the opposite direction from the in-your-face tactics and inflated prices. As you'd expect in Sg, the place is spotless, but it takes away the fun of guessing how to order and pay that you get in hawker places as it has very traditional waiter service. The staff are friendly, the menu is extensive, the food really good and the frozen beer, well worth a shot. Hawker prices sweeten the deal and I'd recommend Noodle Thai Thai Kitchen
