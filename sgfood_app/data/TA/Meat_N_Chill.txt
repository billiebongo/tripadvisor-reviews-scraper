Son tried this place and intro me. The food was absolutely wonderful. The ribs are tender and meat fall off from home easily. The home made apple crumble was heavenly. Must order.

Went awhile back and did not get great service when staff did not understand our requests food was not as good as mentioned as I could have had just as good items around the corner in the coffee shop.

We had dinner here, the rack of ribs that I had was perfectly cooked, really mouthwateringly tasty, I also had a side order of spam fries which were delicious! It's a cool place with friendly staff. I'll go back!

Had dinner here with my family. It was all around pleasant. Service was nothing fantastic, but enough. Environment really casual.The food takes a while to come out, though the appetizers of quesadillas and buffalo wings were really delicious and promising of dinner.Unfortunately however, though my spouse and I ordered the exact same cut of steak (300g med-rare Grain fed ribeye/$36) he got a much better cut and doneness than I did. My steak was full of stringy uncooked fat and cooked unevenly. Some parts were way more well-done than I would've liked, and the texture was rough. I did not at all enjoy my steak even though ive been known to be capable of eating 700g when a steak is good. It's too bad they assumed the white guy was the steak aficionado. I must give credit though, to my sisters 300g Angus ribeye steak cuz that was much more delicious for $6 more. And my dad said their ribs were "pretty good".All in all I doubt I'd make the trip back here unless someone else really wants to

I was looking for a different experience for dinner and there are so much hype about this joint. The place is run down and really old school The server are not very well trained Unable to connect and no smile Food overall is tasty but I will not come back again because the waiting time is quite long ... So if you are hungry and expect a fast service DONT! *the Mac & Cheese is surprisingly tasty despite the appearance

From the reviews that I read, this is one of the top place for value for money steak but it was the ribs that win as it is one of the best I had. The meat literally fell off the ribs without having to cut it and the taste is just right. For steak, it was too tough and is just passable.However what will put guests off is the slow service and rather straight faced waiting staff. At one stage I caught glimpse of the waiting staff blowing into the glass that is to house the milk shake apparently to get rid of the dust which is a put off.The staff is simply like robots and do not do their job with pride as at lunch hour, there is only one staff manning 3-4 tables of guests. Call for refill of water and ketchup is relatively slow. Overall the experience is average as the price is reasonable and the food above average

Went for dinner with a young baby , ordered 5 main course , 4 came in different timing and the other came as wrong order , they did not do any recovery and we were told to wait for 10 mins , and we did , again we check with the staff ,then came another Filipino staff told us we need to wait another 15 to 20 mins ... we check again after 20 mins and no answer ... anyway , supposed to celebrate early Father's Day dinner , but sadly it was a terrible experience ...will never go back again nor recommend to family and friends

This is a popular restaurant around six avenue. Advisable to make an advanced booking. We were seated upstairs at seven pm on Sat night. There were only two other tables beside ours. We ordered Mac and cheese for the girls, and the following : buffalo wings, angus rib eye, spam fries, bbq pork ribs in southern sweet, honey mustand and burborn. Also had the shiraz beef ribs. Unfortunately they lost our orders and we had to wait for an additional half an hour before served (!). Tables upstairs were all filled by 8:30on. Generally good experience except for the lost order and they didn't attempted to recovery with serving the fries or wings first.

Right, we have been going to this place for a couple of times and haven't been disappointed in the quality of the food. We pretty much order the same items:- Ribeye topped with truffles- Ribs Original- PorkchopsPersonally I don't like truffles on my steak but the Mrs doesn't mind so that's her default choice. The steak was always cooked to our liking and more importantly, their steak had a great meat flavor which we often lacked at (more expensive) steak places in this city!The porkchops were my personal favorites. Were being the key word here and I'll come back to that later. Used to be two beautifully cooked thick porkchops that came with a nice and tasty gravy. Ribs, never disappointing and since we live close there, we also took it out one time and the quality was great. Every single time, the flavors are there. Meaty, tangy, salty in the right proportions. Add the fantastic texture and it's a crowdpleaser.Until last Sunday. We noticed that the staff had changed. Not just that, the menu changed! But wait, it only got better!!Previously the staff seemed overworked and uninterested. This time they added 1 more staff and that paid off. They came to our table a couple of times to ask how everything was while previously you had to pretty much dance naked - and even that wasn't guaranteed to work - to get their attention. The staff were smiling and that makes a huge difference.Changes to their menu: yea, items got a bit more expensive but hey, everything is getting more expensive so fair enough. What was so good to the change that you now can choose between Angus Ribye, grain-fed ribeye and NY Strip as cuts. Not just that: also choose your size! Gin! Bonus for me is that the truffel is now an option, not a default.The Mrs ordered a medium (usually medium-rare lover but chose rare so she could share with our son) NY Strip of 400g. The meat was G R E A T. Tender and flavorful. With two caveats: she ordered the pepper sauce on the side but it was poured over the steak when served. The waitress recognized the mistake once she saw our looks and wanted to amend but we didn't send it back. Second mistake was that the steak was much closer to rare then to medium-rare, let alone medium! Another waiter came to help and this time we sent it back. I had the porkchop and where I used to get 2 pieces, this time it was one piece but the weights would have been the same. Unfortunately, it wasn't cooked well: the meat part was overcooked while the fat wasn't rendered well. It was a serious let down. The waitress did mention beforehand that the porkchop wouldn't be 100% cooked and I agreed to it: porkchop should be a bit pink in the center to keep its moisture but this time they missed it.Nevertheless, we will be coming back as the quality of the meat itself is value for money. Don't let the simple decor scare you off. This is not a place that you want to pick to impress a first date but a place to get great meat products at a very fair price. The changes in menu and staff are a great improvement and I hope it will remain that good.Oh, did I mention their fries? If I didn't: it's a safe choice for side dish!

Went here for a steak and was very satisfied with the meal.500g rib eye. Well cooked and a good price.Didn't particularly like having to write my own requests though and that's why I didn't give it 5 star but no real hardship.Will definitely go back
4
Must try the mussels in white wine... it's superb! The truffle steak this time wasn't as good as the one served at my previous visit - too difficult to chew on the excessive tendons.
4
The steak was juicy and succulent. Nicely done. Staff was friendly and quick. Would definitely return to try out the other items on the menu.

A good food critic and a gourmet enthusiast must have great taste bud. I understand that to know if you have great taste buds and many of them is by chewing on a piece of raw kale and if it taste very bitter you have great taste buds in your tongue. Hope I have that. Right, now to business. Meat n Chill best beef ribs in town or Smokey's Smokehouse at Joo Chiat Place?Have not tasted Smokey's yet. Meat n Chill had some low reviews due to no food becoz its that popular and kinda haphazard management, it would be prudent to book in advance But, cannot fault the ribs and greens. Absolutely delicious. Price is fair. Haphazard cook too. We ordered 2 texas beef ribs both came at the same time on wooden boards one had 2 ribs the other had 3 of about the same size. Obviously the cook think we cannot count and were unable to rationalize that we have been shortchange. Perhaps they have the last 5 ribs last night for 2 servings. Aren't we suppose to have 4 ribs per serving? To be fair when we complain to the management they gave a slight discount.All in all still, like Makansutra say "Die Die must try!" Oh by the way, you have to fill in your order form and submit your order at the counter.

Good food for a good price. Did not blow my mind but I really enjoyed it!The staff is friendly. Only negative part is that the toilet could really use some cleaning and it's located on the upper floor so it's not really wheel chair friendly.
4
Family dine out at this place. I Recommend quesadilla , rib eye and bbq pork rib that worth trying. The place is small and reservation is needed especially during the weekends. The 1 litre draft beer requires a bit of waiting time to serve because they have to chill the super sized glass. Like it and hat off for this small Singaporean restaurant

My wife and I heard good things about this place and decided to check it out. It turns out that it was really good. My wife had a BBQ ribs and I had a Cajun Chicken. The portion was generous and the food taste really delicious. It probably had one of the best ribs in town, nicely favoured. Meats are tender and soft, not too dry , just enough texture. The Cajun Chicken is a huge chunk of fried chicken with Cajun favoured coating. The appearance was not too impressive but it was surprisingly good. It was nicely done with this unique favour that reminds me of southern American food. It was a hearty meal for both of us and reasonably priced. Highly recommended if you are a meat lover.

Dropped by on a Sunday afternoon about 1pm. Staff are friendly and quick, first impression counts. The place had about 4 tables filled at that time.Ordered the signatured Cajun pork ribs, was cut into individual ribs, which aids the diner as cutting ribs is never easy. The meat was tender, Cajun was average, but definitely good overall.Buffalo wings was a bit on the sweet side. Acceptable as a whole. The environment was cosy, good place to meet and chill :) price was a total of $30 spend, no drinks ordered, ice water available. 2 storey with 70 seats. Saw a list of reservation for the Sunday night about 30 people

Of all the restaurants in that row, this one is quite popular and one has to make a reservation for dinner in order to avoid disappointment. My wife and I went without booking and it was full, but they kindly opened up the upper deck which was meant only for special functions, and we ate there in comfort and privacy for some time before other customers started to arrive too. We had ribs, mussels, fries, salad and a glass of wine, all for under $50 net. I'm bringing the rest of my family back here soon

I visited the place months after their opening since I'm a chaser of value and not hype. But being a meat lover, I had to give this place a shot.We tried the RedNeck Soo-veed steak and it was decent. They got the done-ness right but the fries on the side were inconsistent. Within one serving, you could find stiff fries that's been fried in overly used oil, then there were golden-brown, crisp fries with fluffy insides. Interesting.As for the beef rib I tried, it was supposed to be combining the best of Cognac and Wine but I found it rather forgettable. The meat was very tender but considering that it's a meat-themed place, I expected more. I really did.Oh well, the value isn't too bad and as I mentioned, it's worth a visit
3
Went for the signature platter, but was informed that it was not available as it was in the process of being "improved"Quite a fair bit of items we ordered, was not available, was surprised, it being a Friday night, was of the opinion that it would be on of their busier evenings, so would have thought that they would have stocked up.Food took awhile to be served. Unlikely to make a return visit.

We actually used TripAdviser to find restaurant in Singapore for our trip this spring. The staff was very friendly, they spoke English very well. Everything from food till interior was at the highest level. So good we will come back next time.
3
Maybe we where a bit unlucky due there was a very big group. Overall food was OK. The more it's a real pity when the food for your wife comes much later then yours. The fries came almost after I finished my beef and the mayonnaise was 2 x promised but never arrived. The waiter ask 2 times which wine and I made it 2 x very clear which glass. Later on the bill still the most expensive out of two. The 2nd side they forgot as well. Food OK but so many restaurants in SGP have the same quality. Staff so so. Not really a 'must' to come again

I am pretty easing going with my food. Horribly it started with a "clean" plate with leftover meat from the wash. Both plates were wet. Ordered a side dish of oysters they do not know how to shackle and all the oysters had shells and some had been ripped out earlier and placed on the shell. The service was horrible and the lady did not know how to take away dishes that were done or clear a filled table. Overall they need to train your staff instead of leaving them to clear tables which they aren't observant either. Meat was average and I could have gotten just as good or better meat at the coffee shop which serves similar dishes. Overall sadly doesn't warrant the price you serve.

Nice atmosphere. Had the signature ribs with Cajun. Very, very good. Fries- excellent, salad - fine, Southern biscuit almost there, but a touch too sweet for my liking. Apple and onion side was worth choosing something else - Not to my taste. Rest of the family had rib eye steak which was superb, excellent size for price, and came with a very nice pepper sauce.Very good wine selection and a variety of beets and ciders. Service was fine and relatively quick. Will visit again. You need to book if you want to eat before 8

We went to Meat N Chill as suggested by one of our friends. It was my first time here. Heard their ribs are famous, but decided to try the steak instead... I had no regrets, the steak portion is great, succulent and perfection done to my likely. Grilled with an aromatic flavour and comes with a generous portion of side dishes. It is also well marinated nad appetising. Definitely will be returning to try their ribs

I ordered the deluxe platter on my first visit during mother's day and I was blown away by the variety and amount of food on the platter- ribs, steak, jumbo prawns etc. It was enough for 3 or more persons. To make things better, the food quality was not compromised. Usually jumbo-sized prawns are not fresh and more of a gimmicky feature of the menu in most restaurants. However, it went beyond my expectations - it is succulent and nicely done. You could really taste the sweetness of the meat. On my second trip with a couple of my friends,I ordered kurobuta pork chops. It is nicely done to my satisfaction. Both the quality and portion justifies the 36 dollars. The service by the staff was also generally good. You could tell that they are serious about the food they served because they make it a point to check if the food was prepared to our liking. However, the mussels were served lukewarm. It would be better if it can be served hot. Maybe, the place was packed with customers even on a Tuesday evening. This only goes to show how popular they are. There are still some minor improvements to be made but I believe it can be achieved given the attention they paid to the food quality and customer feedback. Kudos, Meat and Chill

Nice cosy ambience to chill and for meet ups! Ordered the truffles angus steak, it tastes very unique. A must try for truffles lovers, together with the crispy crust ! Mashed potatoes has an excellent mix with small potato chunks to chew on!Not to mention the convenient location near Six Avenue Downtown Line Station

Made a reservation of 4 on a Friday night. Ambience was great and restaurant was spacious. 4 of us shared a plate of platter, meat was rightly done with the complementing sauces. Salmon that was so fresh and perfectly done. A perfect place for friends hangout.Would surely recommend this to other friends
5
Made a reservation for my group to celebrate the end of our final examinations and also to catch up with the lads. We got ourselves the meat platter for 4 and it was truly amazing. Firstly, we had no difficulty at all with locating the store and with the new downtown line, it made traveling there much easier. It's just 5 mins away from 6th Ave MRT stop. Waiting time was reasonable and the customer service was great. She gave us good recommendations and made us feel at home. We had our steak medium rare and it was really succulent. Paired with the red wine sauce, it was great. The chicken was good too, crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. The salmon was fresh and yummy. Everyone loved the ribs the most. It was rich in flavor and the sauce made it truly finger licking good. Being guys, we got lazy with our fork and knife, we resorted to using our hands for the ribs. Each and everyone of us licked our fingers clean, it was that good. The free flow sides that came along was pretty good as well. Buttered corn, garden salad and golden fries. Perhaps the staff were busy that night due to the full house but we would have preferred them to be more proactive in refilling our drinks and sides. But that's understandable. All in all, we had a really good experience at Meat n Chill. Good food paired with a laid back atmosphere made catching up with friends a real enjoyment.

There was a funky smell when we entered, nonetheless we decided to try. The restaurant was messy, cartons everywhere. Wait staff was polite and prompt with the customers but shouting and cursing each other near the counter and kitchen area which made dining really unpleasant.I enjoyed the ribs and the truffle fries that we ordered. Sadly, the Ribeye steak was below par. The sides were awful, under-seasoned and some just taste bad.
4
Situated at 6th avenue and you might miss this restaurant if you are not frequent patrons around the neighbourhoods. Foods are delicious and with reasonable price. Love the ribs and Mac & cheese.
4
Great food, cooked extremely well. The ribs and steak were the best parts. Thanks to the chef!
Service could be stepped up a bit but that's something that could be worked on.
I would go back again.
5
Great and delicious food with an amazing ambience that made the visit an overall pleasant one. Try the pork ribs and Salmon! A definite recommendation and will definitely come back again.
5
food was good, service was pretty fast and good too. very good place to hang out and catch up with friends. definitely recommended for meat lovers.
3
Buffalo wings were very good and we didn't regret ordering that. The Truffle Augus steak was rather rare though we asked for Medium Rare. The truffle taste sort of overwhelms the taste of the steak itself. Place was rather noisy so I would recommend it for gatherings with friends rather than quiet and chill chats.
4
When we went, there was a promo for a $100 meat platter that fed 4 people, with free flow sides and drinks. It was quite worth it. The food was tasty, and the portions were good, just that service was a little slow. Other than that, good cafe to check out
1
Received a call about 2.5 hours before my 7.30 pm dinner reservation & was informed by a lady staff that 'due to unforeseen circumstances' my reservation has been cancelled. After querying her further she informed that business has been so good the previous 2 days that they had run out of food & can't get fresh supplies !!! My my ... Don't know how good the food is at this restaurant but will never find out since this episode shows this restaurant doesn't know how to run an F&B business so it's unnecessary for me to waste my time & money there even if they offer any compensation which they did - an almighty 10% discount for my next visit Thanks but no thanks.
1
Was looking forward to be there and upon ushered to our seat, and about to place our food orders, then was told that all food items on the menu has been sold out for the day (and mind you it was at around 2.15pm then) except for the NY Strips
5
Perfect place for a cosy family meal.the food is tastefully presented on a large wooden serving board/tray.The pork spare ribs are delicious and succulent.The chicken is well marinated and crispy.The steak is tender, tasty and done perfectly.not forgetting the variety of sauces.the large portion of fresh & refreshing salad and the free flow ice lemon tea completes the meal so well

It is located within a block just off the main road. If you need parking, call them before your arrival and they will let you know if their lot is available.Foodwise, we had the Cajun chicken and it was crispy yet moist and very delicious, especially the brown gravy. The sides were not as good - the mashed potato and the fries were okay, but the sliced apples was very bland, as was the coleslaw, though it was slightly better.We also ordered the Caribbean ribs - I enjoyed the pineapple, but could not taste the kahlua. I think my wife would have preferred the Kahlua and coffee ribs instead, as she found the pineapple to add too much sweetness.Service was good, and the decor was kirtschy but cute. I especially liked the shelving with the bottles of beer
5
The ambiance is great. Prices of the food is reasonable given its large proportions and the quality is fantastic! My friends and I had a wonderful time there and will be back again for more.
5
I sincerely recommend this truly authentic western restaurant to everyone of all ages. The food quality and taste are amazing and they have never dissapointed. The side dishes were inexpensive and on top of that the portions were so generous! I personally recommend the BBQ pork ribs as it was so shockingly tender and flavourful. It was amazing and to close the deal order for dessert the cheesecake was to die for
4
we had a good meal here on Saturday night! service was prompt and we didn't have to wait too long. tried the pork ribs - southern something, and kahlua - both really good! beef short ribs were not bad, and the sausage platter was considerable. perhaps the sides could have been a bit better - the corn was a bit cold, and the mashed potato not that interesting.
5
My experience at Meat N Chill was probably good and probably one of my best restaurant experience I had. Food and ambience there was so good and appropriate for groups of friends seeking a chill place to eat. Tried their Grilled Cajun Chicken and Chili Cheese fries and they are very delicious. The portions given are quite satisfying. I would totally recommend it to my friends and also go back for more good food
5
Awesome place to be! The setting is nice and relaxing. And of course their food is excellent with great variety using top quality ingredients. Their Chili Cheese fries looked fantastic and were very flavorful and crispy. I especially liked their beef steak wish was very juicy and tender. Their desserts were good too. Definitely a must try and I'll be coming back for more with even more people

Great place with great ambience! Visited them on a thurs night. I was really puzzled why the place was quite empty. You guys are definitely missing out! The first thing that caught my eye was the cute and very nicely designed menu. Even the font of the menu is nice!  Both the menu and the walls of the restaurant were decorated with extremely cute graffiti. I cant help but explore the place. Did I not mention that they also provide board games on the 2nd floor? Would definitely consider holding some small scale events here!Food wise, their ribs is a must try! Had their Honey Mustard Ribs as well as the Tuscan Ribs. Both were very flavourful and the meat was tender and nice. They are also not stingy with the portion. So I highly recommend this place. Very value for money! $20+++ for ribs and 2 sides
3
Great ambience and friendly hosts! Gave us free glasses of milk to ease our fiery tongues. The portion they served my friends and I were so huge we sat and ate for hours! The steak and ribs were marinated and cooked perfectly to suit our tastebuds. It was a great visit and they deserve more meat-lovers to visit to grab a bite
5
Had a chillout session with my friends at Meat N Chill and was quite impressed by the quality of food.First off, the ambience of the cafe was pretty good, especially the cute wall graphitti. You can also see them along the stairs up to the second floor which looked like a really great place to hold small events in private.The service was pretty good albeit some small misunderdtandings in the beginning.The food variety was not alot but I felt that this was good as it had the main groups and helped us decide alot faster.The food quality and quantity impressed me! The 4 of us share 3 mains and still felt really full after the meal! The serving size of the ribs was bigger than expected! We ordered 2 pork ribs (honey mustard and tucan) and a salmon. I felt that both were good but tucan suited my taste alot better as it was slight spicy and honey mustard was a little sweet for me. The salmon had fish roe on it and the skin was crispy enough! For the quality and quantity, the price is really value for money!All in all I had a great time there and would definitely recommend those staying nearby to drop by from time to time to chill with family and friends! Although abit secluded, i think the opening of the neaby mrt "sixth avenue" of walkable distance (5min?) really helped the location
5
We ordered the ribs and the steak and I must say I'm impressed with the quality and quantity of food that was served. The portion of ribs that was served was so huge and it was delicious. The meat simply fall off the bones. The steak was done perfectly(we ordered medium rare). Service was good. Overall, I had to say that it was an enjoyable experience
5
Their Crispy Skin Grilled Salmon is a must try! The salmon fillet is dressed with Tobiko cream sauce. The sauce is not overly-creamy which overpowers the taste of the salmon. The sauce compliments the salmon fillet! Salmon skin is crispy and flavourful too. They have a variety of side dishes too! I picked Mashed potatoes and Southern biscuit. Mashed potatoes had a good texture to it! Emptied the entire container. Southern biscuit was well baked too. Overall, great place to hang out! Definitely recommended
