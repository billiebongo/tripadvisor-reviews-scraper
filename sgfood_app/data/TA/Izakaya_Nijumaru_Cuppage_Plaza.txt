Came back here again for another visit this week. This time they had a tuna sashimi lunch set, also for $11 all in. Service was prompt and the food quite reasonable for this price range. Worth visiting again.

You need a local person to approach such a small place. Food is just ordinary and medium quality. Service is fast.

Excellent Lunch set only $10 nett! Small restaurant, limited seats, so need to make reservations. lunch time 12-2.30pm. Cuppage Plaza, an old shopping centre (with many local eateries), off main road. Day time this is very popular with nearby office crowd. Evening, popular with karaoke/pubs.

A great place for Japanese food, especially if you are the kind that likes a bit of everything style of Japanese cuisine. I have most likely tried almost everything on the menu. If its your first time, be sure to order the Beef Steak with Miso Sauce, if Beef is not your thing, well anything from the grill taste awesome

Came here for lunch yesterday with a friend, my 2nd visit to this place. The set lunch is only $11 all in for a bento box (deep fried oysters this time). At this price it's really very good value. Arriving shortly after 12 we were served quite quickly too. Worth another visit

Came for dinner. ordering the food was an unpleasant experience. Waitress was pushy with certain dishes and kept interrupting while we were talking. Asked for seaweed salad and she started going on about her potato salad. food came quite quickly which was good. Sashimi -> sliced without any finesse whatsoever. Huge thick salmon slices.. might as well write 'salmon steak' on the menu. Salad was bad. Grilled saba on the other hand was good. A rather unpleasant experience overall

walked in with a friend for friday dinner, and waited for a few minutes. service was prompt and the ordering experience was enjoyable because the server understood what we liked and recommended relevant dishes from the daily specials. we got the bento set, eel with tempura bento, grilled mushrooms, and the daily special of salmon belly sashimi. the sashimi just melted in our mouths and i enjoyed the eel set very much

Chanced upon it on a random Wednesday after strolling around Orchard& Somerset. Liked it so much that we visited it again on Friday of the same week. Do expect a long queue if you would come on Fridays, but it is still a good place to catch up with friends or just to unwind and chill. After all, they have quite a lot drinks for just $5.. and they also have great live music

I have eaten here twice in the last two weeks and have to say that it is about as authentic a cheap Japanese after-work eatery as you will find outside Japan. The service can be a bit erratic but it's good enough if you smile at the overworked ladies and don't ask to order in one language when they are serving in another. All the food is excellent; standouts for us were the eel, the pork belly, all the grilled skewers (the shrimp and pork were very tasty), the tempura. You may never graduate to leaving your labelled sake bottle behind the bar but this place also passes both the do-japanese-eat-here and the value-for-money tests. A reservation is a good idea unless you come very early or late. If you do chance it and get turned away there are several other small Japanese places in the building as well
