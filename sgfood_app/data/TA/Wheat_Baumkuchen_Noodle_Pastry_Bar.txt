Soba is easily digest, thus having it for dinner. Soba toss with either sesame or yuzu sauce. Delicious and refreshing.

I ordered teriyaki salmon with soba noodle. The serving size was just right. And it taste delicious, the only minus is just the place very small.

Came here for dinner. The serving size was just right. Both the teriyaki chicken with brown rice and the salmon with noodles are nice. The shop is located at the basement of One Raffles Place.

Yummy. Great value. Healthy. Totally recommend the soba and salmon, maybe teriyaki chicken if you just came from the gym and you're on one of those journeys.But seriously, Wheat must own shares in the plastic factory. Plastic cups. Disposable chopsticks. Packaging like whoa.Get up on that team. I never felt so guilty eating salad

I tried their well marketed healthy collagen soup ramen with char siew today (that is what brought me here). I liked the meal for its freshness and simplicity of taste. It is fuss free yummy food! Rates are competitive and they have a lot of excellent lunch options. Looking forward to trying one of their rice or soba bowls. Service was quick and it was easy to find a table after 12.45 pm on a Monday. Note: i dined at the raffles mrt branch.

I usually have my favorite grilled salmon over soba or over brown rice. The taste is just so good. It has fresh lettuce greens and carrots underneath. Today, I tried a new item - chicken breast over soba. It comes with sunny side egg and half an avocado. Also come with lettuce. The flavor of the chicken appeals well, with its mildly spicy tone and toasted sesame seeds. The avocado tames it with its creamy goodnes. Healthy meal made appetizing. Wheats does this so well.

The grilled salmon and teriyaki chicken is the most popular. Nowhere else can we find grilled salmon fillet with 3 sides at $10. i.e. Soba noodles, Salmon fillet, mushroom, lettuce. Every 6 months there are new item coming up and 1 or 2 old one phased out. They stopped the shirataki noodles which I personally like. Now there is the red rice instead of brown rice which is actually easier to eat comparing to brown rice

I have been a frequent buyer of their (grilled) salmon salad/soba, and I pretty much eat exclusively this from this stall. It is part of the health movement in the CBD and the meals are supposedly less than 500 calories, which is why I started having this regularly (to cut down calorie intake).I used to find the salmon overcooked, but will just eat and buy it all the same because they give quite a generous cutting for just $10. However, recently I find that the quality of the grilled salmon has improved somehow and the meat is no longer overcooked and flaking dry. Not sure if it's just my standards dropping (I hope not especially after all the festive feasting), but I would rather think that they got a new chef or cook who knows how to time their grill better.I can't comment on their other offerings because I have not tried them in recent times (or perhaps never at all)

This must be one of the worst meals of my life! On a brighter note, breakfast at Coffee Bean has finally found a match.Decided to try Wheat after walking past it once. I guess it was a rash decision as my wife and I found out later. Most probably inspired by the healthy diet onslaught in the CBD area, the food looks similar to the small stalls selling really decent salad with delicious grills in Raffles Place. And that's where the similarity ends. Instead of fresh vegetables, the ones in the salad were actually stale. The fried chicken was so hard that I had to wear my retainers to regain the shape of my upper teeth for the next few days. The salmon will do better if it were still alive while the soba was a sorry mess. I have not seen tofu served in the shape of the original packaging , hidden under shaved carrots and cucumbers before. I actually had a good laugh before attempting to eat what I could. Gudetama looks more like a real egg than the egg that is added on.Lastly, I do not understand why a place that seemingly wants to reduce carbon footprint (through the consumption of vegetables and less meat) use plastic cutlery and cardboard plates. Maybe that's a hint to the taste of the food. Consumers beware
