Beautiful wall graffiti. Waiter was patient and friendly. The quesadillas was lovely. French onion soup a bit sour, didn't like it. But the rest were fantastic!

Attracted by the live music I stopped for a drink.
The abience called for more and we ordered tapas, wine and cold cuts.
The owner was honest and engaging.
We ended our evening there as we enjoyed the food so much.
Would recommend this absolutely.

Reasonably priced alcohol and a warm atmosphere cannot go wrong. The staff are real friendly and the desserts are nice.

OK, I don't live in Singapore so things there seem more expensive to me. But still, this place serves random French food and unknown champagne, and it's very very expensive. We just had a bite before dinner there and I payed 30 per person.Not worth the try

Love this place! Amazing sauvignon and great quality tapas. Such a lovely atmosphere at the weekend, where you can dine outside and listen to the live music. The owner is so friendly and polite and you really could be anywhere in the world when you visit Le Frenchie! Would definitely come back again and again

And croc Monsieur are very very good.We took some rosé wine with and surprisingly it was a very great one.Not too expensive, we surely had a great food experience with a great time

We found this lovely piece de resistance just minutes away from our hotel in the Indian quarter in Singapore. It is situated in a small street where the road is blocked off and restaurants flow onto the road. People wander around dreamily from restaurant to restaurant in no particular hurry just looking and seeing. The Happy Hour Champagne sign drew me in, next checked the menu which was well priced, with a good selection of wholesome meals with antipasta selections. The art work on the walls is as vibrant as the lovely restaurant owner. We loved it $10 champagne, and a simple meal with great taste. Lovely French music in a quiet spot in Singapore. Back again of course:

We stopped in for a quiet refreshing drink (wine and a beer) and we were not only welcomed warmly but the service was exceptionally friendly, informal and inviting. The atmosphere was something to be cherished so if you get the opportunity to come here, do it!
