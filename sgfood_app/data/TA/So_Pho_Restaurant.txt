Found this restaurant in the basement of Paragon shopping mall by accident.
Casual restaurant and looked popular. I ordered noodle with grilled chicken. The taste was good and acceptable.
Friendly service for such a casual restaurant.

Well finally i am so happy when i saw this restaurant named as PHO. First time try this food in singapore and the taste so funny and weird .
4
Serves authentic vietnamese dishes, and HALAL too. If you have visited Vietnam and tasted their local food, and miss them, please visit So Pho..their food is so good and tastes great. However please prepare to pay a premium price due to its prime location.

My Pho was perfect, Kari's food was meh.
Service was slow and disorganized.
Price was a little steep for what you got.
4
Try this nice viet food joint located at Vivo City. Dishes are fresh, reasonably priced and portions huge. Incidentally its halal and baby friendly.
4
It was a gem we discovered at Paragon mall on orchard road. The food was excellent and good value for money. Must try the chicken curry and the chicken mince salad.
4
We set Paragon as our meeting point because the mall is not a crowded place in Orchard Rd.After met some friends we looked for a place that could cater the 10 of us.We chose So Pho, and the waiter were so friendly arranged our tables and took our orders. All the foods came in proper time and tasted good. More than 2 hours we enjoyed our lunch plus a great talk.Really enjoyed our small reunion here

I am a frequent patron of this branch as I work nearby. It’s HALAL, price is affordable, food is served within 15 minutes even though when it’s full house. I am never disappointed with their service. If you want to avoid waiting in a long queue, avoid lunch hour, there is always a queue at this hour. And this food chain have delivery service and self collect service. I always order online and have it collected at the suggested time
5
The food is delicious. My wife and I discovered this restaurant a couple of years ago and return each time we holiday in Singapore.We are not able to eat foods containing chilli and the team at So Pho are very helpful in recommending dishes that don't contain it.The Fresh Noodle with Grilled Lemongrass Chicken and Fried Spring Rolls is my wife's favourite and I like the Vietnamese Fried Rice with Seafood. Thank you Quey for being so friendly and helpful. See you next year
5
This is our go-to restaurant for halal pho. We have been to 3 other outlets and this one seems to be the most consistent in terms of taste, for the food and drinks. Service is relatively fast and friendly, unlike some of the other outlets. The rice wrap rolls are a must for that fresh, non-sinful mouthful of vegetables, vermicelli and seafood/meat (your choice).The portions are noticeably smaller now though I feel that it is made up by the attention given by the service staff
5
One of the best Pho I ever tasted ! The service was prompt and great too ! Relaxing atmosphere ! The Fried Rice was spicy as well, better than expected !
2
Fresh Noodle with Grilled Lemongrass Fiillet Fish and Fried Spring Rolls is so blend, no taste at all even after I added some sauce. Glass noodle with beef is just as bad. Mixed appetizer & Mango salad are the only edible ones.
1
Food was average. Service was terrible. No cutlery (had to ask twice), no napkins and the final straw was when my change (coins) was thrown down on the counter at me.
5
My wife had a craving for Vietnamese food and found So Pho in a halal food website for Singapore. We decided to give it a try on our second last day in Singapore.So Pho is a tiny restaurant so you might have to wait a while for a table is you go during peak hours ie. lunch. We had to wait a few minutes for a table even at 3pm. The menu was quite extensive with starters, main courses and desserts. We had the Vietnamese wrap for starters and beef soup noodle, chicken soup noodle, beef fried noodle and chicken curry for mains. All the meals were very tasty and delicious. We have been to a few Vietnamese restaurants where the beef soup noodle tasted just like boiled water. The service was efficient but could have been friendlier. We didn’t have to wait long for our food and it was served promptly. Pricing was average as it cost us S$ 97, tax included, for a meal of 4 people. Highly recommended if you’re looking a good Vietnamese meal.

Wanting a piping hot pho, my big sister and I checked out So Pho at the Paragon Food Court. Good we went early because it was packed by dinner time (6-7 p.m.). The pho was piping hot and authentic Vietnamese home cooking with the sprouts and lime on the side. The spring roll and fried lumpia were average. The pho was still the star of the show and it didn't disappoint. Service was quick and efficient
4
Tucked away at one corner in Paragon, this casual dining restaurant serves good Vietnamese dishes. Prices are comparable to NamNam. On a crowded weekend, you're more likely to find seats available here because there's more traffic on the opposite side of the road. Give it a shot
5
We found this place by accident, waiting for the queue to clear at the entrance to the restaurant in the basement food court in Paragon mall. Because it was so popular decided to go in and weren't disappointed. The best Vietnamese food we have ever tasted at a great price. Grilled lemongrass chicken noodles, vietnamese pancake with meat and seafood, iced lime tea and pinapple soda freeze, all for $37? delicious. Venue a bit manic and like a firms cafeteria, but food tremendous
4
We had brunch here, and not only we ordered our favorite foods (pho soup and goi cuon), but we also ordered fresh vermicelli with tofu (bun dau) and fried pho. We all liked the foods, and the portion was just enough for our brunch. If you are looking for rather light yet good meals, this is the place you ought to be. Try it on
4
It was a pleasant surprise on my recent trip to the restaurant, I ordered the beef noodle soup with beef ball, the taste of the soup has much improved. However the beef ball still need improvement. It is not sufficiently chewy and the taste was blunt. Hope can see improvement in the next visit
3
Simple restaurant with standard street favorites of Vietnam. The starter dishes were good and accompanying sources were just correct for it. The Pho was filled with enough ingredients and content but lack the kick. The beef flavor could have been stronger. Sugar cane prawns were good. The bun seow was good. Overall not a bad place and full filling, just needs a little kick.
3
Reasonable price at Orchard area and nice taste. We also tried the curry chicken, which was nice too.
4
Ate quickly 3 courses at the restaurant. Total sum around 20s$. The ice tea was the higlight but nothing to complain about the food.
5
We had a delicious lunch served in a beautifully designed and hygienic restaurant setting. The menu includes a vast range of noodles (pho), rice and vegetable dishes. The choice of drinks does not
3
I'm not sure whether it's really authentic pho because I've been told by the staff that it might not be. Nonetheless the food is great! Not too overpricy also. But not that much variety. Went to the outlet at Tampines. Service was okay.
4
Ate four times within a four week period, and see myself coming back for more! The broth used in the pho orders is rich and savoury. Helpings are generous, especially the stir-fried noodle dishes. Service is friendly, and prices are affordable to the general public.
2
Ambience was overall ok. See other staff as friendly but our order taker Catherine wasn't in good mood. I'm here right now at the restaurant and trying to enjoy the chicken soup noodle. Ordered also a mix appetizer which was good. But the chicken in the noodle was thick and terrible shapes and chunky. Too tough to bite n ugly to look at. The soup stock was good so the chicken ingredient was a very disappointing issue.
2
Went there on Friday night. We love Vietnamese food, but the food served in So Pho is so far from the good Vietnamese food that we remember from Vietnam that it's was really disappointing. Prices are OK for what you get but this is not the place to eat if you understand something in Vietnamese food
5
Came here for a quite bite as it's near our hotel. It's located on B1 where all the restaurants are.Order is simple. You look at the picture menu, fill up the form, hand the form to the servers and all the food and drinks came fast in less than 10 minutes.All dishes are of decent serving sizes, delicious and clean. Exactly what you see in the pictures. No cheating.Prices are reasonable as well. Recommended
4
We found this lovely clean place by chance. A busy lunchtime but excellent fast service. We adored the simple Vietnamese food in the small menu offered. Tasty, super fresh, great flavours. We would most certainly return on our next visit.This lovely eatery is located in a busy shopping centre called Paragon. Easy to find
5
This is not my first time reviewing So Pho. I have decided to review again as I have ordered different food item and also because I feel that the service has improved.This time I was rather surprise when the food I have ordered arrived faster than my previous visit. Probably, less crowd has contributed to the speedy service but I still I think I have to credit mention it.Food wise was good but I hope that one day, So Pho will be able to serve Summer Roll that consist of only 1 type of meat and that's prawn instead of having chicken in the roll too.As usual, the lychee freeze is a bomb! Very delicious..
3
This is the second time visiting this outlet/restaurant, and this time it's just not a success. Everything tasted bland, not too authentic either. For the price, better quality was expected.
Service is quite speedy and friendly.
5
After getting into Singapore late and tied we came across this restaurant and was so glad we did, like it so much the we come back on our last nice. Food was great fresh and hot, thank you.
4
Went here with my Vietnamese wife and we both loved the food and went back 2 more times. Would recommend.
5
Still my main choice for meals in Singapore. It's halal. We enjoy the papaya salad, Pho sukiyaki and vietnamese spring rolls
5
Stumbled upon this gem after walking long distances to shop. Beef pho broth was light, spring rolls were very refreshing. Drank one of the signature tea with jelly and it was a delight! The waitress was friendly and food came fast. Will definitely recommend to others and come again
2
I was in S'pore and decided to bring my hubby for Vietnamese food and decided to eat at the outlet in Paragon as we wanted to shop around in Orchard Road.There was no Q..but place was quite packed.There were 6 of us and when the food came...they just placed them at one corner of the table and walked away!We were supposed to figure out ourselves what the item was...and when dessert came...the mangoes were extremely sour and we couldn't eat them with the sticky rice!Told the waiter about it and he replied..."Once u order,u cannot cancel!"I told him to approach the supervisor/manager to cancel it before I make a complaint as we didn't and couldn't eat them!He came back and said the dessert has been cancelled.This will be my last time eating here...food was so-so and service sucks big time

After some busy busy shopping at Paragon Mall over a Christmas Sale weekend, it makes sense to head to the Basement for a fabulous range of eateries! Today we decided to take a shot at Vietnamese fare and So Pho was a sheer delight! The bubbly ambience & the colourful interior catches your attention immediately. Even on a busy Sun afternoon, the enterprising hostess managed to get us a table for six. Being vegetarian, we were somewhat restricted in choice, but there were enough yummy options to go around. For Starters, we went in for Fresh Springrolls & Mango Papaya Salad. Our Main Course choices were Veg Fried Rice & Veg Fried Noodles. Both were simply mouthwatering with a unique taste. Also Banh Mi Veg. Our drinks choices were Lychee Freeze & Lemon Grass Ice Tea. Just the kind of lunch break one needed to pursue Christmas Shopping with gusto!
5
Tired after shopping in Paragon? This is excellent restaurant to rest & eat! The dessert menu looks tempting..but after a bowl of pho (noodles), cant order anymore! Portion is decent and soup is delicious. Suitable for kids too! Can be long queue, so need to avoid 12-1pm
5
I took my family to So Pho for the first time and we enjoyed the food as well as the drinks. The mojito drinks were very refreshing and the food were well portioned for price. The prawn cakes in the soup was very tasty, and we all enjoyed the spring rolls. The staff were very friendly and provided good service during this busy period.I would recommend this place to anyone who visits Singapore as there food is top standard and the service is very good
4
Tampines mall branch. 10.08.2016My first try at So Pho. We ordered the beef slices + beef balls pho and the other just beef slices pho. The servers didn't mention that there's no more beef balls in the first place and only when the food arrived, they said the beef balls had been replaced by more beef slices. Well, that's rectified so no harm done. :)The appetizer was also not bad. Would return..
4
Its beef Phos and grilled chicken with rice sets are really tasty, my kids simply love them! The fresh rolls, fried spring rolls and prawn with sugarcane are pretty good too, and you can have them all in a platter.
4
I ordered dried chicken pho. My friend loved the beef pho. The papaya salad is good. Service is very fast.
3
Nice pho. Good sriracha chili. Adequate portions. Not expensive given its location in Paragon shopping mall. Nothing to scream about. But it does the trick
5
Great place for Vietnamese cuisine. I had sliced beef & beef balls pho.. Delicious, service is great too.. Price is reasonable and I didn't wait too Long for food to be serve...
4
Order came a bit slow as it's lunch peak hour... Food quality wise it's satisfactory... Spring rolls were tasty, n beef has no smell... Will definitely patronise the restaurant again...
3
Dropped by Novena branch for lunch. The place is always packed during lunch time. Ordered beef noodles with beef slices and balls + lemongrass drink. The food is alright nothing to shout about. Portion is big. The lady supervisor is very attentive and quick.The Chinese man tending the cashier/ manager needs to smile more.The place is clean and seats are comfortable
4
We ordered the following for lunch:beef stew with vermicemango n papaya saladRice vermice with tofuThe beef stew was good although the beef pieces had fat in them. The salad , as expected, was outstanding. The rice vermice with tofu was the best of the three dishes ordered, with lot of greens in it. At SGD 15 per head we found the meal to be decent and value for money
3
I visited this restaurant @Novena today for lunch. The place was packed. Since it's a few office towers neaby this branch did not have Set Lunch special as stated on their FB. I ordered :- Vietnamese seafood Fried Rice which was good, lots of flavor and little spicy. Not much seafood in it. Only tiny piece of shrimp and squid. Rice portion was big to me. - Lotus tea was nice and very hot. The service was attentive. The decorations was nice. I would return to try other menu next time.
4
We weren't disappointed with our experience of So Pho. We found the meals we shared to be tasty and good value at around SGD 14.50 each including drinks. Just watch the ordering system, where we made a mistake in our self-selection and ended up with vegetarian instead of combo fried rice. Still, all was tasty and there was no need to swap
1
Hello, we tried for the first time this restaurant because we are Vietnamese cuisine's lovers and we were so DISAPPOINTED by the food. We ordered many popular food like the Pho soup which was not tasty at all with a lot of Glutamate to enhance the taste. The meat balls had a very strange taste and strange texture. We tried the Bo bun , the meat were too soft and taste wasn't like a real delicious bo bun. The springrolls were soso. My friend in Singapore told me to try a family Vietnamese restaurant in a mall in Millenia W, I forgot the name but it was more like Vietnamese food! I was so disappointed :'o( .
3
I had my first Vietnamese lunch @ paragon ,Sg . outlet with my friends .
The space is quite small but the food is good .
My favorite from there are - seafood fried rice , spicy grilled fish and desserts .
3
Having Pho, several times here.
The food is good, the service is average.
Be careful, this place is packed, specially during lunch time. Prepare to wait in line for 5-10 minutes.
Service just OK....
5
We went here for lunch. I had Pho Bo (cannot remember what my husband had). Best Pho I have had outside Ho Chi Minh City. Friendly staff, well priced food and drinks. Service was quick and clean and lovely decor. It is in The Paragon Plaza on Orchard Rd. if I was a local I would go here all the time
3
Had lunch here with the family as they were offering lunch sets for $9.90 each before taxes.Service was okay, though the food did take a while to come out. In fact, we saw a couple of diners chasing the waitstaff for their meals.The fried beef noodles was okay, though there were only three small beef pieces each in our two plates. The chicken curry with rice was much better, while the half-set of grilled chicken was small and did not have rice or noodles. It also needed more lemongrass in the marinade.For a Vietnamese restaurant, the sets did not have anything remotely Vietnamese. They could and should have offered a Viet spring roll, in addition to the drink.Overall, it was an okay meal, though not remotely Vietnamese by any name
4
The restaurant is located in the basement of the Paragon Shopping Mall. There are many choices of places to eat on this level. Most restaurants open at 11:30 however So Pho was already open at 11:15 so we gave it a try. the food was quite good and service was efficient. As we were leaving the entire restaurant was full (within about half an hour) The prices are reasonable and it is a good place for a quick lunch
4
'So Pho' has become one of my go-to food stops when in Orchard area because apart from the good food they serve, they also happen to have some of the more efficient staff around. It is of little wonder then that the place is always packed during lunch and dinner period and people are even willing to queue for the next available table. The prices of their meals and drinks are also on the reasonable side. My favourite dishes are: vietnamese spring rolls, grilled lemongrass chicken and their mango-pomelo ice blend. The chicken pho is also quite tasty with its yummy clear soup. Oh, and their lemongrass drink is helluva wonderful
5
We stayed at a hotel across the street from the mall and walked over to find food. All 4 of us were happy with our choice of So Pho. The food was good and our server was very patient with Americans who weren't used to eating Vietnamese food. Would definitely return
3
Went to Tampines Mall.Food delivery especially drinks took a while to be served and asked the staff twice!Soup noodles not worth the price but rice dishes and other selections wasn't too bad .Seating arrangement and ambience was acceptable despite a busy mall.Disappointed with the temperature of the food as it was not hot as expected .Would be better if staff can take the order instead of the customers writing themselves since service charge added to the bill
4
This restaurant is in the Paragon shopping mall on Orchard Rd. We had flown into Singapore early that morning, and were looking for an Asian dinner near our hotel. So Pho turned out to be a pleasant place to sit down and eat our first meal in Singapore. We were unfamiliar with the method of writing down what you want to order on a sheet for the wait staff, but they were tolerant of us newbies. Both dishes we ordered were new to us, but tasty.Restaurant staff were quick and efficient. It isn't a place that encourages lingering, but a fine first experience for us
4
New in Parkway Parade. Rather small eatery. Go early to avoid queue. Food is yummy, although the pho servings are a bit small. Prices are the average restaurant pricing eg $9-10 for a bowl of pho, a rice bowl/set. I was impressed with its customer service. Without knowing that the seafood fried rice was spicy, my son ordered it. When he couldn't eat it because it was too spicy for him, the staff volunteered to replace it with a new non-spicy bowl of fried rice instead. Staff were also polite. Sure going back again
4
The Pho was good as were the drinks.
The service was mixed/average & the decor/facilities are "no frills" but functional.
4
2nd time to the restaurant. Ordered the Pho Bo (rice noodles with beef), spring roles (wrap in rice paper) and vietnamese ice coffee with condense milk. Tried the mango and glutinous rice dessert as well. Delicious and reasonably priced. Cost around $20 per head.
4
Had the beef pho soup and was glad to have it come with the beef slices cooked right and not in a clump. The broth had had a balanced taste and you can garnish it to your liking.
4
While on Holidays we found this place which is located in Paragon Shopping centre.We liked it so much that we went in one week 3x.Its fresh tasty food and prices are not bad.Service except the young guy wasn't very friendly but it is a casual place with table service. I think they dont care much.I liked the Fried Rice with beef !!!On our next visit to Singapore we will be back !!
3
I like the fried rice which has a hint of turmeric flavor. I find the broth of the beef pho is a little bit too sweet. The lemongrass chicken is tasty. The spring rolls are so-so.It is a convenient place in between your shopping or just meeting with friends
2
Was at So Pho Paragon on 15 Dec 2015 with familyService Staff not friendly or courteous.The waitress just placed our food on the table and walk away which is so rudeAnyway we will not visit again.Beef on pho was tough, soup bland. Fried rice grain hard and chicken meat tough.The food is average in taste The price is mid rang
4
This is a halal-certified restaurant. The selection on the menu is much broader than other similar restaurants. The signature pho was good although my preference is for a slightly richer soup. Food service was prompt and all the staff were friendly, always smiling despite the demanding dinner crowd on a Friday night. If you run out of food options in Paragon, you will find something to fill up here
2
Nice restaurant layout and design. However, not really Vietnamese. Soups don't have rich flavour - I hope the owner once travels to Vietnam and improves the menu. But biggest concern is service. While there's a lot of staff, no one cares. Order came wrong, we waited 15min (and asked 3 times) for some chili. In short, go to food court and you get better service and a more Vietnamese dish
4
Went to Tampines mall branch for weekend lunch. Restaurant was full but service was prompt. Waiter who took our order seems to remember dishes by code number, impressive.Good selection of food was on offer. For appetizers we ordered Vietnamese rolls both traditional as well as oriental (deep fried). Traditional one was delicious with chicken and prawn fillings. main course was seafood fried rice and Vietnamese chicken curry served with bread. Curry was traditional but bread was hard and disappointing.Seafood rice was tasty but a bit oily and portion size smaller.Overall, service was fast, efficient and dishes were reasonably priced. A good option for delicious viet lunch at Tampines

I live in America and have always enjoyed the simplicity and nutritious food served in Vietnamese restaurants. So Pho is a bustling little restaurant in lower level of the Paragon shopping mall was jam packed (always a good sign), and they took Vietnamese to another level for me.Handwriting on their wall bragged on their broth and how any old soup couldn't claim to be Pho. They came through with a piping hot bowl that was not only delicious, it was peppered with a few tiny little red chiles that blew my mouth away and shocked my socks off. I had a spring roll that had beef and mango in it, amongst other delicious and unrecognizable ingredients which thrilled my palate. Such a treat and an expansion of the routine bowls I get in America. Pho Rocked my world and put a smile on my face. After returning to my hotel, I encountered a couple who had also eaten there and who saw me. They too were delighted and we exchanged high fives on the meals before we retired to our rooms
