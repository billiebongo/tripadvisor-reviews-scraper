Took family to dinner recently. Food very good generally, particularly the skewered meat dish. Paella not so good, a bit dried and not much character. Most tapas dishes excellent. Sangria very good and excellent value at two for price of one. Service ok. Under $200 for four which was much better than I remembered

I stumbled upon Bodega y Tapas some years back while googling for authentic Spanish tapas in Singapore. This was a good hit and I loved the 1-for-1 happy hour till 9pm. The restaurant also produced close-to-authentic as possible Spanish tapas (esp pulpo, patatas bravas, huevos dishes, lots of jamon) and the friendly pinoy waitresses were always on hand with prompt service.All changed when it became Amuse. Definitely not amused, cuisine was not what it used to be with a new concept and the price point was out of whack.Until it reverted back to Bodega y Tapas end 2013 and I started heading back. B&T is a great bustling place to hang out at without being too noisy, at the end of Orchard Rd and yet still central enough to grab public transport home after ODing on the 1-for-1s.The tapas are TDF for most seafood dishes and I love the Pimientos de Padron served on Friday nights
