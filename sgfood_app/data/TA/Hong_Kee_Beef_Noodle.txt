Beef is tender, will be better if cuts are bigger and the noodles gravy are more "flavourfull". Overall, not a wow but average taste.

This stall is better than another one at the same hawker centre. The soup is more tastier and the beef is not over cooked. And it is also better than Empress place beef at siglap.

The beef noodle is springy, the broth is tasty, the beef is tender and juicy. Be prepared for long queue during lunch hours. Self-service.

I have been eating at this stall since they were at Cuppage and run by their father when they were there. Now it is run by a brother and sister team. Best thing is they speak english and no request is too diffcult for them to cater to. My recommendation when ordering is order a bowl of dry version with noodles, than let them know you want to soup version without noodles but with the beef

Hong Kee Beef Noodles come in 2 varieties: dry and soup. We ordered both and my personal choice is the soup version. The soup version has a tinged of salted vegetables to it, which is one of my favourite type of soups. The noodles are beautifully done and the entire meal was just excellent for only a few Singapore dollars. It doesnâ€™t surprise me that this place got its Bib Gourmand. It was delicious

This is certainly the best value for money Wanton Noodles you can find the Central Business District. Located in the popular Amoy Street Food Centre. They are on the second level #02-125. The gentleman is always busy slicing the char siew (Barbecue Pork) but trust me just tell him what you want to eat as he's very good at multi tasking. A plate of nice wanton noodle cost just SGD$3. Eat it and tell me does it worth every single cent. However, as usual in Singapore any nice eating place, you have to QUEUE! So bear with it and I assure you will not regret. Enjoy

Just enjoyed a big beefy soup and dinner - that was more than hearty feeding & I'd recommend to anybody to try.A little spicy, but could be bolstered up to extra hot if desired. Opens early doors to late at night. The owner/server was very accommodating, a good guy
