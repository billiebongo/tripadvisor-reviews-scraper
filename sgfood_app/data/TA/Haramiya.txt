I don't know much about Korean nor Japanese food, but the menus have pictures, and the food was brilliant.

Haramiya is a really great korean / japanese BBQ in the heart of Singapore. I am addicted to the food, the price is ok and the service is great. Highly recommend it!

I went here for a quick lunch. I opted for one of the lunch specials: the salmon bibimbap. Price was very reasonable and the food was excellent. Staff was friendly and efficient. Ideal for a quick meal. Would definitely go back here. I would love to try the other dishes on the menu

I visited one evening and had the buffet $39.99 buffet selection. I thought this was great value as I had a selection of salmon sashimi which was delicious before I had some BBQ meats / seafood. Service was very good - staff were friendly and attentive. I'd recommend the place. Sashimi made it for me though you can opt for set meals or a la carte

Today I had lunch at another Japanese BBQ Restaurant - Haramiya, located at 6 Eu Tong Sen Street #03-87 The Central, Singapore 151897. The number to dial is 6534 9468. This is an interesting Japanese restaurant that also serves Korean dishesThe menus comprise of many items - beef sets, pork sets, chicken sets, and cooked items such as Biblimbap sets as well as rice dishes.Finally the meals were being served. The Korubuta Pork set lunch (SGD$15.99) - consisting of tender strips of black pork, a salad with sesame paste gravy, water-melon slices, a bowl of Miso Soup, a bowl of Japanese rice and small plate of Kimchi. We had to grill the meat ourselves, which made dining fun and enjoyable, engaging everyone literally. The Korubuta Pork is tender and the meat is sweeter and softer than normal pork, and of course when grilled to crispiness, it was utterly tasty.The Karubi Beef set lunch (SGD$14.99) - well marinated and succulent slices of beef that, too, when grilled to perfection, filled the tastebuds with the delicate aroma of good beef. The beef is cut into fine, small slices to make it easy for eating. We experimented with different done-ness for this meat and it still tasted good.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/04/lunch-at-haramiya-japanese-bbq.htm
