Went with my boyfriend and parents and ordered 2 pizzas and 2 pastas. Everything was great and nothing was left!

I was introduced by a friend as it is known as handmade pasta. The location was at a nice corner of the mall. The pasta was alright but the sauces were not up to expectations. Will visit again when they revise the menu.

Went on a weekday and enjoyed great a good lunch - good food, pleasant and quiet ambience. Self-service ordering at the counter, no service charge.

Humble food accompanied by genuine service, would visit again. One of the best yet affordable pasta places around.

A group of six friends had post Christmas meal at Strong Flour. Ambience was casual, yet served Michelin starred food at reasonable price. Crayfish seafood pasta was fantastic!

This is my second visit. On my first visit, I tried their fresh pasta and it was very good. Today, we tried the vongole ( it was not great....I have tasted much better) but the truffle pizza was out of this world and Super! Definitely worth the calories. This place is more like a bistro than restaurant. You have to go to the counter to order your food. The service has been consistently lukewarm (very typical of Singapore service sector). The saving grace is the hearty & good quality food. This is the East where folks are very discerning with value that goes along with the quality of the food. The F&B sector in this area is super competitive. I like to see strong flour survive !!

Everything could have been better, especially the taste of their food. It was quite bland; lacking of salt and pepper for their pasta and their Salmon pizza looks unappetizing. Service was alright and it does get crowded during dinner time. Could have been better but oh wells.

My friends and I ordered a pizza and a seabass filet pasta in tomato cream sauce to share. The pasta portion was small. The taste could have been more balanced, as it was a tad too tangy. The pizza portion was generous and great for sharing

A nice little corner in KatongV. Not super easy to locate..but once you do, you will be awed by their delicious handmade pasta. If you are fussy about service, this place is not for you. They do not take orders at the table, you have to order at the cashier and pay first.Overall, pasta was good

Good pastas and pizzas. Bad experience with the service though; kitchen only seems to have 2 staff and 2 more at the front of house. It’s the weekend and all tables are full. We get our order of pizza first after half an hour which is understandable. Only once we were done with the pizza did the side order of grilled vegetables show up, this side was nothing to rave about unless you love peppers, which was its main component. We continue waiting for another main and once it’s passed an hour of waiting I get up to ask one of the front of house staff who tells me she will check but doesn’t get back to me. I continue waiting and ask the other staff about it, telling her that since it’s been an hour we just want to take it away. All this time there was no apology, we think they actually just forgot the order cause of the chaos going on. When asked if they forgot I was told that no; it’s only cause the kitchen is backed up. An hour and half and to have pasta whilst other tables who arrived after us were served and were nearly done baffles me. When finally given the take away we received an apology and a pint of ice cream, which was a nice gesture. However we would avoid this place on weekends till they have more staff.

The restaurant might be a little hard to locate but the food is delicious and it's definitely value for money. We ordered one main each but the pizza was very huge, the pizza alone is good enough for two!

Like that there are always new specials to try. Every pasta I have had there so far has been good! Seafood stew is very tasty too.

We like the fresh pasta and would like to go back to try the seafood marinara someday. The lemon pie was abit too sour though

Had a family dinner there recently, of all the dishes, the lasagna was the best...
Their homemade pastas did not agree with our tastebuds (maybe it's just us)

Love it!
Strong flour has been dishing out consistently good food. Simple but satisfying meal. Keep up the good work

Excellent meal. Love the texture of the home-made pasta. Tasty ingredients and sauces. Comfortable environment and homely ambience.

A short catch up with my friends over lunch time. Love the think crust pizza and truffles fries. The portion for fries is a lot and good for sharing.

The location is out of the way, we have to work through NTUC to access the resturant. The dinning area is in the middle of a mall's lobby, no ambience, canteen style, self order & pay at the counter. Food are delivered to the table, a la minute, piping hot. The food is excellent, but the other elements are lacking. It cost S$26 per head despite no GST and service charge. A good neighbourhood resturant to fix your need of Italian food

The place advertises freshly made pasta, so we thought we’d give it a go. The pastas were good but not spectacular. In particular, was not impressed by the pepper (both the quality - it felt like the mass-produced with MSG type, and the quantity - my Vongole was drenched it in!). They do have good lunch deals ($16 for a soup, pasta main and a drink) though.

Worst steak I’ve had in a long time. Fries were served cold. When we asked to replace they said OK and then never came back with anything. Ignored us the rest of the night even though we were the only table there
