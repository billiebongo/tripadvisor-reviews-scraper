Don't come here if you're hungry or dislike tao waiters. On the other hand if you have the moo-lah and are willing to fork it out for novel novelty desserts, stop by here after you've had your main meal, else you might need 2 additional mains after discovering the bird-bite sizes of your 1st order. The foie-gras is good, and the rose-ball decor is charming, but don't bother with the soup
