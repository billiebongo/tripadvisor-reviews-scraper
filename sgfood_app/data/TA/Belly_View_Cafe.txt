You can get a great view of the seaside and belly of the air craft flying above you.
They served great roasted chicken and other great dishes

Great open air cafe right on the coastline. The cafe is aptly called Belly view as the bellies of planes flying overhead every minute is clearly visible. That said, it can be incredibly noisy as it is below the flight path of planes taking off from Changi Airport.The views of the seafront is nice and the food great. Go try the chicken, Mongolian tofu etc. All great tasting.What is also good that even though the tables are open aired, the cafe forbid smoking at the tables. Smokers must not smoke at the dining tables. Great

For those who have read my other reviews on Singapore places, you know that I take special note of places that offer tranquility in this bustling and thriving city. The Belly View Cafe is my latest addition to this list. Several reviews suggest visiting on your way to or from the airport. I, on the other hand, suggest that you build this into your itinerary. My husband and I dined there on a Sunday evening with a group of friends. While other reviewers are not raving about the food, I felt it was quite good. We had local fishhead curry which was very tasty. We ordered 2 crocks of the fishhead because there were 9 of us. Yes, the Mongolian doufu is very good as well. We had about 8-9 dishes and our bill came to less than 200 SGD. Perhaps my favourite thing about dining here is the atmosphere. There were the large round tables, some of which are able to accomodate up to 15 people. But there are also small tables suitable for lone dining or small groups. Do keep in mind this is on the beach and you may get a bit of sand on your shoes. The view of the water and the skyline are food for the soul. Come and try for yourself.Sunday evening is a good time to visit. For us, the air temperature was pleasant, the view was nice, the food was delicious, and the social interaction was enriching

Located near Changi Airport and Value for money. Great outdoor (sea view) or indoor seating. You can see air planes flying into Singapore landing in Changi Airport.Local dishes except no pork. We ordered hot plate tau Hu, fried chicken wings, Kang Kong vegetables (spicy), bitter gourd seafood soup etc. You need to take a cab in. Good place for families & friends too.

Re-visited this place after nearly a year.The Good:1. Lovely place by the sea. Probably the only place in Singapore where you have the sea literally under your feet and in your ears! Makes you feel like you're off on some tropical island like Krabi or Bali... That's a unique experience!2. Standard menu as any other local Chinese food joint.3. Decent, prompt, courteous service.4. Reasonably priced.The Not-so-good:1. They often forget to give you some things like serving spoons or plates, or sauces etc.2. It's quite disappointing and frustrating that despite having a completely local menu they don't offer teh or kopi, which can be found in any food-court. Instead, they serve some horrible version of teh or plain black tea

Belly View Cafe ("Stella") is close to Changi Airport and the ferry terminal to Bintan.Very nice place, with always a small wind from the sea and is overlooking the sea with all the ships who are anchored. When it turns dark, all the lights are nice. At same time you can see some airplanes coming in for landing. "Lots to see".Great food selection and nice drinks

It was surprisingly very breezy & amazingly cool on a Wednesday night. Perfect for couples who wants to spend quiet time together to chatter the night away. The Chinese food was to our local taste but the main highlight was the cool & breezy night. There was constant plane taking off too

The Good:Was great to find this lovely, little place tucked away on the far east side of Singapore. Makes you feel like you're on some island in Thailand or the Philippines since the city is far from view and there is only an expanse of ocean and lovely sea breeze. You can also get a lovely sunset sky depending on the time you come here.Nice, regular local food menu.Good service.The Not-so-good:A chicken dish we ordered was not very well cooked. Have had better tasting food at many other food courts around the city.Not very accessible even with own transport. Not sure it's accessible by public transport at all

Regular dinner hangout with boyfriend or friends or family. This place has it all, especially for the airplane fanatics. I'm a huge fan of the fragrance kailan, spring chicken (seasonal) and fish items. My last bill with prawns came up to $120 for 4 pax and we went back with full like teletubbies! They close rather early around 10pm therefore don't be late to avoid disappointment
