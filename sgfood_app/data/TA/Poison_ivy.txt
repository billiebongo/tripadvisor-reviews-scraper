This place is closed on Monday and Tuesday. Local food is fantastic. Get the meal for two, very romantic. Take the time to visit the gardens.

Stingy with food and even sambal it charges $2. Ridiculous!! Would not go there again. Hope the owner will look into the portions and the price. Too expensive place to have a decent nasi lemak meal.

Bollywood Veggies is a great place to go with kids. We always enjoy buying their fresh organic veggies and eat in the restaurant.
The vegetable curry with brown rice is wonderful.

My wife and I were tracking Sungei Buloh Westland Reserve, Lim Chu Kang area and then looking for a place to rest and relax. We found Poison Ivy which served lemongrass and cold coconut drinks.They also served assam pedas and curry chicken and watercress soup (today's special) and Nasi Lemak among others veggie dishes.Great for family with children and couple on bicycle or tracking trail.Ample parking space. Free from the hassle of having to watch your parking time and looking out for traffic warren

Was exploring some of the farms in Kranji area and came across this rare find for good Nasi lemak, at Poison Ivy Bistro. Here you can get lots of fresh farm produce and a huge collection of dishes that is suitable for families and large gatherings. I tried the Nasi lemak platter for 2 that comes with blue rice, 2 chicken wings, scrambled eggs, fragrant ikan bilis w/nuts, tapioca chips, served with the very good sambal chilli and the moringa tempura. The tempura is very crunchy when hot and the blue rice was good but the coconut flavour was slightly missing. You def have to ask for extra sambal to go with the fried chicken.

Tired of the hustle and bustle of the city and endless shopping malls? Escape to Poison Ivy in Sembawang for something different. You won't regret the journey when the food arrives. Fresh produce combined with natural sweetness. It's different every time depending on the harvest. Recommend the Nasi Lemak platter, and the Curry Chicken. Take a slow walk through the farm and feel your stress melt away. If you see Ivy Singh, make sure to stop and chat. She will complete the Poison Ivy experience !

We had a delightful lunch that was served in quirky surroundings. The owner is a character outside the norm and very interesting as well as entertaining. The food was amazing. Watercress soup, chicken rendang, rice served in omelettes, steamed spinach, fish with achar pickle and a desert of banana bread, tapioca and a sticky sweet paste made from gula Melaka. We stayed for ages. The drive out there is fascinating and well outside the normal Singapore tourist jaunt

Stopped in on a hot afternoon while on a motorcycle ride. The air-con was perfect and thanks to the large windows and plants everywhere, I still felt like I was out doors. The coffee and soda water were delicious and inexpensive. The cake was good too. Very reasonable prices for such friendly and skilled service accompanying delicious products. I love this place and will return regularly

The food was super delicious and we ordered the nasi lemak to share and it was made to perfection and the rice was also very fragrant. the dessert kueh was also perfectly done . Highly recommend this place if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of city life ..its almost like dining in paradise..
5
We ordered a veg and non veg platter along with some wine and beer. The food was so delicious. We thoroughly enjoyed the food. Poison Ivy's famous banana bread dessert exceeded our expectations! It was amazing.The staff are kind and attentive. Although it was a busy Sunday afternoon, the staff were always smiling and eager to please their customers! We had a lovely experience here! Would love to visit again.

Visited recently ... very good place for those have interest with the Asian fruits farm .. very agricultural ,.. the restaurant caters an amazing food and I'm very surprised it's very very cheap !!
4
Far from the madding crowd and worth the drive! We tried the Nasi Lemak, Fish Briyani, Jackfruit curry and stir-fried ladies fingers. All nicely done!
4
Reasonably priced and food were nice. We liked the banana bread and the Nasi Lemak. All veggies were homegrown :)
5
nice food, and super delicious deserts!
sometimes, your food will be decorated with a flower from the garden. big +

So this spectacular place is in a veggie farm in Kranjak country side, the food is delicious and the staff are so friendly, if you are lucky enough you might as well meet Ivy and she will give one good story about warriors.You can spend some time exploring the Bolywood farm which has a vast varieties of plants and trees grown in Asia, then you can just have drink to cool off of try one of their exquisite platters.It is a long ride from civilization, but it's worth it.

Visit poison ivy for late lunch.This restaurant is located in garden, so you can enjoy nature.Food seems more original tastes compare to normal food court in SG.(spice bit strong)Operation service is normal nothing special.Price is very cheap almost same as food court in CBD.If you visit bollywood veggies then try this restaurant
4
Just like Bollywood Veggies, the restaurant has really smily service and very good food! I would highly recommend the vegetable platters because you get a wonderful selection of different foods. Also, the banana bread is really great and is made with bananas that were grown right there. Afterwards you can walk through the garden and see exactly what you've been eating. I really loved it
4
Stopped here for lunch during our trip to Bollywood Veggies. There are indoor and outdoor seatings. Good music in the background though it was quite soft perhaps because there were a lot of people. I had the laksa which was really good (this should be how authentic local cuisine ought to taste like) and my friends vouched for that too. My friends had the nasi lemak platter; the white rice, dhal and curry were good. Service was prompt. Most of the service staff were pleasant and friendly. The person who took our orders was less friendly. She told us sharply that she had to go take orders from a new group of people who just came in and left without taking our drinks orders. Other than this incident with the service, I must say the food is the plus point of this place
4
Although Poison Ivy is the only choice when you visit Bollywood Veggies farm, but it will not disappoint you. Their Nasi Lemak is one of the best in Singapore, at least to me. They also use vege that planted in their farm as the ingredient in some their special dishes. Thumbs up for this restaurant
5
Who knew the Singapore has its very own organic farms ! We had amazing chicken curry with paratha here amidst lush greenery and fresh air . We also took some banana bread back home and it was sooo delicious and moist . Perfect place to enjoy a good meal surrounded by nature . Tip - bring the kiddos and they will go bonkers frolicking in the farm
5
Healthy and tasty food, friendly atmosphere. Fruit and vegetables used in the dishes were grown at the place. Desserts were amazing too! A nice place to eat after an informative walk!
4
We ordered the warrior basket (if i didn't rem wrongly) for lunch. It cost $20 and comes with 2 chicken wings, one bowl of chap chay(super like!), one bowl of dhal, one bowl of fried murangi leaves (?)( my husband love this dish), one bowl of chicken curry. We ordered one bowl of mix rice ( brown and white rice) at $1, and fig tea at $2 and aloe vera drink at $3.I really love the warrior basket. For a price of $20, it is really worth it. what's more, the ingredients, especially the vegetables are from her garden.After a full meal, we walked around bollywood veggies to view various species of spices and vegetables. A really well maintained place
3
I visited Poison Ivy after visiting Bollywood Veggies and was surprised by their menu - pretty unique. The dishes we ordered are fresh and even the fried ones taste delicious. The owner is very friendly and even told me what to look out in the farm. It is a good place for families
4
The vegetables and fruits are homegrown by the restaurant owner who owns a agricultural farm where the restaurant is located in. The dishes are prepared in Peranakan style and taste simple. But the flavours take you back to the 60s and 70s of Singapore. What is especially great are the desserts - the warm banana bread is heavenly. I visit the restaurant only once every 3 to 6 months because it is located on the outskirts of Singapore but the travel time spent is always worth it
4
Despite the distance, we decided to explore Bollywood Veggies and dine at Poison Ivy because we heard great things about this place. Bollywood veggies is a farm/garden and poison ivy is the name of the restaurant inside it, serving food made with the plants, vegs that are grown in the farm. It's Asian food like curries, nasi lemak etc. We had the small warrior platter (for 2) with brown rice and a plate of nasi lemak. Ordered the Aloa Vera drink and 2 lemongrass and had a slice of the freshly made banana cake. Absolutely delicious! Seriously! If I hadn't have diabetics, I would have more! Total cost is $43 for 3 person. Highly recommend for anyone to come (even vegetarians). There is a shuttle bus service (if you don't drive) that brings you to the door step from Kranji MRT.

This was my second visit, the staff named Irene still remember us!! She is very lovely, every time came to my table talk to us and sure make a lot of fun with us and share her story. She is very skinny with short hair look very fierce when first time we saw her,but actually she is a fun and cheerful and sweet lady!!! Very touch that she remember us and my knee injured.I'll strongly recommend Poison Ivy not just the staffs are friendly and the food are really delicious!!! The Nasi Lemak and the worrier plate is a must try
5
I had something to eat here after my tour round Bollywood Veggies.I was greated by a friendly female member of staff.I ordered the scrambled eggs and toast ($5). The food was good and not expensive.I noticed they also do vegetarian food, lunch and dinner ( they do close at 6pm).They also serve beer and wine.I recommend coming here. I will definitely return
4
Quite out of the way if you don't drive. But it's a trip worth it. Had lunch ordered nasi lemak platter with side quail eggs sambal for 3 of us. Ok as we are not big eaters. Nice refreshing unsweetened lemongrass & a little sweeten aloe cold drinks. Not pricey. Had a quiet stroll in the garden after lunch. Great for families with kids. Place like back to nature.
4
We went on a busy Sunday afternoon about 1230pm by which time the breakfast had finished; however we had the Nasi Lemak and the Vegetarian platter, plus a side of Chicken Curry and Jack Fruit Rendang. The food is decent; and not hugely over priced. The place was packed and had a very nice vibe, lots of families and the staff was very friendly. We even met the owner! Out the back they have a farm (of sorts) which makes for a nice stroll around. Certainly something very different for a Sunday afternoon in Singapore!
3
It's started so well, a lovely sunny day and we were pleased to arrive for a yummy lunch. The platter was great and we enjoyed the blend of favors and tastesThe only downside was when the brownie arrived it was microwaved and stodgy. For a place with the slogan of "life is beautiful, eat well", I can't see the need to microwave food. It's proven to be unhealthy and a major detractor
4
An eatery located next to the farmland in the northern part of Singapore, where fresh ingredients are used to prepare local dishes. Spend your Sunday away from the bustling city at the farmers' market shopping for local produce, and enjoy a slow lunch thereafter.
4
You can just let your kids play around while having your food. The ambience is great. They use the organic produce from their bollywood veggies to prepare food. Some of the gravy dishes we ordered didn't have salt in it and very very less spicy. Since we like spicy food, we didn't like it that much. The fried dishes were good.You need to pay cash here

We set off in the AM to see the Jurong frog farm. We took a taxi from our place near West Coast Park. In retrospect, we could have taken the MRT to Kranji then the Kranji Express Bus.... In fact, it is the same bus that took us eventually to the Bollywood Veggie spot. This place is the opposite of most things in Singapore, and we really enjoyed it. The food here was quite good and the service was outstanding. The prices are also quite low for Singapore food served in an air conditioned room (with large glass windows to see into the gardens). You also can eat outside if that is your preference. We had the Warrior Platter and an Eggplant Omelette, both were very nice. The kids had fish & chips, were also were well done and delicious. We were very happy, but, when it was time to go, we had to wait about an hour for the bus. We just wanted a taxi, but none could be had. It is too remote, so changes are high noone will come and get you. If I had a car, I would absolutely come back again and again, but at the mercy of the bus and taxi system, I probably will not make it back anytime soon.... plan your trip accordingly and watch the bus schedule carefully..

If you're in the area its a nice place to have a lunch. I wouldn't drive any great distance for a meal here, it was clean, nice seating, friendly staff and fast sevice. They have a nice menu with a wide list of foods to choose from. Price was reasonable and we would return, if in the area
3
The whole concept of farm bistro is fun and well organized but frankly the food was just average, not so tasty for fresh organic products and a lot of deep fried cuisine which in my opinion kills a lot of taste.Good to go for a walk in the gardens, ok for lunch but don't expect much
3
Took a while to find this place with my gps. Tucked in the middle of one of few remaining farmland here. The setting is laid back and serene. Good for a relaxing time with family or friends, if you don't mind the drive here and back. The food is well cooked but a little too light for my taste. Portion is small as well, and I had to go for another meal somewhere else after this. There's a note saying you could order more salt in your food by telling you need more poison. Maybe that's what I need. At least the place is air-conditioned. Having said this, my family enjoyed the meal. Or we're they too hungry from searching for this place?After your meal, there's a really small garden where you can have a quick walk to complete the farm-ish experience
1
Ordered specials of the day, recommended by the staff.Unfortunately, the rice and other dishes were served cold.When highlighted, a curry and bean curd were re-heated. The rest of the dishes weren't changed.Took another 10 minutes for the curry and bean curd to be brought back, at lukewarm temperature! Not surprisingly, I didn't bother to finish my meal, paid the $28, and left. Proceeded to the Rail Mall at Bukit Timah, where we had a much more pleasant meal, at a fraction of the price earlier paid at Ivy's
5
Brought my kids to visit Bollywood Veggies. It was hot and soon the kids were complaining, so we went into the cool Poison Ivy for a cool drink.Saw the menu and decided to have lunch there as well although it was only 11am. Ordered the pasta for the kids and my wife and I ordered the Warrior Package for 2 pax. We were pleasantly surprised when the food arrived in a basket tray. In it were fried leaves (not sure if it is sweet potato leaves), curry chicken, a spiced potato dish, quail eggs, fish w/ ar cha, tofu w/ mushroom etc.It was quite a complete meal that was very flavoursome. The spices used were nice! Needless to say, I eat it all up. The service was very friendly and thoughful. Ambiance was peaceful and relaxing. Two thumbs up. I will come for the food alone. Worth the drive there

Poison Ivy is the signature bistro of Ivy Singh Lim who owns Bollywood Veggies - a sustainable farm project in the Kranji Community area in the North of Singapore IslandWhile the bistro offers such up market meals as roasted quail, alongside traditional asian staples,Ivy's farm is a powerful demonstration that putting back is as important as taking. But she also suports the local farmers, purchasing additional supplies for the restaurant, and provides employment and support for those less less fortunate who need a second chance in life.Loved and feared in equal amounts by all, Ivy is as energetic as she is eccentric and it is a treat to meet her and share her pride in her achievements.Easy to find with the "Wild West" tourist ma

Poison ivy is a great place for a weekend lunch. Wonderful food and great service. Arrive a bit early to beat the rush. We had nasi lemak, chicken curry, beet root salad, tofu with eggplant in coconut milk, brown rice, and sago desert. Adults and children will enjoy the walk through the garden after lunch. Buy some banana bread to take away.
5
Lovely place in Singapore's countryside.
Food is basic but absolutely delicious and reasonably priced.
Try the banana curry
5
Enjoyed eating in this basic restaurant. The food was fresh and the vegetables were grown in their gardens. The staff were friendly and helpful. Well worth eating here.
4
From start to finish, it had been a lovely experience. The walk around the farm & then the little restaurant/cafe right in the midst of greenery is really an experience to behold.
Food was fresh & I savoured every bite.

Poison Ivy restaurant is an organic restaurant situated within Bollywood Farm at Neo Tiew Road, one of the most rural road you can get in the urban Singapore. Due to the remote location of Poison Ivy, it is visited mainly by the local population as a short weekend getaway. For those of you who are visiting Singapore, it is still a restaurant worth going for those of you who 1) Comes in group of 4-5 people 2) Has more than 3 days in Singapore. While the taxi fare on a standard taxi is around 25 dollars during weekday lunchtime from Raffles City + it is a half an hour drive, the restaurant's quality and budget friendliness actually evens out the cost - or even make it cheaper - than eating in a urban restaurant as the menu's price is so budget friendly. Plus, you get locally grown fresh & lovingly cooked organic food with an unforgettable flavour.Although banana cake is known as the must try by local Singaporeans, I personally find everything else in the restaurant so authentically GOOD that banana cake , while still really good, fades into the background & become optional. There is not a single thing in the menu I won't recommend. (& Yes, I have tried almost everything).The owner's, Ivy Singh, also makes the restaurant SHINES. I will not be a spoiler & let you find out for yourself. Although the restaurant is call Poison Ivy, I think it shall be renamed "Sassy Ivy" or "Lovely Ivy". Ivy is one of the nicest lady you can talk to. You just visit once, and she will probably remember you for the rest of your life & even remember the last conversation - even though you may not visit for MONTHS. Plus, she is also an important witness of Singapore's earlier history, too. For those of you who wish to know Singapore better, Ivy herself is another good reason why this restaurant should be on your list for your next visit

I just love the ambience and the food here.Cant remember how many times I come here, the moringer tempura is a must! Always ordered different types of food when I come here and it never failed me. If its too complicated, just order the warrior platter. You wont know what are they going to give you. And it never failed me!Only setback here , you need to drive or over the weekend need to get the shuttle service there
4
Went here for breakfast and it was so good (and cheap) that I had lunch as well! This place has atmosphere - there is so much to look at, read and take in. Homegrown produce is what you eat (Bollywood Vegies) and very tasty. I recommend the banana curry! Service is friendly and attentive. Make sure you pay a visit to the toilet

This must be one of the very last undeveloped parts if Singapore. It's food quality is perfection and local in every sense of the word. What makes this little gem so good is its family feel, it's generosity in every sense and the quality of its produce. Don't go expecting anything sophisticated. Sophisticated it is not but genuine home produced fare with an excellent price tag it is. Plastic plates maybe and cafe style tables and chairs just make thus the honest little diner that it is and one wonders how they can make it pay. It's associated with a superbly presented botanical farm and if you are really lucky you may find the resident Professor (retired nowadays) to help you to understand everything you might ever have asked yourself about specific plants and trees, what can be eaten and what must never be tasted. Poison Ivy makes a pint if no salt or MSG and tells you that if you want the poison you can ask for it to add to,your meal but never used in cooking. Just fabulous, just so local and basic.

Bollywood Veggies Poison Ivy restaurant makes for a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. The restaurant is set amongst a large amount of green land and you instantly feel relaxed here. We sat outside and had the chicken curry which was delicious, banana curry which was a bit tasteless and farm salad which was really flavoursome and fresh. Dessert was banana bread - warm and yummy!Definitely recommend this place
5
After I rode past the Bollywood Veggies places from owner Ivy, I was told by one of my buddies that their restaurant Poison Ivy is great home grown food.The next day (Sunday 26 May) I was back and was definitely not disappointed !We loved the ambiance (think hippi ish) the food (fresh, flavoursome) and the value (40$ for a 2 people lunch).I would recommend the chicken curry. I would also recommend the cheap papaya salad ($4) , its not a thai variety, its different but fresh and nice. The banana bread is fantastic, I brought a piece home for tea later. The kan kong veg tasted superb. The only dish that was not SUPER, but def still nice was the fish (a bit dry).I love how the owner (who lives in next door villa, with a Jag in front of the door so I don't think she is much of a hippy) meanders around. She seems very nice, especially because she makes a point of giving all kinds of people a chance of employment that would probably not get one elsewhere.My only disappointment is that they are not open for dinner (yet). I can picture candles, oil lamps,etc in that green environment as super nice for chill evening dinners.If you have kids I can imagine that they would love to come here and wander in the 'garden' or production plots (all lovingly tagged with what you are looking at) so go and have a look/bite

I have been stopping here regularly for lunch, on a round the island weekend cycle ride. The history and environment of Bollywood Veggies is fascinating, and I never tire of wandering round the garden to see how many variety of bananas are growing. Poison Ivy restaurant is basic, but the food is amazing. I like the Banana curry with brown rice. At weekends the restaurant is full of families with young children plus the occasional coach tour. The staff are very attentive and if you're lucky, you get to meet and talk with Ivy, the owner, who is definitely a legend in her own lifetime! This is a part of Singapore unlike any other - and let's hope it stays so
