2nd visit to the restaurant. Place dated in deco. Thai chef and servers. Ordered salted egg pumpkin, yu Sheng, Tom yam seafood soup, fried spicy fish, sambal Kang Kong and desserts. All good. Went on a weekday dinner, place not crowded.

Its probably the best Tom Yum soup I had in Singapore. Lemongrass drink is refreshing and priced at $1 only. It's pretty crowded but we received our food in less than 15 minutes which was reasonable.

Yes!! If you're looking for thai food, this is good.. Golden Mile complex, a bit far from mrt st, but good for taste..

this is a favourite fallback of mine when i want a taste of thai food but can't fly off for a food safari. as far as i can tell, this place serves authentic thai fare and the place is run by thais. locals, thai workers and tourists come here and are welcomed. the fried pork skin comes with fried basil, unlike some mass produced stuff from some other outlets in the building. tried steamed fish here on an earlier visit with a friend and it was good

I came here for lunch last week with a friend. The restaurant itself has an unpleasant mouldy smell inside. Good selection of Thai food at reasonable prices. We opted for the Pad Thai, a Mango Salad and some fish and supplemented with milk tea. The food wasn't anything special though and the Pad Thai was way too oily. Don't think I'll be back

If you are looking for authentic Thai food at reasonable prices, Golden Mile is the place to be. There are a number of cafes here, some have been operating for more than 20 years. We chose Beer Thai after reading several reviews.The food here is delicious and authentic - though it's not as good as what you will get in Thailand proper. The prices are very reasonable in pricy Singapore. The place was heaving when we got there at about 630 pm and continues to do a brisk trade throughout our meal.The Thai ladies that make up the service staff were friendly and warm. Service is efficient. Our meal of pad Thai, red curry chicken, tom yum seafood soup and deep fried fish with mango salad were all good. The only downside is that the food is somewhat msg laden so do watch out if you are sensitive to this. Also for those unfamiliar with Golden Mile, the mall is quite run down and as are most of the establishments here

As a local Singaporean, this place is a good find for me too! If you are looking for a place with authentic Thai food and ambience. I would say this place is like "Little Thailand" in Singapore. The dishes there starts from about $8. I would recommend the roasted pork! Price: About $25/pa

Beer Thai food privong is a reasonable and it is comparable.to those in Thailand. If you are not used to Thai food in Thailand, this is not the place. For.those who love Thai food in Thailand will love the food here in Beer Thai in golden mile complex

it's not high end polished restaurant and very much like all the joints in Golden Mile complex. nonetheless it's my third trial there and the best i had.good choice, nothing fancy. we did not sample the more elaborate and expensive seafood options but the basics are sound (papaya salad, tom yam, marinated pork, padang chicken). the pad thai were one notch down.less than 50bucks with beer and tea, it is a safe spot to come back if i am in the area

Tried this restaurant upon recommendation by a colleague who loves everything Thai. Their Thai milk tea has a good balance of tea flavor; we also tried their pork knuckle stew - v tender, omelette, duck noodle soup, fish maw soup and fried basil with minced pork. Total bill incl 3 drinks $46. None of the dish disappoints. I was especially happy to find Thai fish maw soup here as my fav stall in Soi 38 in Thonglor closed down. At $6 a big bowl, you can add bee Hoon at no cost and it can be a comforting meal on its own.Place was crowded on Sat night that we were here. There was a Q for tables but service was fast and you won't have to wait v long
