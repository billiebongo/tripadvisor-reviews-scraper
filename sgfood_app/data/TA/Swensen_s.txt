After a long walk to see the numerous sights in Singapore, this is a perfect place to replenish your energy. The viands they offer are yummy and inexpensive. Considerably popular and stomach filling yummies

Poorest quality food ever, being European I can say this food is typical American: bad, unhealthy and extremely poor quality and not fresh, moreover it tastes like reheated food made in factory

Ordered Fish and chips, seafood pasta, chicken wings, cesar salad and a topless ice cream for 3 of us.
Found the portion pretty small if u are hungry.
Paid total $85 for our meal including 2 drinks.
Think the portion had reduced over the years.

Found this place by accident. The sundae's are huge and could defiantly share. We also ordered Fries which were nice and hot and fresh. Lots of different choices of ice cream treats. I ordered an ice coffee which was a HUGE disappointment. Just coffee with ice blocks in it. My kids loved it but both could not finish their sundae's. The seating was close together and you could hear everyone's conversations

It's in the city walk mall, does not have many tables but offers a memorable experience.The staff, to begin with, was really amazing. Great service, and hospitality. And food really takes the cake.My kids declared their Mac and Cheese as the best ever.The dessert selection too, happens to be impressive. Would recommend the place any day

I never did like lamb chop. But decided to try at this Swensen's. First, I was not asked how O wanted the meat done. It came well done. Nearly 70% of the chop is fats! I finished the meal so fast that my wife asked me to order another meal. The meat was so dry! Wanted to ask the waitress about the way they take orders for meat dishes... but my wife stopped me... Pointless I guess. I also had malted milk shake. Tasteless... couldn't even taste the sticky chewy ice cream. Such a disappointment

Went to the mall and looked for a place to get simple food that could be digested easily. That ruled out all the Chinese and Thai food at the Food Republic at the fourth storey. we found the Svensons place a floor below. I ordered the mushroom soup in sourdough bread and a berry shake. My friend ordered the humongous banana split. The sourdough bread was shaped like to coconut and had the soup inside- like the classic stuff you get at Pier 21 in San Francisco. Very good taste, fresh, decent portion. The Shake was also good. My friend enjoyed the banana split very much. We could sit & talk with no disturbance. staff was friendly. Pricing was good too. All told, a good experience

Celebrated this year's Mother's day at Swensen City square. After a late night movie, tasty meal at this friendly western restaurant was a wonderful experience. The mushroom soup that was ordered wrongly by us was immediately replaced. The staff was very friendly and supportive as we finished our meal beyond their closing time. They all waited for us a withe a beaming smile as we ended our meal with a super-yummy banana split ice-cream. recommended order- fried, mushrooms, chicken baked rice, mushroom soup and banana split ice cream

We came here on Saturday morning for breakfast as they open at 8 am unlike the weekdays when it's at 10 am or even later. There was plenty of options to choose from, we had the egg omelette which came with mushrooms and 2 little butter buns (they called those ciabatta buns but they look or taste nothing like ciabatta) and two sausages with a hash brown. We enjoyed the food and will be back to try something for lunch or dinner
