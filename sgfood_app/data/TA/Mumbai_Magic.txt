We had dinner here. Not bad, one can try here. It is a very small place but the owner there was very courteous and helpful. They served good food and took good care of us.
5
We had a gujarati thali for about $8 per head. And it was the beat food we have had in ages. The staff and owner was very friendly and pleasant. Service was excellent. Will recommend everyone to try this if you like veg food

They provide u with jain gujarati thali n that too unlimited... On spl request they can provide pure jain food... V really love d pure jain gujarati food... Definitely v vl visit again

The buffet thali is really good... One of the best places to get Indian food at Singapore. They offer a la carte as well as thali options - Gujarat Thali, Rajasthani Thali, Punjabi Thali etc. You can go for thali to have a sumptuous meal

If you are in singapore go to mumbai magic restaurant for indian veg food .awesome food in little india.

This is very simple restaurant serves very homely style vegetarian food. Very much economical... please show generosity to tip the staff! Many of items are worth to try and I recommend Punjabi Thail.
5
Cooked well and if you are looking for Gujarati food with north indian flavour this is a must. After a long time if you are an Indian from Gujarat or Rajasthan you will like the cuisine. $8 is a fairly decent charge in the most competitive restaurant around you.

Not a great place at all, facility does not have a room to handle a group buffet lunch/dinner and holding bigger group reservations. Set up buffet bar in one little corner, where only one person can go to get the meals. People were crowed up and making other peoples cloths dirty with oils stains. Food taste was not great and management didn't care to listen to the customer.The washroom was just the joke, it was all filthy, lots of mold every where and damaged walls, No soap or the paper towel in the washroom

Went here on a recent visit to Singapore, highly recommended. Great food and great service.My daughter is in a wheelchair and the staff were very accommodating moving some chairs for us.A small restaurant hid among many on racecourse road, but definitely worth seeking out

To have one of the finest indian authentic taste of north Indian dishes... exactly how they prepare in the North Indian homes.. fresh, richness in aroma, authentic cuisine for Rajasthani, Gujarati, Punjabi and many other Buffet or Thali in platters lovely food.

Good place located at Little India. Provides different thali at descet prices. Ate Rajasthani and Gujarati Thalis. Uncle sitting at the cash counter is quite helpful.

I enjoy Gujarati, Punjabi, Rajasthani thali here...The owners and people serving are courteous and pricing is modest.

Indians aren't treated with respect.
No proper food, limited varieties,
Not clean,no space
Would choose to stay hungry rather than going to this.

This is the best place in whole of Singapore to eat the perfect Indian food. Offers different thalis at a very reasonable price. The best part is Jain food is available. Thalis - Punjabi, Jain, Gujrati, Rajasthani & Maharashtrian! The price is just 7$ and trust me its simply value for money. Besides they offer chaat, chinese, tandoor, pizzas and sandwiches! My favourite place so much so that we try to visit this place once every fortnight atleast!!

The first thing that I remember entering thia place was the smell.Maybe the Aircon was turned off or not working either ways it smelt of a musty stale kitchen. The hand wash area was so dirty that it made me shudder to imagine the standard of cleanliness that this restaurant maintained. The place looked like it was over staffed with the staff lounging about everywhere . It was so very unprofessional. The food was decent and hot though.But if you like clean and not restaurants that smell like an old kitchen I would give this place a miss

This place is just five minutes walk from Little India station.The food is great and the price is nominal.There are different types of limited thali meals available which are priced at $ 7 and Mumbai magic the unlimited thali at $ 12. The taste of all the items are good. Try this place if you are visiting Singapore you won't regret eating here

Hi,I had been to this place once couple of days back for dinner. They have different thalis (Gujarati, Punjabi, Maharashtrian etc.) Food tastes good and the restaurant staff is polite... Their food tastes more like a home made food. Also they have good chaat options so if you are missing home made Indian food or indian chaats try this place once.Regards,Prakash Matuwan

Let's be clear - what this place is good for and what it can improve in...The unlimited thali is very good and cheaply priced. - 14-15 different items (unlimited) for 12 sgd is a very reasonable price. The variety and taste was fairly good as well - we loved it.We separately ordered samosa and couple of other items. The samosa were cold at the center and thus probably frozen and refried - when we bought this to their notice , they replaced them with properly cooked ones.Would revisit if I crave a thali

we were craving for indian food , and Mumbai magic was a complete saviour for us. It was a small restaurant, They serve north indian punjabi thali, Maharshtrian thali, jain thali, gujarati and Rajasthani. We ordered maharashtrian Thali. Food taste was good. Price was also reasonable. They served pao bhaji, Bhel etc in addition to normal thalis. overall good experience

This place can easily be avoided. If you care about your stomach- don't go. We all felt sick after eating here. The yoghurt that was a base for several dishes was sour and rancid.
3
Reasonably priced. Good Maharashtrian and Gujarati food - good Pav Bhaji and chaats. Thali is good. The servings are in good portions.
4
Food mildly spicy, closer to home foodRotis one of the best I have had in SingaporeThey have an amazing array of Thalis : Maharashtria, Gujarati, Punjabi, Rajasthani and special thaliFood is worth the money, though you might find the quantity a little less if you are used to the usual Indian style thali, but nevertheless, it was enough for me.Every dish I had was really well prepared and served hot.Would surely recommend giving it a try

We were in Little India and decided to drop in to try our Mumbai Magic.We would not visit again.The service was prompt but the entire experience left a lot to be desired.For starters, the restaurant wasn't very clean. One of the waiters dropped a spoon and instead of taking it away to clean, he just put it back on another table.The glasses were dirty and none of us dared to drink any water out of them.We ordered a few things to see if the food had any magic.We tried out the Sev Puri, Papdi Chaat, Pav Bhaji, Maharashtrian Thali and Vada Pav (all typical Mumbai dishes).None of them were particularly good.We couldn't wait to finish and leave
5
I keep coming here when i yearn for homecooked meals...they have various types of thalis - gujarati, rajhasthani, marathi, etc and their thalis are very pocket friendly..the restaurant is owned by a gujarati family and the service is brilliant.. overall their food is one of the bes

We have been here now 2 times in the last 5 days and I believe it is apt to write a review. The place resonates the taste of Maharashtrian and Gujarati food to its authenticity. The different types of Thalis (complete meals) are well designed in quality and quantity. The signature dish, which is their Special Thali is too good to resist. It is a bit too much for the tummy but if you are having it once in a while, then I would suggest to close one eye and enjoy.The Misal Pav & Poha were just gulped down by the family. The Chaas (buttermilk) is very nice and refreshing with all the spices. All dishes are priced reasonable and the team serving the customers are very hospitable and courteous.Thumbs up to this place.

Set your expectations low when going into Mumbai Magic, then you could come out smiling. This all vegetarian place, does serve some authentic western India cuisine. But it is very evident that the management is pretty shabby. They have put very little thought into the ambiance and service that the overall experience can leave you a bit disappointed. With the food they serve, they do have great potential, especially in Little India. But, I am afraid that if they do not step up their game, we may not be able to savour those chats for very long!My take - if you are looking for chats/pav bhaji/Rajastani food, and not very particular about the service and ambiance - then Mumbai Magic can be a good option. Probably, I would head over to Kailash Parbat for similar cuisine, especially if I am dining with family

We went by for dinner on a Sunday evening, with minimal expectations and unfortunately realised that we should have set the bar even lower.To start with, the glasses and water jugs were oily and the water obviously tasted really bad. We were tempted to walk out but though we'd get by with bottled water, and persisted. We ordered a Dahi Bhalla (the Bhallas were rock hard, obviously not soaked in yogurt at all), a Roomali Roti (it was nothing like what it should be like - it was tiny and fit in my palm!), a Paneer Lajawab, which came recommended (we poured enough oil out of it to fit a shot glass), and a Hyderabadi Biryani (nothing like Biryani, was more like a pot of hurriedly thrown in ingredients).Despite the Paneer & Vegetables drowning in oil, that was probably the only palatable thing we had that evening. Mumbai Magic was worse than disappointing

We visited Mumbai Magic for lunch after my dad`s boss recommended it. Can`t say I was disappointed, but can`t say I was surprised either! (Maybe this is because I had no expectations about the place....) We ordered one plate of pav bhaji, which came with two small pieces of buttery pav and plenty of bhaji with an overwhelming amount of butter swimming on the top- the bhaji was definitely designed to make the luncher order more pav. I remember seeing a line of containers in the back of the restaurant outside the kitchen. I therefore assume that all the food was sadly pre-cooked. With all these woes, the one thing that stood out completely in an utterly amazing way was the chilly paneer. It was simply the best thing we had ordered, with the right je ne sais quoi flavour and portion size (enough for an entire family). The price was right too. In conclusion, if you are planning to visit this place, in my opinion the chilly paneer is a must have, with all other things worth a miss. However, there are many other better eateries in the area, so there is no real reason to visit this plac

I quite liked this place. We had one of their signature meals, which was made up of twelve or so little pots with lots of something I couldn't quite understand. Plenty of variety and curious flavours. The lunch filled me for the rest of the day. And it is inexpensive
