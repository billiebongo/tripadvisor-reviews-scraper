Texas chicken is really nice and juicy. Unless other fast food chicken which are mostly drier. One of the best fast food chicken available. Whip potato is also very fine and one of the best. üëç

If you are waiting for the show to start and have no mych time, it would be the best option. Quality was good, with good price. Fast service and friendly staff.

Try Texas Chicken meals with biscuits. Truly tender inside and crispy outside. Deliciously yummy to the bones!

This Chicken is very good! I am from Louisiana and we eat it all the time. On Mondays at Vivo city they offer 6 chicken tenders for $6.00

Being used to having very small servings of chicken with the likes of KFC we ordered accordingly and boy were we in for a shock. What we ordered could have feed four people. The chicken pieces were large moist and really nice.everything that we received was large. I only wish the other chicken shops could serve the same as this one did. Do try it out you won√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be disappointed

This place is in the Supertree dining area at Gardens by the Bay, just outside the Supertree Grove. It is in a large food court with about 6 restaurants that share loosely eating areas. I used the test of which place had the biggest crowd and hit me with some good creature comfort food after a long vibrant day of touring the Gardens and trees. I found the chicken very Americanized which was perfect for me. Much better than KFC for sure. I had spicy chicken, like Popeyes in the States, which was great. There was a hotter choice with chili powder that I passed on. Decent biscuits also.Quick friendly service. Chicken and sides done right, for about $6 USD. Hard to beat in touristy expensive Singapore, especially at the Gardens by the Bay. A nice successful delicious choice before or after the Tree light show or during a visit to that part of the Gardens

We looked at the queue to get back on the MRT (train) and decided to go back and check out the dinner options.There were a few people milling about but the Texas Chicken seemed like a good option for our 14 year old and we went with it.From the moment we walked in the door the manager guy started yelling at us that there were no wraps or burgers available . . . I guess we'll have something else? We managed to place our order with the poor girl behind the counter despite the manager who continued to shout instructions to rest of the customers after us (maybe 20? or so). No one was getting burgers or wraps that's for sure. I had to repeat a number of things on my order because the poor girl taking the order couldn't hear me over the shouting manager. (I get it - no wraps of burgers!)After all that the order was actually not too bad. The chicken was cooked well and although very bland it wasn't bad for food of this type. The place was busy and it's difficult to understand why the wraps and burgers were such an issue. The manager really needed to stop shouting this at every person who walked in. As we left there were still people receiving their orders so clearly there was still some cooking happening. Manager here needs to get some clues about customer service. Girl on the counter was really good. Date of review - Friday 4th August time - 9:10p

After wandering around the foody areas and not able to get consensus of what to eat for lunch we decided to try Texas Chicken We all ordered the 2 piece meal with mashed potato, gravy and cold slaw, the chicken was cooked to perfection crispy on the outside tender and juicy on the inside, everyone wished they ordered the large mashed potatoes.Our review YU

We had just spent the entire day sightseeing and had only stopped once for a single scoop of gelato so by the time we had finished with everything in the gardens we were very hungry. We followed the signs to the Supertree Dining area and found Texas Chicken at the far right end of the facilities.I ordered the Tex-Wrap Combo and up-sized it for $1.00 more, the combo includes fries and a drink. My friend ordered Combo B which is a three piece chicken combo that came with mashed potatoes.This was some good chicken, much better than KFC which I have stopped going to. The fries were good but the chicken was the best. My friend enjoyed her chicken and gave it a 4 out of 5, this was my assessment as well.Service was a little slow but I don't mind a little slow when the food is good, and this food was good

This was my first visit to Texas chicken restaurant. The restaurant is located facing the artificial trees and Marnia sands building. The portion of the chicken is large and best of all is finger licking good. The price of the food is a bit pricy I will say. Waiter and waitress are friendly and they provide a good service.
3
The place was clean and the food is your standard takeaway chicken. Nothing special here, only the kids will be happy.
5
Visit Texas Chicken at Sentosa Resort in Singapore. You will love the unique taste and hospital there. Cheers.
4
We were surprised at how good the chicken was and how varied the menu was, as well. For fast food, a great choice!
3
We went there mainly because of the kids as they wanted to have burgers and chicken. Honestly the food is typical and ok. But on that day i felt chicken was not properly fried and taste was just ok.
4
Would really love their Herb and Garlic flavour to be reintroduced again as soon as possible if can be done
4
This is a fast food clone of the Colonels famous chicken without the 11 herbs and spices. The Texas chicken has generous portions and the meat was succulent. The mashed potatoes and gravy rivals the original for quality. Very satisfied with quality of the meal
4
Good chicken - Spicy one is the best. Texas chicken is always one of the best chicken chains. they good variety of choice from tender, leg piece, biscuit etc.
3
Hi all, we went there with family and kids. they serve typical burgers and fried chicken. overall its a good place to hangout and try some when your crave for chicken. However the quality sometimes differ, didn't enjoyed on that particular day. Fish burger was also just ok no difference to other places
2
Probably due to the lack of customers at this outlet, it seems like they deployed the slowest staff here. The food was average and not freshly cooked. You'd find better food at the nearby "Satay by the bay", or going back to the city centre (Marina bay, Esplanade)
5
In terms of food, one can't expect much on the taste or presentation, basically fast food standard is there. However, staff here are friendly, that give this place an extra point. Especially after walking around the garden in humid weather, this is a nice place to take a break and cool down
5
Will definitely comeback here. Delicious and satisfying taste. Please build a branch here in the Philippines!

dry, overcooked chicken and very unappetizing. Threw it in the bin. Others seemed to like it but considering how well other outlets do their chicken I was surprised
3
Found this to be nothing special, a little to spicy Average food with average service. The staff were not very helpful at all , after asking to make sure our food would not be hot,it was.

Texas Chicken lacks the taste, quality and service that many other similar chains can offer, such as KFC or Popeys. I bought from the Star Vista branch. They have a new flavour now, Tom Yum, maybe I give it another try.
4
Chicken is good.. different taste from other chicken resto. But unfortunately you cannot have your favorite chicken parts all in one order. You need to wait for atleast 30 mins if you are willing to wait. But over all its recommended for chicken lover.
5
The fast food is not crowded. After walking around the garden, stop by to eat the crispy chicken. Affordable chickens
4
Very affordable and good Texas style deli,,,value for money,,,fast service,,can eat in or take out and watch the sound and light show at th SuperTrees,,,

Back in Australia i really enjoy KFC so i knew i would like this place. I was delighted to see such a big rage of choices on the menu and the prices were reasonable. The lady who served me wasn't very friendy to me but was to other customers which was disappointing.I had a chicken wrap meal and it was delicious. Ill never be impressed with kfc after eating here. The quality is wonderful. The honey biscuits were a real treat. The view is amazing as its located in Gardens By the bay. Its halal certified too √¢Àú
2
The eateries at Garden Bay were very limited & only Texas have Halal cert. The person who took my order speak English with thick Chinese accent which was hard to understand. I never tried Texas before but the biscuits was very nice and i did bought it again the very next day

Now of course, no fried chicken is healthy but it was good, crispy and not too oily for deep fried. Much better than some Korean fried chicken I had recently (Naruone, Sydney). We shared a 2 piece combo set when we were visiting the Gardens by the Bay during Christmas, so it was very busy. But the service staff were polite, helpful and quick to serve. The gentleman who was cleaning tables also helped us find a seat in a packed area. So overall a good experience!I would come again

basically it is an Asian version of KFC, lots of grease, not healthy eating but convenience if that is what you want, the kids liked the nuggets and chips.
1
First choice would be Popeyes, then KFC then maybe Texas or perhaps just go without. It's not worth the fat.
4
Food was hot, tasty and inexpensive. Loved the peach iced tea and the biscuits. Not sure why Texas would be known for chicken, but hey.... who am I?
4
Quick and convenient. Stall is in the basement of Vivo City just after entering after MRT. Good portion of meat and salad in a nice soft bread roll.
3
nothing special here, just plain chicken fast food, some of their chicken are dry, some are juicy, the only thing i like here is their mashed potato.
3
Pretty ordinary fried chicken and not at all healthy. A poor cousin to 4 Fingers. I opted for 2 pieces of fried chicken as a combo, served with some not very pleasant mashed potato and a soft drink for about $9. Ok but probably won't be back in a hurry. Visited the outlet at Expo

Had lunch here. Just love the way the chicken is done. It is PERFECT! It is crispy on the outside and juicy and tender inside. The whipped potato is also very delicious plus the biscuit. Felt very full after a two-piece original set. Great for family or friends gathering

Had dinner at Texas Chicken after visiting the domes on 19/2/15 (1st day of CNY). One of the few restaurants that is opened.Most tables were occupied and empty tables were not cleaned (diners did not clear the table after themselves or not enough employees working on CNY?). We had to clear the table before we could sit down as it was really messy.We ordered the original (or non-spicy) as we had children amongst us. Chicken is rather soft and tender. Even when we were given the chicken wing pieces, the drumlets were big (much bigger than the K-competitor). However, the butter biscuits lose out to the P-compeitior.We ordered three 2 pcs meal. Price worked out to be about $24; seemed to cost more than K-competitor. Perhaps more value for money if we had ordered two 3 pcs meal with upsize (I think about $2 cheaper) but their upsized fries and drinks looked much much bigger

In Singapore Changi Airport, I was waiting for my next flight to Indonesia. Since morning almost no food & I was very hungry, however my habit of Value Buying did not allow me jump the gun immediately (which happens all the time with me, whether looking for tiny or a M E G A buy).Texas Chicken was a good choice. Freshness, Quality & Quantity all together in a combo worth S$ 10.40; trust me, I could not finish that meal.It was really good option inside the Airport.Incase you are left with few hours inside an Aiport and looking for good meal at a reasonable price, Texas Chicken could be a good option to explore (provided you find one in the Airport you are stuck :-)).Cheers / Raja

Tried the Westgate branch of this fast-food chain.The fried chicken was disappointing - ordered the spicy version, but it was spicy..at all.The star of the meal was the Honey Butter Biscuits - super buttery and tasty!Overall, my personal opinion is that there are other fast food chains (eg. popeye's) that serve tastier fried chicken, probability of a return visit for me is not high
