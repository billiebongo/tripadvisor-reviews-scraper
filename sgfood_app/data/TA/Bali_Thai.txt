One of my favorite halal SE Asia restaurant in Singapore. Food is good, they offer Indonesia Bali abd Thai food and halal certified. Price is reasonable.

Very average food in a good but uninspiring location with friendly but slow service and poor value. Weak

Visited early evening so not busy. Once seated we placed order for entrees and main. One main arrived and no entree. Asked for entree and it arrived but wive was still waiting on main. While meal was nice the service was poor
1
We ordered honey chicken which was far too sweet and the basil chicken was so spicy that we couldn't eat it. On top of all that, the food is too expensive. We paid $107 for 4 people!!!! Eat somewhere else

My husband and I wanted a quick meal before going to the cinema. No more than 5 tables were occupied.We waited 30 minutes for 1 serving of fried rice and one salad ?Staff are friendly but the service terrible, with two other tables complaining about their orders.Will I go back ? Probably not .

It's give a 3.5. mainly on service then secondly on food.I was the only one in restaurant at time for lunch. Took a bit to order my food. Then they finally served my spring rolls (6/order) that we're not even lukewarm warm, straight cold. Took awhile to flag someone down to get me a proper order redone. Then ordered Chicken Phad Thai for meal. Portion compared to other places is a bit small. The waiter dropped me food and left didn't ask of I wanted chop sticks or typical Thai condiments they have at Thai restaurants. Since everything just took so long I didn't even bother to ask. Food was "ok". Not much flavor to it. Not much chicken on plate either.Very disappointed really

We were shopping at SunTec Center, looking for lunch. Bali Thai is a huge open space on the ground level, we were looking for noodles. They have a ten page menu, with pictures and english subtext. Four of us got four different things and we shared. REcommend teh noodles, seafood, tom young sauce and the cold lime tea

This palace needs to.close down or get chefs that know what they are doing. Pad Thai is pretty hard to.mess up, my kids.could make it better. Four of us are there. All four meals were average to poor. All.fkur of us left vowing never to return. One of us was sick afterwards. I think it was bad chicken. Anyhow, save your money and taste buds and avoid this place which is accurate in one sense, it's neither Bali nor Thai.

We had two great meals here again on our last Singapore holiday.One meal cost us $36.95 (1 entrée and 2 mains).Second time the meal was $53.45 (2 entrées and 2 mains).This was great value and great food.We got offered Free cold water to drink and a plate of fried crackers with a choice of chilly sauces to try.This was nice to have a cold drink and something to nibble on whilst we waited for our ordered food to come out.We too did notice a few new male staff members working here this time that do need to improve on service with a smile

Have frequent this restaurant several time but mainly for business lunch. Food is average and service really need improvement. Can feel is understaff during full house.
3
Food was pretty good, but we didn't feel the warm Thai greeting we were used to, having just come from Phuket, Thailand.
4
Stopped by for lunch and was served promptly. Pad Thai, Chicken & Beef Satays very good and the lime tea coolers refreshing. Well priced and a nice place to sit for a while before hitting the stores again.

We visited Bali Thai for the second time and third time this year and the experience was mixed The separate vegetarian menu is an advantage - and it's good that they are willing to accommodate small changes. The Bangkok fried rice is worth a try and tofu with basil leaves is good as wellBut the soup second time was sour and bad. Pineapples were largely missing from pineapple rice. Staff and service was attentive and I like the way in which they keep the list of items ordered on your table and keep checking if you have been served. But they really need to get the ordering sequel correct - getting the rice before the soup ? Not exactly the correct sequence Hope they can get it together

There's Thai and there's Thai....I am afraid that this one is neither. It's quite difficult to stand out because there is a sameness about everything. There were a few service hiccups as well. It isn't high quality but then again, it doesn't pretend to be...it is just a very "run of the mill" Thai restaurant and what you would expect inside a mall....and it is over-priced for what it is and what it is trying to achieve...

We have been regular to bali thai Katong restaurant and have been happy with service. But suntec city outlet change that impression. We were served a dish 5x spice level clearly. When we complained: rather than apologizing, the waiter is happy for us to leave! Pathetic attitude
4
Ordered a few dishes and requested for a particular ingredient to not be added. The waiter added that to the order slip however the dish still appeared with it. After eating we realized it had the ingredient. Though the staff changed it, they weren't sorry about it nor compensated in any form. Anyway the food was quite tasty

Went to Bali Thai at Suntec City for dinner. Since its a weekend I have anticipated it will be a busy period and the food might arrived pretty slow compared to the rest of the days. But was amazed that it come around 10 to 15 min only. Prawn cakes tastes good and I absolutely love the tom yam soup. The servers were friendly and welcoming as well.They are always with a smile. I will definitely return to Suntec City branch again

Let me separate the service from the food.Service, as I am unfortunately getting used to in Singapore, is pathetic. It does not matter what restaurant you go to. You would be welcomed with rudeness as it comes pretty standard. I asked for Thai red curry with some cashews sprinkled, may be weird for folks, but that's how I like my curry. I was flatly denied. Numerous other Thai restaurants I visited happily do that for customers. Not this joint. So I ended up ordering a simple vegetable fried rice, which as expected is never much to write home about. All in all edible is all I can say.This restaurant needs to reassess their wait staff, if they want repeat customers. May be they don't care enough because they are in Suntec mall and visited by enough people anyway. But never a good way to treat customers.

This outlet is centrally located, at Suntec city. Food is generally nice bit service may be a bit slow. Price is reasonable too.

Bali Thai is one of the halaal restaurant in Singapore. Delicious food, good service and suitable for my children.
3
Came here for a team lunch today and opted for one of the set menus. Service was efficient and the food was decent enough although a little spicy for my liking. The dessert was good though. Probably won't be rushing back here.
2
I had the chicken XO chili egg noodle dish, and had some trouble finding the chicken. The flavour was good but it was quite oily. Service was fast and correct.
3
Very busy place. It took a while for us to get the menus. We had to attract the attention of our waitress who was more interested in talking to a male waiter than providing the service. Some of the food was ok, but not all. I would not go there again

After lemongrass closed down, we have been looking for a Thai restaurant, which is medium range pricing and has a vegetarian menu.... Think Bali Thai fits the bill.They have an elaborate Thai menu, the service is efficient , and the pricing reasonable. Taste wise, some of the dishes were excellent - while others can be better - but none fell into the bad/ below average category. The mixture of Thai and Indonesian cuisine also helps widen the items you can eat and that helps the variety.Worth a visit
5
We have eaten at another Bali Thai Restaurant before so we knew the food is great.And we were right the food is still great.What was different here is the staff actually came and took our order for us and this made things so much easier than Sentosa Island's Bali Thai.The female waitresses here were much more friendlier and asked us how our day went and really did care about what we had ordered and what else we should try
5
Its beautifully decorated and service is attentive. The best part, they have a separate veggie menu with loads of options! We love love the tempura, the fiery jungle noodles, the soothing kang kong chilli and the bangkok fried rice! And amazing value for money. Portions are larg
5
Popped in for lunch and was stunned at the quality of the food. Got the flat noodles (Kwei Tyo) with basil Chili and seafood and was one of the tastiest dishes I have every ordered. Service was a little slow but understandable given that it was a little busy. Overall it was the best money we've spent in Singapore
3
Overall the dish size is a bit mini to me. We had BBQ Chicken , Green Curry Beef, Tom Kah Pot and not until we were served with the Fried Kai Lan, it was just several thin branches of Kai Lan (kind of Chinese/Asian vegetables similar to the Chinese broccoli or kale). My first impression was feeling like a left over dish of other table ! Favour-wise, all are average
5
The best lunch I had in Singapore. It combined excellent food choices with extremely good prices. Proposed for big families or parties!!

Visited just before our night safari, fish cakes and eggs and satay had been cooked long before and were hard and cold. Rice not heated through properly. Service staff messing around behind the till looked unprofessional

The restaurant is clean the chairs are trendy and comfy. Tasty dishes, friendly and attentive service.

Good place for vegetarians to have a great sumptious meal. They have a seperate vegetarian menu and even ask if egg is ok in your food. Good value for money. Service is good. Friendly staff. Good for big groups too.

I was in Suntec City with two friends. We were small eater. This seems like a fusion of bali n thai cruisine and not authentic foods. We ordered seafood glass noodles, thai green curry and mango salad. We loved the glass noodles as it was delicious and non greasy. I m not a spicy eater and the dishes were not too spicy for me and my chilly lover friends loved the glass noodles too. The mango salad was just ok. Good environment to chat and the bill was less than $50. Good services too. If one really fancy Thai food and love it really spicy, may have to ask the chef to spice it up for u

This outlet of Bali Thai is located in crowded place in Suntec city. I visited the place during weekday with 3 other colleagues during lunch time. The place was crowded. They have a wide menu with Thai, Indonesian dishes along with some local favorites. There is complimentary crackers served which were quite good. They have a small booklet with all vegetarian menu. Along with Ala carte menu they also have some set combinations. All 4 of us tried different combinations. The quantity of food was good. The quality was also nice. The service was bit slow. Infact they did not get the tender coconut which I had ordered as one of the drink. I tried the brown thai fried rice. In the dessert ai tried tapioca with cream. As compared to other places where I have tried tapioca this was too sweet. The sugar syrup was bit too much. Overall I liked the food and would like to visit the place again with family. Personally I would like to see a bit of improvement in their service level.

.....then they would easily have got a better rating. Restaurants have to score well in all 3 areas, environment, service and food. Although this is a smart clean looking restaurant and the food is actually very tasty (good level of spiciness) they totally failed on service. My food arrived and the green curry was in a hot bowl but I felt it was just a little bit too cool, so sent it back to get it hotter. It came back within 5 minutes, pipping hot and very tasty but my partners food had still not arrived. I started to eat mine expecting the other food to arrive - ten minutes later..still no meal. We caught the attention of a waitress and asked where it was - she disappeared and about 3 minutes later the rest of the food turned up - I had nearly finished mine. This is unacceptable - if 2 people go to lunch then they expect to eat together not one after the other. Maybe we were just unlucky, but will not be going back to find out as there are plenty of other good restaurants in Singapore

Bali Thai, a place you can have excellent Thai food away from Thailand. I always love having the green chicken curry with rice and glass of coconut water. Pineapple rice has also been one of my favorites here. The wait is staff is good and prices are reasonable as well. Enjoy

The expectations were not high from this restaurant, but when you are served stale food it leaves a bad taste in your mouth literally. Let me start with the honey chicken dish, the poached egg that was served was cold as if taken out of a freezer. The chicken tasted old as if it was refrigerated and then warmed to serve. The pineapple rice dish was also not fresh as it was clearly microwaved before serving. Even when we left the restaurant without finishing 10% of the dishes, no body bothered to ask how was the food. This is not at all a good Thai or fusion joint as it claims, foodies beware!!!!

Very nice having loved "British" Thai food for so long to try something a bit more authentic, we had a Tofu and Egg tower starter, BBQ Seafood, very nice Chicken wings.Mango Salad, Beef rendang curry was awsome and very similar to UK. Service was OK not great. Desserts were not my style but others in our group loved them (see Pic)Drinks menu was Alcohol free by the way, in case it matters
