The prata itself may not be the best. But what's a prata without the curry right? The combination of the curry and the sambal is fantastic. Really unique taste.

I work near the Tekka and for me Zul Prata is the best in singapore.Zul and his lovely Wife are always greeting the clients with a big smile which is already a bonus.The Prata is hand made from the dough to the flipping part.My Favourite is an egg and onion Prata and for my guests it's always murtabak- Prata stuffed with minced mutton.

This is the only stall in Tekka market that serves Prata (Roti Chenai) with the usual fish or dhal curry with added sambal. I also believe the only Malay stall prata. This couple is a good combination as the man makes the prata and the lady is the cashier and serves. The couple has been operating this stall for many years from Saturdays to Thursdays from 7am to 2pm. Fridays is their rest day. They also prepare murtabak. He normally prepares prata then and there. When in Tekka have a go at this stall

Roti Canai or if you prefer Prata, doused with fish curry and a spoonful of sinfully delicious Sambal at Prata Saga Sambal Bermuda. This cost no more than 80 cents and holy crap it was lovely. Thin, and middle crispy with little pockets of air the take in all that lovely curry

i have tried this prata at this stall managed by husband n wife team. The lady is very friendly and the prata master who is the husband and boss was an ex chef in a reputable hotel in singapore. His prata goes real well with the sambal ( chilli paste ) good fluffy prata with addicted sambal.
