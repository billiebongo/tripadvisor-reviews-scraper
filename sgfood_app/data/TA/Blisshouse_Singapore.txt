Really beautiful resto, ambience is just wow! It has a garden and flowery fragrance as well which is very fresh. A feeling like having some food in the garden. Ordered some drinks and truffle fries. The quantity is really good and quality was fine. Not wow but not bad either. I enjoyed my time there and experience. I would certainly go there again.

Went for my birthday celebration and we had our filings with satisfaction indeed! Love the button mushrooms and chilli crab pasta! And my all time favourite, caesar salad with garlic prawns!!! My children definitely love the cakes too for dessert. Creme brule, urgh..... delicious! A place that i will recommend to friends and relatives for any events or celebrations. Psssttt..... catered for wedding venue too! Go and check it out

The place is nice with great ambience but the food is not that nice. The mushroom soup was delicious but the baked rice could really do better... The tea was okay... I had the lemongrass and my friend had the Jasmine pot.. The calamari was a bit bland..

Stumbled across this place while walking in Central. The place has an excellent ambiance for couples, with a garden wedding theme setting and plenty of photo opportunities. The decorations are nicely done and comfortable. It's worth coming here just for the atmosphere alone. Food on the other hand is just like any cafe food
