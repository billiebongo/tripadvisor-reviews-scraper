We went there only once. We had seafood (5.50SGD) and chicken (5SGD) noodle: they were tasty but not our favorite in Singapore.

This food court is in City Square Mall and spreads on a whole floor. There are many cafes to choose from and they each have variety of meals to select from. I had (Roasted) Chicken Rice and Nanyong Laksa.
4
its open from 10 am to 10 pm. you can have your food before and after the movie. so its convenient. the food court is very neat and clean. and a few for deserts.

Quick service, something for everyone, clean and busy with lots of locals giving it their vote. Easy access up escalators in air con mall.

Whenever my family goes to the Food Republic foodcourt at City Square Mall, we would eat the Tonkotsu beef udon and the beef curry rice at the GOEN stall. Oh, so yummy! Like the ones we enjoyed so much in Osaka! :)

This food court is very busy for a reason you can get all kinds of food here and great Cos kids can eat something different if they want from parents but we loved the hainanese chicken rice (mixed plate) which contains roasted chicken and steamed chicken! Super tasty!

We went here a couple times. The first just looking and the second because we liked it.There is a wide range of food stalls selling chinese, Thai, Japanese and Singapore dishes freshly prepared when you order at reasonable prices.The tables are cleaned and maintained. It is well light. Women like it.Oh they have western utensils as well as Chinese

I used the one on Bencoolen Street many times. A delightful array of varied Singapore cuisines - Japanese, Chinese, Indian, Malay and Korean, and all very inexpensive. The Japanese area was my favourite, with smallish meals for $6-7. Service was very friendly and efficient. Numbered photos of the meals at the front counter remove any uncertainty of what you may be ordering. Very sophisticated. I will try the others on my next visit. A very happy, friendly environment. Strongly recommended

This eating place is pretty small, just a few food stalls, but it's located at the highest level, overlooking the mall if you sit at one connecting bridge. It's bright and spacious due to the high ceiling and skylight.Lunch time parking is free but from 1.30 pm to 2.The beef stall is good, and so is the stall selling on the spot fried hor fun or noodles

After shopping at city square & got hungry, where to eat within complex, Food Court "Republic". There're many outlets in Singapore I like this one because open space with high dome ceiling & bright atmosphere, clean as well. Well there are many other restaurants but let's leave them for later. I had Ban Mee w/ fried fish & my son had grilled fish For dessert pineapple & guava fresh cut fruit. Every thing was okay for quick bit.

Great idea - lots of different choices under one roof, all freshly cooked. we both chose our dinner from different providers, and both thoroughly enjoyed our food. Cheap too!

I had read some review which mentioned that food court has south indian food but it didnt. If you are a vegetarian dont waste your time going there. They only have non veg meals

Dropped in for dinner once. Interesting variety of cuisines and budget food. Decent seating area and choice of desserts as well.

this is a food joint with various offering. try fishes, pad thai, fried rice and hunan beef/ paper beef. the serving time is good. please take napkins as they do not provide.

I visited the food republic of City Square Mall gor several times as we stayed at Parkroyal on Kitchener Road, juz opposite of the mall! Their food was good but not awesome! I liked their Burger King mostly! They have few options in their menue!! Overall , it was good experience

My udon is just simply udon noodles drenched in Japanese curry sauce with a pathetic serving of potatoes. Not a single slice of carrot in sight! Was charged $4.90 for such a dish.Another pathetic dish is Ayam Penyet where the chicken serving is so minute that it looks like it's from a spring chicken. Definitely not enough to satisfy an average man's appetite

This place was so convenient for the hotel that I was staying in so I would cross over the road to buy some pastries for breakfast. The was an abundance of eateries from cafes and restaurants with local foods to the usual food chains love McDonald's and pizza parlours .The centre was a shoppers paradise from boutiques to department stores.There were also little places open to the forecourt to get A foot massage after hours shoppin

Like many other food courts in Singapore, It offers many similar cuisines like Chicken Rice, Roast Pork Rice, Japanese Bento or Ramen and drinks. Their price is also more costly as compared to those found in nearby Kopitiam. It's indoor and air conditioned so no need to worry if it's too hot or raining outside
5
Very nice ambience..reminiscent of the 1970s when food was sold outside the shophouses.The price is great, tourists and locals alike will love the decor and variety of food sold. Avoid the peak lunch period during business work days. Located on the highest level, the best seating is beside the glass wall - a good vantage point from where you can look out to the view
