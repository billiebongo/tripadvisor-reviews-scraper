perfect place to grab a light bite, a cake and a coffee. Friendly staff and a relaxed vibe to sit and read the paper or chat
5
Delicious pastries and good coffee provide a welcome break in the afternoon at this bakery located at Raffles.
5
This Raffles bakery is delicious. The cakes look beautiful and they taste equally as good. Try the scones if you can!
4
I love this little hide-away cafe because you can get a decent cup of coffee and croissant for under $10.00. You can read the paper and enjoy the ambiance and quietude. Since it is Raffles and they are now gearing up for the "Boatloads" of tourists, they get a bit sneaky with prices. Just go for the simple things and its good value for money. It used to be self - service, as most of these types of establishments are... rumour has it they are going to change that and also..raise the prices... Now where do I go for a cuppa

We visited here for lunch on a recent trip to Singapore. We spend $40 and I asked could I have another teabag as I like strong tea. I was told that I would have to pay another $7.50 for 1 teabag. The food here was very nice but we gave the place a miss after this very poor customer relations experience
4
This is the bakery that is a part of the Raffles hotel complex, so as you can probably expect their ability to be able to make coffee is going to be second to none (and with the prices that you would be paying to stay at Raffles for a night, I certainly wouldn't be expecting them to make really bad coffee). So, not surprisingly I decided to grab some, and not surprisingly it was actually pretty nice. We were even allowed to have it out in the courtyard (where I had had a Singapore Sling the last time I was here). Okay, it might not be Singapore's trendiest coffee shop, and probably not worth going out of your way just to have a coffee here, but it was pretty pretty nice, even though I'm not a big fan of Raffles itself
5
Visited this bakery with my wife and daughter, following a recommendation and had a very tasty lunch. Wide range of bread and fillings to choose from as well as their range of cakes, teas, coffees etc.. Positioned within Raffles and as expected the atmosphere is of times past. Service was impeccable with very friendly and helpful staff. I believe it will be closed soon for some restoration work to be carried out, however still keeping its atmosphere when reopening. Recommended. I'll go again when reopened and in Singapore

self service, good food, very good cafe. tried cheese cake and danish. also ceasar salat. on a sunday we were tolc that the whole place was reserved and ask to sit outside. it was hot. after 1 1/2 hrs we left and the place was still empty. outside the service was not really attentive. good food, good bred, service average

We visited Ah Teng's bakery for a brunch treat on our visit to the famous Raffles Hotel. The bakery offers a great variety of cakes, pastries and sandwiches, with afternoon tea selections also available. We opted for the cakes and pastries. I would definitely recommend the carrot cake and blueberry crumble danish in particular. The service was very good, the prices were a little more than a standard bakery but you pay for the location tucked away underneath the Raffles hotel. Cakes were around the $7 mark and pastries around $4, but well worth the money for the atmosphere of this cute bakery. Nearest MRT in City Hall, Ah Teng's is a short walk from there, on the ground floor corner of the Raffles building. A perfect pit stop before exploring the shops inside the courtyard of the hotel
4
We happen to stumble upon this place while searching for a place for breakfast. It's a self service cafe. They have breakfast sets. Had the big egg burger set with tea set. It was good but slightly pricey because this place is tied to Raffles hotel. Also due to the fact that they heat up the bacon in the cafe itself, ventilation wasn't really good and left some bacon smell on our clothes....otherwise, no complaints. Considering to go back for cakes and kuehs :
4
Ordered coffee and Nonya kueh. Good kueh and charming ambience. I like the old world charm of marble table, swing door and green stained glass
4
This business is within the Raffles complex.
Presentation, service and quality of food was very good.
There are a range of foods to choose from.
5
There is a large selection of cakes and savouries too.
They can all be washed down with a lovely cup of tea or coffee.
5
Pop in for a quick pick-me-up or an easy breakfast if you don't want the entire buffet from Raffles. Delicious coffees, and even better pastries and breads. What more could you want? Helpful and attentive and friendly staff. Definitely recommend a visit!
4
I'd heard good things about Ah Tengs, but I'd never gotten round to visiting on previous trips to Singapore, so this time I made a special effort to find it. It is very quaint and like the rest of Raffles Hotel, it exudes the feeling of a bygone era in Singaporean history. The best part of my visit was the gentleman behind the service counter, who was exceptionally friendly and helpful. The food is quite expensive and you do get little for your money, but it is good quality and the bakery items are very tasty and fresh. I'm glad I made the effort to find Ah Tengs and next time I'm in the area I will definitely stop by for another visit
4
I'm one of those people who prefer to spend on accommodation rather than on expensive restaurants. So while staying at Raffles, I would buy my breakfast at Ah Teng's, and take-away cakes for afternoon tea. Twenty years ago, we stayed at the Carlton across the road, and would also go to Ah Teng's for coffee and croissants. It's good to know that some places don't change...Prices are very reasonable, and quality excellent. Visit in the morning rather than in the evening, because although they stay open till 7 pm, there is not much left before closing time
5
Not only can you stop back a 100 years but the selection of fresh pastries and breakfast selection (eggs, omelettes etc) is a perfect start to a day of sightseeing. The staff provide gracious service, the coffee is the excellent Raffles blend and great value for money - I would say cheap compared to what is on offer on most Singapore hotel breakfast menus.I would love to have come back for a lunch or afternoon tea but did not have time - definitely for next time I'm in Singapore!There is a selection of newspapers to catch up with news of the day and a relaxing ambience
4
I love this place. I used to come here a lot when I lived in Singapore, there were still signs saying Imperial Cafe (how quaint and un-PC.), the London Times was supplied every day and Chelsea buns are no more. I'd say you might as well skip the long bar in the Raffles Hotel, which is ridiculously overpriced and touristy and enjoy some tea here instead. Prices are very reasonable considering you are actually on the Raffles Hotel premises and the cakes, pastries and sandwiches wouldn't be out of place in a Swanky London hotel or restaurant.
5
We chose the in-hotel bakery cafe for breakfast because we were short on time. You can sit inside, which looks somewhat French, or outside next to the building, where you can watch people heading to work. The man who made our coffee and served us was friendly and very helpful, and learning we would be in Port Klang and Kuala Lumpur, gave us great tips on what to eat there. He made our experience better, with his enthusiasm for food. The place was a bit quiet otherwise, so if you need bustle, you may want to head across the street to a Starbucks in the mall
5
This place is actually in the Raffles Hotel and is a delightful place for a light breakfast. We had what they call the Western set, juice, 2 croissants and really good cappuccino for $10 which is cheap for Singapore. Lovely staff too. Wanted to go back for cakes which looked beautiful but didn't get there. Highly recommended
4
Nice lunch and the price was fair.
Staff were friendly and helpful.
Lunch Sandwich set ~S$13 - S$14 and served with coffee / tea.
Caution: MRT Esplanade Exit F ( Raffles Hotel ) is under construction without notice.
4
A wonderful way to start the day in central Singapore. The "Western Set" - juice, coffee and a pastry gett the day going.
5
Part of the Raffles hotel. Serves lovely coffee cakes and croissant. Staff a bit remote and unapproachable. Newspapers available. I
5
Just the place for a refreshing break from the heat, humidity & smoke.
Beautifully presented cakes & scones to die for. A touch of the mystic east whilst retaining just the slightest echo of empire.
A Tea Rooms with a memory.
4
A nice little bakery. Quirky & unique just like Raffles itself. The service is good & the toasted ciabatta’s tasty enough. Cakes looked excellent but we didn’t indulge this time!
3
I stopped by this place during my recent visit to the Raffles hotel. I ordered Tuna puff, traditional Nyonya kuih called Ondeh Ondeh and Kuih Lapis Rainbow with Latte. Nothing special about any of them. Sadly, I had better taste Latte at McDonald's. The prices were a little bit steep considering the location. However, I love the Kuih Lapis Rainbow because it brought back childhood memory eating this cake while my family lived in Singapore. Would I come back to this place for their food? Don't think so.

I've been coming to Singapore for many years and Ah Teng's has always been a feature for afternoon tea and cakes. Unfortunately I will not be going back on my next trip and can no longer recommend it. Standards have gradually been eroded over time and what remains is definitely not a premium experience. On my last visit a few days ago the tables were covered with used crockery from previous customers: I never saw this cleared away. Tea consists of a cup of not very hot water and a sealed teabag: by the time you have unwrapped it and set it in the water it is too late to make an adequate cup. And for the price one would expect at least some additional hot water. True the cakes are good, but also pricey. One can do much better elsewhere. The place is really suffering from under-staffing. I don't see how it will survive unless things are improved considerably
4
The charming colonial setting of this cosy cafÃ© makes for a lovely, quiet ambience, best accompanied with friends and a choice of dessert and drink. I found the cheesecake to be divine and my cappuccino to be of a good standard, both of which left me satisfied. The prices are decent considering the location as well as the friendly service
4
This little bakery located at the busy corner of the Raffles Hotel sell cafe styled dishes, cakes, pasteries, coffee and tea. The decor replicates those colonial time with dark coloured wooden chairs and tables with marble top. The counter is L shaped with decent selection of pasteries, cakes and scones on display on one side and drinks counter on the other side. They do offer scone set in the afternoon. We tried their scone set which comes along a hot drink of your choice. The scone was huge and was served with butter and fruit preserves on the side ( no clotted cream!) The service was excellent and the waiter was very polite and professional. Overall, it is a good place in the city for a good afternoon Tea
2
Massive disappointment with this establishment in the renowned Raffles Hotel. Stopped in as a small group for a cup of tea/coffee and light snack - received tea comprising a china cup filled with hot/tepid water and sealed teabag. I only drink tea - no coffee- and prefer and expect it to have been served in a pot with milk on the side. This is was a very unacceptable offering from the crew at Raffles - with its English origins and snooty reputation. To top it off - i also asked for one of their scones, which i have to say looked wonderful, quite big as far as scones go and very presentable. The scone arrived with some jam - don't recall there being any butter and no cream. Again found this very average but was compounded by the actual taste of the scone that was inedible . I left both the scone and the tea essentially untouched - and the whole experience was abysmal and well over priced. This bakery seriously needs to lift their game. I would certainly not return or recommend
4
Friendly, freshly prepared food, ideal for a snack paninis and cake. Lovely coffe and the second cup was free. You can order takeaway pizza too.
3
Limited Cake Selections for an Afternoon Tea set. Even the tea selections limited. Thought we would get a better selection being Raffles Hotel. While the coffee/tea sets about $11-$12 each but not much selections as such we just picked what left. Friendly services though.
3
The Croissants were very good but the Egg/mushroom flan was very stodgy and a very limited breakfast selection, coffee was average
4
Delicious selection of home made pastries, and a wide range of drinks. Excellent service as you would expect from anything arranged by Raffles.
5
A great spot to grab a bite to eat in the raffles complex. The set sandwich option for lunch is good value, one free coffee refill is an unexpected bonus. Nice array of sweet treats and some local bites.
3
It was teatime as we decided to walk into this bakery. The chalkboard placed outside its doors attractively promoted its cake, muffin and scone sets.We went for the cake set and chose to have the carrot walnut cake and dark chocolate mille feuille accompanied with tea. Since everyone was jumping onto the SG50 bandwagon and this bakery was no exception, we decided to also check out its creation, the Slingapore cake.You cannot fault its beautifully creative cakes. Cakes always set out to do what they do best, to entice patrons to buy them. That they succeeded. However, given the price; a pot of tea would have been more appropriate as opposed to just a cup of hot water and a teabag. We were well served by Karen over the counter, who was smiling throughout the interaction despite being busy. Well done and keep up the great service. 
1
For a 5 o'clock tea: a service even less than in Mac Donald's. An ordinary tea bag in a small cup of hot water. One paper napkin for 2 people. No choice of pastries and a price that did not correspond to the food and service. Paying to the cashier before being served is from another age. It shows a real lack of hospitality as if the customer is supposed to leave without paying. Dr. Goujet from Paris Franc
4
A sort of craft bakery which offers lunches and snacks and the most amazing looking cakes. Unfortunately they only do tea by the cup and that arrives as a cup of hot water with a tea bag, I really don't understand why it's done this way. Coffee is excellent, we sampled the cakes on two occasions and weren't disappointed. It's quiet and cool, no canned music to drown out conversation and it's well patronised suggesting it's popular with the locals too
4
One of our regular tea stops when visiting Singapore...actually located closer to the North Bridge entrance and part of the Raffles Hotel building. Beach Road entrance is the actual front of the hotel and walking via that entrance is an enjoyable stroll along the shopping arcade.Great atmosphere and the cakes, sandwiches and pastries are really good and great value. Very nice cup of tea to go with it and friendly service at the counter. Scones are really big and we split one between us - would have been nice with a dollop of cream!Called in for breakfast the next morning for some very good croissants too..
5
We went around 6.25pm just 5 mins before their closing time.. but they were kind enough to have us in.. and we weren't surprised to see only 3 types of pastries left.. we tasted all 3 and they were so delicious! Added to this even the ambience was excellent and the coffee served was great as well.. overall a great experience and this should be your must visit place while holidaying at Singapore or otherwise :)
5
Found this little gem of a bakery when touring through Raffles Hotel. Truly had the best carrot 'cup' cake ever! My partner recommended the cheese cake. Coffee is good. Nice and quite cafe to sit and relax when trekking around Singapore!
4
We enjoyed a quick bite for a late breakfast. Their pain au chocolate were really nice. We also had the salmon quiche, quite nice.
4
Loved the pastries, cakes and local delights at Ah Teng's. Brings me back down memory lane seeing traditional peranakan cakes and sweets. The Danish I had was simply wonderful. The taste is as good as the bakery's ambience.
4
Ah Teng's bakery great for coffee and cake. Ah Teng's bakery great for coffee and cake. Ah Teng's bakery great for coffee and cake.

if you wanted a proper High Tea setting and you had an important client with you, or were courting a lady and wanted to impress her with your knowledge of British custom, then you should go INSIDE Raffles hotel. Ah Teng is located at the street-side of the hotel complex. a self-service establishment, their pastries are invitingly tasty, and their coffee prepared by the book 
3
Had a late morning tea at Ah Teng's Bakery with a lovely couple from the UK we met at our nearby hotel. Food beautifully displayed, you had to choose and order drinks then pay at the counter, wait for your order before taking a seat. Almost cafeteria like. Each of us ordered a sweet which looked great but unfortunately 2 of the cakes looked better than they tasted, far too sweet. Drinks were fine. The atmosphere and history of The Raffles Hotel adds to a visit. We also visited and bought from the Raffles Gift Shop
2
My partner and I visited Ah Teng's bakery for breakfast on October 24 mainly to say that we had breakfasted at Raffles (I know its not really a Raffles restaurant, but we just wanted to say that)We ordered an egg muffin each. When it came the egg part was very dry and utterly tasteless. Obviously it had been standing on the hot plate too long. The place is gloomy and uninviting and has no buzz about it. The best part was chatting with a charming employee called Alex. Avoid this place
5
The patisserie in the Raffles is the best. The cake selection superb and all eaten and enjoyed in colonial old world charm. My cake was a taste sensation, not only did it look like a million dollars with gold leaf as the decoration but an exquisite balloon of raspberry syrup was underneath mixing with the amazing raspberries and unique biscuit base.An experience to visit and enjoy
4
A lovely quaint setting in which to enjoy a reasonably priced panini and cup of tea. The lunch-set was approximately 13 Singapore Dollars which is reasonable bearing in mind this is Raffles. I had the Parma ham and mozzarella but there were other variations available.Ah Tengs also do set breakfasts - well worth checking them ou
4
Me and my family went to Singapore for vacation, we heard about Raffles' Ah Teng's Bakery, Went there for breakfast, Place was filled with breads and pastries which were very pleasing to the eyes. We ordered sandwiches which taste good. One of the reasons why ordinary sandwiches taste great is... they are fresh
4
Great coffee, great orange juice (from a bottle, but initially appeared to be freshly squeezed) and great pastries. Quick service, good value for money
5
Enjoyed our breakfast .. Ate alone in the cafe. Good coffee (yeah), yummy egg roll. Shame no Chinese meal option available but relaxing environment and hey ! We were eating in Raffles !
4
great snacks, cakes and teas served within the Raffles complex. Good service and lots of choice and the perfect little cafe to while away an hour or two.
5
One of the best chocolate croissants I have ever had. Although a bit pricey, but this is a must try.
4
We went here for breakfast everyday during our short stay in Singspore at Raffles. Needed quick easy breakfast before sightseeing and this delivered in a friendly and relaxed way. Excellent pastries and great coffee
5
Every Sunday we have our breakfast at this bakery. The atmosphere is magic, the service excellent and our kids enjoys wonderful croissant and orange juices.
3
We were very much looking forward to breakfast at Ah Teng's Bakery at the Raffles hotel. The cafe is beautiful, old world charm with nice setting - but that's about it.We arrived at 9:30am and the food display was nearly empty, it wasn't stocked yet as we found out later. We ordered each a coffee, which was very expensive but not even nice coffee.I went for the chocolate croissant, which were excellent and great value as they sold 2 croissants for $4! and my partner went for the egg and bacon burger. This was a huge dissapointment as they popped it in the microwave and heated it up. The place was apart from one other couple completely empty and lacked atmosphere and a feel good vibe. We won't be bac
5
We were looking for somewhere to have a bite to eat and came across this little gem.The service is first class for such a tiny cafÃ© and it really was nice to be served well made sandwiches and cakes for a good price.The selection of sandwiches is great, and you won't be disappointed with the cakes.A great place to relax and work out what you want to do with the rest of your day
4
We are Belgian. Every year we visit our daughter Tessa who lives in Melbourne. We like to visit the hotel and his bakery ! We have there a nice latte and a pastry..... ( I like the one with banana ). In the evening we have our connection flight to Melbourne
5
Called in a couple of times and had the egg burger for breakfast, this consists of an inch thick omelette filled with mushrooms, topped with bacon and tomato, all in a light bun. Along with a cup of tea and a total cost of under $20. Great service too.A good tasty breakfast and decent value for money in this very expensive city
5
Fun. Something to do in Singapore. We ate at Ah Teng's Bakery and Empire Cafe, good value Singapore Sling overrate and expensive. I had a Virgin Sling (no alcohol) which tasted better than my husbands with alcohol.
4
We walked here every morning for their S$10 breakfast deal of coffee, juice and pastry. Far cheaper than hotel buffet and all we really needed.
Lovely traditional cafe setting.
Peaceful setting whilst the residents rush about outside going to work.
5
We always eat there when we are in Singapore lovely pastries and cake and the coffee is good too. Very quick and friendly service, I like my coffee piping hot and that's how I got it perfect.
5
Dropped into Ah Tengs Bakery on return from a day sight-seeing, lemon tea and scone and jam. I have never eaten such a huge scone before but it was lovely and light - perfect.
4
Western breakfast set..two croissants (very big and crisp) with red jam, oj, reasonable coffee with free refills! Very nice for S$11!
5
We had one of our breakfasts here very nice and reasonably priced we also went back for lunch , having a sandwich and cake. Recommended for a visit
3
I got a few desserts for my birthday and they were good, but not great. I wish there had been more variety.
1
After a hot morning sightseeing, we decided we would try tea at Raffles, I asked two different staff if they did afternoon tea, one didn't know and the other suggested if we wanted tea we went to the shopping centre!We found the bakery and settled for a cold drink as none of the food looked any better than that found at cheap food outlets, I was charged $10 for a tiny iced tea, I couldn't believe it, I had iced tea about 3 times bigger and better for only $2 at other places.Raffles Hotel is simply trading on it's name and history but does not live up to expectations at all.Incidentally we also looked inside the famous Long Bar which was very busy and pub like.Definitely will not return
5
An excellent option for a cheaper and smaller snack at Raffles. Fresh bread, sandwiches and cakes, and immensely friendly staff, including Gary the manager.As it is tucked away in a corner of Raffles, it is probably overlooked, as was always quiet when we ate there
4
For the past few years, at Christmas time, I will make a trip to Raffles Hotel just to purchase its Christmas Stollen - for my family and for friends. Raffles Hotel bakes wonderful stollens and I love the texture and what touches me most is the good customer service of the counter staff at Ah Teng's Bakery.when you pass by this bakery which is conveniently located along Bras Basah Road and Beach Road, drop in for a coffee, a snack or if you like, a meal full of local colours - cuisine which only Singapore can offer
5
just a good place for starting your day with a cup of coffee that is specially made by raffles ( the brand is japanese)
5
The tea specials and the ambience are very remniscent of a bygone era. The fare is yummy. Love the quaint crockery that the Tea and sides are served in. Nice to sit and watch the world go by, too.
3
Nestled in a quiet corner of the esteems Raffles Hotel, this is the epitome of an old fashioned tea house with its dark wood and marble tables. The typical Raffles Hotel service and efficiency (quick to offer to doggy- bag my uneaten muffin when I had an unexpected phonecall), Just shame that the food & beverage offering is so limited. Either very Western croissants, coffee or kueh lapis
4
Bent wood tables and chairs, a rack of newspapers to peruse and friendly, good, if quite slow service. Choices are limited but all good. If you just want a sandwich, this is the place for lunch, in fact the only egg salad sandwich we found in the Far East aside from Subway in Bangkok! Also the smoked salmon sandwich was delicious. Tea is not my thing, but I found the cafe Americano to be wonderful. If toucan wait till two pm, you must try the scones, but they go quickly and if you come too late you could be disappointed. As long as you know the limitations, you will have a wonderful, Colonial-paced time
2
Was lashing rain to headed to Ah Tengs bakery for tea and scones. What a dissapointment. Only 3 in the afternoon but hardly anything (left) in the display. On display were 5 bottles of water and a small salad in a plastic bowl! Self service too, I dont think so at those prices for tea. We headed out to the hawker center for a better dining experience. Thanks but no thanks Ah Teng. We wont be back
1
Had an excellent piece of cake, which was yummy and cost 6 sing dollars which I thought was reasonable given the location. However I also had an english breakfast tea which cost 10 sing dollars (£5). For that price I would have expected looseleaf tea served in a tea pot, but no, what I got was a tea bag served on the side of about 200ml of luke warm wter. It was reasonably good tasting tea but at that price was a complete joke
4
Located in a corner of the famous Raffles Hotel, Ah Teng's is lovely cool place to relax from the heat of a Singapore day. A range of hot and cold drinks is offered, and a range of food, including some lovely cakes. Its an "Olde Worlde" kind of place, Bentwood chairs and tables, tiled floor, and the history of Raffles all around. Prices are not the cheapest in Singapore, but the service is good, and food is too
4
I love this cafe. It's a regular lunch time haunt for me. It's nice and quiet away from the hustle and bustle, and I like the decor. It reminds me of old cafes in long forgotten seaside towns in the UK! Quite formal but pleasantly serene. Service can be a little slow but they do make nice sandwiches :
2
I expected more of this restaurant that is tucked away in a corner of the Raffles Hotel; but this one is trading more on it's connection to the hotel rather than on food or service. The food was ok, small portions. Not much selection if you are a vegetarian. The menu said that the vegetable curry included rice, pickles and dahl. When it arrived, there was no dahl - and I was told "it was in the sauce". So why list it as a side when it's actually an ingredient; and in that case, might as well list the ginger, cumin and cocounut milk while you are at it... sorry, rant over.The service was not great either - lots of staff running around, but none actually making any eye contract, and I had to ask for my bill three times. Again - a real pity, given the history of this place. If you happen to be in the area, don't waste your money in the main dining room of Ah Teng's Bakery - a quick coffee and pastry in the bakery section would be better value, and you still get to soak up the atmosphere of old-world Singapore. And if you really do end up eating in the main dining area - then go with the Hainan Chicken Rice, which is a basic dish difficult to mess up. Fingers crossed
4
Decided as we couldn’t afford to stay at Raffles Hotel, we would opt for the cheaper alternative of a light breakfast in the Ah Teng bakery/café instead.The café/bakery offers four set breakfast menus, the Western one being SGD$11. For this you get a glass of fresh juice, tea or coffee and a choice of pastry from the cabinet.Not the most filling of breakfast, but nice for the experience of saying you have eaten in the Raffles complexTax was included in the SGD$11 and there is no service charge
3
I go to Ah Teng's Bakery regularly more as a pit stop and not so much to to sample their food and drink. The cakes and sandwiches are average, and so is the beverage.
4
Great pies
2
Really bad local food for tourists. Whatever you do don't try to "Peranakan' specials. They stink.
3
liked the quiche
4
good place for a chit chat and snack
3
Aircon is damn cold and the small seats and small round marble tables give a chilly feel to the place. A traditional bakery with coffee and tea served nothing special although you may want to eat out in the sheltered courtyard once you have collected your food
2
My credit card gives me discounts at the Raffles eating establishments, and I try to justify using it. However the quality of the eating/dining experience at Ralles is always such a let down. This time we were shopping across the street at Raffles City and decided it could be nice to have a light snack at Raffles Hotel, rather than the usual run of the mill places inside the mall. We decided on Ah Teng's. I was initially put off by the lackluster display of food and pastries in the display counters and as well that there is hardly any staff. We both had tea and some sort of pastry. I ordered mine as a set, and was surprised that in the end my wife's tea alone cost more than my set, despite the only difference being a slightly different style pastry. She did enjoy hers, but my muffin was not a muffin in any sense. Just a try cake shaped like a muffin. The tea itself was good quality, being TWG, but at these prices and in this setting I would expect more than just a teabag and a cup with hot water. A bit more flare should accompany this location. Having to self serve in a hotel tea-house is odd. If the room were to give us that throw back feeling it would be great, but despite it's timed elegance, it just comes across as cold and dreary. Overall Raffles itself has no atmosphere aside from it's architecture. It's shops and restaurants seem dull. I guess it's due that Raffles Hotel is just located in what is today not a very good location, and misses a genuine flow of people from the surrounding area. In HK if you were at The Peninsula or The Mandarin, the public spaces would constantly be full of atmosphere. Unfortunately Rafflles just seems to be a sleep old queen, that just has not stepped up to attracting anything but tourists

We visited Ah Teng's bakery as part of the Raffles tour with Viator. We opted for the "light refreshments" and were taken to Ah Teng's bakery round the back of Raffles Hotel. Here we were sat down as part of a group and served a large portion of very delicious rich chocolate truffle cake. While I would have preferred choice in cake I wasn't going to complain with this one, but others in the group weren't happy!The tea was apparently very good, and hot water refills were available. The Coffee was also included. We had been warned that any other drinks etc were not included in the package cost, which was fine. I ordered a Coke Light as I don't drink tea or coffee and was pleased that they served it. I was less pleased when the bill came soon after. For approximately a can's worth, maybe less, they charged me SIN$10.60! I was in shock!There was a fabulous poster up outside that said "How can one resist the temptation to go shopping at Raffles?" To which the answer is: buy a Coke Light first
1
We went for tea and cake one afternoon during our recent stay in Singapore. This was by far our most disappointing experience. There was very little atmosphere and the staff seemed barely interested and unhelpful, very unlike the rest of Sngapore! The self service style was not in keeping with the tea room setting. There was a limited choice of cake and the quality of ours was poor compared to other small Mall cafes. The worst thing was the tea, it was a cup of hot water with a teabag dropped in! No teapot, not pot of hot water. Don't bother to pay ridiculously high prices for such a poor experience
2
We had breakfast at Ah Teng's Bakery last weekend. To our disappointment, the food was exorbitant. With the same food quality, I can get it from the normal coffee houses at less than half the price. $7.50 for three slices of bread, coconut jam, served with coffee/ tea... the ambience has that 70's look otherwise, it has no competitive edge against the good old traditional coffee houses located at the neighborhood areas. nay, I will give it a miss
4
nice cakes!

Don't just head for the breads and pastries! GO FOR THE CAKES! Their cakes are my all-time fav!
