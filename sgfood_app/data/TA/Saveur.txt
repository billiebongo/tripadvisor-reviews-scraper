went with girlfriend and she was happy because long time never eat this restaurant already. my duck confit was salty and her pasta was salty also, so this restaurant foods look to be salty
4
Would have preferred more space between tables and seats as it is quite tight maneuvering around. Food was great and the truffle fries were really tasty stomach fillers.
4
Visited the restaurant at ard 6pm weekend, not so crowded,the food is yummy, but charge us for water $ 0.30
4
was disappointed with saveur cooking/food std in mid 2017. decided to give it a chance and revisited again at the far east outlet. both the seabass and duck confit are done perfectly. will be back again
4
Decent French fare at affordable prices. Had the duck confit and truffle fries, which were fragrant and tasty.
5
Loved the casual and inexpensive dining experience. Food is great as usual and the usuals must tries are the truffle fries, duck confit and more! Yums.
5
Nice authentic food, value for money. Reservation was a breeze. Food was served promptly without error. Generally a pleasant visit above expectation.
5
Service was better than my previous visit and food was served quick and good! Happy with my visit this time round!
4
My hubby and I both ordered the Duck Confit and it turned out that the dish was very good. Our kid ordered steak. It's not too bad either. Worthwhile to note that the waiters/waitresses are friendly and they even treated my hubby a slice of cake as it was his birthday
4
Enjoyed the duck confit at Saveur a couple of days ago. Wasn't the best I've had, but reasonable, all things cnsidered. Prices are reasonable for SG, so good value. We went at 1PM, and had no issue getting in. Service was okay, but hardly outstanding. Overall, recommended, but don't expect too much...
4
Restaurant was not crowded when we reached. Food was served pretty fast. Staff were helpful and friendly.
3
Saveur serves decent french food at affordable prices, especially with the Entertainer app. The tables near the wall are too close to each other though, allowing you to hear other people's conversations. The sea bass is lacking compared to other mains.
4
Good value for price! Personally prefer the Purvis street branch because it has a nicer atmosphere but the dishes are good across branches
5
Ordered duck confit, chilli crab pasta and sautee potatos with crab meat.
Duck confit was excellent as well as pasta. But sautee potatoes with vrab meat was dry and slightly flavourless
4
Saveur at orchard. Want some cheap and good semi fine dining food? This is the place! No other places in the area serves cheaper food than here that are good.
4
The food is very good and good casual atmosphere. The value is very good for the price and the service is good as well.
5
My Boyfriend and I shared the angel hair pasta, duck confit and the pork belly. Everything tasted fantastic! Didnâ€™t really like the accompaniments with the pork belly though. Food was served quickly as well, probably because we were there around 6pm on a Saturday, before the crowd came in.
4
The duck confetti and saveur pasta are their must-order signatures dishes. I would suggest ordering a main course each and sharing sides like truffle fries or saveur pasta (starter portion).The restaurant is pretty dim and the tables can be quite close to each other so there is not much privacy.
1
Haven't been to Saveur for awhile and I got reminded why. Went in, got ignored by first waitress. Had to signal to another guy to bring us to the table. Waited 10 minutes for someone to take out order and no one did. Signalled to a waiter that we were ready to order, he replied me with a hand sign asking me to wait. 5 minutes later, he was still standing there crowd watching. The last straw came when I tried to get another waitress to take my order and she walked past me like I wasn't there.I think I must be a ghost or somethin
4
I like their salmon confit. It's tender and moist, cooked to my liking. The dish comes with a slice of fried salmon skin which is thin and crisp. Very nicely done. Another appetizer that I like is the foie gras which is nicely seared and done. Would have been better if it is served with poached pears or peaches rather than lentils.A nice main course is the duck confit. The skin of the duck confit is well crisp and fragrant though the meat is a little salty for my taste.
3
Too noisy to have a proper conversation. The food is a little bit too salty. Will be better if we could have inside seats.
5
Duck confit and foie gras is good! Service was prompt and the ambience is very conducive. Price was reasonable
4
Hv been to Saveur at least 5 times. Every time I am satisfied with their food quality at such a reasonable price!
4
Went on a Friday evening and the place was crowded so I think it's better to make a reservation first. The food was good and price is affordable. The service staff were also attentive to us.
4
Menu kinda haven't change for years, but they were decent for the price you pay. Service was okay, nothing quite memorable.
1
Saveur has always been praised for it's good customer service but it was a horrible experience for me yesterday.First of all, I was rudely attended by a waiter when I entered the restaurant. He spoke to me from afar and shouted to ask if I've made a reservation. Secondly, I was utterly disappointed to realise that the prices had increased so much as compared to my previous visit. That aside, I was hoping this price increase would justify my dining experience there. However, it took us a good 15 minutes trying to get the attention of the waiters. This was because my partner and I were being SEEN and IGNORED, not once, not twice but MULTIPLE times. While the wait for food wasn't long, one of our orders were overlooked and was not served. As if that was already not bad enough, we struggled AGAIN to get the attention of the waiters. This was NOT because we couldn't be seen or heard but simply BECAUSE your waiters CHOSE to IGNORE us even after ACKNOWLEDGING our presence. My disappointment soon turned into frustration as this happened MANY times and we gave up in the end.We were wrongly charged for our bill (as it included the item that never came) when we proceeded to pay but was met with a churlish stare from your waiter as he leaned over to check if we were lying. No apologies were made. Lastly, as we paid in cash, our change of $4.70 were given in denominations of 50cents, 20cents and 10cents by your waiter. I believe it was to spite us because I saw bigger notes in the cash box. This is extremely rude and unacceptable. I expected a much higher level of service from your company but the experience last night left me tremendously disappointed. I hope you will take the appropriate actions and prevent this from ever happening again
3
Went down specially to try Saveur's Festive Set for Christmas, was disappointed to find out only upon ordering that the Beef Rossini was out of stock (they should have told us when we sat down). Service wasn't great as the staff were not attentive but the food was good as usual
4
overall experience is good but just air conditioning of the resturant need to be improved. the food portion is a bit smaller but still tasty. the price at orchard area is considered reasonable. a good place to catch up with friends and family. atmosphere is nice there too
4
Ordered 2 sets of set lunch, Chicken breast and duck confit. Food still taste as good. Cash vouchers are not applicable for set lunch. This was not told prior to order, not stated on menu nor on the voucher. Staff called office and was kind enough to allow me to use my cash vouchers
5
I was here before in September then I happened to be back in Singapore again on November.of course , I've decided to visit this place one more time.the food was really good and I actually do not understand why people are complaining that the service was bad....I went there eating alone and they treated me so nice.maybe because I went there alone so they don't want to make me feel more sad lol haha anyway, I hope my photos are useful for people who are skeptical about this restaurant ;
3
Food is good.
Service staff needs reminders on my requests. Staff were also less than hygienic - they were touching their hair, wiping perspiration before serving food.
4
There was a Slight change in textire for the roasted pork belly. The truffle fries was good. Saveur pasta was good too!
4
Service was quick and timely. Food came very quickly. Although mains came before the appetiser. Nonetheless, the appetiser was so small that it didn't matter. Perhaps the appetiser ought to be a larger portion! Mains tasted great and looked good too.
5
Food was good as usual. Tried the new duck confit burger, nothing special. I personally prefer duck confit if comparing to duck confit burger.
4
Many reviews said this is quality french cuisine at pocket-friendly price but I beg to differ. It is just a very average French cuisine with room for improvement in the service level.
4
Am a repeat customer of this place and I never get bored of the food. Always good quality at decent prices.
4
I came here on my friends recommendation. The set lunch was affordable and tasty. The pasta was fine and delicious. The main course of chicken was also good. For dessert, I took a creme brulee which was awesome. Will return again.
2
The food was not bad however the service was not satisfying. Waiters are like waiting for each other to do the job. Called for waiter to order, all 3 saw us but none came, we have to call them a second time for them to come take our orders
4
I liked that we could make the reservation via chope. The food took a rather long time to be served and the staff weren't particularly attentive. However, they do respond quickly when we request for stuff so that made it all better. My friends and I enjoyed the food very much.
4
The duck was tender and cooked to perfection - the obvious choice in the set lunch menu. Appetizers were varied and since there were 4 of us, we had the melt-in-the-mouth fois gras, mushroom soup, pasta and salad. Since it was lunch time on a weekday, it was quiet at the restaurant. Staff were friendly and attentive.
4
Food was good and delicious. Great for gathering with friends and family for meals.
Service is good too. :)
5
Good place (with nice ambiance) to catch up with peers.
The Duck confit & Saveur pasta never fails to please. The creme brûlée was also very good!
5
Food portion was great, overall a pleasant dining experience at saveur far east outlet. Will visit again
3
Value for money but do not go with high expectation.
Not a place to go if you are expecting a classy French restaurant
4
love the food here. their chili crab squid ink pasta and saveur signature pasta (you can order as main although in menu only shown for appetizer) are amazing! the service somehow is a little slow
3
We had the set lunch on a Sat afternoon. Food is decent but dessert choice is limited. The service rendered was good.
3
Decent food at reasonable prices, worth the try! Suitable for gatherings as well. Customer service can be improved.
2
My 1st visit was at Saveur Art at ION, it was a pretty good experience and the food was yummilious. But too bad ION branch was permenantly closed, so I chosed the Far East branch to bring my friend to have lunch . But the food was a total disappointment, will not go again in future
4
The steak au poivre was really nice, and so was the duck confit. The steak au poivre was reminiscent of the original steak dish they had at Saveur Art, but was removed subsequently in a menu revamp. The beef was cooked to perfection (I ordered medium rare), and the mashed potato was incredibly smooth. The reason for the 4 stars, instead of a 5, was due to the cashier, who made a calculation hiccup over a simple discount, and which caused me to have to make a call back to the restaurant in order to get my refund. The service staff were extremely cordial about it though, and overall I have to say that I am pleased with the service, and will most definitely return in the near future again
3
Although there's lack of manpower and the staffs are not efficient and "act like they didn't see your hands" when you want to order your food , still the food is good . But for the food , can you be quick ? It took 20 mins to wait for our food , that's so bad !
3
Had 2 set lunches. Pasta was great, but foie gras lacks taste. Duck was crispy and beef moist, both flavourful. Texture of crème brûlée needs improvement! Overall, very affordable and good service :)
4
Great food at affordable rates! Had the crab meat pasta and the duck confit and both were really good!
3
Food was alright . Long waiting time even though it wasnt crowded. A affordable restaurant right at town!
4
Ordered the dinner set course and ala-carte items for two pax. Unlike other dinner sets, Saveur actually provided a wider range of food selections avail for selection than most, making the set course worth it!
4
Having dinner with friends at Saveur during the weekday, not much crowd. Food is value for money, not bad.
4
The food was quite tasty! The dinner set was value of money too, definitely recommend students to come here!
5
Invited British friends to lunch here. They enjoyed it tremendously. It was easy getting a table. Food yummy and service was great.
4
Looking for a casual fuss-free, reasonably priced place for lunch. Located conveniently at the ground level of Far East Plaza facing the taxi stand, this cafe serves modern Fusion French-European fare.Prices are about $16-20 for main dishes and set meals are $22-28 for 3-course. The cafe is decorated in a simple modern bistro style, can seat about 60-80 persons.
4
Food quality is consistent. Our choice of can drinks wasn't available though. We asked for 2 root beer, staff said only 1 can is left. So I asked for 1 can of green tea then staff said they are only left with Sprite. Can drinks are basics. Restaurant should keep them replenished
5
I had the beef bourguiganon which was tender,aromatic and silky smooth mash. My friend had the grilled sea bass. Prices were very reasonable even the quality and standard of cooking. Only disappointment was the sangria which was too sweet. Other than that, highly recommend the place for gathering with friends or even a casual date
4
Very suitable for causual dining... The most enjoyable dish is duck confit, super tender... saveur pasta is nice too!
5
We had the lunch set which came with the starter, main and dessert. Pretty good value at $22.90. We came here for a birthday lunch with our family, and the kids really enjoyed the Saveur pasta and duck confit.
3
Food was served promptly and tasted good, but service could be better - we had issues with our final bill and it took a really long time to settle.
4
Ambience is better than ion orchard. But the foie gras was a bit undercooked. The duck confit was great. Panna cotta was awesome
4
really affordable and tasty thus 2nd return within a few months. cozy environment. must try the duck!
5
Delicious food, cosy environment. Recommended for Couples. Affordable price. Make reservation early to avoid dissapointed.
4
We ordered the dinner set meal that came with a starter, main and dessert each. Food was delicious and portions hearty. Would come again ☺️
3
We ordered the Saveur Duck Confit and it is bad compare to the previous times. it is too dry and it actually dont look appetizing.
4
After a change of owners, i thought the standard of the food would have dropped but i was glad it didn't. it still taste as good as before. Their lunch set meal is so worth it. I get to eat my fav pasta appetizer and duck confit! I will definitely go back again
4
We first went to their original outlet at Purvis street. Food was good but restaurant was cramp and parking wasn't too convenient. Missing their signature Duck Confit, we booked once again but at Far East outlet this time. I'm glad their food quality is consistent at different outlets. We experienced a technical hitch on this recent visit. Far East outlet had no internet connection and couldn't accept credit card and our chope voucher! We ended up waiting for a long time for payment. At ordering, the staff told us we can't order set dinner or enjoy other promotions bcoz we are using voucher so we only ordered ala carte than at payment they said internet is down, voucher can't be accepted. That got us quite mad initially but the staff were still nice and told us to give them some time and we did. Eventually, everything was settled and we will still return
5
They do not understand the concept of different courses, but then I suppose we should not expect fine dining. The duck and salmon confits were perfectly done, pistachio pants cotta was delightful.
4
the 3 course dinner was quite good. Except that the waitress messed up our orders. I was served with Foie Gras although I ordered Salmon Confit. And We order 1 glass of red wine, but was charged with 3 glasses. Do check your bills closely.
5
Had the set meal - the mushroom soup, chicken & ice cream. The chicken was a surprising dish. Came with rice & was very yummy.
4
We ordered the truffle fries,beef bourguignon and duck confit, and they were pretty good. The serving size of the desserts was a little too small though, and the service was slow as the place was packed.
3
Quality of food was better when they first started. For my latest visit, there was hardly any crab meat in my pasta dish; only had shreds of them. Overall, it's pretty good value for $ for non-fussy eaters.
4
Love this place. Affordable in a good central location. Perfect portion. Tasty. Fast service. Highly recommended
4
First time to this branch and the place is noisy on a Friday night due to reflective walls. Didn't notice this in the original branch at purvis street. Food was still good and not forgetting my fav foie gras though the portion with the set dinner seems smaller den the original sized. Discount with standard chartered card. Would go back again if near the area
2
Restaurant offered a menu of French dishes but when they arrived, none of them tasted anything near to French cooking. The boef bourguignon was the worst dish of the lot. The pieces of meat were so tough I don't believe they have been simmered for 2 hours over low heat, which is what this recipe calls for.Overall, a very poor show
4
Great dishes at a great price point. However manpower is short, had to go to the water station to get my own water as there is no system in place for the staff to look after tables. Not well coordinated staff but v good food. A restaurant I find myself going back to again and again
4
My last visit must have been more than a year. Somehow, I am not feeling terribly satisfying today. It was very good but not excellent. Our favourite pasta didn't taste quite the same too.The duck confit is on the dry side and the mash used to be creamier. I think the price of the foie gras has been adjusted upward to $12.90. It used to be $7.90 or $9.90 not exactly sure. The price adjustments probably affect most items of the menu.
5
A very affordable French cuisine restaurant. I personally always order the duck confit, onion soup and chocolate mousse whenever I dine at Saveur. Definitely worth recommending for.
2
Food taste standard dropped drastically. Mushroom soup used to be piping hot but now is just normal soup that is not even hot. Heard the chef head left so maybe this is the reason. Service was bad as well. ): not gonna come back
4
Reasonavle variety of interesting items on menu, with kind and helpful staff who were polite and helpful. Delicious food and welcoming, cozy dining space
4
The food is good and affordable. The duck confit is good, but was disappointed about the squad ink pasta. The ingredients is not comparable with the price.
4
First time at this restaurant, the food was good especially the pastas. The angel hair pasta with Sakura ebi was very delicious. The squid ink pasta was good but portion was a bit small for main course.
5
The food arrived quickly and the service was really great! The portion is well prepared and fills your tummy quickly!
We went for the Duck Confit from the Ala Carte Menu. It didn't disappoint at all.
3
Food was good and service was great as well. Didn't have to wait long for the food to be served at all.
5
Went for dinner and didn't disappoint. The set dinner was affordable and topped up for foie gras. Prettt satisfying dinner
4
Has the duck confit and it was tasty. Comparable to costlier establishments. The mash was creamy and delicious. Duck was tender but not so that it lost any texture. Presentation was good as well. Overall the food was good. Good enough that I would definitely come back and try the other dishes.Just don't expect any ambience. The decor and furnishing were nice but the noise spoilt the atmosphere. There was cutlery being washed and separated. And for some reason they were being thrown about. You can imagine the noise. There were also two separate groups of youngsters talking at the top of their voices.In short, I would come back and even recommend others for the food. But don't come here if you're looking for some quiet or romantic place.
4
This is my nth visit. The food was wonderful as usual. Would recommend the salmon confit (fave) - buttery indulgence. Their signature pasta and duck confit is good as well. Finish the night off with the salted caramel lava cake. My dinner companion is still having dreams about it.
3
The appetisizer foi gras was very tasty, the main dish duck comfit was a bit dry,the dessert pistachio was excellent.
in terms of ambience , it was a let down versus my experience at purvis street outlet a few years ago
4
I love the duck and the pasta! I brought my friends here. They love it too! However, sadly the Chope voucher could not be used for lunch set, that was a total disappointment.
Please keep it the good work! Will dine here again for sure!
5
Tried the new duck confit burger. I guess my expectation was too high as I felt the burger tasted quite average. I think perhaps if there was a little bit of sauce it could improve the overall flavour of the burger?
4
Good place for a lunch and dinner or a catchup with friends. Definitely give the pasta and duck confit a go!
4
Met a group of friends for dinner! Shared the pasta and truffle fries! The duck confit did not disappoint! It was really good! :D
3
Our family brought my brother out for dinner on his birthday but was told that they had ran out of steak on that day. The same thing happened when he wanted to order one of the cocktails. It seems strange that the restaurant did not actually stock up on a Friday night and they could have told us upfront after showing us the table. We will probably try other outlets next time instead of coming back here.
4
Saveur serves one of the best duck confit that I've tried. Crispy (& crackling) skin coupled with soft, tender meat that one can tear off the bone effortlessly. In addition, their signature saveur pasta is a must-try! The angel hair pasta, Sakura ebi and pork sauce is an awesome combination. Delicious regardless whether it's served warm or cold.
3
Mushroom soup was palatable . Portion was big. Had the duck confit . Sides were good - mushrooms and mashed potatoes. However, the duck meat was over fried, dry, salty and tough.Dessert was the best. When we walked in, we were told there was a 15% discount for Mother's Day promotion. However, upon payment, we were told it was not applicable on eve of public holiday. Terms & condition did not state. Furthermore, promotion dates on the poster differs. Big print states from 6-14 May but terms & conditions fine print states from 6-15 May. It did not state not applicable during eve of public holiday. Rather disappointed
4
Made a reservation through Chope's mobile app and was given only 8 seats but however, the in-charge hurriedly set up a table for 9 before we even ordered our food. The server on the floor who was taking our orders should put a smile on her face when receiving our orders or when replying to us. It could mislead people that she is unhappy about the customers' request, etc.The food and ambience however, have compensated for the bad point! Love the Chilli Crab Squid Ink Pasta especially! It tasted amazingly good. I will make a return trip the next time round with my partner and hope it is still as good as my previous trip
4
We went to the far east outlet which allowed dinner reservations as the main Purvis street one did not. The reservation process went smoothly, I called to change the number of people coming with no issue. The food there is consistently good as I've been here many times before, however the service this time was not particularly good. We were seated in the corner, and we did not get a refill of water once, and getting their attention was a challenge.
4
Food are superb, with very reasonable price. Only thing is food serving time is long, not sure if it's during non peak hour hence lesser cook :p worth to visit again :)
4
nothing special or wow, just avg in almost everything/aspect.
tables are arranged too close to one another, very food court feel
5
Was crowded, thankfully I made reservations before hand else there is a waiting time of 30 mins or longer depending on the amount of pax. Should try their signature duck confit and avoid the truffle fries as it is disappointing.
5
i experienced a very good service in saveur. they gave us a complimentary dessert as it was my friend's bday. thanks!!!
5
Food was good and very reasonably priced. Portions were substantial. My 2 boys loved it! We will definitely return !
5
The set dinner was good and worth the money. Love the service too. Will definitely go again soon! :)
4
Salmon confit is a must try. Value for money and its delicious. Also another item which is my fav is saveur pasta which is really light and tasty.
4
Regular customer of Saveur. Great duck confit at very reasonable price. They do offer delicious 3 course set dinner at $29.90 too!
4
The last time I visited Saveur, I had their Creme Brulee and Lobster Bisque. Those two were sooooo good. Even though Saveur still serve good and affordable food, I still miss those two. Hope they brings it back!
4
Been a while since we last ate at this restaurant. If it was my first time here, I would say the food was awesome for its price. But it seems like the quality of the food has dropped slightly. The duck confit isn't as nice as a couple of years back.
5
Had the pasta and seabass, delicious, timely service of food with appropriate gaps between apps and mains
4
Nice food ! Cosy place to gather with friends ! Love the ambience of the restaurant lovely ! Thank you ! Need to improve on service !
3
They used to be so much better. Now, food is underseasoned and my once favourite salmon confit is no longer prepared in the same way. Very disappointing.
4
Not as impressive as my first visit here more than a year ago. Garden Salad was awesome but steak was so-so. But it's quite affordable for French food so it's ok if you are not gona b too fussy. Will return for casual dining
5
This is one of my favourite places to have nice French food! The must try are saveur pasta, salmon confit, duck confit and pistachio panna cotta! The dishes are well presented and served really quickly!
3
It was my first time to the restaurant and the staff was not able to make a recommendation of a good spot to have a work lunch. She left the choice of the seating to me.
Thankfully the quality of the food wasn't disappointing.
4
I am not an IT-savvy person but I am amazed that I was able to do this chope booking so easily without anybody's help. It really is user-friendly and I recommend others to use it. What's more...there are chope $ to redeem.
4
Their popular starter, shrimp angel hair pasta was al dente and great in whetting my appetite for the mains. Foie gras was delicious and so was the duck confit. The latter was juicy on the inside while the skin was nicely crisp on the outside. The mash potato accompanying it was creamy and addictive! The only downside was the mushroom soup (tasted more like watery cream soup. Prob came from a can).
2
Pro:-Service level is still there. Only good thing is that the appetitizer spaghetti hasn't drop in quality.Cons:1.The duck confit with the meshed potatoes was a disappointment. The meshed potato no long have the wow taste. The duck has shrunk in size. Worst the price has increased!2. Lunch set meal used to come with a choice of desserts, now it only comes with a tiny scoop of vanilla ice-cream. (I'm done with just two spoon)3. The pork belly main use to be serve as one big piece, now it comes in 3 tiny slices.If they want return customers, they need to go back to the quality of food they used to provide at least one year ago
5
This was our first time dining at Saveur after hearing many positive reviews. We were pleasantly surprised to see the set dinner being offered on a Sunday evening. While it was a little disappointing that they ran out of coffee, the food definitely exceeded our expectations! Service was good too. Highly recommended for couples or small groups
3
Serving of main course too fast.when we have not even finished our salad. But overall value for money
4
Busy atmosphere is to be expected as its always packed. However, service is still very fast and the food is always good! Highly recommend the Duck Confit and the Saveur Pasta
4
Great place to hang out with your family/ friends. Price is wallet friendly & food is good. Be sure to make reservation as the place is always crowded
2
The steak was terrible - looks like minced meat and was not cooked well. Had only two mouthfuls and gave up. This was also told to the waitress and sincerely hope our feedback was heard.
5
Food was good.
They had promo for pasta for 1 dollars with 1 main course.
It is always ideal to make a reservation because it's always crowded.
5
Set dinner was value for money, dessert was of good quality too. Will definitely revisit again......
5
We made the reservation about an hour before going to the outlet. When we reached there,we were guided to our seats immediately. Overall very good and efficient service. Thank you!
1
Very long waiting time >45mins. Awful food where particular dish are mass cooked. Totally not worth the visit!
4
We had the 3 course set lunch and surprisingly, it was the starters that stood out the most. The mushroom soup was thick but not too creamy, and the Saveur's Pasta was perfectly seasoned when tossed. The mains were great too, especially the Duck Confit which tore easily from the bone
3
Ordered a sea bass, slightly disappointed but the $1 pasta that comes with every main ordered was pretty descent! Environment wise it was kind of stuffy the night we visited, recommend to people who are looking for something elegant dishes to eat but not so much on the pricey side
4
Food is very nice & presentable, price is reasonable & cheap, environment a bit noisy, service quite ok. Worth to try la.
4
We ordered set dinner and had the ever popular chicken thigh and duck confit. The quality of the food is always there. Overall experience was very good. Please be reminded to make reservation especially for Friday or Saturday dinner.
4
One of my favorite hangouts. The signature Saveur pasta is always a crowd pleaser. Affordable house wine. Service is great. Great place for simple gatherings with friends. Recommended.
4
If you consider the portions, not very cheap actually. But food's always decent and a good place for french food thats not overtly pretentious
4
Enjoyed the duck confit with truffle mashed potatoes and parents liked the saveur pasta. Online booking made reservation convenient. Walked afterwards to nearby mall to catch a late night movie. Great evening overall.
3
the saveur pasta is good as usual but than the duck confit has dropped slightly in standard.
they were selling new year's cookies but i think the cookies were not nice.
4
Went there for new year's eve dinner. Very busy and all of the waitress were overwhelmed. However, good food as always...
4
Came for lunch on a Sunday. Have been a regular patron of this restaurant due to its affordable pricing and quality food, which is well worth the price. Another plus is that they take reservations, which many other restaurants of this price range don't do. Came with a big group and we ordered one of each main dish to try. Would recommend the Saveur's Pasta, Duck Confit and Sea Bass. Done-ness of the steak wasn't really on point - ordered a medium but came mostly medium rare; might be a problem for those who are particular about it but we didn't really mind. Service was decent as well
4
The service was excellent. The staff were very helpful and attentive during the busy hour. The staff were also very helpful to ensure that special dietary requirements were catered for as well.The presentation of the food was good. The french onion soup was savory and nice. The duck was excellent - melts in your mouth but I wish there was more of it
4
We had the French Onion Soup and the Pork Belly, both had surpassed our expectations.The pork belly which was somewhat like the chinese-styled crispy roast pork was accompanied by a flavourful bean gravy and flowy egg. Service was prompt and the staff were pleasant. Will definitely go back
4
Food is a bit salty.. Front desk service is not satisfied but the food serving is fast.. Overall is satisfied.
2
It was a night celebrating my wife's birthday. We reserved a table. However, we were given a table among the crowded diners even though there were many empty tables away from the crowded diners. It was so difficult to get the attention of the waitresses.
4
crowded all the time , make sure you make a reservation if not you will have to queue wait for your seat. No hostess.
4
but restaurant seems abit short staffed. The waitresses seem abit flustered by the volume of lunchtime crowd on a post Xmas day.
The food was nice. Ordered their pork belly which was cooked to right crispiness in a baked bean broth.
3
recommend to try their saveur's pasta, only $4.9, ofcoz small portion but it tastes pretty nice. also try their onion soup, roasted chicken on truffle mashed potato and pork belly; all are so-so taste
5
The tenderloin steak is awesome! Good place for a meal. And price was reasonable despite being on a public holiday
4
The food was delicious and inexpensive.
The duct confit and prawn pasta is recommended. The porsion is quite small
2
Service is horrible, all the service staff are not friendly at all, no smile, no expression.We told one of the staff that we do not want ice in our ice lemon tea, she gave us the look like we are very cheapskate and replied then the amount in the cup will be lesser. Why need to tell us that like we purposely ask for no ice so that we can have more lemon tea in the cup?? The food was ok only, nothing special also. Maybe because of the pricing. I will not visit again with this service and food quality even if the price is reasonable
4
Have been dining at Saveur at Far East several times and am glad that the quality of food has been consistently good! Tried a new item on their menu this time, truffle fries, but the food quality wasn't up to their usual standard - fries tasted a little stale and "re-fried". Other than that, overall experience was still great
3
Perhaps is a holiday so the staffs don't seem to be proactive in many ways.. Firstly we had made prebooking but the person in charge seemed very lost in checking on our booking. I even had to help the person to find. Next, we were blurry served to the table without any menu given. We had to request personally fr the stages aft waiting for 10min. Thereafter when I requested for a baby chair, it came only aft second reminder. Food was served in a rather confused manner. Drinks were only served aft we had reminded them and had eaten halfway. Quality of food was below what I had read fr reviews. Hope the place can brush up on their awareness and service to achieve better customer satisfaction cos seemed like the staffs are rather disoriented.
3
When I first stepped into the restaurant, I was not being welcomed and the person just showed her hand like stating that that was my reservation. As the place was very empty that time so I assumed that was my table.
4
Food is delicious especially duck confit and salted caramel lava cake! Ambience and decoration are very nice.
3
The food is average with reasonable pricing. Service staff is friendly and prompt. The premise does not feel clean as the table we sat at was sticky.
4
Food is still awesome at Saveur but was disappointed that my favourite dish, Chicken Roulade had been taken off the menu. Hope it will be back!
1
Waitresses are rude. don't seem to care when custs walk in. Many dishes are 'out of stock'. Will not visit the far east outlet anymore. First and last time.
5
I love their duck confit, crispy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside! Love how their salmon was well done too!
3
Have the christmas festive menu set.Appetizer: The chicken consommÃ© soup was clear and refreshing with chicken slices and mushrooms.Mains: The duck confit with truffle mash was delightful. The truffle mash was simply amazing.The lobster pasta was really disappointing as the lobster was stale and the pasta was not well-cooked.Dessert: Raspberry chocolate tart was acceptable. Pistachio panna cotta was surprisingly great with the enriching taste and texture of the pistachio
3
The staff was nice when I called in to postpone my reservation for half an hour, also when I was in the restaurant. It took me a while to locate the reataurant, because the address in Chope stated #06-00, but Far East Plaza actually only have 5 stories. Found it outside instead in the end. Not sure if it's because it was Friday night, it was so noisy in the restaurant, even though I went quite late around 9pm which was not peak hour. Brought my friend from Malaysia to try because I had a very good experience with my previous dine in Purvis St branch, but the food tastes quite disappointing this time honestly. The best I found was surprisingly the onion soup
4
Had mushroom soup (wonderful!!), truffle fries (ok for the price), duck confit (standard dropped), seabass (nice!) and add on whip potato with truffle (ok). Ambience was nice, price wise quite affordable. Shall come back again, but too disappointed with their famed duck confit, and wont have it again next time
2
Went to saveur (Far East) and was expecting something a bit more classy being a French restaurant. The food was very basic and mediocre and not presented well. I had the half baked chicken. The taste was fine but the vegetables looked very unappetizing. We added on the soup and drink for an additional amount and that was so so. Soup was cold and served in a cup and the portion too little.
4
Reservations was made using Chope and staff was helpful and friendly in redeeming Chope discount. Recommend the Angel hair pasta
3
try the saveur pasta! it's really cheap and good, altho this is the first time it felt average. the pasta wasn't as flavourful as usual, which was quite sad.
4
Really enjoyed dinner at Saveur Far East. The service was good and food was even better. had a good meal.
4
nice french food that won't hurt your wallet.. quite limited selection.. awesome creme brûlée.. small siting area thou
2
We patronises Saveur pretty regularly and the quality differs from every visits. Tried using the pre-purchased vouchers from Chope but was denied on public holiday, how disappointing.
4
Food is really good and most importantly, affordable! Better to make a reservation to secure a seat before heading down!
5
Service was good. Wait wasn't long and food was great tasting.
Had the duck confit and beef steak which were both cooked perfectly.
4
For the quality of the food, the prices are quite reasonable and does not really burn a hole in the pocket. A place one can go for french food for its affordability.
3
We went on a Friday evening, and whilst the food was really good, and authentically French that was about the only thing that was French, the atmosphere was very noisy, crowded and almost rushed. The value for money though is good, although the portions are a bit on the small side
4
Decided to try this after reading several good reviews, but mostly because I like popping candy desserts! So I dragged the family to try our this restaurant.We decided on the set meal which we felt was a good deal. Between the four of us, we tried the duck rillette, beef bourguignon, duck confit, foie gras and more. Of course I had a blast with the dessert that contained popping candy.Yes, we'll visit again. :
4
Foods taste good. Service was a tad bit slow and noisy probably due to the Saturday crowd. Reservation is simple.
4
Easy to make booking at this restaurant and pricing is reasonable. Staff attentiveness is good too. Only drawback is that it's packed and a tad noisy, but that's understandable :)
4
Lost count of which time I visited this place for dinner. Staff was quite flexible to amend their bill so that we may use the voucher purchased previously that was going to expire soon. Quality of food still up to standard as usual.
5
Food was excellent and value for money. Had the lunch set consisting of the pasta, duck confit and pistachio panna cotta and everything exceeded expectations. Will definitely return.
3
Service was slow even though there wasn't a lot of customers around but food was good. Will return on another occasion to try again and hopefully service is much better.
5
I love how you can get delicious food at Saveur and the standard of food is just as good as its sister restaurant at Saveur Art.
Even the staff's attentiveness are always on top form.
4
The food was great and of good value. However the service could have been much better. It was hard getting the attention of the service staff.
4
Pasta appitizer and crispy duck confit was quite tasty. Just a pitty that restaurant powered off twice while eating
3
We had picked savuer fareast for my sister's 60th birthday dinner. Restaurant was quite packed as it was a Friday nite. The whole dinner took almost 2hrs. Mostly waiting time as Service was slow. had to wait quite long for everyone (7 of us) to get our meals. Chicken came and was still raw inside. Had to wait for even longer to get a new one done. By then everyone had finished their meals. Anyhow we were given the impatient face when we asked for plates for the cake. And had to ask again for forks for the cake. I guess maybe we were not allow to bring outside food?? Won't go to this branch again
2
I've went to the saveur at cathay previously and had a better experience. However, at far east saveur, the service was really bad. First, I could not use my chope voucher on their set meal, which previously I was able to use at cathay outlet. Double standard. Secondly, I went at a non peak hour. The whole restaurant only consist of two tables of customer. But the food took more than 30 - 45 mins to arrive.Lastly, the duck confit was great as usual, but the chicken leg tagliatelle really doesn't taste good at all.
4
I love the duck confit from Saveur, and it's great that it's so affordable! The Far East outlet has the best food quality, but the restaurant had an odd smell on the day that we visited.
5
Great service, great food! Good for leisure & business. Must order - duck confit, saveur pasta & salmon confit (my new found love!)
3
Their food kind of selling fast.. i was thinking to order beef and salad for my dinner, but end up all sold out. ><
3
We visited there at 11:30am.it was opening time of restraint and staff were busy. So we couldn't order easily.
3
Love the food at Saveur, but service was really bad at this branch. Prefer Purvis and Cathay branch.
3
Weird foam dessert that was way too small, and a chocolate hazelnut dessert that was way too big; too sweet, too jelat after a few bites.
Their lower priced beef main was unavailable. Duck config was what I chose in the end. Pretty good.
4
Food was tasty and priced reasonably, but the restaurant was severely understaffed which led to long waiting time to be seated, orders to be placed and food to be served. The 2 waiters were just rushing around serving and doing cashier so they had to sometimes pretend not to see hands raised. That being said, the food tasted good though portions could have been bigger
4
French cuisine in Singapore is often synonymous with 'huge plates, tiny portions (at steep prices)'.Saveur clearly bucks the trend: good, affordable, unpretentious French food, made all the more affordable with regular promotions (like one free Saveur pasta per order of duck confit)!We had the duck confit, sea bass and chicken roulade from the a la carte menu - all delicious and just the right size for our average Singaporean appetites. If you fancy dessert, definitely go for the pistachio panna cotta.While previously it was strictly walk-in only, reservations can now be made via Chope. Will be back
4
With Chope app, we didn't have to queue and got seats at 6:30pm even when I choped for the 7pm slot. Thumbs up for their flexibility! :) Food was served pretty quickly and tasted well, albeit the service from one of the staff could be better. Overall great experience! :
5
Had a table of 8 for a company lunch and spent $160. With the duck confit offer with free Saveur pasta, the meal was awesome and tasty. Highly recommend the consistent standard of food at affordable price. God bless Saveur for honouring their faith in their work!
4
Just delightfull French food. The Salmon just melts in your mouth. Service was good and it's not very expensive.
4
Very easy to understand and use the app. Confirmation call/ reminder call will be made 1hr before reservation. Thumbs up CHOPE!
5
Had a delightful and wonderful dining experience.
Great French food at reasonable price!
Definitely will come back again!
4
Good & Affordable French Cuisine with attentive service. A number of Classic French dishes that you would pay a lot more elsewhere is almost at Street-Food prices. Wow!
4
Food is still great ! However, the portion for the pistachio Panna cotta became smaller. But still awesome !
4
Environment abit noisy and tables are close to each other. Food wise was up to standard and was understaffed.
3
If eating with friends for one of those uneventful occasions, this place will be ideal. Although the menu can be updated (run out of variety after 3 visits) to nice surprises for return visitors.
4
The food is nice ( duck confit and saveur pasta) but the service is bad. My starter just come after i almost finished my main course.
3
The chocolate hazelnut I doesn't like it. Overall the food is alright. The place should be more clean as I saw the dust just fly out from the light.
4
The salmom was cooked to nearly perfection and melts in your mouth. The tenderloin was also very tender. What blew us away was their signature lava cake which ooze out when we first attack the cake. We had a good time n will come back again.
4
The service staff was not entirely familiar with the promitions / discount with different credit cards. Caused us some confusion.
4
We tried the new menu oxtail beef, it was quite delicious with baked potato, carrot and mushroom. It was good recommendation from the waitress and look out for change of menu. Creme bule is also nice.
3
The atmosphere was okay. Food can be a tad bit saltier. Prefer the cathay branch more. Servers dont really smile.
5
Pretty nice food! Love the duck. Promotion set really value for money. Would definitely recommend and visit again.
5
Good is good and value for money but the table arrangement is to close with the next table to each other.
2
While the food was really affordable, it was apparent why that was so from the quality and the execution. The portions are pathetic (you could literally count the lentils). Just a heads up, they'll charge you $2 for a saucer of extra sauce. We had ordered a bottle of wine and we were expected to open and pour the wines ourselves. On top of that, one of the servers (who was responsible for dumping the wine and wine glasses) dumps the dishes on our outermost table and walked off leaving us to pass the plates around. Cheap but terrible place to dine
2
As my wife booked a table for 2, we reached early 30 mins. Table was prepared. Between tables was way too near each other and for guest was way to uncomfortable although owner would like to maximise profit putting maximum tables.Food was OK with reasonable price. Looking at service, service staff were struggling giving service. Only 1 Philillines guy o t he floor was attentive and the rest just need us to wave to bring out their attention.Overall, improving on service and additional manpower is a must to enhance service standard. The place seems overcrowded with tables and chairs. Floor plan need to revamp.
3
The 3-course set lunch at Saveur is known to be of good value, but the menu selection were rather rich and sweet instead of a little more balance.The saveur 's pasta with the tiny dried shrimps was an interesting appetiser but itself was quite fulfilling. The duck confit was a little burned outside though acceptable, the creamy rice served with chicken roulade was way too rich like butter rice! Both the creme brulee (also slightly burned at the top) and pistachioÂ panna cotta were sweet desserts but we would rather see a palate cleanser like Sorbet on the menu. Still a good meal otherwise but won't rate it a 4-star!The Far East Plaza location is much less crowded during lunch than Purvis with the same menu
3
The first time I went to the restaurant, it was alright because there was not much people, and me and my friend was served the meal course by course, which was what I was expecting when I went there the second time. But that was not the case. I actually left a comment if I could bring a birthday cake because it was my friend's birthday. There was no follow up, which I did not take it to heart. The day I went there, which was 2nd July 2016, I brought my cake which they did help to keep it in their fridge. However, the part that I was not happy with was the service. I understood that the restaurant was really busy. But our food was sort of rushed through. Before we even finished our appetiser, the main courses already arrived, which we were shocked and appalled as we thought it would be course by course. And we had the impression like we were supposed to quickly eat and leave as there were other patrons who needed the place to eat. There was nothing special that they did, and I thought with so many service staff, when I did tell them about the birthday dinner, they would at least sing a birthday song or something when they bring the cake. But no. The food was great, but the service can be improved. Will still give the place another shot, and it is only because of the food.
4
Salmon confit was great, duck salad okay, chicken okay, beef T not enjoy, butter served with it did not match...Service did not match the restaurant n the service charge, waiters so busy but not serve very well. Atmosphere disappointing, it's like a cafe, a bit noisy. The one at bugis is better in this way
4
price is the killer for frenchie food
saveur has managed that perfectly
been here few times..
cant go wrong with duck confit... foie gras.. escargot... pistachio
nomnomnom
3
It was my first time to have lunch at the restaurant.
The food I ordered was good, but it was just avarage: nothing special, I must say.
4
ordered 2 dinner set. Starter and main course is very nice and yummy. For the dessert a bit sweet and fatty. Overall, worthy to visit again
4
Standard drop, cleanest have to be more careful. I found a small piece of metal coil in my food. On the 6 June 16
5
Solid French food. In Singapore, you are usually talking $30 or more per entree. Here prices are around $15 and the food is very good. Their appetizer Saveur pasta is delicious at less than $5
4
The set lunch was decent and portions were good.
Love the desert.
Would be lovely if they can allow an upgrade to latte or cappuccino with the set,
3
Made a reservation for 7pm and arrived early. Was told there were no tables available and had to wait till 7.30pm to be seated. Unpleasant waiting experience and rather poor crowd management on their part. However, the food was great and somewhat made up for the initial disappointment
2
I've always been a fan of Saveur and I've got to say this is the worst branch. The lady on the phone could not find my reservation through Chope and had to repeat my name and details over and over again. The interior, especially the chairs are extremely run down and the food is mediocre at best. Would not recommend.
5
Overall the food was excellent. However was disappointed with the service staff. She cant even smile and say thank you. She has unwelcome look at her face all the time. Moreover , some of the staff was sleeping around when we eating dinner. The management should provide a better facilities for the staff
5
Booked a table for 6 at the restaurant. The entire experience was smooth. I was able to send reservation info to guests and got a reminder about the booking and a call to request for confirmation; all very efficiently done. The table was waiting when we arrived and the food was great. The best part, the price was really value for money for the great quality!
4
I enjoyed the Saveur pasta and the duck confit. Although the food can be less salty. The duck was cooked nicely, crispy outside and soft inside :) my Friend didn't enjoy it though😂
4
Reservation was easy and accurate, service to be improve for that outlet. Food was awesome, Always love their saveur pasta so much, but duck confit for that day is a little too salty.
5
I brought my friend there for the first time and I've been there several times, the service and food has always been excellent and it's really value for money for its quality
4
I really love the food there ! Love love the Pistachio Panna Cotta as well ! This is one place where I could get a decent pistachio dessert !
1
Used to have friendly and nice waitress, but this time I went all the they don't serve so well anymore. And they used to give free small piece of cake for customer celebrate birthday there, now no more also.
1
Here’s perhaps the main thing: Saveur, sadly, isn’t bringing much to the Singapore culinary conversation.The food was not only inedible but fraudulent. That duck confit is almost totally free of taste or character, taken from a deli in Anywhereville. They’re not meant for eating. With the dessert, you expected salted caramel lava cake and what you get instead is the dull texture and bland flavour of a wartime MRE. It tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde.Savuer might have the worst service of any Singapore restaurant. A “poor” rating with a “chaotic” atmosphere.It’s like we’re punishing ourselves for something. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
4
There were 5 of us including myself booked for dinner. We were pleased by the quality of food with the given price. However, the service was a little slow as due to the short of staff. Could be better if they are more attentive to guests though. Overall bill was reasonable.
5
Saveur serves delicious French food. My favorites are their frothy Mushroom Cappuccino Soup, pan-seared Foie Gras with Creamy Lentils, and crisp skinned Duck Confit. And my new favorite "starter" dish that's just been added to their menu is the mouth-watering Prawn Pasta. It's a capellini pasta with crispy Sakura Ebi, pieces of Tiger Prawns and caviar. The ambience and service may be average, but the food's definitely a winner
4
It has been a year plus after my last visit and with recent visit I can felt that Far East Plaza branch really have commitment to maintain their signature dish(duck confit) quality to the utmost...well done boys.Also trying some new dishes from appetizer which are also up to the good quality.
3
First time at Saveur Far East. Overall experience was average. The food were reasonably priced given the quality and presentation. However the restaurant was a little too noisy, with families n kids chatting n laughing lordly. Staff were friendly but they forgot one of my orders although the restaurant wasn't exactly crowded. Overall experience average.
