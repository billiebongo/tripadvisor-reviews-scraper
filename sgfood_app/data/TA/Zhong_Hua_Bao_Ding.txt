The restaurant open till midnight . It is so good for traveler to find the local food around the hotels at China town. I really love pork ears sliced with chili. It is so yummy!

We ate here whilst in Singapore our initial thoughts were that as it was full of locals the food should be good. We were not in the least disappointed. The food is freshly cooked and the portions are large, so don't order too much.The staff do not speak English so we pointed and got what we ordered so lots of smiles, they don't see too many English tourists I guess. Excellent food and inexpensive, we would revisit if we return to Singapore
