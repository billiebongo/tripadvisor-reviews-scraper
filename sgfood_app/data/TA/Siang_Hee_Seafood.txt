The last time I dined at Siang Hee, it was in a coffee shop in Zion Road. I had been there several times and always enjoyed the food, especially the the deep fried pork knuckle. The other dishes were very good too; the prawn paste deep friend chicken, the pumpkin prawns, and the hotplate tofu, the beef and bittergourd stir fry were delicious. And don't go past their vegetable dishes either as they are well done, cooked just right and very tasty.This visit was no exception. Everything was just right from the time I called to ask if a table of seven could be had. Being a hawker centre, the fixed tables and chairs only seat six but the stall stuck and table to one side and viola, enough space for seven or even eight.Not all of us arrived at the same time, but our order was taken with the proviso that the dishes would be cooked only after the last member of our party arrived. When then happened, the dishes came in short order. The food and rice were served very quickly. Good service was always a part of the Siang Hee experience.The deep fried pork knuckle was as good as I remembered it from several years back . The piquant sauce it came with is to die for. I know friends who ask for a container to take away. And it still cost $18. That's remarkable in an age when prices of many things continue to rise.Apart from a great meal, the cost for six dishes plus rice was just $95. That is very good value for money

Super in love with their Pumpkin Sauce with Butter Prawns that I just have to submit this as a listing. It's hawker style which is how most locals in Singapore eat. It's open air, fast-food type and self-service. It might not be much to look at first. But this stall has gotten note worthy accolades from local and international for their super tasty dishes. It's a bit far from the usual sites in Singapore, but if you're in the area. You cannot, should not miss it
