Food is so sedap (delicious) and tasty rempah. The restaurant venue is conveniently located at Esplanade and so visibly easily located near escalator. I had a nice window view and nice food. Portion is reasonably plated.
The service is acceptable but can be much better.

It's 50/50.
Need to be reminded on our orders too often.
No doubts foods are delicious.
The staffs are friendly.

Me and my husband decided to take our dinner here before we go for the concert. I reached here around 6pm, Friday. Not crowded.I ordered the nasi lemak with prawn, the taste is good, sambal is nice but the prawn not so fresh. Good service, nice environment.Overall is good, but a S$16 Nasi Lemak is a bit over price

I purchased the $78 for $100 worth of fb voucher. Came on a Saturday with my family.Restaurant is easily accessible and I liked the space in between tables. It is not too close. If you get a view overlooking Marina Bay, it is better.Unfortunatey three to four items were out of stock. And the portion is ittle. You would think $98 for three adults would be sufficient. right? Wrong

Food was a little higher than average. But really nothing special. Lobster nasi lemak was good but we ordered 6, they only had 4 left. Mutton rendang nasi lemak was not as good. Service was average. Other than the lobster nasi lemak, the other food was overpriced for their value and taste. Worth trying once only

Cosy and affordable place. We had the lamb shank rendang and potato ball soup. The lamb shank rendang was tasty but quite dry. The potato ball soup was perfect. The serving time was really quick and the staff was attentive. There wasn't many people around so the experience was great. The place can be spruced up a little bit more with lights at the corner as some spots can be a little bit dark.

Excellent service and delicious lobster nasi lemak and lamb shank nasi lemak.Best part is their fragrant smell of hot piping coconut rice. We even ask for 2nd helping of extra rice! Then their jumbo delicious satay and gravy.. Quick service,waiter and waitress was polite.Definitely will come again but this time will try out their other dishes.Glad that my husband review was,"It was totally a memorable birthday celebration with gd delicious foodies at Chef Wan's Kitchen and felt that it was a gd opening of the year 2018. Best reservation made sayang! I love it so much!"

Running out of options for our dinner after work on weekdays, we decided to drop by. Nice ambience, given table by window with a view, though next table perhaps better, nice proper cutlery and crockery. Limited menu but that’s ok. It was Thursday, and our first few choices were not available, so we settled for the Assam fish head and two rice, and coffee. When the food came, we were glad that our first few choices were not available; the serving was huge and the Assam fish head came with veggies too; tomatoes,etc though eggplants could be softer. Anything more generous, then dining would not be enjoyable. With coffee and one dessert, it came up to slightly more than what we would normally pay for dinner after work, but then, the ambience and decor made up for it, bar that rather riotous table of 8 or 9 that was having their company year-end event. Service could be better - my husband was served with soup spoon for his coffee -lol. We’d like to come back occasionally for dinner after work again, as the place beckons, but please don’t tell us that this and that are not available next time

Not much of choice...having difficulty finding the place for a 1st timer. Suggest to put up big signboard. Taste

Was reaching the restaurant about 5 mins to booking timing when I received a call from the restaurant stating that there would be more than 10 dishes unavailable. In the end we did not dine after finding out that most of the signature dishes weren't available. The restaurant wasn't a even 30% full, there should be ample preparation for Christmas day but it turned out to be a a disappointing visit. I now have wasted 700 chope points the change for the restaurant vouchers

Only the lamb shank rendang is very nice.
Service not that good. We need to ask for plain water.The price is quite expensive.
3
Items are rather pricey for the portion. Beef rendang and chicken dosh were rather tough and the baked cod fish didn’t smell too good.

I was supposed to have dinner gathering with my friends but unfortunately i was sick not able to attend, informed the restaurant staff Azmeer to assist in overlooking dinner, he was very patient & efficient.

I and my family having dinner at che wans kitchen at the first time , the food was great and delicious too and we will be back again there.

It was really a nice restaurant with the right ambience and nice delicious peranakan dishes whipped up for us

Had dinner with my sister a few nights ago. Total of 4 adults and 5 kids. We had the clear oxtail soup, sotong masak hitam, rendang, javanese fried chicken. The food was good especially the sotong but most of the dishes except for the soup was quite spicy. Might try asking for less spicy version next time. I would like to commend the staff for their exceptional service that night. With 5 kids, it would naturally be quite rowdy and noisy but at no point in time did the staff showed any displeasure. On top of that, they even served us a basket of fries complimentary while the rest of the dishes were being prepared. We were surprised at their attentiveness and were appreciative of this as it kept the children occupied and helped to settle them down. Thank you so much to the staff. I am sure Chef Wan would have been proud of you if he knows

Unbelievably bad.- poor service/attitude The places wasn't crowded but they still made us wait outside e restaurant. All their staff were trading glances with unhappy faces, apparently waiting for someone to attend to us.. finally 1 came after 10 mins to bring us to our table.Throughout the dinner ordeal, no one bothered to top us our drinks, when requested, they finally hand us a jug of water.- Lack of business professionalism Gave us a list of unavailable items printed on a piece of A4 paper along with the menu.. basically almost 80% of the food items were unavailable! Even so, after making our orders, they still mentioned that the item is unavailable! (What? On top of your already long list of unavailable items?) We assumed that they were juz lazy to make the ayam percik, instead they improvised a dish by juz slapping the green chilli belado sauce on a grilled chicken ( literally improvised! Not on menu)They didn't even have gravy dishes that was on the available menu! - quality of dishes With a top celebrity chef as the face of the restaurant, you'd at least expect some decent quality dishes. But instead the dishes served was nothing out of the ordinary which you can find in hawker stalls selling nasi padang in your heartlands! I am one who has low expectations when i dine but this restaurant juz surprised me! If you open a business, at least have some pride in your business. From this experience i have, it seems like this place is destined to be doomed. Definitely my one and only visit to this restaurant

Chance upon this new restaurant when taking a scroll at esplanade. Hop on it to give it a try and glad I did! One of the best halal food I had. Ordered some signatures of the restaurant like Beef Rendang, Tahu Telur, Oxtail Soup and Wing Beans! Good for 2! My favourite would have to be the Tahu Telur, keeps going back for more helpings! The beef rendang is also superb - meat was tender and juicy, taste was just right for me! Another dish that I love is the oxtail soup. Big fan of oxtail soup but not many places serve good ones! So happy they have this dish at Chef Wanâ€™s Kitchen! Restaurant is brightly lighted with a nice view! Would recommend this restaurant definitely!

Spanish chicken stew bland, mee soto salty and not worth the price given the quality of the condiments that came with it. I could get a better bowl at a hawker center.Yellow rice arrived cold, and for the price paid, they could have at least garnished it! Service staff was not attentive

We decided to try this restaurant after my daughter's recital. Good was good.. We had the sending, fried java chicken , French beans and oxtail soup. We were a party of four and there was more than enoughGreat taste and full of flavour. We were not disappointed

The yellow coconut rice & Beef rendang was too dry. But the cod fish was delicious.
Love the ambience.
4
Overall service was above average, and waiting time was reasonable.
We will return to try other dishes.
2
Average over priced food with a very misleading deal from chope. I think you can get better and cheaper food elsewhere
5
The portion of the food was reasonable. Service was great with knowledgeable staff and the food was delicious as well. Would recommend those who are craving for malay dish.

We were treated to a flavourful and sumptuous lunch of well balanced spiced dishes.As part of a 3 course set, our chosen mains - Ayam Percik, Javanese Fried Chicken and Fish Belado - went perfectly well with Yellow Coconut Rice, Urap Carrot & Cucumber, Sambal Goreng, Sambal Egg and Emping..We washed down our meal with refreshing Calamansi, Lemongrass and Bandung..Desserts were Durian Custard and Steamed Jackfruit Custard, ending our lunch on a perfect note.Kudos to Chef Wan and staff, for a pleasurable gastronomic experience..We shall return soon to sample other Asian and international dishes

I visited this restaurant after booking through chope, stating that I am going for the promotion set. When I reach and ordered the set meal, I was told that the details stated on the chope website was erroneously written to be half the actual price of the meal. The restaurant manager even explained that the mistake had already been reflected by customers who dined with them before that. I am rather unsatisfied with the advertorial mistake and also the failure of the restaurant to rectify their mistake. They should have viewed my remarks and called me in advance to alert me on the misrepresentation made. The restaurant was un-contactable too.I had made quite a few calls but no one picked up during both their business hours and afternoon break hours

My friends and I ate the Tom Yam Pumpkin Crabmeat soup, Mee Goreng and Lontong. The image, hygiene, aroma and taste were worldclass. However, I just wished the lady who served us had put up more smiles and given us a warm, welcoming feeling. My friends and I loved the view. We took lots of pictures and posted on Instagram. I would also like to thank the staff for helping to keep my bag with my belongings safe when I had to leave the restaurant for a brief moment to pick up an urgent call. They returned my bag when I returned and all my belongings were intact. Thanks for the goodwill, Chef Wan's Kitchen!

The place is inside of esplane next to rafles mall, very cozy place and the service was good, great welcome from waiter, very recommended of the rendang and briani rice very authentic and delicious, recommended for anyone who want to enjoy the asian foods also the place is good for romantic dining or family dinin

Tried the mee rebus but was disappointed. It tasted no different from the ones you can find at any hawker centre or coffee shop. Nothing outstanding, just plain average and bland. Certainly a great disservice to Chef Wan's name and reputation. And it's mind blowing when someone commented the mee rebus should be named mee bagus. Perhaps i'm just unlucky.

Brought my family of 4 here for dinner we ordered the Grilled Chicken spicy gravy, Chef Wan Javanese chicken, oxtail soup and Beehoon chicken soto. Dishes that were our fav are - The oxtail soup was soooo yummy, brought bk memories of my grandma homecooked meal. Next were the grilled chicken w spicy gravy, to us who love spicy food this is not spicy but the grilled chicken is really tender and acc w d gravy it really brings out the flavour! Lastly the javanese chicken, the fried chicken was really tender not oily and at first glance u would think the acc gravy was the same as the spicy gravy but its not...the diff spices really makes this dish stands on its own. The other dishes are normal but the above are those that stands out. Love the view and space as well, I would consider on holding a corporate event w them.
