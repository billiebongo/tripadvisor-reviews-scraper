I come here whenever I miss eating the Japanese omu-rice (A Japanese dish combining omelette + rice + sauce). It's really authentic! The stewed brown sauce version w beef, is my fav !!

Ya tea n soup are free flow n self service..... Probably this is the only place to find authentic Japanese omelette rice in Singapore.

We had all arrived in Singapore that morning and were wandering around looking for somewhere to eat. We chanced upon Pecori and were very glad we stopped. The main meals were great value and include tea, water and salad bar. I had prawns and teriyaki chicken with rice. The tonkatsu looked good too. My meal was SGD12.80 - bargain

There's a variety of omu rice to choose from, with demi sauce, tomato sauce and a mentaiko cream sauce. The omu rice are okay, but what surprised us was the free flow of salad, french fries, pasta, soup, coffee and tea that came with our omu rice during happy hour. That probably made our meal more exciting

Tried this Japanese shop tucked in a corner of Liang Court. While the shop is small it does serves a surprisingly reasonable variety of food from the omelette rice with either Demi (brown gravy sauce) or tomato sauce. In addition there are other dishes priced at $9.8 or sets from $12.8. We also had French fries and could choose from a wide selection of "topping" powder, we eventually chose the relatively tame soya sauce n butter which was almost finger licking good.

I have been visiting Liang Court for years, never once that I could understand why they are often so many people dining at this place. Imagine a plate has an omelette egg with some unhealthy deep fried meats that comes along with some thick orange or red sauce added all over it? Looks either weird or too heavy to me.That was my thought until I saw an online promotion. Then I was telling myself ok maybe this is the time that I should give them a shot.Oh tell you what, I have regretted my initial thought about Pecori Japanese Egg Restaurant after my first dining experience. What did I have? Of course the rice with the super smooth egg, the tomato based sauce covered the entire plate with two deep fried fish placed on top along with some bacon and mushrooms. Pretty decent or rather a big portion. The sauce was so good that I nearly cleaned up the entire plate. Besides we also ordered another plate that comes with shrimps and curry based. Honestly this one is very filling after just few bites. Maybe because it was curry.In addition, for any meal that you ordered. They offered free flow of:mixed salad, potato, soap, pasta, coffee and and and .... the pudding to die for. I can finish the entire plate, but of course I didn't.They have opened another branch in Chinatown Point for a while, it's a perfect place for family dining too. Their plastic ware were quite cute. Bring kids along, I am sure they will sure enjoy the experience especially the free flow d.i.y section

Very average and don't find the dinner to be worth. Not much varieties of salad and soup don't taste like miss. The soup is bean spout soup tasteless. Only one dessert and not nice. The free coffee is not hot... cold cold... but the mash potatoes is nice
