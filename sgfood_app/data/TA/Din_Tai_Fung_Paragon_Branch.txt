Bad service!
Service staffs only interested to talk among themselves.
The branch manager only interested to serve Yusheng and Caucasians.
Food is good but the waitresses service is far lacking!!!!
5
A great local food eating option! We were briefly visiting Singapore on a business trip and visited Din Tai Fung after finding online recommendations good. We were not disappointed! Good efficient service and great value for money.

Best dim sum in Singapore. The staff is very friendly and the food is so good, I went at least 10 times in 8 months and it‚Äôs always delicious. Don‚Äôt miss it!
5
I really enjoy my dinner ah DTF. It costs us 100SGD for 4 persons. Most probably you will have to queue to have a table. but it worths it.
4
There are a number of these restaurants in Singapore serving traditional dumplings, fried rice, noodles and lots of other oriental delicacies. Nice menu, good food tasty and well cooked, very clean and pleasant restaurant. Recommend for the food and reasonable prices

Encouraged to dine here by my son who loves going with his friends, i possibly made the mistake of going at CNY.We had to wait 45 minutes outside to get a table before being served in a hurried, inhospitable manner. Yes, the food is delicious but its the way its served that is so off-putting. Not a smile in sight. Maybe need to try again at a quieter time of year (though my son says he always needs to wait)
4
Went to this place after hearing about it so much from friends - true to its reputation, by far one of the best dimsum experiences I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve had. Some may find the pricing higher than expected but it was worth it. Had to wait in line for quite some time, I guess this is the kind of place which deserves waiting in line for - so prepare accordingly. The food menu is like a form - select what you want, pay and someone will bring it to your table.
5
We have been Din Tai Fung more times than I can remember. Food is always excellent. Our usual dishes include the yummy appetiser salad dish, hot and sour soup, xiaolongbao, pork chop with rice, veggie. It never goes wrong with them.Their noodles are good too if it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s what you are after. However, I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t find their buns great. The skin for me is a bit too thin and it doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t have that chewy and fluffy texture that a bao needs. Overall, Din Tai Fung is our to go place for an easy and quick lunch fix.
5
Our favorite restaurant never disappoint us..always keep coming back for fried rice and dumpling and ofcourse the main reason for our craving in this restaurant is the oriental salad w/special vinegar dressing. Whenever we have a visitor this is one of the restaurant must them to try.Always satisfied costumerGreat valueGreat service fast and sufficient.
4
Arrived with a group of 5 on a Monday evening only a 5 minute queue which was excellent. Service was prompt and effective, minor issue in that the server didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t tell us the green chillis were sold out. Food is fantastic and prices are very reasonable. Enjoy the spectacle watching the cooks prepare and steam the food. Always an excellent place for dinner
5
Nice concept and excellent food. Everything is made fresh on the spot and all the dishes we tried were excellent
5
Din Tai Fung is consistent wherever you have it and the Paragon branch is no exception. Absolute favourite dumplings.
4
My favorite dishes are the oriental salad as appetizer and the pork chop fried rice as main, and it is still as good as the last time. However noticed that waiting staff were slower to replenish drinks.
5
Been to most of their branches. Food and services are consistent and never fail to disappoint. First discovered them in Taipei (where they came from) back in the early 70s. A must visit whenever I am in Taipei.
5
Simply Oh My Goooood! If you guys have never tried din tai fung before its a must eat in Singapore, malaysia or thailand! Taiwanese Franchise is best known for this super flavored xiao Long Bao dumpling! But whatever you decide to order from the menu is exquisite! If its your first timeI would personally recommend these:1. Original pork xiao long bao2. Dry noodle in special sauce3. Prawn egg fried rice4. Chicken or pork ribs herbal soup5. Dou miao vegetable6. Hot and sour soup for those who like spicy 7. Dumplings in black vinegar sauce8. Taro bao pao if still available.I always give DTF a 5 star rating! Bon apetit
2
Friend of a friend was like this is world famous and people come here just for these dumplings. lol they are not good. Actually they were gross. This is food court food. They got the order wrong, service was good though and they tried to fix fast. I left without finishing the food and went somewhere else
5
This restaurant was recommended by a Balinese restauranteur. We eagerly came and we were not disappointed. We arrived late on a Sunday night (8:30) and the restaurant was very busy but we did not have to wait. We ordered about 34 pieces for us and our 3 kids which we felt would√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been plenty however the dumplings were so enjoyed we ordered 6 more. Loved the steamed pork dumplings so much! Free flow jasmine tea completed our meal. The service was fast and efficient and we even watched them make the dumplings from the kitchen which is displayed for all to see. Kitchen is spotless and so was the restaurant. Prices were very reasonable and everyone felt it was our best meal in Singapore so far. Def try this place
4
Whatever Din Tai Fung branch we go, we always have to wait some 20mins for a table. During the waiting time, you may fill out your orders, fried rice, dan dan mian, vegetable/mushroom dumplings, fried dou miao veggies w garlic, noodles with huntun and pokka jasmine iced tea are a fantastic culinary journey. Always a great experience, despite the waiting
5
There are a number of these restaurants scattered around. We loved the dumplings, fried rice, the noodles. In fact we liked everything on the menu. Food is consistently good, the kitchen staff wear masks & gloves & the restaurants are very clean & pleasant. It gets busy at lunch & dinner times - you need to queue up at times. Highly recommend the food & its reasonably priced
3
It's always a long Q at all Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore during lunch & dinner.The popular Xiao Long Bao is good. The pricing is reasonable. But during peak hours, we practically got to swallow the food. The servers are quick to clear the tables, asking you to leave indirectly due to the long Q.So, it is not a good place to savor the food & gathering, sit down and talk over the table
4
Pretty crowded at noon, but no long waiting time. Noodle soup with beef and the dumpings were tasty, payment by cashier when leaving.
4
Regular stop during our visits to Singapore. You can‚Äôt go wrong here. The pork and crab bun, spicy noodles and the wonton noodles with the vinegar and chilli sauce exceptional. Whatever you do leave space for the heavenly mango pudding
4
Had a lunch, steamed crab and pork dumplings are excellent. Tofu is great! We need to order additional. Fried rice with shrimp is good but a little oily. Service is fast.
5
The vegetarian suggestions, without oil, include: vegetarian dumplings, mushroom dumplings, fungus salad and bitter gourd in bean sauce. The waiting time is generally short as the restaurant is very big with many open seats.
4
The best egg fried rice, smell so good and it is not oily. If you like sour food, should try the sour&spicy noodle too. The cold dishes üëç
4
One of the best Ding Tai Fung in town! Servings were quick, have kids set so your kids can also enjoy their meals!
5
Honestly you cannot go wrong with Din Tai Fung. No matter what country you visit them in, they consistently deliver high quality delicious dumplings. We ate here twice during our week in Singapore and I couldn't fault them. There may be a bit of a wait but they get through masses very quickly so be sure to wait if you can. It's worth it!
4
This restaurant in the basement of the very up market Paragon Centre is huge and looks to be busy all day long. My Singaporean friend ordered for us, hot and sour soup, egg fried rice, prawns with green sprouts, prawn strips and steamed pork dumplings, all delivered piping hot and utterly delicious. Perhaps the rice was a little oily, but that's being picky. Total bill around sing$63 in this highly recommended world wide chain
3
If comparing all SG branch. another alternative should be MBS branch.Will say that is much better.For ppl that travel all the way to orchard , please eat something eat. LOLok joke aside, yes this is a oversea chain store doing good for their dim sum food.But ranking top at sg restaurant is quite a sad thing for us Singaporean.This is not even food related to our culture and past . But well for the middle class locals it is a not bad reasonable price resturant when I can't afford better fine dinning and trying to find decent place for famil

Dined in 19 November 2017 at 14:10 PM. After waiting 20 minutes , found a table and ordered food. 20 minutes later a server approached and said it will take another 30 minutes because the mise en place is finished. I told them it didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t sound alright and I wanted to leave. Then manager approached us, extended apology, explained the situation and offered alternative. At the end he made it a win win situation by him offering not all the food but some of them and we accepted and in the end we left the place with somehow full stomach and not absolutely empty. Excellent food as always
5
Must visit for all visitors. Their dumplings are to die for. They actually have chicken soup inside the dumplings.
5
Ive been a international fan of Din Tai Fung for many years. What I love in singapore is the chilli crab version. I heard its also a favorite even for locals
5
You must visit a branch of Din Tai Fung whilst in Singapore, as a resident we go at least once a month and it never disappoints. Lunch and dinner times you will typically queue about 20 minutes for a table but it‚Äôs well worth it!
5
It‚Äôs a dumpling chain with many restaurants around Singapore! Simply delicious dumplings, the best ever! It totattly worth the line and waiting a bit!
5
When in Singapore, I always have lunch here on the first day and it never lets me down. Simply brilliant dumplings with fast service and a clean restaurant. incredible quality for an international chain.
5
Dumplings are to die for. The fried rice is also highly recommended. Great service and staff. Nice ambience and not too tight. Maybe a table near the kitchen would be good to watch the chefs at work
4
We had lunch here and ordered the shrimp and pork dumplings, some noodles, pork fried rice, some bao, all delicious and filling. Service was good and friendly. A good choice of place for lunch.
5
If you are a vegetarian and crave for Chinese food and don't want to go in for the 'mock' veg variety ....and IF you want authentic Taiwanese food....head for a Din Tai Fung branch in Singapore. With their presence in most of the main malls in the city/country, the menu is the same...and most of the times... the food too is the same...barring a few times when it tasted 'a bit different' in a particular branch. Our veg order comprises of (1)veg dumplings which are marvelous - don't let the green of the dough bother you- they are good! (2) the yam dumplings... again, a delight, (3)stir fried kailan and also (4) spinach in garlic. There is a bean curd dish as well and the yam buns which you shouldn't miss if you have a (low to average) sweet tooth. The finely shredded ginger is wonderful accompaniment with your order and I dunk some of it in the piping hot tea they serve.The staff is extremely efficient and friendly, sometimes language is an issue and as far as cleanliness goes....its a big thumbs up.Some handy tips while dining at DTF1. make it clear to the waitress that you are vegetarian and that all dishes are vegetarian2. Don't reach out for the red sauce/pickle on the table...its shrimp!3. ask for red chilies if you want to add extra zing to your meal ...its wonderful with the ginger and soy sauce. 4. Be very careful of what you tick on the order paper.....its in fine prin
5
So let's make this easy: Get the xiaolongbao if you've never had it before. Don't worry if you can't pronounce it or spell it. Just get it. It is a melt-in-your-mouth, flavor bomb that will make you want to come back for more. Also, make sure you follow the instruction sheet on how to prepare/eat the xiaolongbao. Don't just dig in. The mixing and prepping is all part of the experience and is a lot fun
5
This is our third visit to Singapore this year and among the highlights are visits to one or other of the Din Tai Fung restaurants. The food is terrific, so fresh, so tasty. Service is always efficient and friendly. A most do for our visits to Singapore
5
Excellent food and even better service. That was the best so far branch of dtf we have visited.
Staff was very quick and attentive. Food came quickly despite a busy time.
Very clean and neat.
5
Always consistent and delicious. First time to this branch. Get here before 11 am to beat the weekend rush. And, of course, get the xiao long bao.
4
Known for it's xiao long bao (steamed dumpling) and fried rice with pork chops. A great find for Chinese food.
5
Family friendly restaurant. Very good dumplings. I have brought family and friends from Europe. Never disappointed !!!
2
The standard of this restaurant has been dropping since last year. It used to be my preferred Din Tai Fung restaurant in Singapore, but the taste of its signature dumpling, chicken soup and chinese salade are not longer tasty. I am not sure of the reason but I think it is now a over rated and over priced restaurant.
3
They bring you water without asking it‚Äôs just room temperature tap water and of course you assume it‚Äôs free like every other restaurant on the planet but then they charge you a dollar for ‚Äúcold water‚Äù. I questioned the charge but they refused to remove it and of course they have one person on the till for a full restaurant so you are not gonna hold everyone up to dispute $2. But that‚Äôs $2 on a $50 bill meaning they just skimmed 4% for nothing! They are probably doing this at every table because everyone else had water too! Food is decent though but don‚Äôt let them pull the water scam
5
We have tried Din Tai Fung at Marina Bay Sands and in Melbourne (Australia) and it is consistently very good. We had a short (less than 15 min) wait for a table for dinner. Service is efficient without being rude. The soup dumplings remain a highlight but we also enjoyed some other varieties of dumpling, spinach and egg fried rice. The lemongrass juice was delicious and refreshing. It's pricey compared to hawker centres but it's a different kind of experience. Highly recommended
1
Din Tai Fung is the place to go anywhere in the world for good xiao long bao and pork chip fried rice, it's always good and the service is crisp. Except in Singapore. If you have had the pleasure of eating at din tai fung in Taiwan, HK and sydney - live on the memory. Singapore is terrible for the following reasons. 1. The dishes have been bastardised to sort of look and sound like the real thing - but they are poor poor replicas. The garlic cucumber is the most disgraceful example. 2. Servings. These are small dishes, they reflect an attitude of cheapness that ripples through the quality of the food3. Service. I get it... the wait staff don't like their job, they are understaffed and the clients are un-happy. But, really take that up with your boss - or leave it in the kitchen. Your clients can't do anything about your conditions and your dark attitude makes an already terrible experience worse Recommendations -------------------Don't do itThe restaurant on orchard is within the food republic, and there are literally lots of other better quality happier places to g

This is one of the less crowded outlets of the chain, with nice ambience. The prawn pancake, deep fried yam spring roll and chicken soup were outstanding. We also liked the crab and pork dumplings (but on hindsight the pork dumplings would have a more distinct taste). Chinese spinach, and pork/prawn and egg fried rice. The Claypot Sanpei chicken was a little disappointing. Service was good and waiting time for the food was short. At about $45 net per person, it was pretty good value.
5
I have visited several branches of Din Tai Fung in South East Asia. So whenever I come across one, it doesn't need much coaxing for me to go treat myself to their amazing soup dumplings. The service is quick and the food is fabulous. It is a great place for a quick meal
5
Once in a lifetime one must have truffleinfused Xiao Long Bao dumplings at Din Tai Fung. If you're a first timer they will give you a brochure showing how to eat. Go there!
4
I visit this restaurant with my granddaughters every time that I am in Singapore. We claim that it is because the girls enjoy it so much, but if I am honest, it is because we adults enjoy it more. The food is absolutely excellent, full of subtle tastes and Eastern magic. The service is quick and efficient, if just a little soulless, but the overall product is worth the annual visit every tim
5
I don't eat pork but now that there are chicken dumplings there is nothing holding me back. A solo lunch of the special salad with vinegar dressing and an order of chicken dumplings -- perfect size lunch and always excellent (and good value). I am not wild about the drink choices, no other complaints. I have been here so often I should be embarrassed, but I'm not.
5
We had a bit of a wait to be seated but it was worth it. Food was really good and the service was equally slick and they didn't rush us through. For a chain of restaurants, the quality is exceptional - please come to London with a branch
5
It is always great to dine here and have that Xiao Long Bao. Though the cost is on the mid range, it is all worth it. Also try the fried rice and noodles. I personally like the beef noodles. Once you tried their food, you would keep coming back. You would need to queue for sure during peak hours. Everybody is eyeing that Xiao Long Bao. The longest time we waited for one is 30 minutes. But still worth it
5
Consistently excellent food. My favorites are the classic pork dumplings and the black sesame buns. No reservations, just pick a number. Dinner on Fridays and Saturdays with long lines and waiting time up to 45 minutes. However, in the meantime you get to choose items from the menu and/or watch the staff prepare the dumplings. All done by hand but with extreme efficiency. Very fascinating.This and the branch at Raffles City I liked the best in regards to service and friendliness. The branch at Centrepoint charged me 5 Sing for a pot of tea (vs. 1 Sing with free refills at the other branches). They were not able to provide me with a logical reason why this was handled differently, so I did not return to this place.Overall, this chain is a very popular one, also among locals. Highly recommend it.
4
My cousin took me to the main branch of this restaurant the last time I visited Singapore, which I enjoyed very much. As such, I was excited to learn that there was another branch close to the hotel where I was staying, and I went there for dinner. I ordered their signature xiaolongbao, along with the prawn pancake and a bottle of beer. The xiaolongbao was just like the last time, steaming hot with delicious soup filling my mouth with every bite. The pancake was also delicious. Excellent food, with my only criticism being the relatively high price
4
A must have on any / every trip to Singapore or Taipei (first location), Din Tai Fung is renowned for its soup dumplings (xiao lung bao/xlb) which are scratch made on site in the kitchen (the creation can be viewed from exterior - see pics). The dumplings (all variety) are delicious and highly addictive - something I can't stop eating once I've started. Also great Shanghai style fish, drunken chicken, rice, beef soup, bamboo, etc. As in Taipei, this is located in a mall; but, unlike Taipei, not too much of a line (though I understand we were lucky). Casual, lunch time crowd, lots of buzz, fun
3
Went there to try its specialty siew loong pau.We also ordered its siew mai .Both came in large trays.The siew loong pau was just average unlike the ones we ate in Taipeh.The only difference between the siew mai and the siew loong pau is a small shrimp on top.The shrimp has no taste at all and the flour of the "bag" containing the meat is thick.Avoid the siew mai if you order the siew loong pau.There are many other dishes which look great.Staff service was good
5
We have visited many Din Tai Fung restaurants in Asia, and the one at Paragon is the best. You will not be disappointed with the pork Xiao Long Bao dumplings. They are filled with pork and a delicious broth that will keep you wanting more. Some of our favorite dishes are the do miao, the spicy dumplings in chili oil, and for dessert, the black sesame buns. Every dish we've tried has been a winner
4
The Shanghainess pork dumplings are really great. Lot of dishes to select at reasonable prices. Overall service are good and staff are friendly and courteous.
5
I've eaten at Din Tai Fung in three countries now and the food is consistently delightful every time! Chili crab dumplings were a fun surprise
4
Dumplings were very good especially the truffle dumpling! Though it's a little pricey - like 5 SGD each!
5
A large restaurant very crowded and yet efficiently handled in terms of service. The food was very hot and delicious. Enjoyed the flavours and would recommend it for a good Chinese food experience
3
The dumplings are excellent with the gingers slices! My personal fav. is the delicious noodles with chicken. Good to avoid the Saturday night crowds.
4
DTF is dumplings. Service is quick and delicious food. A good option for when you are craving dumplings!
5
"Din Thai Fung" restaurant at the basement level of Paragon Shopping Center serves delicious Shanghai style soup dumplings (Xiaolongbao) along with other delicious foods. My favorite dishes are pork dumplings, pork & shrimp dumplings, and shrimp fried rice. But there are many other dumplings and food items offered by the restaurant would be delicious to other patrons. Service level of the restaurant's staff members is high. The foods at this restaurant are reasonably priced, and standard credit cards are accepted. Combination of delicious dumplings and reasonable prices result in long waiting lines at the restaurant during the meal times. You should be at the restaurant well before or after meal times to avoid the long waits. If your waiting time is quite long after you sign in at the restaurant, submit your completed order slip to the hostess desk and walk around Paragon Center shops before returning to the restaurant well in time. You can also let the hostess know that you would be willing to share the table with other patrons to shorten the wait time. I would highly recommend this restaurant at Singapore's Paragon Shopping Center which is across Takashimaya Department Store on Orchard Road
4
A very busy restaurant chain which only takes reservations for eight people or more. This one we visited was located at the Paragon Centre on Orchard Road. Service was 'firm' bordering on a little rude and service was slower than our last visit both due to it being very busy. Food was good.
5
This is my fav restaurant in the whole world :)I have been frequenting this place since the past 2+ years now .. If you have never eaten dimsums , you will need to develop a taste for it .. So 3 visits down , I started to love this place .. And now I crave for it .. We go there every Sunday We like Paragon branch .. They have 10+ branches all across Singapore but this one is the flagship branch .. We are vegetarians so we don't have a wide range of dimsums .. Must order their vegetarian steam dumpling & dip it in the chilli patty + soy sauce .. Also egg fried rice is tasty & so is veg spring roll .. The jasmine tea unlimited refills go well with the dimsums .. Other nice items are boiled spinach with garlic , carrot juice , red bean dumplings (sweeter) , mushroom dumplings for vegetarians Peak time waiting is about 20+ mins .. Staff is friendly & mostly smiling .. Prices are mid-rang
3
Went to the Paragon after viewing the reviews but was very disappointed. The famous Xiao lung bao was nothing similar to that from their Taipei counterparts or worse than other international branch. Other dishes were just average. After waiting for 30 minutes in the queue, I was put off when told that I had only 90 minutes to have my meal
5
Anywhere I travel and there is a branch I have to visit. the food is unbelievably tasty and fresh. if you didn't try it is a must!
5
Fantastic, very fresh and very tasty dumplings. Highly recommended. You can see through the kitchen window how the dumplings are prepared. The "spicy & sour soup", the "oriental wanton" and the "porc & truffle dumplings" were very truly amazing. Very good price/quality relationship.
5
For a Dim Sum experience without spending lots of money you can't beat this restaurant. You order while waiting for your table and it took about 20mins to get seated. Food came out as soon as we sat down. Great fun and great food.
5
Me and my family love to go to Din Tai Fun during the weekends together .The food is awesome!!!The food me and my Sister like the best is Fried wanton.
4
A taste of Chinese cuisine. Food is good at fare price. Staff are attentive. Place is nice. We had a pleasant dinning experience.
1
Is this the same shop I ate in tea in Taiwan?
The dumplings is tasteless. The pork fired rice the park was dry . Bad
5
There's almost always a queue to get a table but the wait is so worth it. Service is above average, food is amazing. Their quality control definitely shows in the food, every time you go it's pretty much the same standard of excellence.
5
First of all, the service here is great. The staff is attentive and take good care of you.
The food is also great. Their dumplings are simply amazing.
4
Service was a bit awkward, slow and not sharp but the food was definitely great.Wide selection of dumplings, fresh, tasty and juicy.Great soup, nice fried rice with prawns, and an interesting sesame bun for dessert.A good experience indeed at a cheap price.A must try
5
This is a must stop for us when in Singapore. They open at 11 am on weekdays and 10 am on weekends and the place fills up quickly - it's not hard to see why. The xiao long bao comes in many different varieties and is delicious. But they also have a myriad of other dishes including different combinations of fried rice (we like it either with shrimp or with pork chop), Chinese soups boiled to a perfection (pork rib, chicken, etc), stir-fried veggies perfumed with garlic including dou miao and nai bai, cold starters including a delicious bitter melon subtly seasoned with black beans,and Shanghainese drunken chicken. The menu goes on and on with all kinds of noodles, wontons, fried tofu, fried savory pancakes, etc. There is hot tea service, the charge for which is waived if you order another beverage like one of our favorites, iced (literally with an ice orb inside a tall glass) of lemongrass or roselle (known as sorrel in the Caribbean, flor de jamaica in Mexico, and dok krachiap in Thailand). All around the restaurant you see a whole world of different nationalities enjoying their meal, both locals and visiting tourists. Service is excellent - Din Tai Fung definitely knows how to train their staff. Highly recommende
4
Catching-up with our visitors from US and HK here, we enjoyed the food, especially the dumplings and friend rice. The service is fast and decent for a dinner crowd on weekend.
4
Must try the Xiao Long Bao and Ramen and X.O Fried rice at Din Tai Feng. It's very delicious and worth for the Long Q.
5
Had the best hot and sour soup ever!
Cucumber appetizer was delicious also. I plan on going back to try other stuff on the menu.
5
The food is amazing to die for. I would like to go to this place every time i visit Singapore. A must visit place for all those who go to Singapore.
5
We arrived late but were politely shown to a table and told we had had plenty of time to order even though last orders were looming.With a few suggestions from our waitress we ordered a mixture of dumplings and noodle dishes. The service was prompt but friendly; once the food arrived it was obviously that they only use quality ingredients, the flavours were outstanding. Stuffed green chillies were superb. Brilliant restaurant with great visuals of the kitchens, worthy recommendation
5
Came here after several recommendations. Lived up to my high expectations. I love dumplings of all kinds, and there were many here to choose from. The Chicken soup dumplings were amazing. It is not cheap (especially the beers) but well worth the expense. I will come back here again for sure
4
This restaurant chain has branches all over Singapore but this outlet remains our favorite. We pay a visit every time we pass through Singapore and never leave disappointed. The Xiao Long Bao dough was thin and bagged a delicious mouthful of pork broth and juicy mince pork filling. The Jiaozi served up an equally thin dough wrapped around minced pork and vegetables.We also enjoyed the flat slab of deep-fried minced prawn cake. The lava bun was also a winner with fluffy dough enclosing a salty and sweet semi liquid egg yolk core.Service was attentive and tea was refilled regularly. Food also arrived within reasonable time.
4
The xiao long baos are definitely made to perfection - you can count the number of exact folds in each one. The sliced beef appetizer and fried rice with shrimp & eggs were just standard fare. The steamed vegetable & pork dumplings very tasty. Get here early or expect a wait; fills up fast. On the pricey side, but they have the reputation
5
A must stop restaurant for lunch or dinner...! This is a 1 hat restaurant, originated from Taiwan, and serves the best dumplings in town... and probably in the world. There are branches a bit everywhere actually, which we did not know. But in Singapore you can enjoy a feast for only $20 per person... costs double to triple that in Sydney as an example.Be mindful that there is always a queue at the front..usually goes pretty quickly. But you also may have to wait for food once you are seated on busy days, like was the case for us. Definitely worth the wait though
3
We visited on a friday night at 8.15pm, they gave us a number, the menu to pre order and we waited until our number was called on the screen (about 10min).The place is huge, has a mindblowing efficiency between waiters, table organizers, staff from kitchen. Completely professional operation in terms waiters looking around, they would say how long the order would take, and bring the bill to the table after ordering (before the food).We had vegetarian dumplings and buns, along pork with some veggies. We were not blown away by it at all, yet the price was steep.Very interesting place to visit, specially if you enjoy organization and systems, but did not love the food
5
The wait is long 90% of the time but it is worth it. My favourite DTF in the city. Love the dry noodles in special sauce, spicy cucumber appetiser, free flow of tea and greens. Totally worth the wait and the calories.
4
I visited Din Tai Fung with some friends and they did the ordering but the selection was great and course after course exceeded my expectations. The service was also very good. Normally they said there were lines to get in but we were lucky and they found a table right away. I suppose be aware that there are sometimes lines and while the restaurant can seem crowded it is well managed and clean
3
I was expecting the food to be according to my Indian taste but it was not. I was struggling to find something vegetarian to eat which was good. Definitely not trying this place again -- though I loved the service at this place. My relatives loved the place though
3
Meal started with warm tiger beer which wasn't ideal. Prawn noodle soup was quite bland and noodles were a solid block in the bowl. The addition of chili sauce and soy sauce to the noodles made them palatable. Vegetarian dim sum were also bland and I would not recommend them. My colleagues thought the other dim sums were flavorsome and thoroughly enjoyed them.
5
I know that this is a chain restaurant with locations all over Asian, it is still one of my favorite places to eat. You do have to look past the fact you're eating in the mall and you will enjoy the food. I have been to the one in Taiwan before and now in Singapore. Both times were consistently good. Luckily, we went at an off time so we did not have to wait long to get seated and served. As always the dumplings were very good and the buns were flavorful as well. This time we tried the duck spring rolls, which are now my new favorite
5
This is truly one of the gems of Singapore. Originally from Taiwan, Din Tai Fung brings taiwanese food to multi-cultural mouths. Their mouth-watering dumplings are enough to satisfy even the most ravenous stomach (like my brother!).  My least favourite part of Din Tai Fung is either waiting in line to get in (that's why I usually go early) or when I have to go. The staff are very friendly as well as bilingual (they could be trilingual, but I don't know enough languages to test that). The service is consistently good but dessert comes a bit slow sometimes
5
This place is difficult to get into....you have to register, stand in line, try and choose what you want to order while waiting, but it is all worth it! Efficient and excellent service, fine dining at fast food speeds, exquisite tastes and flavours at surprisingly reasonable prices....overall an experience to remember. Without hesitation would rate it as one of the better dining experiences in Singapore and would recommend it.

Can never go wrong here. Everything was perfect. The noodles were so fresh you could feel it with its texture and flavor. The dim sum is also perfect. Loved the crab one in particular. Mango pudding is still my favorite. Love going back here and never get disappointed
4
The decor isn‚Äôt the most refined, the tables are small, the chairs not particularly comfortable and the ceiling is low, but we‚Äôd been recommended this place so we disregarded all of the above.We didn‚Äôt wait to be seated though it was early afternoon. The waitress brought jasmine tea, the menu and a curious contraption on legs with a cover in which to place our bags, the minute we sat down. We wanted dumplings so that‚Äôs what we went for, including the signature steamed truffle and pork and steamed gourd and shrimp dumplings, as well as bok choi along with two bottles of beer. The dumplings were fabulous with tasty, crunchy (for the vegetables) fillings but the vegetables were disappointing, slightly watery and under seasoned. Service was efficient but not particularly friendly. The bill was salty for Singapore but then we were shocked at how much more food here costs these days.Go for the dumplings which mitigate the place‚Äôs other shortcomings
5
Taiwanese xiao long bao is very well know especially with their pork base and crab base . Do try their dou miau veg , it is amazing.
4
they have a great food, nice flavor. the xiao lung pao is the best. sweet and juicy. but the queue was quite long. you need to queue about 20 mins to get table
5
the food is great and the hot and sour soup is perfect many dumpling to try , beware sometime long waiting line but worth the wait , we will go back for sure
5
This came recommended to us by some friends who live in Singapore. It's great for kids, too! They put the food on child plates which my kids always love! The pork dumplings were awesome!
5
Stopping for one night in Singapore on the way to Japan I made sure we went for lunch to this restaurant. As always very busy we had to wait few minutes for the table. The dumplings were delicious, my favourite ones steamed pork to die for. Stir-fried vegies with garlic very tasty.Jasmine tea is seved all the time
5
My boyfriend introduced me to this branch because the quality of the food there is consistent and the ambience is good. On top of that, it is relatively big and quieter. The queues are long but not if you come around early weekday evenings (i.e. around 530pm). The service is excellent and you have an additional basket to place your bag and cover it. Worth to visit
4
Din Tai Fung (Paragon Branch) wanted to try this place for a while now. Overall a nice place lively ambience and great to be able to see their dumplings being made by hand. Just watching the chefs preparing the dumplings its worth to going there. The handmade dumplings with various fillings are delicious. We tried the vegetarian chive steamed dumplings which were all uniform and made perfectly, and Their Xiao Long Bao are quite good, again perfectly made and delicate and very moist. Perfect for brunch, lunch or dinner. Menu is quite extensive it does feel like a chain restaurant. Be prepared to queue for some time because this place is highly visited, waiting time can be 60 minutes over, try to avoid peak times around noon and 6pm. big plus also goes for the service is efficient, and the staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one
4
Clean restaurant, good dumplings, long queues.Remember this is a chain and it feels a bit like it. But the quality is very consistent. The variety is great. Very tasty. Unfortunately you cannot just go and eat, most of the times, specially for lunch the queues are very long, and people is happy to wait 40mins
5
Now Din Tai Fung to me is the holy grail of Xiaolongbao. Being from India where there are no outlets, I have often thought of making trips to Singapore with the sole purpose of eating at Din Tai Fung. The consistency of taste and quality of food is simply outstanding. I have not come across any other restaurant that can match up to the consistency and the taste as Din Tai Fung. I must have dined at this place at-least 8-10 times during my last trip to Singapore. The hot and Sour soup has the perfect balance of tangy and spicy flavour. Their trade mark Chicken Dumplings are out of the world. I would recommend their spinach dumplings, spinach and pork dumpling, Spicy Noodles, Egg fried rice and Glutinous dates All the food goes very well with their bottomless cup of Jasmine tea. The place is known for their cleanliness and their fast and quick service. Its a must visit place for all wanting to experience Michelin grade food without drilling any holes into your pocket
5
We ate here twice and we were very happy with the service, the quality and taste. We ordered the Sliced Duck in Crispy Spring Onion Pastry, Stir-fried Hong Kong Kailan with Special Sauce, Steamed Chicken Soup, Deep-fried Specially Marinated Pork Chop, Steamed Vegetable & Pork Dumplings and Steamed Custard Buns (we adore them!). Their food is not too salty, not oily and the flavours are consistent. Must try
4
My business associate was happy like a lark - her xiow long pao cravings satisfied!
I was never a fan, however, after this visit,
I know they are serious about using the freshest ingredients to ensure top quality Chinese cuisine. Keep up the good work!
5
We always visit this one when visiting Singapore. Reliable and you know you always get good food and good selection.
4
Having visited Din Tai Fung in Sydney I was glad to have this restaurant for lunch while in Singapore. Great as always
5
Located in orchard road, I really enjoyed dinner .
Good variety of dim sum, spicy noodles, fried rice with prawns, different vegetables . To drink a good tea and tiger beer is a must. Recommended .
3
I had tried in Bangkok and Singapore near time, every time i see a lot of people queuing. But i have seen my spices felt normal, so normal. And the cost is not cheap.
4
Located in B1 of a high end mall, in a shopping district, this branch is spatious and the open kitchen is at the center of the dining rooms. Easy listening music in the background, went there for early dinner at 5pm, quite and comfortable. In the menu, great selection of steamed soup (including signature steamed chicken soup), sreamed dumplings priced from 9 to 16$ depending on the filling(portions of 6 or10). I recommend the chilli crabs dumplings. I also love their cold puddings, the mango one is an amazing cleanser. They also offer a side menu with chefs creations of the day. Service is not their forte, impatient waiters, probably due to the high volume of attendance, but still for the price, could be a bit better. Overall, always a blast when i crave great dim sums
4
When we first entered the restaurant, everything appeared to be a little bit confusing. But our waitress was very polite, taking us (four people) to a free, reasonably quiet table in a corner, patiently suggesting us dishes to eat and helping us to choose gluten-free items to order. The food came quickly, and it was good, albeit perhaps a little bit expensive. Recommended
5
If you want great Dim Sum whilst in Singapore, make sure you visit Din Tai Fung. Good value and delicious food. All branches we visited in Singapore required queuing, but a maximum of 20minutes. Well worth the wait!Pork and truffle dim sum and the hot and sour soup recommended
4
No mucking around at this Michelin star dim sum outlet! If you like dumplings this is the place for you! Just be prepared to queue, take a number and be nimble when you are called. Follow me calls the hostess and you better move it! All great fun and part of the Chinese culture. No beg your pardons here; just get on with! Eat, drink, enjoy all fast paced and out the door with full happy tummies. Love it!
4
Last business night in Singapore with my colleagues brought u's to Din Tai Fung @ Paragon Beach, recommandeer by my Singapore colleagues. Thee were absolutely right claiming this restaurant to be one of the best in presenting various DimSum dishes. We were absolutely surprised with the god and tast Goods. Fully recommend this restaurant, you Will not be disappointed
5
this is a very popular place with locals and tourists. it is consistently good. service is quick and polite, tea is plentiful, and the prices are reasonable. other dishes are very good too but we go here for the wonderful dumplings, made as you watch.
4
Wherever I go, I will always visit a Din Tai Fung restaurant. The Paragon Din Tai Fung is another restaurant offered good quality soup dumplings. Their prawn fried rice should also be tried as they are tasty as well.
5
We visited the branch at the Seletar Mall. No queues and a demonstration of dumplings being made. Pork dumplings with soup inside were delicious and the duck rolls were very popular with the kids. Definitely worth a visit!!
5
18 months on on from my last visit to Singapore I could not wait to get back to Din Dai Fung, especially since the new outlet in Dubai is such a disappointment. We visited on Thurs 19 Jan and wow what a difference! So good to eat the proper version again. Insane soup dumplings, insane fried rice, cold beer and quick service. Epi
4
I heard so much about how good this restaurant is but our problem is that almost all of its restaurants in Singapore have long queues. We went to its Paragon Shopping Mall branch on a weekday. It is at the basement and lucky for us there was no queue. We were immediately ushered inside. All our bags and even umbrellas were placed in a clothes basket(similar to what you can buy in Ikea) that was beside our table. We ordered fried rice with pork, tofu with water chestnut, spinach fried in garlic and their meat and shrimp buns. We were fully satisfied with what we ordered. Food was great.We would definitely come back 
4
If dumplings are your forte then this restaurant is a must. Efficient and very good service the soup dumplings are really delicious. Copious amounts of tea provided and the orders were delivered quickly. Amazing to see the cooks preparing and cooking the food. We were there for late lunch so no difficulty in getting a table but would suggest booking or early arrival for dinner
5
This is the first time we've dined at the Paragon branch but we've visited Din Tai Fung around the world. The food is always great. Really love the duck in onion pastry (which you can't get at every Din Tai Fung) and the refreshing lemongrass juice. We always have the dumplings. They are delicious! You will almost always queue but the wait is worth it and generally not too long. You must try
5
The xiao long bao (pork dumplings) and fried rice with pork chop is a must try. The soup dumplings is in my opinion the best that you can find in Singapore, rivals the one served at the Crystal Jade and Paradise Dynasty group of chinese restaurants. The dumpling bursts in your mouth! Be sure to consume it as soon as it reaches your table as it cools down quickly and won't taste great when cold. The noodles are also fantastic. Been here several times and the quality and taste of the food is always consistent.Tip: Come early! Before 7pm (earlier the better) would be good to avoid long wait times. The restaurant does not take reservations so being early is essential if you do not want to be stuck in a long queu
4
We arrived at 6.45pm and were happy to see no queues (there's usually a long line of people waiting outside). Our family of five (incl. 3 kids under 6 years of age) was promptly seated, high chairs and children cutlery provided, and even though the waitress warned us of the food taking 25-30min to arrive, it took much less than that. We ordered a variety of dishes, all were tasty, though I've tasted better dumplings elsewhere. All in all, no major complaints. I recommend this place!
5
We visited Din Thai Fung once at Wisma Atria Mall and a second time at Suntec City Mall (Tower 5 - basement) during our 4 nights stay in Singapore. The Steamed Pork Dumplings (plain) & with crab meat, are really special. We also tried the crab buns which were excellent !There are many more dishes on the menu, but we simply did not have the time to relish them
4
Went here for lunch on saturday with my bf, very crowded yet the queue are not taking that long ! we ordered dry noodles which is good, lemon grass tea are not bad either.
5
I spent lots of Chinese restaurant whilst im in SG but the best restaurant is this!!!!!!! I love all in the menu I think I tried heaps of different foods here and just very tasty can't help to spend more ....
5
One word - yum! So delicious! Our friends took us here for dinner and we all loved it so much, we went for lunch the next day! The dumplings are to die for!
5
It hardly needs any more praise. But it deserves any bit of praise it gets. The service is second to none and the food is always an experience. The only negative with this place is that you end up visiting it so many times that you just grow a bit tired of the food and you need some rest before you visit it again
5
Always attracted by a Restuarant with a queue outside. While queuing you select your food and drink on a list and hand to the waitress when seated - very efficient. The food and drink arrived quickly and was excellent. Great food, excellent service and a low price - what more can you ask
5
Din Tai Fung possibly represents the best the best value in Singapore for dining. We covered a meal for 7 and was by far our lowest cost dining of the week.The choice is endless with something for every taste, even if your a visitor to Asia and your ambition is not the highest level.The dim sum/dumplings are all excellent and we tried many varieties
5
Everytime I come back to Singapore Din Tai Fung is the first restaurant to visit on my list! Since they do not accept reservations, there are often long waiting times however it is absolutely worth it. While waiting in line you can watch the Chef's make the Xiao Long Baos. Each and every one is crafted so carefully, it is truly and art. The food comes out as ready to ensure the freshness of each dish. I always order the Oriental Salad in Special Vinegar Dressing, Pork Chop Fried Rice, and Steamed Yam Paste Dumplings for dessert
5
This was my third visit to Din Tai Fung,second time in Singapore. I had never been to this branch though before ever. When you go to Din Tai Fung you should be prepared to wait for a table. Same was the case here,except that the wait time was almost an hour.I was by myself and hence did not order a lot of food. Traditional hot and sour soup was made well and served at the right temperature. I also ordered for a prawn toast which was crisp and delicious. The egg fried rice was equally good like every time in the past.Din Tai Fung has been consistently good restaurant and it's much recommended
4
It's where you want to go and grab a good yummy no fuss meal. No reservations - everyone has to go and get in line. You can send someone earlier to take a queue number but I think everyone has to be present or else they won't seat you. I go for the Xiao long pao. That's what they are famous for. But the noodles are good too. Good variety and I think reasonably priced. It's a Chinese restaurant atmosphere. And it does Citibank instant rewards. And they do actually ask you! I find most places don't ask if you'd like to use that, they actually did. So I like that. Kind of thinking about saving you some money using your rewards
5
The wait is definitely worth it here. I was very happy with my crab & pork xiao long bao, truffle xiao long bao, and chili crab buns. The quality of the food here is just really good, so if you are in the mood for really good dim sum or rice meals, this is a sure thing. It's a bit pricey but if money isn't a concern for a good meal, then you won't be disappointed
5
Fanatastic food. A little pricey, perhaps, but then eating out in Singapore is not cheap. This restaurant specialises in dumplings but there are plenty of other dishes available.
4
Despite being better known for its lamian, it serves up a tasty fried rice with great wok hei. Nice appetisers with crunchy vegetables. The xiao long bao are a must.
5
We had a lovely lunch here, it was fast and the dumplings were amazing. We have eaten at this chain before, and the quality is always amazing, no wonder people queue to go.
5
The best dumplings i have ever had. Wonderful service with free unlimited jasmine tea. Fun to see the chefs prepare everything. Well priced
5
The Xiao Long Bao were perfect! With so many branches in Singapore, and throughout Asia, one can never know if the quality will be as good as the original. I've been to over 20 branches, including the original one in Taipei, and can tell you that the XLB were perfect! I wish they still did the cucumber tower the old way, but it seems most branches do it the way in the picture now
5
Even for people coming from the West, U.S. or Europe..., this kind of Asian food is very easy to take.I love those dumplings. The noodles are also good. Much like "ravioli" in fact, just thinner, and there is a broth inside. You get some practice eating them with the chopsticks and spoon, and you are as good as a local.Then they have the sweet dumplings for dessert, with read beans and lotus paste. I wouldn't think much of beans for dessert! But they are very enjoyable.The only problem with this place is that I always eat too much :
5
Din Tai Fung always delivers. Suburb dumplings with an array of seasonal favourites worth trying. I always have a traditional selection plus a couple of new things - this time prawn pancake. A special mention for the iced lemon grass tea and iced rosella tea. Only negative is they charge $12(S) for a small bottle of Tiger beer. They have several outlets in Singapore.
5
I've been to this restaurant on multiple occasions and every single time the food was absolutely delicious. The original dumplings, the fried rice with pork chop, the stewed beancurd (I though I didn't like it, but it's amazing) and the genuinely delicious custard steamed buns that are exclusive of the paragon branch.If I could only have one meal in Singapore, I'm sure it would be here
5
The restaurant ambiance is perfect to enjoy every single piece of dumpling if you are a dumpling lover this will be a great experience for you and your tongue since the first bite; every single piece is soft, fresh and juicy.We tried different stuffs and our favorite was the lobster as well as the cak
4
My family loves all the food here... egg fried rice (ËõãÁÇíÈ•≠), salad (Â∞èËèú), drunken chicken (‰∏äÊµ∑ÈÜâÈ∏°), pork chop (ÁÇ∏ÊéíÈ™®) etc... all taste nice! And kids just love the stir-fried dou miao (ËíúÊäÑË±ÜËãó), they can wolf down a whole plate on their own, which is a rarity for vegetables
5
Much better than other branches that had long lines ... good food not too expensive and good location
5
Best dim sum place in orchard sways great food and quick even when it's busy. Prices are good and the quality of the food is always the best.
5
I ended up there completely by accident, but what a pleasant surprise. The dumplings were to die for! The service was great, and very child friendly - my little one got the cutest cutlery set. My favorite ones were the barbecue pork.
3
Service was efficient, but I couldn't say friendly. Service was quick and the Xialong Bao good but it wasn't so amazing I have to go back. Ok for a quick pit stop of Xialong Bao and be on your way.
4
Had a good meal here and most of the dishes we ordered were great although the special mushroom dumplings were a bit of a disappointment and the noodle soup we chose was a bit bland. The people at the next table looked to have made a better choice on the noodles. It is a very popular restaurant with a queuing system I had not encountered before. You get allocated a number in the queue and menu where you select what you want to eat. We had to wait about 20 minutes to get our table but we're then served very quickly
5
We happened on Din Tai Fung which is one of a chain of dumpling restaurants, which originated in Taiwan and several of which boast a Michelin Star. The place was obviously very popular as other places in the complex were half empty while there was a waiting time of 25 minutes at Din Tai Fung. Of course, it was Sunday and they're don't take bookings but we watched teams of masked chefs make the dumplings and buns while we waiting and it was fascinating to see their skill. When we got our food, it was worth the wait as everything was delicious - especially the two types of dumplings and the sesame spinach. Service was efficient apart from our spring rolls which had been forgotten but they soon arrived when we asked.The bills was surprisingly low for our memorable meal. We hope to go back again while we're still in Singapore
4
Visited our favourite haunt in Singapore this past weekend and I have to say that they know how to keep a good thing going. Of course we got there early so we were seated almost immediately which was great for a Saturday afternoon - no dreaded wait with the board chiming down to your being seated. The pork xiao long bao was exactly as we remembered them - small succulent parcels with all the soupy goodness, the egg fried rice and the stir fried spinach with garlic cutting through the fat of those tasty morsels quite effectively. The tea came promptly and endlessly which helped digest our food even quicker. The service in contrast to some of our other visits in the past seemed more personable and the new staff checked in on us quite often.For efficient, tasty meals this is an oldie but goodie in the tony Paragon mall - a great respite from the shops
5
I was excited to read all the great reviews for this place. I did not realize that it is in a mall!!! We don't have food like this in US shopping malls. I love dumplings and these were the best I have ever had. I live near San Fransisco and have had dumplings in Vancouver, Montreal and Hong Kong. These were clealy the best! I also had steamed bun stuffed with chilli crab.............WOWOWOWOWOWOOWOW!!!! If you travel to Singapore, do not miss this place. I repeat.. eat here at all costs!! :-
4
Just watching the chefs preparing the dumplings its worth to going there. Be prepared to queue for some time because this place is highly frequented. The handmade dumplings with various fillings are delicious. The service is efficient and rather to quick to enjoy all the different flavors. The secret star is the fried rice. A must try. Its good to go in a group to enjoy as many as possible dumplings. Avoid peak times around noon and 6pm. Waiting time can be 60 minutes over. The only downside is the price. Good to know is handmade so its more easy to understand the price.
5
Yes is true, you have some waiting time average 15/20 min, yes is true is not a fine dining restaurant, Yes is true that sometimes you feel like in rush to give a seat to who is waiting outside... but the quality of the food is absolutely great, Xiao long bao (Chinese soup dumplings filled with hot broth) are absolutely fantastic, the spicy wontons, tossed in a fiery red chili sauce, are excellent and you should give a try with the nutty dry noodles with minced pork. All dishes freshly prepared and served in a few minutes.Each time i'm in Singapore i never miss a visit to Din Tai Fung 
3
Dinner last night at DTF in the Paragon Mall in Singapore, and while the meal was "good", the food had little character. The xiao long bao were lacking in flavor. Soups were good, but overall it was a very average performance.
5
A superb restaurant, reasonably extensive menu.
very good service and argubaly the best dimsums in singapore
wish they would add some more types of chicken dimsums in the menus
5
A great restaurant with an impressive system, making it very efficient with short waiting time for food. Quality of the dumplings second to none.
4
Great place for food, busy though and very open, you can see into the kitchens and watch the dumplings being made by hand, really nice food
5
My colleague told me this is his favorite place to dine. I thought it was fantastic. I was staying at the Marriott Tang Plaza and after a long day of work we wanted to get a decent dinner. My friend suggested Din Tai Fung and we walked over from the Orchard metro stop. I let my friend do all the ordering, so I don't recall all we had. There was a dish with fresh cooked spinach that was fantastic, and the dumplings are all different and tasty.I think that this place is really great and I plan to return when I am back in Dingapore in February
5
Din Tai Fung is a Taiwanese Michellin star rated chain that specialises in Xialong Bao (soup dumpling). The most widely known DIn Tai Fung in Singapore with tourists is the Marina Bay Sands shopping centre branch. The average wait for a table there can be upwards of 45 minutes. The Paragon centre in Orchard road is just as good usually doesn't have the huge wait times - we were seated instantly.As with other Din Tai Fungs (we've tried their Australian, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singaporean branches), the food is excellent - exquisite in fact...
5
This Paragon branch is much better than others. The restaurant itself has a much better ambience than others (especially Serangoon Central which does not resemble the offerings at other branches).The XLB are big, juicy and with light skins. The Oriental Salad was really tasty and so were the Oriental Wontons with Black Vinegar.We love coming back here again and again
1
I was shocked at terribly poor services by all the waitress upon our visit on 29 Sept 2016 noon. We arrived at 12:15pm while restaurant was only 60% full, nonetheless, we were made to wait for 5mins at counter without any staff attending to us. We were finally seated after waived at 3 staff who seemed unable to notice our presence. After signalled several staff, finally one waitress came to put order with a frowning face. We were told to wait for 25 mins at least for all the items, well, we were fine with it. However, our food came in fact within 5 mins. (Guess the waitress was hoping we wouldn't want to wait and perhaps we might leave???) We asked for 3 big bowls from the waitress who took away our order which never came, thus tried 2nd time but got 3 small bowls! Made the 3rd attempt, a waitress finally threw 3 big bowls reluctantly with a furious look!To make things worse, our chicken soup was full of bones, chicken XLB broke straightaway before we touched them with chopsticks.Probably this answers why the crowd is much less compared to last time, if I were the owner, I would sack all the staff with poor service, since they're doing anything good for company well they're paid a salary
3
The ambiance and cleanliness was good. The staff was attentive to the customers. There is a kitchen that shows the people that makes dimsum. They make the dimsum as you order. It is so watery not the typical dimsum that is filled up but moist. Their chef salad was good, the beef brisket noodles was so oily that I did not eat, the truffles dimsum which was $5 each was good. For the service and ambiance was good but they need to work on their dimsum and the oily food
4
Probably the best buns and dumplings and hot and sour soup that I've ever had. Ambiance in the basement of the Paragon shopping centre could have been better but I was in a little bit of food heaven despite the location. Would absolutely return. Mushroom buns were amazing
5
The food here is awesome. A must try for all dim sum lovers. A good selection of dim sum. The service was nice and speedy. We went during off peak but I hear that is can get quite crowded. Enjoyed our meal immensely!
5
Beautiful, fresh dumplings with fast service. we tried the vegetable ones which were lovely and the crab and pork buns which were full of flavour.
4
this place is famous for their dumplings and this is what you will come here for. the rest of the menu is ok, but come here for the famous dumplings
4
After a long walk along Orchard Road, we had dinner in this chinese restaurant.
Good service, fresh food, cool place. The place was full but vacancies later emerge.
Try it to appreciate!
5
one of the best taste that i know....dont come at the lunch or dinner time, the quee its so long..u can see the traditional cooking process by opne kitchen that they have...
4
Dumplings, steamed buns and noodles... It's their mainstay. Delicious. Dumplings with saut√É¬©ed mushrooms and truffle oil? Oh yes... Now that's divine. I also had fried tofu stuffed w veggies and water chestnuts. The tofu itself was a bit mushy inside, but the crunch of the bits of water chestnuts made it really interesting. I liked it a lot. My dinner associates both enjoyed noodle dishes and loved them. One with mushrooms and pork, the other with soup and pork wontons. Din Tai Fung doesn't really have any dinner atmosphere to speak of, but the waitstaff is friendly and helpful. Orders arrive in random order by a masked bandit from the kitchen who marks off on a menu list at the edge of your table. A bit odd. The dumplings take some time, but they're worth every minute of the wait. The kitchen is filled with wonton masters, rolling, squishing, filling and stacking. You can watch them as you come or go, as the kitchen is glass enclosed. Their work is almost mesmerizing. But watch them or not, eat their dumplings. Truly delicious.
5
Had heard a lot about this restaurant which has about 20 outlets in Singapore.Since we happened to be at the Paragon Mall on Orchard Road, we thought we would give it a try - expectedly, there was a long queue with an estimated waiting of 25 minutes; speaks volumes about the popularity.While we were given a token number, we were also given a menu card so that we could decide beforehand and hence not waste time in deciding the menu after being seated - our selections are ticked off and handed over so that by the time you are seated, your order is almost ready. An effective way of ensuring a fast turnaround of the customers.Well, we were seated in about 20 minutes - and, our order with the bill was presented immediately - it was their way of reconfirming our order and also, at the end of the meal, you do not have to wait for the bill which, incidentally, is not paid at the table but at a separate counter.Ordered shrimp and egg fried rice along with vegetable pork dumplings and chilling crab bun.Excellent is not the word to describe the food - much, much more!The shrimp and egg fried rice was so good that we ordered one more plate.DO VISIT if you are in Singapore.
4
Aside from the xiao long bao, the beef noodle is a worthy order. So is the pork chop served on top of fried rice, and the dan dan mian. Din Tai Fung is comfort food for my children, as I observe it is for many Singaporean families...
4
The food is very good but a lot of it is cold. This is not a full fledged restaurant but more snacky or for lunch type. You can see the staff make the food specially dumplings and are very hygienic which gives one added comfort. Over all good for quick food unless it's full which is usually
4
We were a group of 7 visiting for weekend lunch. some vegetarians and others meat eaters. The paragon outlet has a wide choice of vegetarian options. In the vegetation selections, we ordered tofu dumplings, mushroom dumplings, vegetable fried rice, vegetable and custard buns. The presentation was superb and the dumplings were one of the best we have eaten. Dessert was excellent fusion of Chinese dumpling and western dessert: we ordered red bean dumpling with chocolate lava. The wait can be Long
3
Not a bad place to eat but there are many other good food around this area. You just have to explore and find out more places to eat.
4
The venue is busy and clearly popular. The food is good and quick. The restaurant is enjoyable, staff work at a professional and speedy pace. Not friendly but efficient. Well worth going to, and quick for a lunch
4
This restaurant have many delicious food and the speacial foods are dumpling, chicken soup and pork chop fried rice
But the prices bit expensive
5
Everything! Everything tastes great! If you are in proximity of a Din Tai Fung just get in line and wait for a table - always worth it!
4
It is a well organise dumpling chain, I am quite amazing although it has numerous chain in different area. The quality of the food it has not lost the idendity as the food u can tell is fresh. I don't know how it is the service in general. However, the chain in the paragon underground wEre very attentive and effective. In u look for one that got better environment, I saw one with view between ION and takashamas center
5
Been to the one in Dubai, Seattle and now Singapore. This one is by far the best one. It was so good, I went twice in one week. Of course, these are all just satellites and I'm waiting to achieve nirvana when I finally experience the mother ship's version of xiao long bao in Taipei
4
Always good food there. But it's slow!!! Always busy. Got there at 11:30 on a Saturday. Was full within 30mn. Dumplings are good, noodles with chili sauce too. Popular. Always busy. So they don't really mind if patrons wait and wait for the food to be ready..

Couldn't find Din Tai Fung, Singapore Parkway Parade Branch@TA, thus comment over here. Last month, we tasted the crab meat xiao long bao and they were very delicious! It's different from the normal ones. As usual, we ordered our favourite appetizers such as Xiao Cai ÔºàÂ∞èËèúÔºâand Suan Ni Bai Rou (ËíúÊ≥•ÁôΩËÇâÔºâ„ÄÇWe also tasted their noodles, Zha Jiang Mian ÁÇ∏ÈÖ±Èù¢Ôºåtheir prawn fried rice and chicken soup.We always enjoy our meals at Din Tai Fung. We have had close to 20 meals at different outlets, if not more. The queue can be rather discouraging at times, however, the tasty food will always make up for it

I enjoyed my first visit so much I went back again - both the pork and chilli dumplings were delicious as was the noodles and mince but also the pork and egg rice. Very friendly and helpful staff member who saw I was cold and bought me a shawl and provided a shopping holder with cover
4
We stumbled upon the food court in the basement of the Paragon Shopping Centre. Din Tai Fung had a line of people waiting outside (around 7pm) and advertised a 30 minute wait for a meal. We went for a walk and returned in half an hour to a much quieter restaurant. The waitress automatically brought us green tea, pickled ginger, soy sauce and very hot chilli oil and a little trolley for my bag. We ate oriental salad, sliced duck in pastry, pork dumplings and shrimp fried rice. It was all lovely, particularly the dumplings. It was a novel and tasty experience, reasonably priced and I would happily return next time we are in Singapore

Loving the vibe in this place. Great staff and service provided. Came with friends in late July. Got to say we loved the food. Especially the Friend egg rice
5
Spent an hour in the line waiting to get a seat but it was well worth it! The soup dumplings were by far the best I have tried and the fried rice was spectacular! Definetly worth the wait and the hype!
4
Consistency in the dumplings they make. Really nice lamien as well and service was relatively fast. It may get a little crowded during dinner hours.
4
Great restaurant! Delicious food! Would definitely go back. Very well organised, efficient staff. Welcoming atmosphere.

I truly love Xiao Long Bao in Din Tai Fung restaurant! You should try once in your life!
Actually there are many brunch in Singapore but I recommend this shop because not many people so you don't have to wait too long,.

Din Tai Fung is a well known restaurant from Taiwan, specialising in xiaolongbao (steamed pork dumplings). It has a number of branches in Singapore with Paragon outlet as the flagship outlet in Singapore. The outlet was also one of the largest in Singapore with a private dining room.I reached the outlet just before it opened for business and could spot about 10 people waiting outside the restaurant. I was swiftly showed to a table. The staff also kindly provided me with a bag basket to put my handbag, plus a cloth to cover it. Hot tea was served without asked, and was chargeable at $1++.Steamed Custard Bun ÊµÅÊ≤ôÂåÖ ($2++)The bun was served pipping hot. The skin was thin and smooth with its filling flowing out easily like lava.Steamed Assorted Bun Infused with Truffle Oil ËèåËèáÂ§ßÂåÖ ($2++)Similar to the Steamed Custard Bun, the skin was thin. It was nicely smelled of truffle oil. The chopped mushroom filling was juicy and flavourful.Deep-fried Handmade Tofu with Water Chestnuts & Mushrooms ÈÖ•ÁÇ∏Á¥†Ë±ÜËÖê ($8.60++)Served with sweet chilli sauce.The tofu was quite crispy on the outside. Inside it was soft and different from the usual tofu. It was packed with shredded black fungus, shiitake mushrooms and water chestnuts. The black fungus and water chestnuts gave the tofu a unique crunchy texture. The mushrooms gave a earthy taste to the simple looking tofu.Steamed Layered Red Date Cakes Êû£Ê≥•Á≥ï ($4.80++ / 2 pieces)The simple looking cake had a kueh kueh texture, being sticky and chewy. It had a kind of unique sweetness.Overall the food was not bad. The tea was refilled often. Although it was just 11am, queue was already formed outside the restaurant
5
I visit every time I am in Singapore and never leave without a smile on my face. Try to avoid the lunch and dinner rush to ensure you are not spending too much time in the queue. I never order all at once to avoid table crowding as it sometimes all comes out at the same time.
5
first impression is the Window looking into the Kitchen where 8-10 cooks are preparing the Dumplings. each hand crafted with such skill. You'll want to video this... then the service, impecable fast moving people, efficient service, you wait, you get in, you order, you get served!! ... there's a wait for the table, but IT IS worth IT!... prices are affordable, food is delicious!
4
Extremely popular venue at times with a long queue. We have been a number of times to various outlets and are always amused by the absolutely stern, unfriendly greeting we receive from the receptionist who is all business, no nonsense and totally perfunctory. However, this seems to be part of the experience and the dumplings are always excellent

One of my very favourite restaurants in the world. I've been to Din Tai Fung many times but never got around to writing a review. I've just been back to Singapore for the first time in a while and tonight I have been to feast myself on some Lovely Dim Sum.The place is clean, the staff friendly, and the bonus is that you can watch the chefs make your Dim Sum and have the food cooked /steamed. The menu is comprehensive, and the service friendly and quick. As you sit down, a cloth stand is placed next to your table to place your shopping so it's not on a seat, the table or the floor. Good Idea. the menu is presented and on the table you are given Green Tea, Some seasonings are also placed on the table. Soy, Vinegar and a chillie paste in oil. Beware, the paste is HOT!The Menu includes photos of the dishes and there are many choices of 6 or 10 pieces. No alcohol is served, but plenty of soft drinks and fruit juices.This time I had Fried Rice with Shredded Pork and Egg, and Crab and Pork Dumplings and a special Mushroom Dumplings with Truffle. Very Juicy and tasty! All served piping hot in Bamboo steamers. As you cleared plates/serving plates, they are cleared efficiently. The Green Tea is topped up regularly. How someone else can say the service was extremely impersonal is totally beyond me. In the many times I have been there the service has been very friendly. My visit on the evening of this review, was at about 5:50pm and the place was 3/4 full. Children, Couples, Families and Singles all seated quickly, but I have been there at lunchtime and you do have to wait for seating, but you are told how long you may have to wait for a table.There is also a take away at the branch I was at.There is a large plaque outside celebrating a New York Times review that it is one of the Worlds Top Ten Restaurants. Apparently there are 19 branches of the restaurant around Singapore and I have seen a branch in Bangkok too.If you have never tried Dim Sum and find yourself in Singapore I do recommend a try. If you do, I hope you enjoy your food and your experience
5
Highly reccomended - excellent food - large variety on the menu - clean restaurant - fast service - try dim sum with truffle
5
We visited twice, both times the food & service was excellent.
The dumplings are some of the best we have eaten.
Continuous jasmine tea was lovely. Great value for money. Would highly recommend for lunch or dinner.
5
DinTaiFung has so far never failed to satisfy me in both the food and the experience. They are very well run operationally, and their food quality remains good and consistent (its my weight that keeps going up). Service is great too and they are considerate enough to provide a pull-open standing storage for your bags or belongings. Especially useful in case someone bites into the dumpling and spurts the soup out towards his/her neighbours :) As a mark of their success, just look at their Paragon outlet. It takes up like 3-4 huge units, the restaurant and kitchen spanning probably 3000 plus square feet. Recommended : Always the XiaoLongBao (dumplings with soup inside), and DanDan Mian (noodles in peanut sauce). Had the special season appetizer of black fungus. Portion is tiny for its price, but at least it tasted good 
3
This was my first visit to Din Tai Fung. The food was excellent, however the service was extremely impersonal (not sure if that is how it was supposed to be) wanted to ardor extra dumplings and then dessert but nobody even helped us. Perhaps it was due to us being only westerners in s predominantly Chinese part of Singapor
4
This is not cheap dining, however the food is really very good. The dumplings in particular are delicious and I would suggest anything with crab. There is a very large selection available all of which (so far) is worth trying. If you are willing to spend the money I would definitely give it a go. The staff don't know very good English, but you can get by just with the menu
4
Great xiaolongbao's - tasty and full of succulent juices. The beef noodles is very good as well. Only negative is that sometimes that queue is really long and the wait for the food took 20 minutes. They do however let us know about the waiting times prior to ordering
5
Din Tai Fung - the name says it all. Have been there 20+ times only did not review earlier. The Pork & prawn dumplings are the best probably - I like the dan dan noodle and the pork fired rice also with the special chili. Overall a place worth visitng again and again even though every time the waiting time gets longer :-
4
The restaurant is in the food court area of the Paragon Centre on Orchard Rd so its surprising to think that this restaurant has a michelin star. The restaurant is typical of a chinese restaurant in any major Australian city with busy staff, efficiency and noise. The food was fresh, hot and delicious. The staff friendly and efficient. There is a limited wine list. This is not the type of restaurant that you spend hours in. Its in, order, eat and leave. Having said that the price point was excellent at only just under $500 for 8 people which included 2 bottles of wine and beer. if you want to say you have been to a michelin star dumpling restaurant then this is the place to go
5
Once again a really good experience at Din Tai Fung Paragon. This has always been one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore. Really good service and the food is top quality. Pity they have removed the pickled lotus root from the menu as I was really looking forward to this. A real must if you are in Singapore
4
We got our timing wrong and were there at a busy time 1pm on Saturday. We've been previously earlier and not had to wait so long. When I asked about the wait time the staff were very apologetic and explained about the different items we had ordered.I don;t eat meat and the vegetarian dumplings are delicious. The peanut ones were unexpectedly sweet, and delicious as wel
4
Went with a group of 20, and received a wide variety of dumplings. Succulent and tasteful, with very friendly staff. Took less than 15 minutes to get a large table, despite the cue to get in
5
Having first experienced Din Tai Fung in Sydney it is very hard to have Chinese Dumplings anywhere else. The kitchen runs like a factory and you can see the staff making the dumplings in huge steamers. They do other options but Dumplings are their specialty.
5
We came to this place after reviews on Trip Advisor but had lowered our expectation to ensure we wouldn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t be disappointed. I have had some good dumplings across the face of the world so knew what to look out for. The first sign this was going to be good was the queue of people, we had to wait at least 30 minutes for a table, in the mean time got to enjoy the dozen plus chef preparing and making gorgeous dumplings right in front of us. The best is that they give you the menu to choose while you wait for your table, meaning that you place your order quickly and the food comes out right away. Now the food.. where to start except for WOW!!!! We ordered an array of dumplings and other treats and could not choose which was our favorite, their freshness, taste, flavor combination and delicacy are sensational. The price is very cheap for the quality of food you get. There are many Ding Tai Fung across Singapore but this one is apparently their best, having walked past others, they were not as big or as busy. This place is highly recommended if you find yourself in the Orchard area for a spot of shopping and want to taste truly something spectacular
5
It was our last day in Singapore. We were supposed to go to the Duk Tour but went to nearby Paragon Mall instead. It was almost lunchtime and since we didn't eat breakfast, we were starving. We didn't have any idea where to eat so I've asked the kind sales associate in Pandora if she has any suggestion. She told us that there is a restaurant on the first floor of the mall that is always full and has long line of patrons everyday. And there we go! It's Din Tai Fung! There were less customers when we arrived coz it was still early. They have many choices on the menu. We ordered dumplings, chicken, fried rice, etc. Pardon me for forgetting (It's been almost a year) but I do remember that everything taste sooo good! We took the leftover food with us and my brother ate it during our flight back to our country... Food was cold but still delicious! If we'll be back in Singapore, we will definitely dine here again.
4
This place is renowned for its dumplings, and specialising in the xiao long bao (steamed soup dumplings). We came here twice on our recent trip to Singapore as it is a quick easy place when shopping all day long.You usually find a 20 min wait, but its ok as you can start to plan your order. The food comes as soon as its ready, so just start eating.I love so much about this place; the only down side is the customer service - or lack of. Regardless, I would still return
5
Despite the fact this is a restaurants chain, they served the best dumpling I ever had! We tried several of them, with pork, with vegetables and shrimps, all of them delicious! they also served other dishes on top, but surely they are master in dumplings. This branch also serve one kind as dessert, this is a no miss! Interesting also watching how dumplings are prepared since all restaurants have open kitchen
4
Expect to wait, if its lunchtime, queue outside then wait 20 to 30 minutes to get your order. hygiene is great, we ordered hot and sour soup and wonton soup - it could have been hotter, try not to take this very popular chain for grante
5
I went here with my family and had the most amazing experience. The food was absolutely brilliant and the service was excellent. The ordering system that this restaurant used was extremely efficient and very quick. From the pork chop to the dumplings all the food was spectacular. But the main thing that stood out for us was the pork chop that was to die for. The house special dumplings... Well... Let's just say we went through a lot of them.My entire family watched spell-bounded as we saw the chefs make the dumplings. Overall Din Tai Fung is an terrific restaurant and I recommend it to everyone
4
We tried this place based on recommendations from friends. I was not too impressed with it. Food was decent and service was great, but I didn't get the hype people had for it. I thought flavor was marginal and overall experience was ok. Would I go back, maybe.
5
I lived in SG for 6 yrs and Din Tai Fung was one of my faves. They served really good tasting food, always fresh, authentic chinese, and free flow of hot black tea. If you're a first timer, I would recommend xiao long bao, crispy golden prawn pancake, noodles in fragrant mushroom and minced pork sauce, their siomai, and the very delightful century egg in minced ginger. These were out all time favourite and it never disappoints. They hand made all their noodles as well as their dimsum wrappers. Price however was a bit pricey as compared to Singapore's hawker restos but at least you're in a good-clean, nice-ambiance in all of it's branches accross SG. Go and have a try
5
Really delicious and fresh food. Very central location and an exciting menu. I was there for lunch and diner. I even saw the closing hour (all the time) cleaning. No words. It is worth every penny! Ideal also for children!
4
They had amazing dum sum. Not the cheapest but very very tasty food. It would be a good place to go to for lunch or dinner!
4
excellent place for both food & biz
Usually not crowded
If coming with big family or more than 6 people, reservation of table is recommended
Cheers,
Xian Xi - Singapore

What a find Voted top chinese restaurant for the past three years no wonder, great Dim Sum , wonton chicken soup , pork dumplings , prawn dumplings . Service was good with endless cups of chinese tea .
5
Ate here numerous times, tried many different items off the menu and they were all very tasty and good value. The service is also very friendly and the food comes out fast.
Best dumplings I've ever eaten.
3
Just the 2 of us went out for dinner. There was a que so we thought it must be good. The food was good, what we ordered we got. It tasted average nothing special but good. The delivery was quick. Would I go back yes. Quick service and clean restaurant and reasonably priced
5
I was here recently with my son's fianc√É¬©e and my three and a half year old grand daughter who adores dim sum.We decided upon brunch and aimed to arrive before the crowds because more often than not there is a queue outside. However, it was just after eleven and we smoothed straight in and ordered promptly.This whole set up is remarkably functional and efficient, the delicious food arrived promptly, my grand daughter demolished ten dumplings and we polished off the rest!In an out within forty five minutes, a perfect meal and the rest of the day free
4
@TheKuoKnowsJudging by the regular queues that form outside Din Tai Fung's Paragon outlet, the restaurant hardly needs recommending.But here's something that I have noticed: Don't let the mass of people outside the eatery ever put you off waiting. The restaurant tends to under-promise and over-deliver. So a 20-minute wait is never quite as long as it seems.That said, even a full 20-minute is worth it. If there is one must-have dish on the menu, then it has to be the Xiao Long Bao. They are heaven in pastry. Light and flavoursome. Juicy and full of goodness. When eating the dumplings, try to support them on a spoon to avoid losing any of the soup, which is unforgivable!While the dumplings might look small and dainty, they can be quite filling. So don't over-do things, even though the temptation to do so can be overwhelming.To gorge on the dumplings alone, would be a shame because Din Tai Fung's selection of noodles is very good too. My favourite is Dan Dan Noodles, with its piquant sauce.The fried rice is fragrant to a fault. I prefer the one with Pork Chop. But the Fried Rice with Prawns is just as good.Here's one thing to note about ordering a meal at Din Tai Fung. Remember what I said about how quickly the waiting queues move?The reason is quite simple. Din Tai Fung has a tendency to rush food from kitchen-to-table. So, if you are planning on a leisurely meal, don't order everything at once
5
Tried this place twice on our two-day stay and absolutely loved it. They have a simple but delicious dim sum selection and don't let the "chain restaurant" put you off - each dim sum in handmade and prepared fresh for you. You even get to see it for your own eyes. Staff are quick and efficient
4
We decided to have family dinner at Din Tai Fung Paragon. The place is very crowded and we have to wait for 30 mins. Love the pork dumplings. Service is generally good. The expand the place to have more seats. Waiting time for the food is ok. We had 1 dish not served for long time and finally cancel the food. Best dish is the braised beef noodle.
3
Having heard so much about this place we went quite excitedly but were fairly disappointed. The veggie options aren't much and the it was much too loud to enjoy a meal. The food itself was good but not amazing.
4
Very good and freshly made dumplings and amazing service. We liked the crab and shrimps dumplings and the duck pastry as appetizers.
4
Usually lunch on Saturday. Enjoy their fried rice with pork chop, oriental salad, double boiled chicken soup, garlic fragrance pork belly with cucumber, steamed pork dumpling, etc...
Great fragrant tea...
5
Australians need to experience this! Amazeballs! Wish we had them all over Aus and not just in Sydney!
5
Everything we ordered was spot-on exquisite. My only regret was not arriving with ten kilos less on me!
Unless you've very familiar with Chinese food, best that one visits with a friend who is and can do the ordering.
4
DIn Tai Fung is one of the best chinese restaurants that i have tried and the one in Singapore is equally as good as the one in Bangkok. From the appetizers to the noodles to the fried rice to the xiao long bao and earl grey lemon tea, there is nothing to complain about. A restaurant that all Chinese food lovers must try
5
This is still my favourite place for xiao long bao! Perfect thin skin which one can pick up without breaking. the meat filling is also not greasy unlike the ones that I have had the misfortune of eating when in China. I have tried xiao long baos in many places, big or small, and those big restaurants which specialise in northern China cuisine. All of them cannot beat Din Tai Fung standard of practically military precision in the way the make the dumplings and how it's delivered and savoured with the yummiest freshly sliced young ginger. They are happy to give heaps of ginger if you like eating with ginger so that's a huge draw for us. Having said that, I do not enjoy the wet fried rice served in Din Tai Fung and am not a huge fan of northern la mian style noodles though I don't mind the beef noodles if I have the choice. Some people also like the Taiwanese pork cutlet but do ask for it to be served on the side if you are having it with the soup noodles
3
We went over to Din Tai Fung as one of the office colleagues had raved about their chicken dumplings at this specific location.We went for lunch and despite a queue, we were seated quickly.We ordered a salad which was ok in my view and a couple of large portions of their chicken dumplings and their vegetarian dumplings.In my view, both were very average specially if you keep in mind the typical sui mai's you'd get if you were a fan of Indian Chinese cuisine.I'd not go again
4
There is no other restaurant I would choose over Din Tai Fung for Xiao Long Baos. Their steamed minced pork dumplings burst open in one's mouth to release flavorful broth and premium minced pork. Perfect texture. They also serve Xiao Long Baos filled with minced pork and minced crab meat. DELICIOUS
5
When you are served by a kind bunch of people, it just makes things so much better even before your first bite.Our section supervisor/manager at this restaurant in the basement of Paragon Centre was astute in advising us the range and quantity of dishes.We landed up here quite by accident and actually had eaten a few things before...but on tasting some of their dishes...we went on to eat a variety of dimsums...chicken, prawns, pork...each of which had to be eaten with a spoon and in one single bite as they had not just the flesh inside but also the soup within each dimsum. As a result, when you bite into them...they burst in your mouth with a wonderful splash of flavour.We had a good soup as well...though the dimsums overshadowed the other dishes.I understand its a Taiwanese brand been around in Singapore since quite a while now..
4
Try this 3 times. The dimsums are great. And so are the buns, soup. But avoid the noodles, they are not as good as ones you can find outside
5
The atmosphere was always busy. If you get there during lunch time, you will need to wait approximately 30-45 minutes to get a table. The service is very quick though. The turnover is fast. Food also came fast. Always order dumplings and the specialties there but not the noodles. The fried pork cutlet is also very good
4
Visited here for lunch today. You complete your menu choice whilst waiting for a table and then hand this to your server. We had some delicious dumplings, fried rice and pork and pancake rolls washed down with Pineapple, Celery & Carrot juice. Everything was delicious. Restaurant looked spotlessly clean and is obviously very popular. Recommended for a quick lunch whilst put and about.
5
While there are many branches of Din Tai Fung in Singapore, the branch at Paragon is easily my favourite. The prawn fried rice is amazingly good and so is their pork dumplings, prawn dumplings, custard bun and vegetables. Our favourite go-to place in Singapore to have a happy meal
5
This branch is located on the lower level of Paragon Shopping Center. The dining area is clean and spacious. There were 8 of us. We were promptly greeted and given a table in a private room.The wait staff was very pleasant and patient. He took his time explaining the menu and made recommendations on dishes to order and portions.All the dishes were excellent- well prepared, flavorful and fresh. We also ordered different desserts- mango pudding and birds nest were the best.If going for lunch, get there early, around 11am before it gets busy.
4
The din tai fung experience is everywhere the same, busy, waiting, pot of tea and then some delicious dim sum, Singapore dtf was no else. Only the type of dim sum varies from city to city.Paragon branch was like the chinese versions, very good, especially the truffel dim sum
5
I love Din Tai Fung (I'm French), and so do all my friends and family who come visit me in Singapore - in fact, during their short stay in Singapore they always want to go back to this restaurant rather than trying out new places.My favourites:- pork dumplings- chili oil dumplings (barely spicy - I can't take spicy food)- vegetable wanton soup- fried rice with pork- peanut coconut ball for deser
3
The crowds have thinned at the Paragon outlet and I can see why. On a Fri lunch, I could get a table within 2 minutes. Haven't seen that happen in a while. They have put on a "premium" menu to milk this expensive outlet, and it showed - a lunch for two, without drinks, came to $83! Food remains good but not as good as before; plus the place has a lot of competition now
4
During my 5-day stay in Singapore, I was introduced to this gem of a place by my friends. Within one hour of our dinner time there, the four of us had devoured some scrumptious Steamed Pork Dumplings, Deep-fried Specially Marinated Pork Chops, Stir-fried Hong Kong Kailan with Special Sauce, amid other Oriental delicacies. What stands out about this place is the quality of food and the value for money
4
very easy to go this restaurant is in the very popular street ' orchard road' and also inside popular shopping mall this restaurant there's lots of menu that you can choose rice, noodle, dim sum and many things if you are looking for the good restaurant. I recommened this one
5
Yes we have Din Tai Fung in Australia now but its not as good as this. The menu is much bigger and the quality is higher. Still a favourite to visit when in Singapore.
4
Weekly visits at Din Tai Fung, some of the best dim sums in Singapore on a daily basis. Go for pork dumplings, fried rice, truffle dumplings,...Try the new creations as well.
3
While the service was quick and efficient, I felt the food was not up to the standards I'm used to for a Din Tai Fung. I'll chalk it up to a bad day, but certainly wasn't as good as I've had at other properties.
5
As another reviewer said, I wouldn't pick this for a romantic date night, but if the way to your partner's heart is through his/her stomach, consider Din Tai Fung anyway. The food is awesome, and freshly made in plain sight. If you arrive at a busy time, there is a wait for a table (listen very carefully for them to call your number), which gives you time to look at the billboard menu pictures and create a plan of attack. Accept the fact that dishes will arrive in no particular order or schedule. Skip the beer and vegetable-fruit juice (oy! too weird!) and stick to the $1 bottomless hot tea. Savour the duck and spring onion in crispy wrapper, the truffle dumplings, the mushroom dumplings, the vegetable dumplings, the yam steamed bun (think purple sweet yam, not that orange thing Americans serve at Thanksgiving), the pork fried rice, and then realize oh Lord you have over-faced yourself. But you will roll out of there happy and fulfilled and over $70 poorer. You could pay $40 for two if you stick with the tea and order only enough food for normal human beings. Best to bring a bigger crowd to share. We ate later at the Marina Bay Sands branch of Din Tai Fung: my impression is it had less choice than the Paragon branch
4
We ate here wanting to try dumplings and buns as you can watch the chefs cooking everything fresh through a viewing window. Food tasted excellent and was served very quickly. Unfortunately the staff struggled to understand at times but tried their best to help. Would definitely recommend though due to location, cleanliness and food quality
4
Went there to celebrate the birthdays of both my grandchildren yesterday April 05, 2016Well laid out and good service as long as they get the order right!It's better to communicate using the order form.It's difficult to explain which item to bring first, second and third
5
Wow. Just the greatest dumplings I've ever had. Plus they now do a hot and sour soup that is to die for. Language barrier has now gone. Everything made fresh I front of you. Little wonder it is so good. Don't go though because you might stop me getting a table!!!!
4
Din Tai Fung does mainly Taiwanese steamed dumplings, which are very soft and stuffed with a flavourful broth - so you need to pop them whole in your mouth, and that after they have cooled slighty! They are very tasty, yet different from Chinese dim sum, though some dim sum is also served here. They also serve some other dishes - I like the dao miao, which are extremely tender and green pea shoots sauteed in garlic - healthy and delicious. The place is a simple restaurant with plain wood tables and chairs, and the service is prompt. It can get very busy at peak hours, with a long waiting line. There is a glassed-in kitchen which you can look into to watch how it's all made. DTF is one of my staple go-tos in Singapore for dependably tasty and light food
3
I love the food in Din Tai Fung! It's probably one of the best Chinese restaurant. I have no complaints with the food. I just have a problem with their service. Most of their servers cannot understand English so it's really hard to ask them for suggestions and requests. We ordered fried food but it took them 40minutes. The rest of our food arrived already and we already ate it. So the waiting for the rest of our food took forever. We decided to cancel it but they couldn't understand what we wanted which was frustrating already but I somehow understand because of the language barrier. They keep saying it will arrive in 6 minutes. Turns out 6 minutes turned into another 20 minutes which made my family and I furious. I suggest that if you eat here, which i suggest that you do because they really have good food, that you don't have a tight schedule. It might take forever.

This is one of few very successful Chinese (Shanghainese) Food chains... Din Tai Fung. And over the years, this restaurant chain has grown wide and available regionally as well. Within Singapore, it has retained good quality levels across all outlets, giving me a satisfying meal on each visit, and beating Crystal Jade chain in my view. And while it is obviously more difficult to retain the same quality overseas, they had done a pretty good job when I visited Indonesia (except the one at Alam Sutera which was not quite the equivalent to other outlets).Service wise is good, although we need to be understanding during peak hours. Food choices :Must try are their infamous dumplings. Even my ex-boss makes it a point to eat them each time he visits Singapore. There are several varieties, but they are all good so pick the filling you like. Just remember to dunk it heavily in the vinegar and eat it with some ginger.. Caution : There is soup in the dumplings so it is hot.. do beware when you pick it up from the basket so as not to puncture and leak the soup out, but also take care when you bite it as it'd still be very hot. There are dishes to choose, like appetizer salad/beancurd, etc... and seafood like fish, prawns, etc... and meats like pork or beef and chicken.Noodle choices aplenty as well, whether you prefer soup-based or dry version with sauce. I usually pick the peanut sauce based (dan-dan mian) that suits any mood and appetite, accompanied with wantons in spicy sauce and vinegar
5
Whenever we arrive in Singapore this is the first place we visit. The food is amazing and service is prompt. The pork dumplings are out of this world and the simple fried rice with egg is just delicious. Love this place!
4
Easy options if you're after dumplings. Service is good and easy to order. Expect queues during the day on weekends, but it's not too bad mid week at night.
5
Enjoyed our second trip to Din Tai Fung during our week in Singapore (first trip was to a different branch). This one is at the basement of a shopping centre, so you don't choose it for the location or view. It was very busy when we went for a light dinner, and you get in a queue to be given a number to wait outside for a table. You are also given a menu and pen whilst you wait, so you can get your food order ready. Once your table is ready, they seat you and submit your food order which comes out approximately 15 minutes later. Definitely order the pork dumplings (their specialty). We also enjoyed the chilli crab bun and the wontons in oriental sauce.

Traditional Japanese restaurant in a Food Court. Unfortunately the food is good, the place you have to stay is really bad (it is a food court in the basement). However, you go there for lunch or dinner, not to watch the people or view. The staff is not so friendly, sometimes you have the feeling of mass-production
4
I had a recent craving for Din Tai Fung so my family headed there for lunch. The food was great, though just standard Chinese food. The fried rice was probably my favorite - not too much salt and with just the right amount of topping. The vegetables were also very tasty, though the custard buns weren't to my liking. Their pork dumplings with soup were good as usual. Though the food isn't absolutely amazing, I did enjoy the food and my craving has been satisfied
5
The food was nice and the service was good. The restaurant seems too be very busy during lunch time, and the staff were able to take care of all the dining guests which is not easy and really excellent. The lighting make the big difference to the restaurant as it has the luxury appearance. It is a good place to revisit
4
Although the atmosphere is a bit canteen like the food certainly isn't: high quality Dim Sum and the like freshly prepared on site by gowned, capped and masked operatives who could perhaps have easily done a turn at the nearest Operating Theatre though I don't think your average brain surgeon waits table! Good value for the quality.At this juncture I must disagree with my late father for the first time in my very long drinking career! He always said that there is no such thing as a bad beer it's just that some are better than others. The Taiwanese beer served at Din Tai Fung can only be categorised as vile or was it that somebody had mistakenly bottled another liquid of a similar colour?
5
Was hesitant to go have dim sum solo- but was craving it and it was recommended by the concierge at my hotel. I was seated within 2 minutes and was served tea right away. Made my selections (ordered too much food) and food was delivered in an orderly fashion (not all at once). Everything was wonderful. Would recommend.
5
very busy restauranti think we had only 30 minute to get lunch permission because they were so full tables and long traffic very organized restaurant but a lil bit cold service for the staffi think they like to get hurry us and some of them a lil bit rudebut for the food it is still reccomended if u like fine chinese foo
5
I have eaten in this restaurant twice: once in March 2015, and latterly on 12 March 2016. On both occasions, I have been with my little granddaughters. The restaurant is hugely popular, with long queues waiting for access. The front desk copes with this with good cheer and great efficiency. The system for ordering a meal is simple, and the waiting staff are cheerful, competent and prompt.The food is not complicated, but it is absolutely delicious. The subtle tastes are exquisite. I will return to the restaurant on my next visit to Singapor
5
This place has been always our favourite place to it. Love every visit because of the good service, good food and ambience. Will always recommend this to our friends and family! All the best!
4
We loved the different dumplings and buns. Specially the Steamed Truffle & Pork Dumplings and the Steamed Sesame Buns. If you like dumpling you can not miss this place. We have dumplings and buns for two and payed about 50-60SGD
5
My family and I. We delighted a delicious lunch at your place last week.
Service was efficient, fast, pro and clear.
Food was absolutely amazing, original and delicious.
We keep a lovely experience
Definitely highly recommended from us.
Congratulations
Cheers

Food is consistent in quality and quantity time and time again. Service is professional and prompt and I'm sure the management would be equally good in assembly line manufacturing! Kids can't get enough of it...menu price did go up recently.

I have often observed my friends making a quick association for a particular restaurant chain in Singapore as one of the Top 10 Gourmet Restaurants in the World (as ranked by an US newspaper in 1993) whenever its name was mentioned in conversation. And that some of its outlets have been awarded Michelin-stars, some referring to its signature soup pork-dumplings ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs greatest dumplings‚Äù. Oftentimes, this would turn out to be over-simplistic generalizations.While Din Tai Fung is most famous for its soup pork-dumplings (Xiao-Long-Bao), it nevertheless also offers a wide menu with noodles, fried rice, buns, soups and salads etc.So, when my friend and I met the at nex outlet on 12 Mar 2016 for lunch, we ordered the Steamed Soup Pork-Dumplings, Oriental Wanton, Pork-Chop Fried-Rice and Braised-Beef Noodle; all nicely-priced popular items on the menu: the latter two constituting hearty meals on their own. The dumplings were satisfactory in taste and texture. Free-flowing hot jasmine tea @ $1 per pax was considered lower-priced than those charged by comparable operators.In my few previous visits to Din Tai Fung in SG, I have found the staff to be thoroughly clockwork-efficient; and eloquent, language-proficient and business-like in their service; nevertheless also exuding a tinge of bossy, cold and clinical attitude. I suspect the mostly foreign-talent staff could not do very much to dispel or change this impression.Admittedly, the ambience and setting were clean and comfortable with a modernistic design, and would be ideal choices for meeting up with friends without being distracted or hassled somewhat. I anticipate that I would stick to my preferred option of placing take-away orders for my favourite vegetarian vegetable dumplings instead
5
Whenever I am in Singapore, I always make sure to go to a branch of this restaurant. It is always delicious and the dim sum is piping hot....make sure you don't burn your mouth. This one is located on the lower level of Paragon, so after a day of shopping, make sure to stop here. There is usually always a line during lunch and dinner time. Make sure to get your order ready (before you sit down) to save time when you get to the table
5
Have eaten here at Din Tai Fung Paragon often, and everything, the food, the service, the cleanliness has all been superlative, and I'm sure several others have written about these. I wanted to highlight their customer service, and I call back I received. Once on being surprised at the price of one of their rare desserts, I had given their customer service some feedback - about how to a non-Chinese heritage person, the price of an exotic dish should be made known (because it's about 3 times the price of their most famous dish), because everyone may not know from the name itself on how exotic/rare this dish is. I have to say I admire Din Tai Fung even more now at the way they handled this feedback. I got a personal call back, the customer care heard my feedback very nicely, and said they would follow up ensuring the servers are trained to keep these points in mind. Later I even got a text thanking me, and letting me know they've benefitted from the feedback. I appreciated their response, and it shows how they're excellent at everything they do
5
We come here at least once every 2-3 weeks. Ambiance not spectacular, but the food is something special. Recommend:Oriental saladas starter. Flavors most westerners like but are not used to. Explore this onePork belly with spicy sauce. Not too spicy and deliciousPork dumplings. Need to.try. together with the ginger and vinegar. Make sure you don't break them, because the soup is delicious. For the rest try and find what you like.It's an experience and not that expensive for the Singapore diamond scene. Don't go here for a romantic dinner.
5
We decided one evening to just go for a wander along Orchard Road. We didn't really have any specific plans for dinner, but I had Din Tai Fung in the back of my mind if we ended up near the Paragon shopping complex. We came upon it about 9.15pm in the evening, which turned out to be a great time as we didn't have to wait for a table. We were seated straight away and advised that last orders were at 9.30pm, so once we placed our order we wouldn't be able to order anything further after that if we wanted to. Needless to say, we over-ordered! We ordered the fried pork chop and rice, which was delicious, the pork chop was lovely and moist. We also ordered some wantons, my husband said the prawn ones were fantastic (I don't eat seafood). We ordered the chicken and pork dumplings and the pork buns too! For what was a lot of food, and a couple of drinks, our bill only came to just over S$70, which we felt was pretty good value. Everything was delicious, and I would highly recommend eating here when in Singapore
5
Although I went alone this place is great for larger groups and families.I went during lunch time on a weekday and you line up at a cashier where you're given a number and a clipboard with a copy of the menu to mark your order. Your number is called up and you hand in your clipboard. You are then seated inside.I got the wrapped duck spring roll (it's in the appetiser section sorry I can't remember the exact name), the shrimp dumplings and braised beef noodle soup. The latter two were AMAZING and I highly recommend but the duck was a little too greasy for my taste (although yummy too). Totally recommend a visit to this place if you're looking for something laid back and casual :
5
Din tai fung is for sure one of the best casual dim sum places in Singapore with very stable food quality. Never been disappointed.
5
Din tai fung has always been my favourite restaurant to go to. I love the xiao long baos, the noodles with special sauce and the dou Miao with garlic!
5
Fun place to visit but save some time for the wait to get in. The food is worth it nice selection and everything is quickly prepared and deliciously fresh
4
Din Tai Fung was No 1 Xiao Long Pao restuarant in Singapore. It is still No 1. A Part from original menu, I notices that there were some new menu as well. For example,Noodle Soup with Fried Pork Chop which was new to me. Very Good
5
Having years ago been introduced by a Singaporean friend to Din Tai Fung, I have returned on every visit. The only place I know that can do a dim sum with a delicious liquid sauce inside - the steamed pork dumplings (their signature dish). The dim sum is magnificent (try several kinds including the shrimp) as are the custard buns. I think this must be the original restaurant - now two others in Marina Bay and one in Bangkok that I know of. None as good as this one
5
we were told we need to try the dumplings here! We did and we were not disappointed! The soup inside the pork dumplings was yummy and even my youngest ate with glee! We tried the heavier bread dumplings and spicier ones as well. All were very good. The vegetarian salad was good and so was the spinach salad. Everything came out hot and fresh. Highly recommend a visit to one off their locations!! Be prepared to wait
4
Good food, good service. Price had gone up slightly but I think is is unavoidable due to inflation. There is always a queue to the restauarant during meals hours. The waitress will always tell you a longer waiting time for the tables and maybe that you also have to wait for your food. During Chinese new year this year, the waitress told me that there is a waiting time of 45 minutes for my food after I get my table. They even write a big 45 and circle it on my order chit. But appetizer came in less than 5 mins and all the food is served within 15 to 20 mins. My favourites are the appetizer dishes here which are small portions which means I can order quite a few variaties
4
Many reviews of this Michelin rated chain - there is a reason for this. Die Die must try - the regular dumplings (Shrimp/Port/Vegetarian) but i particularly like the Chicken ones - something slightly different.Shrimp/Egg fried rice is also great.Try the Sui Mai as well whilst washing down with some tea.Not the cheapest place in town but well worth a visit
5
My cravings for xiao long bao is always satiated after a hearty meal at Din Tai Fung. The shop at Paragon is a bit small making it an excellent choice as it feels more intimate. The staff here are also more helpful compared to other branches
4
Always a solid (and expensive) choice for dumplings. All the dumplings were good, but the veggie dish was really outstanding. It was cooked but still very crisp of freshness, a very hard thing to achieve in cooking. For all that haven't had Din Tai Fung, do yourself a favor and head there early, because it WILL be packed
4
Nice dim sum and other chinese food , nice pork dumpling / buns and chicken fried rice also nice soup . Little bit expensive but worth it for the taste
3
Being Chinese, this place rocks with their simple fare. Nice environment in paragon but the waiting time is a killer so please plan in advance to wait.
Try the pork cutlet and dumplings for sure
4
I like the variety of food they offer and the fast and professional service. Must have is the "Noodles in special sauce", some dumplings and a fresh lemonade.
3
their food variety is not as many compare to other chinese restaurant. the bun was ok but not that fantastic. their food quality was quite good though as in using the good quality rice or noodle.
4
The place is great and fascinating. Always a long queue around dinner time (5-7.30) so be prepared for some waiting time (10-15 mins.. the place is big and efficient). You will be deciding from the "fill out your self" forms which is also the menu when your waiting in line, and order when its your turn to be seated. The whole process is very efficient and nice for weekday dinners when you just want to grab some delicious chinese food. And yes, its delicious.. the food is great, especially the dumplings, which is their specialty. Price-level is ok to be central location on orchard and high quality food
4
You need to go in with an open mind when you first visit DTF. When busy (which is frequently) you go into a bizarre queuing system where you are handed a paper order form and advised of your approx seating time and food service time. In most cases, this is conservative, and you get seated and served much quicker.Once you navigate these systems (which actually do improve waiting times) the food served is fantastic. We went twice on our Singapore trip - loved it both times. Steamed dumplings are the specialty - especially the Xiao Long Bao. Highly recommend for a tasty and trippy experience. Ton
5
Just like the Din Tai Fung restaurants in other cities, this one lives up to its promise. Meticulous preparation and clean facilities are evident in the glass window that shows the kitchen workers creating dumplings and cutting vegetables and other ingredients. The shop is in the basement level of Paragon along with other restaurants. Service is quick and polite. The food was tasty. Try the Rozelle drink - very tangy and refreshing
5
First time I've been, as there is always such a long line. Was early this time and tried it. Wonderful food and pleasant surroundings. When I left, I noticed that the NY Times had once declared it one of the best ten restaurants in the world. Makes sense.
5
Omg- this place is amazing, and confusing. You get a little workbook basically when you request a table and check off all the different dumplings and sides you want. We had multiple greens, fried rice, pork, pork and shrimp and pork and vegetable and dumplings and every single one was delicious. The whole place is an experience- highly recommended
4
We ordered the steamed pork dumpling and shrimp/pork dumpling. The taste of steamed pork dumpling may be 50% level of their Taipei headquarter. The stuff must practice more to make the inside of dumpling softer instead of hard.The shrimp/pork dumpling was OK.The service was good
4
Every time I stay in SG that restaurant is one of my regular place to go for dinner . Luv their noodle and the mood .
5
Delicious Asian food. Prepared fresh as you place your order. Michelin Guide is hoping to grant stars to this branch who is in fact recognised in New York as the best Asian fusion food fast food restaurant / take away
4
Regularly have lunch here.
Great value and very tasty food, dumplings and spicy soup are delicious while service is always quick, efficient and polite.
4
Always go for their prawn cake, they maintains their food standard very well with simple ambiance, fast service even the restaurant could be very packed sometimes
4
extremely famous in it's own right, DTF has a fantastic selection of dumplings, dim sum, steamed buns, etc. the choice is very extensive and there's something for every palate. branches all over but the Paragon one is where we always go
5
We decided to go native and try the local food. Whilst visiting the huge paragon center in Orchard street we came across this fine establishment and were very surprised at the quality and cost of the food.We had the shrimp soup and dim sung which was excellent.Take a tip and go for it
3
Still on the hunt for the best Xiao Long Bao (and generally in love with dim sums) i keep trying various dim sum places when traveling. Din Tai Fung has a world reputation for XLB so after to previously disappointed visits to their restaurants - in Hong King and the US - it was one last attempt at trying to understand what the fuzz is about.Now, dim sums are good - no more, no less at at any random dim sum place you can stop by. XLB have a very nice filling but not enough liquid and, more importantly, very elastic and quite unpleasant dough. Do not get me wrong, they look perfect, are served fast l and in grand variation of fillings and you can even watch preparation process through a glass wall but they are clearly not special enough to justify a 30mins wait
4
We had chosen paragon branch as it has special menu serving more vegetarian dishes. The atmosphere in the restaurant is good and nice tea was served. The food is delicious especially the vegetarian mushroom "xiao long bao" with truffle oil, refreshing marinated bittergourd, deep fried handmade doufu, steamed custard bun and crispy yam paste spring rolls. The serving size is ok for two person and we truly enjoy our lunch there
4
Had gone there just before the serpentine queues started before lunchtime!we were served endless cups of green tea....and had chicken dumplings as a starter.....v nice.....the spicy pork dumplings were really good....paired with greens and the egg fried rice......service was slow ....we did not mind as the food was yumm
5
We turned up on a Thursday lunchtime without any booking and it was busy but we were able to place our order as we waited so the food came quickly when we sat down.My wife and I shared...Chicken dumplings - they were immenseShrimp dumplings which Were also goodFried rice with pork which was fresh and tasty without being too oily and to finish we had three sweet red bean dumplings, with two soft drinks it costs √Ç¬£26 gbp which is very reasonable we thought.Would frequent often if I lived in Singapore
5
This is an amazing place, location is good in Orchard area. 11am is a good time to visit there are no queues at that time. Service and cleanliness is top class and food awesome.
5
Love this din tai fung's dumpling & the salad, also the fried rice. So yummy :)
Location are good as we always go to paragon if we stay in singapore.
5
My favorite Asian restaurant. I go as often as possible. The service is average with many wait staff often being very rude and short with customers, but I see it as being part of the experience. The food is 10/10.
3
I prefer Din Tai Fung in Taipei. Their dumplings are better. They also have other small dishes which are nice like the fried promfret with gravy.
Singapore branches are average.
Don't understand why some reader rate this as a dim sum restaurant ...
4
If you want to have the best dim sum in town go here! The food is mouthwatering. The staff could be a bit more friendly and please get rid of the "beep" at the cashier, it can be heard at the table and is highly annoying
4
Din Tai Fung is my favorite branch for Dimsum, every where i travel, i try to to go to one of those.The Din Tai fung in Paragon is always busy but their service is always good. The food is great as usual, they keep their original recipes.A must if you are in Singapore
4
This restaurant is definitely worth the wait, the service and staff are great. They make the most amazing pork dumplings I have ever tasted. Tea is served as soon as you sit down, however they charged us $1 for it without our knowledge, nonetheless the Xiao Long Bao was delightful and the prices are very reasonable. Definitely a must try
5
Yep it's all about the dumpling. This is a chain that crops up, not just in Singapore but other Asian destinations too. They are definitely the best I've ever had. We ended up ordering twice as much but oh it was soooooo good. They are constantly filling up your cup with jasmine tea which was also delicious and you can watch them making your little bundles of delight in the central, open kitchen. We waited 15 mins for a table but it was so worth it.
5
I've had Dim Sum in many places around the world, and as you would expect, it's best in Chinese areas, be it China, Taiwan or Singapore. This restaurant with its roots in Taiwan, serves Dim Sum above and beyond anything I've eaten before. We were a group of six adults and three kids, and we ate, ate and ate, and then some. Expect long queues, it's a popular place, and apparently they don't accept reservations on Sundays, but it's worth the wait
3
After eating at a sister restaurant in Taipei, the service at this Singaporean Din Tai Fung was a let down. Tea was served before we arrived at our table, and the wait staff was inattentive. However, the Xiao Long Bao was still great.Xiao Long Bao is the specialty here, and they come in 5 or 10 per basket. Go for the 10, and get a few baskets since each xioa long bao is merely a (Chinese soup) spoonful. The noodles are also great as are the vegetables.Looking solely at the food, we really enjoy eating at Din Tai Fung. Its a must to eat the Xiao long bao
5
Probably the best dim sum I've had to date. Great watching the cooks working through the glass to the Kitchen.
Attentive and proffecional staff.
Sadly they do not offer table reservations, so make sure you show up early.
5
Busy, buzzy restaurant with delicious freshly made dim sum at a great price. Would recommend without hesitation. We will be back!
4
The food is always fresh and delicious. We go every time we go to Singapore. It's a consistent restaurant that is great for families.
4
Always a queue (sign of popularity) but efficient staff mean you can order while waiting and food arrives at your table as if by magic when you go in. Constantly refresh your cup of tea throughout the meal.
4
Din Tai Fung has a standard and a reputation to upkeep. Every outlet is consistently good. This one is no different, despite being very busy during lunch and dinner timings.
Must try the Xiao Long Bao!
5
This restaurant simply has the best ever xiao long bao. I have tried many many other different restaurants in singapore but nothing compares to din tai fung. I also love their beef soup the broth is just simply amazing. If you're looking for some really amazing food that will revolutionize your tastebuds, this is the place for you. What they lack in service, they most certainly make up in the quality of their food. This is not a fancy restaurant and definitely not suitable for a romantic dinner date. But it doesn't need to be, it doesn't want to be. Customers that come here, come here simply for one thing: thier xiao long bao. So don't expect any good quality service
4
The service is polite and efficient and the dim sum is fabulous. It is a bit impersonal, but the food more than makes up for this. This is definitely one of the best dim sum places in Singapore! Be aware that you cannot order a table, so you need to show up and expect to wait around 30min before you get seated.
5
This place came highly recommended by locals, and we went to check it out. With typical Asian efficiency, we used some of our time waiting for our table preordering off a chart and an order sheet. We handed this in once we enter, and were shown to our table. The food arrived quickly. The dumplings were amazing as well as the fresh vegetables, hot and sour soup, and beef noodle soup. The final price was quite seasonable considering how much we ordered. Would definitely come back again
5
Din Tai Fung (at any of their several outlets) are exceptionally good value. The food is excellent and fast. The price is reasonable by Singapore standards. The tourist factor is good as you can watch the food being prepared by hand as the kitchen is a glassed in room in the middle of the restaurant. I thoroughly enjoy eating at Din Tai Fung and will miss them now I have moved away from Singapor
5
We ate dinner at this underground mall restaurant and was pleasantly surprised. The Dim Sim and Soup were of exceptional quality. The service was very good and the menu had a vast array to choose from. Everything was prepared fresh and served in a timely manor. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore
5
Very busy location but food is excellent! Nice that you have a chance to fill our your choices while you wait for a table to free up. Xialongbao excellent. Spinach with garlic also excellent. Busy but they don't rush you through the meal.
5
Yummy food, good quick service. It was great to see the dumplings being made onsite through to the kitchen window. You can't get any fresher than that.
4
We love this hygiene service from the stuff .
Food is great. Love the cooking demo too. Staffs are friendly.
3
Go for dumplings and the chicken soup. The flavor is okay, but nothing special. There are better options for Chinese dining in Singapore.
4
Nice and decent Chinese cuisine. Consistent taste and flavors as with other outlets. Definitely a place to consider for your meals.
5
My love affair with Din Tai Fung started right from 2006 since I started frquenting Singapore and Hong Kong for work... needless to say...no trip would conclude without a customary visit here. Whats even more outstanding is that in every of the over one dozen visits I manage to find something here that lingers on beckoning you for the next visit.This time ot was the chilli filled with meat sorru cant recall the name and the mango pudding...to die forThe dimsums are the best period
5
I found this New York times top 10 restaurant more than 10 years ago, and it is the first restaurant I come to in Singapore. The dumplings are sublime, the dough wrappers with a lovely mouth feel and the fillings - lets see 3 more days here it opens at 11:00 am that's lunch/ dinner a few more times. Grandsons (12 & 10) are hooked
5
We visited Din Tai on a busy weeknght and got in with no waiting. (It was after 8 pm). It is located on the ground floor of the mall in a back corner. We ordered several different steamed buns including the pork with truffles, pork and shrimp dumplings and hot and sour soup. It rapidly vanished after it was speedily delivered by our waiter who had a huge stack of bamboo steamer boxes. The prices were very affordable. Worth a rerun
4
Have breakfast with some church friends every other weeks.We normally order siao long Bao, noodle with minced pork in bean sauce, oriental salad in special vinegar dressing, deep fried prawn with beancurb skin, stew tafu with black fungus and peanut.Friends love the food there, we normally arrive at around 10 plus in the morning which is not so crowded. Love this outlet. Good foods
5
Possible the lightest and tastiest dumpling I have ever eaten. This restaurant (or any of the many Din Tai Fung that have popped up over Singapore) is always one of my first ports of call in Singapore. Dumplings are made fresh to order. Very popular so be prepared to wait during peak meal times.The new Pork and truffle dumpling is like being in Florence in Asia!
4
The dumplings here are so delicate and delicious. The pork buns are terrific too. We had to really search for this place in a mall in Singapore, but it was worth the search.
4
Stopped for a quick bite here. Staff friendly welcoming and helpful. food freshly made and quickly served. Reasonable pricing too. Free flowing jasmine tea. Really enjoyed it.
5
It is affordable. Food is amazing and they are super efficient. Expect long waiting time not cuz they are slow but it's just very popular! Come early grab a ticket window shop and slurp on wonderful dim sums and delights. Simple and easy!
5
 When in Singapore, we always look forward to visit DIN TAI FUNG RESTAURANT. First week of November, upon reaching Sentosa, we dropped our baggage at the hotel, and hurried to Resort World to eat at this restaurant. To our dismay, DIN TAI FUNG was closed " for renovation". We went back that night to the hotel disappointed, but determined to find one the next day. On day 2, after enjoying some shows, and shoppings at RW, we took 2 taxicabs to THE SHOPPERS at Marina Bay Sands to dine at DIN TAI FUNG located at the ground floor of the mall. It was only about 4:30 pm. I bet we were very early for dinner as there was no usual queue of waiting customers outside. The restaurant was so clean and well lighted. The chefs who also served the orders were in white uniforms, white caps and white masks. In the glass kitchen, some chefs were preparing their famous dumplings and placing them on bamboo steamers. We ordered a variety of dish: pork, chicken soup, beef noodles, veggies, fried rice and the succulent dumplings. While waiting for our order, the lady order taker, served a pinch of julienned ginger on each of the 6 small saucers. I could not describe what we ordered because every dish is in numbers. All I could remember was: all were delicious that we opted for a second serving. We vowed to return the next day.  At day 3, we went to dine again AT DIN TAI FUNG, but this time, at the basement of PARAGON Bldg, Orchard Road. Again, the restaurant was clean, newly renovated, and neat,- -no clutter. In addition, we felt welcome by the courteous MR. THAM YEW CHO. He was friendly and accommodating. To our delight, he gave us a bowl, not a pinch, of julienned ginger. We had the same order, but more of the famous chicken soup and "siao long pao". I enjoyed the chicken soup. My husband said, the liquid ( juice ) of the chicken soup is the result of long hours of steaming and is very healthy ( and medicinal). My family, especially my grandsons, loved and enjoyed pinching these dumplings and slurping the juices. When we fly again to Singapore, DIN TAI FUNG PARAGON, with the mouthwatering siao long pao and Mr. Tham Yew Cho , will be the first in our itineraries
4
A regular visitor of Din Tai Fung in Shanghai, we visited this location a couple of times during our trip. The menu is very similar with all your favourities. Very good quality food, which you pay a little extra for, but is generally worthwhile. Some interesting differences in flavour between the different regioanl location
4
This is a well-known chain restaurant. We were there early enough to avoid a long line to get in. By the time we left the restaurant was completely full. We got there around 7, which was fine with no waiting. The dim sum was excellent, especially the sweet ones, which I had not tried before. The sesame bun, and peanut bun were tasty and not too sweet. Every dumpling and bun we tried was very good.
5
My husband and I are not ashamed to say that we ate here 4 times on a 6 day business trip in Singapore. We just couldn't get enough. I'm excited to eat here again on my next trip. It's a no-brainer, just go here. Everything is well priced too for the quality, and everything on the menu is perfection
4
It was my first time to dine here at Din Tai Fung and also my first time to try Hainanese chicken and to my surprise it was really good. Although it's a little bit pricey but the food was really good. One thing that I didn't like was the language barrier because the attendant didn't quite understand me. She offered me water and I thought it was free, it turned out to cost almost $1 just for a glass of water. I would just like to remind foodies out there that water is not free in Din Tai Fung
5
I am officially addicted to DTF, I have tried all the restaurants around Singapore and I must say that Paragon holds a special place in my heart... There is not much to say, except that Din Tai FUNG IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST!!! I must visit at least once a week
4
Our family favourite restaurant, our passion started when we lived in Singapore and our daughter discovered this chain in Paragon Shopping Centre. The passion has not subsided and now we can enjoy our favourite in Australia. We always return to the scene of the initial passion whenever we can as you cannot replace the original
4
We always enjoy this restaurant. The food is freshly made, the service is quick, and the price is reasonable. No disappointments here. Try the cucumber with chili starter!
5
We just love the dim sums... if we had our way, we would just live out of this place. The service is great...
5
This restaurant redefines the concept of "bustling"! I visited with friends who know the place, and who took control of the ordering, which was good. the dishes arrive in a completely random order, so don't expect logic. do however expect delicious food!
4
This place is great if you want good oriental cuisine. I had the famous dumplings, which were very delicate and absolutely tasty. Avoid the lunch time rush if you can, it does get quite busy.
4
We are regulars here, preferring it to the Wisma Atria branch where the Chicken dumplings finish early on weekends. Expect a waiting time of at least 20 minutes on weekends. The Chicken dumplings are great -- tender and juicy. The vegetable dumplings get a little chewy if you leave them for a while. Do ask the servers to make sure that you get food without beef and pork if you do not eat these
1
Had a very unpleasant dining experience last night at the Paragon outlet. Although the food was decent, the service was downright appalling.The dishes that we ordered was served in a very haphazard manner. For example:1. It took the service team forever to replenish our tea and even after requesting them to do so2. One serving of noodles was served so late that the rest of the dinners in our party have almost finished our meal2 One of us ordered the fried rice and the plating leaves a lot to be desired. It loos like someone have taken a couple of mouthfuls out of the serving and attempted to disguise this by spreading the rest of the serving to hide it. See photo which was taken just as it has been put on our table.3. The vegetable was served so late that it was like having it as dessert. Again, we had to remind them that there was this outstanding order multiple times4. The last straw was that it took them 40 minutes to 35 minutes to serve dessert.5. When asked to speak to the manager to expressed our dissatisfaction, we were even more annoyed. Not a word of apology and he disappeared and never came back. What a spineless individualDIN TAI FUNG, just a gentle reminder that decent food only does not make for a pleasant dining experience. Even the best cuisine in the world can be spoilt by bad service. This is one such example except that the service that we experienced was not only bad, it was, and I repeat, downright appalling

Din Tai Fung at the swanky Paragon shopping mall is located at basement level. The low wall around the water feature at the entrance provides a welcome seat for those waiting for a free table. This is a regular situation as the restaurant is immensely popular. The wait was minimal, and we were presented with a menu beforehand. This made ordering very easy. By the time we were actually seated, all the waitress needed to do was to double check that our order was as ticked on the menu.A very handy feature at the comfortable tables was a kind of 'bassinet' that lets a lady keep her handbag away from the table and chairs. This makeshift receptacle is actually covered with a cloth after the handbag is neatly stacked away. Wonderful!The food came speedily and with absolute efficiency. The dumplings were moist, delicious and piping hot. The chili crab dumplings were to die for. Although tea is not free, one charge gives you unlimited quantities.Din Tai Fung is famous for its soup dumplings - for lovers of wet dumplings, this is a must but I personally preferred the chunky ones. The fried rice was simply heavenly - chunks of egg, seafood and meat tossed with sticky rice flavored with sesame oil. It is definitely devilishly moreish.The service is excellent. What is the main attraction of this restaurant is the glass cubicle housing the masters of dumpling making. The entire process is visible to customers, from the rolling of the dough to the deft, precise pleating of the pillowy dumpling. It is truly a sight to marvel at.Din Tai Fung is the ultimate experience for dumpling and Asian food lovers

We were so impressed with our first visit to this restaurant (On a busy Saturday lunchtime) we went back a second time for lunch prior to flying home.The seating organisation is great. We told the front of house staff how many in our party and we were given a menu with pen to fill in as we waited. We had been given a ticket number and were called within only a few minutes as our table was ready.We were provided with a little stand with a cover in which to place my hand bag and any shopping purchases we had which is a great idea to keep them off the floor (See photo).The menu options were extensive with my favourite being the dumpling soup options. All food was very tasty and satisfying. The service was friendly and helpful for a pair of tourists who had not visited the restaurant before

Din Tai Fung has been in Singapore for 12 years and they launched 12 new dishes to tie in with the milestone. I have been to Din Tai Fung many time and on this visit, I tried their new dishes. Here they are:- Black Fungus with Ginger strips in Vinegar Dressing: $5.50. I had this in Taiwan the week before when I was there for a holiday. The vinegar dressing is different from the one that I had in Taiwan. The one used here is a fruit vinegar which made it milder in taste than the one I had in Taiwan. The black fungus was crunchy and the vinegar gave it a nice tanginess. The wolfberry were plump and tasty.- Bittergourd marinated with black bean sauce: $5.50. Served chilled, the bittergourd is cut into long 0.5cm x 4cm strips. Its marinated with their house black bean sauce. I expected it to be tough to eat, but the bitterness was mild. I actually enjoyed this appetiser.- Cucumber dressed in garlic and chilli oil: $5.30. Japanese cucumbers put into 2cm pieces, and garnished with garlic and chilli oil. A simple and crunchy appetiser.- Yam paste wrapped in Crispy Spring Roll: $6.60. Popiah skin wrapped yam paste with yam strips, and rolled into ‚Äòsticks‚Äôthen deep-fried. Just hold it with your hands and eat. Its good. - Chinese Yam steeped in Umeshu and Cherry Tomato Dressing: $7.80. Chinese yam cut into long strips and steeped in umeshu (Japanese Plum wine for 12 hours, giving a nice sweet-sour tang. Its topped with a cherry tomato dressing. The taste reminds me a lot of Chinese Pear.- Deep-fried Tofu with Water Chestnuts & Mushrooms: $8.60. These were handmade. The chestnuts added a nice crunch to each bite. Its served with a sweet chilli sauce. Its nice!- Steamed Bun with Preserved Vegetables and Char Siew: $2 for 1 bun. The ‚ÄòMei Cai‚Äô preserved vegetables were mixed with a blend of pork belly and pork loin. Its tasty and the preserved ‚ÄòMei Cai‚Äô stimulated the appetite and I like it. - Steamed Assorted Mushroom Buns Infused with Truffle Oil: $2 each, $5.80 for 3. 4 kinds of mushrooms, cut up and mixed with truffle oil and stuffed into a ‚Äòbao‚Äô then steamed. Portions are good sized and will easily fill you up.- Steamed Assorted Mushroom Dumplings Infused with Truffle Oil: $16.80 for 10 pcs. The same filling as the dish above. But its wrapped in the thin xiao long bao skin (and folded 18 times to close the bao) then steamed. I love the part when I bit into the dumpling and the truffle smell hits my senses. Good!Dessert- Steamed Custard Bun: $2 each, $5.80 for 3. The bun is stamped with the word ‚ÄòFu‚Äô, which means fortune or good luck. It‚Äôs the size of a regular char siew bao, so its bigger than the ones you get at most Chinese restaurants, which means you get to eat more of a good thing! Break open the bun, and you get a sweet savoury custard oozing from within. This was finished very quickly by each member of my dining group in no time. Its good. - Double-boiled Snow Pear and Coral Seaweed with Red Dates: $7.80. This was a refreshing dessert. Served cold, the cut snow pear and coral seaweed had been double boiled with red dates. The soup is sweet. The coral seaweed is crunchy and at times, reminded me of ‚Äòsea coconut‚Äô. This dessert is ‚Äòcooling‚Äô in nature and helps with the hazy weather that we are now experiencing. Nice!- Finely Mashed Yam Paste with Pumpkin & Ginko Nuts: $5.30. This is the Teochew ‚ÄòOr Nee‚Äô dessert. There‚Äôs fine mashed yam at the bottom and its topped with mashed sweet pumpkin and ginko nuts at the top. They drizzle pandan syrup which adds sweetness to the dessert. The new items are only available at Paragon outlet. So head over here if you are looking for something new to dine at Din Tai Fung

There is a big queue to get into this place, but it moves fairly quickly. We waited about 30 minutes for a table for 2. While you wait you can fill out your chit with your order, and once seated the food arrives quite quickly. The good thing is they bring it out in batches so you don't end up with all your dishes at once, and can get through a few before they bring more. While it is a chain restaurant, the dumplings were of a very high quality and very delicious. It was good to see the cooks making them on site as well. The free tea was also a nice touch, and was regularly topped up. If you want to check out a DTF branch without a queue, then the one at Sentosa Island had no queue, but the Paragon branch had more atmosphere. The prices aren't as cheap as you can find elsewhere, but were overall good value for the taste and quantity
4
There was a great variety of Chinese dishes and constant refill of jasmine tea. Service was nice, food taste was very satisfactory and prices were really good. 2 soups, 2 main dishes and 2 starters costed us around 70 SGD.
5
Thumbs up: Polite and smiling service, tasty food, and quick serving time. Tip: During lunch and dinner times, assume average 10-15 mins waiting time.
5
I have never got bored of this restaurant. The dim sums are out of this world, unless the chef takes so much pride in making food in a mass market restaurant one cannot consistently guarantee such high quality food.
5
Been there for Brunch and have to wait about 15 minutes to get table which quite fast compare to lunch or dinner.Food are very delicious and tasty.Definitely should go to enjoy one of the best Chinese restaurant in town.
5
Can never go wrong with Din Tai Fung. The outlet at Paragon if I do recall correctly is the first Din Tai Fung in Singapore.Selected Xiao Long Bao (one with Curry Crab fillings and one with normal fillings), Fried Rice, Fried Pork Chops, Dumplings (dripped in spicy chilli oil). Cannot never go wrong with the above selection
5
You mostly have to wait a bit for a table, but you already can choose what to order later. The Dumplings are just fantastic and they have a lot of different ones. The Service is very fast and the food comes very quickly. The Ambiente is ok. Not romantic but for that you won't come here.We never had a problem with the stomach. Only because you order to much...:-
4
This v location is the first Singapore outlet of this chain from Taiwan. Operationally excellent, the queue is always managed to be tolerable. Like all branches you are given a menu to check off your order while waiting so food will arrive quickly once seated. The glassed-in " kitchen " always staffed with people making xiao long bao, their signature food, is more for show because I was told the bulk of the food comes from central kitchen. Still prices are still tolerable for a tolerable wait and good food
5
This is one of my most favourite dim sum place. Although almost always there is a long queue in front of the restaurant for patrons waiting to be seated, the queue moves quite fast. Once seated, food starts arriving with brisk pace and each and every item is superlative.This place does not have great ambience and is very noisy. But the dim sums are great and reasonably price
4
Din Tai Fung attracts a lot of hype and it is for this reason that I chose not to try the place. I sometimes wonder about on-going good publicity.But I was wrong. I should not have held back.Din Tai Fung has a wide, but fairly basic menu, and as I discovered, the chicken soup with truffles and the Xiao long bau with truffles are the highlights. They have an exceptional range of stir-fried vegetables also, some vegetables not being familiar to me. Service is in some ways regimented, but efficient, tea is free-flowing, the place has a vibe.And guess what, the next day we stopped by another Din Tai Fung for a snack, this time at the MBS complex
5
I make it a point to have dim sum irrespective of which part of the world I am at. This place is by far the best, most authentic dim sum I have tried. I had the; prawn and pork, crab meat and pork and the steam chicken dumplings and they were just amazing. The flavor is indescribable...something you just got to try / experience. In addition to which, I also had the prawn pancake and kilan in soy sauce. Both were delicious. The place as expected is extremely crowded...it's the case irrespective of the day of the week...yes, it is that popular! However, a ten min wait and you can be seated...it's a quick turn around restaurant. The place is big and the seating is extremely comfortable. It's an absolute must try!!
5
We came here for the Xiao Long Bao which never failed us. It was so good! We also tried the spicy crab buns. The ambiance is also nice, it was inside the Paragon mall.
5
Xiao Long Bao galore. I could eat here everyday. They offer other choices which were equally as good. I dream of their dumplings.
5
The best dumplings ever! I could have eaten them endlessly. So light and fresh. I also had a beef noodle dish that was scrumptious. Very inexpensive for such great food. Advice: eat at off-hours to avoid the long wait.
5
Completely and utterly moreish and amazing as usual. They always nail it and I will never visit Singapore without a proper greedy session at Din Tai Fung
5
A must do if you like dim sum, Amazing variety of steamed, fried and baked dim sum including unusual fusion dim sum such as pork and truffles. Loved it.
5
Din Tai Fung is the best Chinese I've ever had. It is by far the cleanest and most flavorful. Their soup dumplings are the best.
4
amazing dumplings. focus on those and you will never be wrong! pork and prawn dumplings are a must. stir fried dou miao with pork strips amazing!!
5
Ok I know, many people say this is a chain and some Singaporean argues that there are better Chinese restaurants for dim sum... However from my perspective i have rarely seen a place like this. I find the food amazing and incredibly cheap for Singapore. In addition this is a factory, people working at the speed of light, every dumpling is made behind an open kitchen which is nice and gives the sense of cleanliness and still delivering a very good quality.If you are in Singapore you can't miss it..
2
Having been away from Singapore for the last 2 years, Din Tai Fung was some of the food I dearly missed while being away.Having visited this branch twice in the last few days I can only conclude this place has changed for the worst. Be prepared to wait for a very long time for your food 30-40min and don't get chocked when you get the bill.While the taste is still good, I did notice inconsistencies in food served between the two visits. Getting a tea refill requires catching a waitress multiple times, whereas your cup used to be always full.Hope this will be taken into consideration, and help return this place to its past glor
5
One of the best places to indulge in the aroma of food. This restaurant hits the right note from the moment you enter it. From their friendly staff to their tasty food, everything is just perfect. I must have visited this place twice and both times the food has been awesome. From their prawn‚Äôs cake to the chicken dumplings, everything is sumptuous in taste. It‚Äôs a must visit place if you are in the vicinity
1
The best Xiao long bao in Taipei. I fully agree. But this is not as good as the one in Taipei (any branch)
4
Food consistency is the best at this outlet. It is therefore no surprise that one has to join the queue during the lunch hours!
Xiao long bao and la mian are must tries here!
5
The best Xiao Long Bao and Beef noodle soup I've ever had. The line was very long so we waited for while but it was so very worth it!
3
Very good dumplings and buns. The sauces and condiments make it more exciting.
We ordered and reordered the vegetarial dumplings
5
Ordered lemongrass juice. Very refreshing!!! Also ordered pork dumplings. One of the best in Singapore. The standard is comparable to the original one in Taiwan. However, do avoid their peak hours. You may have to wait a while for a table.
5
Excellent Taiwanese food. Make sure to order their specialty, soup dumplings! There are many kinds that are all delicious.
3
This place is like a fast food restaurant with very slow service. We were disappointed with having to wait so long (40 minutes) outside for average food. Each customer is given a menu to fill in and a number. You wait till your number is called -you sit down and your food is delivered.It is very popular however but the dumplings we thought were just OK.
5
Enjoyed my first experience at DTF Wisma Atria, so went to DTF Paragon a few days later. The lunch time queue for a table for two had a twenty minute wait, spent watching the constant movement of staff in the kitchen and restaurant. Service and food were excellent, and of similar quality to DTF Wisma Atria. The sour soup was delicious
4
It's always long Q here no matter what's day/ what's time I went there. Minimum waiting by standing outside is 30+ minutes. But it's always worth it. We loved xiao long bao the most, fried rice with pork chop is second and third is shrimp wonton soup. Tried the sticky rice wrapped not so good. Juices also not very good either a lot of syrup than real juice. If you go just order Chinese tea is best.
5
Had such a delicious lunch here that we decided to return for dinner !!! The best dumplings and wontons and spicy noodles. Love the freshness of the food and watching the chefs cook. The waiters wearing face masks a bit weird though !!Definitely visit if you are at Paragon shopping mal
4
Stumbled across this while walking through the shops just before it opened and there was a queue out the door. You will not be disappointed with the hand made dumplings and other assorted foods!
5
One of the most satisfying Chinese food. The price is reasonable, the food was fantastic. Xiao Long Bao is definitely a must. Other dish that I recommend is Fried Rice with Pork Chop. Very satisfied!
4
I like the small plates servings as I can sample more dishes. The prices are reasonable and the food tastes great. You have to queue for at least 10-15 mins. to get a table.
5
The best seafood rice you can ever get. Their dumplings are lovely bi which they had more none pork dumplings.
4
The dumplings here are one of the top eating experiences you'll ever have in your life, if you like Dim Sum. Also the fried rice - beyond amazing. Atmosphere is a little stark.
4
I like the cleanliness and you can watch the chefs preparing the dumplings. It's quite an experience and the food is delicious, if a little bit on the expensive side. Well worth a visit
4
I finally got the chance to visit the restaurant after reading many praises about it. And truth to be told, it was underwhelming. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, the price was reasonable but there was nothing so over-the-top about their food.That being said, it's still a good restaurant that you should pay a visit
5
Went here with family on our trip to Singapore and we were completely bowled over! One of the best restaurants in terms of food in Singapore! Visited for meals thrice on our 5 day visit to Singapore so that itself speaks a lot!A must visit for sure!Love their pork dumpling, the egg rice, baby pok choi stir fry, the veg salad! Drooling as I write about it
5
Oh wow. I ordered a few plates because everything looks like a small portion on the menu. It adds up. Terrific food, great service. I waddled out forty minutes later with a belly full of dumplings, veges and beer... Very content.I highly recommend any of the Din Tai Fung restaurants.
3
Been dining here for about a decade and in recent years the service standard is declining; however, the quality of the food is still on par with Din Tai Fung's standard for the most part. The issue at the restaurant is the completely unorganised procedure in food delivery where often time dessert dishes are delivered before the soup and main courses. At other times the time span between delivering one main course to another person's main course can easily exceed 10 mins. The ambience of the restaurant is average where the decor is quite good but the restaurant gets extremely noisy , exacerbated by its design. Overall the restaurant is quite good but standards are no longer as high as they once were. The restaurant is often times a hit and miss as you might be lucky to have a good lunch/dinner service or you might have a poor service. For its price though, it makes it good value for money if you can over look service issues.
5
I am a Din Tai Fung devotee, and the Paragon branch never disappoints. The food is fresh and the decor is modern and minimalist. Definitely get the noodle soup with shrimp and pork dumplings, steamed pork dumplings, fried rice with pork, and the cold seaweed salad.
5
Every time I go to Singapore, I should eat at this restaurant. I love the quick service by the staff. My must order menu are Xiao Lung Pao (the pork one), Spicy noodle, any kind of stir fry veggie, or if I feel really hungry I will order their fried rice with pork chop & Taro bun for my dessert. They never failed me and I always go to Din Tai Fung at Paragon. Tried the one in Wisma Atria and the taste weren't the same
5
Went here on Saturday morning at 10 am for Dim Sum. The food was very fresh cause made in the shop as we can see from the dinning room. The restaurant was clean (hygienic) the wait stuff were very attentive and caring. Try to come early otherwise you will have to wait for good one hour before you can get table...
5
~My son & I went for lunch just before opening at 10am Sat, weekdays it opens at 11am.~ordering via penciled forms, just match the pictures in the menu to the items on the form~the crispy prawn pancake was juicy and fluffy, fried wanton with black bean sauce virtually drained of oil, moist fried rice with pork chop is great value for money and the Xiao Long Bao die die must eat Shanghai style original meat dumplings infused with hot soup taken with vinegar and ginger :)~service is efficient and polite with a covered bag for all our shopping, first dishes arrived within 3 minutes and all our food arrived in 8 minutes~Din Tai Fung never fails to deliver delicious value for money food :

I was invited to dinner at the Din Tai Fung Restaurant in the Paragon Shopping Centre, Orchard Road. I have had Taiwanese dishes in Chinese restaurants before but this particular Taiwanese cuisine provided a most enjoyable gustatory experience. The large number of diners and queues of people waiting to be seated confirmed its popularity. Because we had booked in advance, a table was awaiting our presence. We did not have to wait long before being served. My Singaporean host obviously knew what to order and within twenty minutes a range of steamed dumplings and other dishes appeared. Dishes kept coming over the next thirty minutes until our table almost ran out of space. Anyone walking past the restaurant and seeing the piles of bamboo baskets and large number of chefs making and cooking dumplings could be forgiven for mistaking the cuisine to be Yam Cha, which originated from Hong Kong. Unlike Yam Cha restaurants, Din Tai Fung has a more extensive and different range of dishes on its menu. However, there is no doubt that a bigger range of steamed dumplings is available in Yam Cha restaurants which are orientated towards prawns, whereas Din Tai Fung√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s dumplings are pork-orientated. There are subtle differences in flavour and texture of the steamed dumplings of the two cuisines; however, they are equally sumptuous. An obvious difference in the menu of the two cuisines is the larger number of rice, noodle and hot (chilli) dishes on the Din Tai Fung menu.Between the four of us, we had several dishes, ranging from steamed dumplings, appetisers, and noodle and vegetable dishes. After gorging ourselves with the delicious food we still had leftovers which we were allowed to take away. The service was good and the waitresses were polite and happy to serve. The ambience of the restaurant was bright and happy and there were many families with children. We gave the steamed dumplings and other dishes an average score of 8 out of 10
4
We were keen to have some good dimsum and this Taiwanese franchise came highly recommended. Although they told us it would be a 20-25 minute wait, we were offered a table < 15-17min. Their queue management was efficient.It was fascinating to watch them perform their craft within the transparent kitchen and preparation area. Overall, it was a very satisfying experience
3
I am a fan of din tai fung..especially the xiao long bao.however recently when i patronised the skin of xiao long bao was harder and not as juicy as before.fortunately the fried rice with prawns maintain its standard..golden yellow rice coated with egg and fresh prawns makes a satisfying meal.the mushroom noodles is springy and flavourful.the pork chop though oily yet tender And the fried prawn paste tasted good however serving is small
5
Though there is a bizarre waiting list system (somehow our number never got called), this place is worth the wait. We ordered randomly and every single item was perfect. When you arrive you get tea and you can order other drinks with your meal but it isn't really necessary
3
Don't know what the fuss is all about. We have been here in Singapore for more than 10 years, and ever since Din Tai Fung opened their doors many years back, we would pass by the restaurants with snaking long lines. We have always been disinterested in this type of cuisine, always preferring the more celebrated Cantonese style dim-sum offerings. But last week, we decided to make the plunge to try it (even though none of us were that eager) just to satisfy our curiosity. We waited more than an hour for our turn and now we are left still wondering what the fuss is all about. Firstly, aside from xiao long baos, there's not a wide variety - the items are basically the same, just either bigger or smaller. The taste of the food was just not to our liking - ginger, vinegar, insipid fillings, bland, too much red bean in the offering. To add salt to injury, we had queued up so long for nary a hype.Give me good old dim sum anytime at Tim Ho Wan and Crystal Jade
4
Lunch time quite crowded but the queue goes fast. You take a waiting number and an ordering paper. While waiting you go through the menu and choose what you want to eat and make the remarks to the paper. While waiting some 10-15 minutes, watch chefs at work. Delicate dumplings are served steaming in bamboo baskets. You don't necessarily need to order any drinks because there is free flow of tea during the meal. We wanted anyway some ice tea. Give attention that the ice in the tea is made of not water but of ice tea itself. It's like a snow ball. Great idea. The spinach could have had better flavor, maybe just a bit more salt. Anyway restaurant is highly recommended.
5
I usually have the noodles and Xiao Long Bao which is their specialty. Not much of an ambiene in typical chinese restaurants. Basically it is eat and go.
5
Wow. This place has the most magnificent dumplings on earth. They are frresh & made in the front window. The wait to get in was about 15 mins for lunch on our visit but worth it. A MUST visit for dumplings
5
This restaurant is easy to locate in Paragon on Orchard Rd, the dumplings were outstanding and with prompt service. Being served by kitchen staff with face masks is not especially friendly, but the food was excellent.
5
Are you looking for worlds best dim sum, dumplings and wantons?
Here you will find them.
Great choice also with kids. They just adore the "ravioli"
5
I was looking for a good place to eat while in Singapore. Saw a long line just waiting to get in and I decided to wait along with everyone else. I'm glad I did the food was delicious
3
Went on a weekday for dinner, no queue and we got our seat rather fast. However, the lack of service is really turning us off. Asked for warm water and icy water was serve, when we told them we ask them to change, the waitress gave us "black face" to show her unwillingness. In addition, the duration for each dish to arrive is taking longer and longer. We ordered some steam items and fried rice. Every dish took quite some time to be served to us. As such, we got full really fast and very soon, we do not have the appetite for other dishes. Perhaps their business is too good and overrated over the years, as such, the service and quality of food are going down. ***The skin of the dim sum is getting thicker, avoid ordering
4
You may have to wait for a while. This is so popular. But there are some this restaurant around here, you should search them. As this store is convenient, it is crowded more.The taste was great of course. You can drink the Chinese tea for free. I was served all dishes so fast. I can recommend this restaurant
5
Singapore visit is not complete without a few stopovers at this legendary restaurant. The food is delicious and the service is quick. Though the wait outside the restaurant may not be as quick. At the one in sentosa we had to wait for half an hour.But it was totally worth the wait.The dimsums are to die for! The egg chicken fried rice and the tossed chinese greens are a must. Just delicious finger licking good! Great place to eat at with family
5
Having recently dined at DTF in Hong Kong, I thought I'd visit Paragon whilst on a recent business trip to Singapore - I wasn't let down. You can rely on the quality, taste, service and experience dining here. I made sure to arrive around 11.30am to guarantee a table and there was no waiting. Can't wait until Din Tai Fung opens in Melbourne
4
Firstly, I'd like to compliment the excellence service Din Tai Fung has maintain since my first visit. World class service and ability to bring out the best in simple ingredients like black fungus, minced pork and cucumber makes this restaurant a place one must visit. Three dishes I'd highly recommend are their fried rice, fried prawn roll and truffle xiao long bao. A place I'd definitely bring my family because of their excellent servic
5
I travel in Asia a lot and this is simply the best Taiwanese style dumplings and buns around. Their other dishes are also outstanding.
3
Back to DTF after many years and a last failured experience. Worth a visit for xiao long bao, but the beef noodle soup was tasteless and some other dim sum we ordered quite boring.
4
Good value and delicious. We were able to visit for dim sum after 3pm. Then for after lunch shopping is close by.
5
Must try and you will understand. The food is closer to the original DTF in Taipei. Service is good and quality of food tastes better too. Not sure why, but do book in advance.
4
Very neat clean and tidy Chinese restaurant with variety of Dimsums.The Noodles and soups were also very good worth trying though not on the top of my fav foods.Prawns and lamb were excellent.Chinese fast food with class.
5
Attended with my wife whilst in Singapore. Highly recommend as the food, service and price were good.
We ate steamed dumplings, prawn rice, fried wontons and spinach. All beautifully made and of high quality.
Would highly recommend as a great night out.
4
My first true dim sum experience. Loved every minute of it. I'm still dreaming of the chili noodles and the truffle dumplings. Pretty affordable considering how much you can get. We went pretty early on Thursday evening and there was no line. Can't wait to have again. The little pineapple cakes at the front were purchased on a whim but are incredibly delicious and a good gift for back home
5
This place is the King of Dumplings! When you're used to dumplings in America, these dumplings will forever change how you view it. It was superb! It is amazing how the soup is placed inside (we did discover the method but I won't reveal it here). Hats off to this establishment for a job well done
5
We managed to get to this place 3 times this visit and even when we were there as doors opened it was packed!The NYT says this is one of the top 10 eating places int he world YES!Dumplings made by hand, WOW.The bottomless Jasmine tea is amazing, the service amazing and the food worth the line if there is one.Yes you can wait 45 minutes at dinner time.Din Tai Fung is a place you need to go to.I love the fact that they give you a little hamper for your bags and for peanuts you can get unlimited water
5
Came here on a Sunday afternoon around 430pm and waited only 3 mins to get seated. All dishes served hot as they are ready. Highly recommend the following:Taiwan shrimp and pork oriental wantons with spicy saucePan fried shrimp and pork gyoza. Steamed pork DumplingsStir-fried Dou Miao with pork stripsThey forgot to order 2 items I asked for but it worked out for the best because I was stuffed! Best way to order is look at website ahead of time and write down what you want to. When you arrive, you can quickly fill out the order sheet and you'll receive your dishes soon after you sit down.
5
Have been 4 times over the past 3months usually go early morning on a weekend to avoid the Qs. The dumplings and noodles are consistently excellent! The staff service is prompt and efficient, with piping hot tea re-fills before your cup ever empty's. Recommended!
4
Great Food if you have the time to wait in line.
Since they are always so busy, service is not the priority in this place... so pack a lot of patience while you dine :)
4
Our family of four stumbled upon this restaurant not knowing that it was so highly regarded and Michelin star rated. We ordered multiple dumplings to share and although the wrap was delicate and very fresh tasting, the stuffing lacked flavour and needed alot of hot sauce (sate). Watching the cooks make the dumplings was interesting though.
5
One of the best dumpling places I have been to. Great Service and great food. Ambience is good. Luckily I did not have to wait for long as normally during lunch and dinner hours there is a huge wait line. But the food is worth the wait
5
I usually go to the Seattle one so when in Singapore decided to they this one out. Well the quality Control for this chain is good. This was as good as the other. Particularly, the regular pork Xiao Long Bao were great. Delicate skins and succulent pork and soup. Pleasure personified. Other dishes good as well. Can't wait to go to Taipei one soon. I hope

My wife and I are Australian (she is of Asian background) and we have eaten Din Tai Fung in several countries (including for breakfast in Malaysia!) and we always love it. Maybe people don't all consider it the best dumplings on earth, but we are never disappointed.On this occasion in Paragon we had been to India for 2 weeks prior and unfortunately on my last day there I got a tummy upset so hadn't eaten much for 48hrs by the time we got here and even though I didn't feel great I was actually starving and wanting something I was used to eating, that I knew what to expect and felt I could handle even feeling not 100% so we had steamed dumplings! You wouldn't think I was dinki di Aussie would you. My wife has trained me up well! They were delicious and really hit the spot. I didn't eat as much as I would usually, but I think Din Tai Fung actually helped me feel better! Just what the doctor ordered! Will be back in Singapore in about a month and know where I'll be having at least one meal

Taking here by a friend. Really was the best Dim Sum. Dumplings to die for, noodles were perfect and full of flavour. All brought to the table, hot and perfect. Highly recommended. Loved the little trolley they brought to put our shopping bags in and then covered it with a cloth

I heard a lot about this restaurant and always wanted to try it. I can say it has met my high expectations. The restaurant itself is quite simple with no frills. Menu is also quite simple and don't have huge variety however what they have they do well. Everything we tried were all delicious! Due to big lines and constant flow of guests the servers seem a little flustered at times and level of service was a bit inconsistent however the quality of food makes up for it.
5
Visited here up to 5 times in last two years. Every occasion and every food choice was perfect and satisfying. Perfect food perfect service. But you have to wait. Be prepared to que for 15-30minutes in peak times. But it's all worth it. And that's everyone waits. Food comes as its prepared so you don't get to choose the sequence. It's all about sharing and clockwork. My favorite choices are the veg dumplings. The chicken mince dumplings. The spicy noodles is favorite. There are many vegetarian options and all cooked with no contamination of meats. Try also the sour lime drink. Very refreshing. Give paragon Din Tai Fung a try and enjoy Chinesr good in stylish and tasty way.

Waited 45 mins to walk into a restaurant with empty filthy tables everywhere. This is terrible customer service. After 20 mins no food and still filthy tables everywhere.
5
Visited this restaurant and had to wait 45 minutes for a table but boy was it worth it. Food is simply great. The Steamed Vegetable & Pork Dumplings are juicy with delectable delightful tastes from the cabbage. Not too expensive either so for Singapore this was a bonus
4
We ordered the siao long pao, congee, yang chow rice and ribs. Love their congee, cooked very well and the siao long pao is the greatest so far. Soft and moist and full of flavor. Goes well with ginger and vinegar. I can eat here anytime! Set back only is waiting time pf the yang chow rice. Took a while to arrive but my kids love it anyway
5
We were brought here by some friends, who said it was a not-to-miss dinner when in Singapore. The dumplings were the best I've ever had, particularly their signature xiao long bao, or soup dumplings. The wrapper was so thin and delicate, yet held up to chopsticks; the filling so rich and tasty with a delicious broth that was just the right temperature. The chili crab bun was also really, really good, as were the cucumbers with chili sauce. The wontons with black vinegar and chili stole the show though - it was our last addition to our order, and we were so glad we got them. The wontons themselves were great, with the sauce took them over the top - we ended up using the sauce with everything else on the table as well
5
We go there every time we go to Singapore and every aingle time, the quality is the exact same and evety dish is just as we remember it. Always busy, great service despite how rushed the waiters and cooks must be, and they even gave complimentary glutinous rice balls with black sesame and nuts (yum) as part of the Chinese New Year celebrations. Money is always well spent there, and not too pricy. I never mind waiting (I think it adds to it)
4
We were looking for a place to dine and my friend said she had a craving for Din Tai Fung Xiao Long Bao. I agreed with her suggestion and we headed to Paragon basement as it was the nearest outlet to us. Even though it was 12.15pm, the wait was about 20 minutes before we got our table. Here are the highlights of our meal:- Xiao Long Bao: Served in a steaming basket in either an order of 6 pieces of 10 pieces. Pick a piece and dip into the dipping dish with ginger slices and vinegar. The skin is thin and gathered at the top. Bite the top off, to allow the steam within to escape before putting the rest of the dumpling in your mouth. The soup within is tasty and the dumpling is delicious.- Double-Boiled Chicken Soup: Clear soup that's been doub;e-boiled with pieces of chicken, a sice of ginger and a slice of spring onion. The soup is delicious and a little oily. The chicken was tender and fell off the bone. I ate the chicken with the chilli dip.- Sliced Duck in Crispy Green Onion Pastry: This was my first time eating this. It is a slice of smoked duck wrapped in a 'popiah skin' and deep fried. You can eat it on its own or dip it into the chilli or vinegar sauce. Crispy, tasty and delicious.- Egg Fried Rice: The rice is nicely fried with the egg and spring onions. I like the bits of egg that's fried evenly with the rice. Must order!My friend who has been to the outlet at Taipei commented that the Xiao Long Bao and Egg fried rice are similar to the one in Singapore. The greens in taipei is fresher, probably due to the proximity of the farm where the greens are produced to the restaurants. Recommended

Really yummy but only if you are a flexible vegeterian or like seafood and pork. Otherwise you'll find yourself eating desert (red bean and chocolate dumplings) and steamed greens. Typically has long queues that you can avoid if you head out late (noon is lunchtime) around 2pm.
4
Din Tai is my absolute Favourite eating joint in Singapore. The dumplings are delicious, like you can't stop eating them delicious. I found it to be good value for money considering its a Michelin Star establishment. The Egg fried rice is also great, but the stars of the restaurant are definitely their pork dumplings.
5
Went there with a couple of colleagues for dinner. The food there is to die for. 2 of us were vegetarians and we had Dumplings, dates with glutinous rice, noodles and quick fried nai bai with garlic. Each of us must have eaten 12-15 dumplings The tea served along with the food was brewed just right, which is not often the case at restaurants.The staff was helpful, and service was quick and efficient
5
ive heard so so comments about this place. Went there with a couple friends and the food was amazing and cheap. We had ,what seemed to be, a never ending supply of dim sum and veggies and they were great! Service was amazing too! Oh and you have to try to FRIED RICE! Best I've had in Singapore
4
speciality dumplings place. Quite expensive but service correct. Different locations in the city mostly in malls
5
Awesome place to eat. Cannot leave Singapore without a trip here. Open kitchen. Great everything.... cannot pick anything specific as everythimg is fantastic!
5
Very excited to find out we have Din Tai Fung in Sydney. Love the dumplings. The 35 min wait whilst long means that the food is good. And it was.
4
+: Best Xiao Long Baos as always, but ...
-: a long queue as usual! Waiting time was at least 20 mins.
-: AMEX not accepted.
4
The food was delightful, staff were friendly although little English was spoken. Service was slightly slow due to overcrowding of restaurant diners.
Would recommend the special braised beef and noodle soup, very nice!
4
This is NOT a dim sum restaurant as so many folks believe - it's a Taiwanese dumpling restaurant - where home made dumplings are their specialty - the tasty bursts of flavour which burst in your mouth - yum! We enjoyed soupy pork and shrimp dumplings and the pork-shrimp shiu mai. The highlight for us though was the savoury won ton mein - just like our Grandma used to make - right down to the homemade noodles which are not the chintzy thin noodles one often gets in Singapore but the lovely homemade slightly wider noodles - aaaahhhh - just like home. Soup broth was flavourful and the won tons were the best I've had in Singapore so yes, naturally, we'll be back
5
If you love dumplings you will love Din Tai Fung. The sights, sounds, and smells. You are fully immersed in your best dumpling experience. This Resturant is from Taiwain and will fulfill your appetite - too bad this location is in a mall food court but you will forget
4
We had lunch here. The lemongrass juice is scrumptious, as are the chili crab-pork buns, the pork dumplings (and I don't usually eat pork), and the spinach saut√É¬©ed with garlic. We also ate dates stuffed with glutinous rice. They were good but seemed like they could do with a light honey drizzle and be eaten as a dessert instead of an appetizer. The staff is nice but is Chinese and doesn't speak a lot of English so be prepared for that if you don't speak Chinese. You pay at the counter after your meal. That isn't explicit unless you watch what others do as no one directs you to do this, I'd go back here again.
4
Expensive but generally fair portions, you queue patiently for this place because once seated and served the soup filled made-to-order dumplings of all sorts simply make you swoon.This is a high end chain (I've enjoyed it in HK as well) which knows fresh and knows consistency. Two people can plan on dropping $70SGD so this isn't inexpensive. But it is worth the experience.Best to get there after 2pm when it is less crowded and the wait times not as long
5
We had dinner here one night our kids (4 & 13) loved it 4 you old had fried rice with prawns. You fill in an order form its collected and as each dish is presented it's crossed off. Free jasmine tea was a hit so much so that my husband who does not drink tea wants it back home. The pork chop is melt in your mouth and it's usually the last thing I would pick when eating out. Enjoy
5
this chain of restaurants is awesome.. and the one at paragon is just bustling on weekends.. but yet the staff are efficient and service meticulous
4
Best place to go if you are looking for Dim Sums. There will generally be a queue for seating. Make sure to order by filling up order form before you are seated and waiting to be seated. The food order later tend to get delayed.
5
We went here for a quick lunch and were fascinated by the cooks making the dim sum in the glass fronted kitchen. Great food and very reasonable price. We planned to revisit but ran out of time.
4
I literally only come here for two things: xiao long baos and the beef brisket noodles. The price is decent and the only thing negative are the long waiting times.
4
Go to one of their many outlers across singapore to sample their simply amazing dumplings and noodles and bean buns, very few options for vegetarians though
5
Food: A dumpling franchise that originated from Taiwan with 19 outlets in Singapore alone.Must Try: Their famous xiao long baos (steamed pork dumplings)! We tried their original and truffle version. Lovely delicate skin around the filling that is bursting with soup! The steamed bun with chilli crab and pork had intense flavours with a good bun to filling ratio and we really enjoyed their stir fry dou miao with garlic.Environment: It was a busy restaurant and a good 45 minutes wait for a table. However, the food was quick to arrive and service was very efficient. You can see the chefs at work behind the glass walls as they weigh every dumpling to ensure the high quality and consistency.Price: Not the cheapest. We spent around $80SGD for six small dishes for lunch
5
We loved the food here. It would have to be the best dim sum we have ever had. There was a long wait to get seated but they give you a menu so you can select your meals whilst you wait. We would highly recommend a visit to this restaurant. Yum!
5
Having been to Din Tai Fung many times, I can swear by their dim sums for the exquisite quality. The dim sums are always freshly made and are steaming hot. The variety of dim sums is also enjoyable (chicken, pork, crab, veg). In addition to dim sums, you can definitely give a try to their Hot as Sour chicken soup (if you like spicy), Steamed chicken soup (if you like bland), Chinese veggies like spinach, mango pudding and lemon grass drink.Be aware of the long queues outside the restaurant though.To give my verdict, I can safely say that I haven't eaten better dim sums like from Din Tai Fung anywhere else
4
The location at paragon is central as it right in the middle of orchard road.Din Tai fung at paragon at main meals period is always always full and long queues are evident.Be prepared to wait.Food is delicious if you had not had their dishes before. Worth the wait.Signature dish of cos is their xiao long pao
3
After Christmas shopping, we decided to have a high-tea at Din Tai Fong. The host is friendly, sharing with us some of the new promotion while walking us to our table. The waiting staff greeted us and explained to us how we can placed our orders. She is clear with her explanation and gave us some recommendations. Their service is really superb, maybe Chinese restaurant service has surpassed the western in Singapore. Ordered a number of basket of different dumplings. Waited around 10 - 12 minutes and our food arrived. Most of the dumplings tasted pretty normal, don't feel anything special about it. Maybe I have tasted something better. The staff did check with me about the food but I think she was too kind to be hurt.
5
We went to a couple of these in different locations. So yummy, wish we had them in Perth Australia.
Lots to choose from and everything we had was delicious.
Will definitely go again next time I am in Singas!
5
Awesome Dumplings and great value for money, fast service and friendly staff.. Certainly the best dumplings I have had hands down!
4
Lovely place for Dim Sum. Paid this place a visit a couple of times for dinner. To be perfectly honest, I much preferred all other dishes not Dim Sum related.
3
I had dumplings which were good and inexpensive, but ordering and service was slow. Not very welcoming or atmospheric and I'll go somewhere else next time.
4
Place is casual ( very nice open kitchen) and service a bit slow but dim sum are excellent and they give you free Jasmine tea. It is cheap and good, what more can you ask ?
5
By far the freshest, simplest and delicious meals I have had. Everything from the pork dumplings, egg rice, salad, pokchoy, veg rice, pork chilly.....just everything on the menu is to die for.
We ate here thrice in our 5 day stay in Singapore.
4
It is a busy place. It was a 15 minutes wait, but during that time, you can select the items from an extensive menu.Food is served as it comes off the assembly line - all freshly finished. We were extremely happy with our order: Steamed bean curd cubes in honey, Duck in crispy onion pastry, vegetable dumplings (par excellence), stir fried spinach in garlic, dried noodles in sauce. Add condiments on the side enhance the taste to your liking. The lemon grass drink was very refreshing.This is a place where you come to enjoy the food. Not for romance or a business meeting. It is quite noisy
4
I am a huge fan of Din Tai Fung. When I lived in Singapore (just moved) my family and I used to eat there very often. This is the branch we went to the most because it was close to where we lived. The food was excellent, but I found the kitchen a bit slow. The order of the meal was sometimes odd... sometimes things that should have come at the beginning of the meal came at the end. Service was slow, but they kept the tea flowing. The outside of the place is normally chaos, and the restaurant is loud, but the food is worth the visit
5
It is probably the best dim sum joint in town, if you ask me. We visit once a month, at least. my spouse who is not a big fan of local cuisine, makes an exception only for DTF. Now, we have a branch closer home, at Bedok, and hence don't visit the Paragon branch much. My only grouse with DTF is that the servers and the hostesses are not proficient in English and hence there is always a comm gap. but, not insurmountable. do try it out, if you haven't already
5
Having lived in Shanghai eating often at DTF, we simply had to go there in Singapore. And it was great! It's the Rolls Royce of dumplings, at least in shanghai. Actually a bit cheaper in Singapore which was a surprise. The pork dumplings, shrimp and pork dumplings, spicy cucumber, the tofu vegetable mix, wontons... Wow! Went back a second time to another outlet in a mall in China Town, just as good there, if not better (there is always a little taste difference between the DTF outlets). Already missing it
4
They had the best Dim Sum's, just couldn't stop eating them. Would love to visit them again. Hope they soon start a branch in Dubai!
4
Hongkong dimsum, The food is ok, but not really wow. The price is reasonable & not too expensive compare with other restaurants in this area.
4
Knowing there is usually a queue, we went for an early brunch and walked straight in without having to wait, food and service were excellent with free-flowing jasmine tea. My first visit to this restaurant chain and it won't be my last.
5
Great place with a view on the skillful artists who make the food. Excellent quality food, lots of choice. Even with a big group of people you. An have a wonderful lunch or diner here.
5
It is not an easy restaurant to find in the basement of the Paragon Shopping Centre and on the Saturday we visited in October we had a wait of half an hour .Dumplings and fried rice were best ever as they were so freshly made. Service was quick and efficient and we were impressed to see the dumplings being made in kitchen as we waited to be seated .We would certainly try again and would be delighted if they brought a branch to our home in Melbourne
2
Located in the basement of Paragon. I've been to extensive dimsum restaurants, in Indonesia, in Australia, inMalaysia, in Singapore, or elsewhere. But, I don't find Din Tai Fung deliciously satifying my crave for superb dimsums. First, the service is very slow.. My Mom complained that her food arrived after 20 minutes of waiting. First, We often have to queu to get seats. Then, order foods.. Wait for sometime. In terms of value for money, I don't recommend this resto for those on a "budget" or in a hurry.
5
Freshly made dumplings and noodles were the best we've ever had. Don't be put off by the long line at the entrance, by the time we decided what we wanted on the menu we were ushered in and the food ordered immediately. Staff were efficient though not overly-friendly, and it helps if you can speak Chinese
3
Visited with family when in Singapore - had to wait for a while before seats were available and ordered a range of dishes including different dumplings, fried rice, wanton soup, etc. There was an 'offer' whereby if a certain amount was spent we would get a sour/ spicy soup - this actually tasted disappointing and there was nothing spicy or special about it. Is that why they were flogging this average soup no one would have paid good money for??? The fried rice and prawn wantons were delicious though. The steamed dumplings were also interesting, my husband liked the crab one and I thought the xiao long bao which were the signature dumplings were really good. A little off putting was a waiter who kept trying a hard sell over some new pineapple tarts they had. He offered us a tiny free sample each then wouldn't budge till we had them and given him our opinion. Then he kept asking us whether we would like to order some which was irksome when we were trying to enjoy our meal. The food was pretty good in general, but the over zealous "marketing" efforts by said staff left alot to be desired
4
Great experience of dim sum, almost made in front of you. Be prepared to wait for a bit long if you go on peak hours (we waited 40 min at 1.40 pm on Saturday). Very efficient service and fast once you're seated. Staff corteous and competent. A famous place in Singapore. Only thing we didn't like is that the location is in the mall basement (ie no natural light)
5
No wonder why this place get great reviews and is always FULL. Its a money making machine super well run with great food and attentive service. We always go there and love it. Their dumplings are amazing and pleases always all the guests visiting town we bring there. Great value for money for some delicious food.
5
Din Tai Fung brings the best Dim Sum at affordable price.. If you are in Singapore, and want to try good Dim Sum.. This is the place..
5
I tried the Michelin-starred version of chicken rice here and boy, was I satisfied! It's much tastier and fancier of course but the basic chicken blend is there :)
5
We had two days in Singapore and ate here twice - would have been three times but the wait was an hour. Brilliant fresh tasty food, swift service and very clean throughout. A must if in Singapore you'll love it. We'll be back.
4
It is famous for its noodles and yum cha. The environment is clean and service is good. Overall the food is good at reasonable price
3
Their dimsums are great! Food was served in time. Very systematic
Service.i always bring my friends who visit singapore and it never fails to impress them. Suggestion to open up more branches to minimiE long queue or wait for customers.
4
What sharp operators these guys are. Line up and take a number, get a menu, plan your meal and place your order when your number is called. You are seated, green tea on the table before you get comfortable and next thing your meal starts to arrive.WOW, what a meal. I am still trying to work out how they get the soup inside the dumplings but they do, and they are fabulous. Everything we had was super tasty so no surprising they have a Michelin star. For good food at good value, do not miss
3
In the past this has been a top place to eat - outstanding dumplings at a reasonable price. Our latest visit was a disappointment compared with a year or so ago. Quality of food had deteriorated and I do not think we are alone in that view as there were no real queues (as there used to be) and the diners seemed not to be locals. Not a bad meal but a disappointment
5
This was our second visit (2 years between trips as we live in Dubai!) but it was worth the wait. We were warned that it may take 50 minutes for our table - but i think that they must give a pessamistic calculation as we were seated within 25. When ordering use the photo-sign board to the right side of the reception desk as the names on the tick-sheet menu give you no clue! The chicken noodles were great, as were the Dim Sum. We tried the veggie option - not great - avoid unless you are a vegetarian! Service was speedy and accurate. We avoided dessert as they werent great last time - and had a delicious ice cream from the New Zealand ice cream shop on the way out of Paragon
4
Visited last August. We stopped here for a light bite while shopping. We knew it was good as there were queues. We were seated quickly and found the choice on the menu mind boggling - it was vast. We just wanted dim sum but boy what a choice! We were given some suggestions and they were delicious - we were happy. Fed and watered we were off shopping again. I would recommend it
5
Often I see tourists puzzling over the menu. And then ordering odd stuff. Partly it may be taste which is of course non disputable. But partly they may feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of items. So this review is for you, dear tourist. First, this is a must eat place. Prices are reasonable and kids love seeing the dim sum production. Second, when ordering share everything. Third, their core product is the simple steamed dumpling - the one with the soup inside. Variants on this adds crab (mildly but delightfully spicy), truffles (unsurprisingly expensive), or bitter gourd (avoidable). The basic dumpling should be the core of your meal. Try the prawn pancake or cucumber or dumplings in chili oil as a starter. The sliced duck pastry is a nice dish for nibbling. They are also famous for their double boiled chicken soup, which is great if you have a throat niggle. I find it a bit bland and so prefer the hot and sour one. The other thing to try are their noodles. They are freshly made and the difference is noticeable. You can't go wrong with any of them. My favorites are dan dan which is in peanut sauce and the one with bean sauce. Ask the server to cut the noodles if your skills with chopsticks are not up to par. Kids like the fried rice either with prawns or pork chop. Amongst the veggies, try the Dou Miao or white cabbage with garlic. Be adventurous - even though broccoli is the only one you will recognize, try something new. Desserts are an acquired taste so tread carefully. I like the steamed sesame bun and the red bean paste bun but many of my friends find it a bit shocking to their palate. It's very far from tiramisu and cakes. Sugar is a relatively recent addition to the Chinese palate and hence their deserts are non sugar based. One warning - service is functional and sans smiles. Close with a pop quiz - how do they get the soup inside the dim sum? Tiny frozen soup balls that melt when it's steamed.
5
Tried several dumplings that were delicious. Xiaolongbao of course was a must and we were not disappointed. Many people waiting but entirely worthwhile. We went there around 6:00 PM and had to wait about 30 minutes but no disappointed a all!
5
Dumplings were exquisite. It was an amazing dinner with an amazing family and the atmosphere was great. Very authentic Chinese restaurant and loved it.
4
My wife's regular dim sum place. Many choices and good quality food. Don't forget to explore items other than the regular and you will be pleased. This restaurant can have a long line in the evening!
5
So good we went back two days later. The dim sum and buns were wonderful. Combine that with pork and rice, noodles and a carrot juice. I'm, sure others will mention this but the ordering method was new to us with the customer filling out tick boxes with the number of each item you wanted.Service was friendly and the jasmine tea flowed all eveing.Will be going back
5
I make a special effort when I visit Singapore to eat at Din Tai Fung and it is as excellent as I remember. The Paragon branch is always busy, so Wisma and Raffles City looked a little quieter if you prefer. One of my 'don't miss' experiences in this great food city.
4
Great dumplings! We do not get this type, the ones with broth and filling inside near me in Rhode Island so it was a treat. Can get quite busy but the turn over tables quite fast. Very clean, open kitchen so you will see the dumplings being made by cooks wearing white lab-type coats and face masks. The dumplings are brought to the table by similarly appareled staff.I had dinner there with a local and then went back the next day for lunch. I will make it a point to go again next time in Singapore
4
The Shao Long Bao (steamed portk dumplings) are very good, and pretty much like the original in Taipei (I have eaten at the original Din Tai Fung many times). The location at Paragon did not have my favorite, the spicy shrimp wontons. I got pork wontons in spicy broth instead, and it was good, but overall it was too salty. The hot and sour soup was excellent
5
Found by chance in the food court of Paragon Mall on Orchard Road. This restaurant has been visited by Tom Cruise and has won a number of awards. You order food before you are seated. Service is quick, efficient and friendly. Food is just amazing. So tasty and fresh. The Dim Sum is a must
5
Never ever tasted Dim Sum. But this evening was our first time. Mama San forced me to go. I let her order what ever she likes and I might eat as well. When food start to come and first bites tasted I was really surprisesed how light and tasty Dim Sun can be. This is not last time for these treats. Kitchen professionals worked like machines and they looked moro doctors than chefs. So hygienic and clean. Go and see your self. Place like this means you must wait before seating
5
Enjoyed a delicious dinner here with my wife. First off, let me say that the service was fast, efficient and friendly... we were very well taken care of from the front of the house to the service throughout our meal (My tea never went empty and it was re-filled around ten times... Great work!). It's a busy restaurant, not bad service, c'mon TA reviewers, be fair! We ordered the Chili crab dumplings, prawn dumplings, pork dumplings, the sesame bun and the prawn pancake. The dumplings were all delicious and I highly recommend them. I wish we had the room for more as we saw many other delicious looking dishes (Fried rice) coming out to other tables. I've eaten Dim Sum for years and Din Tai Fung up there with the best. You'll likely have to wait in line (We waited 30 min) but it is totally worth it and well priced ($40 for our order). Don't think twice about going here, it really is one of then best restaurants in the world
4
quality of the food= very good
waiting time for the table = terrible
classic chicken noodle is still one of the best and should try the rosella tea // lemon tea // lemon grass tea, all are refreshing
2
I tried because my friend said better than in Jakarta, because not halal. But for me is the same, not nice the taste. I will not come back again.
4
Paragon branch, Orchard Road. Well appointed and very pleasant restaurant. Very good dumplings. Great prawn pancakes. Fast, friendly service. Get there early to avoid the queues.
5
This is the place we take our local and foreign friends to - for the best dumplings in town. Several choices of dumplings, always top quality plus many additional dishes to explore new food and tastes. Service is fast, friendly. You order from the menu card but put on the order slip what you would like. Easy and fast ordering. Be there just a little before the main meal times in order not to have to wait outside the restaurant for too long. Tables are usually taken quickly. While having a good conversion with friends the food keeps on coming and between we watch how they prepare fresh the dumplings in the kitchen
5
This was the second visit to a Din Tai Fung following a visit to the Pavilion at KL‚Ä¶ food was consistently outstanding... ordered much of the same again (prawn dumplings, pork bun rolls etc.) Service was just as quick, food just as delicious, and a nice restaurant (although I personally preferred the KL a little more). We tried looking for a one off dumpling place in Singapore but were not let down by Din Tai Fung‚Ä¶ do yourself a favour and go
3
The food is just so so. Maybe because their steamer wasn't working on the day we went so we could not try their most famous Xiao Long Bao. Other than that, the restaurant looks clean. The servers were polite. We will try again the next time we go there and be sure to ask if their steamers are working first before entering the restaurant :
5
Interesting ordering concept, but made ordering multiple dishes easy. The was a bit of a wait and you aren't able to make reservations, but definitely worth it, especially if you like dim sum. The oriental salad, Truffle Xiao Long Bao (signature dumpling), and juices are great with all of the dishes freshly made in the kitchen that surrounds the restaurant. Definitely recommend for an easy meal
4
When ordering, the staff will give you a menu, pen and the order slip where you will indicate the number of orders of your preferred food. Quite easy to accomplish the order for as numbers are reflected on each food variety so you just need to reflect the number of orders based on the figures located in every picture.I enjoyed all the orders and my favorite and recommendation according to taste are as follows: Crispy duck, vegetable saut√©ed in garlic, rice, and vegetable dimsum. Affordable price for such quality food. You may have to order your dimsum in advance as it takes a while before it is served.As the restaurant is usually full, recommending that you come early to avoid the queue
4
I love Chinese/Taiwanese dumplings and this is probably the best dumpling chain ever. I came here with some local friends and I would bring some international friends back. The dumplings are made fresh, and you can even observe the chefs through the open kitchen, which in my opinion is really cool.they are priced reasonably and offer a wide selection of dumplings. I‚Äôm sure they have something for everybody. Try avoiding a Saturday as you might have to wait for over an hour. But it is worth waiting (if you have time). They have vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, however I‚Äôm not sure about vegan dishes.The only thing I disliked, was the service quality, sadly the staff is always stressed out and do not treat you in a special friendly manner
4
I have visited this chain in Shanghai and Beijing too. The food is always excellent, especially the pork dim sum. This particular branch in Singapore is a bit more canteen style but the food is excellent. I had a basket of pork dim sum, some stir fried green local vegetable with garlic and the breaded pork chop with egg fried rice. It was amazing but too much for me so the staff boxed up my left overs. The staff were not the friendliest nor the most efficient but the food more than made up for it. I would definitely return for a tasty lunch
5
A visit to this restaurant chain is a must while in Singapore. Don't expect excellent service but the dumplings are nonetheless worth it. Enjoy!
5
Best dumplings I have ever eaten and great atmosphere which I funnily dubbed the Dumpling Hospital with employees running around in walkie talkies and the cooks dressed in white working their magic.
5
This place is excellent for Chinese food specially their dimsums. The pork and crab meat and pork and prawn dimsums are to die for. The egg fried rice is supreme and add a little shrimp to it, it's even better! They serve free jasmine tea and it adds to the meal. All Din Tai Fung outlets no matter where and what time are always crowded so be prepared to wait for your table. However while you're waiting the restaurant will give you a menu print out and you can choose what you want to order so you don't waste time inside. It's almost like eating at a high end fast food joint. It's an old Taiwanese restaurant and it's one of the best in Singapore
4
Every time we come to Singapore we have lunch one at Din Tai Fung (paragon), we think it is the best one in Singapore. Even though you have to queue to get a table the wait is worth it. Make sure when you order get the set of 10 dumplings...
5
Walking through down Orchid Road after a spot of shopping and saw this restaurant which was recommended by a colleague in Singapore. Decided to go up and wait for the 15 minutes, to get a table, it was pumping. Had the Wontons in chilli sauce, Pork and Chilli Crab Buns and Prawn Dumplings. I wasnt disappointed and they would have to be the best dumplings that I have had. Worth a visit and very reasonably priced as well

We first experienced soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) in Shanghai purely by accident. We enjoyed them immensely, and since then it became a quest when travelling to try and find more. Singapore is one of those places where we found the dumplings to be excellent, and the restaurant is Din Tai Fung. While there are a number of them in Singapore (as well as other countries) we frequent the one in the Paragon shopping center on Orchard road, just east of Scotts road. It's in the first basement level on the outskirts of a large food court.We always get the soup dumplings and some other assorted dishes. The dumplings did not disappoint us and were just a delicious as usual. Care must be taken when eating the soup dumplings as the broth inside is very hot (temperature wise). I prefer to nibble the top and let the steam out (which allows me to spice them up a bit). In addition we also got the dumplings in chili sauce, which are soaking in a nice spicy sauce, which also goes well on the soup dumpling.Prices are a bit high for a large meal, especially if you try some of the more exotic versions, like truffles.The restaurant can get very crowded around meal times, and there can be a significant wait (20+ minutes) but getting there at off meal times allows you almost instant seating. While the restaurant is large and can get very crowded, the service is excellent. We have experienced some language issues (yes, I know, I'm in Asia) but they would quickly get someone who spoke English. There are some private rooms that can accommodate larger groups, and I would recommend one if you are planning on eating with a group. It provides a more quiet and comfortable experience. While waiting to get seated, it's very interesting to watch the dumplings being made. There's a large glassed in room in the center of the restaurant where you can examine their craft. I wonder what they think of us sitting out there watching them
4
The place seems to be always crowded with people waiting to get in... and by the time we had ordered a lot of dumpling options were already over, but whatever else we ordered was great, however the complimentary rice with stuffed black beans (dessert) was not worth even tasting else service was prompt and fast, but English can be an issue with a lot of staff..
5
I stopped here with my sister who lives in Singapore for lunch. We had Noodles with a spicy sauce to start with, followed by steamed chicken dumplings, steamed pork and prawn dumplings and stir fried kailan. For desert we had mango pudding. Not only is the food fantastic and reasonably priced but the ordering process is brilliant and works really well. You are given a number (a bit like waiting at the cheese counter!) and a list showing the different dishes to choose from. You tick what you want and give it back to the person at the reception. Within 5 minutes our number was called and we made our way to our table where we were served tea then our order started coming out to us. The service was great - in all a fantastic experience ;-
5
We had our first meal in singapore in this restaurant and it was the best meal of our trip (which is saying a lot given the standard of Singapore cuisine). The dumplings and wanton soup were just amazing, best ever!Be prepared to queue for a table though..
5
Had the pleasure of enjoying a Sunday breakfast here after arriving in Singapore on the endless flight from NJ. Restaurant opens at 10:00 AM on Sunday. Perfect time to visit, before the madness takes over with crowds feasting on the best dim sum in Singapore. All dumplings/soups/dim sum are perfect. Vegetables and noodle dishes as well. Attentive service; if your server is not comfortable in English, simply point at the extensive menu. Restaurant is busy from opening bell to closing. No reservations taken. Credit Cards accepted. If you must wait, enjoy watching the dumplings being made in the open kitchen by experts at their craft. Believe the Paragon location is their best in Singapore
5
Try the pork wonton dumplings in black vinegar. We ate at the Marina Bay location and the Paragon in Singapore. it is quite a show to watch the chefs making the noodles and dumplings . First class operation. There always seems to be a lineup.
5
This is a chain you will find all over Singapore, but the food is healthy and reasonably priced. They are located in the mall "hawker stalls". You will be so grateful for the cleanliness and air conditioning.The service is good but you may have to wait at peak times. Perfect place to eat when you are jet lagged and want something lighter
5
They should advertise the Din Tai Fung as a Singapore attraction, rather than as a Restraunt. Every time I am in Singapore, I head for the nearest Din Tai Fung for lunch. This time it was their restaurant on Orchard, in the Paragon mall, right across the road from Ngee Ann City.Like all Din Tai Fungs, there is always a queue, even mid week. You put down your name with the young lady at the door, and she promptly hands you a Menu to mark out while you wait. The waiting varies, and this time we waited for about 20 minutes before they rang up our number. But the waiting time does give you a chance to go through the over 100 dish Menu. We always start by ticking the Steamed Pork Dumplings, and the go into the almost unending choices.We handed over our marked menu to the young lady who seated us at our table, and then waited for a meal that is one of the star attractions in Singapore.They have a cup of hot chinese tea waiting at the table. There is a show kitchen- in fact two show kitchens- and from where we sat, we had a great view of the choreographed actions of chefs in surgical masks behind the sound proof glass, their long knives chopping and long spoons ladeling streaming strands of noodles,working amidst with steam and the bamboo dim sum baskets.We ate a plate of Green Chilies stuffed with marinated minced meat, Steamed Pork dim sums, Fried Rice with Eggs and Stir-fried Spinach with Garlic. They kept refilling the tea.The whole meal for 2 cost less than Singapore $40. And we left with a the overwhelming feeling of warm contentment
4
I visited here for lunch, & it was very busy had to wait outside for a table for around 20 minutes. I was given a menu to peruse whilst I waited. A waitress came aroubd giving out cups of tea to customers, which was a nice touch. I had a bowl of hot and sour soup to stary with, followed by a delection of dumplings which were excellent. Very good value & worth a visit if uou get chance!
4
Part of a chain the "original" of which in Taiwan is regularly voted amongst the best in the world. I certainly wouldn't say that, but for a small restaurant buried in the food court of a shopping centre, it is incredible. Pork and Crab and Pork Dumplings that are so light the dumpling seems to explode on the tongue. Inside, delicately flavoured meats. Really amazing. Other dishes - noodles, rice, vegetables - are good, but it is the dumplings that carry the day. Very reasonably priced. The only alcohol served is Tiger or Taiwanese beer. The atmosphere is a bit "canteen", but the free endless jasmine tea is a nice touch.
4
The food was tasty, I wish they have more variety, though. Especially for the dumplings. I like their shrimp fried rice, shrimp was really tasty: fresh & plump.Service can be a bit spotty during peak hours, & a lot of the wait staff don't speak English so it's difficult to communicate.Tip: avoid coming here at peak lunch/dinner hour. You'll wait for ages & you have to wait near the woman who assigns the table otherwise you'd miss your number
5
This restaurant is one where you have to wait to get in but its worth the time spent waiting in line.The Shiao long bao are best here. no one comes a close second. The steamed dumplings in XO sauce are spicy but very tasty. The joy of eating here is in the fact that everything comes straight from the steamer to the table.
4
Its the dimsum place with a lot of reviews. The dimsum is very good and the xiao lang bao is good. Its the dimsum with soup inside it. Don't forget to order the chinese noodles as they apparently make their own noodles. The price is very reasonable and you can get a good fill for a decent price.
5
As commented by other reviewers - expect to wait (but for us only 15 mins on a busy Saturday evening) but be rewarded with excellent noodles and dim sum, very fresh and hot, and good value. The nicely hot tea comes for free, and regularly. But its the bustling atmosphere, and the cooking-as-theatre apparoach that makes this a great experience. We'll be back
5
A regular favourite of mine when in Singapore. Delicious food in a very hectic environment, and great value for money. Be prepared to wait to get in, however this place is 100% worth the short while that you do have to wait. Will definitely be returning to this amazing place; a great location also right in the heart of the central Orchard Road
5
Food is excellent and very good value for money. Staff is very pleasant. Very impressive open kitchen. Very clean. A not to be missed place.
3
Me and my colleague had dinner here. The food was good not great although that might be because of my taste of Chinese food. The portions though were huge
5
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. The dumplings are subtle, taste wonderful and they also have a great variety. While you wait you can actually see how they are prepared in a clean and efficient environment. Waiters are fast and efficient. If you have to wait 30 minutes or so, prepare your order and 5 minutes after you get your table you will begin enjoying your meal.Good options for vegetarians
4
am amazing experience for dumpling lovers. the choices seemed unlimited and the food is just amazing. being such a popular restaurant there is a wait involved but it is well worth the wait. probably best if you go with someone who knows what to order as there are a lot of choices. and, wash it down with a taiwanese beer to enhance the experience
4
Everything is fun here (if you have the time) from the queuing for a table (whilst watching the dozens of chefs make the dozens of folds which go into making the dumplings) to ordering from bits of paper to actually eating the dumplings and watching your friends' eyes pop out as the tasty hot soup explodes from the dumpling. This place is cheap and cheerful with staff running you into the restaurant and than running you out in order to run the next lot in. Don't come here for a long and leisurely meal (unless outside the normal eating hours) or for gourmet dim sums but the food is unfailingly good and the different varieties of dumplings are getting as long as the queue outside
4
Visited the Paragon branch of this establishment twice recently, at 2 pm and at 4:40 pm. Both times, got a table for two right away. Previously, had tried at noon and at 6 pm, and left having seen the gigantic queue. Food is, as other have noted, very good, and service was efficient and courteous. Yes, it is a chain, but the quality is uniformly good, if you are after its type of food (you can see menus on their website)
4
We've been here about 10 times in the last 7 years and it's always been really good.Love the dumplings and the braised beef shank noodles, but everything was slightly under-seasoned this time. Our group of 10 all agreed and we've all eaten here at least 50 times collectively. The prawn fried rice was exceptionally good.It was FREEZING COLD (more than all other SG malls!) so that the waitresses brought big shawls for us to use which is really kind but a ridiculous solution to the problem! Obviously, the staff know that this is a problem so why don't they just adjust the aircon??? Also, the food gets cold really fast so it's really less enjoyable. Please, please make the temperature a comfortable one for your guests. Thanks

My wife and I went there many times after the reopening and it was amazing food, but today was very disappointed. The hot and sour soup had no taste, and it looks like they cut on the cost as they were so much tofu inside. Then we had the vermicelli salad, same, taste less, not like it use to be. Then we had the crispy prawn pancake for the first time and it was nice. But when we started the dim sum, we looked each other and say ... Did they change the chef ? The steamed pork and prawn dumpling were dry, and my favorite crab and pork dumpling where just very basic with a thick dough ... Use to be nice and thin... For the first time we did not finish them... What happen ? We don't know but one place for sure we are never disappointed regarding dumpling is the Imperial treasure congee and noodles at Ion basement 2... Too bad the quality at Din Tai Fung is not as it use to be...
5
I'm from Los Angeles, and we have 2 Din Tai Fung restaurants here. But the wait is often 45 mins. to +1 hour. I had to go all the way to Singapore to finally eat there. Well worth the wait, but next time I think I will just go to one of the restaurants in L.A. When you put your name in, they give you checklist and menu. You read through the menu and check off what you want. The wait was about 25 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. There was 5 of us and we ordered a lot! One of our friends had given us recommendations on what to order....and we ended up following up on her advice. The large windows in one of the kitchens show the staff making the various dumplings. It was great to watch.When our order came, everything was delicious! Prepared hot and savory. I am not going to wait too long to visit again (either the Singapore branch or the Los Angeles one)
5
The juicy wantons - their specialty - amazing but everything was great. We had 6 adults and 6 kids and had a great time. Got the separate room given to us and thought we ordered too much but ate it all... Will be back again and again and again hopefully..
4
I don't remember how many times we have visited there. Every time, we visited to Singapore, we went there. Food are good. Systematic . Healthy. Staffs are friendly. I like this one more than the one from Hong Kong. recommend.
5
Visited this restaurant with family as they had been many times and it did not disappoint. The food was healthy and as fresh as I've ever tasted. With plenty of options. Amazing.
4
This chain of restaurants is a must-visit if you haven't already. I make it a mission to stop by one whenever I do make a trip to Singapore.
The food is great, the service is great, the atmosphere is wonderful.
5
It's become a tradition that Din Tai Fung is the first stop with every Singapore trip for me. Delicious steamed buns and dumplings. The Dan Dan Noodles are very tasty too.
5
Not our first visit by a long shot! We are still amazed at the quality of the food and just how efficient this restaurant is.Long queues outside so be patient- our wait was 30 minutes (Sunday lunchtime) but you do score in that you have already chosen your meal before you enter the restaurant. Food arrives in less than 5 minutes and you get complimentary tea (bottomless) on sitting down.You see them making the Dim Sums through the glass walled kitchens and the taste of all the items are 'to die for'Can't wait to come back to Singapor
4
I still have to try Taipei- but this chain's wild success means that to compare properly we need to go global.Service a bit less focused than normal at DTF establishments- room for improvement.That said the quality and frehness of the food is up to the usual (and high) standards one can expect at this establishment.Would retur
5
We had the pork dumplings and they were hands-down the nicest pork dumplings I have ever eaten in my life (and I've tried quite a few). It may seem crazy with all the people lining up with numbers and menus but it's worth the wait (and much quieter once you're inside).
4
Following the maxim that everything is improved by pork, Din Tai Fung does not hesitate to add it even vegetarian and seafood dumplings. What was I to do - not eat it? So eat it I did with a dash of guilt to accompany the succulent xiaolongbao, topped with fresh shredded ginger and soy chilli sauce. It was heavenly. So was the delicious chili noodles, fried rice and chicken noodle soup. The place is scrupulously clean and amazing efficient at getting you to your dumplings fast. It's also child-friendly. They have high chairs and special dining sets (available for SGD15 at checkout!). They also have small white cribs for your bags to keep them off the floor, which is then covered with crisp white napkins. I don't know about the bags, but I needed a nap after lunch here
5
Having visited several branches of Din Tai Fung in Singapore I can testify that the Paragon Shopping Centre branch takes the cake! There was a long queue which was being deftly handled by the person at the reception with the help of an excellent communication system. We were six in our group and it took a little while for them to find us seats. But once seated, the ordering and serving worked with clockwork precision.The dumplings (chicken, prawn, crab and prok) were heavenly and the xiao long bao was out of the world. Lemon grass juice helped us wash down the delicate dumplings. The fried rice with shrimps and eggs tasted great. On the whole, an evening well-spent celebrating good food
4
looking for somewhere to help deal with jet-lag, we stumbled upon the Din Tai Fung chain. What a find! No-nonsense service and delicious food at a great price. While having the food delivered by white clad staff with face masks looking a little like extras from an episode of a hospital drama seems a tad weird, the smiling eyes behind the masks makes it still seem welcoming. It helps to "know the trick" when ordering√¢‚Ç¨‚Äùthe order form/menu is put on the table when you are seated and it is your job to make the selections you want and mark them on the form. (But, the staff are flexible and you can add easily add more options if you still feel hungry.)The tables tops can suddenly seem a bit small when the baskets of dumplings and buns and the plates of rice begin to arrive. But some good humoured rearrangement of beer bottles, plates and chopsticks makes everything possible.In two recent visits to Singapore, we ate at one of the Din Tai Fung outlets each time. Both outlets had the same slick service and good value meals, but the Paragon outlet, being in the lower levels of a shopping mall lacks the added ambience a view can provide. But, it is conveniently close to hotels in Orchard Road
5
The dumplings at this place are something to behold. The precision and efficiency of the kitchen is incredible and best of all they taste amazing. To top it off the food is so affordable.
5
Had excellent xiao long bao dim sum. Best we had. Also had the fried rice and green vegetables. Highly recommend both also. Diners around us were sharing a lot of different dishes. Go with a group if you can so you can share.
4
This place is amazing. Although our dim sum at home (KL) is normally at a modest plastic chair type restaurant and is much cheaper Din Tai Fung is a treat when in Singapore. The seating and ordering runs like clockwork and it really is theatre seeing the chefs in action. We sat around for a while chatting after our meal and appreciated not being shuffled out despite the place being so busy all the time
4
Fresh tasty dumplings you can see being made and cooked. Speedy service, never half finished the tea before it was refilled. Sterile basement location and functional operation prevents good food at great value becoming a notable dining experience.However being two thirds full compared to near empty for the other restaurants in that basement vicinity is testament to the quality of the food
4
Our first meal in Singapore was in Din Tai Fung at Paragon along Orchard Rd. At first my hubby and I didn't know what to choose from a wide variety of dumplings. One can have a decent meal at Sgd10 to Sgd20 and still can spend as much as you want to indulge with all the dumplings in the menu. But Xiao long bao is a must try..a pork dumpling that would burst in your mouth with a saucy surprise. We also had fried rice with prawn toppings, braised beef, steamed chicken soup, soda and jasmine tea...and we were very full. The ambiance looks expensive and very clean. The dining area is surrounded by glass partitions where noodles, dumplings and food was being prepared. Oh yes, be ready for long lines but service was systematic and organized making it relatively fast enough
5
I stumbled across Din Tai Fung in the Paragon one afternoon as I was looking for somewhere to go to dinner later on that night. Headed back with my wife later on and was seated promptly. The array of dumplings on the menu is quite extraordinary. So much choice. Once we figured out what to do and how to order, we just sat back watching all the flurry of activity behind the glass windows.It really is like watching a science class. Everything appears spotless with the staff dressed in their white suits and masks. Every person has their own task and it all appeared to run like clockwork.The prawn & pork dumplings were excellent. Certainly up there with the best dumplings I've ever eaten. Unfortunately our fried rice arrived well after we'd eaten everything else, so something went stray with their production line.We did enjoy the experience and visited the 313@Somerset store for a huge family feast a few nights later.A must do whilst you're in Asia
4
A friend from Sydney had recommended that we go to Din Tai Fung at the Paragon. After hours and hours of exploring Singapore on foot we decided to have a late lunch at Din Tai Fung. It is remarkable to watch the chefs as they prepare the dumplings under strict hygienic conditions. We ordered a oriental salad and then dumplings and we had the a special of pork dumplings with a spicy sauce. The food was superb! Really tasty and well priced. I would definitely recommend a visit to Din Tai Fun
4
I went to din tai fung because its popular of its dumplings. I ordered and tried it. It was really good! I ordered the one that has 10 dumplings in a portion.I also ordered noodle with spicy sauce. Its okay but not really delicious. I also ordered prawn fried pankcakes i think(?) i forgot the name but it was also really yummy!! And the mango pudding is to die for! The service was okay..Overall, this restaurant is awesome!
4
My cousin took me here, she said this place was always busy but its a must try while you're in Asia. I believe they also have Din Tai Fung in Hong Kong and Taipei. Its one of those popular places but trust me, its not overrated. Damn so much dumpling choices in their menu, even their fried rice with fried pork chops is really good. As for the price its not cheap but not too expensive either. I cant remember exactly how much it was because this was a treat from my cousins. I highly recommend their pork dumplings with soup inside (Xiao Long Bao). Make sure you dont just poke this one with chopsticks, eating it with the soup inside is the best part! Happy eating
5
The key word for this dinner trip is certainly: DUMPLINGS. They definitely look simple, but don't let the visuals fool you as the inside is soft tender meat and tasty soup and all these come under one name, the Xiao Long Bao. There were other types of dumplings available as well such as the vegetarian dumpling. Will return for more in the future
3
Better than the one at Marina Bay Sands. Higher quality of food. Seems like there is an inconsistent culinary preparation at Din Tai Fung. All outlets should have the same standards.
4
The queue may be long but the wait will be rewarded with the best dumplings in Singapore. You can't miss the truffle dumpling! They service could be warmer but the food compensates everything...
4
We were staying at Marina Bay Sands and did not even know that there was a branch. I looked for best Chinese restaurant in Singapore at Worldtop7 where I book our hotels and look for bars/restaurants to visit while traveling and read the review here http://bit.ly/14RLdNC so we made it a point to taste their dim sum while in the country. Service was average-good and the prices are even better. The food was quite tasty, especially the ruffled dim sum! The specialty xiao long bao is a must try. You might want to visit during off peak hours so as not to wait long for a table
5
I had read great reviews on Din Tai Fung and happened so on the last day of our trip me and my partner happened to walk into their Paragon Branch, not exactly a great dining ambiance for our last meal together before we flew back to our respective countries (since we have an long distance relationship) the restaurant had a food court like touch to it, overcrowded with children and families which is expectant of it being located in a mall... It took us a few minutes before we got seated , definitely a very popular place to eat given the crowded chaos...the service was quicker than i expected given how packed it was... we ordered very many varieties of vegetarian dumplings an assorted mix of asparagus, shitake mushroom, spinach and other vegetables for stuffing...the presentation was simple but it tasted extremely extraordinary.. we are both non vegetarians and would have loved to try other crab and seafood variety of dumplings after being impressed with the veg variety.. yet we rounded up having a gastronomically great meal to round up our trip..its on my list to go back whenever I visit singapore again..some different options and different location this time however
5
This is one of my favourite resturants in Singapore. I LOVE the dumplings here. They are simple but tasty. At the moment they have a special dumpling, the chili crab, it is amazing!!! I highly recommend it. It is the prefect blend of sweet crab and chilli (but not too spicy) Yum!! The service is not always friendly, but the staff are very efficient and at the paragon branch you get as much jasmine tea as you can drink for free. Don't let the long lines put you off, they give you your order form so you can make your choices while you wait. It is not too expensive, our bill (for 2 adults and 2 kids) came to $60.00 and we were VERY full.
5
I have tried many Ding Tai Fung branches in Singapore and I am of the opinion that this one at Paragon is the best. If I am not wrong, this is the first Ding Tai Fund in Singapore. The soup base of their beef noodle is dark and tasty. The beef is soft and well marinated. Xiao Long Bao dumpling is another item not to be missed. At times they do have special promotion with a bank. That makes it even worthy of trying. Good restaurant: central location, good ambience, nice staff, food are reasonably priced
5
Din tai fung never failed me...as soon as I arrived in singapore this is the first place I go... its shao long bao and many others. .. the staffs were ok and the ambience is nice and clean... this place is just near to our hotel
4
During the four days we were in Singapore, we ended up eating at Din Tai Fung three times! Different branches in different places but three times nonetheless.The steamed pork dumplings are simply delicious, some of the best I've ever had (especially when dipped in the vinegar sauce). Also delicious are the dry noodles in special sauce, the chili/vinegar dumpling, and the truffle dumpling. However, the buns are terrible - the fillings are fine but the bun itself is hard and doughy instead of soft as a pork bun should be.Steer clear of that side of the menu, and you'll be in for a great meal
1
After waiting over half an hour for a table, we were seated and promptly placed our order. After another 15 or so minutes with no food or drink arriving the waitress approached us and told us there would be no more dumplings or noodles as there were not enough people in the restaurant to justify them making any more! Why didn't they tell us this before we were seated ?? We walked out and I will ever eat there again
4
The constant crowd is a testimony to the buzz & customer contentment at every Din Tai Fung branch.. We used to frequent 313 Somerset outlet, but now a days vegetarian is not available most of the times & so we tried out Paragon mall outlet. Love the spicy chilly oil with soya sauce, really brings life to the spinach & mushroom filling of the vegetarian dumplings
4
The restaurant gives the same din tai fung quality... however, I felt claustrophobic in the sterile basement location.
5
I went to Din Tai Fung on a recommendation on Tripadvisor, and I was not disappointed! The service was fast ( no queus on my visit ), the dumplings were scrumptious and the price very reasonable. I almost went back again for dinner...
3
No bad, but not fantastic... the dumpling are the same taste they're so many different better place in singapore to eat dumpling...
5
A great chain in Singapore offering a decent selection of dim sum, rice and noodle dishes. It is very popular in the evenings and you might have to wait for a table but it really is worth the wait.
5
Amazing dim sum , noodles and vegetable dishes. Best I have had. As good or better than Chinatown in New York City. Very nice people and attentive service
5
Yummy food, good atmosphere, attentive staff and oh did I mention about the yummy food? The dumplings are fabulous. Worth a visit if you want something tasty and freshly made.
5
Getting a table often requires waiting outside with a number in hand.
You dill in your order on the paper form provided while you wait. Service, once seated, is prompt and courteaous and food worth waiting for.
5
After being disappointed with Dim Sum, a local encouraged us to try Taiwanese style dumplings, and pushed this place as the absolute best to try them. Although perhaps mislead, he told us to go to the paragon branch, which supposedly was the only one in singapore that sold the truffle dumplings. Although trying almost all their other dumplings and finding them superb, particularly the dough, the truffle dumplings are really one of a kind, and worth going for all on their own (I swung by on another day, just to take another one of these to go). Again, the location could be better, but in the end, if you are in singapore, it seems like the top restaurants are either in hotels or malls, so no use complaining. A slight disappointment was that I tried to bring a bottle of champagne, as we were celebrating my girlfriend's birthday in a group, and while initially told it was ok (as seems to be standard throughout Singapore), we were then not permitted to open it once seated and having ordered
5
The crowds from 11am on wards on a Sunday are testament to the continuing popularity of this dumpling house of magic. Not much to eat if you are a vegetarian though as most things have pork. The pickles and fried rice with the tea line the stomach well after a night of excess
5
We went to this place with a colleague who already visited this restaurant. When we walked to the restaurant in the mall, we noticed that all other places were quite empty, but Din Tai Fung was completely packed. We had to wait a couple of minutes before we were seated, so perfectly ok. Then the difficult part...what to order? As we were not early, some of the dim sum were no longer available. We ordered several types of dim sum, soup and some other dishes as we wanted to try them all (or were just not able to choose). The dim sum that stood out, was the one with black truffles. Really outstandig and extraordinary!! Our jasmin teas were refilled without noticing. The staff is very friendly and attentive. After we paid at the cashier, we watched the kitchen team preparing the food in the open kitchen. I can highly recommend this place
5
You have got to try the dumplings, they are delectable. You can view the making of the delicacies while you wait, and depending on your party numbers it could be a while, so put your name down and walk around the Paragon complex.
4
I have been twice in the last two weeks to Din Tai Fung at Paragon. Staff is friendly but could be more attentive. Queuing system feels like I am in a takeaway. The food is good and not too oily. Would go again!
3
1)Menus remain same over the years
2)Food quality acceptable
3)Services acceptable
4)Different branches seems to have their own standard on food quality
4
Considering that you get to see the 'assembly plant', yet it is very appetizing, and delicious, the process must have been perfected for such a diverse set of people to flock in the malls and at peak times wait patiently for a table.We even did take away once which held very well as we lived close by so it stayed freshly cooked and served warm.Worth it

This has been my 5th time to eat in this place and was highly recommending this place to first timers . After waiting in line for 30 mins. I ordered their specialty Xiao long pao with truffles (another 20 mins wait) and was so disappointed that it was so chewy and dry! Service was so bad but if the food was good then I will be more understanding! If this chain cannot handle the hordes of people coming in and their food quality deteriorates then management has to look into this!!!!

The staff employed are from China, no offence to them but PLEASE send me an English speaking one when I tell them I cannot speak English... they chose NOT to send anyone else over and said they could understand when they clearly cannot. I had to get a stranger to help me translate to them.They also have this RIGID policy that they will not allow anyone to be seated until all the parties are in front of them. I was with 2 very hungry kids and my husband was parking the car downstairs. I told them I was ready to order and eat and all my hubby needed was that 5 mins to come up to eat... but NO!!! They couldn't even accomodate us as policy is policy.I have written to their customer feedback and what is new?? They NEVER have the decency to respond to me and yet still could send me an email to vote them the best restaurant (!?!?!?) I bet they are still trying to find some one to translate my letter after all these years..

We found this restaurant in the basement of Paragon. There was a bit of a line at the front door however it moved quite quickly and we were seated in 5 minutes. While waiting outside we were given a menu so we could place our order and were served within 5 minutes of sitting down. The Dim Sums were very good and a great way to end our trip in Singapore, if you go try the lemongrass drink - very refreshin

We just can't get enough of their Xiao-Lung-Pao, Oriental Wontons with Black Vinegar & Chilli Oil, & the Double-Boiled Papaya & Snow Fungus with Rock Sugar ! Although the queue was long, we waited for like 45mins, the delicious food makes it up for the long wait 
5
My family of 5 just simply can not get enough of din tai fungs pork soup dumplings - they are divine! We also highly rate the fried rice. We have to fight the urge to eat there every week so we can discover other foody delights of singapore
5
If your prepared to queue (there is a number system) which you will have to do at peak times (20 mins) it is well worth the time, and while you are waiting you can watch with fascination the kitchen staff intricately preparing Dim Sum at speed it is really amazing. The food is absolutely fantastic and I think that the amount of local families that you see feasting here speaks testament for the quality and authenticity. I recommend all my friends and colleagues to go to this restaurant when they visit Singapore it is on my "must" do list. To cap it off it is vey reasonable lunch for two of us Sing $ 28
4
the best dim sums i have ever eaten, the best part of the meal is that u can see them making dim sums and they are measuring each and every gm of stuffing and aslo the dough used.. wow... like machine.
5
The service is great, food is superb, only if I have the money, I will open one myself!!! We have tried the fancy ones in ION, but honestly, this is still better!
4
Xiao long bao soup dumplings even better than Joe's Shanghai in NYC Chinatown, which has been my gold standard, and a holiday special black truffle-infused chicken soup whose broth helped me attain enlightenment. Hidden away in a mall, but worth the hunt.
5
this is a michelin awardee so what should we expect from them? of course just the best meals ryt?! their pork+prawn combo steamed dim sum is a must try, it's heavenly delicious,, no joke
1
We had lunch at Ding Tai Fung, Paragon Shopping Centre, during our short holiday in Singapore. This was our third visit. The food had always been delicious. However, we noticed that the serving portions were smaller and there were price increased this time round. Considering the relatively high living standard in Singapore among the South East Asian countries, it was still value for money. Although the queue was long, we only had to wait for about 15 minutes for our table. Food was served within 5 to 10 minutes after we made the order. As always, the Xiao Long Pao was delicious
5
In short: precision in size, style and in shape, delicate, mouth-watering. Everything you want from a dim sum. Just perfect.I can't wait to come back again, and again and again. Also great to watch how they prepare it beyond the glass windows - like surgeons operating on a patient. Just great
1
Despite an impressive looking show kitchen, where you see numerous chefs making assorted dumplings (is it right to make them stand for so long?), the food is rubbish. Dumpling skins are rubbery, fried rice was oily and tasteless (yes, there's a big pot of chilli sauce you can drown the rice with to make things better). What a pity, because the original eatery in Taiwan is so different from what I ate here
3
Usually a queue. You are given a menu while you wait and a number. You tick off your choices so by the time you are seated, your order is confirmed and the dishes come pretty fast. Good dimsum but . . . . have had better. It is interesting to watch the pastry cooks preparing all the dough for the dumplings. Would go again as it is good enough.
4
We went here for dinner one night and it was packed. We ordered our meals while we waited which was really nice. Once we turned in our order and waited to be sat we watched as the cooks made our fresh dim sum through a very large window. We had a variety of dim sum, rice, and vegetables, all of it was wonderful. The service was great, they got us in pretty fast and the food arrived promptly.
5
Really loved the food here. From the prawn pancake starter to the wontons in spicy sauce this was a meal that really hit the spot. Excellent service and the place is so authentic in every way.Taiwanese food really nurtures the tastebuds of every food lover and Din Tai Fung is the best passage for that experience. Couldnt find the Somerset branch listed on Tripadvisor and that was the one I visited. Cant wait to go back
4
This is a great place to get your fill of chinese food that is very much within anyones budget. The food overall tastes good. The ambience is typical office like singapore/
2
Went twice for dinner, both occasion fried rice was not warm and it was a bit clunky. The Xiao Long Bao was a disappointment, the taste was rather bland and the skin was already torn when served - drained of soup.
3
Attended a friend's ROM celebration
Food was ok but long wait for food to be served
Service slow and noisy with customers talking loudly
4
Ever since twas a regular sunday meal in Shanghai...always enoyed this place. Fantastic to sate onself on those alone
3
I and my husband decided to have lunch at the restaurant after having lunch previous day at Crystal Jade in the same building. During lunch hour the restaurant was packed and we had to Q.The waitress are fast and efficient. The environment is nice and clean. We ordered seafood fried rice, beef noodle, vegetable dim sum and garlic broccoli. The fried rice was too oily and tasteless, the noodle and dim sum were ok. Garlic broccoli was good. I was a bit disappointed with the taste but not complaint knowing the price is reasonable

Ding Tai Fung- Paragon Shopping Centre THE PLACE for the scrumptious, thin-skinned Xiao Long Bao, among other delicious goodies! This original locale is spacious and comfortably appointed. It has 2 show-kitchens; EXCELLENT service.- Yes, as always, there is a line, but well worth the wait! OUR EXPERIENCE:- Our 2 local friends treated my wife and me to a very nice Xiao Long Bao feast here on a Wed afternoon! As expected, there was a long waiting line. But, the restaurant managed the line nicely and orderly. The area outside of the restaurant was quite pleasant and it was nice to see the kitchen staff in action through the large glass windows, while waiting anyway. It took us less than 20min wait to get our table. The dining area is more spacious than I thought, with a neat and comfortable setting. We had 5 orders of Xiao Long Baos (- 3 with pork/truffle filling; 1 with Crabmeat; 1 with Vegie filling); plus 2 side fishes. Total ~S$80; all scrumptious! The service was excellent: - Our orders were brought out piping hot; tea cups and water glasses kept full throughout; empty dishes promptly cleared away; wait staff pleasant and helpful.My wife and I like the setting and service in this branch better than those in Taipei and Los Angeles. The quality and variety of dishes are typical of Din Tai Fong fame! After such a fabulous experience, our friends then told us that there were 7+ DTF branches in Singapore! Oh boy, I envy those LUCKY Singapore people! Peterskis3, Jan 201
5
Both the food and service are excellent!! The noodles or fried rice with the little xiao long baos makes a wonderful meal. There is a little tasty soup in each of the little dumplings so be sure not to burst it before it reaches your mouth!
5
will go back just for their egg fried rice and dumpling, together with a glass lemongrass juice. The fried rice is simply the best i ever tried, not oily yet it taste terribly well. The lemongrass juice is very refreshing. although it is quite costly for a drink.
4
the issue with this place is that it is sooo popular!! Impossible to get a table without waiting long time (crazy on the weekends) and they take no reservations). If they keep the quality the same, then they should open many more branches, the demand is clearly there
4
My sister recommended their fried rice. Yes, a must try. Also tried the noodle which is great too. Please do note that it does get very crowded during lunch/dinner hour at this location. We came around 11:30am and by 12:30pm, there was a long line waiting outside the restaurant.Service is great over there too. They brought a baby chair with big bit to cover my baby cloth. Then, plastic plates, forks, spoons as well as cups for the kids without asking.
4
great quality of food, good taste. i like the din tai fung at the tampines mall best. but then all their restaurants are almost the same throughout the island
4
Din Tai Fung's truffle xiao long bao is the best dimsum I've ever tasted. Note that they didn't just use truffle oil or flavoring. There are actual truffle bits inside.
5
Din Tai Fung is a chain with amazing Dim Sum. You can't go wrong at any of their locations. Their pork dumplings are outstanding.
3
Just another of the numerous eating places in the city. There are far better restaurants. It is a If you are around and need to eat place.
5
Quick, attentive, service at this Taiwanese style dim sum restaurant in Orchard Road, and elsewhere in Singapore by all accounts.
Delicious fresh dim sum and other delicacies.
5
Extensive menu, great dumplings, friendly staff, clean and efficient - we really enjoyed our lunch here. Service was quick and food fresh and tasty. Loved the vegetarian dumplings - crispy and fresh. We were lucky enough to get a table immediately for a late lunch.
3
Din Tai Fung is always referred to as the best dumpling place around, but not so. Dumplings are good everywhere. Food at DTF is good yes, but nothing above average. Dumplings for white people. Explore anywhere else in Singapore, and the dumplings taste the same. Hell, you could go to the supermarket, buy frozen dumplings, steam them at home and they will taste the same. So go to Din Tai Fung if you like average dumplings and being ripped off
5
Always full and you may have to wait 10mins or so to be seated, during that time are given a menu to select your meal, this is a text box affair. When you are called to you table you a served promptly and as the kitchen has glass windows you can see the chefs at work. Ubber hygienic with chef staff in all in one disposable clothing and waiters/waitress serves your meal wearing a hygiene mask -over kill some might say - but sure beats a snivelling coughing unkemp waiters.I had cucumber in a hot sesamee sauce as a starter then went on to my dim sum....they are world famous for a reason - delicious! If you ever get the chance GO! Do take a cardi or jumper in as air con is quite coo
4
Everytime we visit Singapore and shop at Orchard Road, we drop into the Din Tai Fung in the food hall area of the Paragon to have some dumplings, rice and a cool beer. It is best to go outside of the really busy time slots at dinner and lunch as you will probably have to line up because you can't make a reservation and this place is very, very popular. The service is very efficient, you choose your meals from a menu, tick off your choices and your food will be delivered in a timely manner. You can see inside the kitchen which looks immaculate with the staff dressed in stark white uniforms, hair nets, hats and face masks ( all very hygenic)
4
I was very impressed with the organization of the restaurant. All the receptionists looked good, neat and extremely professional with headphones and wiki talkie. Also you can have a stool to keep your bag and they have a piece of cloth to cover on top for discretion. Never saw that before in my life so I was intrigued. Then we ordered by ticking on a list which is a bit disappointing cos' we thought we would get a more personal service with recommendation and such. Well, but this restaurant is in a mall, so it was not a reasonable expectation. The food was brought out by the cooks themselves wearing white coat, white hat and white mask but no gloves. The food in my opinion is ok, not exceptional. I have had better Chinese food elsewhere. Maybe because I am not Chinese and not local, so I can't tell how great they are because the queue to this restaurant is always very long regardless of the day of the week
4
One's singapore trip will not be complete without trying Din Tai Fung's xiao long bao. definitely the best i've tried.
5
Din Tai Fung in Singapore is almost as good as the ones in Taiwan.
Just some ingredients are different, and the staffs are less enthusiastic.
It's always a long line waiting, so I'm glad there are also Din Tai Fungs nearby(Wisma Atria and 313 Somerset).
4
Simply the best! Great food, quick service, ideal with kids. Don't go to Singapore (or any place where there is a branch) without tasting there dim sums!
4
Famous for its dumplings and rightly so, they are delicious but some of the other menu items are worthy of note. The prawn pancake is really good for example. The service is ok if a little rigid. I'll certainly be back for more.
4
I always like to order the steam xiao Long Bao and also seafood egg fried rice. As for the price, it is more expensive then other restaurant :p
1
One of the more disappointing Chinese restaurants in Singapore. Though there are chains and chains of Din Tai Fung, but they relatively serve almost the same stuff. The menu is lacking a lot in variety. However if one only wishes to consume chinese dumplings, they can head down to this restaurant. But there are many other restaurants like "crystal jade XLB" that serves good chinese dumplings with lots of variety of chinese delicacies on the menu
4
Din Tai Fung is fast becoming one of the reliable Chinese restaurant chain delivering consistent quality food across all outlets. The one in Paragon has larger dining hall which means less waiting time.Try their xiao long bao (mini steam pork bun with broth in it). Smooth texture and freshly made assures the best taste. The pork chop is a all time favorite, thin slice pork loin marinated with salt and hint of chinese spices perfectly fried.Dinner is served.Enjoy!
3
The food is great, the service is poor! This place is so popular you will envitable line up and wait at least 20 mins for a table.Make sure you order the soup dumplings... the best outside of Hong Kong.Get there before 1130am if you want a quick meal
5
This is one of my all time favorite restaurants when it comes to having steamed buns and pork dumplings... Their Food is excellent and consistent.. They have very efficient service... Expect to wait in line as they are normally very busy during peak Lunch & Dinner time.. However they have a very very efficient queuing system and can tell you exactly how long the wait is going to be.. They are also very efficient in turning tables around and time taken to deliver the food is also extremely quick so the wait time is not that bad...If you are here do not miss trying the minced pork dumpling (Xiao Long Bao)... Its my personal favorit
4
In the Paragon mall in Orchard street, we needed to look a bit where to find Din Tai Fung but the queue outside was a good indication. Labelled as a favorite in many guides, we had to stick around, wait and try it.First up, you need to go here for sheer entertainment value. How they keep things organised, the numbering system, the display of cooks wearing surgery masks prepping the dim sum, the way the waiter deliver the towering stack of bamboo steamers to the tables ... a joy to see.I can't go through the list of dim sums we had but they are all delicious, especially the way the juice oozes out of the dough packages is a taste bud delight.Try the crispy cucumber and the drunken chicken as appetizers by all means ... you won't be disappointed.Count for +- 60 to 80 S$ for 2 people having a wonderful experience.Excellent is a given here. Taste, execution, drama, ... all there
5
My family and I love this place for a quick Chinese food fix. Fast, fresh and excellent Xiao long bao, la mien, etc
5
Extensive wide range of menu, new selections of noodles BUT strangely food quality differs in the branches due to cookng style of chefs especially the noodles and the small dragon paus (steamed buns)
5
The foods there are excellent with chef, cooking the good and popular foods. Mant peoples go there to have lunch or dinner
4
Still the place for the best xiao long bao! Service is efficient and food quality is high. Only problem is waiting time on weekends which can be quite a put off.
5
They have the best Xiao Long Bao. Despite the long queue, they have a very efficient system in place to manage the queue so the wait is bearable. Food is good, service efficient and price resonable.
4
Though crowded, the waitresses always try their best to get seats for customer. Food is always same quality. Good food.
5
If you have not been too Taiwan and want to try xiao long bao, a small dumpling filled with minced pork, this is definitely the place to try. There is a method of eating it as this dumpling has a small amount of tasty soup contained within it. So do take extra care by:a. biting off the tip of the dumpling; b. suck and drink up the soup (ah, I really enjoy the taste of this); c. take some ginger provided (ensure it is covered with black vinegar first) and place it on the dumpling, and enjoy!Of course, the restaurant serves many other good dishes e.g. prawn pancakes (you can only find it here); fried rice with pork cutlet, and many other varieties of dumplings and buns.Take a number and be prepared to queue
5
Went for an evening dim sum. Three words: truffle soupy dumplings.They are worth every penny. Only 5 dumplings in a portion, but they are so rich that two dumplings is probably a wise portion per person. Many other great dim sum had also, but red bean dumplings for dessert also a standout.Hibiscus drink also noteworthy for spherical ice cube of concentrate to keep it cold, but not watery!!Take the time to peer into the kitchen, and be amazed at the artistry
3
You can see the queue from a mile away, there's just so many people and the restaurant is always so packed. You have to wait forever to get a table and I usually prefer a little more privacy when dining therefore I don't like it when they squeeze the tables so near each other and everyone can hear your conversation and vice versa. The food is good, the noodles are yummy although I prefer Crystal Jade's pork dumplings. Will go back if I don't have to wait like 1-2 hours for a table. Can be rather pricey. It would be great if the staff there can speak english as well (and not just chinese) so that ordering will be easier
5
This restaurant was my favourite of all the dim sum place i ever taste, the dim sum over there was created by pro chef, hygiene, and of course TASTY! nom! . My favourite was the Xiao Long Bao which better than any dim sum restaurant in Singapore, the skin was soft, the soup inside of the Xiao Long Bao was amazing, and the meat was well cooked and makes my stomach growl when i think about it everytime!Final Word : one of the best Dim Sum restaurant i ever visit! worthy ! :
5
I've gone a few times and it's always good. Dumplings with crab are the best. Also wantons and rice with egg are enjoyable.
5
Good service, good food and quick turnaround. We visit fairly often as the whole family enjoys the food.
4
Other than the waiting time, the food is good but the service standard is just average. No ice water served and maybe it was overcrowded
4
food is nice over here and the waitress is very friendly too,only the price is abit too high for normal people to dine there,of course it would be ok if the food is really nice.
4
The fried rice is really good and so are the dumplings. Don't miss trying the soups as well. The vegetable dishes are not outstanding but pretty much above average.
5
I come to this restaurant whenever I come to Singapore. It's great. Generally, I take the Pork Xiao Long Bao and the Chicken Xiao Long Bao. Also try the Dun Dun Mian!
Service is fast, and quality is always good.
4
Dim sum is always a winner but this has a nice atmosphere, a good range and wonderfully cooked. The only problem is some of the dishes come in large numbers so you'll need to bring several hungry friends!
5
if you dine at this restaurant you will understand why the average waiting time for a table is 30 minutes on public holidays and a little shorter during week days. It is fabulous.Recent introduction of vegetarian dumplings meant that I could take my wife and kids along as well (they are vege) and all of us had a fantastic time relishing the food. The fish & chicken dumplings are both great . The crab and pork dumplings are phenomenal In fact could not fault the food at all.Add to the fact that the food is not way overpriced (compared to quality) makes this a very popular destination indeed for eating out as a family.I would recommend it highly
5
We went to Raffles City, having been told about this place from friends, surprised at the queue, but thought the 25 min wait was acceptable. 25 minutes was spot on and having had the chance to study the menu, it was quickly filled out as we took our table. Complimentary jasmine tea was delicious and a very short wait for the best dumplings we've ever had, especially the chilli crab, and then the crab and pork dumplings, and the chicken dumplings were far from boring. A quick turnover meant it wasn't a late night. The ice-cream on the way home from the Raffles Creamery just topped off a perfect night!!
2
It was dinner time and peak period. We had a group of 10 people and were offered a Q number. We understand that the Q number will not be in running sequence because we have a huge group. After waiting for more than an hour, we realized that they prefer to offer to smaller groups of guests than to offer to a bigger group like us even if they have many smaller tables that can make up a big table.
2
Nothing impressive, went there once during Chinese New Yr with customer, He love it, but I felt alittle cramp in space, maybe service can overcome the cramp,
5
It is a very good meeting point with friends and family, I used to had lunch or dinner in Din Tai Fung. Their food quality is very consistence and I just loving it!!
3
DTF is famous for their juicy dumplings best eaten piping hot. Other dishes are ok.
5
This place is awesome. Get the xiao long bao. Don't worry if you have never had these little dumplings - they give you menus explaining how to eat them.
Also had an assortment of steamed dumplings. They were wonderful!
5
The dumplings where really good ecspecially the ones with soup!
4
The ambience makes you comfortable and feels you are in for a treat. The staff were friendly and the place was well kept. Price of the food was a little stiff but is worth it. Enjoyed a good dinner with my family.
4
I understand this chain came from Taiwan, and if so, thank you so much. I love the food and the speed which you are in and out. They will take your order while you are waiting for a table.the noodles are made in the restaurant and kids love to see this.MUST DO THIS>>>>
4
Ive been to Din Tai Fung twice now, both times when transitting through Singapore, and both times have being wonderful! The highlight of the restaurant is obviously their dim sums....But, its worth a shot at their noodles. I had their noodles with wantons...delicious! The only downside, and its rather small, is I would prefer from the dim sums to arrive before the noodles! I get to full on noodles and then cant enjoy the delicious dim sums! If your in Singapore, this is a must
5
Lunch time, reckon with a 15 to 20 minutes wait if you are more than 2 persons, but that helps you study the menu, select your dishes and gives you good time to build up an appetite as your # gets called.It is Chinese food prepared in a visible kitchen by many factory chefs, hygienically and you are served as your dishes get ready they keep bringing them.The chilly crab dumplings were great. Everything that we ordered disappeared quickly and was delicious - noodles, duck, steamed vegetables, prawn, you name it, they have it - wholesome, fresh and you can spice it or not to your taste.Service is robotic, the staff focus on quick turnaround as it is a busy place. Value for money very good
5
This is a slick operation, you advise your number of diners to the desk and you are handed a tick a box form to pre select your dumplings etc. it is so well mangaged wait times are short.The dumplings are Devine, freshly made with savory centers filled with pork, crab prawn etc.It is very popular with the locals ( always a good sign) we were addicted after our first lunch and also visited the restaurant on sentosa and at the marina bay sands
5
There really isnt much to say about Din Tai Fung except just go there. The paragon branch is great - not as crowded, depending on the time of day especially.
Dumplings aside, the noodles are also superb.
Just go there, NOW!
5
My absolute favourite were the chilli crab and pork steamed buns, but the pork dumplings were a close second. Next time I get the opportunity, I'll be back!
5
THE FOOD IS DEVINE I LOVED IT!
but they charge for the tea they bring with out you asking for in :(
4
Delicious, but be prepared to wait in queue. There are many varieties of dumplings, and noodles are yummy too.
4
Dumplings are great, but try the Dan Dan Mein. The Shanhainese version of this dish is delicious. Of course, we're all here for the dumplings. If I could, I'd try the all. I'm working my way through the list. 2 more visits should suffice.
5
I don't eat pork and am THRILLED that DTF has introduced chicken dumplings. Heavenly!
4
I've dined at several Din Tai Fung branches. This one appears to be their original and flagship restaurant. The quality of dishes appears to be amng the best amongst the Din Tai Fung branches. I like the Xiao Long Bao (above average), egg fried rice (very good) and soups
3
Not much choice I can have at Ding Tai Fung. The fried rice & Xiao Long Bao are quite nice. I like the sour & spicy soup. The ramen there quite standard as well. It always has long queue so be prepared for at least 30mins queue during dinner time
4
After arriving in Singapore, we were informed that a free shuttle bus to Paragon was available. After an hour rest we went there. Went straight to the food court and saw Din Tai Fung. We liked the Xiao long bao, sticky rice with pork but not the peking duck wrap.We arrived around 2pm and the place was not busy
1
Din Tai Fung shot to fame when the NYT named it one of the Top 10 restaurants in the world. Which is really funny, considering that what they serve is typical Chinese restaurant food. Besides, if you want to try local Chinese cuisine, this is NOT it. All the overhype has produced is ridiculously long queues, poor service for mediocre food. Try a local Chinese restaurant instead: any restaurant in the Crystal Jade or Imperial Treasures chain, any local seafood restaurant or any 'zhi-char' stalls in a local kopitiam (coffeeshop) or hawker centre
4
Yummy small bites of a variety of stuff - but be prepared to wait for your turn in the long queue outside
5
One of my most favorite restaurants in all of Asia. This place can never go wrong. Definitely get the pork buns, they are the best.
5
There are several branches of this Taiwanese restaurant located in Singapore. From Marina Bay sands to Sentosa to several on Orchard rd. Their food is excellent and the service very efficient.
4
A number of these restaurants in Singapore, mostly in Orchard area. Taiwanese origin. Food is consistently good at reasonable price. The outlet in Paragon Shopping Centre (basement) is particular good.
4
Food is good but should cater to tastebuds of Chinese more. Heard that the Taiwan outlets serve even more delicious dishes compared to those here though
5
Tried this restaurant in the Paragon Food Court. It was great as expected from the awards. Enjoyed various dim sum and loved the dumplings.
4
Definitely a must... especially when they have like 7 in Singapore. You have to try the soup dumplings when you hit a Din Tai Fung. Also try the wontons in spicy sauce. They are fantastic!
4
Love their XLB, always worth the wait (and you will have to wait). Their sides are good but it's the delicious soup parcels that are worth the queue.
1
I was at the Wisma Atria branch just after 9pm tonight for dinner. The restaurant was not crowded but the service level was just appalling. I waved frantically for a good two minutes before my order was taken. Then despite me marking clearly on the order chit, the waiter made a mistake on one of the three dishes I ordered. When I requested for tea to be topped up, it took another minute and a half. Pepper was missing from my table - that took two minutes and another three to get red cut chilli. By the time my 3rd side dish arrived, we already finished our main course. The best part was, in a hurry to wrap up my dinner, a waitress lifted an empty plate over my head! All the rave about this restaurant - my first visit and I am sure it'll be my last! To top it all, none of the staff in the restaurant was even aware of the service lapses and make any attempt of service recovery! Amazing
3
It took me a moment to realize this is the same resto as in Arcadia, CA as the quality is not as good, nor are the options as good. However, it always seems to have a line/queue and it seems that locals are satisfied with the offered fare
2
The warmest that is lacking. When in Taiwan, it always busy but staff is attentive/
2
I know better place with similar food, not the best place... This is my last choice.
5
It may be a chain, but Din Tai Fung never fails to please when it comes to having good dim sum and chinese food like mian (noodles). A staple favourite for my husband and I, and at very good prices.
5
Din Tai Fung is really one of the best for its kind of restaurant. Its xiao long pau is delicately made and smooth. Its free-flow chinese tea offering is also excellent.
4
The food is of qood quality. Ingredients are fresh and the dumplings are made on the premises.
5
This is a Chinese Dim Sum like restaurant chain. We saw it in several places in Singapore. There was always a queue in front so the place must be good. The food was good and tasty, but what is even better is the staff. They are prompt, attentive and very courteous. Our baby was always presented a set of bowl and folk and water whenever we went there (we ate at the restaurant, different locations, 3 times for our 4 days trip which is pretty crazy). High chair is always provided promptly when request. We ate there late one night and saw the staff cleaning up the area. We were pretty impressed with their cleanliness and service. Thumbs up
3
Don't get me wrong -- you can't really go wrong with Din Tai Fung. Dumplings and shumai have a relatively high floor. But this DTF doesn't hold a candle to other branches; Beijing's DTF is head and shoulders above this low-ceilinged outlet in the basement of a shopping mall. I would eat here again, but only if you're paying
3
I find Singapore food to be just so-so (yes, I know some will sorely disagree). I had just returned from Shanghai were I had some fabulous pan fried soup dumplings and was happy to hear that a group had decided to go here. Yes, lots of dumplings, but they seemed a little bland compared to the gems in Shanghai. Okay if you have a dumpling craving, but nothing too spectacular once you've had the real thing
2
The food is not as great - they are way too oily. And menu is limited to fried rice, chinese noodles and dumplings - trust me, for those who are not Chinese, the food is not great. there are better ones at the same price or slightly higher, e.g. Crystal Jade
5
This is one of the must-eats for my family every time we visit Singapore. We don't stray much from the staple steamed xiaolongbao's, drunken chicken, and noodles with chicken broth, and the place never disappoints. Lately we have discovered wontons in hot and sour sauce, and they are absolutely delicious. Can't seem to find anything approaching the ones served at Din Tai Fung anywhere else (and believe me, we've tried...).This is a place with a limited menu, and if you come for the right things, then you won't be disappointed
3
average dim sum, cold atmosphere, basic service, if nothing else is open go for it
4
Taiwanese style-just love the Dim Sums. Be ready to stand in lines to get in if you dont reach early before meal times
3
Great way to eat and experience the local cuisine of xiaolongbao or steamed buns - worth a visit
4
"Xia long pao" super good but I think the standard has dropped a bit recently. Not as good as 3 years ago. The fried rice is a must try item too.
3
Their Dim Sum is OK, but I like Crystal Jade (everywhere) or Lao Beijing (Plaza Singapura) better.
5
Love absolutely everything on this menu. It is my 2 and 4 year olds favourite restaurant in Singapore
3
Service was disappointing. Asked to change order 2 min after ordering and was told I was not allowed to as the food was already prepared. Restaurant was pretty packed then and food came 20 min after.Food was not memorable. Much prefer the la mien at Crystal Jade and Imperial.
3
Been to two of their foreign outlets and the food taste exactly alike. The shiao lung pao are best eaten when they are still hot, once it gets cold, the skin taste a bit rubbery. The fried rice with shredded pork and egg is consistenly delicious, be it in taipei or in singapore. Arrive early to avoid the long que, it took us a stunning 60 minutes wait to be seated. I don't know if it's still worth the wait for good food
5
Very ordinary restaurant with excellent dim sum. We have visited this restaurant many times - in Taipei and Singapore-and every time was excellent. This restaurant is very popular and in the evening you have to wait for the place. But it is very quick,we have never wait for longer time than 10-15 minutes. You get the menu card and you have to choose and order your meal in advance
5
Although this is a chain of restaurants, I always enjoy myself when I dine at DTF (as it is affectionately known). The standard of the food is always very high and service quick although a bit perfunctory. I love the fried rice with slivers of pork - so succulent! - and the dumplings in marinated chicken stock are so yummy! The xiao long bao are pretty good although the red bean and yam paste versions are unqiue to DTF and are always worth a try! Overall, a great place for a comforting meal, although the ambience can be quite noisy with the crowd!
3
The Shanghaiese siow loong pow is good. As for the rest of the food, it is generally ok.
5
The Dumplings here are excellent! Recommend also the Fried Rice with Shredded Pork and Egg.
4
Love the dumplings--just like the originals in Beijing. Service is fast and great to see them making the dumplings in front of you.
5
Best xiao long bao in Singapore. Although every Din Tai Fung has a long queue, the staff are very fast.
5
I love eating here......the dumplings are absolutely out of this world.....Great Stuff!
3
It look delicious but have not try it before.I would like to try it when i go there again.
5
If you are in Singapore you can't miss eating at one of the Din Tai Fung restaurants. The dumplings are amazing and you should also try the pork with fried rice. The only thing is that there is always a queue, but it's worth to wait
5
The pork dumplings here are the best...skin is paper thin and full of juicy goodness. Other must tries are the spicy wontons, hot and sour soup, noodles with beef brisket. Staff here and the one at Nex mall, always very efficient and friendly. Best thing is the food here is fast and consistently good. Go there if all you can spare is a quick pit stop.P.S. we dine at DTF at least twice a month
5
We have always had quick fast service, consistently good food at Din Tai Fung, making it one of our favorite restaurants. The steamed dumplings with soup inside, the garlic flavored kailan, and also the noodles, such as Dandan men and minced pork noodles are not to be missed
4
I had the best time in original Din Tai Fung in Taiwan, so my expectation was high, both in food quality and service level.Singapore Din Tai Fung had same great food, but service was not. I had to ask multiple times to get extra ginger or refill tea. Simple requests took them at least 5 minutes. It was crowded time, but in Taiwan, they always serve with smile. In Singapore, they gave us good sigh! I know they are tired and all, but I hope they don't show it to customers. :)Still, food was great. Maybe service is better when there are fewer customers
4
everything is not bad, except for the time of serving the food can be a little long somtime.
2
Not sure if i went to the wrong branch or the chef was not in the mood, tried a few dishes with my mum and bro but none was nice. Did not eat again from DTF ever since
1
Good food but you can get them elsewhere at a fraction of the price.
4
The xiaolongbao, fried rice with egg and shrimp, and chicken soup are my favorites. Plus great service for the staff - a little cubby for your bags and kids' cutlery/high chairs provided.¬†
5
The long queues are worth the wait. The staff are efficient, the food is delicious and less oily than their competitors.
5
The food gets better. Deserves the 1 Michelin star. Try the fried rice with pork chop and xiao long bao. The chicken soup is great as well.
3
I would say their steam dumpling bun is not to be missed in case you decided to really go for the long queue.... My personal fav is the "Hong yiu chao shou" Bascially its just dumpling in chilli oil however they dont serve this in every branch
4
Din Tai Fung has a limited menu but what they do, they do well. The xiao long pau is the best I have ever eaten and the fried rice with pork chop awesome. Service is quick and its our default restaurant to go to in Bishan when we are cathing a movie there. Only gripe is if you don't eat pork, they is not a lot of other meat options
4
We had a "dim sum" brunch here, and we are very impressed with the quality of the food and the speed of the service: the restaurant runs like clockwork and it is a very busy place.When you arrive, you must get a number in the counter and wait outside the restaurant. We had to wait for 20 minutes.This will not endear the place to parents with small children, or to people in need of a quick dumpling fix. The service is attentive, albeit very fast and almost mechanical - many of the servers are not fluent in English, so it's wise to talk to the hostess if you require something with your meal.The servings are of a reasonable size, but we suggest you skip breakfast and go straight for a nice sampling of all sorts of wonderful delights - the pork ribs in chicken broth are really good
4
well known for the dumpling xiao long bao, this restaurant has proved that simple is the best. To open the course, try their appetizer "Xiao Cai" which is not only yummy but also healthy. Prove it yourself that the noodle with special sauce, no meat, with only a sprinkle of spring onion and soy sauce..or..Egg Fried Rice is worth the saying 'Simple is the Best''.
3
This taiwan place is famous for its dumpling and it stops there. There are few selections on the menu and I rather visit Crystal jade for more variety.
However, if you are craving for Dumpling, this is the place to visit.
5
Simple food, but nice. Great service, polite staff and fast service. The price is afforable, about $35 to $50, depending on what you order. They even provide a canvas bag for you to place your bags in, so to keep it safe and clean.
3
Funnily, its food taste differently at various branches. Some good, some bad, some you think you'd cook better. I wonder if it could be the fork....
4
love the little soup dumplings, prepared with such precision to almost perfection
3
random food and boring. for simple and easy dining with friends.
5
Yummy dumplings, fried rice, noodle dishes and more. Always delicious and reasonably priced
3
The food is tasty, but the service is mediocre.
The noodles may be oily for some.
3
If you love dumplings, this is the place for you. Watch the chefs preparing them as you wait outside.
3
My mom simply loves Din Tai Fung, she would eat it everytime she sees it. There is also usually a big queue outside the restaurant. I am personally not a great fan. Din Tai Fung serves mainly "small dishes" like noodles, buns, dumplings, which to me is like a really expensive snack place. Food that I can probably get at half the price or even lower at coffee shops/food court. Not much difference in food quality for better coffee shops/food court. I don't mind paying for good food, but I just don't get it why people are willing to pay so much for street food. Perhaps the better part of Din Tai Fung is their steam dumplings which are made such that there is soup trapped in the dumplings, making it an experience when you eat the dumplings (do so with a spoon)
5
The food is consistently mouthwatering - just the thought conjures up droolsome images! The Dim Sum (the ones with the liqueous centre), the Chilli oil, Wontons in Black Vinegar, Hot n Sour Soup...all very, very superlative! How do they manage to dish out the same `taste' in every one of their outlets...I wonder
5
the dim sum here id as good as they do in China. always busy, always consistent
3
And they happened to be out of the veggie dumplings when I went! Even if you eat seafood it's hard to get anything that doesn't have pork in. The food is ok, just not great for non-meat eaters.
4
Best item on the menu in my opinion is the Chill Crab dumplings. Shame they only have this on the menu between July & August really.
5
They are the one of the only few F&B outlets in Singapore that provide exceptional service.
Very attentive and food was great!
4
Go during off peak hours for a quick bit, all dishes are consistently of a high quality, but does not worth the wait if there is a long queue.
5
The food here is great. The queues to get in to the one in Wisma Atria are crazy but once in, the food comes quickly and the standard is really consistent, we have been back many times and will continue.
5
This place is excellent. The food is great and they can usually get you seated quickly in spite of the long line of people waiting to taste the delicious treats. The atmosphere is loud and a bit rushed, but I go there for the food.
4
I love Din Tai Fung. I love the cleanliness - you can watch the chefs preparing the dumplings, the intricacies of the folding of the dumplings, the baskets they provide for you to put your handbags and small packages in etc. It's quite an experience and the food is delicious, if a little bit on the expensive side. Well worth a visit
5
Best xiao long bao and la mian I have taken ( I have eaten a lot). XLB still juicy inside with contents at the right temperature and with the right vinegar / ginger. LM is softer than the traditional version with soup exactly right between dan and nong.Best to go before 12 or after 2. (The branch in Jurong Point is not as good on these 3 criteria.
5
One of my favourite places to eat in Singapore. The classic Xiao Long Bao are to die for. Go to long without these and I literally have cravings. DTF is always busy and you always have to wait a bit for a table (the most I have waited is 20 minutes) but it is definitely worth it
5
I really liked the wide variety of chinese dishes. It is a great cheap option and i recommend it highly
4
Some of the dumpling skin still consider very thick, especially with crab meat one. Can be better n improve for the above mentioned.
4
we always visit the restaurant. Simple, reliable, chinese food. And they taste good.
4
Hearty but not as fine as I would have liked. There is always a queue which is not always due to lack of seats but to the delay of them seating the guests. It is hard to get good beef soup noodle and their dish with rich broth is better fare than those served at food court and kopitiams but otherwise, the rest of the dishes are not exceptional and comparable to the other noodle houses, and not specially worth queuing for
3
I love the xiao long bao and la mians at din tai fung, but every time I have a meal at one of their restaurants it feels as though I'm eating in a fast food chain - in and out within 30 mintes, tops 45 minutes. Really not much of an ambience and I'm never at ease while in their restaurants. I can't even sit for 10 minutes to enjoy a cup of tea after dinner without feeling as though I'm rushed out of the restaurant by the waitresses.
2
Service was brusque at best and the skins of the truffle xiaolongbao were dry and brittle. This is far from the silky 'perfect thickness' dumpling available elsewhere in Singapore. I know these guys are capable of better but this place is not up to the standard of Din Tai Fung franchises elsewhere. It might only be this store as well. Firmly in the 'need to do better' column
4
As with all other DTF around the world... there is a queue for this place but since we got there early, we didnt have to wait for too long.We ordered quite a few of the dishes and the highlight was the drunken chicken and the XLB. The beef soup was nice the meat seems tough, I had better in their Taipei & HK branches.Overall it was enjoyable and would recommend it
5
i am from India and tried the Din Tai Fung at the Paragon mall on a Visit to Singapore late August. ( I dragged my veggie-only brother along for the eating too !) The dumplings just melt in your mouth and are packed so full of great taste and flavor. It was just amazing .. little round balls of heaven exploding the moment you bite into it ! I am back in India and still cant stop thinking about them ! To Din Tai Fungs management : i know it would be hard to open a branch in Mumbai, ..but if you ever need someone to champion the cause .. i am in 
4
Din Tai Fung is very popular for its shanghai dumplings (dumplings with soup). The food are great. However, due to a lot of people eat here - lines and service are pretty bad. They don't accept reservations and expect around 30 minutes waiting time beforeyou can be seated. If you arrive early or late during lunchtime or dinner, you might be seated instantly. Noodles with soup are also great
4
Din Tai Fung is mostly known for its excellent Xiao Long Bao but I discovered that they also have some other terrific dishes like Fried Rice with Pork Chops and Steamed Shrimp and Pork Dumplings. The service is good, price is just right considering the excellent quality of the food (around $15-20 SGD per person), and the dishes are truly to die for.This is truly one of the best SG treats we had. There are other branches in Wisma Atria and Resorts World but we heard that the one in Paragon Mall is the best. We ate here around 2:00 pm so there's no queue. Eat here if you are into dimsums, dumplings and rice
4
good service
4
The price is a bit steep, but overall the food is alright.
4
air-conditioning didn't work. was really warm in there. argh.
2
prefer the one i visited in taiwan with my family ;p
4
I love the Xiao Long Bao!
4
The food was delicious, the service was friendly and fast, price was ok. The ambiance was rather neutral and boring and there tables were rather close together and it was crowded. But alltogether a good place to get good food, relative fast and at a good price. Ordering is quite an experience, you get a list with the items on it and then your write down what you want and how often. Then the cooks will come by your table and deliver what they've just have ready
5
We have had food at many Din Tai Fung's before and are always happy! We tried the one in Wisma Atrium as well as Paragon Shopping Centre on this asia trip. We have pretty much eaten us up and down the menu by now but always come back to the classic dumplings and fried rice with grilled pork. The service is always fantastic and the restaurant is spotless clean as usual. Good value for money for Singapore prices
4
I thought I would put in this review since visitors always ask where to eat. There are some excellent Chinese restaurants in Singapore, but it can be difficult to send guests that don't know Chinese food well and explain how to navigate the menu. They have a couple of locations- Raffles City, Paragon and Somerset 313.Quality is very good. Hard to go wrong here
5
This restarant was recommended by a frequent visitor to Singapore. I'm so glad we tried Din Tai Fung. The food was fantastic! Soup Dumplings were my favorite, but we also loved the red bean dumplings and the spicy cucumber. It's fun to watch the cooks working in the steamy kitchen (though I'm not sure I'd like to be in there all day!).Service was fast and efficient, and the restaurant was spotless
5
Not sure what some of the other reviews had to eat BUT everything we enjoyed at Din Tai fung was delicious. During a 12 day wedding adventure trip in 2008(our son) the first meal after arriving from a very long flight was here. The signature soup dumplings blew me away, how perfectly cooked and simply wonderful. We hadn't planned on going back twice more, it just happened with different groups. Not matter what we ordered, it was amazing. Yes, we waited about 20-30 minutes each time to be seated, but it was worth the wait. Our daughter in law is from Singapore and as she said, Din Tai fung is a favorite of the locals! One night 11 people dined for under $150USD !!!!!!! Several locations make it a great option in Singapore. We are heading back again this year and you can be sure we will enjoy a meal at Din Tai Fung
5
Top choice for Xiao l√≥ng bƒÅo literally "little basket bun" also known as soup dumpling.
3
fried rice with chicken chop is fragrant and light, one of the nicest i have tasted. and of course the xiao long baos.
3
Taiwan is much better
2
The xiao long bao their signature dish. quite pricey....small portions of noodles.
3
Really love their egg and prawn fried rice
4
In terms of XLB, it's pretty good, esp the Yam paste XLB. However, i think the Crystal Jade at Taka 5th floor is better.
3
Xiao long bao but cannot compare to the actual in taipei
5
yummyliscious!
2
Over-hyped for its imported foreign brand. Taste almost the same as other Chinese Dumplings restaurants all over Singapore. Not worth the queuing during peak meal hours.
2
Xiao Long Bao is only average (I dont know what the hype is abt), the fancier Xiao Long Baos are worse, skin too thick to accomodate other fillings. Beef noodles and Zha Jiang Mian is alright/average. BUT the fried rice is superb, very delicious. Chicken soup is very nice too
3
nice xiao long bao but it pretty much stops there.
5
i always enjoy eating here. Their chinese pickled salad is my favourite dish. Their fresh made noodles and dumplings are excellent.
3
There are cheaper and better ones around.
2
Better xiaolongbao can be found in other restaurants. And there's no other reason to be here...
3
Love their Xiao Long Baos but other than that there are nothing much to eat from Din Tai Feng already...
3
love the xiao long bao! think crystal jade has better la mian though.
3
Xiao long bao and Fried prawncake
3
dim sum is very good but not sure abt the rest of the food. i think it's quite average
3
Went to the one in Raffles Place. Yummy noodles + broth
3
You cannot ignore the fact that the xiao long bao is of the best that I have tried in Singaproe so far. Those with a big appetite should order the fried rice topped with a piece of pork cutlet. The noodle dishes however do not stand out too much unless you just want a simple meal
5
Love the xiao long baos
3
Pretty ordinary...
2
Not sure if there were improvements since I went there years back...
4
Dumplings...yummy!
4
served good beef stewed soup with handmade noodles
4
Fried rice, xiao long bao and pork rib noodles
4
Best Dim Sum in town
2
Small serving and food not as good as crystal jade xiao long bao. Overpriced. Its popular xiao long bao is also not as good.
3
Not as great as what it claims to be but nevertheless decent food
2
Overrated.
4
the crabmeat xiao long bao and chicken soup is great!
5
The best xiao long bao!
2
Over-rated
1
whatever happen to their reviews.... its doesnt tally AT ALL!
2
I have tasted better xiao long bao else where (in S'pore).
2
Dumplings are over-rated, noodles not very much to be desired. Not totally impressed
1
The xiao long bao wasn't nice. The ones I tried at Din Tai Fung in Taipei were much better, so I'm boycotting this restaurant in Singapore.
4
the xiao long bao rocks!
2
xiao long bao is good. Everything else is so-so.
3
Go for the xiao long bao.
4
Place for xiao long bao and la mian.
5
You cant get any better for a plate of fried rice anywhere other than here.
4
Nice Xiao Long Bao.. although the one at taipei is even better. :P
4
I love the fact they actually give you instructions how to eat the dumplings ;)
4
Juicy steamed dumplings at reasonable prices
3
I think the food is ok; prefer crystal jade, but was surprised when i went to shanghai and there was a huge line outside the branch in xintiandi..wow..even the Chinese from China love it
3
good
4
I would go just for the xiao long bao! The siew mai is also quite unusual.
4
I love the La mIan and Xiao Long Bao
2
Found the soup in the acclaimed xiao long bao less savoury than Crystal Jade's
