Very good food and wine at very reasonable prices (by Singapore standards). We needed to send one underdone ‘medium’ steak back to the kitchen which was a little disappointing, but it was handled very professionally. All the food was very good.

The service was terrible it is a shame for what could be such a great restaurant, don't go if service is an important part of dinning out for you

Amazing steak and wine. Quality comparable to the ridiculously high end steak places in Singapore and at a fraction of the cost. Unlimited fries and salad.. perfect.
Place is relaxed and non pretentious. Always great food.

Ordered the rib eye steak. Comes with a bowl of salad, a bread with butter, and free flow fries, though the servings are big enough so you don't need to top up the fries. Nice, cozy ambience, good service. Would come again.

I was really excited about dining at this place, given all the rave review all over the Internet. Prior to the date, there was a reminder for the reservation which is excellent. When we arrived, we were greeted by a man wearing long sleeves who got his co worker to bring us upstairs. This co worker was not rude at first but toward the end, he seemed a little grumpy. Was it because I didn't order any wine, unlike the other customers? When I enquired about the selection of beer, he wasn't that forthcoming. I would appreciate more information. I'm wondering if it's because of his command of language. He does not seem to understand me very well. This really spoils my dinner, to be honest. The ribeye was delicious. The fries, less so. Towards the end, I got a little sick from eating the fries which is too oily. This is the place to visit if you want a fun night out. Do make your reservation because the restaurant can get a little full.

Always an amazing food experience no matter what dishes I order. The menu is fantastic and the ingredients of great quality! The meat is unbelievable with flavor, tenderness and the fries that go with much better than what most restaurants serve usually! Great place to take friends, dates or for business meals. Service is very good too and the selection of wine exactly what that nice meat requires. One of my favorites
5
Service was friendly and attentive. (They even walked down the street and borrowed a table and chair form another establishment to accommodate a couple that wanted to be seated) The Prime Rib was cooked to perfection, they even asked if I had a preference about the marbling on the meat. It was melt in your mouth bite after bite.The value for the dining experience was perfect for some one traveling with some what of a budget

This is a nice little steak place along Ann Siang hill. First time visit as it was picked by a good friend for our regular catch up lunch. My friend has been to the place and I just trusted his recommendations. We ordered the steak filet. It is a steak that comes with a bowl of mixed salad and home made potato fries. For sides, we shared a cream spinach. The waiter recommended our steak to be medium and it was good. Tender and juicy. There was 2 types of mustard and 2 types of sauces for the meat and fries (no ketchup though!). The spinach was very nice, creamy and tasty. There was also a basket of 2 bread rolls and butter (we passed on the bread as we just wanted to try the steak and eat as little carb as possible. So we also went easy on the potato fries.The restaurant is quite small, cosy and casual. Estimated seating capacity is around 16 inside and another 4 more outside. It was quite full and I would recommend reservations as it is quite popular place. The service is attentive and friendly. Overall, I find it a very nice comfortable place to talk and catch up with friends and family over a good meal. Should be back for a visit in future. In the meantime, we will continue our adventure in visiting other food places along Ann Siang Hill and Club Street locality to undercover/discover nice eating joints and great food

This is probably my favorite normal steak house in Singapore. They have two outlets: one on Ann Siang Road, which I'm reviewing here, and one in Robertson Quay. I find this one to be the slightly better of the two, though they have the same menu and the quality is nearly identical. It's basically a classic steak frites restaurant. It is not a cheap place to dine but it's not overly expensive, either, especially when compared to the fancier steak houses in Singapore. They also have to most reasonable wine prices of any restaurants I know here. On the whole, I find their appetizers to be somewhat average in quality, but the steaks are very good. They have a few non-steak options, as well, including the couscous royale on Fridays and weekend, but it's primarily a steak place. Steaks come with a fairly filling salad, as well as all-you-can-eat fries, which I think are the best in Singapore. You also get unlimited sauces. The desserts are decent and similar to those you get at L'Angelus, which is part of the same restaurant group. I also like the good service and laid-back atmosphere

Made a reservation for a steak meal with a buddy. We ordered a bone marrow appetiser and a cote de boeuf to share. The food was good and so was the house red. Above average. We had to ding the rating for the restaurant for the unconventional service received. After our orders were taken, we were left to ourselves for quite a bit as the restaurant filled up and the orders of the other patrons were taken. This was fine as it gave us the opportunity to talk and catch up with each other.I thought it strange that we did not get any bread. And when the next table got salads, I thought they had ordered them separately and that our meal did not come with salads, also another strange point.The bread did eventually arrive and the salads came together with the steaks. It would have made more sense to have served these earlier so they could be eaten when we had so much time. Also, how was it that the next table got their bread and salads sooner than we even though they came later. We did not raise the issue as it didn't bother us but I feel other diners may not take it like this if it were to happen to them

Nice place to eat a french menu in singapore. Very nice wine card at affordable prices for singapore. Excellent champagne !
5
Nice atmosphere: not big, service is good, the beef meat excellent and I have eaten one of the best french fries in Singapore.
If I have to find a cons, I would say quite expensive. But quality has a price.

Went there recently for a family dinner. We ordered a bottle of French red which was reasonably priced and drinkable.Sadly the appetizers leave much to be desired. The escargot was ordinary and surprisingly was perhaps the better of the 3 starters wHixh included the bone marrow and Terrine, the latter being the first Terrine iBhave ever eaten. How so? The Terrine had a weird chemical tasty and I know not where this could have originated from. The chemical character being very unsavoury, was made worse and compounded by the fact that the Terrine was very dehydrated which seemed to have been kept improperly in a fridge for a long time which also account for the dried texture and the stale taste.We had 2 servings of their signature rib eye on a bone. Despite us asking for them to be cooked to medium, they came out rare! Not sure if this the French's interpretation of a medium cooked steak but when we are in Spore and perhaps the Spore interpretation should prevail.The steaks came with limitless French fries. My son said they were fried in duck fats as they had a deep shade of brown color to the fries like when the fried are over fired, but they are not as this could be due to the use of animal fats mixed in the frying oil. The fries were soft and not crispy or crunchy as we would prefer freshly cooked fries!The steaks aside from being underdone although were acceptable, were nothing close to a culinary exposÃ© to remember by.The service was pleasant.Total price for 5 including a normal bottle of French red came to abt Sgd 410. No cheap by the quality of the food served.Food Appetizers 1.5/5Food Signature Rib eye 2.5/
3
I had lunch there with a group and had the rib-eye steak with fries.The salad as started was ok.The steak was good, but not exceptional. It was cooked as required (medium-rare) and well seasoned but it lacked that extra flavour. 4 stars for it.The fries were awful. Most of them were almost burnt and the others soggy.For the price it is 3/5
4
Just went back to Les Bouchon for dinner . This must be my fifth visit or moreAll time Favourite steakhouse n free flow Super tasty fries (really good). Ribeye for 300gm is a steal for the price that comes with salad. Impressive yet decently priced red French wine. Menu may be small but taste n quality supersede. My birthday boy didn't get anything special tho even though I put it on reservations and reminded service staff. A little letdown.The other thing is wish is that you have more tables available and to start your service before 7pm so that we can enjoy a longer dinner

I was there on the 30 June to have a surprise birthday celebration for my wife and was not known that it was not a family friendly restaurant as I was bring our kids and no children high chair were available. I was happy when the staff Kristhel and Irene was there as they help make our night a very eventful one. Their presences was great as their service were top notch. they assisted me with the cake that i made fro my wife and play with our kids so that my family of 11 could enjoy the beautifully cooked beef offered at Le Bouchons. Sorry to the couple on their first date that we were noisy. PS: If you Love Beef This is the place to be!!
5
Went there to celebrate my son birthday. Very nice place with pretty authentic French bistro atmosphere. Friendly staff with special mention to the manager for his kindness and nice gesture for my son's birthday. Real good meat perfectly cooked by the French chef!All meals come with a nice mesclum salad and French fries. Tried three different apetizers and one creme brulee as a desert and must say that all was very good. Worth the money

Every service encounter, such as ordering a drink, or asking for mustard when our steaks arrived, was a problem / headache to one waiter there, whom unfortunately, had to be our waiter. We were two ladies (30 year old professional and 40 year old mommy-of-two) made to feel belittled and uncomfortable at every interaction, including from the on-site manager, who referred to himself as "The most senior staff in the group". I would not recommend unless you're going out of your way to experience obnoxious service, coupled with cold food. Please note: I tried to do right by the restaurant and provide this feedback to them direct (given we were seasoned patrons of their old and new rob quay outlet, and, given that people do have off days).Management response: The Managers' apology was followed by saying his team informed him that they provided us excellent service, went out of their way catering to our needs and that he trusted them (indirectly saying that we were lying). Understanding that it's true, customers can and do unfortunately lie, we certainly were not, and so we kindly wished him well and told him he'd indefinitely lost two customers. Clearly now, we both, and another friend who arrived later, are determined to share this experience in order to save others going through the same. I hope you found this review helpful

Les Bouchons is an all-time favourite for us.....been going there for several years now. The ambience is great, though I will say that the new addition (more seating upstairs) is a far cry from the ground floor setting.Service is always very friendly and attentive (with rare lapses, and that's great considering the shortage of staff this country faces). There's no need for appetisers as the steak frites meal comes with a decent sized salad. On ocassions (not this time though), we've had the escargots to start and it's yummy. As always, this time round we had the extra tender beef fillet done medium rare, and it was perfect. The frites are to die for, skinny and crispy (not overly so that it is dry) and if you don't have enough, you can always order another portion (it's free flow). Highly recommended. Reservations are absolutely a must

We decided to make a return visit, this time choosing to sit inside the small dining area rather than dining alfresco.To start, we shared a platter of charcuterie (assorted cold cuts) which was simple. For our entree, we opted for their house special of 1 kg cote de boeuf to share between two of us The beef was cooked just the way we wanted, medium rare and it was juicy served with the usual condiments although I prefer wholegrain mustard while my husband likes it with horse radish. Accompanying the steak were bowls of mixed salad and free flow of home made french fries. We were served a big portion of fries but they were rather thin and overcooked. We did not enjoy them as much as before so we left half untouched. Corkage was charged at $30++ per bottle. Service was fine but not as attentive as before with one staff firmly planted behind the bar counter.The cote de boeuf was charged at $50++ per head so total cost of dinner amounted to around $175 including the usual taxes. We are not sure whether we will come back and may probably try other restaurants that served cote de boeuf, just because of the french fries, really
4
Nice beef from AUSTRALIA with on top an excellent cooking for those who like rare steaks as well typical French fries !
4
One of the better steak places in Singapore with a more quant and local atmosphere. Endless supply of French fries is a nice touch.
5
We love this restaurant. Simple menu - steak, chips and salad. All absolutely delicious and good value for money. If you are looking for a relaxed steak dinner with a glass of wine then this is the best place to go to.
4
Good quality steak, freshly made fries, diverse wine menu and all around good value for money. This restaurant has been around for years and delivers every time. Always a safe bet for social or business dining.
5
A fantastic little restaurant in the beautiful Ang Siang Rd, best valued and tasting steak, great service, highly recommend!
4
The interior of the place was well decorated and gave a sort of a homely feel which was quite comfortable. We ordered a Ribeye and Sirloin Steak respectively (Medium) which was cooked to the way we wanted it. The ribeye was abit more tender then the Sirloin which might be due to the cut of the meat. The steaks were well seasoned and big in portion. Served along as the sides were free flow of their home cooked French fried which received outstanding reviews from my partner. They tasted fresh and was seasoned well. They served a light body fruity house red for only 14$ a glass which was quite refreshing to have with my steak.Definitely recommend this place as one to go if you are looking for places to have your steak. Well priced (39$) for a big juicy piece of steak.
5
The hand-made fries are excellent and it is so rare nowadays to find a restaurant that prepares their own fries. The meat is of high quality too. On Friday and Saturday, they even offer couscous, which is so hard to find in Singapore. Lastly, they get their ice cream from one of the best ice cream makers in Singapore. The pricing is identical to other steak restaurants in Singapore
1
Went the on a Saturday night, the restaurant don't take phone reservation until 6pm. The restaurant only open @ 7pm.Arrived 7pm, we are the only customer but the manager only start notice our present 15 min later.The steak served was over cook and poor quality.The manager certainly don't know what is hospitality means to customer spending most time behind counter talking to the colleagues.Totally disappointed! Never go back again
2
I was looking forward to having a steak here as another meal alternative at Robertson Quay. We had 2 steaks which were a bit fatty, fries that we bordering on soggy and a carafe of house red for $160. Wait staff did not know what the house red was, did not supply plates for the bread and I thought it was odd that I had to pay for the sauce. I did not feel it was good value for money and will go back to L'Entrecote at Duxton Hill for my steaks
3
No Starter ( a free house salad), No Desert, a Fillet, an EntrecÃ´te, a portion of Creamed Spinach, and a Blue Cheese Sauce (which was more like Bechamel). Washed down with a Caraf of house red, $200 later and I was disappointed! Can't think of a reason to return
4
This is a very nice place if you want a French restaurant in Singapore
The food is good and of course the wine is ok because this I s French :)
Good service
Very small dining room so you'd better make a reservation
5
Good service, tasty food with generous portions, and nice atmosphere. Nothing bad, just that portions might be a bit too big for small eaters.
5
We ordered the escargot for a starter but I am not exactly a fan of escargot in the first place. But it is worth a try as the taste is really strong and not bad! We also order rib eye and sirloin.Ribeye: It was super buttery, but more tender than Sirloin. I think that the taste of the butter is very overpowering and it somewhat covered the taste of the ribeye. But still, good! I like the texture, but not so much for the taste.Sirloin: A bit tougher than Ribeye but I love the taste of the herb! Some parts of the sirloin is cooked, rather than "Medium" that i ordered. But overall, I like to taste, not so much for the texture. But the fries is good and the portions are huge!! Could not finish the fries and I almost could not finish the steak! We spent $140 for that meal. Its nice and will recommend to friends! :
4
Lovely location on club street, visited here on Tuesday evening, so it was nice and quiet. Sat outside which was still pretty cool under the fans.Was given bread and a complimentary bowl of salad, waiter was quite patient and attentive, especially as it seemed as though he was looking after the diners inside as well.Ordered the rib-eye $38 rare, was delicious. It did come out particularly fast though, but no real complaints when you’re hungry I suppose.Total meal for two came to $100, which is pretty reasonable. Would definitely try here if you are looking for steaks on a budget
4
Brought my wife for a birthday meal there recently.A very small place, quite quaint. Their website seemed a little confusing, but there are 3 types/styles at the same location - which we discovered when we got there early and walked around.This is more a family type place, and menu was more limited. They had other varieties but not exactly what I wanted nor preferred.Ribeye was not bad but their extra tender fillet, was overdone, despite calling for a medium-well.Free flow of fries were great- tastes great tho I never got a chance to al for 2nd round! Dessert was ok, as it is, ice cream and creme brûlée were very sweet. Great for folks with sweet-tooth. The other branch that does finer-dining and a better extensive menu may perhaps fair better? (Well with variety anyway
5
On the search for meat around Chinatown we passed Les Bouchons. The meat cuts were a nice suprise, cooking grade matched the request. Since we skipped the fries (yeah again on low carb) the salad was a super pairing - and enough!We had very attentive waiters - a nice ad-on in Singapore
3
The items on the menu was limited as expected since they are known for steak. The steak was good and cooked just nice. The portion was big too. The fries wasnt great, it was overcooked. Creme brulee was worth trying but it wasn't as great as the hype for it seems to be. I stated that it was for a birthday but nth was done. Good that i didnt go with much expectations. You can go once to try the steak but nothing to rave about.
4
We came here for dinner a few times when we had cravings for steak and fries. The outlet at club street is abit noisy however the potted plants make the outdoor seatings quite cosy and private.For starters, we had the salmon and the caprese. For mains, we had the ribeye and beef fillet served with fries and for desserts, we had the chocolate and hazelnut ice-cream. We have no complaints about the food here as they are pretty decent and we enjoyed the ice-creams very much.Service by the staff was also very professional and warm
4
Went here for dinner last Saturday. Nice little French bistro. Had the Terrine Maison With Pork & Chicken Liver as a starter. Although it was very nice I found it over-priced at $18.80++ especially considering it was served with only 2 small rolls of cheap ciabatta style bread. I would have expected it to be served with maybe...erm.....sliced French baguette. Anyway I had the ribeye and my wife had the sirloin. It was excellent. Very flavourful and cooked to perfection. It ws served with ...wait for it......frites. lol. they were ok and if you are hungry they are free-flow. The main course was was great value at only $39++. Had a bottle of wine which was reasonably priced. Oh and the service was really great too. I would definitely recommend this place
4
Our to-go place for good (and affordable) steaks. If we're not talking about Wagyu, Kobe, this is defo the best steak I've had. Decent ambience. Service is alright. However, I must emphasize that they serve absolute rubbish fries. Unfortunately, it's not a one-off thing. Probs 8 times out of 10 you're better off eating Maccas fries. Fries aside, we're satisfied with everything else.
5
Really good chips and refillable too, though I was too full to refill. Very tender steak. Shared several starters which are really tasty - escargots, cold cuts, cream spinach...
4
Nice rib eye cooked perfectly (medium rare). Creme brûlée and sorbet - can't go wrong. Good service.
4
I only patronise this place for its couscous and beef..love it! reservations are recommended for weekend dining as the place is a tat small..so they say...good things don't have to come big. Cheers Les Bouchons..
5
Cosy environment with attentive svc. Great food and presentation. Ribeye was excellent. The fries were too small and soft for personal liking.
4
The food was excellent. The wine was good. And the Creme brûlée was lovely. But the waiter seemed a bit in a hurry to clear our plates. But other than that it was lovely.
4
We were here to enjoy their cuisines on an afternoon. It's a nice and cozy restaurant with good food and nice service. Price also okay.
5
Great service, great steak and great wine and reasonably priced. The creme Brule was faantstic. I love going Les Bouchons.
5
This was an amazing place. The free flow fries are amazing (and I may have eaten too many) and the steak was perfect (especially with the horseradish cream). To top is off the dessert (Ile flottante maison) was light and sweet (exactly what was needed after the heavy meal) and the coffee was strong
5
Personally, their Rive Gauche outlet at Robertson Quay is my favourite, but this is the original. And it is the best steak in Singapore under $50. The extra tender beef fillet with the blue cheese sauce is incredible. And the homemade fries are free flow with your steak and are hard to say no to.
4
Great variety of steaks done in a Parisian-style setting! If you're a big fan of fries, then this is definitely the place for you as they offer free flow fries. The bone marrow is a superb choice for an entree and my personal favorite off their steak list is the Giant 1kg "Cote de Boeuf" (Prime Rib), excellent for sharing at a reasonable price
2
Order sirloin and ribeye for 2 of us.
Was expecting a good dinner but was very disappointed. Beef quality was bad. And really tough despite us ordering medium rare. Fries was bad too. Yikes! First and last visit there.
5
Always go back for the steak. This small place still serves amazing food. It's a regular for us. Thanks
4
Steak tends to be on the rarer side despite what you order, but juicy and a good size.
Fries are amazing, soft, well flavoured and with a great potato taste.
Creamed spinach was tasty.
Peach Melba was not worth talking about.
Service was impeccable.
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday at the restaurant. Provided us with nice, quieter table by the window. Had the ribeye steak! It was fabulous. I must say the escargots were heavenly too! Free flow of fries was really welcomed! :)
4
Dinner was ok but good atmosphere. Food service was quite slow. Had to wait around 30 minutes for the food.
5
Had a craving for steak and so we decided to give it try at Les Bouchons. The steak was fabulous plus we were overwhelmed by fries & salad . Affordable price range with good service and cosy ambience . Enjoyed our wine .
4
Stopped for dinner at Les Bouchons while in Singapore Chinatown. Ordered a steak for two and the housewine. The steak was very good and we enjoyed the evening, not at least also because of the friendly service and the nice ambience when sitting outside on Ann Siang Road. Definitely worthwhile to visit again in the future
4
I haven't been to Les Bouchons (Ann Siang) for a while but it didn't disappoint. The steak was as good as I remember - The Tender Beef Filet. I requested that we sit outside because I love the street dining feel of Ann Siang Road. As a result we were a little out of sight of the waiter. This combined with a busy night and a little short staffed meant service wasn't as fast as it could have been. However, the waiter was very nice and we had great company so it didn't matter too much. A good night
4
Had a lovely dinner at Les Bouchons. My Husband had a steak and I had the jumbo prawns. The prawns were jumbo indeed, fresh and delicious prepared. My husband's steak was well prepared too.The accompanying sauces were well prepared as well, in fact the pepper sauce was delicious. Free flow of delicious fries. Prices for the starters, mains & desserts were very reasonably priced. Drinks were also slightly cheaper than the bars nearby.The location was in a vibrant street. Lots of lovely bars around for after dinner drinks
4
Great value for the service and food portion. They would serve a salad before the main course. The salad was great, lots of vege and nuts season with balsamic vinegar(I think), we ordered the sirloin and rib eye, in medium rare. Tenderly cooked every cut piece was juicy. All come with free flow fries. We each took a glass of house pour wine.The staffs was friendly and helpful
5
Brought my gf out for her bday to Las Bouchons. I can say that it was a great, valuable evening.
The food was amazing, the atmosphere was great, the service was impeccable. Definitely look forward to coming back here, even if there's no occasion. =)
2
Average or below average steak..full of fat instead of meat..i don't think that i will visit the restaurant again. I have been to the one in club street
4
We ordered the ribs but it was more like a T bone steak. Was pretty gd. The staff were friendly and attentive. Free flow of fries was great but the fries could've been better.
5
Owner was accommodating to my request for a quiet corner. Food was excellent, but portion is too much!
4
Went for dinner at Les Bonchons Ann Siang. The restaurant is small but cozy. Was pleasantly surprised at how attentive the staff were. Food was pretty awesome as well!
Would definitely return :)
5
Great service and food served. The servers are all attentive and great ambience for couples as well as small group gathering.
5
Service crews were very attentive. While the fries were free-flow for the items we ordered, we didn't get more.
4
Of course, that's not all that Les Bouchons has to offer diners who are looking to satisfy their French food craving. But it does make a lovely come-on for those who are not worried about packing more carbs than usual. We were here for dinner a few nights ago. It was actually our first 'date' since having our baby 10 weeks ago. My husband and our friend ordered their 1kg ribeye steak with salad and unlimited frites, to share, and had more than what they bargained for. The two of them couldn't finish the entire kilo of medium rare meat fest but maintained that the meat was of good grade. Not a beef eater myself, I opted for the salmon main instead and I thought it was pretty good, too. I didn't get to try any of the wines on the menu because I am a breastfeeding mama, but I would like to think that they have a decent selection which I would love to try next time we visit. What won me over aside from the food was the intimate coziness of the place. Les Bouchons is by no means a large restaurant, with only a few tables inside and still a few more outside. The sombre lighting inside the restaurant makes it a great date option for couples or group of friends just wanting a relatively quiet night of good food and conversations. Food and drinks are a little on the mid to high side. Oh, and before I forget, service quality was excellent and the waiters were attentive and friendly
3
We ordered d'entrecote steak. They weren't very hot to begin with. Also my friend's medium rare was too rare. She compared it with mine which was also medium rare and it was indeed redder at the centre and tougher. The escargots was not very pleasant tasting. It had a queer smell.
5
Portion was big and the price is justified. Love the simplicity of the seasonings. Even the fries tasted different. However, the middle of the steak was slightly under cooked, still raw. Read other reviews and they advised to have your steak here done one degree higher, eg normally have it medium rare, order medium instead. But I didn't heed their advice. No harm though, still a great piece of steak. Staffs were friendly and attentive to customers needs. Love everything there.
5
Vigneron butter steak and the fries was really delicious. I will come back for more.
It is a small restaurant so you might not be able to hold a private conversation with your partner without constantly forced to eavesdrop the tables next to you.
4
Great little restaurant - good tasty steak. Wine good but stightly pricy. Nice atmosphere for long lunch
4
Another wonderful dinner of steak et frites. This restaurant continues to give personalized service and quality food. The wine list offers variety and has something for every budget. Good value for money. Good for business entertaining or family meals or romantic occasions.
4
Gr8 food and well cook cote de beouf. Service was very ordinary and nothing to crow about. Wine is exquisite and goes perfectly with the food. The bread buns was delicious too. Escargots are ordinary too.
5
Love the ambience - great food - awesome service by Bernard. Price is ok as their servings are huge :)
4
Went here for the first time recently with a group. Steak was very tasty and perfect for small bistro atmosphere. Start with the escargot. I would go back.
5
Excellent throughout. Have to commend a fine gentleman Mike for his unwavering professional service.
4
Great steak at not unreasonable prices! Lovely intimate little restaurant. Great date spot for that carnivore in your life. Service is prompt and efficient although a little surlier than one would expect for a restaurant this nice.
5
I reviewed steak restaurants online before leaving the UK and the booked this online. It's a little French restaurant in Chinatown in Singapore! Go figure!This was a birthday treat for my husband who is allergic to eggs so I had checked the menu beforehand but the staff were very helpful and we had a fantastic steak meal. Fairly simple - lots of stringy French Fries and a good bottle of red wine.It is pricey but then everything in Singapore is pricey
1
A nice setting in a lively part of Singapore. The steak was cooked well but hugely over priced. The wine was of poor quality and again very over priced. The service was the worst part of this dining experience I'd rather forget which was appalling, even for Singapore. Most definitely not worth the visit
5
Great place for steak and meat. Also great value for money and nice atmosphere, feels like being in Paris.
4
Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious, but the extra tender beef fillet streaks are the best I've had in Singapore. Beautifully butchered, perfectly cooked and so, so tender. When you just want a great steak, you can't beat it.
4
Ran out of ribeye at lunchtime which was abit of a letdown. But the alternative prime ribs for 2 was great as well.
4
The food is good! Steak is a must try here. Serving is huge and there is free flow fries. Staff are friendly. Cozy place to visit.
5
Great good..Great ambience...Great Service..Value for money....Server was attentive and service exceed expectations!
3
Portions of food is decent. Nice sit out, good service and food is ok. The beef seems better than the their special (vegetable soup, lamb skewer and sausage). I didn't like the cold hard bread either.
5
As we were on here for a short break and because there is so much variety of places to eat and food to try we did not decide until quite late that we would like a steak. Les Bouchons was recommended by a neighbouring Italian Restaurant and we arrived. In spite of the fact that we had not made a reservation we were made welcome and we got exactly the location we wanted I.e. Good view of what was going on outside. We chose steak as planned and medium rare and it was perfect. Attentive service and a great atmosphere
5
This restaurant remains on the high recommendation list for years. Very straight forward, good service and good food. You really need to make reservations as the restaurant is small. They could help saving on the energy bill to turn the aircon a few notches down, but you can eat outside. This restaurant belongs to traditional french restaurants, so you see a variety of typical starters like the Escargo's. The good thing here is that they have good grilled steak of various sizes of cuts. When you have the larger cut, be assured that it is very very comfotable in size (please request for the "doggy-bag". You may have a problem with the size of the portion due to the fact that their lovely fries are served "a go-go

Steak lovers: Drop everything and go. Order every sauce they have for your frites and pour the leftovers on your filet. We treat ourselves to Les Bouchons a couple times a year, but the truth is--it's excellent value for the money and quite possibly the best meal in Singapore. We should go more often. For $30 corkage you can bring your own vino. This is a meal you'll want to arrive at with an empty stomach and then linger over long into the evening. There are two locations, but the ambience of the Ann Siang Rd outlet is by far our favorite: intimate, cozy, yet not pretentious.

Our hotel concierge recommended Les Bouchons as a neighborhood gem. It's tiny. 5 tables of 4 and 2 for 2 inside, and a few outside. You need to book. Good service. Prompt food delivery. Well cooked steak. We overheard the three English guys at a nearby table saying they ordered medium so they were served medium rare, but our medium rare was cooked perfectly (11 year old agreed) though perhaps less cooked than liked for some people. The fries were excellent. The salad pleasant. The steak was HUGE. We each had the ribeye and could eat less than half. I'm guessing it was around 400-500g. Either starve yourself beforehand or share. We enjoyed the dinner. Would return. Area around the restaurant was very cool, old Singapore.

Free flow of bread and fries. Wonderful and tasteful steak with herb butter and red wine sauce. The steak is tender and cook to the correct doneness. A small restaurant which is suitable for couple and team dinner. Nice and cosy environment. Excellent service.

Small restaurant in trendy Club Street. Very nice steak and frites and at a reasonable price. Efficient service and not obtrusive.

We went here back in May for my son's 30th birthday, he wanted to go there as he said they served the best steak in Singapore. On arrival the staff seemed very disinterested and I felt it was an effort for them to seat us and take drinks orders. We ordered 3 of the starters including the bone marrow to share between four and then 4 steaks with apparently free flow french fries. My steak was of poor quality and why anybody would want free flow french fries when they tasted of old cooking oil and were limp I really don't know. Both the food and drinks including the wine are very overpriced and the service dismal. Such a shame when it was a special occasion. With the bill coming in at $576 SD for the four of us I feel we could have spent the money far better elsewhere. This restaurant used to be highly rated but I can see why it has slipped down the listings

Good meal steak and chips very tasty and good value for money Service was not good We sat outside and were left unattended once the food was served It seamed liked there was 1 waitress serving he entire restaurant which is absurd Would go back for the steak

Went for a steak frites with my husband at lunchtime. We thought it a bit pricey and were therefore expecting high quality meat (and frites). My husband's ribeye was good but not cooked the way he had ordered it. My sirloin was tender but bland, totally devoid of taste. The frites were very oily and dark (suspect overused oil). On the positive side, the side salad was excellent as was the glass of red wine (by the glass). Service was as bland as my steak. Definitely not worth the price

Turned up on a Thursday night without a reservation and managed to get an outside table. The main focus of Les Bouchons are steaks and they offer a fair range. My sirloin came with the accompanying sides of fries, salad and an assortment of sauces and mustards. The medium-rare steak was cooked to perfection, well rested and seasoned. The accompanying fries and salad were ok, but not worth getting excited at the 'endless supply' of. A good selection of wines available by the glass, carafe and bottle

Les Bouchons is one of a few restaurants which serves cote de boeuf so we dropped in one week night for dinner. Upon arrival at the restaurant in the Club Street area, we found all the tables in the very small dining room to be either occupied or reserved. The only tables available were outside placed along the five-foot way. Rather than go elsewhere, we settled for an outside table which of course does not accord any privacy as there was a steady stream of people walking by. And since the tables are placed outside, the table next to us was soon occupied by a smoking couple. I would not wish to sit outside in future.For starters, we ordered Assiette de Charcuterie at $18.00. This was a decent plate of assorted cold cuts. Our main course of cote de bouef (1 kg for 2) at $48 per person was served on a wooden board with an assortment of condiments: dijon mustard, bearnaise sauce and horse radish. The staff also brought big bowls of salad and french fries to help ourselves. The meat was cooked just right, medium rare, and was succulent and flavourful. However it did not come with any bone marrow unlike some restaurants in France. Nor did the staff know what breed of cattle it was from other than to say it was from Australia. No big deal but we just like to know the breed of cattle for such an expensive cut of meat.Wine was affordable at under $50 for carafe and $12.50 per glass. We had a nice bordeaux which went well with the beef. In total, our dinner cost under $210 including the usual 10% service charge and 7% tax. Service was fine with one manager and one wait staff in attendance. For our next visit to Les Bouchons, we will be sure to make a dinner reservation for an inside table

Came as 2 couples.Booked outside table as this was all there was.Was not told there would be. Monstrous house party in the street.Food was OK - steaks were good without being special - giant prawn was good - chips are nice.Waiters tries to open wine bottle with a screw cap by using corkscrew - they weren't that good or fast.Bill was huge Nd included monstrous tip for fairly ordinary service.Buyer beware
3
The complimentary bread is hard & cold. It would have been much much better if they heat up the bread. The escargots are great but I personally prefer those still in their shells.The ribeye is decently good, not great but good by most standard. The lamb on skewer is nice. Those of you who are sensitive to lamb unique taste, there's none of it. Hmmm... I may come by again... Maybe..
3
In a very under crowded place we began by being treated to non stop foul mouthed ranting by some Australian gobs with an extremely limited vocabulary.The young Singaporean lady customer was visibly distressed.Our salad was forgotten and at2pm we were refused any more service.This place used to be popular.I would suggest you avoid it like the plague these days
4
I regularly go to Les Bouchons (I prefer Rive Gauche for the location, but food is equally good at both). Great and reliably good steak frites as a good price for Singapore - recommended.
2
The steak was not char grilled, but wet. Fries were good though. So quite surprised to always see it pop up in top ten list of steak houses.
4
Had entree & main here... The serves are so generous no entree is needed! Reasonably priced and good quality - will definitely be back!

If you spend enough time in SE Asia you will realise that the general quality of beef here can be lacking unless you pay a decent amount of currency for it (as the meat will have been imported). Secondly, its not uncommon for chefs/cooks to plainly screw up a good cut of steak by either over-seasoning or overcooking.Thus it was great to have made it to Les Bouchons for lunch. The Cote de Boeuf was cooked to medium rare perfection as requested. Sliced nicely for sharing. Tender and full of flavour.Only criticism is that the beer selection is.... well not much of a selection at all. They only have Heineken. Straight to the wines
4
Part of chain owned by 2 French guys in Chinatown. Always very good quality steak and probably no where better in Singapore for Steak / Salad and Chips. Quite small and almost always booked for lunch and dinner so suggest you book a day or so in advance

This is an excellent little steakhouse located just off of Club Street on Ann Siang Rd.It's been around forever (in Singaporean restaurant terms) and still provides a great piece of meat or whatever else you may want, salmon, lamb and etc.The price for a ribeye or a sirloin with a salad and all the fries you can kill yourself with will run you about 40 bucks Singaporean. It's a small place with some outside seating. It's quaint and in the past you normally couldn't get in. Tonight however we just walked in and got a table for two. However, don't try it. Call days in advance for a reservation just to be sure you have a place.I love it. The place is consistent and the service is fine.If you sit outside you can smoke and watch all the action. People going and coming all night. Good people watching. Nice part of Singapore
4
We have been eating here when visiting Singapore over the past 8 years. The place never disappoints. Stick with the steak and frites. Wine is inexpensive (for Singapore!!). Service is professional. This may not be Relais de Venus but it is certainly a great place for a simple meal of steak and fries. The place fills up so make a bookin
4
Fantastic evening out. We were very well looked after by Claude, the manager on Sat night. Between the 4 of us we had 2 starters, 4 steaks, bottle of bubbly and a bottle of red... $500. Probably a little on the pricey side, but the food and service were top notch
4
Using a well tried formal of Steak and Frites, this restaurant in the heart of the CBS is a perfect place for an informal lunch or Dinner.Haute Cuisine it is not, but the simple french menu, with little french decor touches transports you to A small arrondissement in Paris - which I guess is the point.Fun and a change form endless Noodles or local dishesService however was poor (local singaporean who could barely speak English, let alone understand a french menu!
4
It is tough to get reservations at this place! I gotta make reservations a few days ahead and i am kinda the last minute kind. haha...For value the steak is great! Usual order is rib-eye and it comes with a nice salad. When craving for steak on a casual friday night, this is one of my favourite hunts in town
4
Get the dover sole with lemon and butter - blew me out the water - wow - They also have daily specials that will literally blow you out the water.
5
Steak are tasty. When you ordered medium rare it really come with medium rare. The house red are perfectly matching with the steak. Frite and salads expectedly well prepared considered unlimited supply
3
Steak and Chips are good quality however not worth the price. Nice view, ambiance and service good.
Others better in the area.
5
This is a classic French Bistro where they serve steak frites in several types of portions. You get, all you can eat frites, BTW so come hungry. It has a descent wine list - and for those who prefer non-beef items, there are other choices that are descent as well.
5
There are two of these, One near Club Street and the other at Robertson Walk. I tried both. Both are good but on balance I would lean towards Club Street, The Steaks are simple but very well done (no pun intended). The wine lists are extensive and reasonably priced
4
This place is a great little quiet restaurant which is good for a catch up or a business lunch.Usually this place is all about a bottle of red and the 1kg Cote de bouef which is actually pretty good value, especially for the area.One thing you must do is book in advance, as otherwise you'll struggle to get a table
4
Singapore is nice for its outdoor places, Les Bouchons has a small yet cosy terrace to start withOrdered the charcuterie platter, okay...But then the entrecote with home made fries, hmmm delicious1/ They know what "rare" means it terms of cooking2/ home made fries, sooo good, like my mom's ;)3/ very good wine listThe bill is not cheap for sure (around sgd130 per head for 3 courses and wine) but you are "happy" to pay for i

Three of us had lunch here today and unfortunately the meal was not up to Les Bouchons normal standards. We all had the sirloin steak but the quality of the meat was not good, pretty tasteless and very tough and sinewy, to make matters worse our host ordered his medium to well done but it arrived medium rare just like the other two. Add to that frites which were so over cooked they were close to burnt (and we weren't even asked if we would like any more!) and an accompanying salad which was limp with a few remnants of nuts at the bottom of the bowl and I'm afraid this was a most unsatisfactory experience. Sad, because we eat here regularly and in the past the food has been exemplary. We hope it returns to form again soon
4
This is by far the better location for Les Bouchons, the atmosphere is nice, small, not too brightly lit and the service is attentive and personal. Why can't ehy just transfer this to their Robertson Quay location?A good steak with a free flow of fries, a good bottle of Pomerol for a truly acceptable price, what more can you expect? And this all at a price level that makes the Cut's, Mortons and Wooloomooloo look like overpriced and overrated venues (have been to all, love them and yes, their steak may be even better, but at what price?)

Made reservations at 7pm and when we arrived 20mins early, we were denied entry as they opened at 7pm. We hopped over to the nearby Tong Heng to grab some egg tarts and had a dessert to pass time. We were the first to arrive at 7pm but the place was quickly filled up by 8pm. It is a small restaurant that can perhaps sit maybe 18-20 people inside plus another 2-3 tables for al fresco dining. Crowd was consists mainly of expats. Reservations is recommended to avoid disappointment. The menu is rather limited but it was ok for us. We ordered escargots with garlic butter for starters. It was not bad but our standard were high as we had the experience of best escargots at a cosy restaurant at Montmartre in Paris. I ordered the extra tender beef filiet and hubby the ribeye. It's a simple fare, steak served with yummy homemade fries (which are by the way free flow) and was served with garden salad topped with chopped walnuts. The salad dressing was not to our liking and the bread were hard. There are 4 selections of sauces (mayo, mustard, dijon mustard, bÃ©arnaise sauce) and horseradish for your steak and yes like many singaporean, we asked for chilli sauce too. We both like the extra tender beef filet better and yes, we will return again for just steak and fries. Nearest MRT : Tanjong Pagar Station and another 10 mins walk. Near to Maxwell market that serves many yummy hawker food

Steak-Frites is great, but make sure you order the rib-eye!
Their Sirloin isnt top-notch. Outside seating near the river is great. Reservations recommended.
4
Walked in casually and got the last table on the terrace; no big deal.
Order was taken swiftly and my steak was excellent.
All the staff were friendly and I will go back anytime.
5
Les Bouchons serves excellent steaks and their prices are not sky-high. Having visited both the robertson quay and ann siang hill restaurants, I prefer the small and tiny one at ann siang. Weird? It's because it's somewhat typical of Paris restaurants, small and therefore cosy. Steak frites is the number 1 seller here and you can ask for more fries if it isn't enough! There's also a tray of sauces for your choice

I ate dinner here last night. I was reluctant to try this place as there are some negative reviews around. My take is quite different. I was looking for a tender steak, decent fries and a bottle of wine on the river for my Birthday. These guys delivered well! The menu is simple with few options, the outdoor setting quiet, unlike Clarke Quay. If you looking for simple quality go try Les Bouchons
5
This place has everything we like: quality food, good wine, quality service and cozy stylish atmosphere. We like that the place is tiny, just 7 tables or so. The menu is short, but great. Itmis a steak house French restaurant and the steaks are melting in your mouth. They serve home made french fries that come as manyntimes you need them! The wine list is good, and the house wine is not that expensive and fits very well with offered food. The service is friendly and good. A great restaurant to enjoy while eating

If you are after a good solid meal with high quality then this is a great place for you to go to. The atmosphere was nice and relaxed with a light French theme. The food works out to be good value with large portions of meat and thin cut chips which I am a fan of. For wine I can really recommend the house red which was good value and very drinkable. It seems to be popular as a location so I would also recommend booking ahead to get a table at the time you want. You can then finish off your evening on club street where there are some fun bars to visit

I went there with a group of 6 but the food wasn't good at all. I ordered rib eye, my husband and one of the girl took Salmon and 3 others took meat. I don't know what happened that day as normally when i come there i've always been satisfied, great meat, nice home made french fries and salad. Salad lot of bitter part of the vegie, french fries was too burn/cooked and the best think was our meat and salmon didn't come out well, all too cooked!! A bit disappointed for the last visit but i'll always comeback!! Small restaurant near by the river and good place to catch up with friends
4
This place is just right for my taste, I love the french touch on the food and settings.The food quality is the best, wine selection, and service but you just have to book few days in advance to get a table because if you just walk in is posible.I would say try it in order to see what it likes.... Excellent

We had dinner at Les Bouchons on Saturday night at 7pm. The restaurant opens at 7pm on Saturday's so do not get there early.The restaurant is quite small and does not have a lot of seating capacity so you have to reserve in advance. We were only able to get outdoor seating because we only reserved on Thursday. There were numerous people who came to the restaurant without a reservation while we were there and they were turned away.The food at Les Bouchons is excellent. The bread is crispy on the outside and warm and fluffy on the inside. I had the Ribeye steak and it is simply the best steak I have had so far in Singapore. My wife had the salmon and it was also excellent. Surprisingly the French Fries were the best I have ever had and they are free flowing - you just have to ask for more!!!!When you are seated outside the service is not the best but it is acceptable as the waiter will come out from time to time to check on you. They are not proactive so you have to ask for everything but they are more than happy to provide it to you when you do ask.We will definitely go back but if you are an American or British person looking for a good steak and chips then Les Bouchons is the best place we have found!!!

I recommend starting your meal here with the escargot. The escargot was amazing and was one of the best I have had in a very long time. Also, the steaks here is good and the fries are never ending. This is a reasonably priced meal for Singapore that is near some good bar
5
If you want to eat a real French meal, this is the restaurant you have to go.
The food is excellent and prices are good too.
Service is as excellent and people working there are so friendly but stay professional.
4
We had the specialty dish: cote de beaof, which is a 1 kg beef rib steak. It was delicious, but i'd say the serving is enough to feed 4. Love the french fries too. Overall, it was a very nice meal
4
those french fries!
3
Simple but effective comfort food!
4
simple but good
5
steak frite. its a simple, relatively no frills meal. and therein lies its brilliance. the robertson one is bigger but both have their merits in ambience i think.
4
Love the UUS steak and free flow of fries (flee flow of flies)
4
US Grain Fed Ribeye with free flow fries at a great price! What more can one ask for?
3
I went there for dinner last Monday total 7 persons.The appetizer,my salmon was good and for the other they said it just fine.But the main dish my friends ordered steaks and they said it was bad cut of meat.My lamb was the same.It was very hard to chew and not much flavour on it.The wines choices is great and the service is o.k. So,I will go back for drink not for food :
4
The restaurant's quite small and can only seat probably less than 50 people. Due to the resto's size, I can barely hear my friends talk because conversations from other diners reverberate! However, despite their miniscule size, the serving is HUGE! We started with an order of escargot which was delicious. I enjoyed the rib-eye steak I ordered even if it was a bit on the lean side. I was hoping for more (sinful) fat but the taste was just right. The meat came with a serving of side salad and, here's the best part, free flowing french fries! Yum
