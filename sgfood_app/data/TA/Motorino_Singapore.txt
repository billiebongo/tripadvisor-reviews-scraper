Ordered meatball pizza: meatball was mushy, pizza was flat.
Ordered aglio olio pasta which is a can't go wrong- v average, like the sort u would get at a fast food.
So very overpriced
4
not in big portion but taste is ok,
average pricing..
good choices of pizza
drinks and alcohol price during happy hour- not the cheapest though

A ridiculously small plate of over cooked pasta for 40$, I thought they where joking with me when they brought the food.
Afterwards they just trying to get rid of you.

One of the best restaurant that you can find in Singapore. The pizza is fantastic! I strongly suggest to come here!

Avoid this place, flavourless looking pizzas on menu, we stayed only for a drink, $20 for Long Island tea with no spirits in it, only coke. Go to Verve round the corner, much better place

No stars for this thoroughly unpleasant place and it‚Äôs incompetent or dishonest staff. Never been treated in such a shoddy manner. Attended with my wife at the end of an amazing holiday, and I ordered pizza and my wife ordered pasta. However, the pasta arrived and I was sat there waiting for my pizza. No sign, and now wife‚Äôs food is getting cold. She went in, with her food, asking if it can be served at the same time as mine. She was told no it could not, and my pizza was still in the oven! She complained that her food was now not hot enough and would be cold by the time mine was served. No joy, she was told that‚Äôs the way it is. Not only that, she was told that it was her fault as she had not specified that we wished to eat together, at the same time! We were sat together ordering together for Lords sake! We cancelled our order as her food was now tepid at best and I had not been served. Of course, we wished to pay for the wine we consumedWe were told that this could not be done. We were told that food orders could not be cancelled. The waitress who had served us then ran into the restaurant and served my pizza despite being told by me that I no longer wanted it. I asked for the manager but only got someone who described himself as senior staff who refused to cancel our order and said ‚Äúthis is how things are done in Singapore‚Äù, which is not my experience. We refused to pay, they refused to cancel. They threatened to take our photo, we almost exploded. Security was called, who at least had some desire to solve the problem, until he threatened to call the police if the bill wasn‚Äôt paid. In a strange jurisdiction, I decided to pay but only after the ‚Äúsenior member of staff‚Äù took my wife‚Äôs dish off the bill (something he insisted could not be done!). This matter is now the subject of a formal complaint. I have travelled the world and eaten at some of the best, and lowliest, and never been treated in such a manner. Avoid. Avoid at all cost

Delicious thin crust Napoli pizza is rest you are going to get here. Great choices of topping. I recommend the Quattro Formaggi - four cheeses. The meatball was fantastic as well and carbonara. They have pasta as well but the pizza is what we have every time. Great service and very prompt. Well priced as well

It was good to have a table outside and be able enjoy a cool evening early, before the rush and the noisy time.The service was good, provided by a smiling young lady.We had a pizza that was tasty, but i must say although the dough was thin, soft and goodwhich is a dough with a half millimeter layer of tomato sauce and 5 slices of saussage! Expensive for it was really

We were looking for a place to get a quick bite and came across this place. It's a small little Italian joint. We ordered four single serving pizzas. They were very good and were served relatively quickly. Can't comment on the pastas. The best pizza was the picante "spicy" pizza! Highly recommend. Prices are reasonable for Singapore. Ask for olive oil and parmesan cheese on the side for the kick. Would come back.
4
Sorry, there must be many better places than this! A green salad, comprising of some leaves with 2 small cherry tomatoes and some dressing at Sin$9 is poor value. A very average pasta dish and a pizza with little topping followed. Two beers and two orange juice, total bill over $100!! I know Singapore is expensive but this place must be near the top when talking about value! They even had to be reminded to adjust the bill to allow for the drinks promotion
2
Okay pizza dough but very little toppings, like eating only bread. Won¬¥t visit again there are much better pizza places in Singapore.
4
The service was fast and the waiters were nice. The food was also very good, however, the taxes were too high! Also, there's very limited and basic options for vegetarians (which is sad).
4
Italian restaurant when you have had enough of the other menus. Wood fired pizza oven delivering super quick and delicious pizza. Drinks at reasonable rates. Pizza and drinks for two for under 80 dollars.
4
Two visits to this restaurant. Had pizzas and pasta and all were very tasty. Staff very attentive and friendly. Quick service and all fresh.
4
Although from New York, it does serve very good and authentic Italian pizzas.
The margherita, meatball and spicy chicken were all delicious.
They could do with more mozzarella which should be bubbling when served. This did not happen.
Surprising find in Clarke Quay.
5
The MOST authentic Napoletana pizza I have ever had in my life. We had to order a second. Great, friendly staff! Definitely would recommend it
1
After walking around Clarke Quay we stumbled upon this apparently Michelin Star awarded Italian Restaurant and assumed we would enjoy a meal here. How wrong we were. To start, after ordering Bruschetta we were served some fatty prosciutto with stale breadsticks. My wife ordered a pasta dish for her main meal and asked for parmesan cheese to which they obliged. However the amount given was minescule. It was served in a shot glass and was approximately 1/4 full. When we asked for more our request was denied.I ordered a pizza, and although delicious, the damage was already done.This was the worst restaurant we ate at in Singapore
3
The pizza's are great - real nice Neapolitan style.However the staff is over pushy and does not leave one to have an intimate discussion without constantly asking one to order.Had to ask the staff not to return until we called them.If the service can be improved, Motorino will be the perfect hang out. The food is great

This restaurant is located amongst many Asian restaurants and bars but is still authentic Italian food. The menu consisting of mainly pizza and pasta which would be seen at any other Italian restaurant around the world. The restaurant mainly caters for outdoor seating which is great as the surrounding street has a good atmosphere at dinner time even though it was Monday night and not the weekend. Luckily for us they had a table for 9 even though we didn't make a reservation. Generally speaking everyone in our party enjoys Italian cuisine so there was something for everyone on the menu. As great as my pasta dish was the portion was on the small side and it did cost 24 singapore dollars. Apart from the price factor all the food was delicious which is the main thing when at a restaurant. The service was also good throughout the evening although there weren't many other customers to serve. The food didn't take to long to come either. Although we didn't have dessert I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you are looking for Italian food in Singapore

Despite having an amazing pizza oven, they don't know how to make arguably the most famous pizza of them all, margherita with the buffalo mozzarella.They chopped all the mozzarella up into tiny pieces instead of slicing beautiful discs. When I told them this was incorrect, I was informed that I was wrong even after I pointed out the photos of amazing traditional margherita pizza on the columns outside the restaurant. By the way, read those posters properly and you see that the "best pizza in town" and Michelin recommended is for the restaurant in New York. Very misleading to say the least.What a crying shame as the pizza base is one of the best. If they knew how to top the pizza correctly and had suitable ham to offer the prosciutto fungi pizza, they could actually be best in town
3
Pizza was okay. The service staff were polite and attentive. All was nice only the alcohol was expensive in my very the humble opinion. üéÉit's good to have a taste of their pizza using the brickstove and that's all
3
As I quickly found out...Singapore is expensive with a 1L jug of local beer costing $35Sg
The pizza here was really good, but so, so expensive for a quick dinner in a not very fancy surround...!!!
Customer Service virtually non-existent sadly....!!!
4
We had a really good stone oven baked pizza and pasta here. The portions were a decent size and decently priced.
3
We enjoyed our pizza's at Motorino, they were good but not great, as there were not a lot of toppings, however the crust and sauce were very tasty . The service was quick and attentive.
5
Lovely meatballs in tomato sauce. The brussel sprout pizza, margherita pizza are two of the best I have tasted, bite on sea salt flakes, so good.
Good service.
3
The restaurant is located in the heart of clarke quay. Ideal to have a drink after dinner! The food and menu is quite standard, not fancy but good. Pizza are cooked in a traditionnal wood fire oven. The service is not perfect as the staff was not anticipating the needs of customers and they made a mistake when the bill came. But overally a pleasant moment at Motorino
2
We have always love the pizza at Motorino in Clarke Quay Singapore and we always dine there at least once whenever we are in Singapore. I always recommend Motorino Pizza to my friends and even wrote a glowing review on Trip Advisor last year.We were there again last month and we were so disappointed. My husband ordered his usual - pizza with parma ham and rucola. The dough was still delicious but there were very little toppings and cheese on the pizza. However, we decided to give Motorino a 2nd chance and went back again a week later. The pizza was still having very miserable toppings and that is when we decided that we will not be back again for pizza there! It is definitely not worth paying S$27 for the pizza

10 person group lobbed around 8pm after not being able to be accommodated anywhere else in CQ. Staff were excellent. Orders for food and drinks were flying left, right and centre and they were delivered exactly as ordered without a thing being written down. Pastas were incredibly fresh and VERY tasty. Pizzas were generous in size and very yummy. Wines were limited - but what they had was affordable and surprisingly good. Great place and would definitely go back.

Ready for a nice Saturday lunch with the inlaws, and were sorely disapointed.The Caprese was laughable, only 3 little pieces of store-bought mozzarella and small tomatoes... Not impressed.The pizzas couldn't be smaller and they could not be stingier with the ingredients. The Meatball pizza came with 5 tiny pieces of some sort of meat concoction at $23!!!Horrible place... and the manager? Nowhere to be found on a Saturday afternoon... and it shows! Spend your $$$ somewhere else! We left hungry, thankfully only ordered 2 pizzas, a beer and the caprese (Sitll $100).What a waste of

After had a great value lunch at Raffles Center, we went for a walk around our hotel, in the Clarke Quay neigborhood, all the restaurants were full so we decided to have a pasta at Motorino. A simple plate - spaghetti with basil extravirgin oil olive with pork meatballs. Despite the italian name and themed, the restaurant is run by chinese. The staff is rude and the foos was terrible for the price. Almost 60sgd for this crap dinner! Skip this one
3
Very forgettable average food with prices that promise more. We both had a different type of spaghetti. The food was well prepared and service was decent. The portions were small for two fit westerners. It's just a bland and boring experience.
4
Good pizzas. Good service. Decent ambience. Nice pizza oven. Shouldn't charge for water though. Try the carbonara pizza.
2
Went to try their set-lunch Comodoro Spaghetti and Margherita pizza both are tasteless even I added bacon for topping.
Service is very good.
3
Nice service and location. But the pizza was a bit burned at the edges and bottom what took the taste away from the nice topping.
4
We eat pizza with soppressata, it was good, but not amazing. Price is almost right related to Singapore. The service was very good. I advise it!
5
Top notch traditional Neapolitan pizza joint in Clarke Quay, we stopped by for lunch on Sunday, it was quiet, and the pizza was awesome.
3
The pizzas were good. We had the quattro formagi. However the spagetti was very average. On a Saturday night and so place crowded.
3
Ordered Sopressata Piccante as it's my favourite menu in Motorino Wan Chai Hong Kong, so I expected it would be "the same".Well, it tastes kinda OK, but it doesn't taste as good as the one in HK, it's not tasty and a bit hard to bite.. More disappointed cause I "kind promised" my family on to the best pizza resto. We ended up in Lau Pa Sat again before going home!To be fair, the service was good, and it was quiet fast as well to get our pizza
4
Dined here with my family on a weeknight for dinner. The restaurant was pretty empty as it was way past eight. Ordered four cheese pizza, grilled chicken wings, a Mocktail, tiramisu and chocolate ice cream. The chicken wings came with citrus dressing which complemented the dish very well. The four cheese pizza was good. I was not pleased with the crust though as it was fluffy while I'm a fan of thin crusts. The tiramisu was good and the serving was generous. It is undeniable that it is pricey but being a local, I'm fine with it as I'm paying a sum for the location of the restaurant. Overall, it is a good pizzeria in Clarke Quay.
2
Why would I want to give up all the great ingredients that classic American pizzas offer for this? Motorino's lightly proofed and doughy crust was sort of interesting, but I'd rather have a buttery Sicilian-style crust or a thin New York slice any day. Motorino's pizza sauce was a disappointment; I can name several US chains and neighborhood joints whose sauces I like much better. The cheese on Motorino's pie lacked body; I want to sink my teeth into chewy, gooey mozzarella. And the toppings we received at Motorino were sparse and uninteresting compared to the options at most US pizza places. Motorino also serves pasta. For some unknown reason, the meat sauce they add to their spaghetti is spicy instead of herbed and sweet. I may be a Philistine with unrefined tastes, but, as a former pizza chef, I know what I like in pizza and pasta, and this ain't it
2
I will not be very original compared to previous opinion, but this restaurant is overpriced for the service and quality of products offered.
Drinks and pizzas are not exeptional.
1
Even if the service is quite nice, I will never come back to this restaurant. The price is crazy for a melted pizza with no taste. 12$ for a glass of beer! Come on...
4
The pasta was amazing the pizza was good. A good Italian joint in Clark quay, the lunch promotion is very interesting!
4
This pizza was great and I'll definitely be back. I'm pretty fussy when it comes to pizza, and I wasn't disappointed here.
4
Great italian Restaurant with authentic Napoli Food, best Pizza in town. Try the "neapolitan style, soft, elastic, tender, fleshy, fragrant Pizza baked in Wood fire" as the promote it!
4
When we visited Motorino we ordered two pizzas and a bottle of water and we paid SGD66. Even though the pizzas were very good and tasty we believe the price was very high. However all nearby restaurants on Clarke Quay charge similar prices.
4
These place in right night club n tourist place Clarke quay. In these area all restaurants n bar are with loud music n full of people n groups.
3
As we walked in the waitress asked if any of us was ordering pizza as there were only three doughs left. Not a good start for a pizzeria. This place was expensive. One clam pizza , with very few clams, one Caesar salad, one coke and two small beers. That's not cheap. The pizza was good though. Too much competition and variety to entice me to return . Menu price does not include 10% service charge and 7% gst.
4
We were hanging out for a good Italian feed and we were generally very well fed here. The pizzas were authentic and the bolognaise sauce on pasta was great. 2 adults and 2 children set up back roughly $100 AUD with a couple of beers and a glass of wine included so reasonable value for Singapore
2
Ordered through a third party delivery service. What a joke, $12 dollars for a mixed green salad that comprised dry leaves, and roasted corn for $12 that when put together was not even one single head of corn. Pizza dough was soggy and not cooked through. Dont waste your time, the prices are comparable to Pizzeria Mozza in Marina Bay Sands, for incredible delicious pizzas
4
So the Pizza's are different , but not exotic . Overall definitely worth a try , but be prepared to shell out about 50 dollars per person. the pastas were also nice and sowere the chicken wings.
5
Fantastic Pizza and Pasta. Pizzas only take 90 seconds to cook in the wood fired oven.
Service was attentive and very friendly .Although not on the river, this place was a great find in the back streets in the arcade at Clarke Quay.
5
Great location in a busy at night part of Singapore.
Friendly smiley service n fast too
Worth it :)
Pepperoni pizza is a killer too
5
We highly recommend this place for authentic and delicious pizza. Service & everything else is ok as well - but the pizza is the bomb
2
Using Mozza Pizzeria as a benchmark with respect to pricing, Motorino has to improve their pizza offering as it was nothing spectacular.
4
We went to Clark Quay with some friends to have dinner and one of them suggested Motorino to have a very nice pizza. Was really a good choice. the pizza was made in Napoli's style: thin on the center high on the border. the ingredients were fresh and the service really fast; They serve some Italian beers and the personnel is cool.Little bit expensive for a pizza but in Singapore and specially in Clark Quay it's quite normal
3
I had dinner at motorino after hearing how good it was from another colleague who ate here. The entrees we shared we bland the fior di latte with basil and tomatoe needed seasoning,as did the chicken wings.Our pizza,s looked like the ones in Italy but again lacking taste. The ticker outer edges were not cooked through and extremely doughy.The are not much toppings on and any additional toppings are all extra cost.I don't feel it was worth the price & wouldn't go bac
5
Went to this lovely restaurant at Clarke Quay and enjoyed the beatiful fresh food. We had the mozzarella, tomato and basil to start and then the four cheese pizza which was fresh with hand made base and lovely ingredients. Excellent meal in nice surroundings. Attentive service but not intrusive. Would recommend you give this a try
1
Visited this restaurant at trendy Clarke Quay a week or so ago. Ordered a top of the range pizza plus a salad. Maybe the wood fired oven was malfunctioning or the wood was wet but pizza was doughy and the base not cooked through. Topping consisted of onions and anchovies ( which I had ordered) but not much else. Salad was a bit of tired lettuce or spinach-no tomato. All in all probably the worst pizza I ever had. To cap it all off a 10% service charge was added as well as the 7% vat. Staff were pleasant enough.One beer, one pizza and a limp salad-$SGD 61. Not to be repeated
5
This is our 3rd visit to Motorino. It was love in first taste for my husband and daughter when we first dined there 6 months ago during our Christmas holiday. We had the parma ham with rocket, margherita pizza and caesar salad. Everything was delicious and amazing, the margherita pizza tastes better than any we had so far, even compared with the restaurants in Italy! The crust has a really good texture and taste.On this 3rd visit, we dined with a bigger group and besides pizza we had also spaghetti carbonara and linguini vongole. Both pasta dishes were delicious too.Motorino is the favourite pizza place place for my family, and definitely a must go restaurant whenever we visit Singapore
4
The pizza is the real Napoletana, with a soft and slightly thick dough, the taste is amazing, I had a Cesar salad before which was also very good, the service fast and the waiters nice, I will come back!
5
Loved the pizza and the prices were decent... pizzas were a good size and the flavor of the crust, sauce, and toppings were excellent. Would definitely recommend.
4
I've seen this place several times and finally decided to eat here. I was not disappointed, good Pizza and friendly staff, prices are ok as well.
Will definitely go back!
5
Not easy to find a good real tasty pizza. This one was excellent.
I m reading some of the negative reviews and I m surprised. As an Italian I did enjoy it and I will go back.
4
Pizza was nice, Parma ham and roquette salad, service excellent and smiling
Not so busy lunch time
Way busier diner time
5
I was made to feel at ease, and enjoyed my meal here. Thank you for your relaxed and helpful welcome. A short stay in Singapore was a delight! Thank you again. Special thank you to Natasha.

We had diner at Motorino early May. The service as very friendly and attentive. We had some different Italian dishes, which all were prepared very well and very much Italian style. The pizza with rocket salad and ham was perfect and couldn't be better in Italy, thin and crispy.Of course, like everywhere in Singapore, alcoholic beverages are not cheap but Motorino is not overdoing even as Clarke Quay is a very touristic place with upmarket price level.So, I can recommend the place if you don't want to sit directly at the waterfront and if you would like to enjoy anything else than Indonesian or Malaysian food
5
Found by chance as we wandered around the area. My wife noticed the wood fired pizza oven first - we had to try it. I have to say we were not disappointed. Late afternoon, so very quiet but the service was first class and the pizza was as authentic and tasty as anything I've ever had in Italy.Would absolutely recommend!!
3
Went here on a Tuesday night on a whim. My wife, and I and her parents. Walked by - saw the oven - which looked like serious business and went in. Nice and courteous staff throughout our visit. Had one pre course in total - buffalo mozzarella with tomato and olive oil. This came straight from the fridge where it had been made ready earlier. Not much flavour, slightly chewy, and every bite cold in the mouth. Four pizzas - two Margarita's - and two cremini mushroom & sausage, one with a bacon added on. The pizzas were all cooked alright. The base was not what I perceive as Italian. More like a mix of American and Italian. Not as thin as original Italian, and slightly more doughy . With the place originating from the states (learned that later) that's understandable - but when you expect (maybe wrongly?) Italian - still a bit of a letdown. The Margaritas fine in flavour, but the mushroom & sausage underwhelming. All they tasted of was garlic. The sausage came in the part of sausage meat, kinda extracted from the sausage, and loosely covered onto the pizza. The mushrooms were thinly sliced but fine. The bacon, tasted more like ham than smoked bacon and was drowned out by the garlic. There was no tomato base on this pizza which caught me out. I had to double check whether it had been forgotten. It hadn't. It was missing in my opinion. With one bottle of Chardonnay, and one small San Pellegrino this all came to SGD$ 230.-. That's ca. GBP 116.- which is poor value for money. Pizzas simply to mediocre for that price
1
We picked this restaurant for the last night of our holiday. Starters were ok but the pizza here is dreadful. The cheese is totally tasteless, the base is burnt. Meatballs....I'm not sure they are even meat! Would not recommend to anyone who enjoys a good pizza. After complaining and not eating our meal we had a waitress who argued with us and told us we had to pay the bill. We left hungry and having paid to not eat. Dreadful.
2
Made the mistake of visiting without checking the menu. Restaurant had very few veg options including pizzas. Don't think, we will visit again.
2
Some of my friends would say: "why order a pizza in Singapore with all its food courts?" The simple answer is that i like to eat pizza :)Staff was nice and friendly in Motorino, however, the pizza was burned in some places, which happens everywhere around the globe, but i happen not to like it because i don't like getting cancer from it (i scraped it off). It was not an issue.The major point for me, is that when you order a quattro formaggi, you expect to taste 4 different kinds of cheese. I only tasted two. I asked again for the menu to compare the ingredients. Then i noticed they did not use mozzarella or parmesan, (the tastes that were missing). Apart from the gorgonzola, there was a big layer of "something" that tasted very neutral. (the kindest word i could cone up with)So do not expect a great quality, i would have given one star, were it not for the great staff.However, if you are a tourist and not a pizza snob, you may actually like it. Good location, to end with something positive

It is not easy to find good traditional Italian pizza in Singapore. We randomly came across Motorino while walking on the Quays and decided to give it a try, attracted by its Brooklyn style. It was a brilliant idea! The thin crust pizzas (including their signature Brussel Sprouts and Smoked Bacon Pizza), fired in a brick oven, were simply delicious with a combination of basil, tomato and DOC mozzarella we never tasted before in Singapore. Besides the pizzas, the menu includes several authentic Italian antipasti, such as prosciutto di parma, roasted mortadella and highly recommended Motorino√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s meatballs. Finally, the efficient and friendly staff, together with a bottle of Gragnano 2013 just made our dinner unforgettable! For all Italians and pizza lovers, this is definitely a must-try!
3
After wondering around Clarke Quay and not deciding where to eat, we stumbled upon Motorino. Location and atmosphere are big benefits, However I felt let down by the pizza. The cheese topping was a bit over the top, leaving the meal feeling heavy. So much potential here for a great eatery
3
I went to this place located in Clark Quay desiring of a yummy pizza . And since this place already describes itself in the Italian cuisine , we thought that the food would actually be worth it . But to our surprise , the veg pizza , we had ordered turned out to be an outrage on our tastebuds . We had ordered a veg pizza along with toppings of onions . The food was very expensive and not worthy at all . There was certainly no issues with the services , but the food was not good at all ! Secondly , this place did not provide us with any Wi-Fi services which was strange as every other outlet at the Clark quay had wifi access for their guests .
4
When we first saw the menu, we were not impressed, brussel sprouts pizza did not appeal to us. We spoke to the waiters and they said they can put any toppings on the pizza. We ordered our pizza with minimal toppings (ham, mushrooms, olives...etc), they were really tasty woodfired pizzas, however each pizza worked out to be around $35 per pizza. The staff were very friendly and helpful
4
It's hard to find good traditional pizza in Singapore. We first came across Motorino in Hong Kong - a friend who lived in New York for years declared it the best she's found in Hong Kong.With that in mind, we were really excited to find out couple of months back that a branch of this Brooklyn pizzeria had opened in Singapore. It didn't disappoint. We've been several times since and our favourites are the marinara, bacon and sprouts and the prosciutto and rocket. The meatballs are good too. We totally agree with the other reviewers who wax lyrical about the crust - it is good! Service is prompt and always with a smile. If you are visiting Clarke Quay, we would definitely recommend Motorino. For everybody else, if you are a pizza fan but not too keen on the Clarke Quay area, this place is worth making the trip for some great authentic food.
4
We love Motorino in NYC and even though we wouldn't ordinarily have pizza in a place like Singapore, we were assured by the staff here that they are closely scrutinised by ten NYC peeps, so we decided to give it a go. And it came pretty close! Good puffy and charred edges, softer in the middle, build your own with an inclusion of white anchovies on the list, which was appreciated. They are quite large, and because we also had the mozzarella and tomato starter and the chicken wings (both excellent) the two pizzas we ordered ended up being too much.We also drank a lovely sparkling red which was a brilliant match for the food.The only downside is its location. I really don't like Clarke Quay, particularly on the weekend, it's full of hard drinking bogan types and has nothing at all to recommend it (Robertson Quay on the other hand, is worth the walk). Go earlier in the week and sit outside and enjoy the night air (and less people).Highly recommended
4
This place is in Clarkes Quay which is teeming with eateries making it difficult to choose, but went at lunch time as the whole place looks totally different at night. All we wanted was a Pizza and a couple of drinks.The worry with us about pizzas is some places give you a Pizza with a thick base or they are frozen.The Pizzas here are freshly baked with a thin base, good topping , crust round the edge a little thick but thats a personal thing and it did not spoil the Pizza which was very good, Nice freindly staff, Pizza from around $22 singapore
4
We were looking for a "non Asian" option after a couple of days in Singapore. Overall the pizza was probably better than OK, drinks were a little expensive and it was a little out of the action - but overall, not a bad stop for a quick dinner..
