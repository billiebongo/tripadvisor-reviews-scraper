Beautiful Ambience vegetarians have just 1 choice to eat nothing more. Quiet a big serve for wedges. Children can play in the beach and in the sands. Very calm & serene spot.

Meat platter was excellent and enough for 2. Watch the sunset with a candlelight dinner.
There was also fireworks from a show going on nearby which was the highlight of our dinner.
Staff was great and food prices was reasonable for the location.

We didn't search enough but it seemed like there are not many restaurants near the beach. So we just tried this bar because they still have meal menu. It was right before sunset, so just perfect time and location to enjoy it. I think this place is good if you don't have any other option

Gives you a beach feel with sand all around, nicely laid back and at night have music too. During day maybe a bit hot but early evening very pleasant. Good for bunch of people to rela

Loved it!Food was tasty and very good quantity for very affordable prices. loved the view of the sea and having a table on the sand, could not get any better after a full day of actives on the island!live band/ music was also appreciated.one thing i have to mention, by the time we choose a table and picked what we wanted to eat and went to the counter to order, the man serving us said they have closed the kitchen for the night and can’t serve food! Luckily the chef behind him (after he saw how devastated and hungry we looked at 9:30pm) advised we can order pizza or chicken dishes.so it was not appreciated that kitchen decides to close without any prior warning to customers still entering the restaurant!Just a simple greet to people coming in and advising maybe kitchen closed OR will be closing (give a time) would be great.apart from that, am glad we got to eat and enjoy the sea view.highly recommend

A place to relax after having fun in sentosa.The place serve tasty pizza and of course some cocktails and drinks..A light music in background helps you to relax under a roof. Loved the view of sea sitting on comfortable seat

Not as good as I was expecting. Food was average and drinks were not very exciting. Location is ok but still just looking at container ships really

I travelled to Singapore in November 2016 and as part of our tour, me and my husband, were to spend a day at Sentosa. Towards the evening we headed to the beach and came across a food set-up. However, we kept walking all around it and couldn’t find an entry. There was a much larger area where there was a fabulous beach restaurant- Coasties (where we went eventually) but we thought that let us explore all the options at hand and take an informed decision (which we most certainly did afterwards and finally understood why only one person was sitting in this place whereas Coasties was full).So, my husband came across an area where there were wood logs separating Sand Bar from Coasties and he thought that he could stoop through and get in the maze like “whatever the hell” they call themselves. As soon as he moved in, a female came and started shouting at him that he has broken a rule and he cannot come in from the beach side. My husband apologized and tried explaining that he could not find the entry and so he thought he will just move into the eating outlet to take the menu and since none of the waiters were looking his way he thought he will simply walk in and see the menu. The female called another male colleague of hers and this guy came and started calling my husband “idiot, moron, stupid”. He started shouting at the top of his lungs and everyone started looking in our direction. My husband apologized again and explained that there was no one to help him and he simply wanted to see the menu. To this the guy pointed to the crowd and said, “you see all these people, they are looking at you and thinking who is this stupid guy, why is he coming in the restaurant from between the wooden logs, he is an idiot”. He kept hurling abuses at us and once when he saw his audience is dispersing he said “dude you still want to see the menu”. That is when we decided to walk out.I would never recommend anyone to go to Sand Bar. The management needs to know that they are a refined version of a beach shack and not a 5 star. Through the entire evening I did not see even one person walk in to this place. I cannot say anything about the food because I did not have it but you have the worst staff with disgusting manners. They need to understand that they are part of the hospitality industry, and trust me when I say they do not know the meaning of the word hospitality. To the management I want to say that you have a nice looking place but you should pay attention to the kind of staff you are hiring. They have no manners and do not know how to talk to people. I agree my husband did not walk through your main entrance but it is not a crime, anyone can make an honest mistake and if someone is apologizing listen to it rather than abusing them. To all the travelers, think twice before walking into this place. Go to Coasties, it has a beach feel to it, tasty food and helpful servers

Beautiful spot at the beach. They have a nice menu. Its a bit more Western food. They have nice options for share platters. We had steak with wedges and a salad. The steak was perfectly grilled. The wedges were quit large, which personally isn't my favourite. But the flavour was delicious and my friend did like them a lot. Staff is friendly. We had a great night

We visited Sentosa Island and were about to embark on a stroll along the beachfront when a thunderstorm rolled in and the beach was cleared. We took refuge at the Sand Bar / Flame Cafe and ordered cocktails which were very peasant. It is located on the edge of Siloso beach not far from the chairlift. A basic food menu is available including burgers, kebabs and roast chicken and there is a cocktail bar along side - brilliant. Staff continued to serve customers throughout the downpour as quite a crowd developed. It was evident that this was a common occurrence and nobody was pressured to move on until the storm passed. Thank you for your hospitality and great cocktails

I went to this bar restaurant about one year ago and I was already impressed at that time. Being back now, I have to confirm the excellent quality of the meat. We ordered an interesting meat platter very well cooked, abundant and also very tasty. Considering also the nice place near the beach, it was worth to spend 76$ for the two platters. I highly recommend this place and the meat platter

We had an early lunch here soon after arriving on the Island. Food was nice. Hubby enjoyed his ribs. Service was good. Even though they had just opened, everything seemed well organised. My only negative from our visit was, the bar-tender had not yet started, so our drinks were limited to the small selection in the fridge. Abit disappointing, but still very much enjoyed our lunch.Great location too of course

Quiet around 6 pm. Order at bar. Views out over small beach. Didn't eat but do sharing platters for c. $40 for 2-

All our groups good orders tasted great as we discussed it afterwards, the service was prompt and courteous too... much better than bikini bar just along from it. Rated very good, & I would recommend it to others to try.

I went to this bar again and they are now serving Mojito's in proper highball glasses. The Mojitos were mixed well and tasted as a mojito should. Big improvement vs the prior time I was there.Billy/Management, any chance you could bring back the bands on weekends or at least one weekend night each week? The house music DJ just doesn't fit a topical beach bar IMO

Visited with friends on a Wednesday evening. We had limited time since we wanted to catch 7.40pm laser show. Staff were not particularly friendly but overall service was ok. We ordered two beers and two margaritas but the cashier did not register the margaritas order and as a result we had to go back to the cashier to reorder after waiting for half an hour

Good place to have a chill, grab a beer or cocktail and relax while the kids play on the beach. We got a table later on and grabbed some lunch. Good salads, Hotdogs for kids, Fish and Chips was fresh and tasty. Recommend for a quick bite whilst on the beac

Great place for a cold beer after being on the Luge They have a decent HAPPY HOUR with $7 beers & other drinks from 6pm till 9pm with friendly staff Worth a visit for a cold one on the sand

This bar on the beach used to be pretty good but has really gone down hill. They used to have decent bands on the weekend nights but the band quality went downhill and the last time we were going to go there they had a DJ instead of a band and the DJ was playing some Euro/Tech house music. Might be a good DJ for a night club but this is a mellow beach bar so I really don't get it. Also, the bar tenders are so bad...slow and tiny drinks that are about 80% ice and served in small low ball glasses. Maybe ownership is struggling financially but it's no solution to rip off your customers with cheap and small pours. I have never seen a decent bar or bartender serve a Mojito in a low ball glass but at Sand Bar that's how they do it. Management there will probably give you some marketing spin about how that's "their presentation" but a Mojito should never be served in a small low ball glass. If they wanted to be a bit sly they could sneak by with a Collins glass maybe but a low ball glass never -- if that's "their presentation" they should change it since it's just wrong.Unfortunately, after living in Singapore and going to this bar for 6+ years we probably won't go back again
