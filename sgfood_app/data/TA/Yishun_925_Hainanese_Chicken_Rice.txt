The rice is oily and taste good, the chicken has no bone but less chicken compared to other hawker in Yishun industrial park, but this is worth for 3 sgd

For sin$4 you get a serving for one with a light soup and bits of achar. First queue to pay. There you have to let them know where you are sitting and you will be given a slip of paper. It is usually a short wait for the chicken rice to be served to you. The chicken seem to be not as juicy as the last time I had it. Still a good taste. Nice to have if you are in the area. But I do not think it a worth the trip if you are all the way in the West. Still worth to give it a go if you are in the area.

One of the locals told us about this amazing chicken rice place in Yishun which is in the far north. We took an Uber which is about 30 mins ride from town to Yishun to try this Chicken Rice. It truly lives up to its name. The chicken is smooth and tender, not dry and flaky like the chicken rice we had at Newton Hawker centre. Rice is fragrant and really cheap at just $0.50 for a big bowl. Soup is great and you can get extra servings if you wish to do so. Go early though as the place close at 7pm

This review is for their Sembawang branch, located opposite of Sembawang Shopping Center, opposite of the famous White Bee HoonSimple setup restaurant, clean, neat, menu with lots of choices of dishes besides chicken riceWe ordered half chicken, bean sprouts, 2 plates of rice and 2 barley drinks, it cost us around $25+, Price of half chicken is reasonable @$13, but the bean sprouts is kind of rip off, price @$8 for small plateNevertheless, their chicken rice is probably the better one in Sembawang region, good enough that I need not travel to South of Singapore for other

Average Hainanese chicken served with chili sauce with a kick! The chicken itself is tender but nothing much to shout about. It's not the fleshiest chicken around or the best tasting. There may be a queue but it moves fast. SGD 30 for a whole Hainanese chicken - expensive to say the least.

This stall serves the best hainanese chicken rice. There are always Ling queue during lunch time and dinner time. They serve boneless chicken with chicken rice. So soft and tasty. I always bought the steamed chicken liver to accompany my food. The chilli which comes with the rice is super hot. So be careful. Don't burn your lips
