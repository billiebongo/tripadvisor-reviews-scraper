I like the decor, I like the foods. This is my 2nd times to visit here. This is a great place for family gathering.

Tried the white duck ramen, absolutely delicious. My companion had fried calamari and she was equally pleased with her dish. Service very efficient. Helpful and friendly staff

This restaurant is located at basement of Bugis Junction. We ordered the Chicken Karage n chicken teriyaki sets. Both tasted ok but definitely not the best in time. The Price is pretty ok too.

I have been craving ramen for ages, so as soon as I landed and settled into the hotel, I made my way to Menya.
Ordering straight from ipad - hi tech!
Cha shu tsukemen and a chawanmushi side. YES!

Fairly authentic ramen shop chain, that’s decently priced. Servings aren’t huge, but they’re well prepared. Gyozo a little overdone for my taste and missing the sweet soy (no condiments on the table to flavour your meal is a bit of a let down) but over all fairly decent. Bonus marks for having legitimate vegetarian ramen options though

My husband and i were looking for a place to eat. It was really crowded, every seats in every restaurant were taken. Lucky for us, we spotted seats in this resto and just went inside cos there were no one waiting. Didnt really had a high expectation for the food because other ramen resto was really full and so many people waiting outside. Well, turned out the ramen was amazing. I would say it was really cheap for 2 ramen set cost us only $28. We came back again a few days after.

Menya Musashi in Bugis Junction, I should say is close to the authentic japanese ramen that I love in Japan but the place needs TLC by the crew. We were seated beside the kitchen with a window frame separating us. Dust around the frame is visible (quite thick) and the kitchen needs to be tidied. The food is delicious but please manager, clean up your restaurant

My friend was craving for ramen and we decided to give this a try. Both of us ordered char siu ramen set. They are four soup base to choose from and we had chosen the original white soup base. Both of us like the soup very much! I personally like it because the soup is thick and it's not too salty. The portion was quite generous too. We had a chawamusi and a plate of gyoza as our side dishes. The chawamusi was very smooth and soft, while the gyoza dipped with sauce was just heaven. A nice lunch. Got to try their other soup base soon

We had a wonderful lunch just now. Ordered few bowls of ramen and service staff provide good service, fast in serving ice water and noodles is soft and delicious. Soup base is nice too. They even refilled water and oolong tea constantly without asking.Each bowl costs between $10.90 to $15.90. Will recommend all to give it a try as it's worth it.

I ordered a premium set which included ramen in black broth and some side dishes. And I found it was under my expectation. The broth was salty with two thin sliced pork. Service was fast but unfriendly! Just came because we had thought it would be a good Japanese restaurant, but we were a bit disappointed. Not recommend this restaurant at all
