The service crew will explain the dishes presented to you and are attentive to guests.
Food quality exceeded my expectations. The sides were fresh and steak was cook to my preference.
Highly recommended to celebrate special occasions with your loved ones!

The Ribeye is great! but I struggle to see the point for their famous Spin Salad as to the Spin Salad's taste? well it is shocking sad and bad. The sides are typically American, need I say more. Just go for the meat.
2
premium price for so-so food.. expect proper fine dinner at that kind of price range.. rather.. it felt like casual dining
4
I've got tired of all the oriental food so Lawrys came like real refreshment ! Good american bbq,the've got good ribs,very tasty and jucy
5
We celebrated our guest’s birthday and our guest was certainly pleased with the ambience. The red wine served was fantastic. The service was excellent and we had a hearty time.
5
The food was excellent. Service was impeccable - the service staff was aiming to please. Will definitely go back again

I met some Chinese friends in Singapore and they invited their friends and we went to Lawryâ€™s. Great atmosphere and very attentive and impeccable service. I had the English cut prime rib which was three slices of melt in your mouth prime rib. Best prime rib I have ever had!!!! Great side dishes and the other people all raved about their selections. Great deserts as well and it was an outstanding experience.
4
I love LAWRYS.the roast beef is great and the side dishes are delicious.the mashed potatoes,spinach,and yorkshire pudding.I love to go during lunch time because they have a lunch buffet.lots of veggies,salads,cold cuts,soup.the veggies I love ,so fresh and crispy,like freshly cut from the garden.Havent been to their newly renovated akasaka main branch.would love to go one of these days.The ebise place is good to but I love the akasaka ,it was so gorgeous then,I am wondering what it looks now.See you soon LAWRYS

It's always a nice dining experience in Lawry's. I first dined here in 2012, and since then I always try to find time to dine here each time I visit Singapore.In my last visit, it was on Friday night and the restaurant was very full. Yet, Lawry's is able to provide not only a consistently high quality of their foods, but also the same warm welcome & interaction with the guests in such a busy situation.The waitresses are very attentive to the needs, e.g. they immediately offered additional au jus when they noticed at their first glance that my plate was started getting dry.My compliment to the staff, Mona & Yaya for their friendly service & attitude, and also Imran the duty manager who lead the staffs to deliver the best value to the customers
5
Food was scrumptious, ambience was great, and staff were very caring and considerate. I am pregnant, and they offered a back pillow, and also took care to explain the ingredient of each dish to me and asked for my preference. Was there for a birthday celebration, and there was even a complimentary photo and slice of cake.
4
Food was delicious and we like the atmosphere though I find that the prime rib was a tad cold, I would prefer it warmer. Overall was a good experience.
5
The ribs here were excellent. Very worth it with Amex. Staff was polite and attentive. Atmosphere was perfect - cosy, plush seats, with not much noise despite the crowd. Had a complimentary birthday cake slice and photo print-out as well. Will definitely be back!
4
First time to the restaurant and service was very good. They even took a photo and printed out with complimentary photo frame.

Ordered their prime rib which comes with their famous spinning salad, prime rib, mash potato and yorkshire pudding (bread).1. The spinning salad is a show. it is basically iceberg lettuce combined with their very acidic vinaigrette. (The menu says it is a mixture of many more types of greens, but trust me, you cant find/taste them)2. Prime rib. It was well cooked, but lacked flavor. kinda sad when this is your signature dish. Again, the best part of the meat is when the "chef/butcher" wheels in his cart to cut your prime rib. Then after a few bites, you are either happy that you didnt order their biggest cut or sad that you did order a big cut.3. Potatoe: bah, (my comment is as bland as their mash potatoe)4. Yorkshire pudding: first time having it, so dont know if its better then others. but not really my thing and kinda found it a weird combination
5
There is no better roast beef than this one! It comes with a spinning bowl salad served chilled and a cold fork! Then the choice of the wagon, California cut, English cut, Lawry cut or the giant Jim Brady cut at more than 400g! It comes with mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. Horseradish comes with fresh and normal. Cream corn, creamy spinach and buttered peas comes extra! The taste of the beef is just awesome
4
We have been to Lawry's for over a decade and the quality of food has been generally consistent. Once, the yorkshire pudding was still cold in the middle - but when we mentioned this to the manager who asked us how the food was, he insisted on taking it away straightaway (though we were OK) and gave us fresh yorkshire pudding. The restaurant's speciality is their beef, so we normally don't bother to order anything else. The beef's quality has been consistent over the years - and we normally order it medium rare. This is also the only restaurant in Singapore we know so far which serves yorkshire pudding (usually excellent). I wouldn't bother though with their desserts - which are so so. Also, there is no need to order any extra vegetable as any choice of beef prime rib comes with their spinning salad, and more than enough bread and mashed potatoes. BTW, you can ask for extra helping of the yorkshire pudding - just be sure you don't waste it and finish every single piece
4
I was there with my family for a birthday celebration. The service from the crew was great - attentive to details and we even had a birthday song by the crew, a photo of us and a cake. The food was great too, though maybe a bit pricey if not for the birthday promotion
4
The Lawry's Cut Prime Rib had a great tender texture and charred flavour on the edges. Unfortunately, the gravy and the beefy flavours weren't strong enough and got monotonous after eating about 200 grams. If you come here, it might be best to order a smaller portion of prime rib, or share a prime rib as well as a different menu item with another perso
5
Amazing detail to attention on food ingredients and choices of dishes. We had lunch and were taken care by Astuti and were even served with a complementary dessert and photo on the occasion of my wedding anniversary. The seafood pasta and salads are great for one’s tastebuds.

I was here for bday lunch with mom and hubby. We ordered the singapore cut as it is the cheapest (haha) and also come with salad, mashed potato, and yorkshire pudding -> so it was a perfect portion for our south east asian belly. If you’re american I don’t think this is enough. Anyway, since it is my bday week the third main course is free! And i reckon several other people celebrating their birthdays their, at least 4 others. I think it is a good place for special occasion.My mom is wearing hijab/ scarf, we don’t request for a specific meal but the staff (we were served by anna and another one; this other waitress is whom i refer to) were quick to point out that we may not want the wine infused meat. I was touched that she understands what my mom needs even we don’t request such thing. (I guess a lot of guests with similar needs have been here)The meat was tender and good. It was a good meal for me but not great. However, the ambience is nice as we spend quite some time there and ordered some desert as well (which i found just so-so).Since it is my bday they brought a cake and light the candle and even sing for me and took some pictures, send to my email and print out one instantly. Love it!Oh and at the beginning they gave bread as a complimentary and it was nice.It is worth a try for sure and i like how they really ‘serve’ you. Would probably try other types of meat next tim
5
We were so blessed to be able to enjoy a complimentary set dinner here. Didn’t expect such a posh restaurant. Reminds us of some of the restaurants in the US.
Very welcoming staff. Lovely ambience. Great food. Awesome experience.
4
Very special Meat restaurant , quite expensive .
very good service , impressive wine list
pleasant Atmosphere
5
Title says it all. Service was great with tasty food. Prompt to our requirements through the night..
5
It was the ideal place for a birthday celebration. We were there for lunch. We were greeted by the receptionist and allocated to a table with good lighting and window view. The ribs were great. Service was excellent as usual and great value. Thank you!
5
Been here for a few times now and it never fails to delight me. The portions are big (justifies the price) and quality consistent. Service couldn't be better- our water was filled at such frequency that it never goes below half.
3
Beef was nice. Other dish ok. Can be noise slight if there is event like birthday
Since i dont drink alcohol. Limited beverage choices
5
It is a nice place to celebrate birthdays. with good deals. and went home with an instant photo to keep. Overall, it is a nice place for semi casual dining, but it definitely come with a price as well. so be prepared to spend about 100++ per pax. for 1 starter, 2 mains, 1 side and 2 drinks
2
We headed to Lawry s for dinner as we kept a good memory from 4 uears ago. We ordered the ribeye which was the same I can cook at home, crabcakes which tasted like breaded frozzn fish you can eat at the canteen and spinach with a terrible texture. Ambiance is nice and it s the only positive point. Maybe we should have gone for the signature cut? we ll never know it becaise we will never get the chance to come bac
5
I always enjoy the experience at Lawry's since the first time I stepped into it many years ago. While I wouldnt call myself a regular, every trip had been fun. The service is good and while it had changed over the years, remained their main selling point. For steak people, please warned that a prime rib is different and dont go there expecting the same steak experience. I am both a steak and a prime rib person so I enjoy them for what they are
5
Lawry's is located inside Mandarin Orchard Hotel. I'm ordered Singapore Cut, Foie Gras, and Crab Cake. Chef mix food and serve in front of us, so we can choose doneness level. I choose a medium level and after I ate it, the prime rib was delicious. It served with mash potato and spinach. Foie gras and crab cake also delicious.The waitress was friendly and the service also good. When I was there, the restaurant was crowded, probably because it's lunch hour
4
reservation was smooth with nothing to complain about. visited the restaurant for my
husband’s birthday celebration. great food and excellence service.
5
Thanks for the awesome evening. Food was really amazing. Service standards was top notch. Celebrated my partner’s birthday at Lawry’s and the experience and memories were priceless. Must try the Cod Fish!
5
It took me awhile to dine at Lawry’s and I finally did! Loved the ambience, professional staffs and most importantly the food. Quality prime ribs and steak place with the best cut and best meat.
5
Always a show, good for family and friends. Great ambiance, delicious cocktails. Their mud pie is the best in Singapore!
4
The service staffs in this upscale restaurant is both attentive and efficient despite running a full house when I visited. They diligently checked with the diners to ensure that both the food quality and service standards are up to expectations. Their world-renowned roasted prime rib of beef and Yorkshire pudding are certainly worthy of their reputation
5
Pretty much does what it says on the tin, fine prime rib with all the trimmings.A little expensive when you add up the extras with wine and ++ but on the whole a great atmosphere and good food with service to match. One of those places where even though it is really busy you aren't aware of the noise and other people around you so feels like you are the only people there and that is hard to find.Professional service to the extent where they didn't bat an eye when my daughter asked for Yorkshire Puddings and Gravy for dessert
5
Service is excellent. I made reservation via Chope app, and indicated that it’s my friend’s birthdag. They have noted it down, and without me verbalising/reminding them on the day itself, they brought out the usual birthday cake. Spilt wine one the remaining 1/4 of pudding and our wait staff offered to replace it with a new one. Paid for using AMEX LoveDining’s promo, so it’s value for money.
5
We celebrated my friends birthday and our wedding anniversary and Lawry did us proud. Excellent food and service as usual and then a lovely touch with Birthday and Anniversary cakes and of course the excellent singing of Happy Birthday from the lovely staff. A suberb night and we will be back more regularly!
5
Lovely, attentive and exceptional service the moment we walked into the restaurant and during the entire lunch. This place is highly recommended for celebration. Nice ambience and food on point. If you are having a celebration, they will serve a complimentary cake/dessert and they always ask when you make a reservation. We didn’t have any. Just a normal lunch for me and my son during the school holidays.We had:Hokkaido scallops and shrimps $28Pan seared goose foie gras $38 (the fattest liver I ever had)Truffles rosemary crusted lamb $75 (portion could be bigger)The California cut 160g $80 with Yorkshire pudding, spinning salad and mashed potatoes (we wondered how the Chef knew the weight since we didn’t see any weighing scale)Silver side trio $15 for peas, corn and spinach. (The waiter did ask if we wanted the extra but didn’t mention about the price, only found out from the bill, just be warned here if you don’t want to pay extra.)We will be back
4
It’s hard to imagine it now, but if you wanted to eat at a nice steakhouse in Singapore in the 2005, you didn’t have a lot of choice.Dazzling modernity might not be an epithet that the casual visitor would associate with an Lawry’s today, but in 12.5 years ago, it was the jewels in the crown of Singapore’s restaurant scene. The dining area itself oozes character and charm. We dined in an unrushed, relaxed atmosphere, and the service looked effortless and matched the high quality of the food.And the steak? There’s either good steak or bad steak, and this is firmly in the former camp. Nothing revolutionary, but exactly the food I love to eat. It’s a serious piece of meat, imbued with the sort of deep ferric tang that only experience can bring.And so Lawry’s trundles on. You have to take your hat off to them, really. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
5
Tender n juicy which is one of the better ribs i had tasted. Service was excellent and always checking on you if there is anything they can help with.
4
Ambience, food and service exceeds expectations. Family love the warm reception and service is impeccable.
5
came here because of AMEX 50% promo. Rib is tender and delicious. Crabcake is very good. Lobster portion is a bit small to fill the appetite. Service is the highlight. though pricey if not for the AMEX promo. Overall very good dining experience
4
The food is good, the atmosphere is nice, service is fantastic.
The down side of the visit is the food is not proportion out nicely in our opinion.
5
Great service, food quality and ambience. Don’t forget about the 50% AMEX platinum card promotion. Very worth it
5
Other than the lobster tail served cold, I’m still pleased with their service and food. The instant photo taken could be better. The service was still good and ambience was comforting.
4
Celebrated hubby's bday and got 50% for 2nd main course. Good service and a slice of birthday cake n photo from Lawry's. Salad, mushroom and steak are great!
5
First visit to Lawry's and it was indeed memorable!! Went for the set meal with spinning salad, appertizer, main course and dessert. Quality prime ribs (requested for medium) and appertizers! The sides that come with the prime rib were also good, such as sweet corn or cream spinach. The bread was also fresh and warm. The staff was very attentive, one of the best service level experienced. For celebrating occasions, staff will also offer complimentary cake with candle, picture taken and framed, they will send a soft copy of the picture to you if you provide email address and feedback form information. Prices are indeed high, most seems to go there for special occasions! Reservations is definitely preferred
5
Celebrated my two kids' birthday there and had a wonderful time. The steak was delicious so was their signature dish. Order the cream corn it was mouth-watering. It wasn't just the food that made it memorable, it was the service, the smiles and the attention to details. Thank you for the wonderful experience
3
I have always go to lawry's when i crave a nice prime rib. We had 2 orders of the prime ribs california cut and 2 lamb cutlets. The prime rib was good but we found the jus too salty and heavy on the Oxo (beef essence cube) taste. We did enjoy the salad which was nicely chilled and crispy and the yorkshire pudding perfect. The lamb cutlets were not very flavorful though. We also had 2 starters, the beef jalapeno bruschetta which was miniscule and quite unremarkable. The other, the crab cakes were nice. The mushrooms side that we ordered was way too salty. For desert we ordered the crepe suzette which was just sweet with hardly any orange taste in the sauce. The crepes were dry as cardboard.The coffees were lukewarm. However the manager was super nice. He was attentive and accommodating, even replacing our coffee for a much hotter cuppa.The good service made up for the lack of consistency of the food
5
Went to celebrate a birthday. The beef was excellent. Service was good and attentive. Portion were generous. Food was served fast after we ordered. Wonderful meal.
5
TOP notch in everything.from the point I walk into the restaurant till I leave. Never fail to amaze me every visit.
4
This was our eighth time that we held a celebration at Lawry's. The staff, the service, but most of all , the food has been consistently exce
5
We were there celebrating my niece birthday. The warm and friendly staff gave her a royal treatment. Everyone had a great time over the good food. To my surprise their seafood pasta was really good and even better than their lobster.
5
To be honest, i havent been here for a while and yet, nothing changes. Still the same friendly service, top notch food, excellent over all . two thumbs up !
4
Nice ambiance with friendly service staff. Their signature prime rib, salad and the lobster tail were fantastic! Kids were each given a cute cow plush as souvenir.
5
We always wanted to dine at Lawry's and so took the chance to do so on the wife's birthday and the experience was wonderful!The food was great, starting from the starter bread and butter, salad with in-house dressing. We also ordered their wine on xmas promo at 68++ which was a steal. We then had the sample apetiser at S$41 which comprised foie gras topped with grape jam which complimented very well, beef bruschetta and crab cake. For our mains, we shared the Lawry's cut which is a large cut of medlium rare roasted rib eye at S$120++ and a medium lamb chop marinated with rosemary and garlic at S$75++.The whole meal set us back by approx S$350 after a 20% discount thru Amex. We thoroughly enjoyed the food and would definely be returning customers
5
Had lunch and we ordered the Singapore Cut and California Cut. Both were very good. Portions are huge if you include the salad and the yummy Yorkshire pudding. We would have wanted desserts but were simply too full. Service was good and friendly and the ambience was nice too.
5
Came for dinner and got a table by the window. Service was excellent (most of the time), and food is great. Had the Lawry’s cut, together with the pudding and mashed, it proved abit too much to finish. The doneness was cooked to perfection, that’s most important in my steak. The only down side is the slightly higher price
4
The quality of food never fails. Juices are new addition to the drink list, very refreshing. We asked for a table with a view and we got one. I guess making advance reservation help. With American Express card promotion, it is really value for money. Highly recommended
5
Fantastic service & prime rib was awesome as per usual. Very festive atmosphere for the season as well. Highly recommend!
5
This is my 4th birthday spent in Lawry's The Prime Rib. The quality of the food and friendliness of the staff is consistently good...
5
Service was excellent as staff is attentive! Love the portion! Medium rare was done perfectly too, spinning salad taste excellent
5
Wonderful service, delicious food and such a cosy atmosphere. It’s Always a joy to dine at Lawry’s. Amex offer makes it even better!
4
Celebrated my wife's birthday at Lawry's. The service was attentive. The surprise cake at the end of the meal was an excellent touch.
5
Visited this place for a joint birthday celebration and was pleasantly surprised with the interior and the atmosphere. All the staff were very attentive and you will be able to get their attention within a very short time. Highlights were the salad spinning and the chef prepared my main (I had the english cut) live at the wagon. The complimentary cake was really good and of course, special mention to Rathieka and everyone else! You guys were AMAZING and I will be back! Thank you Lawry's for making the birthday dinner so special and awesome
4
Not a special occasion but a crave for beef. Had never been to Lawry’s but had heard great reviews of it.I loved the deco in the restaurant.. it’s grand yet cozy. Service staff were alert and attentive.We ordered the Signature prime ribs and the crab cakes and we loved the food. There should be improvement done on how the beef was brought to our table side and craved. We believed the design of the silver push cart can be improved upon
4
Medium rare done perfect and you will never go wrong ordering their signature roast beef. Their famous spinning salad was more of a gimmick and not impressive. Bread rolls were warm and their yorkshire pudding went well with the beef. Service was a little dismal. Our server dripped wine all over the glasses and table cloth while pouring and did not bother to clean up. Had some questions on the mains and she was brusque.
3
Very old fashioned restaurant in terms of food, service, and decor. Food is just average - nothing special or memorable about it. The spinning salad was probably cool 20 years ago, but when presented at the table, it tastes slightly worse than supermarket salad bar. The prime rib is OK, nothing to rave about. Steak is also average.Service is polite and well-meaning, but not very smooth
3
The meal was ok and service was okay throughout the meal. At the end of the meal, I asked for the bill. A waitress came with the bill and when she saw my credit card, announced loudly at the table in front of my guests I get 50% discount with the credit card. While I appreciate her ‘honesty’ it caused me some awkwardness and embarrassment in front of my guests. Wish she had done it more discreetly.
4
The food is average but what make up for the food is their service. Excellence service crew! The atmosphere is warm and my kids love the christmas decorations.
4
Beautiful view of Orchard Street while dining. Service was good and lovely atmosphere with trendy songs.
4
great food as always.. We had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant, When ever we visit Singapore, Lawry's The Prime Rib is always on our list of places to go.
5
Nice service, nice food. And birthday with complimentary photo, cake. Happy dinning.
Price a bit expensive, but still acceptable.
5
There for a birthday celebration - presented with a free slice of birthday cake, birthday song and a commemorative photo.
Good experience overall.
5
It was my very first visit to Lawry’s to celebrate my birthday with husband. Made a reservation through Chope, and they have an interesting offer for birthdays. The food was great, ordered a lawry’s cut and it was soo thick! But am more impressed with the service. They gave a free slice of cake with candle and sing the bday song when they delivered the cake. They also took a bday picture for you, it was simple but special. Somehow there was a misunderstanding about the payment with voucher, but they settled quickly without any arguments, and they even said sorry. Thank you Lawry’s, u made my day very special!Will recommend this place for bday celebration to my friends.
1
Avoid at all cost for thanksgiving dinner if you are expecting the traditional turkey that they used to serve. They have gone cheap!!! They have replaced it with smoked turkey!!!!It’s a lovely restaurant- fabulous service- the other dishes are lovely - but going cheap on stuffed turkey on thanksgiving is CHEAP!!! Celebrated thanksgiving twice here before and last night was disappointing- Will never return again !!
5
Went to celebrate a birthday on Saturday night. Food was really good (make sure you try the roast ribs, a truly special dish). It was a full house but the service was excellent with the service staff apologising if they took a little long on any requests. Told them it was my father's birthday and we were served a complimentary slice of cake that came with both a song and a photo for us to keep. Definitely a good place to go to celebrate a special occasion (counted at least 10 birthdays the night we were there).
4
Was thinking of places to go for lunch and since Lawry’s is available through Chope, decided to try it out. Service was personalized and was lucky enough to get the window seats though it was jus the orchard street view. Food was good though plating could have been better :
5
We made a hassle free booking thru Chope and visited on 4 Nov. We ordered the Signature Roast Prime rib English cut and the Angus Ribeye. Both were simply tender and juicy. The Yorkshire pudding was one of the best we have ever tried. Only regret is not trying their lobster tail. Service staff was friendly and polite.
4
As usual, the food is always good.
never wrong going for their beef ribs. crab cake was a bit disappointing this time round.
the fillet mignon is awesome
5
Dined in with my family and we had a great time! The staff were very attentive and presented the dishes well. Absolutely love the beef - it's too die for!!!
Would definitely recommend and can't wait to come back! 😋
4
We have a very good experience, the service, food and the whole place are wonderful.
However it is a tab expensive. Good for special occasion
5
Good Services by the Staff!
Overall Experience was very good!
i will recommend to my friends about Lawry's.
1
I like a piece of beef, but selecting and cooking a rib eye that would cost at a good butcher at most S$ 15 for 10 times that price is really wrong. the food is good but simple, fries are not house made, sauces are good but there's no garnish, no veg and the ceasar salad we ordered is not spectacularS$ 150 per head for salad, steak and mashed potatoes (no wine, no drinks!) is really outrageous, the atpmosphere is pompous and old style, staff are friendly but overall not worth a recommendatio
5
Attended the restaurant few times (mostly business meeting) and reminded myself to give a review at least. Very nice environment and quality of food is good. Even if you decided to skip their signature prime rib, seafood and lamb are worth to try too. Price a little bit higher vs others but certainly worth to visit especially on business lunch. Will continue to support
5
Often visited this place . Love the prime ribs and crab cakes .Crab cakes as a starter with tartar source and lemon squeezed just perfected the rich creamer cakes .English medium cut prime ribs which was tender, juicy over soft over reddish source with side meshed potatoes .Will always love to return to this place 
5
For many years, my Son will choose Lawryâ€™s To celebrate his birthday.since I brought him to the restaurant (@ Paragon) the first time in 2009 or 2010. We always go for the prime rib (classic cut @88) the beef is so juicy and tender.try the crab cake too. Love the fullness of crabmeat inside.
5
Food was delicious as always with top notch service. As we were there to celebrate my husband's birthday, he was offered with a small complimentary cake, a birthday song, and family photo taken. While there was also a birthday promo to get one of the a la carte for free, the staff offered to check for me to see which offer would save me more (as i was also using my AMEX card). Overall, great lunch and everyone enjoyed
3
~ this is the second time in ever at Lawry's so I'd had the roast, seen the salad show and been thru them labeled condiments... so I'm gonna have me some newBeef Bruschetta - YUMz x1Kurobuta Baby Back Ribs - slurpylicious YUMz x2Lawry's Mud Pie - YUMz x1and that Rib Eye popping display of condiments & garnishes hanging on bended cutlery, ok that's definitely not your normal steakhouse everso why not the roast beef, it could be different but I still saw that the cut would make eating it a chore so well the other items on the menu hit the spot :
4
Very delicious food, great service, and nice atmosphere. However, the expectation of customers' attire seem to have dropped. T-shirt and shorts are also allowed into the restaurant. I miss the times when customers had to dress up very well to enter.
4
Lawry’s never fails me. The quality of food is always good.
However, they changed the layout for kid’s meal and was cramped onto a much smaller plate making it difficult for the child to eat.
4
Had a wonderful dinner with my family. Manager and staffs are very attentive! Will definitely visit again.
4
Service at Lawry's was great! The staff were really attentive and patient with my family. Portion of food was good and the done-ness of the steak was great! It was a great experience to celebrate my dad's 60th!
5
Excellent service from the staff. Great food and nice view of Orchard road. We had a great time and enjoyed the night.
5
Good ambience, helpful staff, great introduction of the menu and awesome food! Definitely will be going back again.
4
We went there for a birthday dinner and were quite happy with Lawry's. Staff were very friendly and well trained. They took special attention to give us a nice seat near the window (upon my request on my reservation) and surprised us with a mini birthday cake slice. Food was otherwise equally great, with a pleasant and lively atmosphere to match. I would return and recommend it to friends or family.
5
I was given a gift certificate so I went to try the place and asked for a take away meal. I was there at approximately 6:00 pm. There was no fuss and the staff took my order. The meal was ready and packed within 12 minutes of my order!I was impressively surprised at the customer service, quality and quantity of food served and the atmosphere. I wish I could have stayed. When I arrived home I found the steak was perfectly cooked and everything had been nicely packed.I will definitely return for a meal with friends or clients.
5
We can not fault anything about our experience at lawry's! The service was lovely; had our own personal waiter. The meals came out quickly and were all cooked to perfection. To end our perfect dinner, the chef sent out a complimentary chocolate dessert as a congratulations on our engagement. They also took a photo of us and printed it out which was beautiful. Highly recommend this restaurant, definitely worth it for steak lovers; best steak we've ever had!
5
The set menu was lovely and filling. I'd recommend a 160g for average apoetites... the rest of the courses will fill you up! Be sure to ask for a window seat if you want a nicer experience.Chope vouchers were a fiasco to use. Lawry's does not allow the voucher deduction for promotional sets so the "cash vouchers" are quite useless unless u want to use them for extra sides."A" for the service and food"C-" for chope vouchers
5
Staff were very attentive and food is great . Thank you for letting us have our favorite window seats.
5
Have always wanted to try Lawry's for a very long time.. Didn't disappoint, worth every dollar and you will see me again soon
Cheers
5
Lawry's is my go to place for great prime rib, and they did not disappoint me. Great food, and great service staff!
4
We enjoyed our familily lunch there but too bad the portion for prime rib for my daughter is too small, she claimed 😃.. She normally eats small portion of food but because the prime rib was too good she needed more.. 👍👍
3
Went there yesterday for a birthday dinner. There was 5 of us. 4 had the California cut steak and another had the lobster tails. Both dishes were above average but they charge for all the extra vegi and other sides. Only mash potatoes and a quarter of the Yorkshire pudding came with the steaks. Oh, and the cheapest glass of wine cost $21!Overall the ambiance was nice and the staff tries their best. The waitress singing happy birthday when serving the free slice of cake was a nice touch. But just ONE slice for the table of five?! Anyway, total bill, including 2 glasses of wine, was about $600 which was not exorbitant but because of the overall experience and quality of the food it did seemed a bit overpriced

Good atmosphere as you walk in, busy on a weekend (reservations needed). Was quickly seated but the service was a little slow to get started. The concept is unique (for singapore), but classic prime rib served table side, sliced from a slab of neat wheeled around in a hostess trolley. The food was good and tasty; meat was as we requested. Finished with the Crepe Suzette, which were delicious (sharing plate). The bill was punchy ($1000++ with wine, 4 PAX); I'd not rush back but it's worth a visit
3
Nice ambience. Food was not too bad. But asking customers who ordered the prime ribs if they wanted veges was underhanded. There was no mention that the veges would be charged separately. Was surprised to find that one portion of vegetables would cost $9 only when the bill was presented.

Ok so it's not the cheapest place to eat , but you get what you pay for . The service is excellent . The staff extremely attentive . The food was delicious. We had the set 3 course menu . We would highly recommend it . My Husband left his hat behind and a poor waiter was sent after us with it . We had gone down 3 escaloters before he caught up with us . Now that's going the extra Mile 
5
Food was pricey than normal but it was great, from the starters down to the desserts! The steak was cooked just the way I like it. On top of this all was the excellent customer service that was given to us. The staff was really attentive and helpful

It was a lovely experience dining at Lawry's. The restaurant was beautiful and per our reservation, they showed us to the window seat. Generally the food is good though on the pricey side. I enjoyed the English cut more than the truffle rosemary crusted lamb. Celebrated my friend's birthday at Lawry's and it proved to be a good choice. Besides the cake & birthday song, the restaurant also offers complimentary photo which they print out for us on-the-spot.
5
This was my first time here and it will not be my last. Can't wait to go again. Roast beef was very tender and delicious.
5
the service was excellent and the California cut is a must-try. My girl and I had spent a wonderful time there
5
We were there for birthday celebration. The staff were friendly, service was great and food was good!
5
So delicious and great service. I celebrated my Birthday there. They give me pictures and send e-mail to me.
4
Food was definitely above average. Quite pricey though. Service was excellent, however one feels like the staff were made to do it because they have to.
A huge number of patrons were there to celebrate someone's birthday or anniversary.
4
We personally experienced the same classy ambiance, excellent service of the Staff, good Bread, Salad, Red Wine and of course, the consistent qualify of the Prime Rib, at Orchard Singapore Branch, In Mandarin Gallery, is noticeably at par with their Beverly Hills CA Branch. Thus, celebrating a very intimate occassion, i.e. Birthday, can never go wrong... ‘Twas all worth it - classy & consistent. Thank you
4
Just had dinner there and the food was good. My prime rib was medium rare, soft and tender. The mashed potato and the spinach was yummy. Service was great and professional. However the food was pricey. This would be a good place for special events for me. I don't think I can eat this too frequently.
4
Used credit card deal to get 1 for 1, ordered 2 lawry's cuts. Tasty and large portion as always (285g of the roast is bigger than for a normal grilled steak). With all the other steak options out there these days I probably wouldn't go at full price though. My value rating bears the deal in mind
4
I went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. The restaurant offered birthday deal with 2nd main course 50% off, with a complementary cake. The ambient was good, very "atas". The waitress was attentive and friendly. They sang my wife a birthday song when they brought in the birthday cake. We were delighted to get a free photo of us from the restaurant after our meal. My wife was impressed. What can I say? Happy wife, happy life. If she is impressed, so am I. If you go as couple, please take the window seat.
5
Skip breakfast if you're heading over for lunch. Since Lawry's is famous for their prime rib, I ordered their famous Lawry's cut, which came with a salad, mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. But the highlight of the meal, of course, was the prime rib. Mine came with the bone and it was huge! I asked for medium and it was prepared to perfection. I didn't have any space for other sides or dessert
5
Why explain so much??? Just get your butt out from the chair and try out there! Best service, best steak ever. That all!
5
I came to Lawry's, thinking it's one of those normal lunch dates with my family. Not only is the food as fantastic as before, the staff celebrated my birthday without me expecting it! Thanks for the awesome food and service!
4
Been to Lawry's many times. You can always count on them for a good meal. The beef never fails to please, the staff are always pleasant and attentive.
5
The best prime rib I had in Singapore. Excellent service. We celebrated my son birthday there and they served a complimentary cake and gave us a photo. We have a memorable evening at Lawry
5
Enjoyed myself so much at Lawrys. The steak was so delicious and HUGE. The Maitre D' was so entertaining and made the experience even more enjoyable
4
Celebrated family birthday with elderly members, one of whom had trouble getting to the toilets. Steak was good. But the big surprise was when a wheelchair was produced for elderly to be wheeled to the toilets. And at the end of meal, Mona of the ladies at the front wheeled the elderly all the way to the carpark lift. Thanks for making it an enjoyable experience!
5
We are regulars at Lawrys for 20 years but they have maintained their standard. At one point, the prime rib quality dipped but last 2 visits, the beef quality has gone up right back up so very happy. The service is always excellent. My only slight complaint is that their wines aren't very good. The wine offering can certainly be improved especially for the price.
4
I didn't expect that the food presentation and service was fabulous. I would rank the portion served were incredibly value for the price you pay. Food are delicious, the ambiance was good, perhaps I think a good location to hold a mini banquette or celebration. The interiors are great for wedding photography Too. One thing I am not satisfy with was the music they play. It could be more tastefully selected classics.
5
Food quality is great and consistent. Ambiance is old style and welcoming. Rather pricey fine dining but worth it. Prime rib is juicy and tasty. Lamb chops, lobster tails, crusted cod, grilled salmon, crab cakes, spinning salad all delicious. Staff are efficient and friendly by our local standard. Parking is a little challenging especially with older people. A definite hit with the famil
3
It was a nice gesture of the restaurant to provide a complimentary birthday dessert and instant photo for us. However, it would be more pleasant if the lady taking our photo exercise more patience when we request to re-take the shot and also to help to take a photo using one of the diner's mobile phone. We understand that there are other tables are waiting for the photos to be taken but how long would it take just to retake the shot , another minute or two? If she is concerned that other diners have been waiting for too long, she could let us know that she will retake the shot for us when she is done with other tables, instead of rushing off. My other two diners ordered Seafood Duo and I had the Singapore Cut. The food was average. In terms of value for money and service level of staff, it scored badly.
5
I was very pleased with the food and especially the service. I enjoyed the birthday experience and will definitely be back for another birthday soon.
4
Celebrated my son's birthday at Lawry's. Great steak and good service. Made the evening memorable and enjoyable.
5
Wonderful service great people fantastic ambience energetic and fun server and most importantly the food and wine will make you come back for more
4
Good service. Dessert is great. But salad (with no meat) and mushroom soup (too bland) can be improved. Pricey.
5
My partner and I have been coming back to Lawry's to celebrate our anniversaries! Food and service is as always Excellent! =)
3
I ordered 2 sets meal, not too bad. The waiters are very polite and also will wait patiently for you to finish your food before serving you another.
4
Staffs were friendly, most importantly food was amazing. Excellent place for romantic couples to spend their anniversary.
5
It is very nice to bring someone to celebrate a special occasion as this is a place & a meal to remember
5
The set meal was value for money. despite it being a set meal the quality of the food was not compromised. service staff was very attentive and provided great service.
5
This is the first time introducing my colleagues and bosses to this place although I have been here several times. I was given a private room with oldies played. The songs made the ambience more cosy and relaxing. We had the 3 course meal and the food were fantastic. Everyone was impressed when the food were served. The decorations are beautiful and the taste are good. Especially the rolling bowl salad, vegetables were crunchy. Best of all, it was served with 'cold' fork! The quantity was just nice. The waitresses were friendly and smiles were on their faces throughout the event. The marketing executive whom i liaised with came personally to check if everything is in order. I highly recommend Lawry's for private event as well as family eating place. It is also a romantic restaurant for couples especially dinner time. If you are to celebrate your birthday, the staff will surprise you with birthday song and a small cake will be served with a candle. Try it for yourself, no regrets
5
Was my first visit to lawry..Their staff was very friendly and food was fantastic..would definitely come back!
4
As usual prime rib was wonderful, excellent service with a smile and nice location. Always looking forward to visit again.
5
After trying all those other steak houses, including those in New York City, Lawery's continues to satisfy time and time again. Their rib roast never disappoints. As a bonus, they really provide a treat on your birthday.
5
Lawry's has been our family's favourite steak restaurant for the past decade! I'm glad to say they never disappoint :) excellent food and service!
5
We had the Singapore cut (the rest of the portions were too big for us), along with the scallop and shrimp. It was a pleasant dining experience. The manager threw in coffees on the house.
4
Great steak, limited sides; 7 birthday celebrations on the day we were there. Lovely photo for memory on your birthday.
4
Kids were entertained by the hostess . Bought out soft toys at intervals . Good quality kids meal. Fabulous prime ribs !!!
5
Good service, good environment, good food.if you have American Express card, 2 person can get 50% off. Totally worth it
5
Had not visited for more than 15 years. This time we returned with our kids during our anniversary and had a great time. Great service and good unpretentious food.
5
LAWRY's is a must everytime I visit Singapore, and it never disappoints!! The prime rib is perfect, the salad a very nice feature, and the service is exceptional!
I would recommend this place as a must-go for all steak lovers!
5
Celebrated my birthday at Lawry's with my boyfriend, the food and service was good! Would go back again :)
4
The place has a nice and cosy ambience to dine in. Menu selection is good- service too!
love the spinning salad !
5
Their standard never change, always prime. The service also never disappointing. Very good food, good service and nice interior.
5
We had a wonderful time spent at the restaurant celebrating my friend's birthday. The staff are very attentive and their initiative to take photos and send to us is perfect!! Will definitely recommend this restaurant!! All time good!
5
Went there with family for dinner. Although Fine dinning, it was not overly priced.
Ambience was serene. Staffs were attentive and friendly. Service was excellent!
The beef steaks were cooked to our expectations. The appetizers were very good, too.
5
Since we do not eat beef we had the non beef dishes there, and those dishes were great. The service was excellent and the ambience was nice as well. Nothing to complain about.
5
I have been to Lawry's for a few times & they never failed me. I brought my family this time to celebrate my dad's birthday & Lawry's was very nice to prepare a complimentary cake & photo for memory keepsake. Service was very good where the staffs were very attentive & made suggestions when my parents had a difficult time choosing their mains. Nice ambience, great service
5
Decided to have the Lawry's cut (285g) as a birthday treat, though the portion was a tad too big for me. The meal starts with bread and a spinning salad, which was fun to watch and a good prelude. Waitress recommended to sprinkle on their house brand pepper and I liked it! The beef makes quite an entrance in a grand carving cart. Tender with a bold taste (in comparison to the asian flavour of steaks I'm more acquainted to). Throughout, the pleasant service impressed me the most. To top it off there was a complimentary birthday cake and photo
5
Heard from my colleagues that Lawry's is having an anniversary set which is very value for money, hence made a trip down over the weekend. The service is excellent. I have been greeted all the way from the door to my seat and have been asked multiple times by various staff if everything is ok. Even the executive chef was there to greet us. He is charming and very friendly. The food is great. As always, the prime beef never fails to impress. My kids love the corn and yorkshire pudding. We tried a few other items this time round. The foie gras is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The serving is generous - two thick pieces of foie gras. The sauce goes so well with it. You can ask for more sauce too. Totally satisfy my craving for the day. We had the lobster tail too. It's cooked to perfection, the meat is so sweet. For drinks, I had the National Day Cocktail, it's nice! Although we are so full from the main course, we still go for our all time favorite mud pie and the raspberry dome. The dome is very refreshing after a full meal. I like the crunchy frozen fruit bits at the side. My family and I had a great time at Lawry's. Will definitely be back again
2
Made a reservation on a Saturday evening after reading positive online review. Restaurant was not crowded when we arrived but became more as the evening progressed. Service was good and the french wine we ordered was good. That is probably about it. We had the 18th anniversary set menu. Started with famous spinning salad which is the waitress turning a metal bowl on ice - vegetables was fresh but that is about it. Appetiser sampler was ok - the foie gras was kind of overdone. Main course, we had the chicken leg (kind of dry and nothing really special) and beef prime cut (not the best meat we had, kind of over medium we asked for, and Swimming in salty sauce - you could ask for sauce to be separate but we did not know and no one asked us). Dessert was ok (mud pie was ok, the strawberry cake was too sweet). Restaurant is well decorated but food is just alright. For the price I do not think it is worth it. It is a visual experience but not a great experience for the palate. Do not think I will visit again.
5
Visit on 25th July 2017. Greeted warmly at the front counter and brought to a window seat. The range of food and discount are clearly introduced and explained. Food is fresh and the beef is tender. A nice experience in Lawry's.
5
The food was of excellent quality and my family and I were pleasantly surprised by the service standard.
5
Excellent service. Fabulous food. Good atmosphere. Staff are friendly with kids. Will definitely come back.
3
Nice ambience and setting, unique way of presenting the starter and main course. Lobster trios fresh and tasty.
5
Went to Lawry's with my boyfriend to try their Prime Beef and I must say, I'm impressed. We tried their Anniversary Set which is reasonably priced for a high end restaurant and is SUPER filling and satisfying. The atmosphere is great and the service is TOP NOTCH. Will definitely be back for more!Keep it up Lawry's
5
Amazing ambiance with an overview of parts of the busiest part of the town. Tip top service shown from the front host his sense of humor, enthusiasm and energy levels is beyond my belief. Even the manager goes around the store to make sure everyone is having a good time here. He even told us how things were prepared when we prompt.My girlfriend and I had the 4 course set lunch, trust me from the salad to deserts everything was done perfectly. Especially the Prime ribs, no wonder they take pride in it. Thank you for showing us outstanding hospitality and would totally visit again
3
Lawry's food is consistently good. Only gripe was the Over Intrusive service staff. We were trying to catch up and have good conversation but every 2 minutes someone is trying to impress us with something or ask if we're ok or whatever. Say 'sorry to interrupt' and continuing to do so doesnt hel
1
From the last time time we came, I'm surprised the food quality and service dropped so much. We ordered their anniversary set dinner with main course being steak this time. Steak can't be chewed and it taste quite bad. We found it hard to swallow. Pretty much the same for the other dishes in the set, nothing was tasty. There was foie gras in the appetizer but I haven't came across 1 that cannot be break apart by knife. Service wise the staff seemed to be trained in speaking English with slang and that's about it. They don't remember my order, particularly asking me to repeat the steak done-ness, neither do they open up the napkins or fetch a box to hold ladies bag but they did for other table so service consistency is not there
1
I booked dinner to celebrate my son's and husband's birthdays. Despite telling the receptionist at the time of making the reservation that we're celebrating 2 birthdays and calling again half an hour before we arrived (receptionist's response was 'we will take note ma'am), the restaurant brought just 1 dessert. They didn't even ask who's birthday it was prior to presenting the dessert, so it was awkwardly presented to my husband, then pushed to my son when I said it was both their birthdays. Poorly handled, poor attention to detail and poor service recovery. Fell far short of my expectations
5
I am from LA so I ate at the old Lawry's way back when. Now here in SIN on a Friday night this place was packed. We had four in our party and was seated right away. Must reserve ahead of time guys. Lawry's is not cheap eats, this is top class. There is that old world charm about the way they still keep that olden uniforms from 30 years ago. May things never change. Vagans? Please, The Prime Rib means meat! Go away!!! There is something emotional about when they wheel out that huge meat cart, The Zeppelin next to the table. I have not yet seen anyone that didn't take pictures of that thing. So good, red meat cooked just perfect. Now the wine list, way over priced. We drank two Calif cabs, what can we do? All in all this is a special occasion or date night kind of place. Five Stars
5
It's was our anniversary dinner and the service team had celebrated for us by offering us a slice of cake and a printed photo .
Highly attentive service and food was great as usual . Thank you !
5
The service and food is excellent. They made my family (who seldom dine in fine dining) felt very welcome & at ease.
4
The staff was welcoming, friendly and service good. The beef was cooked just nice. The place is really popular with locals as well as tourists so best to book table beforehand. The ambience is nice but the tables are quite close to one another.
4
A great place to go for connoisseurs of high quality beef with cosy and impeccable decor and attentive service. Pricey but worth every dime. That's a tick on my bucket list of top restaurants to go to.
4
The service and ambience is very good. Host is very friendly and polite. Went there for late lunch. The entire place is very quiet and cozy.
5
Went there Saturday 5pm, the time they just started for Dinner. It's very quiet and enjoyable ambience.I ordered the lawrys cut which is so big portion (in my opinion) a whole plate piece of meat!! Haha...My wife had the fillet mignon which was slightly over, asked for medium but come out medium well. However still acceptable.All the beef paired with Sherwood Pinot Noir made excellent dinner experience, really love it.Ooh.. American Express cardmember has awesome discount
5
Celebrated my husband's birthday here yesterday night. I've been here a few times and it never failed me. I personally love their grilled ribeye. My son loves their roast and grilled beef. Every visit, the high standard of their food and service is unwavering, I'm impressed. A must visit place for awesome good meal of red meat :
4
One of the best prime ribs in Singapore. The beef is tender and very juicy, topped with a great jus and with nice sides like corn and creamed spinach. The decor and service is very old school and you rarely see this style in Singapore these days, but it really elevates your dining experience a great deal. The staff are friendly and helpful and always serve you with a smile. A tad pricey but you really get what you pay for
5
We had a weekday family lunch here. I was surprised when we were not offered the Executive Set Lunch menu ($48++) but were instead given the Anniversary menu which was far more expensive (>$100++). I had to ask for it and the staff took a while to produce it, albeit, a tad reluctantly. Just a tip for fellow diners out there, do your homework before going out. Otherwise, we love this place
5
My first experience after ten years in Jakarta and the meal was still super delish! This time in Singpaore, I ordered the English cut as the meat was sliced thinly, a properly small portion. What was notable for me this time's the service and the efficiency of the wait staff. Solihin and his staff were much attentive and pro-actively offered service and additional items. A very comfortable environment despite a chi chi decor. Will definitely return for more when I'm in town
5
Friendly, polite and attentive staff. Great ambience, perfect timing for food being served. Would return again soon!
5
excellent service and food. Second time here and wont be the last. Totally recommend coming here for a meal.
4
Consistently good quality prime ribs and the 50% off with Amex Platinum card is awesome.
Not only is the discount applicable to the mains but the sides as well
5
I have a great time due to the nice and pleasant birthday celebration that they got for us. It was incredible.
4
Good overall experience; delicious food, and friendly, attentive service made it a memorable occasion. 4-course Father's Day menu price was a little on the high side (small portions).
5
Service good, food yummy, if you have American Express card even wroth it, 59% off of the total bill
5
Was there with my wife to celebrate her birthday. Service was great. Nice ambience. Food was good. Great place to hold a celebration.
4
Beef was Fabulous and Service was very good! Ambience was good. We would love to come back again with my family!
5
Lawry's Singapore is located at the rear of the Mandarin hotel. Little hard to findThe menu is nearly identical to that of Lawry's in Ebisu, Tokyo. Just the names have been changed I did notice that Tokyo menu prices were around 12% cheaper. The beef is great and comes with the usual Yorkshire pudding and mash potatoes. We selected the medium size cut and I had my favourite End Cut with its concentration of juices and flavours. Great place for dinner with attentive staff and good service.
3
Expensive $$$. Great food. Lives up to expectations. Service was okay accept that the music was too loud and the staff that sat me down was extremely loud. He spoke so loud with fake excitement that got us very embarrassed. Even when We left he was so loud. Plus when I sent to the toilet and back he would follow me to my seat (creepy). Due to that I feel that lawry's has lost its identity. Is it fine dining? Is it a food court ? Any way.... food was great but for a couple with just a glass of wine (house wine) each the bill was just over $360!
4
Thank you for good food, good ambience and good service similar to 5 star hotel standard and reasonable price. Service staff to the manager level are friendly, professional and always proactive to the guest. Exceptional manager solihin super humble and polite
5
first visit here. ordered the beef ribs , used the amex 1 for 1 promo (: awesome. will recommend. the photo says it all
5
Friendly staff, good ambience and fantastic food!!! Nostalgic interior of the restaurant made it surprisingly very relaxing for me while dining.
3
The Caesar salad a little bit salty.
The roasted beef was prefect cook but the beef not enough good for me and can be more seasoning .
5
It was our first time to visit the restaurant and it was a memorable experience.For starters we had the Chicken Croquette and Beef Bruschetta.MUST TRY: English Cut Prime Rib. The "spinning" salad is served tableside, the Yorkshire Pudding was light and fluffy, and the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy. We ordered a few extra sides (no, its not needed.. we were just hungry) of truffle fries and creamed corn.For desserts we had coffee, tea, mudpie, and my free birthday cake slice.They were very thoughtful to sing for me and give me a printed photo as a remembrance.It was worth the price but it is much easier for the heart if you keep a look out for deals or promos.Highly recommended! :
5
It was a nice working day afternoon and we started early, at 1130am. The place was quiet was the staff were friendly and attentive. The food was great as usual and when we commented that the cut of meat looks more cooked than medium rare, the staff were quick to suggest lots of alternatives. As we did not want to waste food, we were not keen to throw away what had been served to us. The manager was quick to serve us a glass of wine each as an apology. However he was really warm and it felt more like a friend buying us a drink than an apology. It was a lovely experience
3
Everything was just average. Even though many other reviewers enjoyed their experience at Lawry's (service etc..) I personally think that the service was overwhelming and scripted. The occasional smiles and checking would have sufficed but they were too over the top. However, I do understand that they were all giving their best (especially the managers in suits). I would neither return for the food nor the service though as there are other restaurants to try out. However, it was an okay one-time experience.
5
Went there for the very first time for dinner. We have our reservation through Chope and it was amazingly helpful. We arrived 20 minutes late from our reservation and thought it has been released and instead they are still keeping it and arrange a nice table by the window over looking Orchard road. Felt the warmth from the hostess, waiters and we feel so welcomed!We both order Black Angus Filet Mignon. I, like usual had my steak Medium. It is amazing! Juicy and very tasty even without having it with the mushroom sauce yet. We also ordered french fries and creamy corn. I love to have all savoury and sweet flavour all together. Creamy corn we ordered goes very well with the juicy fillet mignon. Not to forget they also served the signature salad which mixed in the swirl stainless bowl on top of ice cubes. The highlight is how thoughtful they are providing the also ice cold salad fork! I am just blown away (by the oh-so simple things) Will definitely go back again for more!
3
We were 2 persons looking forward to a high end steak dinner experience and we walked away disappointed. The restaurant has a charming decor and nice enough staff upon arrival. The waitress and her team were prompt and attentive. The problem was that both of our steaks were not cooked to our ordered degree. My T bone was overcooked and bland and my fellow guest ordered medium well and was given medium rare, the chef tried to correct, but it came out dry. There was also a lack of willingness to repair the mistake by offering a drink or to reduce the bill which is normal procedure, so even the recovery was poor. My suggestion is try a different place for Steak or better yet save the steak dinners for New York...
5
The food was great, service was even better. I was there to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday. The staff and the manager, Solihin, was really attentive to our needs. We were also given a slice of complimentary cake and a hard copy photo. The after service was also commendable as they sent the soft copy photos to my email. Would highly recommend this restaurant and I'm very sure I will be back again! :
4
Excellent cuts and expert staff. For me a bit too much "serving" attitude. I especially loved the huge stainless steel steak carts. Quite expensive.
5
It was a nice time out with the Mrs. Enjoyed the food and the atmosphere at Mandarin Gallery was peaceful.
5
The atmosphere was nice, food was wonderful as always, we always thought of Lawry's when we have important occasions
5
The service is super and we are very well taken care and enjoy the great experiential and delicious food.
4
Throughly enjoyed the service which my partner and I received during our visit, pretty pleased with the food and the overall service!
Well done Lawry's!
4
Perfect place for romantic dates and intimate gathering with friends. Food is fantastic while staff are friendly and host is pleasant and all ready to make your day a better one.
5
They recommend food for me and serve me when I needed anything. The food is great and the waiting time is just right
5
Dined at the restaurant for Mother's Day. Amazing dishes with good presentation - really loved the starters, and of course the prime rib was the star. Service was amazing with very friendly staff. Good ambience as it is quiet in the very busy Orchard area. Highly recommended
5
We had heard a lot of great things about Lawry's and what better occasion to try it out than my little sister's birthday! When we got there, the maitre'd was extremely friendly and brought us to our table. The waitresses are all very attentive as well. We ordered the prime rib dinner where you just have to decide how much meat you can handle and it's accompanied by the famous spinning salad, mash and Yorkshire pudding. My sister got the smallest cut - California cut whereas I got the Lawry's cut. When it came, we realised that the English cut (in between the California and Lawry's) may have been a better choice or both of us. We ordered medium rare. The meat came in an interesting looking bbq metal cart and the chef cuts the meat in front of you. Overall the meal was great including the sides.We were greatly surprised when my sister was served a chocolate birthday cake and we also got a 50% birthday treat for the second meal. Thanks Lawry's for the great surprise! Really was a great experienc
4
we were shown in immediately and attending by the waiters who were friendly and very helpful. The steak I must say is marvelous, there is no doubt that you must oreder the Lawry's cut roast and not settle for Sirlion, Porterhouse or anything but the roast. The cut is very generous and tender. The side sare nice but stick to the main. No Oysters though as we saw them make their way directly to the private room, hmm, they should keep some for for people outside 
5
I love how attentive their waitors and waitress are.
They are very flexible and they tried their best to service you. Explaining each dishes to us and the difference. I'm definitely impress with their quality of services.
4
Wonderful meal and decent value. Everything we wanted the experience to be it was- great service and wonderful food, fantastic wine menu and felt as if we had dined here always. Home from home!
5
The service was excellent and the staff seemed to anticipate our needs. Food was always on time and the Lawry's cut was excellent.
4
Roast beef was excellent cook just right. Salad could have been better with spinach. Overall good value for money with Cimb cards
5
Staff was very courteous and friendly. Food was great and very filling. Staff was helpful in applying the most beneficial discounts, which not many other restaurants will do.

Lawry's has been in Singapore since 1999, but its actual history goes back almost eighty years when the first outlet opened in Los Angeles. With that history comes a certain style of old-fashioned hospitality that seems rather timeless. This was evident in the decor of the restaurant with its high ceilings, elegant furniture, and the the warm manner in which staff greet and interact with the diners.My wife and I recently celebrated out wedding anniversary with a long lunch at Lawry's. Being the special occasion that it was, we decided to order whatever we wanted, just to indulge and enjoy ourselves. Starting with a serving of spinning bowl salad (the fun is seeing how it's prepared), we moved on to fresh oysters and lobster tail (yummy). As its name suggests, Lawry's is all about its prime rib, so we had to have that. The cuts come in different sizes, ranging from 130 grams to a whopping 450 grams for folks with a mega-appetite. My wife and I chose a more conservative California cut (160 grams) and English cut (three thin slices, amounting to 200 grams). Mashed potato (with gravy) and Yorkshire pudding were included with the meal, as were sides including cream corn (heavenly), creamed spinach, and buttered peas if one wanted these. I especially liked the whipped horseradish cream which came in two intensities of hotness - these were a wonderful accompaniment to the beef. From start to end, lunch took about two hours but was a very nice change from our usual hectic mid-day meals. While the meal was pretty pricey, and I can't see myself eating here regularly, for the excellent quality of the food and the overall experience that my wife and I enjoyed so much, it was worth every cent and is easily a very special place for future special occasions

I booked online via Chope, specifying that this was a birthday reservation for my wife. Then, I confirmed the birthday reservation via phone call directly to Lawry's on the day of. After we were seated, that's when the series of sloppy service began. We were asked if we wanted flat or sparkling water. We chose flat, thinking that we'd receive normal, free water. This was not the case the waitress brought two bottles of chargeable flat water. We quickly mentioned that we just wanted regular, free water instead of the two bottles. Perhaps my wife and I had misunderstood the term 'flat' water. The waitress walked away with the two bottles, visibly frustrated that the bottles would now be wasted since the caps were already off. Ok. Perhaps we misunderstood the terminology, so we'll let it pass and enjoy our meal. We were left to look at the drink menu for about 5 minutes as no one came to our table to take our drink order. The restaurant was not busy at all. There were multiple waitresses just standing around. Finally, I raised my hand and called someone over. There was no initiative from Lawry's end to explain the birthday wine special or even the birthday entree promotion (buy one, get the 2nd at 50% discount) even though the restaurant should have known by now that this was a birthday reservation. I asked the first staff member who came over what the birthday wine selection was. He had no clue, so called another staff member over to explain the wine. At this point, our original waitress had been servicing other tables so we were assigned another, much more friendly, second waitress (I thought Lawry's policy was to assign one waitress to the same table to avoid these gaps in service time?). My wife and I have been huge fans of Lawry's bread since eating in a few US locations. We asked for more bread and were asked, "How many?" which is a very strange thing to ask. During our meal, we asked for another order of bread (it is quite delicious) and the staff member who took our order politely went to prepare our request. Out of nowhere, the original waitress returned to our table to inform us that Lawry's bread policy is 1 piece per person and that additional pieces are chargeable at $1.50 per piece. We have ordered $100 per person steaks and a bottle of wine, but bread is chargeable at $1.50 per piece?! Is this really your policy at Lawry's Singapore?Please train your staff to provide better service that is consistent with the Lawry's brand. Thank you.

This was our first visit to Lawry's, a de facto fine dining place for Singaporean to celebrate different occasions.My wife and I had dinner at this Singaporean tradition and we had a nice time. Their signature prime rib were done in the old fashion way, tender, succulent, and tasty. It was served by friendly staff dressed in traditional waitress uniform. During the night we had heard birthday songs sung in the special Lawry's tune at almost every second table. By the end of the evening we could sing the song by heart. I guessed most dinners there were expecting that or looking forward to hearing the birthday song. If you're not part of the birthday group one could feel that this could be a bit overdone, but it was a bit of fun for us for our first experience.There are far and between this type of experience, one that still holds onto the old fashion way and provides quality food and services for its partrons

Great w 50% discount on amex card for 2 diners. Service was pleasant. Fork and plate for spinning salad which came w every mains ordered was cold - nice detail. Serving was small though. Ribeye was great. Prime rib was juicy and nice though there were pretty big chunks of fat with the bone. Yorkshire pudding was great too to mop up the jus. Soft crispy, chewy, savoury.
4
This was my first trip to Lawry's and wow, this place is fantastic...All the staff were amazing, super attentive and friendly and the food well it was top drawer.....Went for the "Lawry's" cut prime rib with Yorkshire pudding which was mouth watering and so tender. A must visit if your in Singapore
4
Went here to celebrate my birthday. The service was excellent especially the main host. Throughout the courses, each meal was delicious although oddly the main dish of Lawry's cut prime ribs was my least favourite. Still good, but it wasn't the highlight for me. Odd.
5
Went there for a birthday celebration and we ordered an english cut and a rib eye steak. The tenderness is unexplainable. Best steak i ever had.
Great to have celebration there!
4
The service at Lawrys was impeccable ! Friendly and attentive staff! We went for Diamond Cut and Lawry's cut! Seems like everyone voted for Lawry's cut! The steak was so soft.. Do try it out if you can!
4
Came here for wife's birthday and the service couldn't have been better. Steak was perfectly done up. Will definitely be back for another toss of the salad!
4
The service at Lawry's was excellent and the quality of food is good. The staff are very friendly and helpful.
5
Excellent service. Awesome ambiance. Great food. Definitely one of my top choices for having a celebration.
5
The Food has a superb taste and presentation. The ambiance is conducive for wonderful dining experience. Overall experience is excellent.
5
Excellent experience with the family for a birthday. A consistent favorite. Good service and food as always
5
We were 8 people who had dinner here and no regrets it's worth the trip to Singapore. Lawry's cut prime ribs was my order. Medium well is best compared to medium which is too red for me. Have horse radish on the side. I love horse radish. My wife and daughter ordered lobster tails dinner set. The prime ribs is to die for. Dreaming of it every night.
4
I took 8 guests for dinner at Lawry,s including 2 vegetarians. The staff looked after us very well, explained the food and options for the vegetarians. If you are into steak, Lawry,s is a great option, and I recommend you try their signature Prime Rib, it's delicious!! For those not into steak, there are plenty of other choices.
4
Had dinner at Lawry's The Prime Rib Singapore - food was excellent and place was beautiful. The beef served was also high quality and service was very good. Highly recommended for special occasions to celebrate.
5
Went to lawry's for my boyfriend's birthday and it was splendid. The food was good and the service was excellent. My boyfriend was awed by their extraordinary friendly staffs.
5
The food is great! And the service is excellent! We had the Lawry's cut and lamp stew. We will come back to try out more dishes.
5
Staffs were attentive with smiles, a bargain for a good steak. Will definitely come back again !!!!!
5
The steak was beautifully done. We love the oyster and spinning bowl salad. Best of all they surprised us with a birthday cake. Excellent experience.
5
went there for a surprise birthday celebration, staff were friendly and held our table till the birthday arrived. food was really good though pricey but expected, loved the decor and christmas ambience. would come back again
5
service was excellent and the restaurant had a luxurious feel. food was great although the rib cut could have been better.

Came to Larwy's with 3 of my work colleagues for an evening meal.We really fancied a good steak and we thought we would try here. We went for the prime rib special which came with a salad to start. The salad was mediocre to put it mild even though we were made aware of it been a signature dish.Recently had a salad delivered from a local chain and it knocked socks off this so it didn't start very well.Was hoping that my main would improve but after the salad it couldn't get any worse. The prime rib came with corn, mash potatoes and creamy spinach along with a quarter of Yorkshire pudding and some gravy.The prime rib was the medium in size and it was delicious. One the best that I have ever had on my travels. The meat just melted and lived up to the good reviews.If they fixed the awful signature spinning salad with something a little more appetising then I would have gave them 5 stars for sure
2
The quality of the prime rib is on standard what you would expect for this price and at Lawry's. Unfortunately the management is incompetent, uses their phones openly in the restaurant and therefore also the staff is busy talking to themselves instead of paying attention to customer's requests. For such a restaurant an absolut no go.
4
The steak, salad and potatoes were great. For a restaurant of this calibre, I was unpleasantly surprised that I had to ask for water twice. The first waitress I asked avoided me when I tried to catch her eye again and I had to ask another. The way another waitress spoke wasn't very clear either... she basically mumbled when she introduced the dishes
5
The food was good and the service was even better. There was a birthday promotion where 1 out of 3 main courses ordered was free. The restaurant also gave us a piece of birthday cake and a free photo. Overall, the experience was good.
5
Nice ambience, good beef steak. Love the salad and side dishes. Beef steak with Lawreys sauce is perfect.
5
The service was excellent. Waitress / Waiters were attentive.
The beef served was excellent. The Birthday surprise from the restaurant was unexpected and greatly appreciated.
5
Service was impeccable, attention to detail and gave good recommendations on what to order, size of serving, etc. Went to Lawry's to celebrate a birthday, besides the usual birthday song and some cake, there was even a photograph session with hard and soft copies given.
5
Never fail to impress us. Food and service was excellent. Crew always made sure that we are comfortable and well informed of the food and wine choices on the menu.
4
Fantastic steak, wonderful atmosphere. One can never go wrong for steaks at Lawry's. Service was slightly less attentive than what I expected but friendly.
5
Fantastic Dining Location with Great Food. Would visit again soon!
Recommended for steak lovers!!!!!

Lawry's has always been our favorite place to celebrate the birthday of family members. We usually order their signature dishes (Prime Beef Ribs) that comes with very good salad, excellent prime ribs (order medium or medium rare) and british style bread yolk pudding. They will also provide you with complimentary very nice warm bread and butter as an appetizer. The prime Ribs is very tender and nice, definitely one of the best. Their way of serving salad is also very interesting. Pricing is considered high but the birthday person gets to eat for free if you celebrate it there with minimum 2 other persons, plus they'll give you free nice small birthday cake and photos.
2
The basic premise of this place is 2 things: salad spun in a plastic bowl to mix the dressing in, before serving, and rib roast served in an old-fashioned metal trolley. Standards certainly have dropped over the years. A standard meal consists of these elements:Rib roast = underwhelming compared to other places. Nothing special. It has a herb sauce, which drenches everything on your plate like a soup. A big no-no for steak lovers.Salad: mainly lettuce, with bits of egg and croutons. There is a lot of showmanship with the spinning, the point is to mix the leaves with the dressing. But it doesnt distinguish itself from any supermarket salad.Yorkshire pudding: slightly gimmicky, tastes like omelette over pastry. Nothing great.Drinks or sides of your choice. Sides would either be mash, pears, or spinach, everything too mushy and wet. Add these to your roast to get a soppy mess.Service: quite horrible to be honest. Singapore has been replacing locals with immigrants. Whilst the elder men and women, presumably the last vestiges of the local staff still appear polite and attentive, the younger immigrant staff giggle and chat in the background, and sound rude when attending to you. You will hear 'Are you done?' with a curt tone when they spot an empty plate on your table.The entrance and decor certainly do not match up to the experience. Try only if you do not have other food choices in the area
3
The food quality had to be beyond expectation for the price we paid. We did not feel that it delivered on that. To be fair, we only had the Prime Rib (as the main) and crab cakes. Both of which we've had better elsewhere at a fraction of the cost. Service however was wonderful.
5
We have made Lawry's our preferred venue for any celebration as it never disappoints! Overall great service, great food and great ambience! Will definitely return!
2
The price for food here is astronomical. I only wanted to eat, not buy the restaurant. Who wants to pat $150 for a steak? Yes a nice steak but no different from the $20 steak at other places.
4
We visited for late dinner and service was great, also food, expensive than US branch, location is in Famous Orchard rd, we cancel reservation and then we called again for the table
5
Went there for post valentine's dinner. Service and food was excellent. Great for couples or family whether casual dining or events dining. Will definitely go back.
4
Great and excellent service and ideal place for birthday celebration. Location was good too as it was in orchard and easy to find..
5
I've had roast beef at Lawry's in the U.S. since 30 years ago and everything good about Lawry's has remain unchanged! We continue to love coming back to Lawry's for a great roast beef meal.
4
Lovely staff sang birthday song and presented us with a nice birthday cake, overall nice experience but the dish - fish & chips with tiger prawn is not so ideal
3
I saw the reviews online and expected a nice restaurant with good meat. It was nothing but disappointing! I made a reservation for 19:30 but called to say we will be there at 20:00. The waiters seem to be all from the philippines. We had a drink at the bar area before proceeding to our table. We had a table along the window, but just like any other place in Singapore, the view is of the road... What a lovely view...We had starters, lobster and another dish. For mains, I had a roast beef and my partner had beef steak. His main dish came a lot earlier than mine and mine was no where to be seen. We asked the waitress and she said "The chef has to go to 2 other tables before coming to you"... WHAT GREAT SERVICE. As a fine dining restaurant, food should be served at the same time. The meat was not good and certainly does not live up to its name. The only thing good was the wine.. Many people celebrating their anniversary here

Keeping the worst of the 1970's alive.Ok, if you like uber formality this place is it. I would prefer better food and/or reasonable portion sizes (as in normal man size not US size or pretentious nouveau cuisine size).Its sort of built on some Parisian tradition and then simply gone 'over the top' with sudo American Vaudeville theatre. I would simply like a perfect steak and a nice bowl of mash with some sea salt and a red wine jus, like the Australian's do. The vegetables should be identifiable and have some crunch and possibly some scorched almonds thrown in for interest-but no.The elements of the evening which degraded the meal started with the 'chilled salad fork'! for what was a poor green leaf salad (very American) a slither of a root vegetable for colour (beetroot), no pine-nuts, shaved parmesan cheese, no balsamic dressing here lets just give everyone Thousand Island dressing just like 1976.The dressing of course as you can see from their website was poured from great height like a Spanish wine, for what reason I have no idea, but one must watch as the chilled lettuce is turned on an ice bowl, clapping is advisable. What a load of rubbish for a second rate salad-I left mine.Then a chef pushing a nuclear bomb or an Airstream trailer from the 1950's wears a medal from some great navy battle arrives. I must admit the floor show is good and only the elephants were missing. Unfortunately the prime rib is not my favourite cut of meat (I know its all my fault, I should have ordered the filet mignon), however at $100+ for a steak any cut should be good. Mine was sinew ridden and I understand why the Bowie knife was needed, even though it couldn't handle my piece of poor dead cow. So I eat the puree spinach-it resembles cow poop on the website) or whatever it was. The tablespoon of mash and the puree sweetcorn is whole disproportionate to the acres of steak relaxing on the plate. Some crunch or identifiable vegetable would have been good at this stage. I went in a meat eater and came out a vegan...and a hungry vegan at that.The restaurant offers a free slice of birthday cake, so like everyone else in the restaurant we all had our birthdays that night. I think I listened to seven 'happy birthday's' just at the next table then four more at the other table behind sung by the staff.The $1000 bill for four with two bottles of a promotional Malbec feels like we were gouged. My Yorkshire Mother produced a far superior Sunday lunch for 40 years and would turn in her grave at the prices for a very forgettable dinner. Thank God for good company.On the upside-The staff were nice and working hard on a Saturday night

I went for my son's birthday and we got a buy 2 get 1 free deal. It seemed that most people there were also celebrating birthdays, judging from the number of times I heard the Happy Birthday from Lawry's song.We asked for a quiet table and got one next to the kitchen exit and a noisy private room.We cruise very often and the experience was underwhelming compared to main dining room experiences on cruises. The waitresses wore ridiculous headgear which looked like upside down facemasks. The service was unfortunately American style : overly friendly and attention seeking rather than quick, intuitive and unobtrusive which I what prefer and would be more elegant and suited to fine dining. We started at 8pm and ended the meal at 10 ( after waiting around for the salad show and the beef wagon to arrive) and so they never bothered to ask if we wanted to see the dessert menu.The waitress took our orders without writing anything down, on checking back, she had remembered the rare ribeye we wanted as a medium. We corrected her right away. BUT sure enough the ribeye arrived medium well! They took it away and it did come back medium rare but our other dishes were getting cold and we just accepted it. There was also another issue with the creamed spinach served on my plate rather than a shared dish.Service recovery is better than a most Singapore restaurants but I would prefer it if they did simple things like writing down orders rather than make the mistake and then have to recover from it.I also felt that it was rather condescending to explain to guests what a Yorkshire pudding was and which fork to use before we had even started!!The food:I ordered the prime rib ( California cut) which was quite good and tender and flavourful. It came smothered in a generic salty, gloopy brown sauce with chunky mashed potatoes and a huge yorkshire pudding which looked more like a Dutch baby (pancake) served in a separate small skillet. I have had better ones walking into any random pub in England and paying about half the price.My son and husband ordered the fillet and ribeye. The ribeye was tough and dry - even for medium rare. I cook better steaks at home. The fillet was a nice thick piece, and arrived with a rare centre but medium to well for most of the rest - they obviously don't sous vide their steaks here. It wasn't helped by the meat arriving on empty hot plates with 4 kitschy bent forks holding one single piece of vegetable dangling above it
5
it was meant to be dinner celebrations, the staff gave us a surprise birthday cake with song by the waitresses.
service was good and attentive.
only thing to note... the lawry's cut was huge, good if u r a big eater.
4
Went for Valentine's Day dinner special 5-course dinner. Atmosphere and service was excellent but the main course was not as good as when I went previously and ordered ala carte.
4
Nice place to visit. Very cozy and stylish with good service. The Prime Rib is a must. Very good wine list if you want to spend some money
4
The service of the staffs were exceptional and the ambiance of the restaurant was great!! The roast beef and lobster were excellent though the spinning salad was kinda overrated.
5
Enjoyed the service and ambience, not to mention the wonderful steaks! Spinning salad was good too, my boyfriend love the bread crumbs and it goes well with the black pepper!
Overall, a great place for dinner!
5
Staff v polite. Service at the highest level. My fav bday celebration place. Delights me to get the photo printed on the spot
5
The food was great - tender succulent meat with the perfect side in the yorkshire pudding. Superb service too!
5
Brought my wife to this famous restaurant for lunch.We ordered 2 English cut set.Food is good, portion is just nice.After we finished our lunch, we asked the waitress to take a picture for us.She asked is there special occasion and i told her it's my wife's birthday.Then we ask for the bill.After I paid for the bill and was about to leave, the waitress surprise us with a slice of cake and a birthday song.The lead waitress told us that they give 50% discount on the 2nd main course when we ordered 2 set lunch for birthday. Although I have paid the bill, she ask for my credit card and bill, void the earlier transaction and gave me the 50% on the second set lunch.Wow!This is what I call great service!Two thumbs up Lawry's, we will definitely be back :
3
We went for a late lunch on Valentine's. Order the California and Tradition cuts. Both portions are huge for both my girlfriend and myself. Food is tasty but the mashed potato gravy is a little different. We asked for rare in terms of doneness but I didn't think it was rare enough.View by the window was wonderful
5
Great food and service. Additional table service charge at $15 was totally worth it for couples who wish to share the food (e.g. Lawry's cut, seafood and side dishes). They will separate the food for you equally before serving it to you. Seafood was only acceptable but it is not their core product.
3
We live in Singapore for 10 years.
All good but Prime Ribs far too expensive and not so tender.
Just a brand, can get better in Singapore and far cheaper.
Won't come back!
5
The quality and taste of beef here is always good and stable. Special salad and Yorkshire pudding are also tasty.
5
Service was excellent and the food is great! Brought parents for their birthday celebration, Mom loves the lamb and dad loves the prime steak! There were complimentary birthday cakes too!!! Highly recommended!
3
Was rather underwhelmed by the beef, tender but lacking in flavour but it was a rather good presentation - spinning bowl salad and slicing of beef by the table. Favourite was the Yorkshire pudding, we were rather full hence did not order accompaniments. The serving came with salad, bread roll and mashed potatoes which was more than enough. Upon serving the beef, the waitress would check with you once more if you'd like to add the accompaniments, at this point you could change your mind! The fresh horseradish was a rather nice touch, went well with the beef and constant checking by the waitress if more gravy etc were needed.
1
I think among all Lawrys I been to, the Singapore Lawrys is the worst one. Waitresses were less than professional, manager was actually quite good in handling the feedbac
3
This is meant to be the grand dame of Singapore steakhouse but it has been resting on its laurel. The much hyped spinning salad was nothing special with a large plastic spinning bowl where the vegetables got well mixed with the dressing. The famous Lawry's steak is your average sunday roast. But imagine only one signature dish for this entire restaurant? And the price! It felt really expensive even with the one dine free offer from Amex. There got to be much better steakhouse in Singapore. One reserved for the tourist I'm afraid
4
Me and my family always have had a soft spot for lawry's. nice ambience, great food and great service all thanks to Mr Masu and his team of servers and chefs.I had the English cut medium of the prime rib of beef. Aged and roasted over rock salt to perfect tenderness, I loved sinking my teeth into that richness only coated by the Au jus. Absolutely wonderfully complemented by the mashed potato and Yorkshire pudding, I added spinach for extra flavour. The rest of the family had the fillet mignon also done well, and lobster tail, foie gras and beef bruschetta as starters. While I normally take a glass of wine to go with my beef, I couldn't resist the chocolate milkshake almost as an appetiser and dessert. Lol.Overall, we loved lawry's and being a regular, service is tops
4
Visited the establishment on a nice weekend with 3 friends. Always wanted to try their prime rib and finally got the chance to with a 40% discount voucher that was given to me by my bank. We all had the prime rib dinner. Almost went for the Lawrys Cut (285g) but glad I decided to choose the California Cut (160g) instead because the meal was really filling! The prime rib dinner comes with their famous spinning bowl salad that has cherry tomatoes, croutons and diced egg. The meat is carved in front of you and you get to choose your preferred done-ness. The plate is served with mash potatoes and Yorkshire pudding. I must say the beef was really tender and delicious.The service was excellent. After you're seated, your dedicated waitress will introduce herself and a partner waitress to the table and will introduce each dish as it's being served to you. The ambience of the place is great - dim lightings and tables not too close to each other. They have private rooms as well.
4
Best steak forever that I ever had so far. The texture of the steak was awesome. Besides, also must try their lobster dinner which definitely will bring you another unforgettable dining experience.Overall dining experience was great and served in fine dining style. The salad was freshly made in front of you also.Atmosphere were great generally, price was a bit high but no harm trying if you keen to try different dining experience

It had been many years since I experienced Lawry’s The Prime Rib restaurant, and with a hunger for prime rib, I headed over to their Orchard Road location. The only other location I dined was in Las Vegas. The reception was very friendly and a table was available. I did not have a reservation, and I could see that might be necessary on certain nights.For those that are not beef eaters, they did have a number of seafood and other selections, but I came here for the prime rib. I selected the English cut, which came with the spinning bowl salad and mashed potatoes. The salad was good, although perhaps with a little too much dressing. The mashed potatoes were quite nice, and of course, the prime rib was cut from the silver trolley.The prime rib was good, although not great. I would have liked it a bit rarer and perhaps more seasoning rub on the beef. It also could have been hotter, which is one of the challenges of using the serving trolley. Since I live in Arizona, prime rib is consumed weekly, so I tend to be a little critical. In Arizona, we are very serious in how prime rib is prepared.Overall, I enjoyed my evening. The service was very good and the prices were what you would expect to pay. And, the beer was ice-cold
5
We visited the restaurant for the birthday celebration. We chose the California and English cut. The food is quite nice with unique and warm service. Will visit again in the future.
4
love it like it . i love the corn it taste soooo nice . in the picture its " california cut 160g " i hope they have more smaller cut coz . its still to big for my tummy 😄
5
It was a awesome meal at Lawry's. Celebrated my Girlfriend's birthday , had a complimentary dessert and a photo taken.
4
Thou is pricey, service is good and their beef is excellent! Shall go back to try lobster tail. Spinning salad could be more fresh.
4
Restaurant is ok for dinner but there is too many kids around, crying and talking, kind of noisy environment. Food is above average. Could be improved if restrict younger kids in the restaurant.
5
Christmas Eve dinner was very pleasant the service was first class.
Forgot to order potatoes with the Turkey dinner.
4
Ordered 3 different steaks, including the wagyu. Also had the lobster, salmon and lamb. In general, the food was good. However, we had to wait awhile for the accompanying side dishes.
5
Great restaurant . We decided just to go in as we were hungry and meat was in our mind . They serve excellent roast beaf as well as steaks . They also have some seafood and chicken. I tried the rib eye steak and it was excellent. They have a tradition to provide mixed salad in a fancy way adding to the beauty of the restaurant. Was. It very impressed with the interiors but it was ok . Highly recommended for steak and roast beef

Had the Lawry's prime rib dinner with the California cut. Although the portion was the smallest, it was really too much to finish, partly because of the amount of food and also due to the bland and heavy taste. The beef itself was perfectly done, but the taste gets boring half way because there is gravy on practically everything on your plate, including the mashed potatoes and the Yorkshire pudding, and all you can taste is the gravy. Even the horseradish failed to make things a little bit more interesting. The spinning salad at the beginning was crisp and nice,and the staff are attentive, polite and not overly friendly. If you are into the classic, traditional American gravy-all-over food, this might appeal to you....but beware of which size cut you order, anything over 200g will probably give you heartburn. Maybe ask for less gravy or have it served separately.
4
It was my first visit to Lawry's with friends. It was pricey but the cuts of meat were good. Had the signature cut which was served at the table. Nice drama with things like the spinning salad bowl but it is more gimmick then anything. Service was excellent as you would expect at this price range
5
Good service, good Martini's and excellent steak from the grill. The staff uniforms and showmanship on serving gave the restaurant a unique character. I would recommend for steak in Singapore.
3
The table arrangement was too closed to each other, therefore it seems to be very noisy and difficult to have conversations within my table.
5
I've always celebrated my anniversary at Lawrys and they never fail to make us welcome. I arranged flowers to be sent and they accommodated. Thank you very much!
4
We're return patrons, primarily cos of the central location and reliable food quality. Very nicely drssed up for Christmas. Much more suitable for family meals than couples looking for a romantic meal.
4
Had a great dinner,the food quality is excellent.
Everything was delicious,the only bad thing I can say is that the portions are quite small but I still suggest this restaurant for a top quality dinner and a great steakhouse experience.
5
We're served by your staff Rose, she is professional and I love her service. Me and my wife enjoy ourselves very much.
5
Excellent food and service! Staffs are attentive. Lawry cut is recommended. My girlfriend did not like raw meat and she ordered lobster and its tasted good as well
3
Beef was standard "good" wasn't out of the world but was decent. The lobsters were tad dry and not up to expectations could have been better. The Yorkshire pudding was great with the beef juice. The crab cakes are really good. Wine promo was good and decent wine for the price
4
Juicy, generous portion from the famous Lawry's cut. Menu also comes with good wine pairing. We also ordered lobster tails and oysters as starter. The lobster is overcooked but the oysters are large, fresh and juicy.Corkage charge is $50 which is standard for similar class restaurant. However, should consider lowering it and encourage BYOW as they don't serve wine in canister
4
Excellent restaurant, little bit of a shame that it is set in a shopping mail. The Prime Rib takes center stage here (as it should), I saw very little else being served. The portions are good, you can choose the size of your cut from the menu and change your mind when they come to carve if you feel that you have under (or over) ordered. The service I found a little slow, but the staff were courteous and knowledgeable. I loved the carving trolley, and the chef walking around with it. He seemed to be so proud of what he was doing. I must say that I found it a little over priced even for Singapore, but all in all a very good experience
5
Food is nice and big portion. Reserved window seat. View is nice too. Given a complimentary cake and photo shoot!
4
lawrys prime rib was awesome, food was gd and service was top notch. received a complimetary bday cake and photo
5
This is becoming a tradition — celebrating a birthday meal at Lawry's. Great food, impeccable service, and festive ambience. Looking forward to our next meal there!
5
Celebrated hubby's birthday at Lawry's. They were as usual courteous and accommodating. My 10 yrs old son doesn't eat salad and they kindly exchange for soup. A super plus on birthday, a beautiful photo taken for safekeep.
4
Food and service were fabulous! Best if you are looking for a good cut of steak! Love the salad! They did not have our table ready by reservation time because they were overbooked. However, once inside the restaurant, service was very attentive.
2
Service not good. They give place not comfortable. Taste avarage.... can go but not recommended. Not come again.
4
Great food, nice ambience, friendly service. Thanks to Lawry's for the complimentary birthday cake and photo shot. Look forward to another visit soon!
5
Amazing experience and wonderful place to bring your date here to dine for a special occasion.
Service was tip top, staff were friendly, food was excellent.

Always worth a visit for the prime beef. The service is excellent and you will feel at home. The food need no further comment, hey are all good and well prepared.

We went for the 1 for 1 deal with american express.Server were attentive and lunch was delicious The roasted beef was roasted to perfect pink for a medium rare and the meat was tender.I love their gravy which is a perfect dip with their Yorkshire puddingAs for their spinning bowl salad, wish they can use better lettuce instead of iceberg lettuc

I went there for my birthday.
The services were very nice and it was a memorable experience for my family.
5
Thank you to the serving team of the restaurants to make our first Visit a memorable one. The servers are attentive and the food is good. Love the Yorkshire Pudding!
5
It's not our first visit and Lawry's never fail to satisfy us. Service from the crews was awesome, especially the smile that really brightens our day. Food is definitely sumptuous and my hubby had his stomach filled with e generous serving of e roasted beef!
5
Mr Shiva was excellent to provide my mum a wonderful bday experience. He was helpful and polite. On top of that, food was really good and filling too.
5
Outstanding experience even after many visits to Lawry's, the taste of their signature Prime Rib is simply memorable & always that top quaility is served.
Servers were very attentive & detailed, promptly met request from diner's. Had my coffee too & it's perfection is undeniable.
3
Don't know if it is the chicken nuggets but 2/3 of my kids throw up immediately while walking back home. Manager was contacted.
4
This is the second visit to Lawry's. Attentive service and good food. Too bad we dont have space for dessert. Should have introduced us the dessert menu along with the main course n drink menu too. What a waste.
5
The steaks at lawry's are top class. Great wine list and the foegra was good. The lamb rack and spare ribs are excellent. The restaurant is luxurious and although expensive, one leaves this restaurant surely happy.
5
Lawry's offers an experience, not just good food. From start to end, the service that my friend and I had was amazing. This helped to accentuate the food, which was mouth-watering. Both of us had the Lawry's cut for the prime rib: 285g of magnificence, coupled with mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding (to soak up all that wonderful de jus), a unique spinning bowl salad, and a bread roll. It was just amazing, and although it blew a hole in my wallet, I'm certain i'll be back in a few months to savour it all over again
5
It was our first and superb faboulous experience . Lawry's created an unforgettable surprise to us . I booked the place to celebrate my dear friend birthday . At the bill settlement process , the waitress found out that it was actually a birthday dinner. She then asked if she may offer us to celebrate the birthday with a cake from Lawry's and then there was also another waitress offered us taking our photo and gave us a photo and frame for free. Lawry's provided us an unforgettable birthday experience only with a simple cake and photo. And at very last , they still offer us some birthday discount on the bill ! It was the little thing and kindness that touch hearts ! Thank you , Lawry's !

Prime Rib was decent and service was good. Have not been to this place for years, I remember the salad to be a lot tastier. Still good nonetheless.
5
The staff are courteous and definitely know what they are serving. Like the attentiveness of the staff. Great ambiance and the food is excellence. Especially the Prime Ribs of beef. Its tender and juicy. And the fresh oyster.. you gotta try it!
5
The price may be a little high but i believe it was worth in the quality of food and service in which they provided.
5
Apart from the main course ( Prime Rib and baby back ribs) as the stars, the appetizer Atlantic lobster tail was also yummy and definitely worth the try! Certainly will be going back again for more!
5
Love the hospitality and warmth of the staff. No doubts on the quality of the food u get here. Highlight was credit card promotion and the demonstration for the spinning salad bowl on ice. :)
4
I had fun time but expensive than its quality but its quite okay to have birthday i saw many people sing happy irthday song
3
Went with my family of 5 and 4 of us had the Prime Rib in different cuts, . Service was good and the ambience and setup of the restaurant is great too. However, the area I found a little let down is the Prime Rib itself, maybe I had too high expectations of it, as I have a fair bit of prime ribs both here and overseas. The one I've ordered was the English cut in medium doneness, which is 3 thin slices of the prime rib. It's a pity that you have prime rib sliced so thin that you can't even enjoy it properly. It would be better off to have the English Cut in a single piece (for the same weight) rather than 3 thin slices, in my opinion. Otherwise, the Prime Rib itself is still quite decent. What spoilt it too was, as I've selected the corn (which was nice and my daughter loved it too) to go along with it, which was cooked in a creamy sauce, was served on the same plate. The sauce for the Prime Rib is nice, but not when it was subsequently mixed with the sauce from the corn. It just spoils the taste of it all. Guess they should have served the corn on a separate small bowl. Finally, I had really good Yorkshire Pudding from elsewhere before and theirs is a little too tough/hard for my liking. Maybe the taste of it is an area to work on too. Also, I would like it more if they made small Yorkshire Puddings for individuals rather than a big one cut into quarters for 4 people. So on a whole, the place was great but the food just fell a little short of expectations and didn't measure up to it, for me at least :
5
Great place for birthday as the Lawrys team will make you the real special guests! Complimentary photo plus cake ! And also an outstanding service given for each course! Food wise can be improved on how the cut of the steak comes on a plate as my bf Diamond steak was served with a huge bond which makes eating difficult and messy and also lots of fats! In any case would look forward to coming by again
5
Full of surprises!! It's my dear daughter's birthday . We came to Orchard Hotel to check out a few restaurants. The birthday girl picked the Lawry's. Not only the food was excellent, the Lawry's has special Birthday promo!! We had a complimentary choco cake and an instant photo taken. Seconds later, a happy family photo with frame was presented to us. will definitely come back again. Thanks Rose who has been taking care of us during our dining.

We had lunch at Lawry's to celebrate our weddings anniversary. We chose Lawry's because it was having a 1-for-1 promotion which was worth it. As it was a weekday, there were not many patrons. We ordered the set lunch which came with bread, salad, Yorkshire pudding and 3 thin slices of steak (200g) costing SGD$86 per set. Food was very good. Nice ambiance and good service.We booked the table through Chope which was very convenient and efficient.Car park at the Mandarin Hotel is claimable (first 2 hours) by showing the receipt at the Mandarin Gallery concierge
4
We had a very pleasant meal by the window with a good view of Orchard Road. Parking is convenient - parking at Mandarin Gallery Mandarin Orchard Singapore is free for 2 hours with validation at concierge by showing the dining receipt.
4
Had a table by the window seeing orchard road and activity was lively, ordered prime rib and my daughter had lamb chops we had mashed potatoes on the side. Pricey but unforgettable
5
Service was great, food was good! Staff help us to take a photo and printed out to given to us as a gift. Thank you!
4
Svc is very good, nice ambience. Although I rated the food as average (cos I order the wrong kind of beef), overall the food is good.
5
Celebrated my brother's birthday. Everyone had fun. Many options for kids meal. This is unique as usually restaurants have only standard menu for kids.
4
this is the third time i go to Lawrys prime rib,but the standard seems drop compare to last year,still space for improvement
5
Wanted to try lawry's, went in for a very early dinner (or late lunch) around 3pm Ordered the smallest cut of their prime rib and a beer, there are very few people in the restaurant when I visited. The place is very nice. the service was great, food good, price good, no complaints. It's one of those restaurants that you will be happy to pay for good quality service and food. It's a feel good restaurant
5
It is yet another dinner celebration at Lawry's, this for our daughter's 21st birthday. As usual, the Prime Ribs, fresh oysters, shrimp cocktails and the special Lawry's salad were mouthwateringly savory and the service personal and warm. We look forward to our next celebration at Lawry's!
3
This is my 2nd time visited this restaurants in Singapore - it's priceyHad the beef with Mash and Sweet Corn. Beef was tender and succulent. Service was very good and staff were very attentive. Fantastic experience.on the minus side:before order the lobster tails and crab cake was been told that the Amex discount voucher of 40% can be used, but when making payment, the bill did not show that discount given, a bit disappointed.
5
I love the ambience and the food served at Lawry's. The service is always superb by far. I was celebrating my birthday during this visit. They gave you free slice cake and photo memorabilia to bring home. I just wish the famous spinning bowl salad will be altered into slightly healthier option. as it too much of the thousand island dressing and only lettuce as greens. Other than that all was grea
4
The waiting took some time. Otherwise,it was a great dining experience.
Yorkshire pudding was always my favorite.
4
Excellent service and reasonable price based on AMEX @ 50%. I had the English cut and with extra gravy it was a perfect Sunday Roast. My wife had lobster tails which were lovely but slightly small.
5
Our waitress was excellent! always attentive and very friendly! make us feel absolutely welcome! Food was great too!
5
Lawry's never disappoints when one has a meat craving. Even the salad satisfies the meat-eater and primes one doe the roast and Yorkshire Piudding that follows.
Only drawback, there almost never ever is space for dessert after the roast meal!
5
Great atmosphere for the special occasion. My wife and I have been to the Lawry's twice and were impressed on both occasions. The rib was cooked to perfection! Beware of the portion though, the Lawry's cut is generous. A bit on the pricey side but the food and service are worth it. The staffs were attentive and sincere. Reservation is highly recommended especially on weekends. Ask for a table by the window and it will be perfect!
5
I had lunch with my family. The service was friendly and attentive. We ordered 2 English Cut prime rib sets and shared it among 3 of us. It came with salad, mashed potato and yorkshire pudding. The meat was tender and juicy. We also ordered 1 mushroom soup. For dessert, we shared the mud pie. It was an expensive lunch by local standards but the ongoing lunch promotions helped to reduce the bill - we made use of the 1 for 1 lunch promotion. So it helps to check with the restaurant for current promotions
3
It's been more than a few years since the last visit to the restaurant and I've never been to the new location since it moved. Swanky new digs for sure but food was not up to expectations with the pricing on the menu. I would say that more attention is given to the food presentation rather than the quality itself. Salads are done in front of you in a spinning bowl on ice. Novel the first time around but obviously doesn't add anything to the taste. Steaks are also cut in front of you from a large trolley but it wasn't positioned in a way were it was clear what the "chef" was doing.In short, would I go back again? Answer would be a resounding no especially at the rates they charge
3
After a 7 year hiatus, I was looking forward to dining at Lawry's again. I had pretty good memory of the old Lawry's at Paragon.We came during lunch on a weekday. The outlet at Mandarin Gallery is much better lit than the previous outlet. There is natural light streaming in from the ceiling-to-floor glass panels. Seating is comfortable and posh.Service staff is attentive and mostly foreigners. Many are newbies so I feel that their genuineness is rather forced. Can't fault them for anything because they are quite nice overall.The spinning salad is amusing to watch but on hindsight, just a simple way of spinning a metal bowl on top of a bed of ice while dousing the salad dressing.The ala-carte, though, were not particularly impressive. I had the "Singapore cut" (130g of steak) at $68 which comes with salad, mashed potatoes, yorkshire pudding and coffee/tea. My husband had the "Truffle Rosemary Crusted Lamb" at $66 which comes with salad and coffee/tea. Steak was brought to the table with a moving trolley and the Chef who lacks charisma came personally too. Funny thing is while cutting the steak, all I could see was the butt of the chef. Whatever was displayed or executed on the trolley was invisible to me. So much for enjoying the experience!The steak was tender but that's about all I can say. Taste wise, not the slightest-bit impressed. Presentation-wise, totally lacklustre. The rosemary lamb was quite over-done and not too tender. Sad to say, we both didn't think much about the lamb. Frankly, think that I could make it taste better at home, which doesn't help if I think about the $66 I paid for this dish. Coffee is strong but not barista standard. Average brewed coffee.Thank goodness for the 1-for-1 UOB promotion that brought the price down sub $100 for 2 of us. Next time, I will opt for "Fat Cow" instead. More expensive at Fat Cow but there's ommmppphh
2
Food is average, beef lack depth taste you'd get from wagyu. Salad spin gimmicky. Only saving grace - good service. But that's about i
4
Had my birthday celebration with my family at Lawry's. It was our first time trying at this restaurant. Service was great and our server Rose is a very jovial lady.We ordered the lobster starter on promotion. For main, we had Singapore steak which is not too big portion. Food overall is great and the salad spinning bowl was fresh.For birthday celebration they have a complimentary cake with polariod picture taken.Will be back again
5
The steak was fabulous and yummy the portion was little too much so didn't manage to finish it... Overall love love love
5
Thank you Lawry's for the wonderful dinner and excellent service. The beef dishes are excellent and we even have complimentary birthday cake as well.
4
I decided to go to Lawry's with my wife for dinner instead of heading out to Morton's. The "new" premises at Mandarin Gallery is cosy and the service was certainly above average. The steak was fine, but they have actually served me better steaks in the past. At the end of the meal, I didn't get the "chocolate pralines treat" as in the past. Has Lawry's done away with topping-up their delightful dinners with chocolate pralines. If this is the case, then it's quite a sad development
4
Went here to have a client meeting for dinner, felt like they were lacking servers as it took them 2x before we got our order taken. I got the Lawry's cut which by its sheer size can be shared by 2. I ordered medium, but I think it turned out a bit like medium rare. So if you dont like pinks in your meat, go for medium well. The cut was the perfect balance of meat and fat. Food was good, but the service was a bit of a letdown
5
I was looking for a family-friendly restaurant to celebrate my partner's birthday together with my kids. Lawry's the right place to go to for great F&B for the entire family. 4 different cuts to suit the adult's appetite and a variety of choices for the kids' sets as well. Thoroughly enjoyed my dinner and would love to make this a biannually thing
3
Waiting time for the food to arrive was too long. We had to ask the server twice where's our food before it was finally served. We waited almost half an hour for our food. The server will come asking you if you want still or sparkling water. At this moment if you order still water, then they will serve you overpriced Fiji water for $7 each. My advice is tell them you want iced water. Well, the tap water in Singapore is drinkable water anyway, why waste money to buy overpriced distilled water? CIMB Bank card holders enjoy 50% off 2nd main course, so my bill total is a little less than $150 for 2 diners.
4
One of those restaurants that I had forgotten about, with so many constantly changing choices in Singapore it was very nice to go back to a restaurant which does things the old fashioned way.No gimmicks, no fancy plating....Just a big chunk of prime roast beef, great mash potatoes and a huge Yorkshire pudding....sometimes the simplest way is the best.Not the most wallet friendly place for lunch but one that will leave your belly full and very satisfied..!
5
We have been at least 6 times now and this is the most consistent restaurant in Singapore in terms of food quality and service. Mr Shivakumar and his team excelled in our visit today and as usual, we had an amazing meal with endless Yorkshire puddings and lashings of gravy!
4
Beef is good and portion is enough for me as I ordered the 160g (smallest is 130g), just nice for myself. I like their spinning cold salad and their dressing is really good because I tend to request for separate dressing for my salads but I didn't regret this time
1
Cocktail: Old Fashioned.. Not good at all, tasted like bitters with a bit of bourbon splashed in and way too much ice (very limited list of spirits too)Salad: limp, cheap cut iceberg.. Like salad from a bag with supermarket croutons tossed in dressing could have been bottled French dressing for all we knowSteak: chewy and tasteless and swimming in way too much jus Oysters were ok Huge waste of (a lot) of mone
4
Beside Prime Rib, we ordered Crusted Lamb and White Cod & Scallop which are equally good. Great service too.
4
Staff are very well spoken, may be can slow down slightly. Overall experience is not too bad. i will come back next time.
5
Lovely steak snd lobsters. Mushroom soup tasty and the best yorkshire pudding here. With amex card at 50% off it is really a great deal.
5
We had one of the best steaks in Singapore. Go for the filet mignon...nice and tendor and mouth watering....we will be back again.
5
This restaurant is a great experience with excellent food. The special table side service is unique with the customer seeing the meat being cut and salads mixed at table side. Really nice experience, great service and really high quality meat dishes
5
We visited Lawry's on a weekday night, the place was quite full for a Thursday. Had made reservations earlier via Chope so didn't have to wait. We were there to celebrate my mother's birthday, the staff surprised her with a complimentary birthday cake and a photo frame (photo taken on the spot).Food wise - I had the California cut, the smallest cut but I find it to be very filling if you have starters. Beef is tender and very good!Love my dining experience and would definitely go back again
5
This restaurant is very handy to the Mandarin Orchard where I often stay. I have never booked but always managed to get a table (usually because I'm pretty early). The service is always efficient and very friendly, the spinning salads are very nice and the steak cooked perfectly. Presentation is also very good and it's a wonderful dining experience
5
went lawry's to celebrate my husband birthday. food is good and service is excellent!! all the staffs are so friendly and smiley especially miss yaya. keeping my daughter entertained all the time. thanks for wonder experience. will be back again :
4
Ate here at the beginning of the month.The steak was excellent as was the service – I also very much liked the overall ambience.The bill was absolutely huge and I have to say, I’ve eaten at many expensive steak houses and this tops the lot
5
Dont ask about the meat, absolutely delicious..... The pure with brown sauce (i dont know the name of the sauce) as you can see at the picture, maybe one of the best pure i ever had.... but not only that, casually i hate spinach, but this one, i have to admit, i like it.... The only problem is about the price (dont know in US), its quite expensive, but compare to the taste, believe me, its worth it...
4
Excellent meal. Wonderful location-- good/attentive service-- for a price! But overall a good experience for a superlative prime rib.
5
Fantastic food, fantastic service. But do make reservations before you show up to avoid disappointment. However, there are many great restaurants in Mandarin Galleria.
5
Been some years since I stopped at Lawrys. Miserable morning having some treatment at the hospital nearby so decided to indulge.Arrived at 11.30am. Nice and cool - just the right air conditioning for Singapore. Settled at a window table overlooking Orchard Road. No hurry to order - nice relaxed seating with perfectly attentive waitresses.Chose the California rib - set lunch with soup, salad and tiramisu dessert. Soup was a choice of mushroom or ministroni. Chose the mushroom - nice and creamy. Next came the salad - ceremoniously tossed in front of us. Very nice.The main event, the rib arrived in the big trolley and is carved at the table. With potato and Yorkshire pudding as accompaniment. Opted for medium - served just to my liking.Dessert and coffee to finish. Perfect lunch - no complaints on any part of the lunch which I thoroughly enjoyed. Hope to be back soon. Great dining experience. Allow an extra few minutes to find the restaurant as its hidden on the fourth floor, and do make a reservation, especially for dinner they tell me
5
This was an amazing restaurant with very delicious food. I eat the best desert so far there. The name of this desert was "Lawry's Secret Garden" and I found a new and interesting flavor for me. Yummy, yummy! :-)Perfect service, nice enviroment, friendly staff. I higly recommend
5
A luxurious ambience greets us along with cheerful smiles as my family enters the restaurant and we were promptly served to our table. As we have family members that couldn't eat beef, the server took no hesitation to explain their menu to suit our diet - lamb shank and white cod. The chef was also kind enough to de-bone the lamb shank for my grandmother at our request. The rest of us had the signature roasted prime rib and it was carved right in front of us by the chef on their signature silver wagon.The beef was served to the medium-well doneness of my liking, and it exceeded all expectations in taste and texture. In addition, it was served with a spinning bowl salad, which was served on chilled plates and forks, topped with a house-special sauce that gave it a unique flavour. The servers also celebrated my sister's birthday with a complementary chocolate cake, and went the extra mile by printing a family photo, encased with an intricately designed photo holder.We ended our meal with 2 fantastic desserts: a mudpie and a Crêpe Suzette. The Crêpe Suzette was prepared table-side, the flame-boyant cooking stint resulted in an orange caramel sauce that provided a savoury zest to the Crêpe. On the other hand, the mudpie wowed my family with its lingering fragrance as it melts in our mouths.Highly recommended, and will return despite its high cost
5
I was in Singapore & checking out restaurants online & came across Lawrys. Since Roast Beef is the specialty of the house, I took the plunge and made a reservation. Upon arrival I was warmly greeted and my servers name was Hannah.I ordered the Lawrys Cut, and each dinner includes the spinning salad bowl, prime rib, mashed potatoes as well,as Yorkshire pudding.The salad was prepared table side and served with a chilled fork. The salad was fresh and very tasty. For the main course my beef was carved table side and it was huge. I ordered it medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. The sides I had were peas & cream corn- both were also excellent. The beef was amazing and just as I like it. For dessert I just had room enough for ice cream.The service provided by Hannah was performed in a timely and attentive manner. I give very high marks to her and all the staff at Lawrys Singapore. I highly recommend this place for any occasion
3
Sourced this restaurant on TripAdvisor and duly visited.The atmosphere is very pleasant and the staff very polite and attentive. The staff dress theme is I guess based on "Olde World" theme for some of the junior wait staff but to me they appeared dressed as "slaves". Either there is a theme and and participate or you keep dress traditional restaurant style.Ordered soup of the day which was excellent....could have ordered more.On the rexommendation of the waitress I ordered the English Cut steak. Without checking the menu properly I opted for this based on the recommendation. Essentially it is bears a resemblance to an English roast dinner - roast beef, gravy, Yorkshire pudding and mash potato. I hate gravy but that aside, the gravy beef and lumpy mash potatoes were cold. The only item not cold was the side dish of broccoli I ordered.To be fair to the restaurant - they offered an alternative or to remove the meal from the bill.This said, the experience has probably put me off returning
5
My family and I recently ate here. We had a wide variety of food - prime ribs, steak, white cod fish and lobster tails.All the proteins were cooked to perfection. Both the flavours and texture were on point. We enjoyed the freshness of the the meat and seafood. We were also impressed with the side dishes like the Idaho mashed potatoes and Yorkshire pudding.We tried various desserts - mud pie, creme brûlée and pecan brownie. It was hard to choose a favourite as they were all so moreish and of very good quality.The wait staff were attentive, prompt and responsive. They were very accommodating to our requests and needs. We also enjoyed the beautiful decor and ambience of the restaurant. Both the service and ambience quality enhanced our dining experience
4
We had the classic Lawry's Cut. Portion was big and the meat was juicy and tender. The taste was rich yet not overwhelming, the last piece was still tantalising.The preparation of the salad using a spinning bowl of ice was kind of entertaining.Try to get a window seat for a nicer view. And if possible, get the Amex Platinum card for amazing 50% discount
3
Had dinner today and don't think will do a revisit. Steak was good but I have had as good a cut elsewhere for half the price. Also was disappointed as they overcharged (one main course was supposed to be complementary as part of birthday promo) and luckily one of us spotted the error before leaving and bill was void and a new charge bill created. Found their reason lame 
5
Had the English Cut with Mash, Buttered Peas and Sweet Corn. Beef was tender and succulent. Service was very good and staff were very attentive. Fantastic experience, will definitely return.
4
This is a very stylish steak place. Pricey but everything we ordered tasted great from the wine to the side dishes to the steak and the dessert. Loved it!
5
Had a good time with my family this evening to celebrate a birthday! Food was generally good though the fish was a bit off today. When Imran knew about it, he made it up to us which was a great gesture.
5
I've eaten at this location several times and have never once left hungry or disappointed. The beef is so perfectly tender and juicy and always served the doneness I ask for. I could drink that beef au jus from a glass it's so tasty. Atmosphere is lovely, staff so friendly and attentive (Ms. Rose was my waitress most recently - such a pleasant lady) and were happy to give me some brief history of the company which just made the experience that much more unique. One of my meals was for my birthday and they were sure to make me feel like royalty. I look forward to going back
5
Dined here last week while visiting Singapore. The whole meal was top notch - mashed potatoes, salad, and Yorkshire pudding with the oh so tender, cooked to perfection prime rib!! The salad was served in a spinning bowl over ice and extra au jus provided were great touches! Mr. Moussa gave us a brief history of the restaurant and described to us the meal before we got it, which we found quite interesting and unique! Mouthwatering food, great service, and a true start-to-end dinning experience! Highly recommend, we will be dreaming of that prime rib until we come back!
5
I ate here a few nights ago with family that I don't often get to spend time with. Our dining experience was one we will certainly always remember! The service and food were both impeccable. The prime rib was obviously the star of the night, but the spin salad, Yorkshire pudding and gravy were also absolutely delicious. I would not hesitate to return here or to one of Lawry's other locations.
4
We were just looking for a good place to have dinner and felt like ribs. We paid $300 for 2 drinks and ribs with mashed potatoes. I think it is too pricey and there wasn't anything special about the ribs or service. Maybe our expectations were higher looking at the prices. Overall it was good but if I go back to Singapore I don't think this would the place number one to go back. But thank you the staff and chefs for the good experience
5
Had dinner there some nights ago. I am gonna cut to the chase and focus on the main course. The chef brought round this huge trolley to our table and sliced off whatever we ordered from the ribs and served the food on the spot. My father and I shared the 200g English cut, done medium rare, and it was heavenly!The main course came with a salad and a Yorkshire Pudding. The most interesting thing about the salad was the way it was served. Instead of tossing, the waitress spun the salad bowl. Appropriately enough, the restaurant called it the spinning salad.The Yorkshire Pudding was a new one on me. The meat came with a fair amount of juice and gravy. Dipping the pudding was a rather delicious way to consume the liquid
1
Went there for dinner on 4/6 for my husband's bday. We had a nice table by the window, (manager) was kind n offered me a shawl as I was cold. My salmon was bleh. My husband had the oysters and lawry's cut. He was up all night with stomach cramps n diarrhea. Never going back
5
I remember the time I was first introduced to a fine dining restaurant in Los Angeles where we had to wear decent clothings and no sandals allowed. It was an experience for a school boy not to forget.When I returned to Lawry's year after year and I am so glad that it presents in Singapore that I don't have to waste 20 hour flight to enjoy the food, I really mean I cherish it.The ribs taste as excellent as they have always been. The salad is definitely not to miss. The creamed spinach and corn enrich the set with their savoury and sweetness.There may be a lot of writings on Lawry's, but I just want to say that it is one of the restaurants you need to try before you die
4
Visited this establishment recently and must say the service standards have not changed since my first visit 15 years back. It was just as good with much attention to detail. I ordered the English cut which was 200 grams of 3 slices. The beef was medium as requested and was moist and red as it should be with just the right amount of jus on the plate. The waiting staff even brought us more jus when they noticed our plates getting dry. The ambience of the restaurant is fantastic and they even surprised us with a cake at the end of the meal since reservations were under wedding anniversary. Definitely a visit for a good experience but not for the budget conscious.
4
I recently had dinner at Lawry's in Singapore with a workmate. The restaurant environment was wonderful and the service was very attentive. We both ordered the Prime Rib meal which came with everything you could possibly want including prime rib, salad, yorkshire pudding and mashed potatoes. The dinner overall was good, the prime rib was good quality and well cooked. While the sides were good it was a bit bland but overall not bad. As compared to other prime rib restaurants I have been it was good but not over the top. Still, would recommend for Singapore for the experience, food and service
4
The prime rib is excellent, tender and juicy and you can get the cut that you like off the cart. Being used to the normal slab when you order prime rib in the US, the thin slices (English or California cut) that Lawry's serves will surely disappoint for the price. Enjoyed the salad, which is fresh and nicely chilled. Service is top notch
5
Lawry's is an amazing place to take your family or partner out for fine dining and possibly to celebrate a special occasion (like your birthday... Which entitles you to discounts + a beautiful instant print picture)The atmosphere is relatively nice and the food is wonderful.Furthermore, the bright atmosphere is greeted with the warm smiles of the staff who are very professional when handling your orders and whatever you need.Aside from that, 2 free appetizers would be given. Lawry's own home made bread that tastes awesome and their ice bowl salad. A fun fact about the Ice bowl Salad is that they have cooled forks prepared for each individual. The reason for the cooled forks is to ensure the coolness in the salad remains as Long as possible (for better taste).Highly recommend. However, it can be alittle pricey. The most expensive meal would be the New York strip which cost about $160? Other than that, the other meals range from $50-80 if I'm not wrong.

We had a great celebration for a 50th birthday on 28 March 2016. Mr Musa Bukhon took the effort to accommodate to our requirement and we had an enjoyable evening. When service is provided from the heart, the guest can definitely feel it; well done Musa.The overall service has improved a great deal from our last visit some 2 years back. We will be back soon

Booked a table at Lawry's to celebrate partner's birthday. Received text reminder a day before. Arrived around an hour earlier than reserved time, but was shown to table immediately. I do wish the tables are spaced further apart, to give everyone more privacy and not hear the other table's conversation. Spinning bowl salad was a nice touch. Server's red wine recommendation was spot on. Another server's declaration that the Yorkshire pudding goes well with the beef sauce was indeed true, much to our delight! Dessert was good. No complaints. Many tables, like us, were here for birthday celebration and they made sure everyone had birthday song, slice of cake and photo taken. We were asked twice (at least) if everything was ok. Would go again for special occasions, just to have the wonderful beef and service again.

Had a great dinner there couple months ago. The meat was excellent, the dessert was good but the service was slow. A bit too pricey but it's worth a visit once in a while

I was thinking this one through, firstly the food was of high quality, well presented, with attentive staff, so why the three stars.Firstly from when we sat down till after we had finished our main course was under 40 minutes, just way too quick for a restaurant in this price point. I had only just got into my second glass of red.Secondly the price, I would pay that price for full degustation in a quality restaurant. I really felt nearly $10 for an addition of creamed corn to one plate when we were already paying so much for the meal, was blatant high margin up selling at serving time, just not the thing to do in this price point.So my advice, slow down the meal and make it an experience not a race, and if it's on the prime rib trolley it should be included in the meal price. Then it would be a 5 star experience
4
We went as a party of four for a lovely dinner and it was what we got. There was soft jazz music playing in the background. The restaurant was spacious and lit in warm light. All four of us ordered the California cut which was 160 grams in weight. It was served together with bread, salad and corn. We also had crab cakes which were pretty good. The prime rib cuts were very tender and tasty. Great place for gatherings and romantic dates

We went to this restaurant today for late lunch after successful completion of our project.I am surprised that service is still as good as before. (I went there in early 2000s when it was at Paragon)We decided on set meal, ( roast beef ,with soup/ salad, coffee or tea, and dessert)The wait staff come in, and prepare salad in front of us ,and serve some of us salad.Then staff in chef uniform greeted us after we finished appetisers.He cut roast beef according to size . (Ladies chose Singapore cut, while both of us men choose California cut.)Roast beef meal consist of beef, Yorkshire Pudding, and mashed potatoes.We finish our meal and wait for dessert and beverage.Wait staff came with a trolley, with few tea pots and desserts (small pastries only).When we finished our meals and ready to go, the manager came and ask us whether we enjoyed our meal. We replied positively.

Great big piece of prime beef and carved from a very quaint cart which tables several types of cooked beef from rare to medium, etc. Good red house wine. Great service.

It was not our first time at Lawry's, and I must say that the service has only gotten better each time! The spinning bowl salad was delicious, and were were very impressed that they provided a chilled fork to enjoy it with! (There was no such fork previously). The special 'Prosperity Menu' was also very well done - I enjoyed the salad's dressing very much! Even though the food took some time to arrive, the wonderful flavor made up for it all. We were thrilled with the excellent service and food standards! Great dinner that night
5
Our first time in Lawry's Singapore but not our first time at Lawry's. We've tried Lawry's in Las Vegas before. As usual, this place does not dissapoint us with the excellent prime rib! I made my reservation on line but when we arrived, they could not find my name. It was okay though since the Manager came and said they would give us a table anyway. We arrived at 6:30pm and the place was jampacked by 7:30pm! The staff, specially the Filipino who served us was very nice and accommodating. I would definitely recommend this place any time
4
Went to Lawry's for Valentine's Day dinner with wife and kids. Food was fantastic as expected even for the kids' festive set (the meat was done perfectly).Restaurant was not quite prepared for the 1st sitting as we have to wait for around 10 minutes for our bread to be serve while we noticed that other tables have been served. The table was missing some cutlery which I have to remind the waiter on. This is fine if I was dining at a restaurant like Swensons or Sizzler but I expect much more from a place like Lawry's
4
Paid my first ever visit to Lawry's after finding out that they were on the Amex (Singapore) Palate scheme for 2016, which would allow for a 50% discount for two persons, with a minimum of two main courses ordered. We ordered 2 x The Lawry's Cut (@$108 each full price), with a side of creamed spinach (@$8 each full price). The generous portions given looked in excess of the suggested 285g serving size (wow!), but I am not sure because they were not exactly measured. Medium rare came out a bit on the rarer side, but marginally only. Overall good quality.With the 50% discount, I felt the meal was excellent value. Would probably not have gone otherwise, as list price would be a bit too pricey (for me). Good addition to the Palate stable
4
Food and drinks are great but service - although staff is very nice and responsive - lacks international standards
5
First time here since it shifted from paragon. Great ambience. Ask for window seat if possible. Excellent service from staff. The prime rib needs no elaboration 
3
Went to lawry's with husband n two other ex-colleague's, nice ambience, great for family , friends and also couples.It was during Christmas so i must say that it was quite a full house.I can't exactly remember what everyone ordered but i would give the food 7/10Other than that all is good..

Currently doing promotions with several locally issued credit cardsPrime rib dinner at 1-for-1 is good value, with salad and steakAbout $100 per head with the 1-for-1Polite service from mainly Filipino crew who are much better than the average local server though slightly deficient in knowledge of the foodSuitable for intimate first/second dates and small family gathering
5
Don't forget to dress up a but when you dine here. Although they would take you dressed as is. Easy to find on the second floor. Friendly staff, beautiful restaurant decor.
2
Lawry's is a place that tries to be upper class, but fails to achieve just that.
They will start you off with a salad served in a fancy way, but it tastes awful. The overpriced steak tastes okay, nothing more.
5
Came here for my birthday and got surprised with a birthday cake! But what I really remember is the excellent service and huge portions of steak here! Great stuff
5
I've visited Lawry's twice already (once a lunch and second time was Sunday brunch) and every time is still so refreshing. The service is excellent and very attentive. Every course is served to us with care and respect to the food. I felt the attendants' love for gourmet through their service! Food quality is really tiptop and fresh. The typical courses in a set-meal would be: 1. Spinning-bowl salad (mixed on the spot before your eyes) 2. Soup and toast 3. Main entrée (steak cuts MUST be paired with the whipped cream horse-radish)4. Yorkshire pudding 5. Dessert (sometimes fruits and sorbet served in a wine-glass)6. Coffee/tea When I went on my birthday, I was also served a complimentary slice of cake and with 2 of the attendants singing a birthday song to me! Followed by a complimentary photoshot. I felt like a princess :p Wonderful and memorable experience
3
Sometimes less is more. Speaking from a customer point of view, we appreciate taste over complexity.. Case in point, creme brulee was fantastic, but was ruined by the overly sour berries. Likewise for the overly sour strawberry trifile. Finger sandwich was tasteless..As for the rest like the shrimp croissant, chicken bruschetta, chocolate parfait etc were tasty.Service was over done, too many interruptions, should wait for dishes to accumulate before interrupting the table several times. Felt quite harasse
4
Consistently provide one of the best prime ribs in the city. Food quality is very good and the service is always good
5
We were visiting Singapore from Manila and decided to try Lawrys as a last minute thing. It was the best restaurant experience I have had in quite some time. The food, service, and overall experience was superb. It is a fine dining restaurant and we would not normally take a 2 yr old, but it was vacation. They were so good to here, and the children's menu was the best I have ever seen.I really can't express how happy I was with this restaurant
4
We've always been a loyal patron of Lawry's. We spent christmas 2015 in singapore and decided to have our christmas dinner there because of the set menu which included a choice of a lobster tail "tree" and salmon or prime rib. When the lobster tail came out, it wasn't what we were expecting. It seemed more like a garnish than a main course. We spoke to Imran Shahid, the operations manager and complained. He quickly addressed the situation and replaced the "lobster tail" with the prime rib. There will always be hiccups in the F&B business. It's how these hiccups are addressed that matter to me and Imran did a pretty good job. Prime rib was on point as always. We will continue to dine here because of how the manager did his job well

2nd time at Lawry's The Prime Rib, located conveniently in Orchard, Mandarin Gallery. This time I came with my husband for our anniversary dinner, and because it near Christmas, the restaurant is decorated with Christmas songs at the background really adds up to the xmas atmosphere! (First time was with my girlfriends and I just can't stop thinking of Lawry's since!!) I think for women, the English cut of 200g is enough - especially if you want to enjoy the starters, which I think is lovely! the foie gras is perfectly seared, and my hubby who have the crab cakes which is full of crab meat. ( I had the festive cut of 220g the first time, I was so full even w/o starters)! We also have sautéed garlic mushroom and Brussels sprout. Full of flavor and we finished it all up. My husband had the Lawry's cut which is a whopping 285g. Each prime rib dinners include the spinning bowl salad which really is nice watching the staff performing the spinning, soft mashed potatoes which did not turn hard even after some time, and a Yorkshire Pudding - big sized for two too, goes so well with the sauce! The staff are wonderful, even before you enter, they will welcome, greet and introduce you to the restaurant and menu available. We made reservations and they promptly show us our seats. Do make a reservation to have a nice table by the window, I saw there are also other sections of the restaurant for families or larger groups. It could be quite packed and may get a bit noisy, but I actually enjoyed the coziness. Thank you to ALL the wonderful staffs who also greet diners with a smile, from telling you small details of eating your bread warm, introducing the two types of horseradish sauce, and telling you what will be going on next so it keeps the excitement for your dinner going! And of course, finally, the chef will arrive with the silver cart to cut our steak. My 3 pieces of English cut is neatly cut and placed aesthetically pleasing with potato and buttered peas (you can choose other sides such as corn, spinach, onion..etc) on the big warm plate. The pace of our food came just right for us. Thank you for noticing! ;)Very kind of Lawry's to ask if there are any special occasion as we didn't inform them during the reservation. We received a complimentary slice of rich chocolate cake and a photo end of the dinner, which was a really thoughtful gesture. It may be on the higher price, but its truly value for money for the wine, food, service and experienced provided. (there is also a discount available if you have a certain bank's card).Highly recommend Lawry's to any steak lovers!!! Satisfying portions of food with friendly staff

Had a lovely dinner last night. Steaks were good, not great.The service was great, so thank you for that.A feedback: You need a person with a little more personality to participate in the spinning salad bowl. Ours was so boring, there was no point in her doing it. You have the right tools with the spinning bowl, get your people to have a little bit more enthusiasm. Overall, good
4
Close to the Paragon and Mandarin malls and located on an upper floor overlooking Orchard road, Lawry's offers good ribs and steaks, well made and served. Their wine list includes some real good labels and vintages. Impeccable. Would go there again, no doubt
5
The food was delicious, very good quality and the service was excellent. We sat on a table just by the window so the view to Orchard Rd delighted our evening
4
I got the Lawry's cut of prime rib medium rare. Done to perfection right at my table along with fresh green peas and I got a baked potato instead of the mashed. Everything was very very good. The price was high but I always believe if it is a meal you will remember for your lifetime, the price is worth it. So the only negative was the $$$$. I had ice tea and with tip I was at about 190 SGD for 1 person
5
Since my son studied in Singapore, it's been 4 years I haven't spend b'day with him. So I decided to flew to Singapore this year. I chose Lawry's because the reputation and I've been visited Lawry's in Los Angeles few times. Honestly it was an awesome evening. Service was great and the food very good as always. The prime ribs is basically melt in your mouth..... Truly a memorable evening. Thank you Lawry's
4
Took my fiancé here for a special dinner. We both had the double lobster tails. The tails we good though they arrived on the cold side. Service was good and the food was good. Don't think it was worth the price of admission though
5
An excellent restaurant to come by if one has the time. I have been a regular of this restaurant for a few times. The food & service standard has remained a plateau of the highest standards. It remains unchanged in the best of ways The wafting aromas of the Roast Prime Rib tempt you before you enter the restaurant. Upon entering you are greeted by warm & friendly staff. The hostess brings you to your table and the "ritual" starts. For me at least. I always order a glass of their New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc. A favorite of mine. For starters I choose the Pan Seared Goose Foie Gras which is full of flavor and perfect with their classic hard roll to mop up the sauces. A good substitute for non Foie Gras guests are the Hokkaido Scallops which is another of my preferred dishes should I feel like having something lighter. Next up is the English Cut of Prime Rib. This is accompanied by the Classic Spinning Bowl Salad rather unique to Steakhouses all around the world. Here they serve it with beetroot, lettuce, hard boiled eggs & crispy croutons as well as their house dressing. Each bite tantalizes your palate while awaiting the savory Prime Rib. The waitress lays down the Horseradish accompaniments, one less spicy than the other, as well as a large steak knife which signals the entrance of the Silver Cart. A symbol of steakhouses worldwide and of course Lawrys. This giant beauty houses my most meaty craving, the prime rib! As the Chef slices 3 decadent slices, my appetites swells and my brain starts to dream about the tastes I'm about to experience. The meat comes with the largest Yorkshire Pudding, Mash Potatoes, Gravy & Au Jus. My 2 most favorite sides are the Creamed Corn & Creamed Spinach. The meat is pull apart tender, if you order it Medium or Med-Rare, and rarely do I put any effort into slicing my meat. The whole thing is a meal that I have when I feel like spoiling myself and someone special. A really fantastic place to go to if you have the time and the cravings. Highly recommended & (in this user's opinion) one of the top 5 steakhouses in Singapore(maybe South-East Asia)

I celebrated my hubby's birthday this year on 2nd Oct at Lawry's. It was our 1st time at Lawry's and one of the most memorable birthday experience so far. About less than a week before my hubby's birthday, though I successfully redeemed my credit card rewards for cash voucher dining at the Lawry's, never did I expect that it would take at least a week for the vouchers to reach my address. This year's birthday was quite an emotional one because we lost our baby last year and I wanted somewhere special where not only I know my hubby would enjoy the food but also the ambience. I contacted the credit card company for assistance but they could not assist at all. 3 days before the actual day, I was already very flustered. It was when I called Lawry's, and explained the whole situation to Imran and to my pleasant surprise, I'm deeply honoured that he was willing to trust me by allowing us to go ahead with the dining without the need to pay up front the total amount of cash vouchers redeemed for. And the vouchers could be handed over to him once I receive it in my mailbox. Imran was so reassuring and said do not worry, just quote my name. My hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience at Lawry's; not just because of the high quality of food, peaceful ambience but we both acknowledged that Imran's sincerity, genuine customer service and magnanimous understanding towards our situation, do make a significant whole lot of difference to our experience that day. We are grateful and cannot thank you enough, Imran! :

We were a party of 8 pax when we dined at Lawrys Restaurant this week and both service and the food didn't disappoint. Ordered mostly Prime rib for our main course, and while the meat, presentation and taste of the steak was good the sidings particularly the creamed spinach and mashed potato lacked in taste. Same goes for the Foie Gras which was over cooked. Otherwise, service from the reception to the service staff was great. I recommend this restaurant for special occasions
2
I have been a regular customer of Lawry’s Singapore over the years, ever since its original location in Paragon before moving to the current home in Mandarin Gallery. My most recent visit was in July 2015 together with my family to celebrate a special occasion. Our experience was less than stellar for 2 reasons: #1. While we agree the quality of the meat and the portion sizes have not changed, the prices have become somewhat out of control. We ordered the Lawry's cut (S$98) while some of us went for the larger, Diamond Jim Brady cut (S$138). The Diamond cut was S$106 on our last visit, but the owner quietly raised its pricing -- how does one justify a 30% price increase? Hyperinflation in Singapore? The same cut in the flagship Beverly Hills location is only USD 55, to put things in perspective.#2. Moreover, under an ongoing birthday promotion we enjoyed a discount for 1 main course, but were still charged taxes and service charge on the pre-discounted amount. We found this to be extremely sneaky – no other restaurant in Singapore does this -- and just adds to the annoyance that we had about #1. Perhaps not many customers notice this practice, but with our total bill near $1,000, we definitely did.All in all, Lawry's still delivers a predictably good prime rib, but beware of the greedy pricing that has engulfed this Singapore franchisee

Was back at Lawry's for the second time upon invitation, after the first visit which didn't go too well. Went on a weekday instead for a late lunch, as opposed to my last visit which was on a Sunday. Service was very attentive and food came quickly. It was also much quieter compared to weekends. So, we got to enjoy the ambience better. Didn't realize that the burgers (which I badly wanted to try again) were only available on weekends. So, I ordered the chicken and foie gras dish instead. Foie gras was good but chicken was very average. It is a steak place after all. My dining companions ordered the lamb and the English cut. Both were without complaints. I would have to go back again to eat the burgers and try other things on the menu though. Great job overall second time around. Now, this is the kind of service I expect from a fine establishment such as Lawry's. Keep it up

Was back for a second visit to Lawry after the wonderful experience we had on our first visit. However, disappointing to say dinner was a let down that night... We ordered the mushroom sizzler but it was a tad too salty even after we tried mixing up the mushrooms ourselves. Salt was not evenly distributed..perhaps it would be good to go easy on the salt rather than an overdose? Next up the Silver trio which consists of the cream spinach, cream corn and peas. Nothing stands out just normal. For the mains, we ordered two sets of English cut. Our first bite, beef was cold, even the mash potatoes that came with it was also cold.. Not even a tinge of warmness in the food! We remembered on our first visit, the beef was served warm at least, plates were also heated up which really make a difference to the food. We thought we might have recalled wrongly.. Thus we checked with the server if the plates are supposed to be heated up and they said Yes. We feedback on the spot to her and commented that the beef was cold and the plates were also not heated up when it was served to us... She was very apologetic and her manager also came up and apologise.. The reason the manager gave was that there was a sudden overflowing crowd that night, hence it resulted in the plates not being heated up soon enough..Paying a hefty price to dine at Lawry. I would certainly expects a consistency in the food quality and control despite whatever the reason there is! I guess it would takes us a really long while before we will revisit again

We have fillet of mignon. Serves perfectly delicious.
Ambience of restaurant is good. Just that don't sit the area facing H&M screen.
5
We enjoyed everything about this dining experience. Ice cold forks with the spinning salad and chef carving custom cuts of prime rib at the table. What a class act! The staff is superbly well trained. Cannot think of anything they could do better
5
Went with a colleague and had a lovely lunch. We had pasta with mushrooms and later, waffles for dessert. The ice cream waffles was delicious. I'm sure they've used fresh ingredients and made the batter from scratch, based on the taste. Rich, but, not too sweet or heavy
5
If there's 1 word to describe Lawry's The Prime Rib...I can only think of superlatives - "Awesomeness!", "fantastic!"...but then, dining experience at Lawry's is beyond 1 word. It's a total experience. Something that will see you coming back for more, as it did on me, budget willing.The thing that strikes you are the service level. The staff are well trained and seasoned...great accompaniment to their fabulous signature Prime Rib, which alone, is worth the "damage to the wallet". I use "damage" as the price range is not for everyone thinking of a simple beef steak. So what endears me to Lawry's ? Let me list it succinctly - - service, quality, ambience ... I think that much describe Lawry's in a nut shell. And yes...that Prime Rib...medium rare... I am definitely going back for it. (^__^)
5
Expensive restaurant but worth the cost. We paid approximately $350 Canadian - American for dinner ( no alcohol) for 2 of us. The service is very very good. My husbands prime rib was perfection. My filet mignon was so tender I loved it! We had the crepes Suzette for dessert, they come to the table and make it right in front of you. So fun! I would recommend this restaurant to meat lovers and couples looking for romance ❤
5
I would specially like to compliment the staff Renu and especially Danish for their excellent service. All the rest of the staff there were awereproviding very good service. They offered to take photos for us, every now and then they would asked if we are ok with the food or if the food is to our likings. Danish even took the initiative to ask if we are celebrating any special occasions. As it is my birthday month, i was given a complimentary bday cake ( with many of them singing bday song for me), many of them wishing me happy birthday, and even 50% off my meal. They really really WOWED me. The food there.. delicious.. i had an enjoyable meal there and would return again, for their food and service as a way to support them. All of them were especially friendly and great. Despite the price, i would still be back and will definitely bring my friends along too. Thank u so much everyone there. I already have plans to celebrate a few of my friends' birthdays there and it would definitely be a happy and enjoyable celebration there, i can assure.. pls go and have a try.. the food is really good... n their service.. TOP CLASS! Thank u once again...happy customer signing off.. :
5
Attentive and Excellent Service Staff.Was unwell due to back pain and I just stood up to ease the pain. Staff immediately gave me a cushion without asking. Was impressed
3
Food is average here... Nothing great.. Service is efficient ...I cannot find a reason to come back here again since there are many new and better restaurants opening in Singapore
5
My wife and i visited Lawry's during the weekend of the Singapore GP and it turned out to be a fabulous choice for a pre-race bite. We were seated next to the window with a stunning view overlooking orchard rd & both settled for english cuts of prime beef, medium well and the 3 slices were cut to perfection tableside in the awsome silver carts.The creamy sweetcorn and yorkshire pudding complimented the beef perfectly and the au jus was to die for.The traditional spinning bowl salad beforehand was delightful and the staff were friendly, attentative and they played a major part in what can only be described as a fantastic dining experience.We cannot wait to return to Lawry's on our next trip to Singapore. Highly recommende
5
Really good service and awesome food. Had the rib eye. Good amount of fat in it. Brought in a birthday cake for my friend and they accommodated. This is not normal in singapor
5
Nothing like the good old days, great service , good people , and a smile;) had a good time , didn't even have to look for service it was just there all the time. Relaxing place highly recommended.
4
My friend and I had the Lawry's tea time menu on Saturday. It was $48++ for 2 people, consisting of 4 savouries and 5 desserts and 2 pots of tea available in a few flavours. Don't be fooled by their bite-sized appearance. They are very filling and we could hardly have dinner after that. The atmosphere was great, quiet with few people around after the lunch crowd cleared. We arrived earlier than our reservation time but the staff let us sit down. The staff were very attentive and kept refilling our glasses with water without us having to get their attention. We stayed there from 2+ to around 5+pm. Perfect place for an afternoon catch up with friends.I did not give full marks because our first waitress wasn't very good at explaining the different teas
3
I had my first visit to Lawry's in July to celebrate a birthday. Service was good in general, everyone was rather friendly, the salad although gimmicky, was ok. We ordered two steak dishes which according to the people who ate them were "ok" and "very good, but quite a small portion". I ordered a burger and was raving on about how tasty it was until I found a strand of hair in it. I was already at my last few bites. So, that was a big disappointment, as it would have been perfect. I called the service staff over and she asked if I would like to have another burger to replace the one I had. I couldn't possibly have eaten anymore. So, I declined the offer. She called her manager over and he actually picked the strand of hair off my plate and muttered something about checking with his kitchen staff about it. He never came back to me. At the end of the meal, we asked for the check and basically, there was zero service recovery attempt. I wasn't expecting much, but maybe a 10% discount would be nice. We spent quite a bit (almost $400), since it was a birthday celebration. Heck, I wouldn't have minded if the manager came back to say that they would like to maybe offer us a small dessert each (there were only 3 adults and 2 young children (one of whom is an infant!) at our table) as an apology. That would have at least given me a feel good factor after seeing a yucky strand of hair in my food. Some kind of recovery is generally expected of a restaurant such as Lawry's. But nope, nothing, nada! Greatly disappointed with the lack of interest towards my complaint. Surprised at the non-recovery attempt. I didn't want to request for anything or complain further as it was supposed to be a happy occasion and I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. What would have been a very good experience is now just a very average experience. Would I go back again? Maybe. But not until I've forgotten about this ordeal altogether. Knowing me, it would take a while

Service was the best I have ever experience at anywhere in singapore. Food is of good portion and quality. They put on a good show to cook your food in front of you for some of the dishes. They service with the utmost sincerety and heart. The ambience is romantic and cosy, good for romantic dinners, families and bonding sessions. There were 2 birthday celebrations when I dined here, so happening. Their rendition of the birthday song is also very different. Should give this place a visit when in town
5
Went to lawrys for anniversary dinner and the service crew was awesome and friendly. The food was ok. Thumbs up for the service excellence
5
Love how each of the Lawry's franchise (whether it be on Hong Kong or Singapore) - quality never ceases to change. I am super happy that I found the time to visit Lawry's on this trip even if it was dinner for one. I surely miss it!!
5
Have been to Lawry's for many years, from previously Paragon Shopping Centre to the current Mandarin Gallery. Lawry's has been a special place to us, from datings, birthdays and even our proposal.. Last visited for my wife's birthday.. together with our newly born 1 year old boy. Nostalgic feeling to be back.. Service is still as good, if not even better. Good is still as delicious, just as we expected. All in all, we had a memorable dining experience.. Looking forward to our next visit. Thank you.
5
Wonderful food, excellent service staff with amazing dedication. We were attended to by Solehin and Avy. The visit was nothing short of perfect!
5
We are planning to have a romantic dinner while we are in singapore.And this restaurant were choose by my good friend.The athmosphere is wonderful and seems lots of couple had dinner that night.While 4 tables including next to us having a birthday celebration with the Lawry's staff took their picture and give a nice Lawry's frame. My fiance late that night asked me to marry him and we got our picture and frame for us too.This restaurant will always have a special place in our heart and a must visit everytime we are in Singapore but not only that, another reason because This restaurant having the best rib ever that makes me hungry and craving for it everytime I talk about it
5
Excellent food and wonderful service staffs! Everyone greeted you once you step into the restaurant. Love the steak and the Yorkshire pudding that comes along.. Yum! Steak was juicy and nicely done. What impresses me most was when we are leaving the restaurant, the door lady greeted me by my name. This is what I called personalised service! They takes the effort to remember each of their customer name. Impressively
4
Great service and good ambience. Always been here for many special occasions. Will always be back for more.
4
Excellent service, ambience and food! Will definitely recommend to those looking for their meat fix!
2
that's the "Lawry's Cut", the second largest cut out of five. I think that's a little skimpy don't you think? I hate to see what the 3 other lighter cut look like...
4
Dining at Lawry's is always comfortable and enjoyable,I have been going there regularly for 3 years now and I have to say that the quality of service and food has always been, and is still at the very top. It is never easy to be consistent and it's unbelievable that Lawry's has managed this. 4 Thumbs Up
4
Excellent experience dining with Lawry's @ mandarin gallery. Not my first time and I will always be back for more. Everyone seems to be enjoying their steak as much as I do. Thanks Solihin for a better dining experience
5
It was my third time at The Lawry's and it made no disappointment for me and my friend once again. This time, I made a reservation on their web site and luckily got the table next the window for some views on the street. My orders were for their signature salad, shrimp cocktail, and the prime rib cuts. It was the first time of my friend here and she liked it a lot. If you love steak, this place is one of a must try if you visit Singapore
3
Went there for my 25 years of employment. This event included my 31/2 son of which I had some concerns. He was not in the best fprm but acceptable. The staff was extremly nice and servise was excellent. The meals were also very good. There may be a bit of sticker shock but it is Singapor

Went to Lawry's for my wife and a friend's birthday. We had over 12 people in our party. I'm lactose intolerant so I can't eat the standard mashed potatoes or yorkshire pudding. I asked for a substitute and the most obvious would be baked potatoes where other restaurants I've been to would give. But no... not here... the best they could do was green beans. Not exactly what I would call a good alternative to a mashed potato or yorkshire pudding. They said if I wanted baked potato would have to pay extra. Later, my 6 year old daughter's water ran out... asked them for "warm" water. The server came back and gave her "hot" water and she burned her throat. Told her 24 hours before her throat didn't feel sore anymore. The manager blamed it on another adult on the table who handed the water bottle to my daughter and said my friend accepted the water bottle and said it was okay.There were smaller issues with the service but we certainly would never return to this place again. While food overall was decent we don't need to be subjected to such poor service especially when we spend over $1000 on a meal

Celebrated our anniversary (rather belatedly) at Lawry's. The staff were very friendly and service excellent from the moment we stepped in :)We had the prime rib (as usual) and it was delicious (as usual). Also had the crepe suzette... Over-ate.... As usual :
4
This is our first experience at Lawry's. Needless to say, it is certainly lovely! The ambience is awesome! The food is lovely! Most of all, we have been so well served, with very pleasant waitresses and chef! It's a perfect place and very comfortable for dining
4
We had a birthday lunch at lawry's on Singapore's national day and had an amazing time. Food was great and the birthday special was a nice touch! Thank you Lawry's!
4
I went there for lunch with a few of my friends on June 27. I was blown away by their excellent service! Everyone from the bartender, to the service staffs and the maitre d' are extremely nice and friendly. It made me feel so much at home. The food was pretty good too
5
My first time here at Lawrys and definitely not the last. The service is really awesome. very friendly servers even the managers. A fine dining restaurant that won't make you feel intimidated. The food is really good. Overall, The service and the food will make you want to come back again
5
I came to Lawry's with my family for my birthday dinner. It was our first time to Lawry's and we were very happy with the whole dining experience. I was glad to learn there is a birthday promotion of a free main course for the lowest price main course, complimentary photograph shot and a slice of cake. The service was really good. We were pleasantly welcomed into the restaurant, our waters refilled very promptly, food served very cheerfully. There is nothing more to ask for. We were shown to a nice corner of the restaurant which was appreciated as we always preferred more privacy. The place was not dauntingly quiet, but just right, very comfortable.The piped music were classical songs that was enjoyable.The food was delicious too. I like the Prime Ribs best, they were really moist, juicy slices of rare beef. It tastes nothing like how it looks. Very yummy. The medium fillet mignon, garlic mushroom and asparagus was also delicious. I would definitely come back again! :
4
Came here for my anniversary. The staff service was superb and very friendly. The food was great, had English Cut and the meat was very tender. The sauce can be a bit salty and you might want to ask them to put on the side. Love the pudding. GD to come for special occasion
5
Not our first time here and definitely won't be the last! The food was amazing coupled with wonderful service. We came for my birthday and it was truly unforgettable :) two thumbs u

Easily one of the best and overpriced steakhouses in Singapore, Lawry’s the Prime Rib is the place for meat lovers, that’s if money isn't an issue. While it may be pricey, I was never disappointed with Lawry's. The service is always observant, friendly and prompt, the staffs are all friendly and helpful in recommending the selections. there's a slight change in decor ever since they moved over to Mandarin Gallery, the food remains spot on, and there portions were generous ,The prime rib was done to perfection New arrival to Lawry's should give their signature Prime Rib Dinner set a go and request for the Lawry's cut 250g of the most popular cut. It is worth a visit at least once in a pay rise, but on the balance it was worth it. I was totally impressed with the atmosphere! We shall return
1
My first time eating Lawry's was in Jakarta more than 15 years ago. After it closed down, I finally find time to come to Singapore branch. It is surprising why Jakarta branch closed and Singapore branch stayed open. They are equally bad
5
We are very impressed by the food and service. Roast beef was prepared to perfection and the service was impeccable. We enjoyed our lunch
5
Amazing food! Excellent service! The best Singapore slings ever!! The bartender...I'm so bad at names was awesome. I love Singapore slings but I prefer them with vodka vice gin (so much smoother) he took his time and they were perfect! The food was tasty and well prepared
5
Whenever I crave for roast beef with mash potatoes, I will come to Lawry's. They are specialty in steaks and roast beef. The restaurant is furnish in a fine dining ambience. Service is good but the price is on the high. The roast beef is really good as I have been here many times
4
The food is simple and well executed, the meat ( I ordered fillet mignon) was perfect, I was quite impressed with the waitress asking me to cut in the middle to check whether it was cooked to my requirements. Side dishes simple and tasty. I was not particularly impressed with the salad, but that is because I am not keen on thousand island like dressings. The red wine ( San Giovese) was excellent.Very nice service, genuine, professional and friendly, extremely proactive. Fantastic window view on Orchard Road. The restaurant is pleasantly quiet
5
excellent!!! Service and food is perfect would definitely comeback. Made us feel special it was an experience worth it for the pric
5
The best ever prime ribs i have ate especially the english yorkshire pudding( The BEEEST in Singapore), always a beautiful ambience, warm and friendly waitress, as well as the management.The meat is cut and serve in front of us.Have celebrated every year in Lawrys.ThANKS for the wonderfull experience
5
The most tender rib ever!!! @ medium rare i didn't expect it to melt in my mouth like that!!! And u also have the chef prepared the food right in front of u!!!! Cool!!!
5
This is a come as you are fine dining place. We have eaten here many times and even request our waitress (Princess). My husband has had many business dinners here and they are very accommodating and have rooms that can be partitioned off for privacy. I will really miss eating here. :
5
I visited singapore during my summer holiday with my family. We reserved the place the day before because from our past experience it seems full and im thankful that we did because it was actually full with guests. We made a reservation for 7:30 pm just in time for dinner on a Saturday. The service was excellent and we had a great time. We also specially requested to sit near the windows so that we can also enjoy the view. The price of the meal is quite expensive since it is a fine dining restaurant. The food itself tasted amazing and i would definately go back again. :
3
Didn't enjoy much dinner at Lawry's.. First service was bad, my entree come first and after 15min after i finished the entree my partner arrived. I order oyster for entree and didn't feel was fresh or taste amazing. For main i order fillet mignon and was just ok, also take 10 min to the sides arrive after main come. The mashed potato was tasteless. The food for me are just average and for the price u pay for should be much bette
5
One of the things I miss about the UK is having a Sunday roast dinner but the roast dinner at Lawry's is better than any I've had in an English restaurant. The meal comes with a spinning bowl salad to start, which is made in front of you and is a nice fresh appetiser to the meal. A chef then comes to you with the roast beef and you can choose how you would like it cut. The beef is served with gravy, mash potato and a Yorkshire pudding and you choose your vegetables as side orders. Everything was so delicious including the Yorkshire pudding, which coming from Yorkshire is very difficult to get right!! The only downside is that you can only have beef, there are no other roasted meats available. This restaurant isn't cheap but well worth the money, we will definitely be returning.
4
I liked the room setting, the atmosphere and especially the beef. Unique taste at Lawry's. I wished though the dish comes with the famous fluo English green beans on top of the mash potatoes. Very good head waiter but unfortunately our chinese waiter (freshly "imported" from China), on top of a very poor English, had a very strong perspiration odor.
4
food and service are excellent! Will come back here for special events again. Spent with my hubby for his birthday!
3
The fare here was decent but not mind blowing. Meat is generally expensive in SG and this place as no different. I am not sure that I would come back, but was decent for a lunch down the street with a friend in town. Service like many places in singapore needs improvement as does the gravy for the as does the yorkshere pudding.
5
We chose Lawry's to celebrate our first wedding anniversary on the recommendation of a friend, and we had a fantastic evening. The food was superb and the theatre of how the food was served made it feel particularly special. Our bartender went out of his way to provide us with a lovely experience, ensuring we received a complimentary dessert as he knew it was our anniversary. We will certainly be back in the future
5
Came for Father's Day set menu with my boy and hubby.. Warmly greeted by the staff on arrival and they were attentive to my little one's needs too.Set menu, which was a 6 course meal had interesting dishes and of course their signature prime ribs. Food was tasty and was an overall enjoyable experience
5
In my opinion, this is the best steak place in Singapore. Attentive service, professional exchange of steak knowledge and great ambience. Cannot go wrong :
5
We loved it.My husband and I went while our daughters went to another restaurant for sushi. The meat was excellent, service was great, presentation was wonderful as well.I would definitely recommend this place
4
Lawry's gives a very American steak experience. Huge portions of meat and very generous sides. The steak was very well prepared and the staff attentive and helpful. The quality of meat was good. My only complaint was the gravy for the steak. I would have preferred it a bit more thicker.If you like steaks Lawry's is a mus
4
First visit to Lawry's & definitely impressed by the steak. Tender & juicy that goes really well together with the horse radish. With UOB credit card, you are entitled to additional 20% discount. Attentive manager who went around talking to customers & ensured that they are well taken care of. Definitely worth a second visit & more
5
Long time since we came to Lawrys back in the 90's in Plaza Senayan Jakarta .. So consistent, so memorable, excellent !! We ordered California cut n Lawry's traditional as well as New Zealand Salmon, fresh Canadian Oysters.. Accompanied by Pinot Noir Sherwood Estate New Zealand !! Two thumbs up !!! Highly recomended, you hv to try this, service by Rose n the others was fantastic .. We'll be back n it wont take 15 years ..
5
Met like an old friend and greeted by every member of staff. Chose the "English Cut". Expensive, but beautifully presented. Chef brings a huge stainless steel carving unit, with all the joints presented. You tell him what cut you want and off he goes. Succulent meat, cooked to perfection. Really excellent. Great Yorkshire pudding and served with their signature mashed potatoes.Expensive, but very good indeed. Enjoyed the food and the "theatre" of the place
4
The Lawry's cut, medium rare, taste wonderful, almost melting in your mouth. The portion is also very generous. The prime rib includes a salad and mashed potato and it was an excellent meal. I recommend the English Cut as it really brings out the flavor in the beef
5
Excellent food, very good service, nice and pleasant staff. They make you feel very special. Definitely recommended for a special occasion
4
This is a consistently good restaurant that you can count on for steaks. Lawry's is one of the few places which serves roast beef well, so it makes a nice change from other steakhouses. At a recent family dinner here, we were pleased to find that the quality of food has remained high, despite not visiting for two years. I tried the rib-eye instead of the roast beef and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Service was warm and friendly, but they forgot some of our requests. For example, they didn't bring the horseradish sauce despite several reminders. Nonetheless it was a good dinner and we will be back.
5
Come here regularly with my family but this time with a friend. Really good service, went for the Uob 1 for 1 lunch offer which was a really good deal. We had a lawry's cut each which comes in generous portions. Starter was the spinning bowl salad which is always fun to watch.staff very professional, it was my friends birthday and I didn't even have to mention the kind host asked if it was anyone's birthday and we were surprised with a complimentary cake and ohot which they printed off on the spot. Highly recommended for special occasions, birthdays and whatnot!
5
Was actually looking for something more unique to Singapore but stumbled across Lawry's and decided to have a taste of home instead. We didn't have reservations but ended up with a great table and a terrific dinner. No complaints. Nice meal
4
We didn't have a reservation and while it was busy lunch time, we didn't wait long and were given a table next to windows over looking Orchard Road. The staff were meticulous in their service and take care to explain what does on. When you have a chilled fork to eat with their famous spinning salad, you know it's a good spot for an exceptional dining experience. And it was comfortable enough without being too stiff. We had the Singapore and California cuts - they were beautiful and so was the mashed and Yorkshire pudding. Great place to have a birthday treat too. There was a credit card promotion, so it was very value for money 
5
I dined with 9 friends & family during the Chinese New Year holidays and had a wonderful experience. The welcome, table/view over Orchard Road,service and quality of food especially the Roast Beef were exceptional. My compliments to Restaurant Manager Imran and staff for their very professional attention. I find the price relevant to the prime location, quality of food and service and will certainly refer others and go back again
5
We go here every few months when we want some really good steak/beef. Although maybe a little expensive, the experience and the quality of the food is really worth it.The menu is not extensive, we have never found this an issue.Every meal we have had there the quality of the food has been brilliant.The service has also been really good - we have been here 6 times and only once did we have to point out that we had our food before our drinks ?!?! The moment we pointed this out they made up for it (I think they had a new waitress working that night).Not really a place to take children.Enjoy your visit and the food

Let me begin by saying that we have been loyal customers of this restaurant since it opened in the late 1990s. We have followed it as it changed location and we have our Christmas Day Dinner with them every single year. For the last 2 years they have reduced their service level dramatically. Extra table are put in and the famous beef trolley, from which you meat is cut for you, remains hidden away. It is a key part of the Lawry experience. They still insist on reciting banal scripts when they prepare their 'famous' spinning bowl salad but cut back. In my opinion the festive season, when diners may visit for the first time, is an opportunity to really impress them with food and service so that they will return at another time. This experience of feeling rushed and the whole experience being diluted means that we shall have to find an alternative venue next December. I did complain to the manager in Christmas 2013 but is did me no good at all and we had a repeat performance in 2014. Sadly Lawry's The Prime Rib is a sad farewell. We shall not return
4
I had a chance to dine at Lawry's The Prime Rib Singapore branch last Friday evening. I am a BIG fan of Lawry's restaurants, and look forward to each visit with no shortage of anticipation.This is my second visit to Lawry's Singapore branch. While the menu is almost an exact replica of Lawry's Stateside branch menus, and the prime rib and various side dishes were every bit as delicious, I came away feeling that the experience fell a bit short. A lot of this has to do with the venue itself, which lacks the "grand dining room" feel of the American and Tokyo locations. Instead of one or two large, ornately-decorated dining rooms, the Singapore branch feels confining and the rooms much smaller. The atmosphere lacks the "buzz" that one finds in most of the other places; the wait staff are very professional, but very subdued and a bit too subservient for my taste.As with almost everything in Singapore, prices are stratospheric, particularly for wine. Expect to pay at least double what you would at a U.S. branch for the same meal. Which makes it really not worth the price, in my book.A good meal, but at these prices, and with a less exciting atmosphere than I am used to in a Lawry's experience, I will wait until my return to the U.S.A. next time in order to fulfill my prime rib cravings...
5
Stumbled upon this place after an evening of Christmas shopping... What a delightful surprise. Food was delicious, service was the best I've ever had in Singapore and I will be back again. Go, you'll love it.
4
Classic decor, attentive service, and excellent beef, this is an easy choice for a classic meal. Original recipe spinning salad, roast beef from the silver trolley, and perfectly prepared desserts. We shared a sample plate of six, (trifle, mudcake, cheesecake) - very good
5
I had a dinner on christmas eve and it was very nice. The steak taste melted on my mouths. I can't describe so much, you have to try. Very brilliant recommended. Of course you have to spent a lot of money for just a dinner but it's worth-ed
5
We have been here several times and each time the service is excellent and the standard of the food remains as good.The members of the staff are well trained , paying attention to details and spontaneous in attending to our requests. And what more, they speak fluent EnglishWe need not like the taste of the butter when it was served with the rolls. We gave a feedback and it was changed and the captain even offered to give us fresh rolls.We prefer the prime rib here as it is tender and moist.For small eaters like us, the smallest serve of the Californian cut is more than enoug

It's been years not having Lawry's back in Los Angeles, USA & Jakarta Indonesia, which had been closed for almost 15 years now. So when I have a long stay in Singapore this time, I asked my family to join me to taste one of my favy steak before I was staying in Los Angeles many years ago. I chose the English cut 200 gr. Dinner set menu including freshly prepared with homemade salad dressing. Pudding cake is included and tastes one of a kind. The spinach and corn are optional now as they were included years ago back in LA, USA.My family tried baby back rib & salmon steak. We all loved it.The prices are worth of the food quality and service in an exclusively designed place. It's located in the fourth floor in the mandarin gallery, connected to the Mandarin Orchard hotel.The staffs are all friendly and helpful in recommending the selections
5
We gave the Singapore location another chance and we were not disappointed . The JIM BRADY cut did not disappoint and my wife's salmon was cooked perfectly . Service was superb and we look forward to our next visit in the New Yea
4
enjoyed celebrating my friend's bday. had a free photo taken and cake too.ordered the set lunch and the portion is very good. The steak is cut and served right in front of you too. the spinning salad is fresh and crispy. worth it to go and try if you have not
3
The roast beef/prime rib are ordinary like what you will get in a lot of ordinary restaurants in North America.But they charge a premium price.The halibut portions are tiny about 5 cm diameter
4
This is a premium restaurant, expect to pay premium price for it (SGD 100 for a 220gram prime rib). The atmosphere of this restaurant is very nice, the staff and service excellent. The prime rib is unfortunately just about average for me, although I love the Yorkshire pudding! Nice selection of desserts (pannacota for me) rounds up the very hearty meal
4
This is my second visit to Lawry's.. the first time i was pregnant so didnt manage to sample their famous beef.... so decided to try them this time round... but i wasnt impress.....The beef is soft and nice but the sauce accompanied them was rather bland... i love the Yorkshire pudding too which is nice and crispy but a little too small... Was impress with their pan fried fish ... the prawn sauce that accompanied the fish is nice!!!Last but not least, it is quite nice to watch the staff prepare the cold rotating salad :)More photos and detailed review:http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/11/eat-lawrys-prime-rib.htm
5
Fantastic service in a great atmosphere. Go for the ribeye set meal. The Halloween special drinks were refreshing before my long flight to u
4
The spinning bowl salad cannot be missed! Lovely start of a sumptuous Sunday lunch. The roast beef comes in large portions so go for the Singapore cut like we did if you have an average appetite. The Sunday brunch sets sounded better than they tasted - Lobster pasta, burger etc. The roast beef or the ribs would be a better choice.Service is slow though polite so give this place a miss if you're in a rush
5
My husband and I try to dine at Lawry's very time we're in Singapore. Their Prime Rib and sidings never fail to satisfy. Their other offerings are also very well-prepared, particularly their seafood ones, such as lobster tails, shrimp cocktail, and scallops. Wine list is also well put together. Service is very attentive, but never hovering. They tend to leave us to dine in relative privacy, but are always easy enough to wave over for anything we need. Ambiance is pleasant, even when they're at full capacity. When eating as a couple, we are usually seated next to the expansive glass window, overlooking Orchard Road. They occasionally have promos tied with certain credit card companies, such as 1-for-1 meals during lunch
5
My wife had made a reservation at the Lawry's to celebrate my birthday. The restaurant made an effort to find out about my birthday and the staff went out of their way to ensure that we were treated well and special. They served Lawry's special salad at the table and displayed the simple art of mixing salad in a spinning bowl. The beef was cooked as per our request and it was good. The ribs were cut at your table and with the Yorkshire pudding, it was wonderful. More than the food, it was a pleasant dining experience that made my day. We were given a table away from the main crowd and sort of created a private dinner ambience. The staff were attentive and were always around when we needed them. A birthday cake, a framed family photograph and a complimentary dish was all included in the package which added to the special experience. I really enjoyed the dinner and the ambience at the restaurant. The restaurant really know how to make their customers feel good, even it means doing beyond what is normally required
4
The spinning salad beautiful and fresh, then the beef with the Yorkshire pudding, this was really nice, it was a shame there is so many birthday wishes, every few minutes there is the staff arriving at a table to sing birthday wishes, gets too much
4
This was good food, the beef was great and the Yorkshire pudding divine- unlike a previous review I had for another restaurant in Singapore.The mashed potato was a little tasteless - I always make mine with butter and cream not just milk.The service was a bit patchy- some time very attentive and then left waiting for ages
4
Starts well with the unique spinning bowl salad. We also had appetizers - fresh oysters, scallops and crab cake. California Cut was a generous serving of juicy prime beef with golden Yorkshire pudding with a delicious gravy. Lawry's Cut only if you have a large appetite.The Kurobuta Baby Back ribs were nicely seasoned with tender meat easily peeled off the bone. Sides of sauted onions, creamed spinach and mushrooms are recommended.The desserts are worth the calories - mud pie, pecan nut brownie and trifle.Overall, great food and friendly service but it all comes at a price
5
The service is excellent, the food is superb and the wine is good too... Definitely nice place. But too many birthday celebrations when we were there. Our intimate dinner was disrupted by singing of birthday songs every few minutes!I think the restaurant was giving 50% discount for birthdays when we visited. Anyway, still nice experience overall
1
Top priced steak on the menu was not up to snuff. Lack of marble , chewy and far to thinly cut. @ 160.00 SGD a complete rip off. OK I know not to go to a Beef house for Seafood but my wife is a seafood eater. The Canadian Lobster Tail appetizer was chewy and I suspect frozen. The King Salmon was so dry my cat would have trouble eating it  The service was fantastic too bad the food was horrible. I refused the 50.00 comp voucher. Total bill for 2 SGD 459.00 ( less 100 voucher
4
I was never disappointed with Lawry's. The service was always attentive, friendly and prompt. The prime rib was always done to perfection and they are always able to provide the right doneness. Even our draft beer was served at the right drinking temperature. The only area that in my opinion need some improvement is the caesar salad. They can use better quality lettuce and the sauce was too heavy
1
This was my family's first visit to Lawry's for a double birthday dinner, so we were ready to spend some money. The atmosphere is great and the service is excellent; the waiters are obviously very well trained. But to say the food was ordinary is an overstatement. The spare rib portions were undersized and completely forgettable; like supermarket ribs dipped in Lawry's sauce. My wife was ill from the salmon after dinner, and the desserts were small had obviously been standing in the fridge too long. I can say that the spinning salad was tasty and the mocktails were delicious. We left at $100 a head (yet none of us drinks alcohol) making this our most expensive dinner ever in Singapore. And how was it? The food was so disappointing we are re-doing the birthday dinner next week - somewhere else. I wouldn't have been happy paying half of that and it will be my last visit ever to Lawry's. Exceptionally disappointing
4
Took my son here to celebrate his new job and hang out together plus give Lawry's a trial run. Walked past it so many times and wondering what the fuss was about. Having made a reservation and circumstantially arriving late,we were greeted amiably by the staff and led to our table in a restaurant with decor reminiscent of the Tanglin Club i.e all the areas named after iconic Singapore landmarks but essentially all browns,beiges and dark wood........very retro and a throwback to the 60's at best. Clean and bright but more like a movie set I thought. Staff attired in uniforms more akin to tea rooms than a steak restaurant but again very friendly and welcoming,except I must say for the 'Chef' who when arriving at our table gave a perfunctory bored wave over his shoulder as he was introduced. Not a show stopper but at these prices not what you expect. The food itself or should I say the steaks looked superb and we opted for the Lawry's Prime Cut and we both agreed this was simply fantastic being perfectly cooked,slightly rare and as tender as you could wish for. The 'sides' however were a different story with everything being reduced to a pulp and not very appealing at that so creamed corn/potatoes/spinach which other than the prime rib,together conspired to make this like food for the toothless. Not a single crunchy firm vegetable in sight or on offer..........very poor Lawry's. The salad starter was poor,limp brown edged lettuce and a gloopy sauce all spun in some manic tabletop tumble dryer,an inauspicious start. The portions were generous so we skipped on deserts and got our bill which was frankly 'steep' but on balance worth it for trying out an institution.Recommended for meat lovers only
4
First time in this place even it has been in business for a long while.Very nice and friendly staff guided us to the seats by the glass window and assisted us with our food order. The spinning salad was interesting.. the food is nice but waiting time was slightly a little long. Perhaps you really need to wait for good food.Was lucky that there's a planned trip to eat here and I also got a voucher during this period, got to try the like prime ribs they have
4
Just got back from Lawry's, service excellent and on the whole the food was good.The spinning salad is fun to watch & as most reviewers say it's still a basic salad.I ordered fillet mignon & asked for well done & it was explained that I would have to wait 30 mins which was ok by us, my husband ordered the Prime Rib dinner which is cut & served at the table by a chef from a continuously 'roaming hot trolley' ie already cooked,My steak arrived promptly but surprisingly we had to wait for my husbands meal which meant mine was going cold, my husbands was eventually served but as he asked for a medium cooked steak he was sliced a piece from the end of the cut which was by then lukewarm.Having said that my steak was beautiful & my husbands Yorkshire pudding was great too.Wine very expensive
5
Excellent services provided once we reached. They are very attentive and friendly. We have our celebration for my buddy birthday and we really enjoy it. It really worth every cent for the great food and service. Food really being cook just right and excellent and they even made some of it just beside our table. Really a sweet moment when my friend's child received a small soft toy from Lawry and when thee stuff comes out singing birthday songs, served the cakes and even take and present the birthday photo instantly. My wife especially enjoy it and we'll surely go back again and again
5
My husband and I visit Singapore in July 2014. We had dinner at Lawry's The Prime Rib in Singapore. The food & service was excellent. I was totally impressed with the atmosphere! We will return! Our waitress Diana was great! And the Assistant General Manager came to our table and greeted us
4
That was a nice birthday celebration we had with our friends - on top Lawry's celebrated their own 15 year anniversary. I knew Lawry's already from some visit in Hong Kong before and recommended our friends to try it out and celebrate in style...The food was great and the very attentive service made it just perfect. Just go for the prime rib itself if you are a meatlover - it is just amazing ! Side dishes are rich and plenty of choices and you will love it. Not cheap but all worth. Location is great too - overlooking Orchard Road... Enjo
4
Couldn't get into our hotel for dinner so asked the front desk to recommend a steak house nearby. Great service from a very friendly team, great steak only disappointment was having to wait for the side dishes to arrive - 10 minutes after the steak!The team did go the extra mile to help us celebrate our wedding anniversary :-)
5
Went to Lawry's for my birthday dinner with my girlfriend on may the 3rd and I must say I was very impressed with the service. Everyone was prompt, very polite and always had a smile on their face. If I had to wear that French Maid uniform I wouldn't be very happy but I could not detect any sign of unhappiness among the staff; they genuinely seem happy to work there! Hats off to you dedicated folk!Food wise, the spinning bowl salad was prepared beside the table and was pretty novel. Nothing much to shout home about. But where the restaurant really shines is in its prime rib. (duh right?) I had the English cut(200g) whereas my date had the California cut(160g). The meat was melt-in-your-mouth perfect tenderness and the fat was oh so sinful and delicious.Oh top of all of that, Lawry's did help us take a birthday photo with the actual copy given to us and soft-copy emailed to us. They even provided a small lovely cake which I thought was a nice touch. I'm not sure if it applies to everyone but we received 50% off our second main course just because of my birthday which makes it compelling value considering the original price would be close to $200.Thank you Lawry's for making my birthday a very happy and memorable one! We will definitely revisit you again
5
With a group of 5, we had a large variety of foods to try. From the set dinner menu, the lamb shank to the steaks, all the dishes looked and tasted excellent. Definitely worth the cost and will be back when I come back to singapor
3
Lawry's has a distinct style from the 1930s, with a formal, old school ambiance in its polished wood decor. The staff are all dressed as French maids in starched uniforms and dazzling white collars and cuffs. They were unfailingly polite. The experience is all about the theatre - the carnival of the "spinning salad" and the stainless steel carts serving the roast beef at the table.If you like the drama and the atmosphere, then the food is secondary. I had a solid rib eye steak with a huge portion of fries and very tasty broccolli, but the watery minestrone soup disappointed as a starter. When you add on th service charge and the additional side dishes, even a cheaper main course comes close to $100 a person. The wine list was ok, but the service was a little intrusive with a cast of thousands interrupting and hovering. All in all, I enjoyed the meal, but felt more like a theatre reviewer than a diner

We celebrated my wife’s birthday by going to Lawry’s. We had double cut fillet mignon as the main course with mushrooms and spinach. The main course comes with spinning bowl salad. The salad itself is nothing to mention about; you pay for the spinning part. Fillet mignon is good, no doubt about it, but is it worth of SGD$133? No.You get your birthday photo taken, which is nice. Overall, the feeling is artificial; the whole atmosphere is like a rehearsed play.When we left the restaurant, my wife tripped on the restaurant’s wet floor and has now bruises all over. Not a nice memory. This was discussed later with the assistant GM, but apology doesn’t help much when you are bruised.We will not come back. Not only, because of the wet floor, but because if we want to see a show, we go for a show and when we want to have food, we go for a restaurant. Now we just felt uncomfortable with the play and food combination. And the price level is not justifiable

Never a steak lover, but coming to Lawry's changed my taste buds for good. The steak is absolutely the BEST I've tried ever, though Medium Rare looked quite raw, the steak was moist and juicy!Try the rack of lamb, this was another dish that won heaps of praises. Oysters that were served was also about the largest I've seen at any restaurant. Definitely a restaurant that warrants a return visit.Desserts were honestly, so so, but then again, at least they delivered well on what they specialized in - steaks

Excellent service and always a joy to be entertained while eating. Who doesn't like French Maids anyway?If you enjoy theatrics and having an overall more visual and interesting dining experience, no one does it like Lawry’s the Prime Rib. Contrasting from the usual steak grills, texture and taste wise for the roast beef is quite subjective, but the experience is truly unique.Judging from the local response for lawry’s style of roast prime rib beef, you either love it or hate it

OMG...boring....worst salad... big weird show spinning the salad and applying 1000 Island Dressing....??

The elegant, much raved-about Lawrys, known for its prime ribs, used to be situated at Paragon Orchard. I heard about it for a long time, but it was always deemed a very pricey place, especially when I was still a student. My friend and I decided to try it out on my birthday one year, after yearning to go for so long.The elegant interior with appropriately lighting, plush high-back seats and racks of wine. The uniformed waitresses and waiters were all polite in their greetings, and we were seated at our reserved table shortly upon arriving.I had expected the interior to be more formidable, with everyone talking in hushed tones and the diners all dressed up. To my surprise, the ambience was rather family-style, and everyone looked comfortable and happy.We placed our orders and awaited our meals to be served.We had the Chef who came to our table to prepare the salad. She literally mixed and tossed it in front of us, in that large metal bowl. When she finally placed the salad on our table, we were pleasantly surprised at how fresh and delicious it was. This is what they call the Famous Original Spinning Bowl Salad, consisting of Crisp romaine and iceberg lettuce, watercress, shredded beets, chopped eggs and croutons, tossed with our exclusive Lawry's vintage dressing on a bed of iceNow, my Lawrys Cut - their traditional and most popular cut for steaks. I chose medium-rare, my usual. The meat was very tender and easy to cut. The taste was good, with hints of my red wine sauce enhancing the flavors of the beef and the flavors were bursting in my mouth ... hmm yummy. The dish came with Idaho mashed potatoes, Yorkshire Pudding, and Whipped Cream Horseradish.For more detailed information and photos, do visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2013/11/dinner-at-lawrys.htm

Went there last week with friends. Had a bad start. Slipped and fell at entrance of their restaurant as the wooden floor is wet. No apologies, nothing. Everyone just pretended and didn't even bother to check the floor. Was the center of attraction for a few seconds. Luckily I he already passed the wine to the waitress.After that, things went smoothly. Was attended to promptly. Had english cuts steak and was good. Staff carried themselves well and are good hosts.Expensive, but ambience and service made up for it.However, am still sore over that fal

My family has dinner at lawry's very often and we love trying out their different beef and seafood dishes. I can't find the photos from our last visit but the visit before that we had the following food and they were so pampering! My son couldn't decide between the lobster tail and beef so he had both. My husband had the fillet mignon and he claims that he prefers it to their rib eye as it is more juicy. I always liked how their black pepper sauce complements both the fillet mignon and rib eye. The service was excellent with constant checkbacks to make sure we were all well-taken care of. Each time we dine in, we felt like we were VIPs! Awesome place in conclusion

Brought my girl for her birthday dinner at Lawry's and we were both delighted with the food we ordered. She had the Australian Rack of Lamb and me, the Single cut Ribeye. They were so good I told her it's gonna make us their regulars.We ordered the half-dozen fresh shucked Oysters for sharing and boy they were huge! Most of all they were one of the freshest Oysters we've tasted. The best part of our dinner.... The staffs surprised her (and actually myself too) with their signature dessert(on the house) and a birthday song. Such has never been what I would do but she was pleasantly surprised and the smile plastered onto her face for the rest of the night. We were even given a complimentary photo that night. Kudos to the Lawry's team for the well-thought celebration

I was at Lawry's for tea a few months ago with some family members and we enjoyed the food and remarkable service. The quality of food was truly value for money.I was there again today (5/2/14) to celebrate a friend's birthday and truly pleased to experience the same impeccable service that is almost extinct in most restaurants nowadays. The staff are very friendly and attentive which makes the dini...ng a lot more wondeful. Love the food too. We had lobster, fish, pasta and of course the steak, all of which are very well done, especially the steak which is what the restaurant is famous for. We also had the mushrooms sizzle but the dish turned out to be a tad bit too dry. At the end of the meal, the restaurant surprised us with a slice of cake for my birthday friend and the crews sang a birthday song for her. Will definitely go back agai

I am a frequent diner at Lawry’s, and I often endorse it to friends and colleagues. The prime rib is exceptional and the service usually made an effort. HOWEVER I really need to write about what happened to me last Jan 30th, the eve of Chinese New Year, when I experienced what is probably one of the RUDEST wait-staff treatments I’ve ever had anywhere in my 30+ years of dining out. The full story is a bit long but astounding. My companion and I started dining late at 830pm, as per our reservation. They actually gave us a great table (it was not full). By mid-meal, there was just one other table left in the restaurant, apart from ours. I am guessing it was because it was eve of CNY. As we went through our food, we couldn’t help but feel we were being rushed, prompted several times whether it was fine to clear the table, even when there was still a lot of food on the plates. At one point, we were asked twice in a span of five minutes. It was just 9:47pm then, so I just had to ask what time the place was closing. Apparently, last order was 9:45pm, though no one had checked with us, and they said that closing time would be 11pm. Right after that, I heard the word “FASTER” spoken out loudly from somewhere across the room, from the direction of the other wait-staff. Closing was one hour away then, but despite that we still tried to finish up fast, since the rest of the staff was rushing around us and clearing up, with the loud clattering of utensils and glass so overtly disturbing. Here’s the real clincher. About a minute after we asked for the check, one of the wait-staff several meters away, hidden from our view, makes this mock-announcement so loud that it was audible throughout the entire empty restaurant: “Excuse me everyone, an announcement please, table 107 has asked for the check”. And then silence. At this point, I could not help it. I stood up, walked about twenty steps over to where they were standing, and took issue. I said that I “over-heard” the big announcement they just made (how could I not!) , and wanted to confirm whether they were indeed referring to us. I was definitely trying to suppress indignation now, and when they said yes I just had to suggest that perhaps I can help them by also announcing loudly once I’ve paid. That way, everyone can go home early. All I got then were embarrassed looks and a mad scrambling about. The manager who was now standing right beside me, tried to make small talk, but seemed not to understand what was going on. The person who made the loud announcement (Stephanie, if I recall her name correctly, though I am not certain now) just walked about and said nothing, as she handed me the bill for signing – no apologies or the sort. We finally signed the bill and walked out by 10pm. Our server tried to quietly hand me a discount voucher --- I handed it back. Some things just aren’t about money. I did receive one apology--- from one of wait-staff, one who did not seem to have been involved, but who recognized us from previous visits. But the damage was done, and our entire dining experience was a total loss.No quality of food, no matter how good, and at whichever price, is ever worth going through that kind of treatment. All we wanted was a nice, special new year’s dinner, instead we got only stress, and indigestion, at a pricey expense. If they weren’t willing to serve customers that night, they should not have taken reservations, nor stayed open in the first place. Perhaps arrogance is getting the best of them.My rating for this Lawry’s experience is a big and bold “NOT WORTH IT”. Until we hear differently again about their service, we will be exploring, and sharing, our experiences of the many other superb steak places in Singapore

Visited with my 19-year-old son on January 28, 2014 at 12 noon. Perhaps we didn't have a prior reservation which was why we were given a table at a horrible location when most of the tables by the window were not occupied. This was near the Chinese New Year period and I don't envisage the place to be fully booked for lunch; anyway we sat down and expected the same good service from Lawry's such as the one we have experienced from our many visits to their previous venue at Paragon Orchard and we were not disappointed (other than being given a "lousy" table). The prime rib - we each ordered the second-largest cut, the Lawry cut - was as expected superbly delicious and tasted so good, the Yorkshire pudding was a great complement to the meat. Lawry's prides itself of its spinning salad, which in my opinion, is nothing but a showy presentation best reserved for impressionable rednecks from duck country, and does nothing to the salad. It was embarrassing to sit through it and watch the waitress doing her stuff with something we do much better ourselves at home, ie, putting together an edible, fresh, crisp, salad. One other thing: the bread came much later - "We're still baking it" we were told. Well. Don't restaurateurs prepare ahead of their opening at lunch? Or was it yet another showmanship stunt to convince clueless diners that each table's bread is being baked freshly and exclusively for that table? The shrimp cocktail was satisfying but we've eaten fresher, crunchier shrimps - this is one dish that Lawry's certainly must relook at - how far wrong can shrimp cocktail be? The trick is to use really, really fresh shrimps. Overall, an experience that was nice, except for the poor location of our table. And yes, the shrimps; oh, also please drop that act with the spinning salad. And since I'm on a roll, why clothe your waitresses that way? I mean, if the intention is to make them look at maids from the deep south of the cotton belt, at least don't use brown
3
I only remember the waitresses were made to wear an awful outfit & the salad was impressive...all that effort just to marinate the vegetables

We walked into the restaurant on 31 December 2013 at about 7pm and asked for a reservation. As expected, the restaurant was fully booked. However, they asked that we leave behind our name and contact number and if there were guests who did not turn up for their reservation, they would call us. True enough, we got a table that night. The ambience is great. With servers wearing party hats, and the restaurant well decorated with New Year's mood, we felt excited. There were 8 different dishes for the dinner and a free bottle of nice-tasting champagne accompanied our dinner. The beef steak was simply awesome, I had it done medium-rare.The servers were courteous. They were professionally in serving. We had a memorable evening even if we were set back by S$200/pax that night.We strongly recommend diners to try this restaurant even during normal evenings
4
Had afternoon tea there just a week ago. Service was prompt and pleasant. The Creme Bur-lee was a bit too sweet. The restaurant put strong emphasizes on the venue decoration and the staff's uniform. But, the continuing chit chat among staff members in front of patrons should always be avoided. If they have to discuss something, do it quietly or in another room. Hope they could improve on this one.............
3
It was the first week of the year so decided to have lunch at Lawry's Hoping that the business crowd was still away. Ordered to California cut. The service was very professional you can tell that the service were all trained. Price wise, it was Singapore so I as expecting it to be more than the other Lawry's I have tried in California and Tokyo. It's probably a place you need to try at least once unless you are a prime rib fanatic
4
First visit to Lawry. Of course the 3 of us order the steaks as our main course. We also went for the scallops and baked/fresh oysters and I must say that these are equally good. Overall a very good dining experiences. But the drawback is the pricing but will go back again
4
I'm a rib eye kind of guy but their prime rib was great that I actually liked it. The creamed spinach felt like mush though but the compliments like the pudding was okay and the mashed potatoes were good
4
Lawry's first opened in California in 1938. Their branch in Singapore is at level 4 at the Mandarin Gallery on Orchard road.The quality of service is excellent from the moment you enter to the time you leave. The menu has a few other dishes but as the name suggests, the main food is Prime Rib. The meat is brought alongside the table in a cooking trolley and the chef carves it for you. You can choose your cut and how you'd like it done. They have a thin cut, slices, or the popular Lawry's cut or an extra thick cut if you're hungry.The Prime Rib is served with their signature spinning salad, mashed potatoes and gravy, with a portion of Yorkshire pudding.My meal got better as I ate. The salad was ok, the Prime Rib was good and the dessert was very good (I had the traditional Bread pudding)The restaurant has 5 private dining rooms one of which seats 18 guests

If you have a big appetite, you'll like it! I went here twice during my last business trip to Singapore, both times getting the diamond Joe steak. Great beef, lovely yorkshire pudding and delicious potato! Recommended! I also enjoyed the lobster tails
4
Super ambience and great food, but the price? The bill came as a mighty shock to our group of 8 after just one course each, brilliant though it was. Go prepared
4
I have never tried Lawry's before as the place seem to be on the fine dining side but decided to give it a try for my boyfriend's birthday. Went there during weekday lunch as we took a day off, turned out to be a great decision. The ambiance was great with xmas decors nicely done, friendly servers greeted us and paid attention throughout the meal. Food was excellent, their power lunch set lunch menu was worth it, it was only $52 before tax for three course meal (compared to the usual ala carte), but the meal itself was accompanied with so many side dishes like yorkshire pudding, mashed, salad, bread. We left the restaurant so full,we can hardly walk! I'm planning to bring my family here for christmas already
4
I got experience to taste the delicious Lawry's prime ribs in Singapore during my business trip. Love the food, it was delicious and i hope i can get back to Singapore just for have lunch or dinner at this place. I was looking for the same restaurant in Hong Kong, but it was closed due to renovation. You can taste the other style of steak with delicious salad and bread.. :) Just amazing
5
Having raved about the place I finally got the chance to take my wife along and she wasn't disappointed. Three medium sized lobster halves for her while I got my usual steak with hollandaise sauce. Very fast service, attentive staff, and an excellent meal. Will definitely be going back
5
It had been a good 5 years since we went Lawry's for dinner. However, our recent dining experience with them was just as amazing as it was before. Perhaps, even better. It was my father in law's 73rd Birthday and we had a memorable meal and service. The manager, Imran, served us diligently and led the team with confidence. The staff served us with a smile and sang the 'happy birthday' song at least 6 times that night, each as enthusiastically as before.I had the festive cut which was of perfect doneness (photograph attached) while my fiance had the diamond cut of the meat which he enjoyed thoroughly. The birthday boy's rack of lamb was perfectly crusted with bread crumbs and full of flavour.Although the mushroom sizzler was rather bland, the presentation for their signature spinning bowl salad was entertaining and the taste, refreshing.Lawry's is definitely THE place to have your celebrations, regardless of birthdays or anniversary
4
It's been a while since I've been to Lawry's. The last time was before they moved to Mandarin Gallery. Thankfully the experience is still as great as before. Food was just as good and the presentation was top notch.Lawry's signature salad is great, the steaks are just as good as their prime ribs.Highly recommended for birthdays, anniversaries and group dinners
5
I love the local food in Singapore but had a business dinner and wanted to bring my clients to something different. It has been a few years since I have gone to a Lawry's and thought they would enjoy the food and "carving" experience. It was a HUGE success. The food and service we amazing. They have this elaborate carving cart they bring to the table and prepare your prime rib in front of you. It is a lot of fun to watch. The meat was unbelievable and literally melts in your mouth and the creamed spinach was the best I have ever tried. Lately, I have been to quite a few top quality steak restaurants and I far prefer Lawry's. Is a great place to go with with friends or the family. The guy who was sitting next to us was celebrating his birthday and the staff sang a great version of HB to him and gave him a nice looking birthday cake
5
It was my first, and I am craving for my next visit.Great service, great food, great experience. The Foie Gras was superb - highly recommend it. Looking forward to my next visit.

This is one of those restaurants that you've never heard of before, but if you're in for the perfect steak, the Lawry's in Orchard, Singapore might be it. Great experience from the moment we enter, cheerful waiters and waitresses serving food with passion and a big smile on their faces. Even if they have to pretend, at least their acting skills are almost on par with Hollywood. I ordered the classic Lawry's medium rare steak and it was the world's most excellent piece of beef ever. The juiciness and the tenderness of the meat was cooked to perfection, and of course served with more smiles from friendly ladies and gentlemen. My partner also enjoyed the experience and the food as much as I did. It was a lot of food and money well spent. It seems like everything was perfect, but....One thing that sort of ticked me off was the fact that they were rushing us to finish our food as it was approach closing time. As I mentioned, it was a lot of food, and granted, we came slightly later than most guests that evening, but we were first time customers. For a lot of money and great food, we should be given the liberty to enjoy the food until we are fully satisfied. One of the guys looked visibly upset and the worst thing was we were constantly reminded that they had to close. I was enjoying my steak so what did they expect? To leave my food behind, pay the bill and walk away? Even with their fake big smiles, at least continue that great customer service until the end and especially until the first time customer is fully satisfied. It's not easy, but no one said the restaurant business was easy to begin with. So if I had to complain, this would be it, but otherwise keep up the good work, Lawry's. We might just visit a Lawry's in another country

THE GOODThe rib roast was absolutely delicious, succulent and I had the Jim Brady to satiate my appetite. Side dishes failed to impress.The decor and the table separations were good.THE LACKLUSTREThe atmosphere was lacking, sterile.At Morton's, they do it the American way, even a local Indian waitstaff would recommend their steak with great aplomb, and he would be engaging in his interactions with the diners at appropriate intervals.At Lawry's, I got a rehearsed show of the Spinning Bowl Salad, and polite service. Even the "Master Carver" appeared shy, had "no personality", failed to engage the diner, a failed opportunity.I ate quietly, paid up, went on my way. Mortons was engaging, it makes me want to go back there. Lawrys .. you are too steril
4
Formal style fine wine dinning with romantic ambience. Right from its entrance will already be able to put visitors in the mood. Excellent place to take a date whom you wish to impress. Been to this place 3 times total, love all the 3 experiences. I rarely take beef due to religion and upbringing but my ex (first person who take me there) highly recommended its prime rib and I really like it after trying. Ordered it 3 times during my 3 visits, tried lawry’s cut but prefer english cut more. Spinning salad, mashed potato and pudding that come with the prime rib are great but not really extraordinary. I tried the mushroom scallops, minestrone soup and baked oyster too but will only recommend its prime rib and maybe mushroom scallops too. The other dish are great but doesn’t justify their price tag. In fine dinning point of view these dish are great enough but I’ve eaten better taste similar dishes at much cheaper places so naturally will compare the quality vs value. As all 3 visits are for dinner, I really wishes to try their high tea in future. I remember on my first visit my ex ordered some hot chocolate with ice cream type of dessert and it taste just heavenly so I believe their dessert must be really good. Have not ordered any dessert as i don’t want to scare my date (who is paying) away or put on weight

We had made a reservation at Lawry's for 8:30 pm, and we were shown to a romantic table for two in a corner with huge windows on either side. Lawry’s is on the fourth floor of Mandarin Gallery, so our table overlooked the pedestrians of busy Orchard Road and the huge H&M sign on the building across the street. We could see that there was a whole row of tables for two along the windows facing Orchard Road, so there is a good chance of getting a window table. The warm rolls were tasty. The server starts by asking if you want sparkling or still water, but you can order tap water which tastes the same to us as water from the bottles of Equil that they serve for SGD 7++. Their wine list was extensive enough so that we could order a glass of sweet late harvest wine that was very good. We felt that Lawry's does prime rib best, so we shared a tender and sweet Lowry's cut (285 gr) of prime rib, and they added an order of mashed potatoes to match the roast beef. It was swimming in juice which we soaked up with Yorkshire pudding. They served two kinds of horseradish. Although the portions filled us up, we could not resist ordering the crepes Suzette which was prepared on a cart next to our table. The lady used many oranges and a lemon. After she made the sauce and put the crepes on the plate, she added banana slices. We could not taste the alcohol that was flamed, and we didn’t feel the banana slices added to the flavor. Neither the sauce nor the crepes were the best we have tasted, but they were very good. The high point of the crepes Suzette was the vanilla ice cream on the side which was good and plentiful (often it is not). The staff were well trained and very helpful. Our servers all were very charming Filipinas. They graciously provided a 10% discount for guests of the Mandarin Orchard hotel, and another 5% for paying directly to Lowry's. That brought the price down to a reasonable level. We felt that the whole experience was excellent, and the food was very good
4
I wanted to go to Lawry's as it is a favorite of mine in the US and I haven't been in a few years. The menu was very similar to the one in the US with a few additions. Ambiance was great, food was great although I felt like portion sizes were smalerl than I was used to in the US.
2
We dropped in here last minute after a long day on Monday. The staff found us a table by the window and were very attentive. We looked at the menu and realised that it wasn't going to be a cheap 'Monday night meal'. That didn't bother us as we love our food and don't mind paying for great quality. This is sadly where the problem lies with Lawry's. The quality of the food didn't match the price or the expectations. My girlfriend ordered the Fillet Mignon and asked for it to be cooked rare. I expect any chef who puts steak on the menu to be able to cook it properly but understand that some people can get it wrong. However, when the price is $73 for it I expect it to be bang on. It wasn't. It was overlooked. It was still a lovely piece of beef but not worth the price. They had tried to make it showy in the way it was presented but infact looked a bit naff with one piece of carrot, a piece of lemon (no idea why) and a piece of broccoli all stuck on individual forks attached to a strange rack around the plate. I ordered the ribs which whilst tasty were again not mind blowing and didn't justify the the hefty price tag. The BBQ sauce was ok and I'm convinced the coleslaw was bought in and not freshly made. This is a restaurant that sells sides separately so unless you want just some meat you have to buy them to go with it. Or so we thought. My girlfriend ordered the baked potato to go with her steak and I ordered the same for my ribs as neither said they came with anything on the menu. Imagine my surprise when on my plate was a healthy portion of fries! I would have expected the staff to have pointed that out to me as I was ordering just in case I wasn't aware of it and didn't need to spend the extra $13. The potato was again ok but I didn't think it was properly cooked and was a bit lumpy. I also found having my food put in front of me and then having to watch two waitresses cut open our potatoes and put all the extras on it for us to be not only unnecessary but in fact a pain as we were hungry and our food was going cold in front of us.We will not be returning here and would urge others to seriously reconsider if they are thinking about it. There are fair better places to eat in Singapore that offer far better food and better value for money

I got a complete satisfaction when visiting Lawry's.I made my reservation by email, and received an immediate warm welcome confirmation.I ordered the Lawry's cut Prime Ribs. The steak was really wonderful, tasty, tender, and juicy.Even though I am not a big fan of salad, I must acknowledge that it's nice, with the flavorful salad dressing. The side dish of Yorkshire pudding portion was very generous, and delicious as well.Service is another excellent aspect, the staffs provided good & attentive services, from welcoming, taking order, and serving the meal. They even provided the guest with a free souvenir, a funny cattle doll wearing a chef outfit :)I can't wait to make another trip to Singapore, mainly to dine in this excellent restaurant
4
Enjoyed my time at Lawry's, the staff were attentive and professional from the moment I arrived until I left. The steak was cooked to perfection for me and the mash was really tasty, but the side salad was a bit measly and looked like a bit of an afterthought. The wine selection is good value
5
Lawry's is one of the places that I always go to when I am in Singapore. I have been there with friends, for business, and solo. This is one restaurant which has never disappointed. Never. The standard of excellence that they maintain is amazing. The ambience is wonderful, almost old school in a way. Without being old fashioned, it takes you to the days of subtle elegance, of refinementThis is something that is seen in the way that they serve the steaks and sides, to the decor, and to the way that they take your order. The steaks and sides are wonderful, and as I write this, my mouth waters, and I am tempted to take the first flight to Singapore for another wonderful meal at Lawry's, The Prime Rib.If you are a steak lover, this place is a must visit in Singapor
5
We reserved for dinner. We may very well be back. The food was incredible, the staff phenomenal, & the details made for an awesome experience.Everything was made for a memorable dinner. The staff was amazingly attentive - from service to refilling water, describing the menu, drink suggestions... the staff works as an amazing team and nothing is left unattended. I have paid more in New York for poor service and over-the-top food. The freshness, the flavours, the complexity yet simplicity was incredible.Go for dinner and you may never want to leave
5
A great steak and a great performance by the staff, particularly Yaya whose presentation was fantastic. The salad was a bit sparse this time but the meat and the mash more than made up for it
5
Had the most amazing piece of beef served with great theatre at Jewrys. Definitely a must now on future trips to Singapor
5
Whenever I go to Singapore, I always spare my time to eat lunch or dinner here. The first time, I tasted Lawry's is when I was in LA for my study. I always ate the Beverly Hills Lawry's once a month. I always had a "Lawry's Cut" with a bone in Medium, You could find it in Singapore a few years back, but now you couldn't find the Lawry's Prime Rib cut with a bone there "due to Singapore Regulation" said the Lawry's waiter. The way they cook the Prime Rib so precise, tender, tasty and so sumptuous.The Service is excellent, please ask the waiter to put extra chopped eggs on the salad, so delicious. My recommendation is don't order nothing else rather than the Prime Rib.Pricewise, is a bit pricey but it's worth it and you can have a 10% discount for foreigners.Bon apetit'
4
I was after a good steak and wasn't disappointed. The prime rib includes a salad and mashed potato and it was an excellent meal. Service is very good - I was even offered a chilled fork for the salad. A bit pricey, and if you're after a well done steak dont order the prime rib, but otherwise a very good meal
5
My daughter booked this place to celebrate my birthday. Went there with my wife, daughter and ny future son in law. The ambience is classy and the service impeccable. The Lawry's cut, medium rare, taste wonderful, almost melting in your mouth. The portion is also very generous. The lobster tail did not disappoint either. Overall, the prices are a bit steep, but for the overall experience to celebrate a special occassion, it is worth it. Also they gave a generous discount for my daughter who happens to be a member of SIA's airline crew. Smart marketing move on their part
5
We had eaten at all the Lawry's in the US, and looked forward to trying this one in Singapore. It did not disappoint. The ambience, service, and food were the equal of anywhere else. Had an excellent meal and a nice table for two at a third story window, overlooking the busy street below. Prices were high, just like most everywhere else in SG. Highly recommended. Reservations a must
5
Patronised the restaurant with my son and his girlfriend last Fri. We haven't been there for quite a while but nothing has changed - the roast beef is just as tender and succulent if not better. Service was impressive and we met the GM Henry Quah who came by periodically to check on how we were faring to make our dining experience truly memorable
5
Had birthday celebration for my wife and son. Impressive preparation of roast beef, amazingly professional service. Flawless exprerience
5
It would be so easy for this to feel like a formulaic experience, but whilst one knows that there is indeed a formula being applied, the experience is made unique by the astonishing attentiveness of the service..rather like the dining equivalent of Singapore Airlines!Tables are perfectly space for a business dinner, but it was a bit distracting to have the staff breaking out in "Happy Birthday" refrains every few minutes! I was told that there are on average 4 or 5 birthday dinners each evenin

The Steak is legendary and i have to admit that it is quite good, at least in Singapore. The Tenderloin is succulent and i would recommend to ask for Medium or Medium Rare. The side dishes are pretty good too but you have to order the steak when u are here. The decor is boring though everything is well organised and the service is attentive. However, since it sells itself as a mid to high priced formal dinning restaurant, you have to watch your manners and etiquette while eating here. Not that the staff would chide you off but they might clear your plates before u are actually done with the food if you place your cutlery incorrectly
3
The service does seem to be the key here. I am betting that the servers have to memorize a script as they perform the same routine with the exact same words at each and every table which for me left it feeling more like a rehearsed show than true personal service. The world famous salad actually did not have a great taste, just okay dressing although the lettuce was nice and crisp. My husband says that the prime rib also was just okay, way too much gristle for the price. The mashed potatoes were delicious and the gravy was also very good, but that is not enough to justify the cost of the meal. All in all for the price you pay, I would be more impressed to get great food rather than great service. I am vegetarian and ordered a soup ($10) and baked potato ($13) and both were okay. I did not expect much after all this is a prime rib restaurant. My husband had the lawry cut ($88) and had to pay extra to get cream corn with his meal. The meal is served with a Yorkshire pudding which we had never had before but did not care for at all and did not eat. We each had one drink and our total was $165

First off, this is NOT a steakhouse as prime rib is NOT and NEVER WILL BE steak. Prime rib is roast beef, not steak in general or a ribeye steak in particular. And as far as prime rib goes, this is as good as it gets in Singapore or nearly anywhere else. If you're from the U.S. and want a taste of back home after all the local cuisine, you really can't go wrong with the prime rib. Yes, they make a production out of the pouring of the salad dressing but it's been done this way since the 1930's so just go with the flow. The service is always friendly and the beef, with the au jus, is always tasty. I go there alone and with Singaporean work colleagues who are always impressed - and most of them had no clue what prime rib was before we went. One other thing, having sampled many of the cuts of prime rib, I recommend the English Cut as it really brings out the flavor in the beef. And don't forget the creamed spinach

In Singapore once again and staying at the Mandarin we found Lawrys just behind the hotel.Fantastic place, I reserved for 6 persons and we were given a private dining room,great as we had to children with us .The service is of the "old fashioned ' kind, in other words cheerful,caring and wonderful.The food ,I could go on and on.Try anything and you will be sated.Best place for service and food that I have ever been and I love food and have been all over.Please support this wonderful restaurant ,not many of this kind exist anymore ,sadly
5
I wouldn't normally choose this type of place to eat when in another country(prefer to try local cuisine), but my US work colleagues were keen to go. The service was extremely good and the food just terrific. If you want top quality beef,this is your place
5
I love their prime rib ! We always go there in every occasion (or even if we don't have any occasion to celebrate !) We always order the english cut and it was simply amazing ! we can't get enough of this.
5
It was a amazing experience, incredible food amazing service, we really had a great time.Had Crab cakes as starter, amazing taste, really loved the crab cakes, after that had salad, which was very very nice, dressing was superb.Main course I ordered was Salmon, not a beef eater so had to go for fish, but others in the group went for Beef and were very happy with the quality of meat.I would highly recommend this place, it a bit pricey but worth the money
5
Nothing else i can say.. it has always been my favorite fine dining restaurant since i was young. every thing you try will be PERFEC
5
Good food, excellent service by very professional staff all very capably lead by Mr Imran. We’ll be back. Soon
5
The food was great! Had California cut for my wife and I had steak. Preferred the prime ribs though... Overall, a great place to impress your date or to celebrate an important occasion with ur loved ones
3
This was interesting. Very high end prices, excellent service, but underneath, very ordinary food.The famous spinning salad was a complete nonsense of performing art as some poor waitress poured a fairly ordinary dressing over some iceberg lettuce and claimed it was famous.The prime rib was a decent bit of pub food roast beef, but no more. Everything else was OK.The night was almost saved by the great staff and almost ruined by the huge bill
5
This was our first visit to this restaurant. Welcome and service were outstanding. The staff is well trained in every respect. The wine butler handled the wine professionally. The food was excellent - especially the beef. Atmosphere is fairly formal and many patrons seem to be celebrating their birthday in this restaurant - with about 6 ''singing sessions'' alone during our dinner. We can recommend this restaurant
5
Visiting Lawry's The Prime Rib in Singapore is always a very pleasurable experience. The staff are always very friendly and very attentive. Occasionally the need to do somethings from a clearly scripted communication can be a bit false but that is one of the pillars that the Global operation is based on.Their beef is always well presented and it is possible to choose the type of cut you would like and how well, or not, you would like it cooked. Where they really excel is with their Yorkshire Puddings. I am on record as saying that I think they are the best in the World and that includes Sunday lunch in some 5 star hotels in London. We usually manage to get a 2nd one between us.Lawry's also has a very impressive wine list, which goes from very affordable cheaper bottles up to high end vintage and bin specials. I would describe the overall price as mid range. It is certainly not the cheapest meal you can get in Singapore but neither is is high end fine dining. There are many restaurants that will cost considerably more. It is a credit to the restaurant that in a fast moving, changing city like Singapore it has survived and successfully changed locations.We have been regular diners there, when we are in Singapore, since it opened some years ago and we have never been let down or disappointed. I also like their use of social media and the creative ways they build and maintain their customer database
5
I had gone to Lawry's before, and filled out one of their cards so they knew when my birthday was. They sent me a coupon ahead of time, and so I went to Lawry's during the month of my birthday. The coupon was a great deal and I felt really spoiled. As a bonus, I got a nice gift because we spent above a certain amount. We had a great time, I think the combination of the holidays and my birthday made it super special.We were seated at a table in the back -- I think next time we'd request to be in the front because there's a better view of Orchard Road, but I think they were a full house
5
Great place.. service is outstanding. Price is high but, all high end Steak joints are... Dress nice and enjoy the night... Don't fret over the bill... just know it's going to be $$$$$.... I've eaten here 4-5 times... always great food.
5
to me lawrys has a delicate western style cuisine their California cut would be enough to fill your belly. i especially liked their cold appetiser salad served with what i think is lawrys "secret sauce" or either just ceased dressing. but i really loved their salad especially when eaten immediately. their sweet corn would be a suggestion in your dressing of the steak. the service there is friendly and fast. i always look forward whenever i have a business trips in singapore as there lawrys taste better than the lawrys in my home countr
4
Nice restaurant with good service!Food excellent and promotions are great.Beef are cooked till perfect texture with nice side dishes.Will def visit the restaurant again
5
Was there for our anniversary celebration and i'm touched that the staff did an extra mile to serve us desserts (on the house) and took a picture for us! As I was pregnant, the staff was very attentive towards my needs and even asked if i require any extra cushioning for my back. Food serving was more than sufficient and of course, I love the food!! will definitely go back there again. :)
1
Years ago my husband and I paid a visit to Lawry's for dinner. The ambiance was tacky - and most of all they played the Gypsy Kings on and on and on which really did not suit the décor of the place. The fan fare for the salad was very very amusing. The food was awful. We have never wanted to venture back since
5
Great beef, good wine list, excellent location in the Mandarin gallery, faultless service. A bit pricey but worth it
5
You won't hardly find good affordable beef in Singapore so when you feel like beef just know you will pay for it. Lawry's is consistently superb
5
good food. nice staff. good atmosphere. the best steak house in SG in think.but not easy too book online
2
I don't understand what's so good about Lawry's. I like the interior, it's classy. But the steak? It's not my definition of steak and it's pricey. I tried to find good things in the steak, believe me I tried but I couldn't find anything.The waitress come to you and cut a slice of steak for you. I thought steak is supposed to be sliced first and then you cook it? And that makes the steak not so hot when they serve it. The steak is wet with sauce. Since they slice it after cooking, the inner part of the meat is exposed (refer to pictures if you don't understand me) so you only get a handful of crispy burnt side from the sides. Worse, they pour over sauce over the steak. Sighhh... Nothing excites me here. Not the potato or creamy corn or whatever
5
Shiva is really great :D the food is really nice.. The service is really good.. The waiters are really friendly.

Walking down Orchard St looking for a lunch place we came across this appareny very upmarket american steakhouse chain - i beg your pardon!! - errr... Well i dont know how to call it differeny really. Ok the food is very well prepared but extremely traditional. An English grandma, a very talented one in admit, cooks this way. Unfortunately they cant run the restaurant without overmarketing it in the anglosaxon way, so we were presented the Famous Spinning Salad bowl, which basically means a spinning bowl of salad where the waitress poured a very normal thousands islands dressing from 3 ft above as if it were maroccan tea. There was nothing very interesting or creative in the salad, as in the whole menu, but it was very fresh. The beef was of course excellent and the veggies very old school but very nice. My glass of 2006 aussi grenache was excellent. Creme brulee for dessert, decent job but honestly not above most creme brulees you would get in any randomly picked restaurant in France and most of all once again no new ideas. For a would be posh place the middle of the road 80s music was misplaced. Anyway a very nice lunch without too much culinary pretention, the bill of 256 SIN$ for 2 adults and 2 child menus was definitely the spiecest item on the table...

I was looking for a special restaurant to celebrate my wife and I's 28th anniversary, checked several choices (via tripadvisor :), and talked with a savvy restaurant relative in the family. Lawry's The Prime Rib was my choice. After downloading their app onto my iPhone, I immediately received a 1-for-1 dinner (good for Mon-Fri dinners), and got a menu from their app. From the time I reserved a dinner for two, with special requests (champagne and black forest cake) to the time we walked out of the restaurant, it was a relaxing, reassuring, and extremely enjoyable dinner. The restaurant called to confirm our reservation, notified me that they did not service black forest cake, but would they would welcome our own cake without any problem.Our table had an excellent view over Orchard Road, the service was personable thanks to Virgo's friendly demeanor, the salad was (literally) tossed in front of us, the cuts of rib were there to choose from, both part of the rib, as well as the degree of cooking it, and lighting set the tone for us to enjoy the meal and each other. They took a picture in a special 'Lawry's' frame, and called us after we'd left to remind us we'd forgotten our camera. We plan to return. We would suggest buying the drinks by the glass, as the cost of the bottle of champagne was about the price of the dinner, unless you want to splurge a bit. Overall, we highly recommend Lawry's The Prime Rib, Singapore, as a restaurant (for beef-lovers) to remember-and-enjoy that special person on that occasion they so richly deserve
4
Nice ambience, a bit crazy costumes of the personel. Slightly overpriced but serving great meat. Be careful not to order still water (costs 7 SGD per small bottle). Ask for ice water (it is free) and you won't spot the difference
4
We've been to the Lawry's in Beverly Hills and Las Vegas before. I'm going to compare it to my experience there. The food in Singapore tastes exactly like what you'd get in the U.S. The restaurant has done a good job maintaining food quality and consistency. The decor and the Lawry's traditions (chilled fork, spinning salad) has also been maintained.Service, however, was not up to par. We were definitely swerving our heads looking for wait staff that could help us. Here's one example: we ordered a sparkling water. I saw the sparkling water come, but the waiter didn't know to serve it to us. He just stood several feet away, looking lost, and went and came back several times. Two things that reflect poor service : 1) Why didn't he know our table number to serve us water? This seems pretty basic. 2) I was looking directly at him -- if he just looked around, I would have nodded, and he would have known it was our table. (In fact, I even raised my hand, but he wasn't looking at the tables.) In general, the wait staff weren't proactive about service -- flagging someone always took a while. It wasn't *terrible* service, it was just not up to the Lawry's standards in U.S.Also, in U.S. if you finish your prime rib, they ask you if you'd like an extra thin slice to make you full. Here they didn't.I would still return to the restaurant, as I said -- service wasn't terrible, just not quite there for the price you're paying. (They have a good promotion by downloading an iphone app, that thankfully didn't need a credit card, because I never have the right credit card). However, if I was visiting Singapore from the U.S., I would not recommend this place because it would be better to get the real experience in the U.S
5
We experienced excellent personal service from staff also good food. Very satisfying meal indeed. We highly reccommend Lawry's
4
I went for the Afternoon Indulgence set ($15) today and found the experience quite pleasant.My hubby ordered the Prime Rib Yorkshire Roll Up - something like using a sheet of pan-fried egg to wrap sliced beef. Pretty savoury and Lawry's very generous with the beef. It would be a filling dish for a small to average/medium eater.The Cajun Chicken Salad is one of the better ones that I have tasted in Singapore so far - the greens are very crunchy and fresh. With each bite, the bursts of juices also bring subtle sweetness. After the salad, I felt very 'detoxed' and satisfied.I would rate the pudding below average though. I tasted one in a shophouse in Little India last week and I thought it was better. Lawry's pudding is a tad too wet, and almost too 'sticky' and 'chewy'. Er... I would not order it again.I very much prefer the brownie (compared to the pudding). Lawry's brownie is not too coyingly sweet and the bits of pistachios sprinkled over it provided an extra 'crunchy' taste. Maybe I would rate it 6/10; I find the scoop of ice-cream too miserable and insufficient to satisfy my sweet tooth.Special mention about Lawry's artisan tea!! I chose the Peach Nectar as the waitress strongly recommended it. Frankly, I am not a huge fan of peaches (especially its smell). Hence, I took a gamble and selected it anyway. When the tea arrived in a pretty pot, I found the tea and teapot setup very 'aesthetically' pleasing. The tea is a pretty yellow hue and its fragrant only hinted at a tinge of peach (not the super overpowering kind). The tea is sweet even without any additional sugar and I like the refreshing feel that it leaves me.Overall quite a good deal for $15

Finally decided to try this place one day , after hearing years of great reviews whilst it was at Paragon. Think we had a 1 for 1 promotion from some credit card. Cant really recall which bank, but the offer is always available.Service wise, was EXCELLENT.Everyone there were fantastic. Ever polite, ever ready to give you good service. You can feel the difference in ambience and treatment the moment you step in. I enjoyed the way they prepared the spinning ice bowl salad, served with a chilled fork. The salad was delicious. It seems every thing was prepared with much detailed and care. We had a Lawry's cut and a Lobster. Lobster was pretty average, size was small i would say. As for the beef, i would actually expect much better quality for the price that it was selling at. . Whichever choice of beef you order, it will be cut / set infront of you from a push cart. You can imagine how large the cart was, with the beef and the accompaniments and the plates all in the cart. Overall, i would say for the price you pay, the food quality could be better, I had tasted better elsewhere. Service was definitely top-notch. Would recommend that if you have some vouchers, or 1-for-1 deal, then it would be reasonable to dine here
5
I have been coming to Lawry's for every birthday and every celebration because the food is good and the service is excellent. The ambience is always splendid. I highly recommend any one to come here if they wish to have good beef and have a birthday celebration as well. They even have a photo of your birthday celebration which they will email to you and give you a table copy. The staff are friendly and very pleasant
4
I was craving some roast beef and this hit the spot. Expensive but if you have never tried a Lawry's experience you should.
5
Excellent all around - world class prime rib, attentive service in line with Lawry's global standards, and very well appointed dining room. Perfect for special occasions.
3
The facade was very welcoming. Service was exceptional. One staff named Virgo stood out with his excellent knowledge of the product. I was happy with my choice of Fish of The Day (Threadfin). Would definitely come back for more dining experience with family and friends.
5
Seen many of the reviews and I guess majority are cheap Charlie's. iF u can afford it..... Get a private room. Service is impeccable. Salad was super tasty. Yokeshire pud is yummy and the meats are excellent. Best dining experience ever
4
I am a hotelier and still awed by perfect service. Food is expensive but very delicious. A good choice for my anniversary dinner. Ambience is good and romantic. :)

I went to Orchard and saw a huge red escalator poster with lawry's executive set lunch menu from $38 at Mandarin Gallery. I thought it will be a tasting portion or something because they dont have anything like this the last time I dined here during december last year. the set is 2-course lunch, but no joke the portion was big! They served you a warm bread and their original salad then I ordered their prime rib for main course. I couldnt even order dessert for myself, but since my husband is a dessert person we shared their panna cotta (dessert and coffee/tea is additional $10). it was a good and satisfying lunch. Their servers are the most friendly and attentive of all. I'll bring my family next time
4
I really love the spinning bowl salad which is unique and well done (the way how the waitress did it looked like those you saw in the old UK movies). The foie gras is rather tasty, though a bit salty. The chicken is also very good, would be even better if it could be served boneless. I did not have the beef, as it looked like it was rather raw. A wide range of desserts also available for selection, the cheese cake is delicious. The mud pie looks very mouth-watering. The dark chocolate is a perfect way to end your meal. The room has very special original paintings from Britain, and is perfect for family occasions, where you want some privacy all to yourself
4
Went along with my family to celebrate a birthday - staff were very attentive from the booking - asked if we were celebrating anything, adrressed us by name and took time to explain the menu and even took a photo and printe dit out as a souvenir.But the prices are breathtaking! Four of us had the Lawry's cut @ $88 each, 2 side dishes of creamed spinach @ $8 each - two soft dinks, one red wine, one cocktail and three desserts - GST and Service charge.. almost $600!!The food was really great and the staff are adorable in their cute outfits, all very well trained and attentive and professional so I guess you get what you pay for..but will have to save up before we ever go back
5
This is a very memorable restaurant well located on Ocrhard Road. The anmbience of the place is a delight with traidtional uniforms and wonderful silver service.The spinning bowl salad is unique and well done. The focus of the restaurant is the wonderful steaks whcih are carved in a great silver container (like a huge Weber) and then served with accompaniments.Well recommended for the great service, ambience and the wonderful food
5
For those who appreciate having an excellent taste of beef , you must not pass the opportunity of having a meal at Lawrys Singapore Restaurat located at The Mandarin Singapore Shopping Gallery 4th floor . Their Lawrys Cut Roast Beef is value for money and tastes superb melting in your mouth 
5
Upon reservation, I mentioned that I will be there with a friend to celebrate a Birthday so I requested for a window seat with a nice view. However, there was high reservation on that night thus, we were seated in a private dining room with tables seperated. The hostess was friendly and apologise that she was unable to secure a window seat for us. When seated down, the hostess informed us that there was an in-house promotion - 50% off 2nd main course ordered which was a good gift for us as we were unaware of the promotion. I know that there will be an English Trifle Cake for birthday celebration and I told them to serve the cake from behind so that my friend will be surprised. The hostess remembered and the waitresses acted accordingly, singing us a birthday song. The atmosphere was relaxing and it indeed was a great place to celebrate his birthday and to savour good roasted beef! We signed up for the Birthday Club membership to be in the loop of Lawry’s happening and to enjoy more birthday promotions. Keep up the good work Lawry’s and I will be back for more beef
4
went on a romantic date, it was ok. the food wasn't what i expected, but it was delicious and enjoyable.
5
Just a simple prime rib (roast beef to Brits) roasted the way you want it served with creamy mash and unlimited Yorkshire puddings and gravy. Spicy or creamy horseradish also. Doesn't come much better. Very attentive service also.
5
We had a wonderful mothers day lunch at lawrys today. Great food and wine and the kids loved their special menu too! Bravo lawrys!
2
From the outside it looks the part but the food is disappointing and the service sloppy.
5
We had steak there and it was perfect, they make the special salad for you at your table, service is good and they make the steak exactly as you want it. Compare service, food and price and it is ok.
4
Even from outside,the smell of the mashed potatoes was so good...when I went inside,they nicely serve us and explained all details.very tasteful primeribs n also have any kind of wine.Such a wonderful restaurant.
3
Service below average. Food surely do not taste tastier than the money they collect from you. In short, not that great a place for dining. The roadside coffee shops cook up better meals than Lawrys. The money you save here can be well spent elsewhere
3
First time to Lawry's and will be our last. I am an American and a lover of prime rib and it was just average. For the past 7 years we have gone to Black Angus for prime rib but on my birthday we decided to try Lawry's and to say it was disapointing would be an understatement. In addition we were told that since it was my birthday, the second meal would be less 50%. That obviously did not happen and we had to call them to make the correction. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone expecting above average prime rib. There are better places in Singapore to enjoy prime rib at a better price
5
We've celebrated two special occasions already at Lawry's -- our wedding anniversary and Mother's Day, and every time, we enjoyed our dining experience, from the welcome we received at the reception, to the time we were seated, served, and done with our meal. The staff are courteous, cheerful, and attentive. The steaks are heavenly with the right flavor, texture, and succulence. The mashed potatoes are equally good! And the place is so conveniently located along Orchard
4
A slab of beef is every man's god given right, and for my taste, the best in Singapore is The Prime Rib at Lawry's. Add in gravy, Yorkshire pud, creamed spinach - I love this steak so much I made it a mix tape with all the songs we could enjoy together.They also have their 'famous' Spinning Salad, where the amusingly attired waitress will pour the dressing from a great height on to a bowl of salad, which is rotating at high speed. The real sign of the class of this restaurant is that you eat your salad WITH A CHILLED FORK. I never knew, all this time, I was eating my salads incorrectly. Room temperature forks are for peasants
5
We celebrated my wife's birthday at Lawry's on 7 Mar.
Thanks to William, Shirleen and team, we totally enjoyed our meal. It was a splendid dining experience and we will definitely be back for more!

Good fine dinning service, beef done right to your request, great for business lunches.
5
This is a place I take my overseas guests to whenever they feel like having steak - as we know that they serve quality steak and serve it well. The presentation of food is as good as it tastes!
5
The Beef Prime Rib is simply tender and delicious! The portion is pretty generous. Thumbs up.
By the way, the service is pretty good as well.
5
Staff at the restaurant took the trouble to explain what sauces goes best with which cuts. The steak and ribs were great tasting. Prices are quite a premium and most middle-income people will not dine there often.
5
I ate here for the first time last year, and I really enjoyed it. I was by myself on business. I have to say, the little ice salad spinning, salad dressing dance was the highlight. I've been telling friends about it for weeks, and I can't wait to go back to see the performance again. It is so quirky and charming at the same time. The food was quite good, and the atmosphere mature without being stuffy. A great place to eat. Go for the salad dressing dance, stay for the food
5
Even though it's moved across the road and now within a hotel, the new and chic interior just doesnt seem to compare with the slightly worn and classy feel of the restaurant when it used to be in paragon. Food was good, portion big and extremely filling. Lobster tails were nicely cooked to perfection - not too hard nor chewy. Service was very good though can be difficult to catch a waiter/waitress as they were full house even on a weekday night...but when you do catch one of them they attend to your request promptly
4
We have done lots of survey for quality ribs in town but mostly with fine dining. After reviewing comments and the picture of the food served, we decided to pay our 1st visit to the restaurant. They do have kids meal that certainly cheer up their night, especially the ice cream. The ribs are very good no doubt on that. The price is above average but the portion is big, so suggest you share if you are an average to small eater. Service level so..so.. the staffs are quite forgetful and not very attentive considering the price we pay. So is a pity
2
After giving a negative review on our last few trips, i was caught by surprised when the owner Mr Juan gave me a phone call & apologised profusedly & sincerely. He asked me to give him another chance with his better staff & also that the venue has already shifted to a new premise at Mandarin Arcade. The ambience was magnificent except for the ugly looking ladder leaning on the beautiful timber wall, staring at our table. All the waiting staff were excellent especially Celina & Manager William Chiam. These 2 were truly impeccable & deserved high praises. They were prompt, alert, full of initiatives, resourceful & courteous throughout our dinner, making the best of our dining experiences except for ... Someone appeared & spoilt our wow experience, a birthday occasion for my spouse. This man was bragging, aloof & talking down at us, Asian Chinese. He was the Regional GM. What a turn-off taste with the way he presented himself & carried a conversation with us in such tone & arrogance. It concluded with a boo-boo. We also like to thank Chef Nick & Mary Ann for their politeness & enthusiastic services. I'm supposed to celebrate my birthday this month in November but i drag going there with another disappointment. Fear of another let-down disappointment
5
Have your reservation done, have your birthday at Lawry's! Nice ambience, classy and excellent service. Of course the food is not cheap but you will not regret the delicious meal and time spent at this restaurant. When you are dining during your birthday month, Lawry's make sure you get a nice picture taken, and this time they immediately print it out and put it onto their Lawry's paper photo frame and also email the softcopy for your remembrance. The signature dish is the prime rib dinner - comes with the spinning bowl salad -- just watch and enjoy how the waitress spin your salad! Never goes wrong with Lawry's cut, if you can't make up your mind which type of cut you want. The rack of lamb is just juicy and delicious. This is not your everyday dining place (unless you have too much money to spare!) but certainly a good place if you want a romantic or memorable dining date! This restaurant has moved to the new place at Mandarin Gallery so try to get the seat by the window (for 2) if you like some privacy and bit of scenery. Because of the way the building is i believe, the restrooms are outside the restaurant, and so you have to walk a fair bit to go to the comfort room
2
The food was ok but overpriced. The service was too much, maybe because it was quiet they all wanted to be involved but the number of staff hanging around trying to be helpful was stifling.
2
My family of 2 young girls celebrated my birthday in this place because I love beef especially roast. The moment we entered, my mood was terribly spoilt by the female ushers who showed bias treatment toward locals. It's a real shock coming from such an international icon. I wish the GM gets to know of what's happening behind his back. The waitresses did a splendid job, polite & efficient. The food was marvelously cooked. The ambience of rustic chateau was cosy. O would have rated this place with "very good" if not for the rotten attitude of the frontline staff. Normally I truly enjoyed having Malay staff serving due to their pleasantness but this time, quite unfortunately it was ugly with those few. I could have suggested to my company of 200 for many corporate meal functions, count it a loss due to poor first impressions & disservice.

It is my pleasure to recommend you one of the best restaurants for steak which is Lawry’s The Prime Rib. I have heard about it for many times but have not got a time to try it.The PPS 25% discounts, tempted me to dine in. I was there with my friends. First, when we step in to the restaurant, warm welcome was greeted by the hostess. Next, when we was seated, the captain introduce herself to us, it was a very nice and simple gesture. She also gave us some recommendations for the starter and main course. Our final decision for starters was ATLANTIC LOBSTER TAIL and TRADITIONAL LUMP CRAB CAKE. It was fantastic; the taste for both is refreshing and light. You could actually taste the freshness and the main ingredient in it. And for the main course, we have decided on, THE ENGLISH CUT, Fish of the day which is PAN-SEARED COD FISH, USDA RIB EYE STEAK and lastly AUSTRALIAN RACK OF LAMB. I personally tasted every of the dish. The English cut, enliven the flavor of the beef. Its thin slice makes it easier to chew and you could feel the juice of the beef is revolving around the mouth. This restaurant is not only well known for their beef but also their seafood and fish. For the Pan-seared cod fish, it was cook perfectly. You could taste the smoothness and mild flavor of the cod fish. I love this dish a lot. For the USDA Rib Eye Steak, because of excellent marbling in the meat of this cut, it is loaded with flavor and remains tender during cooking. This steak is best to order it medium, so that the original flavor of the beef could melt in your mouth. The taste is awesome! I would specially come back for this steak. It's really worth trying. And lastly for the Australian rack of lamb, its aroma of the lamb is very nice. It goes very well with red wine. The after taste of having the red wine, could also cleanse away your palate and you could savor the lamb once again. We have also ordered the LAWRY’S IDAHO BAKED POTATO for our accompaniment. Its sweetness of the potato with sour cream and bacon give us a nice blending with the meat. My overall experience dining in there was a very good. As we have enjoyed the PPS 25% discounts off the main course. The price is very reasonable for such a tasty and exclusive meal. We will definitely be back for lunch again. Lawrys The Prime Rib capture the original and unique taste for each dish. I must say "Thumbs up"

I have been to Lawry’s many years back. My recent visit was during lunch service in August 2011. I went there with my guests from Japan and with some colleagues. The service provided was warm and tip topped service is provided. We had ordered the spinning bowl salad for our appetizer. The showmanship of the staff is very professional, its attractive skill made us crave for more. Their fresh salad is garnish with tomatoes, croutons with vintage dressing. The staff's observance to minor yet important details on our table is what we would applaud for. Next we ordered USDA NEW YORK STRIP STEAK and THE LAWRY’S CUT. The chef controlled the doneness of the beef really well. The beef is very tender and it does not take much effort to cut. The texture of the beef and the black pepper sauce blended with our palate very well. We have ordered kids set meal which comes with the soft toy for our little companion. . She loves the mushroom soup and the kids’ pasta which is garnish with beef and tomato sauce. She said that the beef could just melt in your mouth. As we have enjoyed the DBS 1 for 1 discount. This meal is definitely value for moneyWith the nice ambiance, it totally relaxes our mind. I would definitely come back for more

I am at a loss as to how anyone can even compare Lawry's to Mortons. The roast beef is little better than a carvery except hugely overpriced. The staff were friendly but not very knowledgable on their product. The spinning salad tasted nice but once again it is a fairly basic salad with 1000 Island dressing.However the the crepe suzettes and creme caramel were very good

The best dining experience EVER - bar none. Amazing food, superb service and I cannot recommend it highly enough. The staff are knowledgeable and friendly and seem to be able to cater to every wish. The food was outstanding, as was the wine. This will remain an anniversary to remember.

Went to this restaurant with my wife and we both thought the Prime Rib we ordered was delicious, however, the prices were extremely high. Overall, as good as it is, it is not worth the cost.The spinning salad was not was we had seen in our Lawry's, such as the one we visited in Tokyo. It just was not spun - how disappointing. Staff was very friendly and efficient and the atmosphere was interesting, dark and Old Chicago

We recently dined at Lawry's when they had their prices slashed. Sadly, the service is not as good as it used to be and so was the food.We could see that the staff tried very very hard to be polite but they all seemed so affected. Worse still, the manager did not stop to greet us or ask if we were satisfied with the meal. The only time he attended to me was to present me with the check and even for that, he did not ask if we were happy with the meal or offered a smile. But I could see that he was most of the time busy talking and joking with all the foreign guests. I left the place feeling that Singaporeans are not quite welcome at Lawry's.The food was not much better than the service. The servings were humongous which did nothing to enhance the meal or whet my apetite. I prefer small portions and presentation is always important to me. At Lawry's they sort of slap everything down onto the plate. Furthermore, my steak reached my table cold and well done, when I ordered medium. The only good part of the meal for me was the appetizer which was interesting and well presented.Overall, not a spectacular show

Was at Lawry's last week to celerate my girlfriend’s Birthday. Make special arrange to have her roses presented to her half way through our candlelight dinner. They even sing happy birthday song to her while bringing out our dessert. Other diners cheer along too, but this make my girlfriend very embarrass. The over all experience was good & the roast beef was why we are there in the first place, it didn’t disappoint us. Would recommend beef lovers to Lawry’s

See a little cockroach crawled across my table during a dinner at such a restaurant as Lawry's the Prime Ribs. Felt even more lousy when I was offered a 1-1 main course voucher when I settled the bill (Mind you, I still had to pay for the main course, just coffee and tea on the house). I do not think I will want to use the voucher nor to offer the voucher to someone else. What a lousy experience

Decent ribs but can't compare to Morton's, but of course lower priced than Morton's :)

Prime rib is great. The spinning salad is a joke.
1
Aweful uniforms. Bad service - not sincere at all, no smile. Food is so so. Terrible bread. Overpriced.
4
Honesty speaking, for the steak, it'll b 1 of the best in SG, but for the price ............
4
Order the prime rib and the sides are amazing... its a really nice place to enjoy prime rib...
4
One of the best steak place in Singapore. The other would be Mortons. No other steak place comes close.
3
pretty overpriced and food is good but not that excellent
4
love the steak here, yet to try morton's though, hehee
3
Very bad Taste:Price ratio.
No doubt the steaks are damn tender, but the taste is somewhat...lacking for the meats. The sides are ok. Prepare to fork out a lot for a meal.
4
in terms of steak, i still cant forget that japanese steak I had in HK but Lawry's by far is the one that is closest to it...i know i cant really compare them coz that one was Japanese wagyu beef but then Lawrys isnt too bad

Decent place for the carnivores, if unremarkable.

Service is good, but the food somehow doesn't go well with me

Spinning salad is gimmicky
4
Every bite is a burst of succulent, tender and juicy experience. Expensive though...

Juicy! Succulent!

Overpriced.

It is a great relief to have Lawry's in Singapore.. I do enjoy it everytime.. Great place to alternate the shopping with some good food..

The appetiser buffet was more memorable than the steak was.

Superb food. I ordered the champagne fish and chips. It was so-so. They are more known for their prime ribs. My husband ordered the Lawry's cut and he said the meat is tender and juicy. The lobster tail was fresh and succulent. We also ordered creamed corn which is sinfully fattening but love it still. Pricey though

We called the dessert chef to comment upon the "trifle" which was not a trifle, but a soggy mess. He listened, turned around and walked off without a word. The item was taken off the bill, but that was still one of the worst experiences I ever had at a fine dining restaurant. I will never go back

Over rated.

Average food. Lousy service. Nothing compared to the Los Angeles restaurant... *that* was good. Give this one a miss. If you bring your wife, they'll probably spill wine over her and scowl as they clean it up...

good steak family steak hse

Not bad, but I've had better...

Over-rated. Really. Only remember the spinning salad.

don't set high expectation! the medium rare steak is very bloody... not my cup of tea.
2
Nothing special... over priced...

The ambience is nice and the steaks and ribs are juicy!

Great ambience...love the spinning bowl salad most! Steak was...tender but not fab.

The roast beef here is superb, and I love how the service staff in their cute little uniform come by your table to do your salad - it's an entertaining show on its own with spinning bowls and whatnot. Go try this place before it shuts down completely (the premises have been downsized by more than half I think?)
