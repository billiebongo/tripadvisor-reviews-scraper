Great coffee not bitter at all... nice location
It has a bit of a smooth chocolate Nutty texture (I always have Long black)
5
Decent coffee, coffee roaster and single origin.
It is quality
I will return - excellent coffee
Nice area to sit

With so many options in Singapore this was the best we had. Its a little off the beaten track but worth the walk.
5
Great place to grab a cup of coffee while in Singapore. Staff was friendly and had great recommendations. I tried the cold brew, which I highly recommend!
5
I signed up for their latte art and was taught by the friendly barista. After just 2 hours, I am now able to make my own latte art. So happy and proud. I even got to bring home 2 litres of the coffee latte that I made

I came across this coffee shop in front of south beach tower and discovered an awesome restaurant that sells great food/coffee. It seems like a co joint since the manager said this is also Yellow Cup Coffee. COFFEE BREWED FROM A la marzocco Strada Ep and they roast their own bean is what makes it worth the journey for a great cup. Love their cup that has a slogan of "happiness in a cup".

I'm not sure how it is that I discovered this place, though it may have had to do something with the little cup symbol that you see on Google Maps, and the name. However, it certainly wasn't a place that I would have stumbled across because while it is near to Clarke Quay, it is a little out of the way, and it did take me a little time to actually find it. However, once I did it was worth it. Sure, it might not have the best coffee, and the service was a little slow (namely because there was only one person behind the counter and a heap of people ordering coffee), but it was still quite reasonable. Actually, they have two different types of beans that one can select from, something that I haven't seen in many other places

I'm a coffee lover. This place was on my list for awhile. I popped over yesterday. My flat white isn't the taste that expected at all. It was missed measured between espresso shot and microfoam milk (got normal milk). I really can't identify what I have got yesterday???? Another thing : The beautiful coffee artwork poster should take down. My coffee was super ugly. If it taste right with ugly looks that would be fine. But in this case my coffee was so oooo ugly and taste completely wrong..
2
We went there for coffee and eggs and toast and the answer is no.. the selection is too westernise and is not really fit into singapore .. anyway, the breakfast is not as tasty as other too, also the coffee is not as good as starbuck .. hopefully not becoming yellow submarin

We popped in for coffee on a Friday afternoon, it was not busy at all but the four drinks arrived to our table with a gap of five minutes between each. The acoustics in this place are terrible and we could his barely hear each other over the noise of the blender and coffee machine.
4
Nice little cafe, but most importantly the coffee is good. Friendly staff member who was courteous and brought our coffees out to us when ready.
5
Visited several times - always good food and coffee. Quiet and pleasant, not crowded which is also an advantage for me.
3
The cafe is delightful with a lovely atmosphere. We visited several times because it was next to our apartment but we found the coffee a bit "hit and miss". It needs to be more consistent.
5
This coffee is good, it's not bitter at all, tastes smooth and it has a nutty taste.
It definitely has a good caffeine kick. Enjoyable cup of coffee.
Love it 👌

Popped in for a latte. Sat outside. Not the best view, just a busy road. Latte was nice enough and the guy serving us was very nice. Quite basic inside but nice enough for a quick coffee.

The fruit waffle and coffee and sandwich is yummy. it only open during the day, just downstair from where I stay, the village residence. pretty cool place to hang out

What seemed (based on TA rating) like a good idea for a cup of lovely morning coffee with a bite of food, turned out to be a way-below-average breakfast experience. Judge for yourselves:- no "hello" or eye contact upon entering the place- no contact by staff within 5min of entering the place. Finally another staff member arrived and took orders. They also started taking an order from a person who just walked in, despite we were already there and directly at the counter.- half of the menu was not available: no waffles, smoothies or acai bowls that were advertised all over the place- coffees were overly diluted so I would rather call them "water with a taste of coffee"- ordered sunny side up fried eggs - received scrambled eggs- ordered ham&cheese sandwich - got a warmed up croissant with a slice of ham and cheese straight from a vacuum pack (supermarket quality). - the sandwiches should have come with a "salad mix" - they did not. After asking for them at the counter we got each 2 leaves of salad sprinkled with vinegar and 3 micro tomatoes on the side, still half frozen... The only nice thing about this place was the decor, however, this was definitely not sufficient to offset the miserable quality of service and food offered..

After reading a negative review of Yellow Cup Coffee alluding that positive reviews may have been put here by family or friends we decided to check it out for ourselves on our recent brief stop in Singapore. My wife had the Twin salmon nest and I had the Fruity Waffles washed down with coffees. The food was superb as was the service. Highly recommended
5
Great staff, vibe, food, and excellent coffee. Staff was short and group had ordered 12 coffee before me so the barista said breakfast mains might be slow, so I went with a croissant, but when it emptied I ordered again. The hearty smoked salmon salad was so fresh and she did eggs to order! Popular with locals, great spo

Went during lunch time and was surprised that there was no crowd and had a relaxing lunch. Menu was quite limited in variety but the food was great. Had Giant Breakfast Platter, Waffle with Fruits, Mocha and Hazelnut Latte. Easy to reach via bus 143, cafe is near the bus stop
2
There is a big discrepancy between the quality of the reviews and the quality of this coffee shop, (it's truly nothing special). I can't help feeling some of these reviewers might know the owner...
3
Everything you can expect from a coffee / breakfast shop. Good coffee, good choice of accompanying food, Good service, prices OK. Same building than Village Residence Clarke Quay.
4
We were staying nearby and wandered down for lunch. $10 lunch special was pasta and iced tea, tasty and inexpensive! Coffee was good, they also had a range of cafe snacks and other interesting coffees (Nutella coffee for a start!). Recommend!
5
Extremely affordable and value price for a double shot coffee. Super nice people. Seating available for short meetings. Good for a quiet breakout, lunch or waffle time!

TL:DR: Coffee was bad & Waffles were burnt on the outside and uncooked on the inside. Many fake accounts created by Yellow Cup Coffee to give themselves a 5/5 review.Visited this place while I was on vacation in Singapore with my wife. Read about how highly this cafe was rated on TripAdvisor and hence decided to have brunch there. We arrived at the cafe around lunchtime and we noticed that the entire cafe was empty which seemed odd to us as we were expecting a crowd for such a highly rated place. We tried their espresso, a latte and a waffle.COFFEE: As I was ordering, I asked their staff how was the taste of their coffee and they managed to use outstandingly colourful language to describe their coffee; they even mentioned that their espresso had a hint of wine. Upon drinking their espresso, it simply tasted bitter and lacked any of the wine taste that I was expecting. I confronted the staff and it was only then, that they revealed that the coffee beans they are currently using are of a lower quality. HOW MARVELOUS! I was only told that I've purchased inferior quality coffee AFTER making payment. I am utterly disappointed with the way this situation was handle. On top of that, the latte was poorly frothed and the milk was a bubbly mess. WAFFLES:Well, what can I say about the waffles. EVEN THE QUEEN WOULD APPROVE! The exterior was burnt and the insides of the waffle was still uncooked. Upon re-reading some of the past reviews, I've noticed that most reviewers who gave this place a 5/5 have only ever given 1 review. I got a hunch telling me that these accounts are fake and are created by Yellow Cup Coffee to give themselves a 5 star review and trick unsuspecting people into visiting their shop. It was no wonder that the cafe was empty during lunchtime; it is nothing more than a tourist trap.Overall, a very disappointing experience and it ruined my otherwise splendid vacation in Singapore

Just happen to finish a meeting and was wondering around Havelock Road in the blistering hot weather when I chanced upon this small cosy cafe. It was God-sent and I went right in. I was hit by a strong wave of fragrant coffee smell with a hint of mushrooms sizzling in the background. I grabbed a menu and went straight up to the counter to order. As it was my first time, I asked the staff that was taking my order on what he would recommend. Greeted with a smile, he slowly explained what the popular drinks were and asked what my preference was. I was quite impressed by his patience and after I ordered, he pointed out to me that I could help myself with some ice water that was at the corner and said that he could tell I was really hot from the weather. My waffles came shortly and it was really good. I would recommend this place for any one who's looking for a cafe to just chill and relax. Humble and cheerful, the staff there do make a difference. Food is good and cheap, and the coffee do pack a punch! Coffee lovers out there, take note

I've glanced over a review for Yellow Cup and made a note to visit it as we've stayed just around the corner and we didn't take the breakfast option at our hotel. Nice ambience and vibey as you walk in on the corner shop. Big tables to sit at and share a cup of coffee. Nice way to start your dayThe Latte's and Americano's are all excellent and high quality, coming from a coffee snob. Will certainly recommend the coffee shop for a vist and they do take-aways also. If we stay in the Clarke Quay area again, will certainly come for a cuppa

Our last day in Singapore and Yellow Cup was just near our accommodation. I loved the funky decor, lots and lots of good coffee on offer. It was occupied mostly by office staff, people meeting. We asked to see a menu and most things on the grubby and tacky menu were not available or crossed out, at first there was no menu to be found anywhere by the staff. Our table was dirty and was eventually wiped down. No cold drinks on offer or even water, may of needed to ask

Saw this restaurant get promoted on 'The Entertainer' application which said that YCC was having 1 for 1 offers on their mains. Decided to drive halfway across Singapore to find this place to give it a try.However, we were shocked to be told by one of the owner's that the offer didn't apply. Owner was barely remorseful and made it seem like he knew of the whole situation, and he was simply making use of the application to help to promote his uninspiring and run of the mill cafe.Cafe was really empty, absolutely no business at all. Food was quite lackluster in terms of taste and presentation. For the sandwiches it was pretty average and pasta was only alright as well. Coffee was decent.Disgusted by the actions of the owners as they have to resort to such underhand and unethical ways to attempt to liven their cafe; which has seemingly failed anyway considering the few patrons they still have.For those reading, do consider the credibility of the other reviews made below as I notice a large proportion of the reviewers having only '1 review' or having the same display picture and/or writing style

My son and I both love to hop from one coffee shop to another and we stumbled upon Yellow Cup! we love their design, service and their smooth cup of latte! my son tried their Ice honey latte and he is hooked! so yumm! must try
5
Nice coffee, smooth, taste great without adding any sugar.
Great location to chill (especially for those who work that area).
Keep up the good work & service!
5
The twin salmon nest was really delicious and the beverages were really good as well. Especially the green tea latte and the nuttelatte. Would definitely come back again! 👍
5
Nice place, and great relaxing atmosphere, for enjoying cup of coffee. Like the friendliness of the staff.
Would come again, to taste the different varieties on the menu during my next visit. 👍
5
Had the iced latte and ice drip coffee. Great value for money, these guys really know their coffee as well. A refreshing change from the usual coffee brands like Starbucks that rip you off per cup. Great job guys!
5
The waffle served with ben & jerry's ice cream was just a perect match. They know how to make the waffles crispy without being too oily. Added with the chilling ice cream, it was very delicious!The green tea latte and nutellate were superb. The flavour and aroma were strong, the taste was also great!Would definitely come back to try other varieties of coffees & waffles
5
Good coffee with a strong aroma. My favourites so far include the green tea latte and nutella latte!Friendly staff and the owner is always there to chat with you and make you most welcome! Would definitely come over again during lunch to try the pasta promo
5
One of the best coffee in Singapore. I love my coffee and can be very picky, but the ones they serve here is really good. They serve Nutellatte!! The taste is amazing, bit like drinking a mocha, But its Nutella. The place is comfortable enough where you can work or study and not get bothered. Free wifi also comes in Handy. The staff there are very friendly and always happy to chat.
5
We had one cuppa at nylon coffee and then went to yellow cup coffee (ycc). You could tell the difference in texture. Both were good but they were different :YCC sells a larger volume of coffee and has more bold and stronger flavour. My wife preferred the lighter textured cuppa fr nylon coffee. Both uses La Marzocco but yellow cup uses Strada whereas nylon uses FB80. Will come back next week!
5
I must say that if you know how to appreciate coffee, then the coffee offered at yellow cup coffee is a real bargain as compared to other premium outlet. the service was excellent. I was fortunate that the owner was there when i patron the outlet, and he served me with a sample ice drip tea, and he really know his stuff well
5
Decided to to try a new cafe for our coffee break. Ordered the Nutellatte; free WiFi was a lovely bonus. The combination of Nutella and Latte was perfect - lovely coffee taste with not too much hazelnut.Environment felt super chic and cosy, would definitely chill here more if I didn't have to go back to work
5
I tried their Single ice drip coffee while my girlfriend tried the iced matcha latte. The coffee is great and the ambience of the cafe is perfect for a date. They also had a good service which is a plus point for the experience.
5
I am not an avid fan for coffee without sugar. However, i was really impressed with their coffee that i took it without sugar. The coffee is really fragrant...
5
I'm not really a big fan of coffee so I bought their Latte and pasta. Both taste amazing. They also had a good service and nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend this place!
5
visited during a freakish hot day, has some coffee and pasta. The pasta - spiced with garlic - was really fragrant, and the coffee was also great. 5/5 would come back.
5
Great for hanging out & afternoon coffee. I love their Latte's & pasta. It tastes very good & I am always happy with my visit. I would definitely be a regular.
3
The coffee is just average despite many other reviews I've read, so is the food. However the service was decent so that makes up for the experience, partially.
5
wonderful coffee & very lovely people who always greet you with a smile will definitely come back when we return to Singapore make sure you don't miss out highly recommended
5
It is hard to find good coffee anywhere...this one was just below our apartment and a great little spot.
5
An eclectic, somewhat retro 60's place with a small, varied and interesting breakfast/lunch menu. Great food Great coffee - the best in a month of travelling! And, friendly staff and service. Will return!

We had coffee and lunch at Yellow Cup while staying at Holiday Inn Express Clarke Quay. The coffee was excellent. They sell whole beans of their special blend, and we just had to take home a couple of bags at S$15 each. The salmon teriyaki lunch and salad were good, but the rice was not Japanese rice. The staff are friendly and eager to please. The cafe has windows on two sides, so it is open and bright. The decorations are fun and interesting. There are tables inside and outside. The hours seem coordinated with office hours. They now have four locations throughout Singapore, so they are doing something right. We recommend Yellow Cup for the coffee
4
Really decent coffee made on quality machine. Small range of yummy pastries each morning. Very cute décor.
5
Top notch quality of coffee!!! Friendly and quick service!! Perfect for morning pickup and go!!!! Clean and neat shop!! Go Yellow!!!! I cant ask for more!!! Thank you Yellow Cup Coffee!!! You've just made my day!!!
4
Very good coffee at reasonable price in comparison to the bigger brand coffee houses. Lots of specials - check the boards.
5
Went here to hang out with my friends last week. They have the best nutella-ice-chocolate in town! Will come back just for the drink!
4
I like the black coffee with no sugar served with cake and muffin. The environment is clean and the price is ok with friendly staffs
5
So good I had a second. It's the best coffee I've had in a while and would definitely recommend.
I get a long black and the temperature was spot on. The taste was exceptional.
5
Brilliant coffee - could only be better if they served it in a large size as well as standard cup!! The waffles were great, as were the smoked salmon 'nests' my friends had. I will be back

Yellow Cup Coffee at 20 Havelock Road is really an oasis in the desert that is the Central Mall area. But it doesnt trade on this fact, it trades on really great coffee and pretty decent food options. The selections are simple, only one size for all drinks, the only choice being hot or cold. Simple but it works. The quality of the coffee is excellent. They open at 7.30 for coffee and 8.00 for breakfast,. I had their big breakfast one morning, very good value, certainly better than the hotel and at half the price. Another day I was tempted by a delicious almond croissant, oh it was good.The seating is Melbourne coffee shop chic, big tables and eclectic furniture, some smaller tables and some outside as well. Good wifi available and plenty of power outlets. A good place to get some good coffee, simple food and quiet time close to Clarke Quay or the Courts
4
Sit, relax and enjoy a great coffee and a chat with the friendly staff. Nice low key coffee shop with character. Loved the quirky wall art. Sat there whilst a number of local office workers popped in to grab a coffee and their happy interaction with staff..... must be ok if the locals like it!!
3
Visited for a drink when in Singapore - loved the yellow theme and decided to pop in for a drink en route to our destination. Ordered an iced coffee and an acai smoothie. The iced coffee was very good but the acai smoothie was anything but - just tasted of banana. Also though the shop wifi popped up on our phones and we asked the wait staff about the password, we were told it wasn't working - oh really?!?! Hmmm....Besides the questionable aspects mentioned, seems a nice place to chill out and hang out with friends
5
I love the laid back ambience, great coffee and brunch items, and cheerful service! Will be back again!
4
Good coffee in an area devoid of good coffee. None of the pretentious big player coffee blather that has become the norm in Singapore.
Good coffee, good service, plenty of Seating, good wifi, simple good menu.
Easy decision.
5
Nice place to come inside and get warm and enjoy a hot cuppa. Nice pastries too. The ambiance is great. I highly recommend their Yellow Cup Coffee blend coffee!
5
The coffee here is smooth, good, and strong to my liking, all at an affordable price of 5 bucks for a latte. Also one gets to choose between Nicaragua and El Salvador beans. My personal favourite is El Salvador.Their waffles are sinful but totally worth it. Crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside. Top it with a generous serving of maple syrup and it makes the perffff afternoon treat!Coupled with cosy yet quirky deco and friendly staff, this is a great place to chill away lazy Sundays over a quality coffee.

Will be back soon for their coffee again

Happen to Chance my way into this cosy looking coffee shop on my way to MOM. Quality of the coffee is definitely there, I’m not coffee expert per se but it probably has something to do with the monster of a coffee machine they have.I had the mocha, which was delicate but rich enough to my liking, their other parts of the menu look interesting as well. I’ll be eyeing their waffles next time =)Would recommend people to try the place out, especially if they are in the neighborhood

I don't normally write reviews on Tripadvisor but I feel like these guys deserve an honest review, so here goes. I wouldn't call myself a coffee fanatic but I always make it a point to try out all the Artisan coffee joints when I visit a new city. Some of my favorite are Intelligentsia in NYC (those creamy soy lattes!!), Nylon Coffee Roasters in SG (pore-tickling aromatic single origins espresso shots), and Mozart's Coffee in Austin, TX (ever-so-smooth matcha green tea frappé). Yellow cup earned a special place in my list alongside those Café for it's Salvadorian Beans. I ordered a single-shot espresso and these guys....they did not disappoint!! The taste was balanced, gentle, unburnt (they roast their own beans); with a very subtle hint of citrus. Would like to see more selections for Single Origins in the future but hey, quality before quantity right
5
These guys are switched on. They know what good coffee is. I found it was as good as any top quality coffee you will find in Australia. We went everyday while we were in Singapore. Beautigul coffee and good service run by young people. Also wifi was an added bonus
5
The hot matcha latte was really smooth and well-flavoured. One of the best I've tried.. My friends' iced versions of it was initially too bland but the owner took the initiative to replace them without us asking, and the drink was delicious! Really reflects the excellent service and quality of food they want to uphold. Will definitely be back to try the coffees.
5
Best coffee place for me. The staff is friendly and their drinks are top notch. Oh and did I mention about their La Marzocco's Strada machine? It is the new hotness in the espresso world, and I love to see the machine in action at YCC! :
