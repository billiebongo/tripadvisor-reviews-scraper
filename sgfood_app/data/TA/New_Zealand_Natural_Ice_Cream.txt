Many ice cream flavours, some sorbets too and desserts as well. Very good quality ice cream. Not that sweet and great taste

Always love to stop here. The ice cream is really flavoursome and their milkshakes are really excellent. It's cash only so be sure you have some but you will want to go back again and again

Brilliant! Just amazing flavoured ice cream. Went back so many times. The chocolate orange, coconut and salted caramel just heaven.

Their yogurt with fresh berries is very refreshing in the midst of a shopping expedition. Fantastic flavors to pick from. Portions available in three different sizes so you are not forced to eat too much or too little.

I have tried this ice cream brand in Professor Brawn Restaurant a couple times and loved it. Yesterday I was in the area near Paragon and decided to drop by to see their shop on basement. The flavor I picked was Lemon & Lime which just Excellent. The flavor, aroma and texture were just nice. The staffs were quite attentive here too.
