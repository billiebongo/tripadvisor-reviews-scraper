A Singapore institution! By far the best Shabu Shabu I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying! Certainly perfect for any occasion!

Nice Wagyu shabu shabu restaurant in Singapore. They serves good quality beef at an extremely high price.
Alternatively you can save your money and go to Japan and eat your heart out.

Four of us had a late night dinner at this place. They had a wonderful meal-deal that allowed unlimited food at a fixed price. We added some beer and Sake to the mix too.
We left happy and full.

It started all so well... We arrived Saturday @ 8.30pm 2 pax. Settled for A4 sirloin and A5 ribeye some Japanese corn and tomato for starter.By 9.15 the waiter was rushing us to put all in the hot pot and finish our meat... we told him twice we would rather take our time... but by 10 they have brought us out bill (Without us asking!!!) and I couldn't even go to the ladies!Amazing food, awful service that ruined the whole experience ... And I was already planning to take my husband there on the next date night! What a sham

This restaurant offers a set per one person. The price depends on the beef quality. I chose one tier up from the bottom (~$100). They served beef only first, the vegetable in the set was served after I finished the beef, they said to prevent interference of the beef taste.Overall, it's the finest shabu I've ever had. But this come with a price. If you are a beef eater, one set might not be enough.

This belongs to the les Amis group, along with les Amis, Aoki and bistro du vin next door. My first time here and I was surprised by the limited and expensive menu.

Shabu Shabu Gen serves you delicious Shabu Shabu in very traditional way of cooking. They have various beef option and also vegitables. Beef from Japan tastes very soft and it is a treat to enjoy the dishes. In Singapore, this is the only restaurant which provides decent Shabu Shabu for main dishes. If you want to try the hot pot for the first time, I think this place the best value and quality
