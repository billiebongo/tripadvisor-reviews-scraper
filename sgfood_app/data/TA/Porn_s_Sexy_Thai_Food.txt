Definitely recommend for a cool hipster place for gatherings with friends & family over affordable Thai food.
3
Authentic Thai cuisine that satisfies. Some of the food items are rather pricey though but overall the quality is good.
3
I like it as it is not crowded.. it seems like a restaurant waiting to close down.. there are no more excitment in this place.
2
Food was okay... nothing spectacular. We found it very overpriced for the whole experience. Felt that the plates could have been improved drastically- felt very cheap. Service was way below expectations :(
1
Only consolation was there were few tables so service was prompt. Clear omyam soup was bland. Mango salad was acceptable. Olive fried rice was not flavourful. Prawns not fresh.
5
quite close to thai spicy food, but not as intense as Long Chim at MBS. The minced meat or beef is not as intense, the clear soup was also not as intense. It might be it for westerners who do not like too spicy food.

I bought a 6 ppl share cny pen cai, n it is totally disappointed. It claims seafood r fresh but obviously not. It was frozen when i collected it, after heating an hr, it smells gd but taste really disappointed. It is my first time buying from porn's n it is my last time too

Decided to have an early dinner at Porn's. As usual, I was spoilt for choice, and decided to go for the set menu for 2. The portions were more than sufficient for 2, and the dishes were packed with flavour with just the right amount of spiciness. Overall a nice place to dine, with lots of natural light and spacious seating
3
The space was well lit & comfortable to sit in. No fried oil smell in the outlet. The price was a little on the mid-high side. However, the prawns could be fresher. YOU MUST TRY THE PRAWN CAKE & TOM YUM SOUP & MANGO SALAD. Wrong order: Deep Beef became Stir Fried Beef. This was rectified. Phew :) You will feel like you are in Thailand. The dÃ©cor and music helps. Give plain water leh. How cheap is that? It probably don't cost you much. We even bought 2 drinks already. Don't make us buy the mineral water. Economically, you invest by paying more for mineral water bottles to sell us, why not use the tap
3
First. They stated open at 11.30am I make reservation though chope at 11.45am but when I reach there it is not even open. called the restaurant a couple of time but no answer. Just when I was about to give up the chef came out to open and told us the manager and staff are not here yet.... and when present chops voucher none of them know how to use or never see before so waited again for the manager to come
3
I have an issue with the disconnect between the Thai culture and the restaurant's interior which is psychedelic and cartoon-y. The food is alright, not much better than what you can find in food court Thai food.
4
Food was great! Prices Affordable, Valu-e-for-money. IF you have no money and want to eat decent food come here and eat.
2
i went with my parents and the food was oily and very salty. fried basil egg, the basil was not distributed evenly and it ways salty at one corner which also mean the salt was not distributed carefully
3
Had my gym at star vista. The restaurant is not crowded so waiting time is short. Good to dine there after my workout. Save time
2
Though the food is nice, but the portion is small and the price is quite ex. It's time to review the menu to add-on more other dishes. Else most will not patronize the second time
4
The restaurant was spacious and the food was awesome. I would recommend all to visit however price is a little pricey.
4
Good is decent and reasonably priced. There is insufficient service crew though. Generally a decent experience nonetheless.
3
Food - simple and delicious...like the green chicken curry and tapicoa.
Atmosphere - simple and cozy
1
Atmosphere too simple, nothing much and sounds echo when talking, seems too empty.Food is not nice, especially prawns! Ordered tom yum hotpot but the hotpot is NOT HOT at all! Prawns are NOT FRESH at all!! Green curry prawn same, prawns ALL not fresh! Seems like wasting $$, I rather eat Thai Express or Bali Thai. Ice water also wana charge!! Staff should inform customer that water is chargeable when customer request.When step in the restaurant in Star Vista, I told the staff I have a reservation, the staff just knod head and that's it. She didn't even bother to ask name & reservation time or whatsoever. Then I did not continue further either since she don't bother. Service lousy too
3
Food was ok but place is short of staff. The Chinese staff was obviously overworked. Orders were taken by another staff who didn't even know the terms & conditions of the dinner set and tried to "smoke" us by saying we couldn't change the drinks when it was clearly stated we could at the bottom of the menu
5
Delicious and value for money. The food is affordable. The service is good and place is comfortable.
4
Menu selection have reduce but food quality still decent !!
Should consider doing more promo or buffet or its very quiet !!
Not much people eating always as price still abit on the high side.
3
A bit pricey and portions are slightly small. However the Thai food is pretty authentic. Worth a try.
3
If you are working and living around Bouna Vista area, you know Star Vista is the only big mall with many restaurants variety.
4
A good experience with nice and friendly staff. Environment is comfortable, food is delicious. Thumbs up!
1
We booked our table through Chope and was told no reservation is being made. Worst service I ever get from a restaurant in Singapore.
4
For a place with only two wait staff - the service was good enough. I especially appreciate the female staff who was gentle and helpful. The Steamed fish, Kang Kong tempura , sambal kang Kong, prawn cakes, pineapple fried rice, phaad Thai and chicken wings are tasty and enjoyed by all
5
i really like the food at Porn's. It is delicious with the right balance of sweet, sour and salty, the way I like Thai food to be. The portions are generous and my whole family was really satisfied.During the meal, my dad accidentally knocked over a glass and broke it. We felt so bad but the service staff was very nice about it, efficiently cleaning up the breakage
3
The staff looked confused when I said I have a reservation, he just ushered us to a random table since it was not crowded. Didn't took too long for them to serve the food, but the portion was awfully small. The taste were very average as well. I could easily list a few better and cheaper Thai restaurant. Though the staff were attentive.
4
The meal was good, the ambience was slightly odd since the restaurant was all pinkish with a thai pop song playing in the background. The curry chicken really stole our heart. The curry is enough for 2 people so good to get one extra rice add-on. Good value for money for $7 (approx
3
Waited more than 30 mins for food. Food was average except the Tom Yum soup. The fish cake was a bit mushy. Service staff was also unable to cope with the lunch crowd
3
Ate there by myself before my gym class at Amore. Consider it as a fast food restaurant with its simple and open set up.
3
reserve table is too cramped,will prefer round table or in the middle,food and service is good. attentive
5
The food is nice and sell at reasonable price. The staffs are friendly and willing to entertain us nicely.thanks.
5
We had the set lunch which was excellent in terms of taste and value. The tomyam seafood was full-flavoured as was the pandan chicken and the fish cake. Service was also great. Thumbs up all round. Will be back for sure.
4
best place to settle thai food cravings! we ordered their tiger prawns glass noodles and we loved it.
4
My second time here and this time it was for lunch. We did not order the set as we did the first time. The coconut seafood tomyum hit the right spot. The grilled pork was ample for two persons and quite well seasoned and tender. The pad thai was tasty and a generous portion for two. The papaya salad was piquantly refreshing with the right crunch of toppings. Happy
4
This was for 2 adults. We had the yusheng, kangkong tempura and the basil omelette. The kangkong tempura was an absolute winner. Super crispy, it came with a spicey coconut-based prawn dipping sauce which was really good! Loved this! The basil omelette was ok, but a little too minty with the egg, athough the egg was light and fluflly. I'll go with the prawn omelette next time. The yusheng was good too
4
We are a group of 3 pax. We have Yusheng, Dinner set for 2 and 2 other side dish. Avg $35 per pax. They were have a promo, every $50 spent, one free spin on lucky draw. We have $30 return voucher and book our next dinner next month
4
Food was definitely the real deal, comprising of the quality & the price that one is paying for.The tom yum hotpot is a must to order which was well crafted that I had enjoyed, as well as the outlet speciality of glass noodles with prawns that has tasted so absolutely fragrant!However the steamed seabass with lime could have been more flavoured up, with the meat slightly more soft & tender which would be an ultimate perfection! Indeed, a pleasant trip without going all out to Thailand which you could have it in Singapore :
4
I highly recommend their green mango salad, green curry chicken and tom yam soup (clear, seafood). Gave a 4 because the place is not very conducive for chit-chat.
3
went on a weekday noon and it was empty. food is average but not special..spent about 20 dollars plus per pax.
3
The staff service is not bad and the food is good. The food is served hot and the portion is just nice for four of us.
4
Friends loved the green curry. Tom yam was good too. Fried platter for 4 was delicious! But pricey! Staff is patient and helpful :)
3
Ordered 1 fried rice. 1 pad Thai, 1 bottled water and 1 golden tapioca. The fried rice and pad Thai are ok. But, the golden tapioca is average. The food are overpriced. Not valuable for money.
3
Customer service and ambience was not too bad. Food was reasonably priced as well, but a bit too sweet.
5
A bit pricy but this is singapore so not surprising. A very good choice if you had enough of chicken rice. BKT....quite refreshing and also tropical as well.
4
Enjoyed my dining experience at Porn's.The staff are really friendly and the food is nice!We ordered Tom Yum soup, garlic fried chicken and Tempura Kang Kong.The soup came with generous serving of sliced fish and the garlic fried chicken was really delicious!The batter of the tempura kang kong was a little soggy and not crispy enough. Other than this, the whole experience was great
4
We tried Pad Thai, Pineapple rice, Chicken green curry, prawn cake and mango glutinous rice. Total bill $61. Too much for 2 of us. Perfect for 3 diners. Prices not cheap but still reasonable. Interesting deco. Weekday set menu comes with a choice of drink. We opt for milk tea. Typical cafe pricing. Would visit again.

There's been a lot of hype surrounding this Thai eatery (the name itself has piqued many a Thai-food loving person's interest), so I decided to have lunch with a girlfriend there on a Friday afternoon. Unfortunately, the food hasn't lived up to the hype. I had the pad Thai, and my friend had the tom yam soup. My pad Thai was ok, but honestly I felt like the noodles were a bit gluggy. There also weren't many ingredients in the pad Thai, so I felt like I was just eating noodles with lots of crushed chili flakes. My friend thought her tom yam soup was alright, but nothing to write home about. I'm not sure if the other dishes are better, though. I'd probably go back to try something else, but only if I was in the area and felt like Thai food.
4
Authentic thai food that is reasonably priced and serves really good That food. Our usual orders and favourites would be pad thai, granny's prawn cake, green curry, mango sticky rice and Thai milk tea. Our to go place for Thai food!
3
I ate at the branch in kitchener complex. The green curry was fantastic however the tom yam could have been better. Also they did not use fresh chicken but frozen ones. Pricing is reasonable
4
Very good Thai fast food. Only about 10 items on the menu, but always busy and good quick service. Prices very low - $7 for curry and rice
2
Tried Tom Yam noodles.. taste was not good.. do not have tomyam taste.. maybe diluted due to shop is closing soon?? Only have sour taste..not like tomyam soup but the prawn and mushroom is fresh. Overall still disappointed.
3
My girlfriend and I went for dinner. The menu is good and the food was tasty. The service is ok. Not my favourite Thai restaurant in town but it's alright.
4
Ate at the SAFRA Mt Faber branch a couple of times recently. Both times the food was really good and service really quick and efficient. Gets quite busy at lunchtimes too.Food was almost always very good, especially the Tom Yam soup and the fried fish. No holding back on the heat levels thankfully and gives it an authentic kick. Portions sizes are good and prices very reasonable. Will go back for sure if in the mood for a Thai food fix in Singapore
5
Went there for weekday lunch with colleagues and surprisingly it was very good.Food is authentic Thai, portion size is quite good and prices reasonable. Green chicken curry and basil chicken were delicious. We had some appetizer which was ok. Lemongrass drink was just average by the way. Realhighlight was the Mango dessert which we ordered (Just Mango on Ice). Never had such tasty Thai mango before, we ordered a second plate..!!Overall a very good choice. Service was prompt
5
I went to this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and i was quite pleased with my experience Staff - 4* Ambiance - 4*Food - 4*Drinks - 3.5*Its a nice place. very affordable as well ... Thet sell local thai beers as well and quite cheap as wel
3
I wonder if this place is trading on its name and has stopped trying. It's a very popular place and the food was good but not exceptional except for the prawn cakes which were delicious. The service was slow and random, our food came out in dribs and drabs with one person not getting their rice until we had all finished. They had a 1 for 1 drinks offer on which was very welcome in the heat
3
As usual, will come here with my colleagues once in a while. We love their green curry fish and vegetable. Their Tom yam clear base soup also not bad.Why i say not so bad because I have tried nicer one and the price is definitely cheaper. However, porn is kind to give staff who works nearby a 10% discount upon showing your pass.Will definitely visit you again
4
We queued for about 20 mins before dining at the Star Vista outlet. Taste was excellent, serving was just enough for the four of us. Staff were friendly.
4
Food was tasty, we enjoy the 1 for 1 drink. Three Kingdom Fried Fish was fantastic, sweet, sour and spicy. kid can eat the non-spicy option also. Not very expensive. staff friendly and alert.
4
Met up with friends in Star Vista and came across this interesting restaurant name. The dishes names are suggestive, the food is good and staff is helpful.
5
Went here purely 'cos the name amused me; but the food was great (and good value), wish we had this chain in England.
2
Waited outside to be assigned a table and that took about 5 min when clearly one staff was standing at the door looking at me.
Food wise nothing special.. flavor is not as what i expect.
Maybe is overated..
2
Food is very expensive and am surprise anyone here who says it's reasonable. We order 2 simple dish, 1 small mango sticky rice and 3 drinks and cost almost S $60!!Picture below depicts 2 small spoon scoop of rice and some slices of mango. $6.90.Will not visit again
3
The most authentic thai food we have had so far in Singapore plus its close to our Hotel which made it all the better. Good Green curry with all the components, if you want it Thai style you have to ask otherwise its not that spicy.
3
Good thai restaurant but a bit expensive, dont forget to add the service and taxes (17%) to the prices in the menu. No need to tip. Green cury, seafood bowl are very tasty. Iced tea is good also (choice in beverages is very limited). Kitchen closing at 9.30pm
4
Hilarious name - looked great on my business credit card expense list. I had the pad thai and it was terrific. They were thoughtful enough to put the red chili pepper on the side - probably saw an American that couldn't hang with full-on Thai heat - and they were right... :-)Also had a lemongrass water drink which was nice. I went with four other coworkers, and they all enjoyed their meals as well
4
Not quite fine dining, not quite street food atmosphere. This is a pleasant little cafÃ© serving authentic thai food. I come here very often as it is near my gym. The fail proof dishes are - Tom Yum( both the clear and red are equally good and authentic), Tod Mun Pla ( Thai fishcake), Tod Mun Kung ( Prawn cakes) which comes from the owner's grandmother's recipe as mentioned in the menu. The basil chicken has more gravy then at some other thai restaurants. Overall good food and great value
4
Go ahead and do yourself a favor and go for the Tom Yam Soup!
Also, the stuffed chicken wings are pretty good with the soup.
5
Nice if you are looking for international travel and holidays in here. The list is endless and with good service it's never to be missed opportunity for anyone willing to come here. Do visit this lovely place to your convenience
5
You should definitely give this restaurant a try! The food was amazingly tasty. I'd say one of the best thai places I've been to. My favourite restaurant during our 3 day trip to Singapore.

Talking bout moving tables to accomodate bigger group of customer yes I saw the couple behind were asked to moved once to the side tables. The food so-so only. Thai Crispy Tofu $6.50 (7/10), HotPot Tomyam $12.90 (4/10), Green Curry Chicken $10.90 (5/10), Rice $2 for 2 (8/10), Thai Ice Tea $3.90 (7/10) and Young Coconut $4 (7/10).The most horrible thing when we tasted the tom yam clear soup is it was too sour and not spicy at all. We finished only 20% of the soup rest we have no choice but to leave it. It was the most disappointed tomyam soup ever. Rest assure, Thai Express has better clear tomyam soup. The green curry and tofu also not very good. The green curry was too watery. Other than that, the rice is good, I like their way of serving, drinks not bad too. Service is good and friendly. Think twice going there again as it's way too costly for a not-so-good food
3
The food was good, kang kong, fried tofu, pineapple shrimp fried rice. Prior to that, we were asked to move to accommodate a larger group of 8. After settling down, we were asked to move again, this time next to the door. Of course, the moving part was annoying and having the door open every so often was even more. I joked that we should at least be serve with a free dessert for the trouble, the server responded that we needed to spend at least $25 and she can do it. Well she just missed an opportunity to delight a customer
3
4 branches and many years later, finally had a chance to try this chain by a Thai-Chinese local celebrity. Admittedly it was only lunch and we had the set. I had basil chicken with rice. It was gooier than what I've had before but seemed authentic and spicy enough. My colleague's tom yum noodles were very spicy but she seemed ok with it. Overall, I think a bigger group to taste more dishes may gauge the level bette

About to head for a concert and wanting a quick meal, this outlet (1 of 4 island-wide) had less of a queue compared to the other food and beverage joints in this massive complex.It was strategically located such that it would be hard to miss it. What also struck me was the brand-name, certainly an immense draw for the dinner crowd. Luckily, the short queue quickly disappeared, leaving me standing first in line.My order was taken as I waited for a table and no time was wasted. The usual Thai dishes filled the menu. I ordered the stirred-fried chicken with garlic (chunky chicken slices topped with oyster sauce) and jasmine rice on the side and my partner had the olive rice, which came with generous servings of peeled prawns. Hot lemongrass tea completed the meal. Colourful murals dotted the walls and decor was minimal yet eye-catching.For a quick bite and fuss-free service, I recommend this food joint
4
Why I rated this restaurant a 4 star experience is the quality of the food that we got for the price we paid.Me and my husband spent $50 for our order of :1) Seafood Clear Soup TomYam. It was choked full of herbs like galangal and lemongrass, the resulting taste and aroma was one of the best I have had even compared to the authentic road side joints in Bangkok and high end Thai joints in Singapore.2) Green curry chicken. This was considerably milder in spicy heat, as a result the aroma of the Thai sweet basil was able to come through nicely. It was light creamy and watery, and very good to have with rice.3) Phad Thai. This was very good. Taste like what we could get from authentic road side joints in Bangkok.4) Iced coffee. Not as potently sweet as most other Thai joints'. Good to wash down the dishes without worrying about the unnecessary calories and diabetes.5) Fresh Thai coconut. It was faultless.All said, this is not a high end nice ambience place for the rare treats. But rather a dependable soulful take on Thai food that can be indulged in on a frequent basis
2
Went to celebrate a birthday. There are plenty of staff however busy just pacing up and down without doing any serving. They try their best to avoid eye-contact with the customers. Had to get ones attention and the restaurant was half empty. The gent who served us could not recommend what is good in the menu. Food came in one by one slowly. Not tasty at all. Not a good experience and would not go there. Also each table had a feedback form but no where to put it. The staff collected it not certain whether it went to the right people
2
Tried papaya salad and fish Tom yum hotpot. The hotpot portion is generous, 3 people sharing should be ok. A lot of fish. As a Tom yum soup addict, I'm rather disappointed with the soup that makes you thirsty for very long. No matter how generous the portion, nice ambience and reasonable price, I won't eat again. Other food items I don't think I will try. I think the thai food at the foodcourt though soup not as tasty but I don't think I was thirsty after eating it. The one at kovan used to be really nice, now standard also drop. I think it's only doing the right thing to my stomach by flying budget to Bangkok and eat the Tom yum in my life. Coffeeshop behind good hope hotel and service apartment must eat
