The service staff was excellent and quick, they also split our bill individually and remembered what we ordered when most restaurants wouldn’t. Food was really good too!!

We ordered a few different dishes to share and was satisfied with the mexican food here. There was nothing to shout about but it was a place to satisfy a craving for mexican food. Service was prompt.

I just had a great afternoon drinking Margaritas (yeah, of course). Great crowd, nice chilled outdoor area, cool music (curated by a professional DJ as you do). Love it.
