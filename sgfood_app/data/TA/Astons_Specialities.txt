Very affortable and Decent Western Food.
Like their chicken chop and variety of sides.
All-time favorite is their coleslaw and fries.

We came to this branch on a Friday night, taking a gamble that we could get seats quickly as Bugis+ has quite a number of eateries to choose from. When we arrived, there was a queue but it moved quickly as guests were shown to their seats once their orders were placed and payment made.We previously ordered pork chops, lamp chops, beef steaks, chicken, etc, but this time round, everyone in our group ordered beef steaks (medium and medium rare), accompanied by mac and cheese, onion rings, baked potatoes, French fries mashed potatoes.The beef steaks were grilled nicely. The sides tasted great too. Overall, the meal was value for money and we enjoyed the food. The restaurant was 85% full when we were there, one of the more crowded eateries at Bugis+.

I visited this place with my group of friends for a wonderful dinner. At that time of my visit there was a long queue and we have to wait to be seated. We came here because it is very value for money and the food are delicious. I ordered the hickory BBQ chicken that comes with two side dishes that you can choose from. I chose the potato salad and baked potato. The food were served fast and the staff were friendly. To sum up everything, it is really worth coming here to enjoy a delicious western meal

Had a gathering with 3 of my friends and we had a cozy corner seat which allows us to catch up with each other freely. The food were great especially the mushroom soup with garlic is so delicious.I had my Prime Rib-eye Xtra Cut as usual and the steak was juicy and nice with huge portion of sides which can be chosen from quite a wide range of hot and cold side menu. I chose the coleslaw and mac & cheese which was delicious!My friends had seafood mariana which was delicious with fresh huge prawns and muscles. Their chicken and fish combo was also delicious with only the not so good being the pepper sauce being way too spicy. Another plus point is that there is no service charge included in the bill but service was still considered good. However, no reservations is available so be prepared to queue for a table but we did get our table within like 10mins from queue to after we ordered our food so thumbs up Astons

i love to go astons as their steak are of superior quality but affordable price.the price is inclusive of gst so at a glancd one know how much to fork out for the meal.i ordered chargrilled chicken with cream of mushroom soup.the soup is tasty with 2 small slices of crispy garlic bread.the waiter was very polite and served with a smile.the chicken portion was just enough for personal consumption.most important it is not fatty..the potato salad should be cut into small pieces instead..overall a great lunch
