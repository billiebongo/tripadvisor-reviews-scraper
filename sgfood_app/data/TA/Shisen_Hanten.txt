It is not quite Sichuan cuisine and the variations in taste are a little confusing but the restaurant is stunning with it's high ceiling. Not cheap.

My family has visited this restaurant twice in just a month. We went back for the seafood porridge that we all said was the most memorable. This time, we ordered a few more dishes and they didn't disappoint us either. Would definitely come back again.

We dined at this restaurant as it advertises itself as a two Michelin star Chinese restaurant and it was located in the hotel that we were staying at in Singapore. The room is elegantly decorated in dark tones and features a lovely profusion of modern chandeliers. There are also plenty of staff suitably dressed as you would expect from a fine dining restaurant. We ordered a starter that provided samples of five different bite sized morsels as we figured this would be a good way of getting a feel for the cuisine on offer. The appetisers arrived quickly and were nicely presented but not up to a Michelin standard. One of the five appetisers was a prawn whee the meat had been separated from the shell and both positioned on the long serving board, side by side. The prawn hadn’t been marinaded in any way and there was no evidence of any technical or culinary skill present in any of the other items on the board. We ordered some wavy beef as our main course and the menu made no mention of nothing else been included in the dish being ordered not did the waitress serving us ask us did we want any side orders of vegetables, sauces or whatever.When our main course arrived, it consisted of four small pieces of beef that were to be shared between us and nothing else. The taste and texture was pleasant but unexceptional. In the interests of balance, let me say that we saw other tables around us being served with plenty of food and they were possibly locals who knew the score and what was necessary when ordering. Also, the prices, whilst not cheap, we’re certainly not what one would expect to pay for food that is supposed to be of 2-star Michelin quality. Other diners were very casually dressed and many were drinking beer so again, not the types of scenes that one would expect to see in a Michelin restaurant. Not only is this not a Michelin restaurant, it is not even a good Chinese restaurant so I cannot for the life of me understand why they insist on describing it as such both on the hotel website (it is located on the 35 floor of the second tower at the Mandarin Orchard hotel) and on big electronic monitors in the main foyer within.I don’t know how they are allowed to get away with this level of misrepresentation.

Was at this restaurant for my birthday celebration with family. Like the chilli prawn with bun, the roasted duck, tan tan noodle and also the almond bean curd desert.BRTon

This was our 2nd time to dine there. The chawanmushi with foie gras and crab roe soup is a must, it's extremely rich and decadent yet also light at the same time. Without doubt, the best soup I ever tried. The roast duck is amazing, crispy skin, medium layer of fat, tender meat, and not too gamy which some roast duck can be. We were in the mood for some lobsters, so they recommend the lobster with Singaporean chilli sauce. At first i was a bit worried because I was afraid that the sauce might overpower the crustacean, but it wasn't. You can still taste the natural sweetness of the lobster. The last dish were their signature mapo tofu. It's light, a bit spicy with tingling sensation on your tongue. This is might be blasphemy, but I prefer their mapo tofu than the one I tried in China, because the taste is not too strong and more refined. Will definitely come bac
5
Chef Kentaro lends a harmonised interpretation of classic szechuan dishes. Classic dishes are flavourful and nuanced without being overpowering in their spiciness. There's a sense of sublime execution in the hands of a master. The service was also impeccable as usual
4
We were unlucky to have made a reservation on the day of wedding reception, so most of the staff were, unfortunately for us, very busy with the guests.We still appreciated the food. Dim Sum was fair ,but not exceptional, but few of the dishes, such as crispy sea cucumber ,Szechuan -style marinated jellyfish and bird nest soup were exceptional and we didn't regret to have discovered this restaurant
5
But this is not my first time dining here, I enjoy dining here that I do not mind returning. There's a great selection of food that allows me to rotate between my visits.
3
Food was good and plated beautifully. Service was impeccable and the ambience in general delights. Definitely worth a return visi
2
For a Michelin star restaurant, it was very disappointing. The food was average at best. We had to return a fish dish as the soup was ridiculously salty. The classic dish of mapo toufu was salty and that was all we could taste, there was more salt than toufu. What a letdown. Service was also poor and lacking. At point we had to get the teapot ourselves to top up our tea cups
5
Loved the London Duck, the steamed Red Grouper, the Mapo Tofu, the Prawn Mayonnaise! Fresh food, very tasty! Wonderful, attentive service too
5
Enjoy delicious modern Szechuan cuisine in a lovely setting with high ceiling and lovely chandeliers. This Michelin star restaurant truly takes fine Chinese dining to the next level
5
Brought 2 colleagues who are visiting the restaurant for the first time. Wowed in every area. They particularly love the London Duck which in their words ‘melt in mouth’
3
Ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Signature Mapo Tofu, Nai Bai with Mushrooms. Quality is decent and not too expensive. Nothing to rave about. Service is slow and lacking. Still, I wonder why this place is worth 2 Michelin stars, or even any at all.
5
pickled Chinese fish is amazing. But I am not quite fancy with Chens' Mapo tofu. As a michelin restaurant, it is not expansive at all
3
This restaurant would never get two stars in Europe. Dimsum were very tasty and mostly beautifully decorated. But - service was very poor. When we arrived the first response was that we didn’t have a reservation (which we had). It was very tough getting the staff to notice us and had to wait rather long for our credit card to be returned. Not the worse things of course, but not ok in a two star restaurant.
5
Dimsum was very good. Ordered the usual fare and wasn’t disappointed. Also ordered some main dishes which were very tasty. My only comment is that the food was a bit slow to arrive.
3
This type of cuisine- Sichuan is difficult to make it refined! Therefore, this type of food is not for everyone to enjoy. Certain dishes will taste spicy and other numbing your pallete. Their signature dishes of prawn and scallop with chillies is actually very nice if one likes spicy with garlic, chillies and tomato paste. Their mapo tofu is spicy and numbing. Had their abalone chicken soup is very tasty but again not for everyone because some may feel it taste exotic and complex. Ambience and service is wonderful! Price is on the high end. In Japan this restaurant has a number of branches
3
The menu is very extensive. We ordered some dim sum items as well as simple dishes to go with Japanese rice. The har gao (prawn dumpling) was surprisingly tough, with an overcooked prawn filling. But we enjoyed the feng zao (chicken feet) which were tender and succulent; we also liked the truffle fried mixed vegetables dumplings. For the dishes, the la zi ji (spicy fried dized chicken) stood out. It was moreish and went well with the rice
5
The food is amazing especially those chief recommendations. The service is wonderful. I only thing I can suggest is the serving speed, for Chines food, to keep every dish warm is necessary. They didn't do very well in this
1
Food and service were terrible. I can't believe they got their Michelin Stars. I will never step into this restaurant ever again! I entertain clients daily and this restaurant will never get my business ever!!!
1
Not every dsy ee eat at a 2* Michelin restaurant. As high were the expections - so was the fissapointment.We were 5 people and our host chosed the dishes as he eats there regularly.The soups - fois gra, corn and hot and sour vegetable soup - horrible.The rest was not tasty nor nicely served - fish, meatballs...Deserts - nothing to write home about.Couln't figure how they got Michelin starts
5
Finally tried the place, its really good! One of the best Roasted duck and Roasted pork! The London Duck and the Fish Fillet hot pot is a must try
4
This is a very high class Chinese Restaurant but service needs to be upgraded if the are to retain Michelin Hats food food was good but not at the price charge
5
Very pleasant experience throughout the whole dinner. My family had a great night. However, the chope voucher that i bought ran into a little complication during payment. Do check with the restaurant before you buy the vouchers from chope.

A chance to have dinner at the Shisen Hanten in Singapore Mandarin Orchard was not to be missed. Touted as the highest rated Chinese restaurant, the food which was Sichuan with some Japanese influence was interesting. The decor and service were excellent. But our view of the food was however mixed. The teenager with us couldn't understand what the fuss was about. The adults were a bit more appreciate but were also not completely convinced of the 2 stars.We all did however agree that the "ma po do fu" dish was delicious. Just the right amount of tongue numbing taste
4
The attitude is interesting - I noticed it in several Chinese restaurants in Singapore actually - the tea level in your cup is followed very attentively and the refill arrives in literally seconds after each sip. All the other occasions - you'll have to signal quite actively that you require some help. Here you get one menu for two of you and it's not the one sheet kind of menus that you two can comfortably look into together, it's a heavy booklet with lots of chapters so it really is inconvenient to handle one for two.Now speaking of the other aspects. It's a very fine level cuisine served in an exquisite interior - even with a view, though the view itself is not quite interesting, as this part of Singapore doesn't offer plenty of sightseeing and the restaurant's windows are turned into other direction than downtown and Marina Bay.Finally the food - all the classics that you find in Chinese restaurants across the globe - the duck, the eggplants, starters and all the kinds of meat and poultry in spicy sauces. We were quite pleased with it
4
Good food as usual. Service could've been improved on as the way waitress who took our order was quite blur, we had to repeat our orders several times. [O1] “Chen’s Mapo Doufu” - $24陳麻婆豆腐 / 四川飯店伝統のマーボードーフ[C6] Foie gras chawanmushi with crab roe soup - $32蟹黄鹅肝汤 / フォアグラの茶碗蒸し　蟹の旨味スープI've never had foie gras this way! Amazingly creamy & very harmonious flavours.[E2] London roast duck - $42 half / $80 whole伦敦烧鸭 / 四川飯店特製ローストロンドンダックGreat for sharing, juicy & succulent.[H6] Stir-fried prawn with salted egg yolk - $36金沙虾球 / 大えびのサクサク塩卵炒め[L5] Deep-fried chicken with Chef’s special sauce - $26味淋香炸鸡块 / ユーリンチーWe ordered this not by popular demand but because there was someone present at the table that is a very fussy eater. Portion seems oddly small, so I didn't eat this. (I don't fancy fried food in the first place) [O3] Sweet eggplant in pickled chilli pepper sauce - $20魚香茄子 / マーボーナスGood level of heat - milder than the famous Mapo Doufu, but still packs a punch. Eggplants are not soggy (great texture). Sauce goes great with Hokkaido steamed rice - which you must also pair the Mapo Doufu with, too! MUST!!!! Steamed Soon Hock in Soya Sauce & Gingervery fresh, cooked to perfection. Simplicity is the best. & this goes without saying - be careful of the bones!
5
I had the seasonal chef recommendations. Food was awesome and service was excellent. Restaurant staff was able to assist with my flower arrangements for my wife
4
Arranged the place for a friend's birthday and the first experience was good. Friends all love the luxurious décor and the food was good. Service was good. They even gave us longevity buns as a complimentary when I ask for if they do make it.
1
Food (dim sum) was mediocre at best, and service was terrible, For such a big and empty place with a lot of servers, I dont know why it took forever to attract the wait staff-- even had to ask for utensils, napkin, tea refills, etc.
5
Hv not try this restaurant before. Is a good decision to dine in as the food is tasty & unique in dim sum design. Will not hesitate to go again
4
There were so many dishes we would love to try but alas it was only 2 of us. Picked the recommended dishes, like mapo tofu, French beans and vinegar pork. All were well excuted. Special mention to the mapo tofu. This dish is a must order. The sauce is rich but not overpoweringly spicy. The tofu is smooth. Goes very well with the Hokkaido rice.
5
Awesome food and excellent service! Authetic mapo tofu that totally fulfilled my cravings, love the desserts too! Will go back to try out the dim sum next time
5
Came here with my grandma for lunch. What I love about this place is that it's good for any occasion. If you want to celebrate a special occasion, you can get their set meals. If you want something more casual and affordable, you can just get their signature spicy noodles (担担麵) and you'd be full.I got the dry 担担麵 (which is the traditional version of the classic sze chuan dish) and it was amazing. The spice and peanut tastes are well balanced and the minced meat is also of the highest quality. We also got the prawn dumplings (水晶虾饺) and they were delicious too. The dumplings are packed full of fresh prawns which are steamed to perfection. I've read some reviews questioning the quality of their prawns before but from my recent experience (2 days from the date of this review), the problem seems to be well resolved.Will come again next time for the mapo doufu
4
Ok but not spectacular. Was expecting more from a 2 Michelin Star. Some of the dishes were average. Reasonably priced overall.
3
The ambient is great with posh decoration. Although located at level 35, sadly the view from the top is not as I have expected to be. Food: We ordered some Dim sum. You will notice the they use fresh ingredient, prawns and scallop are generous in size. Quantity is weird.. you only get 3 portion instead of 4.We also ordered a few dishes, mainly their signature dishes chili chickens, chili tofu etc.. I would say this... they use fresh ingredients.. the way they cook chinese food is considered normal to me.. didnt taste the wok fire taste as you can find in other Tze Char... sad to say there are better food with no M Stars... Services was Fantastic! Polite and helpful staffs!!!

Meal for two, including drinks, GST, service and 20% discount: SGD 138.40Eating Szechuan food, like having a fireplace inside the stomach and mouth, is quite exciting. Surprisingly, what I have found in Shisen Hanten is pleasantly different from what I have expected. I had always thought that good Szechuan food is very spicy and numbing, as I had before in China, but Shisen Hanten changed that perception. Turns out that Szechuan cuisine can be served and tasted 'beautiful' without ruining the palate of people who cannot stand spicy food.We ordered soup of the day, stewed fish fillet in pepper sauce, sauteed chili pepper chicken, Mapo doufu, original spicy noodle soup (Dandan noodles with soup), Hokkaido rice and Longjing tea. From these dishes, there are 3 of them that were standing out: the chicken, doufu (eaten with rice) and noodles. What they delivered were not something really really fancy, but they tasted great and had unique flavor that is difficult to be found somewhere else. I could tasted high quality ingredients used in the dishes, such as the aromatic and lemony Szechuan pepper and doubanjiang. All food smelt good and our tea was kept warm.Having a relaxed and beautiful ambience with good-attentive service from the waiters, I feel Shisen Hanten are setting out to feed their customers in a classy and tasteful way. The only downside was the price that is a bit high, most of the dishes have no single digit tag (even for the single-portion soup of the day), but we were happy with the 20% discount as the hotel guests. I am looking forward to visiting Shisen Hanten again and finding the profound joy of Chef Chen's cooking

Went here with a friend on a friday i night in march and had a really great experience.The food was really tasteful and was served in a very delicate way.We had maybe 5-6 different dishes, the sautéed wagyu beef with red pepper, barbecued pork with honey glaze, and the London roast duck was the best.Would definatley come back next time in Singapore
2
Service was lacking. Food was decent but not worth the price or the pain of dealing with such terrible service. Not sure how they got their Michelin stars..
4
Had a business dinner with top management and a Senior President on Aug 15th. Sharon recommended a great menu for 8 of us. Everyone was very pleased with the dishes, services and environment. A good one! Surely go back for business or family treats
4
Started off our meal with a bowl of [C3] Sichuan Hot & Sour Soup with Seafood 海鮮酸辣汤 / 海鮮入りスーラータン ($14++). This was a good balance of 小辣 (mildly spicy) & sour. The thick soup was kept warm by the tealight candle at the bottom, which is great.Of course I had to try the signature dish: [O1] Chen’s Mapo Tofu 陳麻婆豆腐 / 四川飯店伝統のマーボードーフ ($24++/portion). You definitely need to pair this with a bowl of fragrant steamed Hokkaido white rice to enjoy it, because it is too salty to eat on its own (trust me). I don't eat spicy food often - I was sweating by the end of this! But glad that I tried this as it is not something I eat often, so I'd want nothing but the best.I also enjoyed the [H6] Stir-fried Prawn with Salted Egg Yolk 金沙虾球 / 大えびのサクサク塩卵炒め ($36++) as well. Possibly the best I've ever had! Succulent & crunchy, with the ubiquitous SEY sauce that everyone either loves or is sick of. I LOVED this; the flavour wasn't too overpowering. Also, even though this was labelled with 1 chilli (symbolizes that it's 小辣 Mildly spicy), I didn't find it spicy at all.[R1] Cold Almond Pudding 杏仁豆腐 / アンニンドウフ ($8++)[R2] Mango Pudding 芒果布丁 / マンゴープリン ($8++)The desserts we had were simple, nothing too fancy, but well executed. Not a must to order, but definitely a nice way to end off the meal. Accepts credit cards️ Air conditioned seats only No WiFi available Accepts reservations (Chope), but I was able to walk in for lunch 2 Michelin Star

Was a business dinner with guests from HK. Service was impeccable. Guests were all praise for the London duck dish and also for the other dishes that followed.
5
Though a bit pricey, but for the quality of food; the warm service; and the ambience, I think it's really worth it. Their London Crispy Duck is a dish that cannot be missed. I felt sorry to have asked for dipping sauce for this dish, BECAUSE any additional flavor would absolutely be wasting the chef's effort in this dish!! The duck meat is super tender, richly marinated with herbs (I can't see any, but at first bite you can tell). The skin is translucent and crispy. Planning for my second visit with my love ones
5
Their foie gras chawanmushi is to die for. As its for our anniv, they even prepared a cake for us. Splendid night due to them. One of our to go tos for occasion
3
Had lunch here with my family and we ordered some dim sum with some ala carte dishes. The restaurant has a classy feel with its high ceiling and chandeliers and service is generally very good. But that's where the good points end. We expected a 2 Michelin star restaurant to offer something we won't forget but the food is, well, so forgettable. From the Kung pau chicken to the mapo tofu to the dan dan mian(so dry and cold the noodles become one big lump), they all lacked oomph, robustness and kick. The food tasted so bland and totally 'uninspiring'. I swear you could get better dim sum elsewhere too. The aloe vera jelly with yuzu is the only item we enjoyed. How on earth is this awarded a 2 Michelin star
2
quite astounded at how the restaurant managed to get starred as the food was really quite blah!not recommdeded.
2
We were looking forward to dining at this highly rated establishment. While several typical Sichuan dishes were quite savory, the signature dishes turned out to be surprisingly lackluster. Some of the dishes had so much salt we could hardly taste anything else. Service was mediocre on a busy holiday eve but that's not what one should expect when Michelin has generously awarded it two stars. Perhaps it deserves another visit
5
Great service. Brought my grandmother there. They accompanied her to use the service lift as she cannot walk well using the stairs. Good initiative. Food-wise, the taste is balanced; if the dish is meant to be sweet, salty or spicy, it will be just nicely sweet, salty or spicy. However for its signature mapo tofu, a little spicier would be better; it is just flavourful without the punch
5
... and that would include eateries in Hong Kong, which is saying something. The Dim Sum Brunch offer is a good bargain considering the variety and quality of food you're getting. All dishes were exceptionally well executed and nicely presented. The Siew Mai and the prawn roll in beancurd skin were absolute highlights and the Mapo Doufu a real joy
5
Just had great dim sim there today i have to say i enjoyed the food and the service was as good as you get in Singapor
2
A Michelin starred restaurant should have professional staff. Our first waitress did not know what the signature appetiser dish was. A 2-Michelin starred restaurant should have exceptionally good food. Ours was very average and better Szechuan food is easily available in Singapore. A Michelin starred restaurant should have attractive decor ... hmmm, no comment. I could go on (odd, for example, to have the rest rooms up a floor with stairs and no lift, especially when the staff toilet is not upstairs). We won't be going back
2
Incredibly this place has two Michelin stars. The room is dingy without any atmosphere, the service hopeless and the food poor.Our waitress had no idea about what was on the menu at all and had to find another one. The so called chilli prawns were dreadful and the signature appetiser plate pathetic in every way. Something is seriously wrong if this really dreary and disappointing place can be lauded by Michelin. It makes you wonder what on earth is going on 
1
When attending a 2 Michelin Star restaurant I would expect the staff to be attentive, the atmosphere to be inviting, and the food to be outstanding. The atmosphere was wonderful, but that is the best compliment I can give. My wife and I went here for our honeymoon dinner, safe to say we had high expectations. The food on the menu was a good selection, we ordered the Wagyu Beef appetizer, and two individual noodle dishes. The appetizer took 30 minutes to come out, and when it finally arrived it was cold. We figured maybe it was supposed to be this way as we were unfamiliar with the area and had a similar experience elsewhere. The flavor was there but because it is cold beef the excitement was lost. Then we waited another 10 minutes when they finally brought my lobster noodle dish, warmer than the app but still only lukewarm at best. However, they only brought out my dish and not my wife's. Because it was already lukewarm and getting cold we decided it be best if I just eat it before her dish came. Hers came 5 minutes later, my meal half done. Her meal was warmer than mine but still not fresh out of the kitchen hot. I cannot express how disappointed I was and still am on spending $100 on cold food. The staff apologized for how long it took to provide our food and gave us two desert puddings free of charge. My wife enjoyed them, I am already hard to please with sweets so it was lost on me. To be honest, the best part of the entire dinner was the green tea, delicious, not stewed too hot and high quality tea leaves. But, it is safe to say ai would never go back and could not recommend it. Save your money and go to Chinatown if you want some Chinese food
5
Great Szechuan food. The waitress recommend several signature dishes and all of them are excellent. Highly recommended if you're staying at Orchard area and love Chinese food. Better eat with groups so you can taste more than 1 or 2 dishes
5
Best dishes - mapo tofu, dan dan noodles w soup, sauteed chili pepper n chicken, stewed fish fillet in super spicy szechuan pepper sauceThe food is delicious and tasty and the flavours are heavy, which is the way I like my food.The table condiments (complimentary) of szechuan pickle and a super addictive condiment that's XO-sauce-like are both so delicious. Very glad they are also generous with their refills.The mapo tofu is on the oily side but very creamy and so good with some white rice.They offer both long grain and Japanese rice.The sauteed chili pepper n chicken presented itself as a dish of superbly fried boneless chicken pieces with a lot of dry chili peppers. The chicken was lovely - juicy, with a light coating but very crispy.The stewed fish fillet in super spicy szechuan pepper sauce was also excellent. It didn't turn out to be overly spicy. It was in a clear broth with alot of szechuan peppercorns (that you can pick out if you don't want too much of the mala zing). The broth is very tasty with alot of bean sprouts, making for a hearty delicious soup. I believe the fish they used was slices of black cod fish, which was very silky.We tried both the dry and soup dan dan noodles - the soup was the clear winner. The broth is thick and smooth and flavorful. The dry version felt a bit congealed and overly greasy after sitting out for a while.Service is earnest but spotty. I think unfortunately business is on the slow side and it's a large space for a restaurant with not enough staff.The space is gorgeous. It's a fantastic place to bring out-of-towners or to have family gatherings. They also have a children's menu.I really enjoyed the food and would totally come back again
4
A returns visit to this Szechuan restaurant reminded me of everything I loved about it before - mainly the food, as well as some new things that I don't. For starters, the restaurant seems a lot more popular than it used to be. Not a bad thing in itself, but it seems to have led to a deterioration in service. As another example, I found some waitstaff to be TRULY annoying - when I asked to be served some water (while I waited for my party to arrive), the waitstaff insisted I order expensive bottled water and would not even admit they serve non-bottled (i.e., tap) water. The food remains good though; definitely try the fried prawns with wasabi mayonnaise
4
The food tasted good and of quality. We had no complaints. Service was pleasant and attentive too. We would say it was value for money considering the location and ambience, one would expect to pay that kind of price for a dim sum buffet on the weekends
4
We had the Ala carte menu and loved the food. It would have been better if the shredded chicken comes in smaller portions. The mapo tofu is a must try and remember to eat it with rice! I had the best mango sago dessert here. The price is on the expensive side. However, service needs to improve as we had a long wait for our food to arrive.
3
The food was generally OK, but not that fascinating. The tea per person was charge at 6 per head. So 3 person was 18 .Was far too expensive for big crowd.
5
Very well decorated restaurant with friendly, sincere, and professional staffs. All dishes taste good, and authentic, not oily like other Chinese restaurant.
4
The setting is opulent with the lighting being a focus when you step in.The service was good but could be better: (1) my request for iced water was noted but had to be repeated (2) change of plates was nice but should be done without interrupting customers.The food exceeded my expectation: the chilli chicken had subtle mix of spices without overwhelming pepperiness; the sweet and sour pork in black vinegar was delicious, not the typical sweet and sour pork; and the kurobuta pork with asparagus and black truffle stimulated the nose and the taste buds.The Hokkaido ice cream with sea salt flavour was a nice way to round off the dinner.Its wine list was decent too.Prices were more than your usual Chinese but not high for a two Michelin
4
Very elegant dining room at the 35th floor of the Orchard Mandarin with a breathtaking views on the city. Eclectic, sophisticated and tasteful menu, with beautiful products of the best origins. Professionnal service. Very disappointing wine list with very few top-of-range bottle
4
Was here for a business lunch. First off, there are ample parking spaces for a Monday afternoon. Took the lift up to the restaurant situated at the 35th floor. The place is nicely furnished and guests knows they will be in for a treat from the first impression. The entrance / reception is actually situated at an elevated space so one walks down a small flight of steps to get to the restaurant dinning area. The tables are spaced generously apart and it adds a level of comfort to the dinning experience. The dishes are mostly delicious but comes in pretty small portions. We tried many dishes and the only dish I will not order next time was the fish, one of the recommended dishes. The taste was actually fine but the fish had a lot of bones and this could be a problem to some. I also noticed the spiciness is milder than other similar restaurants and this allowed the dishes to be enjoyed better. The chilli does not overpowers the underlying taste of each dish. In general, great restaurant for a high end chinese meal experience
3
Nice place but service is rather slow. Portions are rather small. Ambience is nice and most of the staff are attentive though food comes at a rather slow pace. Prices rather steep
4
food was decent though slightly on the expensive side. dim sum could do with more variety though. Service was acceptable but expected from a restaurant of this quality
5
On our second night in Singapore, staying at the Mandarin Orchard, 26 floor suite, we were recommended to try this 2 star Michelin restaurant , a fusion of Japanese with Sichuan restaurant by Iron chef on the 35th.What an amazing find, we had a private room filled with Chinese antiques and vases and gorgeous crystal chandeliers.Starters was sublime with salmon skin with sealed egg yolk and salt and smoked chicken.The most outstanding dish of the night was the chawan mushy with crab and foie gras. It was a multitude of different flavours all rolled into one. Great service and explanation by the ever attentive staff who told us that we can eat the soup in three ways. Next came the garoupa with special Japanese chillies reminding of the Thai sea bass with chillies in a soup. The taste was in both the fish and the sauce and the chilly was not overpowering but just right.The three kinds of mushroom with truffle so reminded me of Thomas Keller's French Laundry. Done stirred fry, it went so well with the Riesling from Alsace region. Our mains of duck and mah po tofu was another good meat recommendation. It was classily presented and tasted superb.We finished with a dessert of Amochi with palm sugar, a good Japanese and local mix.As we were finishing our dessert, we were greeted by the CEO of meritius to asked how our food was. How great it is to have such a personal touch. We were introduced and found out his name is Mr Tan Kim Seng.We told him that we usually stay at the Mandarin Orchard because We rate the Hainanese chicken rice as the the best in the region. It is not easy for a Malaysian to say so but I must confessed that. Now we have two places to look forward to dine in Singapore.When a meal is so fulfilling and satisfying, you feel like you on top of the worldWell done Mr Tan Kim Seng and your team

stayed at the hotel. after checkout, we decide to grab lunch before heading to airport.initially we thought it was a japanese restaurant. nope. it's a Chinese restaurant by Japanese chef.we walk-in and was told that it's full! but the front lady was very very helpful. she got us a table after since we are hotel guess. even if you are hotel guess, please make reservation days ahead especially weekends ambience is cosy and classic.Food----Unfortunate we do not have much time and rather full from breakfast, we do not order much and don't have the time to try the finer food.Food is very good. (Will definite return for proper dinner) Some of the food is quite spicy too, so be prepared to ask to tone it down when ordering. service is as expected of Michelin Stared overall, we are glad we were able to try it and will definitely come back for proper Dinner
5
Very nice ambience and decor! Service is of very high standard. The must tries are the dimsums, the London duck, the crispy spicy chicken, chawanmushi with foie gras and crab roe! And prices are very reasonable when you compare with similar quality Chinese restaurants (Michelin starred) in Hong Kong!
5
I loved this place. The food and the service were amazing. We had to make a reservation, but the place was not full. If you want dim sum, you have to go at lunc
1
Be aware! If you plan to come for an A la Carte lunch it may take an hour for your food to arrive. Apparently a handover from Dim Sum kitchen to another!! Service was poor. Nobody informed us of the long wait. The dishes that came were poorly presented. As if it had been hurriedly thrown on the plates. After all the fuss they even forgot to bring a dish. Non of the dishes were memorable. Could name a lot of chinese restaurants that could do a better job with the food and are not Michelin starred.V disappointed
4
I patronized the restaurant way before it got it's Michelin stars. I must say the quality has remained consistently good. And prices still affordable. I often bring my clients there for lunch not only because the food is good, and prices won't exceed my budget but the ambience is perfect for entertaining client

I came here for my pre-wedding meet-the-family dinner and boy, I am so glad I picked the right place.The restaurant itself has an amazing ambience - classy and elegant, with really high ceilings decked with chandeliers. I kept my fingers crossed that it isn't one of those high-end places with haughty staff. Thankfully, the service was impeccable and very personable.The food was nothing less than satisfying. While it did not blow my mind (or tastebuds for that matter), I felt that it was worthy of its Michelin stars. And with overall experience in consideration, it far exceeds many overrated restaurants out there.This, is going to be my new "special occasions family dinner" place from now on.Ordered:Turbot fish, wok-fried with shishito peppers (my favourite)Sautéed beef with red peppers (my favourite)Hui Guo RouMapo DoufuVegetables with duo mushroom and truffle oil (my favourite)
3
I came here first time with the understanding of the restaurant was given a 2 star Michelin . However, I am a little disappointed of the food, service and the ambience. The waitress was friendly and attentive but the way it was served somehow no different than any typical chinese restaurant . We ordered some of the signature food like the London duck , spicy chicken and fish cook in special spicy space. Taste is not bad but I expected the better one . Ambience is good and Golf choice of wines. One thing if this is not rated as Michelin star restaurant and I would except the food as one of the best amongst the si Sichuan restaurant here in singapore
4
Brought my guests for dinner. We placed ordered but 1 of the dishes was left out, the rice were served after we were half way eating and after we reminded them the rice is yet to serve. Nonetheless, the dishes are yummy. If you are not particular about services, definitely worth eating again,
4
We were there for a weekend brunch and we enjoyed every minute of it. The service was outstanding and food is really good
4
It was my first night in Singapore and the hotel recommended this place. I tasted the following:- Soup with Foir Gras - This was interesting but not outstanding- Kobe Steak Slices - Definitely taste and juicy. 5/5- Asian Noodles - Combination of sweat, sour and hot. Was good.- Cocos Dessert with bird nest - New experience of my tongue.So the restaurant bring so special to my experience why is expecting from a Michelin star restaurant
4
So my friend insisted on coming here, supposedly it's Michelin starred? I thought it was good, certainly, but kinda overrated. I should have stuck with what I knew would have been good, instead the set menu I got consisted of some pretty exotic stuff, like sea cucumber, which I could have done without
5
the food has a good balance of Chinese and Japanese fusion. Ingredients used were premium and very fresh!
4
My 2nd visit to Shisen Hanten. Good food and great service. I will advise to make your reservation earlier if you are going for a weekend dinner. I made a dinner reservation 2 days earlier but I can only get a table with 90 mins meal time. As someone who wish to enjoy great food with no time restriction, this quite dampen my dining experience.Service is good, you will be attended asap if you require the staff's service. Your tea will never get cold as they will refill your tea cup when they see it half filled.I ordered the same soup which I had previously, Foie gras chawanmushi with crab roe soup. The flavour of the soup is so rich that it can be considered as a meal itself.For the meat dish, I had the Classic Peking duck with condiments, and 2nd course wrapped in lettuce. The Peking duck is good, however not out of the world. You can get the same standard from other Chinese restaurant. The 2nd course wrapped in lettuce is slightly more than what I expected. The meat are juicy and goes very well with the lettuce.We had the Stewed Chinese cabbage with dried scallops for the vegetable dish. This is a very simple dish which might exceed many's expectation. The Chinese cabbage is sweet and full of the dried scallop's flavour. The ingredients are definitely high quality and fresh.Their signature dish, the Chen’s Mapo Doufu, this time I asked them to serve this as the first dish. During my previous visit, this was served last when I was already full and no more rice in the rice bowl. In the end I was eating spicy beancurd as dessert. This time I enjoyed this dish more than my previous visit.I am happy with my 2nd visit to this restaurant. I will recommend this restaurant to both visitors and locals. The dishes are crafted in a way that suits the international palate. You do not have to worry about the dishes being too spicy. Once again, book early. 90 mins is not enough for a decent meal
4
Shisen Hanten consistently delivers well cooked Cantonese and Szechuan dishes that are balanced, nuanced and made with good ingredients. Of particular note are a well balanced mapo tofu dish, some good wok fried dishes and solidly executed steamed fish. On top of that, they have one of the nicest locations and dining rooms for a top Chinese restaurant in Singapore and I have found the service at Shisen to be the best and most consistent among Chinese restaurants in Singapore.Waiters and managers are all polite, efficient and helpful. However, if you dine here expecting the food to be similar to an average 2 michelin star restaurant, you will be badly dissapointed. The cooking while good is noticeably below most 2 starred establishments in terms of depth of flavor and sauces. At best, a strong 1 star
5
Beautiful restaurant, went with my family of 12 pax and they managed to fit us into 1 table.Staff appeared short handled as we needed to remind them to refill our tea. Food portion appears slightly small - perhaps it appeared small as there were 12 of us. Delectable food and the staff were very helpful in recommending what kind of fish would go with what kind of cooking method. We enjoyed our dining experience
4
The location is beautiful, great view of the city try ask for a table by the window. Food was really special, we ordered a number of sharing plates so we could try more items.
3
I've eaten in several Michelin star restaurants in Europe so I compare this experience to them. We started with the appetizer of the day which was three small bowls of jellyfish, chicken and BBQ pork. We were quite underwhelmed with frankly all of the dishes. They were a bit unsalted and lacked flavour besides the jellyfish which had a bit more to it but still not impressed.For mains we had scallops with XO sauce and some chefs specialty fish/mussels soup. The scallops were cooked ok or just a bit over and had some taste, the best dish of the night.The soup was tasteless and lacked in salt as well. The fish was what you can expect when you put white fish in clear tasteless soup and the mussels tasted like mussels which was the best part of the dish.The wine list included only two white wine options when ordering by the glass. Although the waiter did her best trying to push some 90 SGD bottle we sticked with the two wines which were not great.The service was friendly but mediocre when compared to some other Michelin starred places. Also the waiters seemed to be in a hurry to get rid of us as they were speeding the process for example by offering dessert menu to my wife while I was still eating my main course. Not following the etiquette there. Also the descriptions of the dishes were minimal when brought to us.If his would be normal restaurant without Michelin expectation and half the price I would say all this is fine, but now we were left underwhelmed with the experience
4
Celebrated my mum and wife birthday there. Had a very good experience there considering it was our 1st time to a 2 Michelin Stars restaurant. We were having a la carte lunch. The steam fish was cooked just right, have not eaten such a nice and timely cooked fish for a long while. The services were great. Will be back soonest for the dim sum buffet
3
Their signature menu, mapa tofu was so salty and spicy that my taste buds in tounge became paralized and i should keep on drinking ice water over and over again. In addition, view was also so so.
3
what a disaster..booked for 6 of us last evening for my wifes birthday.service was good but the food was so ordinary that it does not even deserve a michelin mention let alone 2 stars..i respect michelin rating generally but this one is a bad choice
4
Yummy food though i was disappointed their cold noodles was nothing close to cold.Thanks for a great time at the restaurant for birthday celebration
4
I had lunch with my friends and the place is nice. We had dim sum and they taste good.They do have window seats and look cosy
3
Managed to book a table 2 days in advance for Sunday lunch. Had dimsum and noodles. The food is well prepared and tasty, but remembering this is a 2 Michelin starred restaurant, i must say it cannot match any of the food that I've tried at other 2 or even 1 Michelin starred restaurants. Just in SG, some of the 1 stars would be better in food quality and reflecting the unique character of the chef much more spectacularly (e.g. Odette). For e.g. the rice paper rolls (cheong fun) with char siew was nothing special - not the softest, delicate of textures, not enough char siew, not enough sauce. The siu loong pau was not bad, but again, Din Tai Fang version (for e.g.) would be more delish. Noodles were very good though - I like the dry dan-dan noodles.I guess that ignoring the stars, this would be a good restaurant with fairly good food. I really wonder what those Michelin inspectors were smoking... Waku Ghin only 1 star is another good example of miscarriage of assessment.By the way, service (which Michelin say doesn't factor in the stars) was average. My water was not topped up until asked. Dirty plates were not exchanged (which restaurants like Imperial would fastidiously do).I would go back here, but I will need to fight hard to ignore the stars and treat is like a normal restaurant
5
Peking dock is my family's favorite! My 2 and 4 year-old love ducks. We had tried three "recommended" and only one we would go back again! Luckily, we find another one today! The staff is very attentive and friendly! We appreciate their understanding of dining with kids could be challenging
4
Elegant décor with more than ten chandeliers hanging from the grand double-height ceiling. Excellent service - one of the best in town. Some unusual dishes - eg. chicken with a very yummy sesame sauce, delicious albeit sinful foie gras chawanmushi with crab roe soup, etc. Even the yusheng for Lunar New Year (aka 春節 or Seollal or Tết) has nice (moneyed) additions like ikura crispy fish skin. The Sichuan dishes are very good, but to be honest, not so much better and less satisfying than at the Sichuan DouHua branch on top of OUB Centre - the mapo dofu is too salty. A must among Chinese in Singapore
5
I was there with low expectations although was told that this is a Michelin 2-Star rated restaurant. We ordered roasted duck, ma poh tou fu, honey grilled pork, soup that looks like shark fin and a vegetable with mushrooms and abalone. This first item which came out was the soup, and oh my goodness, such good taste! Then followed the rest of the delicacies and then there was no end to my saliva gushing out from my taste buds. Roasted duck was my favorite due to the crunchy of its skin and deliciously marinated flesh. This is making my review really difficult because I kept thinking of the food and can't focus on the writing. Its a bit pricey but what the heck, we only live once, so please go pampered yourselves with good food whenever you get the chance
4
Just a walking distance from our hotel to this restaurant. We ordered a few simple dishes which turned out to be good and tasty. I know they serve sichuan cuisine but we avoid those spicy dishes
4
Went there over the weekend for tim sum lunch. The ambience is lovely and both the food and service were good. However, it may not be deserving of a two Michelin stars as I have tried better tim sum and Chinese food. None of the dishes strike me as particularly memorable, although it was a good dining experience
3
the food was food for the paid price... but quite average for a michelin 2 starred restaurant... a little bit disappointed for the signature dish mapotoufu...and the 2 main courses were served together which surprised me as it should be served one by one...
3
After trying several excellent restaurants, I was told that this was a top restaurant. Maybe I came when the restaurant was practically deserted but in spite of the lavish decor, I found it not very welcoming. The service was poor and the Dim Sum did not measure up to others in the city. Its was also more expensive
1
This restaurant is rewarded by two Michelin stars. There is nothing that matches to any level of recognition by Michelin. Unprofessional staff and glumsy service. On top of that food that you can buy on the street. Not a single piece of the dinner experience that could be regarded as fine dinging. I hope that Michelin quickly reasses this retaurant or I lose my trust to them
4
We were there for our christmas dinner on the assumption that the western places wpuld most likely be full and offering fixed menus, so we opted for this michelin starred restaurant. Truth be told thought wasnt expecting much from it, but was proven otherwise, decently priced and service was welcoming and very courteous. I would recommend the prawn in an orange sauce (ask your server i forgot what was it called), but it was to die forrr
4
This 2 Michelin star restaurant has 2 seatings for lunch, 11am and 1pm, and on Christmas Eve, we went for the earlier seating. Service wise, friendly but not intrusive, though there were certain lapses, as evident by several of the service staff who were new and were still being taught service etiquette while on the job. The more senior staff had performed much better.Upon entering the restaurant, one cannot help but notice the overhead chandeliers that helped light up the otherwise dim dining room. Tableware was elegant, though the tea-pot ($6 per pax for pu'er tea) did not have a spillage free spout. There was a nice touch of including candle underneath to warm the tea-pot throughout service. Apart from that, the view overlooking city skyline was good as well.The highlight of the lunch is definitely the food. We ordered the $68 per pax menu that was available during Christmas season. The cold steamed chicken and jellyfish was tender with lots of flavour from the sesame sauce, and the signature Chef Mapo tofu came with the right amount of Chilli and the numbing sensation was just perfect. The stir-fried prawn, though, was not freshest I have eaten, and thus lack the juiciness and was not tender. The food was served slowly from appetisers to mains, then towards the end, the service staff rushed the last main course and dessert. While we were still on dessert the service staff reminded us about the timing twice and advised we finish our food. Granted it was 12:45pm and the next seating was at 1pm, but I believe that a 2 Michelin star restaurant should be able to manage a smooth transition of seating better, as there are sufficient staff members present and the restaurant is less than half full for first seating making it easier to prepare tables for second seating. It was a good experience dining at this restaurant, with stellar food but unfortunately, less professional service. Will come back in the future and recommend to others, if only for the food experience
4
Very nice ambience. Service is excellent. Food is served quickly. And the food taste is amazing. Really meet the expectation of a two star Michellin. The price is very reasonable. Make sure you try the foie gras cawan mushi with crab roe, chilli prawn and sauteed szecuan chicken. The reason I did not give a 5 star because I have not tried many other dishes. May be next time after trying other dishes
5
Our group of 4 couples had a post Christmas lunch. Following the instructions when we booked, it was easy to find using the Mandarin Gallery lift. There are some steps down to the restaurant. The place is very spacious. The food tastes delicious. We loved the London roast duck which is tender and yummy. The spicy chicken has a punch to its spiciness. The wagyu beef is nicely fried. The soup was good as well. Generally we liked the food although they were not spectacular. The portions (8 dishes) are reasonable and just enough for our group. The service is pleasant and the view on the 35th floor is great too. Ask for the window seat if you have a big group.

Founded in 1958 in Yokohama, in the Kanto region of Japan, by Chef Chen Kenmin, Shisen Hanten, also known as Akasaka Szechwan Restaurant, is a Chinese Zi Char fine dining restaurant that specialises in Chinese Sichuan / Szechuan cuisine. Chef Chen Kenmin, the 'Father of Sichuan Cuisine', passed his legacy on to his son, Iron Chef Chen Kenichi, who expanded the business overseas. In turn, Iron Chef Chen Kenichi, 'The Sichuan Sage', passed the business to his son, Chef Chen Kentaro, who opened the 1st Shisen Hanten outlet in Singapore in March 2014.Ambience at Shisen Hanten impresses with its sleek, modernist, sophisticated feel. Glossy black walls against clear windows look sleek and chic, while offering fantastic views of the city from the space on the 35th floor of Mandarin Orchard Singapore hotel. The high ceiling lends a sense of space, while multiple chandeliers light the area with a white glow. Sturdy and comfortable furniture are neatly arranged in the open, communal dining space, while decor of flowers and ornate Imperial vases lend an Oriental touch. Fantastic.Service at Shisen Hanten is befitting its 2 Michelin star, fine dining status. As the most highly Michelin guide rated Chinese restaurant in Singapore, expectations are high. I'm glad to say that staff are professional, courteous, and efficient. Able to converse in both English and Chinese Mandarin, guests are quickly greeted and ushered to their seats. Staff display excellent product knowledge on each dish on the menu, and are able to offer astute recommendations. As expected they serve in traditional fine dining style, and clear plates after each round of courses. Good!Food at Shisen Hanten is Chinese Sichuan / Szechuan cuisine, though this is also complemented by other Zi Char style dishes. Generally, dishes are kept simple, but use fresh ingredients, such that the taste of the star ingredient naturally shines through on its own. Most dishes are tasty, and above average in quality, though as comparision, you could get equally good quality like this elsewhere. Portions are either sized for individuals or for communal dining, check with the staff when ordering. Prices are moderately expensive, though not exorbitant. Still rather reasonable, budget about SGD $58 per person for a meal here.Despite this being Iron Chef cooking, they don't serve authentic flavours here, as the level of spicy heat and oily textures has been vastly toned down in most dishes to appeal to the masses. Instead, you get more natural, clean-tasting dishes. While the ambience and service is impressive, the food is just alright, and personally, I won't be visiting again unless necessary
4
Had went for the weekend brunch which had surprisingly good value with unlimited dim sum, single soup, main course, and dessert dish per diner. Dim sum was good but unremarkable, but the Sichuan dishes were really good. Must order the Mapo tofu, fried chicken with dried chilies and dandan noodles.
4
The restaurant looks amazing. The food is of excellent quality (although I personally don't think the spicy is at the authentic level for the KungPao Chicken or MaPo Tofu). The service staff is probably one of the best in terms of attentiveness and also friendliness.I have been there 3 times now for the dim sum brunch. All's good.Except the dim sum brunch is timed - 1h 15 mins.I feel the whole idea of a nice weekend brunch is to relax and share stories and maintain ties with friends and loved ones, talking and laughing, but instead you feel that you should "stuff your face first" then start talking.I hope the judges were not timed when they were there to award the restaurant 2 Michelin Stars.Cheer
4
I went for lunch in this top end two Michelin stars rated chinese restaurant. Ambience and food as well as service was outstanding and to expecation. Only the wine list does not reflect the quality of food
4
This is our third visit and the standard of food is maintained. We were served by Katherine who was very attentive and friendly. However, we were quite puzzled by the dress code imposed by the restaurant as we saw a few diners turned up in shorts but were still admitted.
4
Excellent food, everything was tasty!.. very good atmosphere, some guest were underdress for the place (Shorts/Tshirt for dinner), Im fine with it, but it diminish the restaurant status
4
Was hosted to corporate lunch here. The restaurant's 2 Michelin Star rating stood out in the menu and service. Good selection of soup, London Duck and Mapou Tou Fu with rice.
5
Service and food was fantastic as always. All the staff are really good but the trainee Yen in particular was a stand. He has served us a few times before and incredibly remembered all of our preferences for drinks. Made use we were well looked after and did not have to ask for anything. He always has a smile on his face and is eager to help
4
It's a great place for quality food and ambiance.Specially great to entertain business guests.Only qualm I had was they served a chipped bowl.I think with the standard and $$$, it's not really acceptable
5
I brought my partner to the restaurant for surprise dinner date. We love the ambience and the decoration in the restaurant. It didnt feel like it was a chinese restaurant. We asked for recommendation of food (especially when my partner cannot take too spicy food) and were pleased with the food. I must say the food is not as authentic as mainland sichuan dishes which were famous for very spicy and very oily. Dishes were afterall reinvented by the japanese chinese chef to suit Japanese and Singaporean tastebuds. But we enjoyed our food. the staff were very polite and attentive. One of the staff actually came up to give us other recommendation when we ordered something that she felt may not suit us. She also give us a brief history of the restaurant. Love how the staff interacts with the guest. The restaurant gave us a parking coupon too
5
tasty food and great atmosphere, be sure to get a window seat for an excellent city view from the window.perfect for family or friend gatherings, so you get to share and try various of their signature dishes in one time

Shisen Hanten is the only Chinese restaurant in Singapore with two Michelin stars. You will see why after you have tried the food. The mapo doufu is outstanding and the spice/oil level is just perfect! They have value for money set meals during lunch, to sample a variety of dishes
5
We had a great time at this wonderful restaurant. Staff were attentive. Food was exceptionally good, in due reflection of its 2 Michelin stars. Beautiful ambience and well appointed setting. We were fortunate to have the chef come out after our meal - and we were able to personally compliment him for a wonderful meal
4
I am a fan of Chef Chen Kentaro's father, Chef Chen Kenichi. After tasting the food in Shisen Hanten Singapore, I am now a fan of Chef Chen Kentaro.The food is catered towards the international palate. The dishes are not as spicy as I expected but retain the other characteristics of Szechuan Cuisine. Service is good too. The Foie gras chawanmushi with crab roe soup is one of the best soup I had. However it is so good that it will overwhelm the taste of the other dishes.The mapo tofu came last, after we finished our steam rice. I believed they did not want to serve it as the table is full. However serving such a signature dish last after we finished our rice, and stomach full, the dish did not excite me. The next time I visit Shisen Hanten I will request for the mapo tofu to be served together with the rest of the dishes
3
This restaurant has really nice view. Staffs are kind. The signiture fried noodle has a racy flavor but really good to try.
5
Simple dishes yet delightful & delicious. The mapo tofu is a must-try in this restaurant. Definitely no regrets.
4
Food are good. Need to book early. Always fully seated. Normal service. Would go for another time to try more
5
Had a fantastic dinner as always. I try and visit the restaurant as often as possible when in Singapore. Service is great as always. Yen in particular is wonderful - he is always so helpful, smiling, friendly and wanting to do the best he can. Very sad that he is going to be moving to the bar instead - huge loss for Shisen Hanten. It will not be the same coming along and not having him serve us. I do not have enough good things to say about the restaurant and the service Yen provides (event though he is still in training)
4
Brought my foreign friend for dinner. Food was good, ambience was nice and service was above average. My friend loves it. Overall, very good experience
4
Whilst visiting Singapore a very dear fried invited us and our children to dinner at this 2 star Michelin restaurant and he chose the menu.  What a delightful evening with some lovely food !It is a combination of Japanese and Sechezhaun cooking !From the chicken first dish to the mango pudding everything was well prepared and beautiful presented. My favourites were the duck pancake and the black vinegar sweet and sour pork. Our final dish before dessert was a tofu very spicy dish with rich. Having never eaten tofu I was pleasantly surprised at how light it is and the dish was just spicy enough.The restaurant is on the 35 floor of the Mandarin Orient hotel is a discreet quiet restaurantWell worth a visit
5
This was tremendous. Me and my wife indulged in the weekend buffet and we were very very satisfied.The staff were attentive and courteous. The decor and ambience charming, and the food delicious.I get that not all experiences are uniform but reading some of the other reviews make me wonder if we were at the same restaurant. I'll sure be going back next time I'm in Singapore!!
1
Wow...but not in a good way, took my wife to Shisen Hanten on Sunday, hoping that the combination of our two favourite foods, dim sum and Sichuan cuisine in a two michelin star restaurant would be that dream lunch...If our food experience is anything to go by I am absolutely stunned that this restaurant was included on any list never mine achieving a 2* rating.The generic, poorly plated dim sum was average at best ( poor in comparison to Cherry Garden, who have a similarly priced offering on a Sunday) and the tasting dishes which are taken from the main menu, were the worst Sichuan inspired dishes i have every tried, zero chili, zero pepper, zero seasoning, it was alsmost as though the Chef had taken the weekend off and let the pot washer have a go...!I did miss a call from the restaurant on Sunday evening, i wonder if that was a follow up to apologise to all guests who ate there that day as I am sure i am not the only one who would have been very disappointed with there meal
4
We went to this restaurant for dinner with my wife. The Ambience is cosy - but not amazing - and the service is fine.We are big fan of Sze chuan restaurant so we tried several of the "chef's recommendations".Overall everything was quite good and tasty but not worth 2 stars from Michelin (maybe 1 star or a "bib gourmand" would be more appropriate). We tried some other Sze chuan restaurants in the region, which were better with only 1 stars or even no star at all.Price wise this is not cheap for Chinese restaurant - we paid 110SGD per person with 1 glass of wine
4
Quality of food is good. Ambience cosy and service is attentive. Maybe menu should change as we feel after quite sometime still the same. Otherwise pleasant dining experience. Will return again
4
Very nice view. The dim sum is good and nice too. The service if the staff is attentive too. There is a promotion for the dim sum from credit card company. Good to see this.
3
Not sure how this resturant has getting the 2 stars from Michelin, however personaly I felt this is overrated, the food quality are average but good presentaion, in such place they even charge you S$2.00 for order a warm water for my sis in law who has pregnant. I went to other place like Fullerton hotel don't remember they charge me for order a warm water.The trainee who served us name call "Yeng or Yen"( not sure, anyway a young boy), very good attitude and service, better than the other staff
4
I have been coming to Shisen Hanten a few times since they open! I was surprised and delighted when they received michelin stars! The place is beautiful with grand chandeliers and the food is refined (for Sze chuan style food) and delicious! Views are beautiful and service is good. Only thing is I feel the lighting is way too bright! If it was slightly dimmer, the ambiance will be more relaxing and enjoyable
5
Actually it was my first experience of Peking duck. The skin was very soft but crunch as well and very juicy. And the service was also nice. Especially the decanting of sommelier was wonderful. It was perfect experience
3
Food was overrated for its recent Michelin award of 2 stars. Service was poor - our order was missed despite checking it at time of order, and food took a good 30mins extra to arrive afterwards. Waitress started clearing our table without checking with us if our orders have all been served! Hot dessert then arrived semi cold after our missed order was served. Disappointing experience
4
Heard about the restaurant but only decided to try when it earned Michelin stars. The food was good and not overly expensive. Good value
4
My family and I had lunch and were a little disappointed to be honest with the restaurant. The food is fine, but there is no way this is a 2 star Michelin restaurant. There is no hint of Japanese in the food and it is clearly a Szechuan Chinese restaurant. The service is ok, not great by any means. They were out of most the menu limited sake and I had to settle for something I didn't really want. I was actually brought over a bottle of white wine as a substitute for my first choice which was unavailable, made me start to question the reliability of everything else. The products used are premium but the food is really just typical of most restaurants at a much higher cost. The plates were not cleared after we dined, menu's were only brought for a few of us and we had to request more, food that was spilled was not cleaned up on the cloth between service and the table clothes are cheap and not ironed properly. Much like the rest of Singapore's high end restaurants it's more sizzle then substance and the Michelin people have dropped the ball clearly with their selections. If this is 2 star then there must be 10 of so 3 star Chinese restaurants in Bangkok alone never mind the other excellent food available in that city. Save your money for the real thing
5
the weekend brunch is excellent value for money. Quality dimsum and nice free flow peking duck. Is it worthy of 2 stars? maybe the ala-carte but from a Chinese restaurant POV, compared to the Michelin stars Chinese restaurant I tried in Hong Kong it is at least a solid one star.
5
The restaurant looked super elegant. It was super classy with beautiful chandeliers. Customer service was awesome. They saw to your every little request. The food particularly the peking duck was just absolutely delicious and perfect. Super succulent - the crispy skin with the pancakes were just to die for. My chicken with badil leaf, wagyu beef with green pepper as well as the mushroom curry was just classic!!
4
This is the our second visit and although it is a Tue night, the place is rather packed. Our service staff, Doris, was really attentive. The food is good and well presented. Enjoyed a lovely evening.
5
We enjoyed typical Shisen foods. Every food is so nice! We strongly recommend this restraints , when you visit Singapore
3
We had a 6 pm dinner reservation at Shisen Hanten. We were intrigued with the concept of a Szechuan restaurant with a Japanese chef. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with a very high ceiling and lovely chandeliers. They sat us at a table in the middle of the room because most tables are for four or more people. We were the first diners in the cavernous, empty room. The next diners were seated in a table right next to ours. We had corn and crab soup that was similar to that in Cantonese restaurants and London duck, which was new to us. We ordered prawns with asparagus and truffle, but we really couldn't taste the truffle. When ordering dessert, we asked what was warabi mochi. The two waitresses consulted with each other for a long time and said it was mochi with a sweet sauce. I ordered it, and they came back later and said they didn't have any. They offered umeshu plum wine only by the bottle and not by the glass. My wife had mango pudding and I had Hokkaido vanilla sea salt ice cream which were both excellent. Probably because of what we ordered, the cuisine seemed Cantonese rather than Szechuan or Japanese. The servers were friendly, helpful, and attentive. The price was a bit high considering that the dishes were good, but none seemed special
4
The interior decor was opulent. Service was excellent. As my mum is quite elderly n using a walking stick, the waitress offered to provide a chair lift to bring my mum up n down the flight of steps which I thought was really helpful. Very impressed
4
Good food , good service. The portion is a bit small for me. But lucky the experience is fantastic .the waiting time need to be improved, wait for a long time for food to be served
5
The food was to an exceptionally high standard. The portions were generous and there was nothing left. We all thoroughly enjoyed the lunchtime dining experience
5
After booking into the Orchard Mandarin hotel in Singapore, we were looking for a top-end restaurant to celebrate an anniversary. The hotel recommended the Shisen Hanten Szechwan restaurant in the hotel.We has a great meal and a lovely celebration. The food was superb. We had the 'Foie gras chawanmushi with crab roe' soup. I have never tried this, but was pleasantly surprised at its complex flavours. The main courses were not as spectacular as the soup, but none of the food was below standard. The 'fried pork in sweet and sour sauce in black vinegar' is also a highlight. The other food worth trying is the 'stir-fried tofu in hot Szechwan pepper-flavoured meat sauce'. This was wonderfully hot (spicy) and had a lovely The decor is modern which I was not expecting from a traditional Szechwan restaurant. There were no where enough serving staff and there was quite a wait for our food to come from the kitchen. The actual waiters who served us were warm and very friendly. Their English was not as good as most restaurants in Singapore. This was not a bad thing as it is a restaurant aimed at local people rather than western tourists. We were the only westerners eating there.If you are looking for a genuine Szechwan restaurant rather than a western copy give this a try

Hadley buffet lunch on Sunday with family. Food was of a very high standard, especially the Peking duck which the kids enjoyed tremendously. Service was a little slow even though the restaurant wasn't full but that could be due to it being understaffed.. Waitresses were all extremely pleasant and helpful even though they were extremely busy. Good value for money. Will come again for sure

Fantastic food and value. Service could be improve with knowledge of food. The ambience of the place is beautiful but never expected szechuan food to be refreshing

This restaurant sounds more japanese than chinese. The food is surprisingly good. At sgd50 ++ , the menu was extensive. Peking duck roll, deep fried prawn dumplings, spicy prawn with chilli, scallop with brocoli , salmon and tuna sashimi.. Wow. It was quite worth my money. Staff members were friendly and attentive. Good view of town .

First dish came after 30 minutes and it wasn't even the appetizer.How long does it take to cut roast meat? Duck and pork were tasty but the char siew was hard.All the dishes were all either very salty or cloying in taste.Ordered a second helping of rice as it was impossible to eat the dishes on their own.The second serving was half the first but the cost was the same.Very disappointed and never going back nor will recommend

Located on the 35th Floor of the Mandarin Orchard hotel, Shisen Hanten is a Sichuan restaurant but not the usual Chinese restaurant that you would expect. The chef is the 3rd generation Chinese Japanese of Chen Kenmin who opened the first Shisen Hanten in Japan in 1958 and is known as the Father of Sichuan cuisine. The current chain of restaurants in Japan is helmed by the son, Chen Kenichi, who is a known Master Iron chef. His son, Chen Kentaro, helms the restaurant in Singapore. Dishes include typical Sichuan as well as some adapted. Particularly pleased with its Mapo tofu but need to ask for less peppercorns if you cannot handle spiciness of the highest level. Another of its signature dishes is the spicy chilli fish soup which has a very unique taste sweetness, spiciness, and mala. The Gongbao chicken is done very well. The sweet and sour pork with black vinegar is another unique dish which is not quite Sichuan. This one is non-spicy. There are other non-spicy items such as Sichuan string beans with minced pork. Overall the foods were very good. The ambient is fantastic with high ceiling, luxurious hotel decor, quiet and very spacious. What is lacking is perhaps a little more attention by the service staff as the place is big and spacious and they seem to be faraway as such when you need to call for service

The restaurant gives a very exclusive feel. Very quiet and private dining experience even though we were seated in the main hall

A welcoming restaurant with nice ambience. Good presentation of food, signature dishes met expectations.

This restaurant has the BEST ever to die for Peking duck. Not only just once we went there for dinner but in fact we went there 2 times in a week.

Poor attitude of the staff along with the below par standard of food served here makes a Perfectly Rotten dining experience. And the Chef is only focused and will only communicate with Japanese.
2
All the service staff made us think that they are being forced to work without getting paid. For a renowned restaurant like this, the food is below average. Totally disappointed and feel that money is not well spent. Will never return.

My wife and I enjoyed a dinner here the other evening. The view from the dinning room was awesome and the food was even better. I had the chicken stew in a pot with yam and my wife ordered a spinach dish with her pork dish and the vegs were very good as well as my chicken stew. The pork dish Katleen was very happy with also

Just had to try the restaurant while staying at the hotel. Its constant advertisment in the lobby with tantalizing images of food was too compelling not to at least try it out. From the entrance, it was almost a "Wow" when you entered the restaurant with chandeliers dangling beautifully in the restaurant. It was beautifully appointed and elegant. I had hoped that the food would match the stunning decor and it did and more!Like the images that we saw, I had to try the chilli lobster which was to die for. Their take on sweet and sour pork with black vinegar was interesting - especially with the first few bites. After that we could not get enough.The wait lady was really good in her recommendation and everything she recommended was perfect.Overall a wonderful dinner, superb food and impeccable service. Will definitely return and recommend

Were delighted when the staff displayed the Peking Duck and then individual prepared each lovely piece of shin ready to melt in your mouth. Enjoyed local lobster which was sweeter and at a much better price than imported options. Our noodle dish was slow to arrive and the manager noted it and corrected the problem before we could even voice concern. Nice setting with chandeliers and also some views of city from a few window seats. Service was good even with a completed booked restaurant

I and my wife celebrated our anniversary at this restaurant. We stayed at Mandarin Orcard and therefeore it is convenient to have the dinner at the same property. The booking was easy and we were greeted warmly by the staffs.The restaurant was quite exclusive and classy and we really enjoyed our time there.The food and the service were excellent. The staffs were quite helpful to us. There were not many guests at the time we had our dinner.The taste of the food were magnificent. we really appreciate it.The price were also reasonable compared to the services we had.In summary, we would definetely return

Great setting and decor.Food 7/10. Would have happily gone again but .... Had festive menu which came with a promise of a discount for DBS cardholders but apparently small print somewhere not published says discount not valid on public holidays. Which festive period is not a public holiday? Charged for corkage which I agree with but restaurant has no proper wine glasses. Yet sell first growths on their menu for thousands of dollars. So in short, don't go if u r a foodie or pay for your own meals. Strictly expense account only.

I must say this has been the best chinese restaurant dinner in a long while. Would rate it above the other chinese restaurants in hotels in the Orchard area.This is authentic Szechuan cuisine done with finesse and sophistication. It will be spicy and not some dumbed down sweetened up sticky version that misrepresents Szechuan food here. The chef won us over by the first course, the soups were great and in particular the chef's recommendation, "Foie Gras Chawanmushi with crab roe soup" was a divine concoction. Make sure u order it. This is on you if you fail to order it and miss out on a great meal.Proper chongqing chinese chicken. Rich and delicate fish in spicy brothThe pork black vinegar also worked wonders to complement the spicy dishes and to kill the spice.Special mention also to the fried rice, which was infused with richness and umamiWhat was impressive was the skill, you can taste the layers of flavours.Ok desserts Good ambiance, with view from the 35th floor.Understaffed, we waited too long to be served and trainee couldn't speak english, some confusion when the desserts arrived. "Which dessert is this?" Chinese replyGood value for money especially after credit card discount

The ambiance and decor are suitable for relaxing weekend brunch or gathering with loved ones. If topped with better dishes and dimsum, this restaurant would definitely be a queue destination.
Recommended: roasterd pork and seafood fried rice.
Don'ts: kuo tie, xiao long bao

Like no other Chinese restaurant I have ever been to. Double storey ceilings with chandeliers, an air of opulence and excellence. Perfect service and amazing food made for an outstanding dining experience.

I called two days earlier to make the dinner appointment. It was meant to be a birthday treat for two of my friends as well as to try out the food. To my embarrassment, my friends arrived before me and were told there was no such reservation under my name and the place had been booked for a private event. When I arrived, no apologies were given and the lady at the counter insisted she couldn't have taken my reservation. I showed her my phone with the record of the telephone call made to the restaurant, she looked puzzled and couldn't understand why my reservation was taken. She asked me to speak to her manager who walked up and he too couldn't offer an alternative or apology. I was most upset and not impressed at the service. Is it worth visiting

The dim sums are of very normal and in fact below average for dim sums in a well establishment Mandarin Hotel. I would expect it to be of good quality dim sum as comparable to Imperial Treasure or Royal China but it wasn't. They really need to Polish up their culinary skills of their chefs who were preparing the dim sums

We had a buffet during a weekend lunch hour here. It wasn't very crowded in the restaurant, maybe because we were there for the 2nd reception instead of the first. First thing we noticed was the extremely warm service that the staff provided us with. Food quality was excellent too. This restaurant is located on the 35th floor of Mandarin Orchard. A must-try

It was a farewell dinner for one of my friends who is moving to New York for good and I wanted to treat him to a good Chinese restaurant before he leaves. My initial thought of this restaurant was somewhat fazed by the mixed reviews in the forum but I decided to give it a go and called to make a reservation. Our Shisen Hanten experience started once we step out of the elevator. We were well received by the staffs and were ushered to the table, making us feel like VIPs of the restaurant. The staffs were genuine in their service and made us feel welcomed. Upon entering the restaurant ground, we were in awed by the high ceiling that is filled with many chandeliers. The decor is very swanky i should say! We started ordering and we were recommended to try their signature Mapo Tofu and the Stir-fried chicken with cashew nuts and chilli pepper. We thought 2 dishes were not enough but were assured that the portion will be sufficient for the 3 of us and indeed, it was very filling (you have to pair it with their hokkaido pearl rice too)! We ended the meal with cold almond pudding and mango pudding. The texture was silky and together with the taste, we find the puddings very balanced and delightful. Towards the end before we leave, the staffs presented my friend a farewell cake which came as a surprise and wishes him well in his future endeavors. This additional touch of service was uncalled for and I am impressed by their attention even to the minute detail in my phone call when making the reservation for my friend's farewell dinner. 5* for their service!Having tried so many szechuan restaurants in the world, I personally feel that Chef Kentaro had succeeded in blending the traditional szechuan taste to our Singaporean palate. Not all can accept the szechuan numbing spiciness but I believe that as long as you request for the right level of spice to your food, you will definitely have an appetizing meal for sure. Just like we we had at Shisen Hanten. =

Enjoyed our late afternoon visit here after shopping along orchard road. This restaurant on the 35th level of the mandarian hotel provides some space from the busy shopping street below. The food was very tasty, we tried the peking duck, a prawn dish which had lovely cooked prawns however the plate was a little sparse, and lovely house chillian red wine which was surprisely good. Overall we would visit here again
