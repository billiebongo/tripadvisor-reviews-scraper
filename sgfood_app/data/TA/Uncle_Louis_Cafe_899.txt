Have you ever wonder where can I get nice, delicious and satisfying Chinese meals and yet at reasonable price?I was looking around in Singapore for the answer to the above questions. I found it. It is Uncle Louis Cafe 899. A nice spacious inside sitting and an airy space outside. It is a good place for family, friends or meeting place. You can relax, enjoying the good food, and have nice time with your people around.Uncle Louis is a friendly, helpful and accommodating guy. He can "twist" and whip up any food of your suggestion and choice.Let me introduce a few nice and delicious dishes I had tried. Pork ribs saute'ed just right for d taste buds. Yam basket... Light crisp and crunchy. Yum, yum.... Succulent, when your teeth say "Hi!" to d fresh prawns , onions and chillies. The butter sauce crabs will send you high as though YOLO. The Dou miaow....El dente.The price is also reasonable. Now whenever I visit Singapore Uncle Louis Cafe 899 I will go. He deserve the advertisement because people should not miss the good food and reasonable price of food in Singapore
