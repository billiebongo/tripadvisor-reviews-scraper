We walked around the complex looking to try new and tasty foods. We notice there was a small line for this stall, therefore we thought it must be good. The food was tasty and fresh - as it is cooked in the stall.

This stall is owned/run by a nice & friendly young couple from Shangdong, China. The cook is the man himself.The food is simple, hearty home-cook types. Taste very good. Nothing fanciful. No expensive stuff like fish, prawns, beef etc. Just simple & affordable good food.Regular dishes include braised pork belly, curry chicken, pork & chicken chops, stir fried bean curd, last fingers & beans, meat balls, braised pig trotters & more. Some dishes are available only sometimes eg chicken feet, curry vegetables (cabbage), steam egg with tofu, etc.For $3, you get 1 meat & 2 vegetables dishes. There are many regulars here. Usually there is constant queue after opening. Crowded during lunchtime.Come about 11.00-11.30 am, otherwise not many dishes are ready. Sometimes they come late, so it takes longer to cook. They close at about 7pm or earlier if good sold out. Closed on Saturdays
