This stall is very popular and you have to be prepared to join a long queue if you visit during the peak lunch hour. The deep fried pork chop cut into slices is very popular and the so called set consists of rice, pork chop, Hainanese curry and a runny fried egg. All for $3.30. If you add fish or prawns or chicken, the cost goes up significantly. The stall is closed on Friday and is open for dinner as well, closing at around 8 pm

I go to Hainanese Curry Rice Stall at one of the mall in Orchard. There are a lot of menu options like Fried Fish Set, Chicke Drumstick Set, Fried Prawn Set, etc and the price is very affordable. The portion is also enough for one person, not to much or less, delicious and authentic, I mean that even though you are Asian, European or Western I think that you will like the taste
