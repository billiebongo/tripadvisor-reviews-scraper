Review by DrSim001. Good food. Air-conditioned. Basic ambience. Nothing fancy. Services is basic but acceptable. Try the prawn roll, pork belly bun, fish maw soup. Limited parking outside. Regards DrSim001

Traditional restaurant serving authentic and very reasonably priced Hokkien dishes. Its nostalgic interior is in need of an update but will probably go well with those looking for lost memories of yesteryear.

Nice hokkien tzi char w aircon, clean tablecloth but at affordable prices. Will come again w family to try more dishes. Nice hokkien noodles, pork belly buns. Avg prawn rolls though.

We had the fish maw soup, pork with buns, hokkien noodles, ngor hiang and the food was just awesome. The place looks pretty run down but dont let that fool you. The food is real authentic for sure.

An old restaurant which serves hokkien dishes. . Overall the food can be better if it is serve piping hot...Chinese food if not serve hot will not give out its best favor. .

Reasonably priced Hokkien food. The noodles are all good, steam fish is nice too. Kong Ba Bao is very tasty too. Standard drop slightly over the years and price increased moderately too. But all in all still better than average food. The seafood Fish maw soup is recommended too

Brought friends from overseas to this restaurant over a Sunday afternoon. Booked 2 days in advanced as it is always pack during weekends. Generally all the dishes in the photos are nice, but the hokkien noodles is a bit salty. The price is ok. No strange smell encountered as stated by another reviewer. My friends enjoyed the food.

4 of us had lunch on a Sunday and we ordered their Hokkien noodle, prawn ngor heng, yam ring, braised pork with bun & a vegetable dish. The portions are big enough to feed 5 pax, truly filling. We love the food, there is an element of nostalgic touch & taste. Will definitely go back & try again, as some items on the item have to be pre-ordered

Came here 2 years ago to celebrate my dad's birthday and pre ordered Buddha Jumps Over the Wall. It was so delicious and at reasonable price.Here again, the food is still very good. This restaurant should be rated one of the top 10. Not many traditional Hokkien restaurant out there anymore, this is one of the few left. Before it is gone, go try it out!Must order their Hokkien Noodle

Tucked in a shop house at Jalan Besar, this is a good find. It was near Chinese New Year, so we ordered the set menu. We love the steamed pomfret which is very fresh, light yet tasty. Should also try their signature prawn roll with pig liver
