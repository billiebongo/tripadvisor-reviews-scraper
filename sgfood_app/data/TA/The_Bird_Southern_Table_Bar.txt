We stopped by for a late dinner, although the service was very good, the food really was nothing to write home about, the waiters build up on the fried chicken did not turn out, also no sides at all, just chicken! Quite pricey too
5
Nice location at the event plaza in Singapore. Stopped for drinks during happy hour and the beer and wine was reasonably priced @ 10 sgd (pretty good for Singapore) Food looked good but didn't have any this time. Would recommend for a visit if your in the area
4
We were able to get reservations easily on Open Table, which worked out well. Had a great seat for people watching, we weren't rushed and the service was spot on. Enjoyed a flight of infused whiskies but the toasted pecan was the best. Deviled eggs were very good, the salmon roe was a unique touch. The Fried Chicken is wonderful, I don't know that it is marinated in but it was tender and juicy, even the white meat. If you like cornbread, the jalapeno cornbread was delicious
4
The design of this restaurant was really interesting and welcoming. It is located in the Marina Bay Shoppes. It is the first restaurant in Asia for this Southern, American restaurant and they have some unusual flavour pairings e.g blackberry Bourbon lemonade. We had two drinks and the truly excellent Swine Burger with fries. The burger was made with short rib, brisket & chuck blend with House smoked belly pork, American cheese and dressings.

Happen to stop at this wonderful little restaurant/bar on the Bayfront. Sat on the outside with a good view of the light show at night. The food was wonderful and the service was the best. Our server Jerry, was most helpful, quick and a wealth of knowledge
5
Good staffs, great ambience & superb service! You can also use sands rewards card here. Craft beers a lot of them from lightest to strong.
5
Made a return trip, but for dinner this time. The menu was different from the one served at lunch so we had a chance to try some other dishes. The St Louis Style Pork Ribs were absolutely delicious. You could taste the smokey flavour and the meat was so tender that it literally fell off from the bone. The Wagyu Sirloin Steak is another must try. The chef had it cooked just right, retaining all the juiciness of the yummy meat. For fish lovers, I would recommend the Skillet Seared Snapper which was also very nice. Besides the entrees, there are also appetizers such as Fried Green Tomato & Crispy Pork Belly, Buttermilk Biscuits and salads such as The Wedge worth considering. It would be wise to make a reservation as the restaurant was absolutely packed that evening when we were there

We’re expats living in the middle east, and came upon the restaurant while on vacation in Singapore. Needless to say, it more than fulfilled all our cravings for good craft beer and southern food! Amazing selection of drinks (specialty bourbons and whiskey as well as a huge selection of US beer by the bottle and on tap) but the food blew us away. We had oysters, biscuits, shrimp and grits, fried chicken and coleslaw and our kids had the mac and cheese. Every single dish was absolutely amazing. Still thinking about those biscuits- order them, you won’t be disappointed, better than most we’ve had in the south! Only critique- we were there on a Saturday night and service was a little slow, perhaps understaffed? Would’ve tried dessert if it had been a but quicker but ran out of time
5
the low + slow cooked chicken salad was really great! nice spot even though someheavy construction work was going on at the basement level (most likely this wasnt in control of the restaurant
5
We wanted something other than fish, so googled and came up with this restaurant.Lovely food and the portions are large as well.Our host Jerry was very informative......he told us about the ingredients in each dish.Overall a great place
4
At least when we were there, this is down at the less active end of the vast mall, and signage for venues is scarce, so it was a bit hard to find. However, once there, it does have a nice vibe and the staff was very friendly and efficient. If this is your first night in town, the pricing may shock you, especially for beer, wine, and cocktails. Most beer runs about S$20, and cocktails are S$27 and up. However, the cocktails are made with precision and are quite good. We had two food items off the starters menu, the burnt ends and the fired chicken biscuit. The burnt ends were pretty good, if a bit rich due to the blue cheese sauce. However, the fired chicken biscuit was disappointing, with the piece of chicken thigh being a bit tough, and the biscuit dry. Most entrees are in the S$40-60 range. However, you do get a 15% discount on everything if you are staying at the Marina Bay Sands hotel
5
My friends and I went there just last month. We ordered two of the Chef's Tasting Set Menu for three to share and added just one Chicken ‘n’ Watermelon ‘n’ Waffles for two to share, and added the Skillet Seared Snapper. Everything we had was delicious. Well worth what we paid for. Do make reservations though as it was very busy during dinner time. Service was good and efficient despite peak hours
3
Overall the food was average and on the salty side. i have ordered a wagyu steak and it was extremly salt and was told because of the salt crust on the steak. the service was a meh. Desssert wise the Peach cobbler was a good choice
1
32 Singapore dollars for a single beer (thats 2o euros or 18 pounds). This is beyond the richter scale even for singapore. While i understand its legal and I guess I could have asked for the price before ordering the most expensive beer not juat that I drank but that I have ever heard off. Similar estbliahment on the same road charge a lot less so tjis came as a total surprise. Its absolutely ridicoulous
5
Perfect position in front of light display! Super friendly staff Gerry, Mika, Joanna. 1/2 price cocktails on Tues 6-9pm. Delicious food- especially the burgers and amazing desserts! Would highly recommend stopping here for a meal!!
5
We have breakfast here three consecutive days during our stay at Marina Bay Sands. Staff was very friendly, breakfast menu variable, and very unusual deserts. One of them attached on the picture below.
3
Love that the place cater to gluten free requests. Great service from all the staff from front desk to wait staff, team lead and managers. Good atmosphere but could do with better music playlist that reflects the theme - sweet home Alabama or something. They were playing Michael Jackson and ABBA. The only gripe we have is the expensive drinks and food. Not so much the food price but portions were really small and not enough to share. We are light eaters and even then we found the portions miserly
4
This is a great place for groups and catching up with friends. It's the sort of place where there are lots of fun dishes you can order, share tastes and experiences. The food is Southern American - which may seem a little unusual to choose in Singapore but hey, sometimes you want to step away from classic Asian and let's just say this place gives a whole new meaning to Southern fried chicken. The flavours and menu options are really interesting. There is a lot of fried stuff, of course including chicken, and limited options for people requiring a gluten free option, but everything is very yummy and easy to divide up between friends. Corn also plays a major part on the menu and the macaroni cheese is delicious. There are cocktails to spice things up and the service was very friendly at all times. This place is well worth a visit if you want a hit of fried food with a difference
2
Greasy atmosphere which makes your hair and clothes stink. Server was not attentive when my friend arrived, she did not bring her a glass even when I've already ordered a bottle of sparkling water on the table. Despite telling her time and again that I'm allergic to cheese, she took our dessert order and served a butterscotch cake (on the menu, there was no mention of cheese) with cheese icing all over. Chicken with Waffles priced at $45 is seriously overpriced. Chicken was too salty. On the whole, this place is overrated
4
Came here with my husband during our stay at MBS. Delicious food and great drinks. We had been to the one in Vegas so we knew what to expect. Get the biscuits, the wedge salad and the friend chicken. All Expensive but great
4
Located near the Marina Bay, by the water, this bar enjoys a good view of the waterfront, as well as the accessibility being next to MBS. Chill place with your standard drinks, able to sit large groups of people.
3
If you're looking for Southern American fare, this is the place. We loved the crab cakes and devilled eggs. The ribs and chicken were good too.
5
Ambience Food Service Decided to popby The Bird on New Year's Day for our first meal of the year and wow we didn't regret our choice! From their Southern Fried Chicken to their waffles, house blend lemon tea etc, everything is seriously a must try :) Their fried chicken were non oily and still crispy even being left on plate after some time Recommendations: Fried chicken, bacon hash waffles, in-house special lemon teaDefinitely will be back to try on other dishes and of course the fried chicken again!
5
Excellent coffee and tea with southern biscuits. Beautiful setting, good background music and friendly service.
4
Tried their hamburger on recent visit and it was really nice and juicy. The meat was not overdone and was tender. The portion was generous and big enough to fill me up. My wife had the Southern Fried Chicken and their in-house baked soft biscuits. These were just as delicious. Last, but not least, the service was good here. Service staff were very attentive to our needs and were serving with a smile
5
Went for Xmas Lunch at this restaurant today. Wonderful and friendly service. The food was absolutely delicious and well presented. The standard of food was really good, freshly cooked. One of the dishes wasn't quiet cooked properly so we showed the waiter, he took it away and told us that they will make it again for us. They have such a wonderful attitude towards their customers. Offered us to have something else while they prepared the dish again and really handled the situation very well. 5 stars for providing excellent customer service. Would strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore as you will be guaranteed a friendly service with a smile
3
Nice location, nice menu ideas and excellently friendly staff - but the food itself is overpriced even if you consider the prime location. You ecpect more than cheap bar fries and waffles that lack texture at this price point, If you are around to shop jump in for a quick bite, but dont expect to be blown awa
5
We had a great dinner here while in Singapore. The atmosphere is casual and fun. Since we were at the Bird, we had to have the Southern Fried Chicken - it was very good and came to the table in a bucket. We also had amazing soft biscuits. It was a great meal and highly recommended. We almost came back the next day just for the biscuits
5
This popular restaurant is found in the Marina Bay Sands Shopping Centre. Being a tad early for lunch we popped in, lucky we did the restaurant filled up immediately. Service was spot on, lots of interesting drink choices, served ice cold and in trendy glasses. We ordered 2 entrees to share as well as mains consisting of the fried chicken and a cold chicken salad. All super tasty. Even though the restaurant was full we never felt rushed and enjoyed a leisurely lunch before departing to the airport for our night flight home
5
We had an excellent experience at The Bird Southern Table and Bar in the MBS - with great service, great food, and decent prices. We brought the entire family to try out a mix of Chicken and waffles, cornbread, chopped salad, cole slaw, and even a kids burger - and all items were seasoned nicely, prepared professionally, and most importantly very tasty! And that fried chicken - holy cow!!! We’ve been to several restaurants in the MBS - and we think the Bird is an excellent sit-down casual restaurant. We prefer this definitely over Bread Street - because of service, food, and atmosphere.I think it’s also one of the very few restaurants with a decent kids menu - so please enjoy!!
5
Some of he best chicken I have had. All he group agreed. Creative cocktails, service great and fast, appis were great. Only criticism is expensive wine and small list.
4
It was very hot in Singapore the day we visited this area, we needed something to eat and The Bird was ideally situated on the Bayfront outside the Shoppes. We only had salads so cannot comment on hot dishes, but we enjoyed them and were refreshed in the air-conditioned restaurant, there are tables outside also.Service was friendly and the ambience of the restaurant is good.Prices are a little high but you are in a reasonably affluent place of Singapore close to The Shoppes, Casinos, and Sands Hotel
3
Whenever I eat out, my main focus is the food itself; in this regard, 'The Bird' is frankly disappointing. Two of us ordered 'The Great American Burger' at $26 each. We were offered a choice of either fries (ok) or salad to accompany, yet at this price, both should come as standards. The hubris of places like this genuinely annoys me, bordering on 'the emperor's new clothes'. A case in point is the unwarranted use of 'great' to describe average quality and relatively small burgers. My friend described them as 'lousy', which I actually found too harsh. The other three members ordered small dishes, yet the ones which stood out were chicken wings cooked in dubious oil (as per burgers) and overly salted; far better results at Chomp Chomp Hawker Market without the pretention. The drinks list offers a wide range of wine, but only a limited selection of overpriced beer, eg. $28 for a 0.5L American White Beer. Sitting outside in this location was admittedly very pleasant, the service professional and attentive. However, overall my assessment: 'You can put lipstick on a pig, yet it's still a pig'. I will definitely not be back
3
American fried chicken at is best with nice service and good atmosphere. The menu is approachable for everyone; don’t miss the chicken. Portions can be generous specially the main courses. Only one negative note that I really don’t understand: the floor vibrates every few minutes and after a short while it’s quite disturbing.
3
Went there for lunch with friends... Tried the chicken sandwich ($20)and the signature chicken with water melon and waffles ($45) The sandwich chicken was hard, dry and rubbery. I had to pull really hard to break it to small piece. The signature chicken with watermelon tastes bland and lacks of flavour. The waffles were okay and moist..it is the best part in fact , better than the chicken.The staffs are informative and helpful although the payment process was slow (15 mins). Overall food taste is not worth the price we paid
3
I was there recently for the executive lunch set ($40++). Walked in without a reservation and the restaurant was rather empty. Service was impeccable with waiting staff constantly coming to check on us. I ordered the lunch set special - fried chicken - for main and I must say I was hugely disappointed by the portion size. The buttermilk biscuits were not tasty (Popeye's and Texas Chicken's are way much better). The starter was nice and desserts were yummy but overall I don't think this restaurant warrants a repeat visit
5
Decided to walk into this amazing looking place for dinner. We had the shrimp and the fried chicken. Simply delectable and the portions were huge! The service staff was quite attentive and pleasant with serving us. Good place for a warm cosy environment esp when dining with friend and family.
5
Thank you Jersey and Maria for the excellent service ! Maria was friendly and passion! We enjoyed the butterscotch cake definitely will be back again. thanks again for Kim and Michael who have sings the birthday songs for Alvin.

I decided to have a tour of the Marina Bay Sands luxury Mall, before leaving Singapore. It was 7 pm and I felt hungry. I walked around through the great quantity of restaurants in the mall, but this one caught my attention for the interiors and for the southern american mix in the recipes. They have a casual and yet very nice set-up. Their drinks list is very long and interesting. Nice cocktails, bourbons and whiskeys. However, since I was going to have a 7+7 hours flight with a 5 hours stop over, I decided to have just a beer, very good by the way.I went for their specialty right away, the fried chicken. They serve you half a chicken, pressure fried for 15 minutes. Well, it was so crispy and so juicy, cooked to the bones, I still have my mouth watering. That was my meal, very fast and short but very nice. Comfortably sat by the window with a view on the mall 1st floor corridor (inside), well served and nicely taken care of. Try it! They said they have another one in Miami, that’s where all started.
3
Family dinner after recommendations from friends. Attentive and knowledgeable service staff. Menu is long on drinks and limited on food options. Starters we had were great - crab cakes and fried green tomatoes with pork belly. We had the signature main course of fried chicken with watermelon cubes and waffles. We realised you can have the fried chicken only option. Had macaroni with cheese and cole slaw with a thinly fried chicken skin. For those who drive, you can get complimentary car parking if you spend more than S$150 before all the taxes, half the amount at lunch
4
Nice place to have my Sunday brunch, I like the interior design style and enjoy the food...planning to come again and try more cocktail/alcohol drinks...简洁不简单，喜欢的装修风格，轻松自在、享受生活， 周末休闲早午餐好去处。计划下次再去试试各种鸡尾酒🍸威士忌🥃，价格对比国内同等水准并不高，旅行住金沙的小伙伴们可以来试试
1
We had a work dinner with a preset menu - all courses - no choices - how hard can that be to serve together and without ridiculous delays?The oysters were nice - two - the rest of the courses not so. On booking we were told we would have some options to chose from - when we got there all four courses were already chosen. The fried chicken and waffles were terrible - some pieces over and dry- others almost raw. And two of our table waited so long for theirs to come that the rest were cold when they did. Servers were not around to take drinks orders - terrible. We had one vegetarian and one gluten free - basically they left the waffle off the chicken and the vegetarian was mediocre at best - my collogue left more than she at
4
Called in here for drinks as the place we had planned to have drinks was very busy. Was served by a very attentive barman who gave us a good overview of the drinks on offer and we settled for a draft IPA and a hazelnut brown beer. Drinks were good and the bar was very relaxed; would call in again but it was our last night in Singapore. Whilst we didn't eat here, the food looked good
5
Entertaining guests from out of town along with some folks from SG, we had a great experience. The food and service and ambience was great. The brussel sprouts surprisingly awesome. Try the Crossroads
4
Had a really good gathering over a nice dinner at THE BIRD ~ â™¡ The ambience was awesome and it was not very crowded during night time as well. The food were delicious but the prices are not very friendly for our wallets. The food portions are relatively big (actually huge for me), so i will recommend sharing of main dishes in case you have a smaller appetite like me =
5
We dined at The Bird for Saturday Brunch after a mix up with a reservation at Spago, Marina Bay Sands...We were so glad for the mix up at Spago as this is a hidden gem with great offerings. While others have made comments about it being expensive, we'd disagree as 1) You're in Singapore and 2) You're in Marina Bay Sands!As the saying goes 'Nice things cost money' and in our opinion the prices here reflect the quality of the food, the service and the setting. We had 'Mama's Biscuits' with Crispy Chicken and pepper jelly which was fantastic.Our friend had the Chicken & Waffles with watermelon and commented how good it was after having had similar dishes in the USA. We shared Mac and Cheese, as well as the Bacon Hash Waffle - WOW - the bacon hash was to die for! The Mac and Cheese was ok, but a bit rich for us.Even though we were pretty full after lunch, my wife and I paired up to tackle dessert and shared the Flower Pot Mississippi Mud Pie, which was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked!We can't recommend this place enough and will DEFINITELY be visiting again on our next trip to Singapore, one of our fondest memories of this trip hands down
4
15% discount is provided to MBS hotel guests who charge back to their room. This we learnt days after we paid. Highly recommend burnt ends , very tasty. And of course the signature chicken is a must! This restaurant has fantastic service the meal was delicious but very overpriced however you will find that's MBS. Most dining facilities are over priced. Great decor and ambience.
5
Great food and even better service. Big portions and a good selection so that no one leaves unsatisfied. Spoilt for choice with the drinks selection too. A must visit in MBS
5
We've been to The Bird twice now and it is becoming a favourite of ours! The fried chicken is superb and the Mac & Cheese is the best i've tasted in a very long time Very interesting men Staff are very friendly and efficient
5
The fit out of this restaurant is great. Loved all the bourbon bottles styled into lighting fixtures. The service was friendly, efficient and not rushed. We love Southern Food and there are a lot of things on the menu to get you excited. We started with the Fried Green tomatoes with pork belly, it was an interesting combo but delicious! We then had a 1/2 serve of the fried chicken, it was well cooked and also delicious. Don't go in thinking it will be like KFC because it's not, combined with the home made hot sauce it is a real treat. We also had a wedge salad and the pork ribs. Everything was very nice and I would definitely return. Our bill was SGD 300, 100 SGD was on the wine but I still think SGD 200 warrants a fine dining category
3
Good food, love the fried chicken. The only thing missing, is the service, which was lacking and most importantly lacked any soul and engagement.
4
We came here for lunch to try the famous fried chicken. My partner was a bit disappointed as there wasn’t a lot of selection for that in the lunch menu (more ion the dinner menu). Anyway, we tried some other dishes including the crispy pork belly, crispy chicken & beef brisket biscuits (looked more like sliders to me) and bacon hash waffle. All were nice. The bar was better. A great range of whisky’s from around the world (along with other spirits) but what stood out for us was their infused bourbon whiskies. We had the apple infused, bacon infused and chocolate infused whiskies as a taster. Very nicely done and very enjoyable. They also gave me a taste of their toasted pecan infused whisky. Definitely worth trying if you go there. Have them neat (straight up) with maybe a few drops of water to open them up. Really great!To the scores:Food - 7 out of 10 (What we had was nice but we were a bit disappointed with selection {or lack thereof} of the southern fried chicken)Drinks - 10 out of 10 (Great range. Good innovation with the infusions)Service - 9 out of 10 (The service was great. Very attentive staff)Ambience - 9 out of 10 (Great setting for the type of establishment that it is)Value for Money - 8 out of 10 (Not what you would call general restaurant prices. A little higher than normal)Overall Score - 8 out of 10 (A nice place to visit

We were really excited about going to this restaurant because we live in Singapore and miss some of our native southern American dishes (we are Texans). It is evidently part of a chain of restaurants from the states called Yardbirds.We went about 11:15 in the morning on a Saturday and the menu offering was a brunch menu. We really over-ordered because we just wanted to try so many of the things that looked delicious on the menu. My husband and son ordered the chicken and waffles with spiced watermelon and I ordered the biscuits and gravy for our entrees. We also ordered buttermilk biscuits (comes with 3), macaroni and cheese, and a chicken biscuit (son really wanted this). We never really usually order entrees to share or do family style but the chicken and waffles really could have been shared since it was so large. They both enjoyed the chicken but the waffle syrup is a special blend of maple and bourbon which they both found a little strange. The biscuits and gravy comes with fried chicken, poached eggs and picked onions and it comes all piled on top of each other. I deconstructed it since I was really wanting just to simply eat biscuits and gravy and the other things separately. I really miss biscuits and gravy and I found this to be pretty good. They tell you when you sit down that if you want the peach cobbler, you need to order it early so we ordered it when we ordered our meal. It still took a long time for this to come after we had completed our main entrees and this was the biggest negative for our visit. It was good but I don't think I will be in for the wait on a return visit. We will definitely put this restaurant on our list for a return visit to try more items on the menu.
3
Decided to try out "The Bird" last Thursday (5 Oct) for dinner. Ordered Fried Green Tomato & Crispy Pork Belly, Grilled Mango Salad, Grits and the popular Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. Have to say that all dishes were delicious especially the Fired Green Tomato & Crispy Pork Belly. However, I was kind of disappointed with the Chicken 'N' Watermelon 'N' Waffles. Why? Waffles was crispy but not fluffy on the inside and wasn't warm enough when served. Of the 4 pieces of fried chicken served, the wing and drumstick was rather "dry" and the size was small "skinny" pieces. The spiced watermelon was also not red and sweet on that day. Service staff was helpful in describing the various dished ordered. However, it took awhile to present the bill when requested. I had to request for the bill twice and from 2 different staff before getting it. Overall, nice place to dine but chicken portion and service could be improved. Worth a try but not cheap
4
Went there on a Saturday evening for dinner. Was not very busy. Very friendly staff. Food was good and reasonable value. One odd thing - we ordered starters and mains with side dishes. But the side dishes for the main course were served first. Thought about sending them back, but when a bowl of fries is put in front of you, you eat them! Overall a nice experience.
4
One of the newest places to eat at Marina Bay “The Shoppes” Mall... The service is excellent, friendly and efficient.. food is excellent and very tasty.. although expensive in parts. The salads are overpriced for sure... but the Chicken is good value for the quality and taste. Quite delicious!Great cocktail list too- pricy but boozy!Recommend and definitely one of the better value restaurants in MBS as quality is excellent as is service... go take a look and eat
4
If you like southern food where meat and alcohol is in abundance and vegetables in scarce supply the bird is your go-to place. Loved the food, nice ambience (not a fan of restaurants in malls but this didn't feel awkward. The friend chicken is fab, the bourbons great and the ribs are delicious but most importantly don't forget to order the peach cobbler in advance for dessert - well worth the 20 minute wait
5
We've been to The Bird twice now and it is becoming a favourite of ours! Very interesting menu, I don't think you can get anything similar in Singapore. Food is super delicious and staff is very friendly and efficient. Also, I like the interior and the fact that you can sit outside (ground floor level) or inside at B1. We tried both and loved both. Drinks are also very good and their special sauce (honey chili something?) is yummy. We'll definitely be back for more again
4
The menu for brunch is certainly interesting but it stands up well to scrutiny. The meal was delicious and the chips better than most. Bookings are always necessary but probably a safer option if you don't want to miss out. Staff were very professional
3
The fried chicken taste good but the portion is really too small for a decent meal. You properly end up having to order 3 plates for 2 persons. And that means it will cost you a min of $60 without drinks. Unless you are entertaining or treating friends to a new eatery otherwise I do not think locals will return regularly. There are just too many other cheaper and possibly tastier fried chicken in the city.
3
Menu looked exciting. But food was average. Their "use local produces" novelty was not working for me. Especially the chicken wings, it and was of low quality. Quite disappointing.
5
Comfort food at its best! I took my teenagers here on the weekend and it was simply stunning! Felt like home cooked, soulful happy food. We all left stuffed and satisfied. We enjoyed the Carbonara - best I have ever tasted, Chicken - huge and never had spices watermelon before - stunning and the ever Favourite Mac n cheese is to die for!!! All good size portions even the sides!!!We're going back for more as looking around, all the other dishes we hadn't ordered looked amazing to. The menu was so varied we need to try it all! Located on 2nd floor of the Marina Bay Shoppes (past Gorden Ramsey Rest). A welcome addition to Singapore that everyone MUST try. Weekend Brunch, Lunch and Dinner. Great for intimate gathering or large parties, lunch or dinner the restaurant layout and wonderful decor cater for all
5
Great southern US menu. Brisket sandwich, fried chicken (of course), shrimp and grits, etc. The staff and service was great. Quite an unexpected treat for this Mississippi family.
5
Had weekend brunch at the Bird with my kids and their grandparents and it didn't disappoint. Had to try the chicken, so we ordered the chicken n watermelon n waffles and the Lewellyns fine fried chicken. It's basically the same chicken served in both dishes and it tasted good and even better with the bourbon maple syrup. The spiced watermelons were really sweet too. I ordered the shrimps n grits and classic buttermilk biscuits and they were wiped out in a flash by my kids. Had the crab cake to share but it wasn't really to my liking. Ordered 3 of out of the 6 deserts available, the flower pod mud pie was just good, but the banana pudding and the salted caramel bread pudding was great with my kid pestering for another order. Overall, a very very satisfying meal
3
This is the second time I am trying out The Bird. Service was great. Food was good. Surprising, the fried chicken was average, would have preferred a more crispy crust and smaller chicken. Crispy bacon, mac n cheese and the waffles were great. Serving size was large, great for sharing
5
Ordered a crab cake, arugula salad and fried chicken with waffles for sharing with wife. The crab cake was delicious with generous amount of crab meat. Salad was also delicious and light. Best dish for me was the fried chicken with waffles and watermelon. The chicken was tasty, tender and not oily even though it was fried. Waffles were also great and the watermelon pieces that came with it had a hint of mint and citrus taste which was refreshing. Service was also good. Will definitely visit again
4
Decided to try this place as I love Southern American Chicken We went in for a late dinner at around 10pmNice industrial chic design - staff are very friendly & happy as - great to see - GOOD ATMOSPHERE Devilled eggs - grits - mac & cheese an absolute treat Food is quite heavy though & a little expensive for what it is - Cesar salad very average One major letdown was the drink list - very overpriced with a half decent shiraz staring at $130 ++If they can get their value right then they will be on a winner !
5
Celebrated a friend's birthday here and comfort food was what we needed! So much has been said about the fried chicken and although it was tasty, I really enjoyed the Pork Ribs and the Mississippi mudpie which was in the shape of a flower in a pot!
5
Best brunch I've ever had.First meal we had when we arrived in Singapore and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. The manager was lovely, came over for a chat and didn't hesitate to recommend lots of things for us to do and other bars for us to try out whilst we were there which was great.Food was delish and as the title suggests - deep fried bloody Oreos.First thought was are you sure mate?! But we let our brunch go down and thought what the hell we are on holiday. Omg omg - best thing ever. Set us up for the day that's for sure.A shame we weren't in the city longer as we would have visited again for a dinner and cocktails.
3
The ribs were dry and full of bones (i.e the cut was wrong) the ends were not trimmed well. The chicken and waffles were ok, the syrup was put on the table but had not been wiped down so we ended up in a mess.. mind you when eating these dishes you would expect a mess, just not from the condiments. The Pandan Mule !!! well would you believe this was the absolute redemption. Go there for this!!! as the food was not worth the money.. but the cocktail was amazin
4
So it's slightly different food because we don't have that many southern American restaurants in singapore. We had a great time with southern chicken, grits and biscuits and fried green tomatoes. However it's quite heavy and not for every day eating. Great atmosphere and service
5
I was suggested here by a staff in Penhaligon's. When he said worth a money its true! We tried Chicken N Watermelon N Waffles with the price of $45 dollars it is definitely worth it. A big portion for 2. Their Honey Hot Sauce is marvelous !! You can choose either seating in or outside.. Both with a good vie
4
2yrs back when they first debuted themselves @ Epicurean Market 2015 I was not really impressed with their food samplersForward 2 yrs later and WOW the food at the restaurant is delicious. Ordered the following 1) Brisket biscuit ( really tender delicious moist brisket...they should Have brisket sandwich as a main course)2) Cucumber salad ( simple fresh salad)3) Skillet cornbread ( in the cornbread world this is die die must try!! The salty butter really enhances the cornbread flavour)4) Fried chicken ( it was hot , crispy & juicy. If there was one thing that could improve it is having it with Lingam xtra Spicy Chili sauce for the local tastebud) Will be back for more
4
Southern Fried Chicken like America. Burgers Good, Portions Good, Venue nice, good servers and staff. Small but good menu - was impressed

Read the online ads, so we decided to visit together with overseas friends. Staffs were helpful and the ambience is pleasant, trendy chic industrial look. We ordered the deviled eggs with smoked trout roe ... quite average, nothing special. We also ordered the chicken with waffles and watermelon as the staffs told us it is the signature dish. unfortunately, all of us found the chicken is moist but the taste is just average, the waffles were okay. We feel for what it is, it is not worth $45. Ordered the kale salad, portion is okay, it is not bad but nothing particularly outstanding. We expected it to be amazing... given the fact it is supposed to be the famous chicken.For the price, we would rather go to Bread street kitchen or else where. Lastly, the alcohol price is steep

Decided to try the chicken & waffles for dinner. Portion is good enough for sharing between 2 ladies. The fried chicken was nicely fried. The cauliflower mashed potato is worth a try as well, a very good mix between the 2 vegetables. Service was good. A place that I will probably just visit once due to the price for just waffles and chicken (and watermelon).

Decided to come here for lunch as it was of the few restaurants that was not crowded. Deviled Eggs ($14++)dill, chives, smoked trout roeSlightly salty but appetizing.Skillet Cornbread ($8++)vermont sharp cheddar cheese, bacon, jalapeno, honey butterIt was soft and moist, with a salty cheesy top.Chicken 'N" Watermelon "N" Waffles ($45++)honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelonvermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrupIt smelt very delicious when served. But the taste was pretty average and the meat of the drumstick was rather dark. Frozen chicken with injures? The watermelon had a minty taste. The waffle looked kind of dry, although the cheese taste was nice. I kind of wish for a huge piece of butter on the waffle

Excellent food though the biscuits could definitely be improved - certainly not light and fluffy as is typical in the Southern states.Service staff definitely need additional training. Upon arrival for late lunch the restaurant was not busy however we were not seated until we provided our name? Perhaps a different custom but strange. After we completed our meal we requested our tab and then server disappeared. After waiting for some time we inquired and we're told he was on his break. It would certainly be more service friendly if he had had another server work the table in his absence.

What a fun and delicious place! Superb food--let's underscore that. The chicken and waffles dish is a classic (do share it). Novel and delicious cocktails. Draft beer of quality. Plus a nice vibe and friendly help. Highly recommended

We dropped by here after watching Kooza next to MBS. Although we did not make any reservations, we were seated in the private room and had excellent service. We had the fried chicken (note that it comes in four pieces), swine burger and the pork ribs. The butter milk biscuit was greatly enjoyed by the girls and cool cucumber burger was great. Enjoyable meal and will definitely return.

We visited The Bird Southern Table & Bar at Marina Bay Singapore in July 2017. Its situated in a shopping Mall with an attractive frontage. Although the food & service was good we though it rather overpriced for the experience.

Beautiful setting, incredible cocktails, and the most genuine service in Singapore. Everyone was so kind and welcoming and you could truly appreciate all the time, care, and effort that goes into every drink. We look forward to a return trip to sample the food menu.

From the moment we walked in you could tell it was a well run ship. The maÃ®tre d was professional with a welcoming smile. We sat right opposite the kitchen downstairs, no view of the Bay but for us well worth it. It was great to see the Chef doing his thing and his brigade purring away. The staff were attentive but not pushy, the food came out at the same time, very unusual for Singapore. When we left we felt like we had a real food experience.I hate the fact there has to be a but, but unfortunately the burger was bland, I am being polite because we had such a great time and the chicken was a little overIs it a bit pricy for what it is, probably, but it is at MBS, and will we be going back, hell yeah, as said, we had a great time and looking forward to seeing you all soo

I have a craving for Sweet Chick in New York City and when I heard about the Yard Bird, I jumped on it. Southern food is such comfort food and The Bird Southern Table didn't disappoint. It's flavourful chicken (not too salty) is crispy. Served with nice crispy waffles (though I wished I could taste the Cheddar more), they should serve with herb butter. But the spiced watermelon with basil is super refreshing. The mac and cheese was superb. And lastly, the Salted Caramel Bread and Butter pudding is fantastic. Slightly salted, the warm bread has crispy edges but the custard is soft within. There is also a hint of bourbon or alcohol in the whipped cream. Pretty good stuff I have to say to end the meal

Impressed after arriving 7.30pm before an event without a reservation. Especially after learning the restaurant had only opened a month ago. Drawn by it laid back industrial concept but yet which had a welcoming long bar full of whiskeys. Loved there was a semi/private smaller room on left with big open area with choice of low tables, big tables for 10 and high stools. Specialised menu focused on its signature Southern fried chicken. What a lovely surprise, half chicken served as 4 huge, tender portions after being marinated 27-hrs apparently in a secret sauce. Thumbs up also for the burger which was three yummy patties! Even a simple Mac & cheese elected oohs and aahs from our tastebuds. Sad to say though the Caesar salad was a let down, leaves soggy and sauce over- powering. Knowledgeable and friendly service. Despite the place being hummingly full (watch that restaurant manager fly around clearing tables himself), we enjoyed a fast dinner with dishes arriving within 10 minutes. Will be back soon to eat at leisur

Situated right close to viewing of the light show and fireworks. I had the lewellyn fried chicken S$35 with honey hot sauce ( the signiture chicken)which was tasty and crispy on the outside. This was delicious and a good serving. Also had the mango salad and freshly made watermelon juice. Really tasty food and a great atmosphere. Service was excellent and staff and Abegaile was very attentive to our needs

Great location on the Harbor especially to watch the Saturday night light show and fireworks. Had the kale salad with fried chicken and it was very yummy. The servers were a little slow (had to ask for napkins, water, the check, etc), but overall a cute place

Went to Singapore for our anniversary and eating at The Bird in the Sands was definitely the highlight of our trip! Everything we had was amazing (including the service)! I had their signature chicken and waffles dish and it was absolutely delicious! The cocktails were also phenomenal. I'd honestly give them 10 stars if I could.

I am from the US and stayed at the Marina Bay Sands and stayed on property for most of the time i was there. I tried The Bird on my third night and LOVED every bite of food that I had. The fried chicken was the best i've ever had (don't tell my mom) and the cocktails were amazing! You must stop by and try it whenever you are in Singapore
