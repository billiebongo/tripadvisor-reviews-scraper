Food tasty with good variety, service & ambiance are good. Price reasonable for vegetarian restaurants. Must try dishes include rendang, satays, fish soup.

Very cute little restaurant, but that is where the compliments end. The food has no flavour, is soaking in oil and the staff don't even look at you.

A vegetarian friend brought us here for lunch. This is one of the best vegetarian restaurant I tried. The food here is good. The yam ring, rendang mushroom, Assam laksa, hokkien mee, ice cream sandwiches are all very good. However, the lasak is not so tasty. Can give it a miss. They have an extensive menu. The price is very reasonable.Staff are friendly & efficient. Try to make reservation if going on 1st & 15th day of the lunar calendar

It's another successful & vibrant local Singaporean vegetarian restaurant food chain in mature public housing estate near Holland Village. Almost all the local dishes like fried kwayteow and rojia etc., in vegetarian style are delicious except its cold drinks like calamansi and lemon honey are too diluted and tasteless.The restaurant is partially airconditioned and not well-furbished.Customer service needs more training and improved.Prices are otherwise reasonable if not for the smaller portions of F&B items.

It's a cosy cafe tucked in a corner of the neighbourhood. Takes about 10 minutes walk from Commonwealth MRT station and parking is convenient. The food is good but slightly small portioned. The staffs are friendly and the ambience is good. You can only pay by cash

Its a vegetarian place but I took but my family and my wifes family there and they all loved it! Mixture of veg and non veg people all giving their thumbs up. Its a mixture of Singapore and Malaysian food - there is western dishes but we didnt try them - and it was all really well done. 100% recommend this place for al

Booked this place via apps , but when we reached there, all indoor table are occupied.The staffs did not even know that we have made a booking.Fortunately, one lady that was eating alone and occupied an 8 chairs table capacities was kind enough to give up her seat.The range of vegetarian foods are quite good. U can choose from western to the traditional chinese zi char.The foods are all tasty and nice.Kudos for their rendang! We have not tried their cakes and ice cream as we were quite full. Next time probably.

A Chinese guy took the orders. Ginger Mee Sua and Margherita pizza was the pick. Ginger Mee Sua was all ginger (only). Couldn't taste anything else in that dish. Pizza was ok, although a bit cold. There was this lady staff (short hair) who was wiping the washed utensils and literally throwing them in a basket. I mean, seriously. What a turn off! There is something called kitchen in ur bistro. Have u ever thought about doing it there? Ppl come to ur place to relax and eat. Not to listen to the continuous spoon rattling nonsense! Another staff was sitting in the middle of the restaurant and coughing continuously. I understand sickness, but there s something called face mask! For someone in FnB, it's common sense to wear a head cap and a mask, especially when a staff handling food is sick. I wanted to complain to the manager or which ever person in charge, but I don't think that wud hv made a difference! I'm surprised ur bistro has a B cert

This bistro offers an excellent selection of vegetarian food. It's also refreshingly absent in the use of mock meat prevalent in more established restaurants. With the excellent ambiance, wide selection of food and inexpensive prices, it's now our go-to place for a quiet night out. The not-so-good: substandard service, much like what plagues the rest of Singapore

Located next to commonwealth crescent food market, it offers indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating is surprising cooling. This bistro offers delicious vegetarian food. I tried the Ginger Mee Sua Soup and felt loved its flavour. Friend ordered Basil Leaves Fried Vermicelli and said its worth the order. We also ordered Tofu with Pumpkin Dressing to share and felt that it is good to go with a plate of white rice. For drinks, we had Fruit Tea Pot which was served in a tall tea plunger.Definitely a place to revisit again
