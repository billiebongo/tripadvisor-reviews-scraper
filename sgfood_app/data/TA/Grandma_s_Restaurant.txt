The mutton curry has a great taste, very aromatic with loads of cloves and the chicken curry is good also if you like coconut. Didn't really fancy much else from looking around at other tables. The service is sort of casual.

Malaysia restaurant. Head Fish Nyonya is delicious (favorite). The other menu is not. Expensive price.
5
Ideal spot for a yummy local Singaporean style lunch - the lunch set with Katong Laksa was delicious. Local iced coffee was great too. Worth a visit!

If you want a good, quick meal in between the shopping then this restaurant offers quick service and good meals.I had the char kway teow and a lime juice for around S$17. Well cooked and tasty. Meal was light and easy on the stomach.This is more like a family restaurant and a healthy alternative to western fast food. Staff are attentive and efficient, prices are reasonable.

Yesterday, we went there for early dinner. We ordered the set meal for 2 pax - $35. We chose long bean with fish chilli garam (fix), long bean with belacan (other option was brocolli), and beef rendang (other option : honey chicken and I forgot the other), we drank cold barley and lime juice. The long bean with belacan and the beef rendang were tasty, the fish chilli garam was crispy and but slightly fishy and plain on taste. Their cold barley was good but not with the lime juice, it's very sour and got slightly chemical taste. But so far, it's a good experince for us as we're part of peranakan. The food brought our memory back to our hometown. The total cost was about $42 something after GST, service charge and other.

This restaurant is located inside Raffles City B1, can be reached by MRT to city hall. Heard a few good review from online blog, thus decided to give this restaurant a try. We went to eat lunch and they offered lunch set which include a main, a soup and a kueh. The ordering is through ipad that send orders to their kitchen, food serving is a bit slow though but might be due to many people. The soup and the kueh arrived before the main, kueh is good while soup is a bit normal. We have ordered laksa, olive fried rice and hokkien mee, both fried rice and hokkien mee taste too saltish while laksa over spicy. Overall do not feel the meal is all that good, not recommended
3
This is my "quick fix" place for a non-fast food solo meal whenever I'm in Singapore's Raffles City area. For about S$10/- slightly over £5/USD7 (before service tax), you can enjoy a delicious olive fried rice set meal. I'd rate it 3.5/5 and 4/5 on days I'm ravenous
4
Whenever I'm in Singapore, I always go to Grandma's for a quick meal--whether I'm alone or with family and/or friends. Branches conveniently located in shopping centers. (The last time, I visited the Raffles City branch.) I usually order the chicken satay (tender meat; delicious sauce), beef rendang, and sambal udang
1
We were shopping at the Raffles mall and was getting a bit hungry around afternoon tea time so we thought to try the afternoon tea menu at this place. I was the only one who was hungry so we've asked them if all of us can sit while I was the only one to eat - the staff was fine with it and confirmed that the size for the tea menu is generally on the small side as I didn't want to overeat to miss the dinner.The food (mee poh) was to my disappointment, pretty salty and average. The grass jelly drink was ok. When we sat down, we were given the prawn cracker which we didn't offer and didn't want as we just finished food from other place before we came here. Anyway, we were given the bill which didn't even have the set tea menu on it (only one for grass jelly and the other for the mee poh). So we thought the bill will be at SGD 6.90 as per the board. When we came to pay, they have asked us for SGD 10.10 so we naturally asked what's the difference in price as that was very different to what's advertised on the board. So they said, it was for service charges... so I've asked, what's the percentage of your service charge? (That amount nearly doubled the original price so I was wondering about the percentage given we were in Singapore and everything generally are what it says on the tin). After we have asked again, the staff said - oh, that was for the prawn cracker. So we said, we didn't order it and it didn't show up on the bill that you gave us and we didn't even wanted it nor consume it. So they tooked the cracker back and then it came to around SGD 8.10 or so. We didn't mind paying the right amount but it can't be done on the disguise basis. It's not an honest thing to do in this sort of business. Quite disgusted with the practice really especially in a country that's pride itself on its reputation of been fair in business

Grandma’s is a franchise located at several locations throughout Singapore that serves regular Asian and Nonya cuisine. One orders the food via an ipad attached to the table. We tried the Raffles City location and ordered the beef rending, Penang Char Kway Teow, Laksa, Nasi Lemak and a few other dishes. The food was reasonably good but servings were quite small and a little pricey. Service was fast and friendly
4
Late lunch. Had missed the set lunch period by 20 minutes. Anyway, the services were above average. And the quality of food was good. However, the price of the menu is high expensive as you can get something of same or better quality elsewhere.
4
We were tired and hungry so dropped in here with low expectations but boy were we glad we did! Really good "local" food at a reasonable price. Service wasn't the best, but we weren't bothered by that.
3
This outlet is at the basement of raffles city. Ordered chap chye, honey chicken and 2 gula melaka almond chin chow drinks. Chap cute cabbage is too hard. Honey chicken nothing special. The chin chow is special due to gula melaka.
3
Came here for a quick lunch. Ordered the Rendang Set Lunch. Nice selection and good price. Ordering via iPad at table is easy. Some of the dishes were really nice, others just so so. Not haute cuisine but good for lunch.
2
The food here was very average, nothing we ordered stood out. We tried the chicken satay, ngoh hiang, dumpling soup (way too salty), foo yong egg omelette, and poached spinach. I chewed on a rubber band while eating the spinach and spat it out. Told the manager straight away and to their credit they did not charge us for that dish. Whoever was cooking in the kitchen obviously wasn't hygienic or had poor eye sight. Won't be returning for sure.
3
If you're looking for a cheap and cheerful lunch this is a good place to go. You order via iPads We had three tables pushed together so we had three iPads. Being able to order and pay separately was great. Food came out at roughly the same time. They accommodate children's needs well.
3
Dinner started out good...ordered food via Ipad attached to the table.Chicken rendang curry..with naan. The dish was tasty but of course not healthy in any way as was to oily. Naan was good. Then dessert was gula melaka pancake which was advertised on the table holder but in the menu it was called coconut pancake but seemed to have 2 different names for the same menu item which is confusing to anyone not familar.Also the pancake was burnt and instead of redoing it..the burnt side was faced downwards to hide that it was burnt but it didn't matter as you would taste the burnt pancake when you bit into it. As seen in my attached photos
4
The two of us ordered one lunch dish and one drink each and we were happy with our choices. I would say the kampong chicken is better than the curry with rice. The drinks were too sweet especially the grass jelly drink so had to order another glass of ice to tone the sweetness down. The price was good. We left lunch with a full stomach. Chicken was big for the price of $12.90
3
My wife and I have travelled via Singapore for over 30 years and know the place and the restaurants quite well. This time we were caught in the Raffles City shopping complex on a day where the wife's shopping had been on the extreme side and were caught in a "to late for lunch, to early for dinner" kind of time. So it was tour the food court see what you fancy. Grandma's looked ok so we tried it. We both had nasi lemak it came within a couple of minutes and was good value for money. The ordering system is via a table based tablet that you make your selections on and they miraculously appear a short time late
4
This was our first taste of Kueh and to be honest it really isn't for us. We didn't sit in the restaurant, just bought our Kueh from the counter and took it home to eat. We had seen Kueh everywhere we went and wanted to try some ourselves - it was certainly very colourful and looked wonderful, but the texture just wasn't something we could eat a lot of. However we were glad we tried it and the service was good
3
The prices are quite high but the portions are small. The food was pretty good.
No service here! You have to order yourself in a tablet and there was practically no interaction with the staff until paying.
Disappointing compared with previous visits.
3
Their menu is quite the same as Madam Kwan's of Kuala Lumpur.
Food is good but not as good as Madam Kwan's.
Worth a try if you are around.
5
Wonderful restaurant! Food is so yummy, rice dishes are divine" They have a fantastic selection of food & drinks is good value for money! One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore.
3
My daughter & I visited the restaurant at Suntec City for lunch. We ordered the Ayam Buah Keluak, Olive Fried Rice & Chendol. The first two items were quite decent, the Chendol (which they claim to be their signature dish) was insipid, for want of a better word. In their dessert list there are 4-5 items with durian and only one original Chendol. Unfortunately none of the durian items were available so we had to order the only remaining item - regular Chendol. I find it very surprising that the majority of dessert menu is not available. And no idea why they stopped serving their excellent ice kachang. I used to go to their Paragon branch just for that. Wish they will seriously look into their desserts and get them back on track.
4
we had dinner at Grandma's in Raffles City before our meetings. the idea was to have a quick meal. 6pm so tables were easy to get, ordered thru the Ipad and within minutes the order was confirmed and drinks served. food was fresh, tasty and large serving with the result we had to take some back with us. excellent service, very good value and will go back again. take out is also available
3
This popular restaurant is usually full during dinner. Each time we stay at the Fairmont Hotel, we will eat here at least once.Service is hospitable and quick. Once you have sat down, they will provide a portion of crackers - it was on the soft side this time around, but went well with the sambal chilli.I had the nasi Bukhari, and enjoyed the mutton satay, which had a strong taste of lemongrass. The fried chicken was also very good, crispy on the outside and still tender and moist inside and full of flavour. The omelette slice was ordinary but I was disappointed with the rice, which was tasteless - in fact, I had to ladle on a lot of sambal.The plate of deep fried prawn dumplings was delicious and crispy, though for around $11 before taxes, you would expect more than 6 pieces. We also ordered a plate of Cantonese noodles, which was tasty as well. We ended the meal with two glasses of grass jelly. While refreshing, they were on the sweet side. A meal for two cost around $50
5
~a tasty lunch with tastes of Malaysia, not unlike Madam Kwan's but markedly more Singapore flavored~fresh coconut to start everyone off, Nasi Bukhari was my choice and it was a smashing success, makes my mouth water just remembering it~Nasi Lemak, Chinchalok Omelette (WOW), Beef Rendang all favorites :)the one thing I remember well was that durian ice cream serving that I had for dessert... a great dish to die for 
4
We visited Grandma's at Raffles City with some friends (5 adults, 2 children). Service was decent. We tried 6 dishes, each was very tasty. The serves are not large, which makes it easier to try a variety of flavors. The mutton curry was definitely a standout in terms of flavor. We ordered cendol for dessert - fantastic cendol! Overall a nice lunch
4
The food here is decent, better than many places serving the same thing. For example, I've always thought they have a good char kway teow, and their honey chicken with marmite is actually very good. Their noodle soups are average, and so is the chicken rice. Service is perfunctory; ticks all the boxes but never really warm and in fact always hasty.
3
We wanted to try some local Singaporean food, so this restaurant looked interesting. It is located in the basement of the Raffles City Mall and very convenient for those staying at the Fairmont or Swissotel. We tried the Nasi Lemak and it was good. Not sure if it was the best, but the food was ok. Thereâ€™s a sign board outside the eatery with pictures of what they service and they have special offerings. Service was ok
4
You find great restaurants in strange places in Sungapore & this is one of them. The food, of which we had plenty was great. The flavours & quantity of food were great, the price, inexpensive. Well worth a look.
1
Food: Nonya
Taste: horrible - not authentic at all - not even close.
Presentation: good
Service: Very good (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)
Hygiene: 3 of my family members had diarrhea several in the midnight
4
Situated in the lower level of raffles city mall this restaurant serves authentic Asian cuisine and staff is young and very considerate.
The host is really nice and you feel feel welcomed with yummy food!
Do try fresh sweet coconut water..
4
Couldn't believe how good the chicken curry was. My 15 year old son went back for more another day. Had to pay for water not so impressed by that considering drinks are so expensive in singapore. water should be free.
3
It is getting more expensive to dine out in Singapore especially in city malls like Raffles City. Good to know that Grandma's continue to serve good local fare that does not cost an arm and a leg.Food is peranakan in essence and flavour with many nonya favourites available.Enjoyed the ayam buah keluak which goes well with the rice. Meat is tender and juicy too.Chap chye or mixed vegetables is my personal favourite - simple yet tasty.The fish head curry is a delight, the way most would like it. Not too spicy, just about right.The otah is also highly recommended.For dessert, the chendol is a shoo in. On weekends, the place can be pretty crowded.The service here is warm and prompt
4
We were craving for a restaurant with authentic Singaporean flare and we bumped into Grandma's. We ordered their Nasi Bukhari which was on the too spicy for me. The Nasi Lemak was cooked in a different way- with red curry sauce, but was equally good! Service was good and the restaurant was pretty crowded during the lunch hour.
4
Great, no-nonsense home-style food in the heart of the city. Grandma's offers an unusual selection (Chinese, Malay, Indonesian) of food with a friendly wait staff and good service. The char kway teow is superb as is the chendol. Also try the nasi lemak and nasi bukhari
4
Nice place for traditional Singaporean meals, standard pricing, services OK but not large but good taste. Not a big place but there is reasonable seating area and always seemed busy when we went past so decided to try. Had the beef rendang and it was good.Maybe a bit difficult for families for food options otherwise worth a try
4
If you are new to Singapore, Grandma's is a great place to begin sampling local food. All the Singapore/Malaysian staples are here, including Nasi Lemak, Char Kway Teow, Laksa, Beef Rendang, chicken curry... The quality is good, even if a little more expensive than going to a food court (where the quality is often variable anyway)
3
They serve a delicious plate of nasi lemak, with curry chicken, half of a hard-boiled egg, onion relish, pickles and cucumber. Other notable dishes include the beef rendang, lady's fingers fried in sambal chilli, and fried noodles. But the portions are small, especially if you consider that a plate of beef rendang costs around S$10
4
Excellent range of food. Can be crowded, but they always manage to find a a table quickly.
The Char Kwai Teow is always good
4
We enjoyed the Olive fried rice and Curry Laksa.
The service was good...may be not the quickest to serve. The server was helpful and took care of us though.
4
Ok meal and reasonable value but service very mixed from some fairly disenchanted members of staff!!
2
Marketed itself as a Singapore restaurant but nothing Singaporean about the food. Half hearted service by foreign service staff. Food is bland, lack soul and unsatisfactory. Will never visit again. $25 for 2
5
during my stay in the swissotel i always go a few times to this restaurant. it is a simple restaurant in the food court. you can have a delicious dinner, quick and cheap.
3
Visited Grandma's @ Changi City Point and faced the weekday lunch crowd. Service was alright thou nothing fantastic. We had a couple of dishes (otah & salted egg prawn) which were average, the Fried Rice was good and paid for the most expensive Nasi Lemak.. The best was served at the end, Sago Gula Melaka.
4
The seafood "Hor Fun" - big flat noodles, caught my attention (the customer was just clearing his plate and the colour looked really nice) while I was shopping at Raffles City and the next thing I did was asked for a table for two to try this dish. My partner and I ordered one "Hor Fun" and shared among the two of us. We are both very picky when it comes to local food and also having taste buds that is hard to please. This dish was delicious and I give it a thumb up as my recommendation. The next item that caught my eyes was the "Cendol" - a sweet dessert with brown sugar, red beans and jackfruit. The reason I wrote this review is to comment on the great service the branch manager gave during my visit. He was polite, fast and he is very attentive too. Whenever I raised my hand for service, he immediately spots it and come over. He is also very polite as well (besides having a stern look) and I took the opportunity to express my gratitude too when I paid the bill. This is the kind of service at a restaurant, cafe or eatery that makes the difference and not some "all-snobbish-don't-care-attitude" which most cafes in Singapore adopt and just let you wait in line for a table or ignore eye-contact when you call for bill or service or additional order etc. I will definitely visit Grandma's again at this branch to enjoy this great service from the branch manager. *Note: The service from the waitresses need improvement as they do not smile and they look like they are having a bad da
4
Visited Grandmas last week after work. This is the second outlet I have visited having gone to the outlet in Changi Point last month. On both occasions I have found the food simple but good and very reasonably priced for the location. Service is ok but not great and very abrupt. However, Simon the assistant Manager was very helpful to us despite the Friday evening rush. Great for an after work meal with consistent food, portions and reasonable pricing. We will go again.
2
I learnt about this restaurant from an online deal, and decided to give it a try, since the restaurant served several of my favourite local and Asian dishes. I left the restaurant feeling disappointed, and decided to never place my money there, again. It was suppose to be a restaurant visit but the set up was like a cafe, or even worse, a canteen. After showing us our seats, the waitress hurriedly placed the menus in front of us, and asked us what we would like to have. We could tell that the place was run by too few staff with too much to do. After we made our orders, it was followed by a long wait before we were served our foodWe ordered the house special Nasi Bhukuri, which is a rice dish with fried chicken and beef rendang, a fried noodle dish and stir fried chilli and mixed vegetable. Each dish was a disappontment in terms of taste and presentation. And for the prices we were paying for the dishes, we could easliy have gotten much better tastes, at a fraction of the prices, in the food court just next door. There was nothing commendable about the service from the restaurant as well. The busy staff gave the impression that they did not wish to be bothered, and 1 of our dishes, out of 3 was forgotten in the kitchen. it is certainly a place I will not be making a repeat visit. What a disappointment
1
Had the most disappointing meal experience at Grandma's Changi City Point. Made a reservation, but was told that still need to queue. Seriously, why make people to reserve and then queue up with the rest of the people who does not have any reservations?Ordered the $34.90 Assam fish Head and top up another $4 for additional vegetables, but was stunned when it arrived. The portion was so small! It was meant to be shared, but I think I can easily finish the whole portion by myself. Out of the 4 adults sharing that dish, I only had a small portion of fish (less than 3 fingers combine). And to add to the insult, the ADDITIONAL vegetables was so little it can be counted by 2 hands. Crazy prices and I was not impressed by the taste at all. I had better and cheaper elsewhere.The rest of the dishes were small in portions as well. Think they are meant for 2 to share at max. The spinach tofu was nothing spectacular. And seriously $11 for a plate of normal Nasi Lemak is daylight robbery.I spent around $110, and left still feeling hungry. It's not that I am not willing to order more, just that what's the point of ordering if all the portions are so pathetic? If I ordered similar food at Zi Char stores, the bill would probably be less than $60.It is not as if the service or the ambiance is good. Noisy place with very little customer service as they are probably under-staffed.Overall, average food quality, absent customer service, lousy(& illogical) reservation system, extremely small portions and exceptionally high prices make me ban this place. My first visit would definitely by my last. You have been warned. Avoid, avoid, avoid...My bet is if they don't improve on their service and value for money, I would not be surprised to see this establishment close down soon. Such a letdown
4
The food was local Singapore dishes and were very tasty with reasonably priced drinks.
We received quick service and enjoyed our visit.
3
Grandma's is famed for it's local-style Singapore home-cooking. We liked the food in the family café atmosphere.
4
The cafe was recommended by the Fairmont concierge. It is Malaysian food, very good and very casual. Wonderful Beef rendang and specials. We would definitely turn.
5
Ate a lunch and dinner at Grandma;s. Found it in the basement of Raffles City. Really enjoyed all the dishes we ordered. Friendly staff and very quick with orders. Good food!!
5
I visited Grandma's on a few occasions recently whilst in Singapore. The Chicken Curry is one of the nicest I've had. Great restaurant with a very good choice of food and deserts. Very laid back atmosphere with good friendly service.
4
Great place for Chicken Rice, Cendol, Sago Gula Melaka. Located in the basement of Paragon shopping mall on Orchard. Good food with reasonable pricing.
2
Went there with a group of 10 colleagues for lunch, the restaurant was about half filled. You'd have to be quite patience if you want to eat in this restaurant, from getting someone to take your order, setting the table, till the food is served. You'll see waitresses running around & some occasional yelling but the supervisor, which seems like they are really busy. Then you'll realized that there it's been an hour since you order and your food is no where to be seen, and everyone you asked will tell you "it's on the way"....right...probably from the other side of the island! Then when the food comes, we got wrong orders or missed orders...so...wait some more...If you want a refill of your water, help yourself with the flasks from the counter, don't bother to ask, you'll get the same answer "sure, it's on the way"!Let's move on, food wise - couple of my friends and I had the chicken rice, which taste like any other food court, the rice is a little cold though, not sure if it's been left at the kitchen for too long or it's just pull out from the fridge. According to the other friends who have other dishes (Nasi Lemak, Beef Rendang, etc), their's were quite well done. Don't think I'll go back again
3
The Good =)~Nice restaurant featuring local delights.The Bad =(~Expensive for a plate of NASI LEMAK.~Some may not be able to sample because most dishes contain chilli.My Tip for future visits:~Don't order the NASI LEMAK despite it being its signature dish because there are better choices
4
This restaurant is located under the Raffle's mall - we were hot and tired so it was a good place to stop. The chicken rice and Ngoh Hiang were delicious. We found the service fast and friendly and the prices OK. One small thing - they give you prawn crackers at the beginning and you think "that's nice" but then there is a charge on the bill
5
This place is buried under the Fairmont Hotal in the Marketplace shopping mall and vies with many other food hall typoe eateries. We went there on spec and were plesantly surprised at the taste and quality of the food. Not fine dining but very acceptable and reasonably priced by Singapore standards
1
Beef rendang and chicken wings were really good but service was so bad. Staffs were just sitting around and not taking orders. Disappointing.
5
If you find for halal food, this is one of the few restaurant in Singapore that serve it. It is a Malay food and the taste is beyond my expectation and also the price is reasonable. I would recomend this restaurant.
4
I am eat on this restaurant with other 6 friends. They like the menu and also halal food. The price is fair and reasonable.
5
Amazing food.. try the Chicken here they make it like in western India and the Assam Fish Head ... Wow
3
The restaurant is just one of many, many restaurants located at the lower floor at Raffle's City Mall. We had the Curry Laksa and Honey Chicken as well as some other dishes and all were very good. However, it is is very busy and really noisy with so many adjacent restaurants. I've been to some canteens as well as food courts where the ambience is much better.With so many restaurants in Singapore, I'd go somewhere else
1
1st experience there and tried their signature Assam fish head. The Cray pot was impressive, big size but once open up, it is only half filled and you can hardly see the fish. The taste of the Assam is disappointing! I am not interested to try their other dishes if they cant even do Assam well
3
Each time we stay at the Fairmont Hotel, we end up eating here as the food is tasty, especially the char kway teow. This time, we tried a new rice dish, costing $14.90 before taxes. The broken fried rice was nice and you get a huge, crispy chicken thigh, which unfortunately was a little dry. The accompanying beef rendang was too small though, and there was also just two itsy-bitsy prawns in onion sambal, besides half a hard boiled egg. Quite a disappointment. Service was okay, though we had to wave to a few waiters at the start just to order
2
This restaurant is right under the raffles city mall, and also underneath the Swissotel and Fairmont hotels. They had a different selection of Singaporean items and I had tried beef rendang at another restaurant so tried it here as well but found there version to be pretty bad. I had it for lunch and heartburn till late that night. Not sure if it was just that day but I wouldn't care to try the place again to find out.Alsol their service wasn't that nice either. Overall just an ordinary place so not missing much if you don't try this place. Better to try out some other restaurants
3
This is a great place for a sampling of local peranakan food in Raffles City Mall. Do visit if you are staying at the Fairmont Hotel or Swissotel on Stamford and you have no clue on where to go or what to eat. For people with a car and options, I would hesitate to recommend this place. Overall, it is a nice cozy restaurant and the food is authentic enough. However, the portions are mortifyingly small (I am a person who enjoys food and appreciates generous portions). There were 6 of us at dinner, and we had to order two portions of the same dishes just so that there was enough to go around. The prices are reasonable but when you have to order duplicate dishes - the bill can be quite exorbitant
4
Food quality is subjective, so it is truly difficult to pin-point if a restaurant serves truly excellent cuisine, unless it has its Michelin stars as proof.Hence, I am writing this review, not to downplay the negative reviews I see written about this restaurant chain, but more so, I feel; to highlight its strengths.We were shown to our table quickly, despite being a Sunday evening. Thankfully, the crowd had yet to close in on the restaurant, though they did shortly after we started our dinner.We were asked to 'Like' their FaceBook page, the incentive for doing so was a complimentary hot tea or iced lemon tea. We obliged and the service staff was even kind enough to navigate us to their Home page.The ala carte menu listed home-cooked comfort dishes, something Grandma, no pun intended; would cook. We ordered the honey chicken, tahu telor and tou miao accompanied with steamed rice. The portions were large enough for two and their prices reasonable. For those of us who cannot take the spices, the tahu telor was hot. Scrape the sauce off the tahu telor and savour the soft tahu instead. I loved the tou miao, cooked right with just a tinge of garlic. The restaurant could do with somepaintings or artifacts on the wall. It was a trifle bit simplistic decor-wise. The service staff was not intrusive, yet attentive at the right time. The desserts were not to my liking, so I decided to skip them; something I do not usually do. Anyway, it turns out the services rendered to this diner was 'Satisfaction Guaranteed' enough
1
I absolutely love Asian food but really didn't enjoy the food in this restaurant. Don't ask me why but I just didn't get it
5
We went to Grandma's twice during our stay as the wonton soup and more traditional fish head curry ( if you have the stomach for it ) were great value for money and delicious. Service was very quick and they serve reasonably cheap beer, what more could you want !
5
I and my pal ordered:1. belachan kangkong (S$8.90)2. mini Ngoh Hiang (10 one-inch pieces for S$6.90)3. Nasi Bukhari (fragrant rice with fried chicken drumstick, sauteed prawns, and beef rendang for S$14.90)4. teh tarik ("pulled" tea for S$1.80)The tidbits or crackers were yummy too (charged at S$1.60). The service was prompt: I asked for a knife and the waitress presented me with one within a minute. This is my second visit here but my friend's visit. She was pleasantly surprised by such delicious food being served here at the basement of Raffles City. I was pleased with my recommendation! Overall, the meal was sumptuous, served in good portions, and economical. I would highly recommend GR amongst other restaurants here at this mall.
3
Grandma's at the Raffles City shopping centre is firmly in the class of good, honest but not amazing Baba Nonya food. This is not surprising, as it's in a food court, but if you're just in the market for a feed and not looking for the most amazing culinary experience inSingapore, then it's perfectly fine.Try the Ngoh Hiang- chicken in fried bean curd wrappers; quite a tasty appetizer or side
1
The Grandma's restaurant was one of the worst restaurants i all of Singapore. First off, the chicken curry did not have the authentic coconut milk 'smell' to it like those at the Hawker centers, and the prices are cut throat. the rice was bland and the portions small. The people who write good reviews about these kinds of restaurants are most likely paid to write them, or terrible at differentiation between good food and bad food. One word of friendly advice, do not believe all of those articles about food or the food recommendations on TV, most are sponsored and the food that you eat there is usually a far cry from what they claim it to be
4
Good outlet for food - Nasi Lemak is rich for their coconut rice and the sides is plentiful. Do not forget their chilli belachan that goes well with their food. Besides the nonya menu, there are other dishes available too. Ideal for families, friends and get-together.This restaurant has shifted to NEX with easy access by MRT and the bus interchange is located at the building. It is ideal because this restaurant is open always with choices of offers for all
3
We ate dinner at Grandma's Kitchen on a weeknight as it was filling up. We didn't see any other diners that we felt were tourists. We feel many of Grandma's Kitchen's deficiencies are due to inexperienced but well-meaning staff and/or lax supervisors. Of course, taste has something to do with it. We liked the fried tofu better than the Grandma's special sauce that covered it. But we really enjoyed the honey chicken. The rice was also good. They only charged us for one portion of steamed rice even though we ate two. We ordered baby kailan with oyster sauce, and they brought baby kailan with lots of chopped garlic. We sent it back, and we are almost certain they brought back the original baby kailan with chopped garlic with oyster sauce poured over it. The bill was about S$40 including service charge, and it took a while to get the bill and even longer to get the change. We feel the food is tasty if you know what to order and what not to order

Ate here w/ a few colleagues. One keeps going back to this place he likes it so much. So will I. Excellent food. Service was so-so - took a while to get my check. Otherwise it was a really enjoyable, tasty meal. And priced very well, not expensive at all.I'll be back

I had lately patronised the branch outlet of the same restaurant. It was located at Nex Shopping Centre, right above Serangoon MRT station. The food listed are suggestive that it's peranakan cuisine. And when one heard of peranakan cuisine, it means tasty, very flavourful / spicy food which should be similar to what Melaka is offering.We ordered the Assam fish head, mixed vegetables and the ngoh hiang. The assam fish head itself is a big dissappointment. It wasn't fresh! And the assam sauce? It's just the tangy sour taste, nothing more than that. Not even the least spicy note can be found in it. As for the ngoh hiang, the chestnuts bits in it were too big. The meat was alittle dry and you could taste too much of the "star anise" fragrant in it that it becomes too overpowering. Ohh and the crackers they served when you arrive, it's not crispy at all. Thumbs down for this place and the food quality

The food wasn't that bad. Laksa didn't impressed me at all. I had mackerel asam fish, not bad, beef rendang was ok but it could be better, kang kong belachan taste accepted but to not everyone, potato leaves was good. Seafood kway teow pretty good. Pricing a bit high for the size you get. Very small portions is serve, if you are a big eater order more or double potions on each serving. Atmosphere was alright. Can be very noisy during lunch time
