This is probably the best Tosai and the gravy I ever had in little India.
Highly recommended for Indian food lovers. It is at the junction of Syed Alwi Road and Verdun road. Just opposite Mustapha Center. Enjoy!

We had chicken biriyani and mutton biriyani. It was delicious mouthwatering meal. Seveice was average. Low budget meals compared to other places in Singapore. Situated in a very convenient place.

Waiters are slow and selective..they are not that busy at 3pm I supposed. However, I should try their nasi padang next time. I tried egg roti and an iced tea (less sweet), both were decent and price quite cheap for $3.10

I just had lunch with my colleague at this restaurant/kopishop called C.M.K 2001 near Mustafa centre. I bought a set of chappati and teh tarik. They are charging me $6 just for a set of chappati. Don’t you think is over price? The last time I had Mee kuah there, they charged me $8. My other colleagues who went there and eat also mention the same thing, that’s all their food is over price compare to other shops around that area. The price should be reasonable for a kopishop

We came here for breakfast. I ordered Chicken Briyani and that was soo delicious. My wife ask me to try Prata flat with Curry..I think the Prata were great..Teh Tarik is ok too. This place located in front of Mustafa Center. Nice place to try when you want to taste popular Indian Cuisine..It is a low budget restaurant too.

Don't waste your time, money and energy to eat here. U will only be greeted by angry server and poor customer service. Food served cold, late and worst still they forget all about your order!!! Unable to accept feedback. Rude to customer. Server and cook RAISE their voice to customer when approached for queries. Poor hygiene handling food, slippery floor, dirty messy cooking area, flies seen at food counter serving area and uncovered condiments served on the table. Worst ever restaurant!!! You pay for your meal and you deserved a proper one and as for this, they treat you as if you are begging for food !!! WTH!! There's a few nearby restaurants to eat that worth your every cents. Skip this restaurant unless you don't mind being served by angry server with poor quality food. One word TERRIBLE !!

Several times we went to this restaurant to learn that some of the menus are available only at certain period. Like prata will be available in the morning or night but not in the afternoon. Naan or Butter chicken is served after 4:00 PM. My favorites are all kind of prata here. Some of the waiters are passively offer any dishes even after you order something they didn't give you any acknowledgment . Some are actively offer the choices. The prices are acceptable for budget travelers

We went to the restaurant at lunch time , so we were able to order only lunch time menus(what menu can be served is determined by time ranges, morning, lunch, evening and night). If you want to try Indian curry with nan, you should go in evening time.At lunch time, we ordered "Mutton Biryani" that is Indian fried rice with mutton curry(chicken, shrimp, etc, you can chose). That was really awesome!! It cost only 8SGD. Also, you can chose soft drinks at 1 to 1.2SGD.They have No air conditioner, dishes are hot and spicy, so you must bring some cold water with you while eating.Not paying at the table but at the counter where a restaurant guy is sitting.No toilet I think, but the restaurant is located close to Mustafa Shopping Center, you can use one in it.Almost all the customers were local, but staffs tell you haw to order and which menus are available at the time when you visit. Ask them, but do not expect regular restaurant service

This place is located in front of Mustafa Centre, entrance 4. We came here for a quick dinner. I ordered fried noodles and my sister ordered fried maggi but it is burnt both taste and smell. My other friends ordered earlier than us and the order came earlier (same food, fried noodles and fried maggi) but the taste is nice and not burnt. So my sister and I did not want to make any fuss, so we just ordered prata cheese instead. Much later, one of the waiter came to clear our table and ask why we didn't finish the food. So we told him that it is burnt but the waiter is offended and says 'cannot be' and keep telling us that no one ever complain about the food there. It seems that he is implying that we were lying. I told him if you don't trust us you try it for yourself. If you don't want to accept what we say, why do you even ask? We didn't even make a fuss by asking them to change the food earlier and we just ordered a different food and pay

I was visiting the Mustafa Shopping Complex (across the road) and noticed that this place was well patronised. Several days later I returned and decided to have lunch here as it was still well patronised (always a good sign). The food was tasty but the service was slack. There were a number of dishes advertised that weren't available at the time I was dining... that was annoying. I found this venue to be good value for money despite the limited menu at the time

Sunday morning shop at Mustafa for all the stuff followed by breakfast at C.M.K......can there be a more Singaporean Sunday morning?
Love the food....$23 for 4.
Great experience for westerners.

Great place for an honest Indian breakfast... We love coming here after our monthly Mustafa shop. Breakfast for two at under $15.

Ordered roasted chicken rice at this cmk outlet.. being served by the staff who is so impatient and no sense of smile... the rice was bad and it's was cold and slimy...this gonna be the last time we going to eat here.

i usually go here when i have cravings and the food is good. decent quantity for the cost and friendly staff.
1
I go there very often as I stay very close to Mustafa and this place., the standard order for me is "double egg onion Prata" with veg curry. For last 2 times this particular staff (see pic) is telling me that they don't serve veg curry even if you pay extra.. Except for this guy everyone else is ready to serve the veg curry. He is extremely rude and mannerless and I will avoid this place in the future just because of this guy. There is another option next door for the Prata and dosas, Ma Raj, and I will try that out instead.

i have tried lots of food here, all food ok, the thosai is the best, masala thosai was great here, the teh tarik is also good.... sometimes especially weekends too crowded here which is just across mustaffa center. very reasonable price. from farrer mrt 10 mins walk. plenty of taxis here
3
Came solo. Has mutton mysore, and pigeon egg karma and plain rice and a can of drink. Bill came up to $9.40. Find that quite expensive for food that is not hot and probably cooked late noon. But the restaurant is quite crowded all the time. Prata is good if it is freshly made.

Quite good and cheap local Indian food but the ambiance is super-super rustic!!The dish (I forget the name) of the mixed chopped ingredients with toothpicks actually was pretty decent and so were the cold drinks ... provided a good rest.The bathrooms are EXTREMELY rustic, beware

So this place isn't packed on a Sunday evening. Waited for a long time and the person choose not to serve me. Fine. I went to the counter order and they told me to take a seat and someone would serve. Okay. I went back and continued waiting for another good 10mins. Usually I don't give bad reviews but sorry, this is really beyond poor. I am very sure that everytime when I come back here, service standard would fall. Seriously, do yourselves a favour, just visit the restaurant directly opposite this place. It is much cheaper about a dollar or 2, so why not

Prices here is very expansive and the food is bland or tasteless. The place is not even air-conditioned for the price being paid. The prices had been going up and the taste have been going down. Toilet is hidden at the back and its very dirty and smelly. Avoid using the Toilets. Mutton Briyani here cost S$8 whereas at the main road(heading towards city) there is an indian shop that sells better tasting Mutton Briyani for only S$5. The hot drinks are not even very hot; it is always made in advance(I don't know for how long) and placed on the counter and the staff will take from there. Even the Mango Lassi used to be very thick and delicious but sadly now, it is made in advance and placed in the fridge. The taste and quantity have also been reduced drastically but the price had gone up

I would go for their Thosai each time I'm back here, the sauces are excellent. The taste seem to be less good on some days, but generally nice. :)

the place has a different way in servicing customers. the waiters may seems less care at first, but they served you well. meals are ready within minutes, prices are affordable, but be ready to find a busy ambiences

Went here for breakfast 3 mornings out of 4 in our most recent trip. It was 4 stops away on the MRT. The service at this 24 hour gem is brusque and efficient, but I can safely say that this place is hands down the No 1 indian fare I have tasted. Dosai, Masala, Prata, Biryani are all top quality, and are all served at a very good price in the often expensive Singapore. Don't expect Fine Cuisine at this price, but you will not be disappointed. Tummy happiness abounds

Drop by here first before attempting to seek loot in Mustafa's 4 shopping malls. This 24 hour halal "kopi" shop has an excellent range of food from the lighter thosi and naan to Nasi Padang meals to the fancier bone soups. The to-die-for large Mutton Briyani is about SG$8 of delicious goodness, perfect for carnivores. Waiters take your order and bring the food quickly. Thirsty? There's the usual range of drinks - rose bandung, lassi, teh tarik, local coffees, fruit juices and shakes, lime juice for cooling overheated shoppers. The place appears to be perpetually busy but a space will usually clear up and table spaces are free to share, sometimes even make new friends.This is a great place for your fortifying pre-shopping spree meal. Come back hours later for your post-shopping snack/ breakfast hangout before flying out of this city

i came across this place, just while wandering in the lanes around Mustafa. Tasty food served in clean environment, saw a lot of locals having food here, so must be popular. Egg parotha (3 nos.), fry chicken, and a glass of Ice water cost some 10.5 SD. Ordinary veg food may cost 4-6 SD

I go to this place everytime I visit the area for a very simple reason......my daughter is not willing to go anywhere else. The very mention of the spinach lentil they serve here makes her eat double of what she normally eats.A very small place, non aircon (they do have an aircon area but I dont bother), always full with reasonable price, prompt service and extremely fresh and delicious South Indian food. They do have a local cuisine fare but I have not tried thatGenerally, I take their spinach dhall (compulsory), a fish fry and a chicken. This comes with a complimentary finger licking fish curry. I have tried their dosa (thosai) which is equally good. Have not been tempted by the biryani though as it doesn't look very appealing and is pricey. Amongst the patrons, one can find all sorts of persons.....one who can't afford pricey restaurant and the rest who care only about good food. So, if you are of the kind who are not too hung up on ambience and value the food quality more than anything else, this place is a must

While this restaurant is not frequented by many tourists, it should be. The range of authentic dishes and taste from the fresh food prepared in this establishment is simply impressive. Eat by hand, leave cutlery alone. CMK is also open 24 hours a day and they serve any south indian dich around the clock. The flavours are deep and the taste like no other. This place looks pretty ordinary. It looks like you'll have a bad tummy for a good month...but nothing untoward has resulted from my visits. It's very clean. I've had this food packed and eaten it on the plane [in business and eco class!]. For anyone who has traveled to India, you'll appreciate the style of take away packaging.This place provides a good break between Mustafas

Pros...great food quality, would stack up against any Indian food I have ever tasted. All tasty with good portion size and ample condiments and accompaniments, very quick service. Visited 4 times in 4 days and it really is a foodies gem. Its not 5 star...the waiters are brusque and efficient, its semi outdoor, but undercover and its 24 hour so they turn over some business and it looks this way. The price however is in the cheap range. Never spent more than SGD 20 for 2 people with a drink, and always came away feeling very satisfied. If anyone complains about this place then they probably need to go somewhere more upmarket and pricey, but beware, you will probably not get the same quality of food

This is an authentic Indian restaurant catering predominantly to Indians. I've read in some of the reviews here that some people have had bad experiences with the service, don't let it put you off. The guys working here don't mean to be rude. They have limited English and so find it hard to communicate much past taking your order. Be patient and you will be rewarded with delicious food at very cheap prices. The decor is plastic chairs and the place is open air. If you require mood music and oil paintings on the wall then this is not the place for you. My standard order is a dish of mutton mysore (dried goat curry), a bowl of mutton masala (wet goat curry), rice and a banana milkshake, enough for two people and all for the grand price of $15. The food here is so good that on my regular trips through Singapore I will take a short stopover just so I can catch a taxi to CMK restaurant to stock up on goat curry and curried eggs for my return home. If you love Indian food take a chance, you won't be disappointed

I love their thosai. Place is always full and if you're picky, you might think twice before eating here. It's open, not air conditioned. But the experience is worth coming back. The crew though are not so attentive of your orders so you always have to follow up. The food is good and price is affordable
