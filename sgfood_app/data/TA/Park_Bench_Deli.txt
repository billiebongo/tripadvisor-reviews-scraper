The place is not out of ordinary. It is simple and easy. to go about. The broccoli falafel sandwich is really nice, They do home deliveries as well via deliveroo/ ubereats.
5
The breakfast sandwich with running eggs was so delicious and just right portion. Atmosphere is chilled and unassuming. Will go back and try other sandwiches
4
Not the best place for kids, but i certainly like the appeal of the place, portions are small but filling - mini hash browns are great, will be back probably with coworkers instead

I work nearby and am constantly looking for new and exciting lunch spots. Since first trying Park Bench Deli it had become a firm favourite, the food here is always outstanding! The only downside for me is that as a vegetarian there aren’t more options I can have. I have tried the broccoli falafel which is amazing and also the PB+J sandwich - an absolute MUST for any peanut butter fans. Consists of thick crunchy peanut butter and mixed fruit jam, toasted between slices of milk and chocolate swirled bread that has been encrusted on the outside with cornflakes. Has to be tried to be believed. It is absolutely stunningly delicious. I believe this place is much better than some of the better known lunch spots in the area. It should have a much better reputation than other options in the area which I don’t think are worth the hype

I first visited PBD a few months after they opened. Their grilled cheese sandwich was beautiful - oozing, melty cheese with a lovely, flavorful roasted tomato soup. Fast forward a year plus later - their grilled cheese sandwich was barely melted as I could still see the cheese shreds and NO PULL whatsoever, and oil was swimming in the soup. Definitely not recommended.

Been a while since I've been here. Sandwiches are still nicely toasted (fried?), still filling and still greasily good. Always enjoy the different textures and flavours when you bite into their sandwiches. Downside is that they're overpriced for what they serve. Because of both its price and fat content, probably best to visit occasionally, not regularly.

Came across this wonderful shop by accident and will definitely return. We had the sous vide fried chicken sandwich and the falafel broccoli sandwich. Paired with a root beer. Tasty, fresh and oh so good. S$38 for two persons. Still full, 4 hours later! Will return for their breakfast items at a later date.

I originally came to Park Bench Deli with the anticipation to order the Fried Chicken Sandwich. However, when I got there, I was told it was sold out. Helpfully the girl working behind the counter suggested the Turkey sandwich, and I am quite glad she did as it was the best turkey sandwich I have eaten in my life! Absolutely loved it!! Well done Park Bench

So, I paid SGD17 for a cubano sandwich. Yes, by US standards that would be near ridiculous, but we are in Singapore and it's one of the few sandwich spots in the area. Basically, I'd rather have the choice to occasionally pay up rather than not. The kitchen looks state-of-the-art, the sandwich was tasty. If smalls cheaper I'd probably go more, so my arteries are thankful.

Great sandwich spot in CBD in Singapore on the corner of Amoy and Telok Ayer Streets. I had the cheesesteak sandwich. It was the best I have had in a very long time. The melted cheese with sliced pieces of steak in a I delicious heated bun. Outstanding! Another person had grilled cheese with a small side of tomato soup for dipping and a third had a cheese melted burger. All were hot, tasty and delicious. The staff was polite, informative and accommodating. Must stop and experience good food

Had the Cubano and the Falafel, both are great! The portions are a bit big, and they are generous with the dressing, so the sandwich does not dry out.
Highly recommend for a quick lunch or dinner.
5
Place has a good vibe to it. The PB & J sandwich is my favorite. Owner looks like Negan from the walking dead, giving it an extra wow factor. Perfect place for grab and go or to chill!
5
I don't usually eat bread / sandwiches for dinner but this was so worth it!! I could it this anytime of the day. A definitely must try, especially the one with the fried chicken! The chicken was so good! Worth more than a visit!
4
Good sandwiches and good service staff. Try out the Cubano and Grilled Cheese Sandwich. Worth the trip and time.
5
From the butter bread to the juicy meats to the tasty sauce. It was just perfection in your mouth. Not the most glamorous meal because it does get a bit messy but totally worth it.

We found out about PBD at the Singapore Coffee Festival. I can't believe I didn't know of this place earlier.....their sandwiches are really awesome!!!Because the scotch egg sandwich and the cheese burger we tried at the SCF was so addictive, we had to go back for more the next week. The sandwiches here are down-to-earth, deli-style, messy and serious grub. Expect to go home with a full stomach and sticky fingers. Apart from the food, we love the ambience with good music and cool wall art, the cute sandwich wrappers and the staff t-shirts!!The guys here are super friendly and serious about their sandwiches. And you can tell they all have fun doing what they do, it shows in their attitude. Even when the queue was so long at their SCF booth, all of them were smiling and having a good time. No one was complaining or frustrated with the long wait time (and it was definitely worth the long wait) because the staff were obviously doing their best, and they did manage the queue well. So, thumbs up to the wonderful food and the great staff!!I'm going back for more soon.

This is like Subway on steroids. Good breads, great mix of fillings and very generous. Plus the crew members are friendly and look like they're having fun at work.I especially loved the chicken katsu sandwich. Had some expectations for the PB&J sandwich, but it disappointed a little because it felt too heavy. Maybe a crisper, thinner bread and more jam would help

[The Food]I loved every bit of it. The sandwiches were tightly filled and served up a festival of flavours with every bite. I had the Cubano ($16) and the Cheesesteak ($16). The Cubano was well balanced in terms of flavour, having a hint of spicy from the Aji Verde sauce. Really loved this sandiwch. The cheesesteak was also really good, chunky pieces of meat mixed with cheese. Having said that, I wouldn't have been able to finish the entire Cheesesteak sandwich as it gets a bit 'jerlat' as we Singaporeans would term it. I'd definitely be back again for more!Protip: visit with at least 1 other person so you can trade the other half of your sandwich (they cut it in half for you) and try out the different offerings![The Service and Atmosphere]The staff were all really friendly here! The atmosphere was really laid back too. There's a self service counter for you to pick up your food and labelled bins for you to discard them. Going as a large group may be hard as they have limited seating! Good for couples or a small group of 3-4 people

Park Bench Deli is one of the few eateries that has managed to buck the trend of providing a casual/comfort without being too hipster-ish/pretentious. From its dressed down decor to the staff shouting over the din of the lunchtime/night scene patrons - and it's scrumptious offerings on the menuboard - this deli is definitely worth going to for a hearty, no-fuss lunch.Simply order whatever tickles your fancy and tuck into it while perched atop a high stool - or stand if you can't get a seat. Whatever, it's worth the stand. Recommendations: Cheese Steak, chili tater tots, and the Fried Chicken.

The laid-back atmosphere, and open kitchen means you can just enjoy your sandwich and chill. As most others have said, the Philly cheese-steak is the real deal. It's tasty, with the meat just the right tenderness and the cheese perfectly blends and not overpowering the sandwich. Definitely a fine place for delicious sandwiches
3
the sandwiches are decent but on the expensive side where we paid $16 a sandwich for lunch. better ventilation will be good too.
5
I have only been once, back when it first opened. At the time, the menu was limited, but the items were tantalisingly interesting. I chose the pork prolly sandwich and it was phenomenal. Great bread and inspired tastes.
4
We came for the cheesesteak and were not disappointed. Quality and preparation were very good. Filling was generous and well rounded with what tasted like whiz. Prices are quite high but the quality is there. Atmosphere is wannabe hipster. We also ordered a porchetta sandwich which tasted great but serving size was a little small. The food is god here

I'm vegetarian and this was just a chance find walking along Telok Ayer. The kids had an off menu ham and cheese sandwich and they looooved it. I had the vegetarian and it was just full of different flavors that kept me going at it. had to share with the wife so it was gone in no time. But the cheese on the kids sandwich was so well grilled in. And The decor was relaxing even tho it was benches

Getting a good sandwich at the lunch hour on a busy day is something I consider pure bliss. So it's even better when that sandwich is handcrafted in a way where lots of love and care goes into every element of the sandwich to make it as close to perfection as possible: from the bread, proteins and condiments all the way down to how it is packaged. The guys at Park Bench Deli do it right. I dine here regularly and every sandwich comes out to a high, tasty standard. I used to work in a deli in University making sandwiches, so I know a thing or two about what makes a good sandwich: ratios and bread type are key and Park Bench Deli tends to be spot on in this department. What really separates Park Bench Deli from other sandwich shops is that the ingredients and components of the sandwich are well thought out; every element seems to be meticulously planned down to each raw ingredient - many of which they make or roast on their own from scratch. Price point is higher than your mass market type of sandwich shop obviously, but I find the price reasonable for the quality of what you get. And you'd be hard pressed to find a better, handcrafted sandwich shop in Singapore's CBD at the lunch hour.Service here is also great as the staff is always friendly and smiling; clearly they love what they do

If like me you are not a fan of cold lunches, or sandwiches that look like a salad between two pieces of bread than this is our utopia wonderfully messy sandwiches cooked on a hot plate griddle full of tasty ingredients and covered in messy sauces. I had the fried egg sandwich which has bacon, cheese oozing out the side and the obligatory green item. it was wonderful and I will be back. the fries are great but soooooo many you won't leave here hungry Friendly staff and cool vibe with the music and benches to sit at reasonably priced, expensive if you look at it as a sandwich but once you get it then you understand. pay the extra dollar or two. it's worth it I will be back
4
We had lunch at this casual "deli" and all enjoyed the sandwiches. There is a good selection of drinks from the fridge and it has a hipster/backpacker set up which made the surprising high cost seem expensive for the place. Would recommend to anyone looking for a premium lunch in casual atmosphere
4
The portion of the sandwiches were big. We ordered 2 sandwiches (one each) and it ended too many so I had to take away half of mine. The place is small and not many chairs so be ready to wait during lunch hour. Anyway the sandwiches were delicious
4
Park Bench sandwiches are great and they do have a variety of it. I have to say portions are big so, share if you must. Place is pretty packed with a lot of walk in customers. Great for lunch. If you are feeling very hungry, go for it. They do sell some craft beers so good for beer lovers
4
Park Bench serves some of the best sandwiches in Singspore. Every one that I have had is exceptional - particularly good is their Cuban sandwich...yummy!!! Their happy hour is also excellent! Best place for a craft beer on Telok Ayer. Reasonably well priced and staff are always friendly. Must go
5
The sandwiches are perhaps the best in not just Singapore, but all of Southeast Asia.
I come here at least once a week for lunch.
4
Good sandwiches and definitely very instagramable! Prices are a little on the pricey side (16$ per sandwich) but it's a rather big portion so I guess you can break it down to 2 meals? Get the Cheese Steak but give the Cured Meat a miss cos it tastes like a slightly more atas version of Cold Cut Trio
5
Do arrive early. We arrived at 6pm on a Friday and we were glad that the place was empty (it was crowded by the time we left). We had the peanut butter and jelly (PBJ) sandwich, grilled cheese sandwich, fried drumlets, pork belly rice bowl, acai bowl and the cured meat. First bite into the PBJ and I was in heaven. It's coated with cornflakes, giving the sandwich a really great texture. 2 of us loved the PBJ and the other 2 loved the grilled cheese. I guess you can be either or and not both. I wish the bread wasn't so soggy for the PBJ, but would still go back for it. Could have it all day errday! The other stuff we ordered were so-so, but I must say, those drumlets were terrible. I've never had such bad fried chicken in my life (tasteless). PBD should really remove the drumlet from their menu
4
I had the Smoked Pastrami. It's sinful...but just say your Hail Marys and chomp it down.The meat was sliced just right, the onions and the peppers mixed well with the sauce. I loved every inch of it as all of it comes together really well in your mouth. But as all sins go...after the joy comes the guilt. The 17 dollars you dished out comes back to haunt you...and then the taste leaves your mouth. You go for confession and then promise never to do it again. But you know how some promises go...

While i dont take much carbs, i love sandwiches, pastries and some cakes. However more often than not, places in SGP dont serve hearty delicious sandwiches! In many places, the filling isnt appetizing and the bread can taste v stale... Hence i m always skeptical! PBD makes their bread fresh everyday, from a reliable supplier, they tweaked the recipe until the bread has the texture they are after... The broiche--- MY FAVORITE!!! My favorite sandwich there is THE LOX! The scrambled eggs w smoked salmon is really yummy and goes perfectly w the broiche! It is currently a bfast only item BUT WILL SOON BE ON THE LUNCH MENU TOO YAYPIE! :D

More ore less, sandwich costs between 14-16 SGD. However, what this deli offers is a great alternative for those people like me who has days that hawker food is just enough! There's nothing fancy about the interior of the place but cozy enough for people lunching and enjoying the sandwich of their choice (Can also take away). For today, I've tried the vegetarian. Verdict? Very good! Fresh, huge and really tasty. My husband had a meaty one. His feedback? Well, all smiles! To wrap up our experience over lunch on a busy Monday; well, it's definitely a place we will always come back to for a sumptuous sandwich crave
3
I only had the acai and can only comment on that. It was pretty refreshing, not sweet (which is good I guess) and chock full of granola, grapes and fresh berries. But you pay for it though- at $8.50 a bowl. Other items on the menu look promising but a little overpriced. May come back again for a second try.

Having grown up in the West where delis are a dime a dozen, I really missed digging into some good ol' hearty sandwiches. The places i visited in singapore never really hit the spot as they mostly feel substandard or like sandwiches dressed up as "deli" with an equally fancy price tag. Thankfully PBD brought the deli sandwich game in Singapore to a whole new level. Their sandwhiches are thankfully unpretentious, and their homemade quality is very obvious to the palate - from the hearty bread to the juciy meaty filling between. I had to see what the famous Kong Bak Bahn Mi was about (my grandma makes THE best Kong Bak so the standard was set high) The verdict: Grandma has some serious competition. The generiously stuffed sandwhich was beautifully paired with the refreshing pinch and crunch of the pickled carrot and daikon. I don't know if this sandwhich deserves the Straits Times Best New Dish of 2015 award, but i know i'll be coming back for more on my cheat days. As a big fan of New York Styled Pastrami, I had to sample their homemade pastrami sandwhich served only on 14 Jan. "THICK. CUT." Was promised on the chalk board. THICK CUT was delivered. Avoiding the cheeky inuando, I thoroughly enjoyed every mouthful of this sandwhich. Pastrami sandwhiches, even in New York, make the mistake of making their pastrami either too dry or too salty from the curing process. But what these guys did to the pastrami to keep it juicy and naturally flavoured deserves mention. Now if only they had this on their regular everyday menu....All in all, PBD's sandwiches are pretty unparalleled in Singapore (name one other places with a better grilled cheese sandwhich on this island). Sure, its pricey, but thankfully they are also generously stuffed like a grandma would to their grandkid's lunchbox. The only real downside is, for a health nut like me, I have to ration my visits to PBD.Thankfully, cheat days comes once a week

Singapore certainly has its fair share of snacks and sandwich outlets, to the extent that there seems to have been a dearth of exciting offerings in the sandwich arena over the years. Then came park bench deli.. the one true diamond in the rough. What began as a collaboration between Chef Ming (ex-chef from Lolla), Chef Andrei Soen (Chef of The Cajun Kings) and business partner Aamir Ghani, with their humble beginnings as a pop-up store at various events, has now become THE place in the CBD to either have a grab-n-go or a leisurely breakfast/lunch/dinner. The sandwiches at park bench deli pack a real punch, and the chefs' attention to detail when it comes to the aesthetics and quality of ingredients is impeccable. While the prices may seem slightly steep, it is worth every cent. Having been a fairly regular customer, I have had the opportunity to sample a fair number of their offerings, and what amazes me every time is the fact that every component of each sandwich contributes to the entire flavor profile; from the type of bread, cheese, condiments, sauces and meat, each has been selected purposefully, with majority of the ingredients made in-house. This is the art of sandwich-making at its best. Coupled with the laid back, minimalist but artistically decorated shop interior, park bench deli is revolutionizing the sandwich scene on this island city. And not to forget, they serve czech pilsner on the tap, for a price which would be hard to beat, especially for its quality

We had a fried chicken sandwich; it was soggy, I think cut to the dressing and coleslaw. Not sure how long before we ate this sandwich was made. We ate at 4pm.We also had a cheese steak sandwich, it was plain and lacked seasoning.The seats and tables are narrow, not a good place to have meetings or work with a computer
