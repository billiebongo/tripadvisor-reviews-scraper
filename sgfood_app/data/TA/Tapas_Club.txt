This was our second time here, and the food did not disappoint. Loved the ambience too, and the service was great. Really dislike places that charge you for water, and am glad table water was served and refilled, no questions asked!
4
Quite a bit of variety on the menu. Simple but appetizing. Not too expensive. Good sample of Spanish wines too!
4
Highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to have Spanish tapas. Excellent service and great atmosphere.
5
Super cute place . Affordable wine list and classical tapas at very reasonable price
The best ... the churros ... is worthy to come back only for it .
Service is attentive and fast .
Gracias !

Portion was small so do order more to share. Tasty food but could be salty for people who like bland food. Had churros with candle for birthday celebration, great!

Staff are friendly and attentive, Great food recommendation from one of the staff. Nice and cozy restaurant for chill with family and friends.

There were some hits and misses in our meal. Thumbs up for the paella and thumbs down for the tasteless flat bread with roasted vegetables and anchovies.

A little late but I figure the restaurant don’t really response anyway, especially to bad review. So anyway after reading so many good reviews, we decided to give it a try. Food - To be honest, the selections is not a lot and taste is just alright. For the price, there are much better Spanish/Tapas elsewhere in Sg.Service - TERRIBLE. I just wondering is that particular waiter have a problem with us or just because we didn’t order any wine.. because we are definitely sure that there are other tables that were even there earlier than us and he didn’t chase them. It happened that one of the other table has guest that was my friend’s cousin. 1st he came over and asked if we would like deserts, we said let us take a look and consider because we are still not done with the mains. Then he stood there for few seconds and then said “Don’t get me wrong, I’m not chasing you. You can take your time to decide and have dessert but there is a queue so ya”. I was like thinking SO? Hello we are not the only table! But I didn’t want to spoil our mood and enjoying the company etc so we left it there.What’s next???...a few minutes time he came over and presented us the BILL!!! Of which we didn’t even ask for it and my friend is still having food ( see pic)..and he is not at all apologetic and just pretend didn’t care and walk away...and came back for the card! We were so pissed and guess what friend called her cousin who is still at the restaurant and asked if she experienced the same. Her cousin was shocked said no. Best part, 2hours later her cousin called and said they just left and she saw after we left the restaurant staff then decided to open up the closed area. Really hope if u have a better experience if u decided to try at all. Otherwise, seriously there are way better ones with that kind of pricing.

Had the honour of trying their discounted lunch sets and enjoyed my experience. One local male waiter was super cheery and served us with smiles at all times. Food was delicious and didn't disappoint. Had sangria for additional $3 and as I was a lightweight and worried a little but there was not much alcohol in there so I managed to returned to work sober. ;)My friend ordered the pan fried chicken set with mashed potatoes and I had the chicken paella with omelette. Love the omelette.
5
Celebrated my 12th wedding anniversary there last Saturday! Front desk was friendly. Waiters were too. And service was quite quick even on a busy night. I like the fact that the menu was varied. You get staples like the tomato bread and the manchego and chorizo on toast and the squid ink paella. But there are also interesting ideas like chorizo-stuffed grilled squid, deep fried sardines and beef cheeks and cheese. We had a lovely grilled asparagus with pancetta that came with a truffle-scented mash. And the garlicky gambas came with finger toasts for you to dip into its sauce. The staff remembered it was our anniversary and gave us a slice of fudge brownie cake accompanied by a scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream. Best part? 5 dishes and a glass of Temparillo for under SGD85. We were told that these guys are related to Binomio on Craig Road which is their fine-dining offering. If you like good tapas in a lovely and friendly atmosphere and don’t mind the noise, Tapas Club at Or hard Central is the place to go!
5
Great food, ambience and service !
Definitely worth a return visit :)
Try all dishes because everything was superb!
4
The food is fantastic and the service is very good. It's a great restaurant for gathering with friends or family. relaxing and enjoyable.
5
Me gusta the food there! And the server there is really caring and friendly! I love the churros and the environment! Its a must to have meal at there when u visit orchard central/ orchard gateway.
4
Four of us all chose different plates and each was delicious. The service was good despite the restaurant being really busy. Would definitely recommend this as somewhere to get a great meal.
4
amazing food but slightly understaffed so service is rather slow.nevertheless will return for the food
good for big groups
5
Delicious food, great options, great atmosphere. Service was a little slow, but it was New Year's Eve - to be expected.
4
Place has a nice ambience...mushroom croquette was good! The filling is like thick mushroom soup. Squid ink paella was good too!
5
Had dinner tonight with no reservation made! Bang was so helpful and let us in and what a great night we have had and the gorgeous tapas with excellent taste and presentation!! Thank you Tapas Club team for the awesome service given to us and had a pleasure to meet Chef Manuel Keep up the great workTwo thumbs up
5
I have patronised Tapas Club several times prior to this review. Whether it is peak hour or lull period, the staff here are all friendly and attentive to you! It is unfortunate that the staffs weren't wearing name tags, but the lady with a bob serving me on 5 Jan evening is one of them (management of Tapas Club, I hope you see this and give the lady the commendation that she deserves!).I was pleasantly surprised by the price, and impressed by what was served; unlike many restaurants along the tourist/shopping belt that banks on the location, I feel like effort was made here in terms of balancing between quality and price. The seating of the restaurant is also such a way that it accommodates a large demographic - romantic dates, business meetings, or simply social gatherings.All in all, definitely recommend for anyone to give this place a try
5
A relaxing afternoon lunch gathering with friends. Greeted and served by friendly attentive staffs throughout our long lunch session. Food wise, every dish we ordered was scrumptious. Except the rice from the seafood paella was a tad undercooked, otherwise it will be perfect. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely eat there again
5
The food which my friend and I tried, were excellent. The waiters and waitresses were very polite and attended to our request promptly. The ambience in the restaurant was condusive and creates an excellent mood for dinning.
5
First visit to Tapas Club & really appreciate the excellent service by Bang, the restaurant’s Manager! He goes the extra miles to meet our requests that made all of us feel very welcomed. Will definitely visit again!
5
Padron peppers, croquettes and patatas bravas were excellent, very authentic. Washed down with good beer and churros to finish. Well worth a visit. Gracias.
5
Food was generally good. Service was impeccable as others have said. Pity it's tucked in a corner else perhaps there'd be more patrons!
5
Delicious Tapas set we had for dinner. Good wine selection too. Attentive service excellent as always.
5
Service staff were attentive and cheerful it set the mood for our meal! Tortilla de patatas, chorizo paella (felt that the chorizo could have been more generous though) and churros was tasty. Will be back for more!
5
Food was amazing and super worth the price! Service was an extra plus point too. The staff had mixed up our order with the table beside us because we both ordered the steak main. They served us the steak order that was meant for the other table, so we got served a different side too. However, they readily admitted their mistake, apologised, and served us the sides we ordered (in addition to the dish that got served to us wrongly), without any fuss. At the end of our meal, although a presumably younger/less experienced waiter initially charged us for the extra side and argued that we should pay for it, a more experienced waiter (sadly we forgot to take down his name) took over and corrected the bill promptly. Thanks to the great service, we enjoyed our meal thoroughly
5
I tried this place with some friends living in Singapore and it was a really great experience. Excellent service and very good chef (Manuel). Food is like the real thing you will get in Spain. Prices are reasonable considering that Singapore is not a cheap place to dine out. Also the wine prices are very competitive with a very good selection of wines and cavas from Spain. Highly recommended
4
My husband had taken work colleagues there a few weeks before and loved it, so we went for dinner.Ordered the suckling pig between us and a side of asparagus. The pork was nice and tender and the asparagus tasty. My potato that accompanied the pork was under cooked and they took it away and replaced it - but after I had finished my meal. We ordered the creme brulee and that was very ordinary - the texture was like a sauce that has split and has a furry feel to it and was accompanied by a sorbet that didn't go with it. Others were eating churros and I wish I had ordered them.iThe wine list was great and the wines good. Staff were great and would go back but not order the brulee
5
This was our second visit to Tapas Club. The sausage and ham platter with manchego cheese was as delicious as ever.The sausage paella was piping hot, delicious and filling, good for 2 people. The server suggested an excellent red to go with the meal, chilled perfectly!The staff were very courteous hospitable and friendly.The only change we noticed was the addition of American music to the playlist, some of which were covers by Spanish singing artists.
5
Nice casual vibe, super friendly service, yummy cava sangria and great food. We had, amongst others, the Spanish omelette, mushrooms with crab meat, Brussel sprouts with Romesco sauce, mackerel wiyh pumpkin, vegetables Paella and churros. Loved it!
5
My colleagues and I loved all the dishes that we ordered. We were in love with the suckling pig and the seafood and squid ink paella! Those are definitely a must for anyone who visits the place.
5
Turned up at happy hour was really great. Nice beer and a selection of tapas was just the thing after the long flight from London. Service was good and food excellent.
5
Authentic tapas and a great selection - paired with a good wine list and professional waitstaff. Very well-priced too.
5
Great value for money , delicious food , great selection of tapas . The service was very good too, highly recommended .
5
Love the ambience. Ordered the beef. Could have been better marbled, but generally taste good. Loooooooooove the mashed potato
4
A good choice to spend an evening with friends, sampling tapas and enjoy some good wine. Tapas are good but not great, some better than others,but ok value for money. Wines are affordably priced and they have a good selection
4
Yum yum yum. First time when I was there I didn't get to try a lot of food as just 2 of us but the brussel sprouts, the croquette and the iberico pork was very good! I didn't really like the suckling pig as I find the skin not crispy enough & a bit too fatty for me. Went there 2nd time and already feel like I will go back the 3 times!! This time I tried the grill pork, churro are very yummy but the shout out dish is the pineapple yoghurt desserts! It is so refreshing... definitely coming back for the dessert!! I also love the way they did the menu... totally helpful for pp to know what they Will be eating
5
The services is good. I was waiting for my friends and my food has been served as I didn’t tell them to hold my food at the beginning. It’s very thoughtful of them to ask if we need to heat up our food :) the food are very delicious. A great place for gathering on Friday night.
1
Expected quite alot based on the reviews and expensive prices but were hugely disappointed. All of the 6-7 tapas were either re-heated, overcooked and even burned at the same time. One star purely for the good service and cold cut ham they weren't able to mess up. Anyone who has been to Spain do yourself a favour and skip this one
4
Reasonably priced tapas with hearty portions. Very good service provided by attentive staff. It’s ideal for group dining.
3
Celebrating hubby birthday. Food ok, nice ambience, friendly staff. A bit disappointing because after confirming, few days later were asked to change date due to a close door party on the chosen date.
5
Tried some different items this time, including the Inberico platter and some Sangria to wash it down. The place was busy at our 7:30 visit but the food and service didn't falter. We'll be back.
5
Dinner at Tapas Club was fantastic! The service from the reception to the billing was just superb! Great ambiance, attentive servers and most importantly, great and delicious food
5
Great food and atmosphere, friendly service. Highly recommended for any occasion whether family or with friends!
4
Went to Tapas Club with my colleagues. We had a nice time with really good food and service. Thanks guys for a great night.
4
They are usual very pack on Friday and Saturday evening, so I would always keep in mind to make a reservation first before heading now. They tie with Chope, so booking with them is extremely hassle free.Lunch menu is pretty affordable and quality food.And I would recommend opening a bottle of wine as compared to glass. The pricing is pretty reasonable and you beat the crazy queue which Wine Connection is having
4
Must try- Mushroom croquettas, gamba alijio and Seafood chicken paella. Place can get crowded on Friday , Saturday nights .not able to linger around for too long, eat and go as the crowd tends to swell from 730pm onwards. however the only issue that night was the payment system by the local bank was down. No card payment except using cas
5
This time was with a colleague from overseas who in fact had just had a holiday in Spain. The food here is delicious, the service attentive yet not intrusive. We arrived at 6:30 and by 8:30 the place was quite busy. Many other diners appeared to be enjoying themselves. Iâ€™ll be back.
5
A first for me in Singapore; outstanding restaurant customer service. We only had 45mins, and was running out of time. The food was taking a while to come out due to busy lunch service and we explained to the waiter we didn't have much time left. At no charge, they provided alternative food at no extra cost that was readily available (cold cuts), and a complimentary wine to apologize (even though they were not at fault). The food quickly followed and was absolutely amazing! Highly recommending the lamb short ribs with sprouts, and the pork shoulder. Everything was high quality and really well priced. I would highly advise finding this place; great tapas food and sharing plates for friends and family!
5
We loved our meal, the service was top quality. Will definitely dine there again when we visit Singapore.
5
It is the best spanish restaurant in Singapore with Spanish chef.
There is a small mart can shop the drink and food.
Decent decor
Great Music
4
The place has a setting decked out in Spain’s icons - such as street names and flamenco music.
The tapas are available from $5-$20+, which is on the cheaper end for tapas in Singapore. Taste was great to match as well. I would come back.
4
restaurant has nice decorations and waiters are attentive.
food was tasty but portions were small.
i understand tapas are small bites but i would expect the paella to be sizeable.
the sauce for gambas was the highlight.
5
Good food and service for Spanish food. Nice ambience and you can have a drink after the dinner. Staff are friendly too. Easier to enter by the escalator opposite the post office
5
Great experience with conducive and vibrant environment. Waiters are helpful. However, price is a little high and location of restaurant is not so ideal
5
The selection of food is authentic Spanish while it is very tasty, the servers were attentive. Good dining experience.
4
Food was great. Service staff were courteous and friendly. Paella could stand to be slightly bigger - was told that it would feed 4-5, but was brought a pan fit for 2 -3 persons at best
4
Was the first time there and both the food and service did not disappoint. Appreciate the staff's attentiveness as water was always topped up and they took the initiative to halt the dishes from the kitchen when they saw that one of our friends have yet to arrive. Food portions were best for sharing and we thoroughly enjoyed the beef steak and Spanish omelette. Upon knowing that we were celebrating a bday, they were quick to provide a candle and even surprised us with an additional dessert :) kudos to the team for a wonderful service!
5
Sunday dinner with Mum at Tapas Club. Decked out in fire-engine-red, this new kid at Orchard Central dishes out authentic and affordable tapas and Spanish cuisine - still as good on this return visit. Straight from the Josper oven comes the smoky Padron Peppers, so irresistible we'd to have seconds. Must-order are the tender and aromatic Seabass with Garlic & Chilli with a side of grilled vegetables; and the Prawns steeped in a garlicky olive oil, best mopped up with the crusty bread. End with the Stuffed Churros, filled with mouthwatering chocolate and vanilla cream. What better way to enjoy this sumptuous dinner than with a bottle of Giro Ribot Brut Rose, a dry and refreshing Cava boasting a strawberry aroma that balances the savoury tapas
4
Food and sangria has its hits and misses but definitely the service is of a excellent level. Good place to chillax and celebrate with friends or colleagues.
4
Excellent choices, friendly service, reasonable prices... good value and great music! Location ok...
3
Octopus: overcooked, too chewy
Steak: good. Get the mashed potatoes & Brussels sprouts to go with
Jamon croquettes were good.
Bit pricey for the portions.
5
Great selection of tapas, mains and wine. Well seasoned and impeccably balanced dishes. Especially the seabass and beef cheeks!
3
Friendly service, but ambience was terrible and tacky. Food is average. Hearty, but average. Had the manchego ham on toast with pickles, chicken and seafood paella, and a fried chicken with ham and cheese. The Paella was underwhelming. Fried chicken wasn't too bad, pretty moist and the manchego ham on toast was good as well. They forgot our beef cheeks so we cancelled it after we had all the underwhelming food. Overall average. The music was too loud too.
1
I read a good review about this restaurant so I came to check it out last Saturday. Unfortunately I was sorely disappointed as the food took ages to arrive. Our paella was our last dish but it took about 40 minutes to arrive! When it arrived, the dish was disappointing and it was masked with the taste of peas. We also ordered the beef steak which turned out really dry. Overall a very disappointing experience.
4
Visited here with my partner and friends, and we were not disappointed with the food served. I've been to Tapas Club before for work-related appointment and so, I was excited to return to enjoy more of the Spanish food. The patatas bravas is a must-order if you're a fan of potatoes, it was really yummy and flavourful. The cold cut platter is worth going for if you're going in a group of 3-4pax, though I didn't like the complimentary bread that comes with very much. Still prefer the plain bread that's served with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The steak was so-so in my book, so proceed with caution. No visit to a Spanish restaurant is complete without paella, so it's obviously a must-order. Go for the squid ink paella if you're adventurous. And don't leave without savouring the churros!!! Do go for the classic one, and don't bother with the stuffed one. The cream stuffing didn't do much, and the churros was on a thicker side for the stuffed version. Will definitely come back again when my Spanish craving strikes
4
Tapas - the Spanish version of Chinese dim sum - excellent place to share food. Love the menu - has all the pictures and descriptions of the tapas thus making choices easy. Our favorites - tomato bread (looks simple but the tomatoes were delicious), garlic prawns (comes with bread and the sauce is the yummy part), padron peppers (grilled with a sprinkling of salt and squeeze of lemon), pork shoulder, squid ink paella and mashed potatoes (looks like thick mushroom soup but tastes really good!). Service was excellent - friendly, attentive (despite a busy Saturday dinner time) and knowledgeable. The sangria served by the bottle was really good - the beautiful individual glasses provided for the sangria were filled with ice and this made the sangria go a long way
5
I arrived at the restaurant with little knowledge of Spanish food. I left with a full belly and a cheerful smile. The menu has vegan, vegetarian and other introlerance options. I started my journey into Spanish food by having Gambas ajillo (garlic prawns). They were spicy yet not overpowering. Next up was the Chicken and Seafood Paella. As a foodie, I love to burrow my way into cultures through food. I found my new favourite dish. It also came with a side of roasted vegetables, which were just plain delicious. An acquaintance, who I know has always hated brussel sprouts, tried the side of brussel sprouts with romesco sauce, and stole the remainder of the dish. Lastly, you go to a Spanish restaurant without at least trying the Churros (they had three variations!)
4
Tapas club has a good variety of food at good prices and portions. The garlic prawns were really good especially the sauce. There were only 2 of us and hence didn't have a chance to try more selections. Would definitely visit again for other dishes.Service was great. Was promptly seated and staff were polite and always ready to help.Restaurant is located on level 2 at the extreme end of Orchard Central away from 313
5
Good service and great food are a rarity these days, this place has both and we enjoyed it and believe me, the taste will transport you to Spain Ola! Will definitely come back soon, we love love Spanish cuisine
5
The tapas served was delicious and authentic like the ones I had in Spain recently. The sangria was also nice. Service was great too!
4
Good food coupled with the great hospitality of its staff makes it an excellent place for a date to gathering
5
There were plenty of choices from the menu and each dish that I happened to order turn out to be nice. The prices were affordable too!
5
We had ordered the cheese platter, garlic prawns, patatas bravas, chicken and seafood paella, and red wine to go with the food. Great food and ambience. Highly recommended.
4
Good to see that orchard road has a good spanish restaurant. we had the jamon croquettas, paella mixta( clams and prawns) , gambas alijilo and churros . All dishes were pretty good. Paella can be shared between three persons.
4
Recently visited as a last minute decision on a Saturday afternoon, early evening Booked online at 3pm for a 6pm table. Restaurant called us back immediately to confirm booking. Service was very fast by a team of pleasant waiting staff Food was great with a highlight being the fried peppers. Would highly recommend a visit if you are fancying a bit of Tapas while in town My only watch out, the floor is as slippery as hell. Obviously a bit too much polish used this week.
5
Lunch set with a main, side and drink were extremely worth it, only downside is that there were only 3 sets, which would undeniable bore the working class around there, but the food was good, portion sizes were good, and service was fantastic as well! The other food albeit more pricey looked more interesting, i might go back to try other choices if I'm feeling riche
3
We ordered a few dishes to share. In terms of food wise: We had egg omelette and pork shoulders as starters. Those were not bad. We shared the seafood paella as main course - we were looking forward to this the most but ended up disappointed. The paella was tad too moist and we didn't know how to quite appreciate its flavour. We thought it has a "metallic" taste, if it makes sense? We ended the course with churros with chocolate dip, which salvaged the entire meal in the end. The pricing wise is on the high side but that's how Tapas work after all I guess. Nevertheless, overall was a good experience
4
The food portion and taste is good . The different grade of Ambar beer was very nice . The different type of glass ware to go with the beer add a touch of class to drinking beer . My only problem is the table . It was somehow not stable and shaking whenever I rest my arm on the table . I have to share my focus on the food and drink with worry of anything topple over.
5
Was a lovely new restaurant. I went there to celebrate my friend's birthday. The food and atmosphere was awesome!
5
Went there for a quick lunch after the nice dinner: Nice quality food with excellent service. Will go back again for sure
4
Great food and service at a reasonable price. The only flaw was the waiter did not point out an on going special offer. I only realised this on the way out of the restaurant where they had a poster advertising it.
5
Quick and friendly service, good wines pricing, portions could be a little bigger but good taste of tapas. All in all a good evening
4
Surprisingly the quality of the food was better than we expected. Nice ambience for casual dining. Service was good and servers were attentive. They bother to listen to feedback which is very important
4
One of the better and more value for money spanish food I've eaten in the country. Atmosphere was normal. The side furnishing juts out a bit and knocks peoples head if they accidentally lean backwards, saw quite a few people hitting their heads.
5
Ambience was great. Food portions just right, can try different food due to its portion. Great for bday celebration:)
5
After reading lots of good reviews for this new restaurant and being a lover of Spanish food, I booked asap and was not disappointed. Great selection, very tasty and a good selection of veggie options for one of our party.The staff were friendly and accommodating - with the added bonus of giving advise on both the food and wine when asked - which you can't always find in Singapore.I'll definitely be returning
4
came here with a friend on a Sunday, pretty quiet. the menu was pretty good, had many options and I liked that they had picture references as well. we tried a couple of dishes including the garlic prawns, chorizo paella, shrooms with crab meat, and the beef steak.we loved everything ordered and it went quite well with the wine that was recommended. pretty good tapas right in the heart of orchard road
2
I would give it a one star, except for all the other reviewers liking it so much. We just came back from 6 weeks in Spain and thought we'd try it (we're Spanish). It is without a doubt worse than anything we'd go to in Spain. The food was bland across the board. We had to ask for salt and this was an entire endeavour for them to provide. Every single dish needed salt. The potatoes were very bland, spongy (like food from the microwave or otherwise reheated), and burnt. The pan con tomate was good (not great but good). The garlic shrimp were squishy (again they had to be reheated). This is one of the easiest dishes to make fresh, so why would you reheat? I know when sizzling gambas al ajo are fresh. These weren't sizzling. They were barely hot. And they were squishy. OK next the lamb. Again, clearly reheated. The flavour was not nice. About the mayo they use on nearly every dish. It is almost certainly home made, but... not to Spanish palates. I'm disappointed as Spanish restaurants are quite poor in Singapore, and was hoping this would be part of a better bunch. Perhaps on a Friday night the dishes are freshly made, but at lunch, clearly, they went overboard on the pre-made.
3
Some dishes were quite bland. Almost each dish comes with "mayonnaise" sauce and would prefer if it could be more flavorful without it.
Service, dessert and location are good.
5
Service may be a bit lacking but which restaurant in Singapore isn't?
The prawns and some glass noodle thingy in a pan are awesome.
The pork collar can skip.
The sea bass is excellent too.
5
Our table was ready when we arrived. Service was quick and food came out within 5minutes of us ordering. The wine list is pretty good and I recommend the sea bass. Perfectly cooked! Casual atmosphere, I'd go again.
4
We enjoyed ourselves on a night out. The food was tasty, well-presented and a good size. Our waiter was very attentive and informative.
3
We took some friends who were visiting to the restaurant. Overall the food was tasty, and ambiance was lively. The table they gave us was just too small for a group of 7, to think that I booked in advance. We had to hurry eating some of the tapas just to make space for the 2 paellas we ordered. It's a shame the staff didn't really make an effort or seem to be bothered about it insisting food should fit
4
As Spaniards, we looked for a place that could evoke the tasted that we are used to feel at home. We ordered four different dishes including croquetas de jamon, cachopo, paella and pan con tomate. We have to say that the quality was good and the price for the portion size was excellent. The croquetas were nice, the ones that you can find at many bars in Spain. Pan con tomate was specially yummy. Cachopo was average, fine but lacking the taste of a strong cheese or the jamon serrano, as we like in Spain. And finally, the paella was enjoyable, not the best in the world but well cooked.We will be back 100% sure. Gracias por una noche deliciosa
5
You need to pre-book to secure your seats on a weekend!Great hangout place to be for Friday nights especially!We had so much food and if we had more people, we would probably end up ordering every single tapas!1 - JAMÓN IBÉRICOGood portion for the price but no option to pay more for a longer aged jamon.8 - CROQUETAS DE JAMÓNGreat croquettes, crispy!9 - CHIPIRONES CON HUEVO FRITOBaby squid, deep fried with egg yolk as a dip, fantastic!\13 - TORTILLA DE PATATASPotato omellete, got cheated as we thought it was pure egg but it is a good dish14 - GAMBAS AL AJILLOGarlic prawns, good especially the sauce! If there was a bowl of rice, it would be great!16 - PIMIENTOS DEL PADRÓNGreen peppers - So good that we had a second serving30 - PLUMA DE CERDO & 34 - FILETE DE TERNERA Grilled pork and beef, nicely done.37 - ARROZ NEGROSquid ink paella, it is awesome, savoury and tasty. The portion is just nice for a few people to eat.29 - CACHOPOFRIED CHICKEN, this is so good that I forgot to take a picture!!!43 - CHURROS CON CHOCOLATE & 46 - CHURROS RELLENOSNeedless to say, churros forever! Could take endless churros if I am not dieting.The drinks are also reasonably priced and the damage to the pocket is managable!Would definitely visit again
5
Good food with great service. Our waiter was attentive, cheerful and helpful with any questions we had. Finding the unit itself a bit confusing because of the way the building is structured. Should take the escalator at the corner of the mall (junction of Orchard Rd and Killiney), this goes direct to the restaurant
4
My 3rd visit, I am always surprised by their good service level. During my lunch visit, I prefer to be seated at the corner away from the crowd and at the same time getting the view of busy orchard and kitchen. Downside for corner table to might get lesser attention from the floor staff but their head chef is always attentive to get the staff for us.There is once i have to leave the restaurant for a short while to pick up my lost friend, the kind chef offer to keep my untouched food under the heater device (not sure what is it called?) so when I am back food will still be warm and tasty. Seriously this gesture makes me want to come back more and more.So yea the restaurant is situated within a complicating mall - Orchard Central, seem like all my friends have a hard time locating. But it is worth the search - good service, great foods and affordable wines. The only area lacking I would said is the available choices of food in their menu. So far all that I tried are amazing but Singapore is an interesting country, we are flooded with food choices. To stay attractive I suggest they should come out with more choices, or even some seasonal dish than I will be more than happy to return at least once in a month.
5
Very happy to have come across this newly opened tapas restaurant! We had 5 excellent tapas dishes here on Saturday evening plus the chorizo paella and were highly satisfied with each, from the croquettes to the grilled peppers, patatas bravas, grilled brussel sprouts and the beef cheeks - all delicious and all great value for money.The draught Ambar beer was good, too, and the wine list is probably the most reasonable in Singapore - add this to great authentic Spanish food, efficient, knowledgeable and friendly service and a casual sociable atmosphere and you get a restaurant we will certainly return to regularly
5
Spanish Chef Manuel runs a tight kitchen at Tapas Club, churning out affordable yet delectable Spanish cuisine. The simple Seabass with garlic and chilli comes with a thin layer of fragrant olive oil; absolutely delicious and unbeatable value at $18!
4
Tapas club has a very relaxed ambience - feels like you are taking a siesta in Spain! The chicken and seafood paella was absolutely delicious - slightly wet and full of flavor!
4
We visited on a Saturday evening, seated just before 7pm. The place got pretty busy from 7.30 onwards so reckon you'll need a booking. The service was pleasant and efficient. They have $8 Ambar on tap for beers and sangria bottles if you prefer. We ordered the baby sardines, loved them, garlic prawns, no frills, authentic. Cold cut platter, great ham and chorizo and quantity. I can't understand why this place can give you quality and quantity and a decent price when other places fail miserably. We also had the beef cheeks and chicken+seafood Paella. The Paella I wasn't so find off, felt it needed more time on the heat, get the crispy base. Was kind of like a risotto rather than paella, that's maybe a bit harsh. Chocolate tart and churros for desert. Overall cracking feed, will be back many times

We ordered 5 dishes between the two of us, and the Tapas Club even threw in a surprise complimentary dish, which was very welcome, but meant that we were stuffed by the end. The portion sizes were slightly larger than we expected for tapas, which I'm not complaining about, but you should probably order one dish less than you think you need and go from there. We had:Jamon croquettes - Creamy bechamel croquettes with chopped jamon inside and thinly shaved jamon on top - this was delicious and probably our favouritePork belly terrine - Compressed pork mince with celeriac - the terrine pieces were tasty, but I enjoyed the well prepared vegetables and gravy moreGarlic prawns - Prawns in a saffron garlic sauce with a few pieces of bread to soak up the sauce - definitely the least inspiring dish; the prawns were 'meh' and it just wasn't compelling to eatBeef rump - Sliced beef (we had ours medium rare) with aioli and a side of mashed potatoes - the beef was perfectly cooked, if slightly under seasoned, while the mashed potatoes were smooth and creamy; some kind of stock was mixed in to give it a different dimensionPotato, jamon and egg (complimentary) - Fried and mashed potato, with a generous portion of jamon and a runny egg on top - the potato was slightly charred, which somehow added to our enjoyment of the dish; the combination worked well togetherSquid-ink paella - Paella with small pieces of chopped squid, small clams and dots of aioli - my partner enjoyed this a lot, but I felt that the stock lacked savouriness and it was underwhelming - I'd suggest more salt, and maybe some roasted red capsicum to add sweetness; the soccarat was good though In all, we spent $92 without any drinks, but we left very full and satisfied, and could probably have done with one fewer dish. My favourite part was the quick, efficient, helpful and friendly service we received from start to finish.

Hidden in a corner of OC is a tapas gem! Opening up the menu with food pictures all lined up nicely is so appetizing. Ordered the garlic prawns where the lightly toasted bread so well matched with the juice from the prawns; the beef check so tender and beetroot compliments it very well given that I am not a beetroot fan; potato braves was comfort food with egg and parma ham; fried sardines not too oily and brings me back to italy where I had awesome fried anchovies! would be great if there is a slice of lemon to squeeze over it too; churros with chocolates was one of the best i had, chocolates sauce not too sweet and churros was with the right texture and not too oily. Only disappointment is the creme bulee where we later know from the waiter that the texture is supposed to be a bit mushy unlike the usual pudding like we have though the mandarin orange sorbet was great! (waiter kindly exclude the creme bulee from our bill) Red wine sangria was so affordable and easy to drink. Like the ambience where it is not too dark and music at the right volume, decor was great, cosy place to dine and catch up with frens! Will definitely come again:)

This restaurant is managed by the chef from binomio. Given how expensive decent Spanish restaurants can be, this place is quite affordable, unlike its higher-end sister restaurant. The food was not as fantastic as binomio, but still quite good. I was quite surprised that the paella arrived like 10 min after we ordered it and it was still decent. The steak and the croquettes were good too. The service was not bad. I would like to visit this restaurant again

As opposed to Binomio, the prices at Tapas Club were extremely reasonable, particularly the wine. This allowed us to have a nice boozy evening with an enjoyable spread without burning a huge hole in my pocket. Dishes we liked:Ham croquettes (5pcs with some iberico slices on top)Mushroom croquettes (5pcs)Chicken and Seafood Paella (portion size was reasonable for 3 carb-conscious ladies to share, tasty and I liked the crispy bits of rice I scraped off the pan)Garlic prawns (came with toasted bread to dip into the sauce, prawns were more shrimp like but tasty)Sea bass (you could choose a side and we had the asparagus, which was also good. We liked this so much we ordered it twice!! Portion is pretty reasonable for the price of 18$)Churros w dark chocolate sauce (churros were coated w cinnamon sugar, fresh and crispy.)We didn't particularly enjoy the sardines that much but we ordered it to go with the wine. Menu could do with abit more seafood variety but that's a personal preference as we do not eat meat. Overall an enjoyable experience and would go back sometime, especially if there are seasonal specials or variations in the menu. Service was attentive and friendly. But we absolutely loathed the useless plates and cutlery because the utensils kept slipping down the plate or dropped onto the floor which was a pain and annoying. We were informed by the staff that these would be changed soon and I'm glad they realised it was problematic :)

Wine + Dinner = Winner!That’s was written on the barrel top hanging in newly opened TAPAS Club at Orchard Central! And it was a sure Winner for us when we dined there last night.The gambas al ajilo (prawns with garlic & parsley) is a must order! Prawns were fresh, and not overcooked, & with the toasted bread that we dipped into the sauce – simply shiok!Hubby’s fav dish was the squids stuffed with chorizo ! The ink sauce is not overpowering and the squids were tender.This is a Spanish restaurant, so of course, we had to order a paella! Chicken & Seafood paella since we had squids tapas The rice was moist and flavourful and the portion was just right, even for 2 persons.I want to go back again to try the Squid ink Noodles paella which I was told is a hit with their customers.Hubby was especially pleased with the Spanish wines ! My 75ml glass of Sweet wine – Mistela Miss Tela cost only $5/-!He liked his red wine – Tavera so much that he bought a bottle. There is a 25% discount for retail wine!After our dinner, we were outside the restaurant, looking at the board showing the Lunch promo - $12.90 per Tapas set! We met the chef, friendly Manuel Berganza who is a One Star Michelin Chef. He shared his vision of making Tapas Club a restaurant with good Spanish food at reasonable prices in a casual environment.I must mention that altho there were only 2 waiters and the restaurant manager last night, they never lacked their attentive service. Lim Jian Bang, the friendly restaurant manager, is very knowledgeable , having worked in many restaurants locally and abroad. We appreciated his info on their lovely glassware.We are definitely coming back

I've always enjoyed immaculately prepared food for sharing and Tapas club did not disappoint. They have a good variety of options from cold meats to the usual Spanish fare to great desserts. Spacing was a little tight but decent.Best part of my experience was the service crew. They were attentive and knowledgeble about the food I ordered. Would definitely be back!

We just had an excellent evening at the Tapas Club. The food was really good and our sever Emmanuel made the best. We stopped by a couple days earlier and he took time to tell us about the restaurant and the food. Based on that brief exchange, we decided to reserve for our group. So glad we did. Definitely recommend for a nice fun dining experience where you can enjoy a nice food and still enjoy visiting with your dining partners in a very pleasant setting.
