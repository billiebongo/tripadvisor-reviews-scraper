Nice place with very good atmosphere , great selection of wines and very good value for money . Only complaint is that they only serve wine - so it’s a real winebar.

Evening catch up with an old mate as I passed through Singapore.
Good wine, well priced and a pleasant atmosphere, will go again!

I love to come here with friends to share some wine, as the bottled options are better and will, if you are a few, be more reasonable and value for money if you share. Lovely beautiful french wines from various districts and regions. Really a place to visit if you are to start your wine understanding, including a chat with the extremely friendly and helpful staff. I have been here many times, and my initial visits they also made a homemade quick lorraine. Which, after years in France, is till date the best quiche ever. To go here after work is a bit of a risk, you may never get from here, hence its better to have a few more food options available, or a larger variety from your neighbouring restaurant friends. Merci

Great selection of wines, although priced on the high side for a wine bar per sé. Only had arugula tomato Parmesan balsamic salad minus the Parmesan. Chef must have forgotten. Duck rillettes were nice indeed. Service was friendly when you could get it. It was not busy; more like quiet. Although the servers were well informed and helpful, they just weren't looking out for anyone possibly needing attention. The ambiance is fine except for the interrogation like lighting. A dimming system would be worth the expense here

Le Quinze Vins has a fantastic selection of wines. The staff is super friendly and helped me to navigate the list (I’m not particularly knowledgeable about French wine) to select the sort of wine we were looking. He gave us three options to choose from and some details to distinguish them, we choose and were super happy. I guess the staff are all oenologists, so I’m not surprised at his talent in selecting the sort of bottle we wanted.The atmosphere is great. What I would expect of a chic wine bar in a shophouse. Empty bottles - all different vintages and regions of France - decorate the walls. It’s not cheap. But it’s a wine bar downtown in Singapore. Treat yourself sometime to a bottle or two here.

I had been to the branch of LQV in Central, Hong Kong so was keen to check this outpost of the group. It has a huge array of wines at what seem like reasonable prices in the local context, where good wines are not cheap owing to the tax policies of the Singapore government. Our group of 4 was just looking for an early evening drink before exploring the area and sampled a Domain de Triennes Provence Rose at $SG60 along with a charcuterie plate charged at $SG39 (note that prices that are listed at this venue include the local VAT and service so there is no more to pay, unlike most Singapore venues where you have to add 7% VAT and 10% service charge to the quoted price). I happened to chat with the manager Romain Michaud and in a remarkable coincidence I had been to all 3 of the venues where he had previously worked, in Auckland, Hong Kong and Lyon France respectively. The only comment I would make is that they only have stool seating. The addition of some more comfortable table and chair seating would be a good move

Why they bother opening for lunch on a friday I do not know.We were the only teo customers which clearly annoyed a very sullen barman. The charcuterie was disgusting and stale, the goose rillettes came in the shop bought jar and were tasteless and over chilled. The wine list was ok but nothing really special. You have to perch on hugely uncomfortable stools and the whole place has the atmosphere of a morgue. I am told it does good business in the evening which I find hard to believe. This place will not survive and it does not deserve to
