Wasn't very impressed. Standard drinks offer. Mostly regular customers go here. Seating is indoor/outdoor, but not very comfortable

Conny is lovely and Chris behind the bar always remembers your name the closest thing to a local for me in SG. Good beer, great food, lovely people, sport on the TV.

Great food. Especially Sunday lunch. Live sports and good friendly service.
Not open on a Saturday morning.

This pub/eating house offered reasonable fair and good company. The happy hour offers changed daily and encouraged customers to come in. The TVs showed sports all day. Worth a visit

Very good fish & chips! Their chicken chop is good too, but ask for the black pepper sauce. The chicken chop also come with a yummy stir-fried kailan. Check out their happy hour deals.

A superb little suburban after work pub with exceptional food. Great steaks, simple dishes, caters to all tastes, Western, Asian with a varied and very tasty menu.

We have a living room where girls are pretty, the food is awesome, beers are cold, other drinks taste like heaven. Plus the best doggie bag ever. Oh and the music just wants you to stay alllll night.

Have been here couple of times..Good flow of drinks coupled with decent food. The biggest positive is the people -they try to give it a good local English pub feel- though it seems the management has undergone a Change recently, it seems they were kind enough to retain most of the staff. I always find it difficult to get good western food in Singapore at an affordable price but this one does justice to a decent extent- the Shepherd's pie that I had today was good. Even their local flavours like Phad thai was good when we had that earlier. Football watcher's paradise!! All in all, a good place to go and have a couple of drinks with some fun conversations
