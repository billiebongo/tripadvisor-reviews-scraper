Nice place tuck away in Raffles City. Pleasant staff, no gst no service charge.
Ordered Hawaiian Pizza, large portion enough to feed 2 adults 2 kids.
Pizza came with a pleasant twist, wasn't tomato based - try it!

Ate there twice during a week stay in Singapore. Staff & owner friendly. For lunch 1 day we shared a margarita pizza and the second time we got take away (family size - 1/2 margarita and 1/2 New Yorker). Base was nice and crispy. Can't fault the pizza or service and would recommend to friends

~Sally recommended we team lunch at The Pizza Place at Raffles City and we arrived without a reservation (prolly not necessary)~although not full it was a self service order place where I'd to give my order at the cashier and someone will deliver it to the table, it saved manpower yet kitchen organization prolly was lacking when we were there~affordably priced yet extensive Italian menu yet prolly too ambitious for the size of the kitchen & crew as the missed an order of pizza and delivered it almost when we were donethe memorable fish fingers & truffle fries sides were overtaken by the pizza order messes, while it's ok for a lunch it's not for a quick one :

I've been recommending this place forever to all my university friends (SMU), we're located near raffles city and this place, this place is NOT TO BE MISSED.Love that they have no service charge or gst, and that their truffle fries are THE BOMB, you have to order this! I had this before I went overseas and I really really love it. Their pizzas allow you to mix flavour (eg half 1 flavour, half another) which is good for a group of friends to share.I came here too many times. There was once for the truffle fries after a bad day and it was slightly disappointing, my boyfriend told the staff it wasn't like the previous one and they took it back and gave me another batch with no questions asked.There was one time I left my handphone here, and i only realise after I walked a 15minute back to school. I panicked and went back, and realise it wasn't at my seat. The moment i asked the staff, they took it out as they kept it aside waiting for me to claim it when they were clearing the tables. Best service ever!!!!

Great place for a quick lunch in the Raffles City Shopping Centre. Nothing fancy, but friendly service, pizzas freshly made to order and the home made iced lemon tea was delicious. Look out for the set lunch special until 3pm - even better value. So good we went twice in three days

Went on weekend to have dinner with my boyfriend. No GST No SERVICE CHARGE. Price was good for 2 pax. Order Magherita Regular pizza, Lasagna spinach baked, truffle fries, calamari. The Magherita was excellant, lots of cheese on top. I liked the bread as well. match well with the cheesy stuff. Lasagna was nice too. The sauce was great. I preferred the truffle fries to the calamari, but my boyfriend said both were nice. so thumbs up for the food here. We did not have to wait very long for the food to arrive. If you do not want to spend too much and also want to have a good and filling meal, this is the place to go to

We dropped by here last night looking for a quick bite before retiring for the day.A 15 minute turn around was fine & the BBQ chicken pizza was cooked to perfection & delivered to our table.My wife didn't want capsicum so we were minus that as I wasn't really fussed if I had it or not. It's a small dine in place but you can order & take away as well if you wish.They were playing some lovely quiet back ground music as well to set the atmosphere.A very hygienic & smart handling idea was for the utensils to come out in it's own special tray (see attached image). You know sometimes how unevenly weighted knives & forks can be, so this is also another great way for their distribution & collection. Must make waiting a whole lot more simple / has great OHS& W benefits. Another great thing I didn't realise until after I ordered was that at each table their was a standard order form that I could have filled out & used.This takes out all the guess work from your order re: any mis-understandings due to my Aussie language.All in all, a great experience & will search them out next time we're here in Raffles City.Happy 50th Singapore!!! :

We ordered the laksa pesto pasta and the aglio olio scrimp pasta, the laksa pesto pasta is creatively cooked with grounded curry leaves, lending a strong curry aroma to the linguine. Definitely recommended for curry lovers.Aglio olio scrimp pasta on the other hand is just plain salty and no scrimp taste.Therefore, I only recommend the laksa pesto pasta

Food is not too expensive.I tried the pizza and truffle fries. The pizza edges were crispy, and the tomato base tasted authentic, but it could have had more mozzarella cheese (to adhere the ingredients together, pizza toppings kept coming off with each bite). I haven't tried many truffle fries but it was addictive, best eaten while they're hot and sprinkled with parmesan if it's your preference.Overall, good quality of food and service. Wide variety of pizza.For Muslim customers, the restaurant is not halal-certified as they sell beer but the meat is from halal suppliers according to the restaurant owner.It's a little hard to find,but it's along the circumference of Raffles City Shopping Centre's basement 1. Quite small but not too crowded

Very nice pizza and pasta. Not too expensive. The restaurant is quite small. I had lunch there twice with small children (2-5 years old) and they loved the food.

I have stopped here twice for lunch while staying in Singapore on business. I had the pasta one day and pizza another day and the food was good. The staff is very good.

if you wish to satisfy your pizza appetite, this is the place
the pizza is affordable, a lot of variety, taste wise is good
we don't dine in as the place is relatively small
have to read the floor map to find this place

Our pizzas were delicious! The base was the right thickness and there was a wide variety of delicious toppings. Really enjoyed it.

We found this place by chance when we were craving for pizza. Though it's quite unnoticeable since it's on the far most corner of B1, we're glad that we ate here. Pizza size is acceptable and taste is good especially their cheesy fries. Will come back here if there's another pizza craving.

Tucked in the corner of basement 1 and it took us a little while before we can locate them. Pretty good selection of Pizzas. Pizza was alright and so are the side dishes and salad. Nothing fantastic to talk about. However, the mushroom soup is good. Rich mushroom flavor and good consistency. Might return to try out the other choice of Pizza.Service is generally good

Was looking for a good place to eat pizza with my family. After a lot of search and reading different reviews, settled on The Pizza Place. Did not regret the decision at all. We ordered 3 pizzas, their linguine with meat balls and a baked dish. Kids loved it. Overall value for money and taste. It's a family run business and therefore the quality and service is great! Would recommend this place

We went to this eatery as our daughter wanted spaghetti meatballs, after we had paid and drinks were bought out a waiter informed us that this dish was not available, we then had to select another item off menu at extra cost. The meals were very average, spaghetti pasta was very bland, the spinach lasagne I ordered was floating in cheese, mushy. If you want very bland food, this may be an option, not value for money as you can get flavoursome food in surrounding outlet

Its a cosy place that serves those who loves pizza and pasta. It's affordable and portion is adequate. I like the mushroom pasta and hawaiian pizza alot. Ambience is just so-so but who can ask for more then the price is affordable.. a good place for a meet-up with friends.

Whilst searching for a quick bite to eat I stumbled across this place it was quite cheap compared to other places in the food court and the food tasted amazingly good. For my brief stay in Singapore I ate here numerous times and the food was the same all times. Will definitely be back when in Singapor
