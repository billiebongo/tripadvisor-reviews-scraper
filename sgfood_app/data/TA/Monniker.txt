Had a nice little relaxing time here, and the coffee was good. Will be back again for sure! Clean and comfy.

The coffee is awesome!!! I dont know why, but it just is. I tried the truffle fries which was OK , did not try any other food item there. I would go back there just for the coffee.

Good coffee and excellent food. Breakfast fit for ... was exactly that - very substantial but especially love the chicken waffle - quite creative.

Very interesting concept of inviting different home cooks to showcase their specially crafter menus.I attended the Menu by Chef Derrick Kwa. The menu was great and creative. Shows alot of skill that even a home cook might have! Foams and textures.Moniker is an industrial/steam punk theme. Very small seating area. But did not enjoy the ambience. Cold and not welcoming. Also, it wasn't very nice to have ordered a beverage, and to see someone run out to buy it from a nearby store. The least, make it discreet. Especially when 2 people on the same table ordered the same item and it came in different sizes. Overall, it was so-so. This considering the chefs and menus changes often. I will most likely come back if they have another home cook with another interesting menu. Or if Chef Derrick Kwa comes back for another stint. 5 stars for the Chef.3 stars for the venue (because the decorations and use of chrome themed items are pretty cool

We were there to pick up the honey baked ham we ordered for Christmas and decided to have dinner there since it wasn't crowded and ambiance was good. The restaurant was easily located in the Aqueen hotel. Visible from the main road.They recommended the chicken stack which looks like a chicken burger but instead of bread, it was waffles. The chicken fillet was fried and goes well with the waffles. We like it. We decided to order coffee after dinner as it started to rain and our car was parked further at the public car park. The coffee was very good. We felt so relaxed sipping a good cup of coffee in a little nice cosy restaurant, looking out the glass pane on a rainy day. Reasonable price too.The honey baked ham was also good and not salty. It came with a dish of roasted vegetables

A small cosy cafe on Balestier Rd that offers excellent coffee and variety of all day food entrees. Had the affagato coffee desert today , must say it was a refreshing after lunch pick me up . The ambience and music were great, comfortable place to chill and hang out . Service was warm and friendly, great coffee and food always

Monniker Cafe is clean, welcoming and has an industrial feel. The staff are very friendly and the meals are generous. We looked around and found the cafe by chance. After paying $7 a coffee for a double expresso, it was refreshing to find this place that has great coffee at half the price.We had breakfast there every morning, apart from the first morning where there was a misunderstanding with our order, we enjoyed our breakfasts there, hence our return every morning

We had truffle mushroom pesto with linguine, and prawn aglio olio with linguine. The pesto was fine but the mushrooms need to be less hard. No truffle flavour at all.The aglio olio was very bland. May be an issue with the olive oil they used, and certainly not enough garlic and chilli.We tried the recommended pandan gula Malacca sponge cake. The cake was rather dry and hard when I expected it to be soft and moist. The flavours were nice though. Perhaps it could be served warmed up.The owner is continuing to explore and innovate but needs more help with perhaps a better cook

Had a great breakfast in this little gem of a cafe. It sets itself apart immediately from the Cookie-cutter Cafes up the street at Zhongshan Mall by having great coffee, good value food (Wheeler's Cafe take note!) and a cool Steampunk Vibe in a little corner of the A-Queen Hotel (Copper, rivets and vintage maps... Very cool!). All their customers appeared to be nearby residents or drop-ins like us. Their big breakfast "Breakfast Fit For Captains" was huge for $22.00 and apparently very good. The Truffle Fries were a big hit and very well executed with smokey chopped mushrooms on top & aioli dip. As an Eggs Benedict fan, I had to try Monniker's offering ($17.00). Delicious!(although I wasn't a fan of the grilled sandwich ham). They have very good coffee best had Expresso or Long Black ($4.00). Will definitely be back when in the area. Lots of street parking or the public car park behind Boon Tong Kee restaurant.

Very good portion. Tried egg benedict: 2 eggs, 2 toasts, 2 hams, bacons and greens. Breakfast fit for captain is that plus sausage, hash brown, avocado... Too full to walk after that. Caffe Latte is excellent, very creamy and smooth. Vanilla milkshake is just delicious, filled to the brim.
