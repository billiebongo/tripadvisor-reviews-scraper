This place is really value for money..very fresh, hygienic and really tasty. I'd list are really soft n doses are fresh n crisp. More like a food court..very convenient for a quick meal in between office meetings

This place is great for Indians. Especially for vegetarians since veg food is not easily available. Yummy food - dosas, veg combo meals and snacks.

I come here for a quick and tasty South Indian food. Dosa, idli, poori etc are always high quality and fresh.
Also lassi are always tasty.
It's the perfect lunch in the city.

Tried the new outlet at Lau Pa Sat today to assess their masala tea. Fairly good product, although slightly more expensive than some of the regular tea competition in the neighbouring outlets ($1.80 vs just $1 in other stalls).

I give it 4 stars since it probably has the best Rava dosa in Singapore. This restaurant needs to be a little clean . It lacks basic hygiene as I saw that the same hand towel was used for wiping multiple tables and they didn't even clean the table with a disinfectant. The ambience is pathetic but serves the best food in town. My kids were not happy with the ambience and hence I had to cut it out for rest of my stay. I'll come back if they improve their hygiene. Definitely for single/ bachelors , it's a good place but not for family that's seriously wanting a quiet place with hygiene

This restaurant is located in the prime business district of Singapore. I have been going to this restaurant quite often in the recent days as this is the only vegetarian choice I have around this place. This restaurant offers great varieties of vegetarian food. North Indian thali is a must try. Mango lassi is my favorite drink.Little expensive compared to the other restaurants of the same chain, but it's worth it

Komala's restaurant on in Little India was like a home away from home during our stay. Location was great opposite Farrer part metro station which we used mostly for our local commute. The food was authentic south indian. Kids also enjoyed since it was not spicy. Only variety seemed to be lacking compared to other nearby similar restaurants. No combo options. We ended up ordering similar stuff most of the time like dosas and it was getting boring. Space was a bit lacking during peak hours. Otherwise, great place and great food
