Hope the owners consider reviving this restaurant somewhere down the road. Serves up interesting and good food!

It was with heavy heart that we had our last meal at pluck. Though many of their dishes were unanvailable, the ones we ordered were fantastic. We hope the owners will revive pluck somewhere down the road. All the best!

The foods are delicous üòã The grilled scallops with bakwa was so yummy, the scallop was tender. Also, the tom yum cereal Salmon & cold vermicelli were so special, delicious üëçüèªüëçüèª The beef ribeye strips taste nice , but the meat was slightly overcook
5
enjoyed their set lunch thoroughly. served up quality food at affordable prices. Was a little disappointed that we did not get to try their whitebait, but hey, all the more reasons to head back to pluck!
4
some of their dishes are very good. the tom yum cereal salmon is one of the dishes I have eaten in Singapore.
4
The staff helped us to get a seat quite easily and came to take our order quickly. Food was quite nice as well.
4
Quality food and prices were quite reasonable however service was pushy-- they kept coming back and asking if we want this or that, pushing us to drink alcohol even though i said i just wanted water/coke.
3
Our 3rd visit and the vermicelli noodles we once found addictive were not as we remembered. While the food was good, it's now missing the one thing that kept us coming back
4
will come again with my family. they serve good and interesting food. worth a second visit! will recommend.
4
We ordered a number of dishes to share and were satisfied with them all. Too bad there were other tapas we would have loved to order but they were already sold out. Service was friendly and efficient although one of the waiters was too enthusiastic in cleaning but not attentive enough, so food scraps were flying around as he cleared the tables. Some even flew in our face. Otherwise, a great evening
3
The menu looks interesting but food so so, too much fried stuff. Highly recommend pork belly and scallop with bak gua. Service was pretty good.
3
Small hole in the wall joint. Minimal seating. Outside can be very hot and muggy and many people smoking so if ur not a smoker don't sit outside. Wine is not bad but stingy pouring. Sometimes less than the standard
5
Fabulous superb primate anniversary
Very good meal Top DJ
Personnel very disponible
And good organization
4
The food was a pleasant surprise, and yummy. Cannot place a definitive cuisine style on the food but will be going back again. Good as sharing portions for 4-6 people.
4
Great lunch set! Space is small, Limited tables so good to make reservation prior to visit. Nice place for a little afternoon break.
4
We ordered the beef, coffee ribs and bee hoon. All were very tender and tasty. They all taste very different from what we usually would get from other restaurants. We would go back again for the food and the ambience is very cosy.
4
I tried the Tom Yum Cereal Salmon and the spicy Grilled Beef Ribeye which were both pluck signatures and they certainly did not disappoint! I would say the whole concept of pluck is like an upgraded zhi char store in a bar. Also, their cocktail choices were quite interesting
5
We ordered Spicy ribeye steak and Tomyam cereal Salmon, thinking that they would be plated as individual dinner. When the food arrived, they were in serving portions, i.e. dishes to share and go with rice. Interesting fushion style. We ordered a bowl of rice for sharing. Both our mains were tasty. So was the rice served with peanuts and garnishes. Dessert was equally yummy. We ordered pandan tiramisu and it was served with popcorn. Yummy dinner indeed.
3
You know when all first impressions were good but SOMETHING ruined the entire night?The 1-for-1 deal was (paradoxically) the problem.Enticed by the promo offered on Chope, I had no idea that the promo was only limited to 1 dish!Had I known earlier, I would have gotten half of my group of friends to make bookings, so as to score the 1-for-1 deal. It does not make sense, and on behalf of my friends, I declare that we were dumbfounded and reasonably upset towards the misrepresentation of the deal
4
We spent about 3hrs at the restaurant catching up with friends. We are all impressed with the food and enjoy the presentation. The only problem is that the chairs are metal and not particularly comfortable. There could also be more dessert options. Overall, it is still a good night out.
4
It was good but pricey for the portion and comparing to other restaurants that I went to in Singapore
5
We dined at pluck without much expectations but the dinner mains surpassed all our expectations. Highly recommend the beef!
3
Portions were extremely small, definitely not worth the price if not for the entertainer app. May return another time to try the dinner menu, since the salmon dish seems to be highly raved!
3
It's like tapas concept, small portion. Ordered the short ribs and salmon at $28 each. Turn out that these two main dishes were not filling for two adults. Also, the chef is too heavy handed on the salt.
4
Great food and good service. Had the vermicelli - fantastic, wish it was a larger serving. We also had the drunken chicken and sea bass. The sea bass was a rockstar, I would lick the bowl if I could.
4
Tried the chef's creative fusion of western and Asian cuisine! Tried the tomyum salmon and beef ribs - indeed must-try items from the menu!
5
Food was delicious and the ambience was great for chilling after a day of work. Service by the staff was good and prompt!
4
Space is a bit tight if prefer to sit indoors but plenty of space outdoors. Hippy chic vibe, food is definitely the biggest draw here. Try their fried rice on the side. It's good!
5
When you can't decide what you like to eat and just want a bit of everything with Asian flavors this is the place. First heard about it years ago through Survival Chic. Now also using Entertainer app to save money here. Portions are just perfect for sharing. Definitely get the rice. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Haven't had any dish here that wasn't a crowd pleaser so you can probably close your eyes and point at anything.
4
First timer in this area. One of few restaurants open throughout the day. Asian fusion with small plating. Not a restaurant dinner ambience as table and chairs are small. Uncomfortable during all chinawares and glassware seated on table. Service was good and happy hour till 6pm which all alcoholic beverage serve at 50% discount.
3
Food was alright although at that price point one would expect better value for money in terms of portion and taste.
5
Had the seabass in hk soy sauce and fried pork belly. With fragrance rice. Both were nice, staff were friendly and attentive.
3
Food was decent, rice was surprising good. They no longer do the lunch bikes though, and this should be updated on the Chope website
5
The servings were quite small but delicious. The food was served quickly too. Worth a visit. Couple of bars nearby too.
5
My husband, daughter and I enjoyed a lovely dinner n tried all the popular ones like Assam ribs n ribeye. Best were the juicy salted egg chicken wings n tom yum cereal salmon cooked just perfect. Nice friendly service too.
3
Ambiance is good. Fusion food. Food is good but portion too small for the price charging. Staff are friendly.
4
We went for dinner on a Tuesday night and the waiter was friendly and helpful in recommending dishes. We tried their signature Tom Yum Cereal Salmon and it was a unique combination of textures and flavours that worked for us as the crunch of the cereal complemented the tenderness of the salmon, and the slightly sour punch of the tom yum elevated the taste. The carbohydrates may be underrated as we enjoyed both the rice and vermicelli accompaniments to our dishes and they could very well stand alone. One gripe would be that the portions are relatively small for the price, but you could purchase 10% off vouchers via Chope to lessen the damage
3
This establishment has the possibility to be a great place however it lacks in a few areas. I love the look and feel of the whole place. Staff are very attentive, somewhat overattentive as they tend to hover over your shoulder waiting for your next move which was uncomfortable at times. The staff were very accommodating with our request to stagger the meal orders which worked out well as they came out very quickly anyway. The "modern Singapore cooking" menu is what captured me as I love a twist on classic meals. My partner and I ordered the rice as a staple which was very enjoyable. At first we were handed the vermicelli noodles by mistake which also looked to be quite appetising. We accompanied the rice with the golden pork belly and it was divine. Only complaint was there not being enough toasted rice sauce to go with the dish. Next out was the spicy grilled beef rib eye. I'm not sure why this dish is classified as a signature dish because it wasn't at all enjoyable. The spicy flavours are in the sauce but the meat was not at all tender. The meat was cooked medium as promised on the menu but it was chewy. Overall the evening was okay. It is in a great location and the atmosphere is pleasant but a few changes could really uplift this place.
3
There was a blackout when my companion and I dine there, they recovered it pretty fast though. Food was pretty salty and not really to our liking - ordered grilled mushrooms, salted egg wings and spicy cauliflowers. I would probably come back for the latter. Only that.
5
I had one of plucks's recommended dishes, tom yum Cereal Salmon. I liked how the salmon was coated with tom yum-infused cereal, tinge of sweetness amongst the sourness. Not too oily either, but the mentai mayonnaise lacked any bit of mentai taste. As for the scallop Cerviche, the Sashimi-grade Hokkaido scallops used were so fresh! The tangy lime dressing added a refreshing taste to the dish in all
5
Everyone loved the food, perfect portions. Service is good with nice informations about the current promotions.
I just love Pluck!
5
It was a business dinner, my client and colleagues enjoyed the food and experience thoroughly!
Will be back again soon.
4
Tried the spicy seared ribeye and tomyum cereal salmon. Together with fragrant rice. Yummy though have tasted better ones elsewhere. Good service though!
4
Some of the items are great, some are okay. However the portion is too little for the price. Recommended item is the spare ribs
3
Food is decent just not spectacular. Portions are small and I would not consider eating here as being bang for your buck. Relatively pleasant, attentive service
2
I brought my colleague there for lunch. Both of us had been there before separately. But somehow we couldn't remember which part along Club Street it was located. Now I know why. It was a forgettable experience for both of us. This time we ordered their prawn soup noodles. I was excited when they sent me an email flyer about it. And I quote what they wrote "...his (the chef) rendition of the prawn soup noodles is a superb twist of the evergreen Southeast Asian classic...". It was a "twist" alright...a bad one. The noodles were so soggy, prawns overcooked, pork loins over baked and dry and fish cake fried till rubbery. And finally, the baby clams that were supposed to be in it, were non-existent (may be they forgot it was in the flyer ad). And ambience? What ambience?
4
A very nice joint in Club Street. Small cosy and good service. They did not have fries on menu but gladly served us truffle fries on our request.The main course was in very small portion. More like appetizer. Really very small bite thought it's tasty. We manage to get a 1-for-1 for main course but still I feel it's expensive. If you don't get 1-for-1, it's totally not worth it. There is no happy hour or drinks promotion. The prosecco was at $80++ and beer at $15++ for a pint...indoor sitting is small and not very good ventilation ie you can smell the cooking in the open concept kitchen. Good to try but I'll not return
4
Visited this restaurant with 4 other girlfriends of mine one night last weekend. Thought it was too cosy for a party 5 as I expected a larger space for such a restaurant. Either way, the quality of food made up for it. However, speaking of the food, it was rather confusing - we weren't sure if each main was meant to be ordered with the choice of the 2 staples given, or was it just a regular add-on because as the mains were served, it was rather a small portion. If server could have educate us prior to making the orders, it would have been great. Nonetheless, if you are an adventurous foodie, please do give this place a try! Was spoilt for choices but none was disappointing. Will definitely come back again
2
Rice or vermicelli are offered as accompaniments to each dish but there was no vermicelli. We had a 1for1 offer on 'main' courses but as the dishes are small tapas style this wasn't the generous deal it sounded. To top it off, the service was lackadaisical and the place was empty and lacked atmosphere. Overall, it could do with being a bit more Plucky
4
I enjoyed the dishes which mainly had either Asian or specifically Thai influences. Notable orders were the Tom Yum Salmon which thankfully wasn't as spicy as I thought would be, and the scallop with bak kwa.Was served by lovely wait staff, particularly the female staff on duty who was very attentive and professional
4
Not bad. Definitely visit again. Dishes are common however the flavors are somewhat unique. The catch about this caf√© is probably the flavors and uniqueness in their blend of sauces etc.
5
Excellent, as usual.
The chef's creativity has no limit and the service is always super-friendly.
Going to pluck is like visiting some friends who can't wait to share their love of food and their culinary talent.
3
Heard a lot about this restaurant. Whatever we tried was quite decent, I liked the vermicelli. Service was alright too
5
Food was amazing. My friend had the tender pork and I ordered the mushroom bowl. Service was superb. Staff were attentive and friendly, and kept checking if we were alright :)
4
food was nice, portion was small though for the price paid .but price is reasonable after discount with chope
5
Ordered the tom yam cereal salmon and spicy ribeye. The vermicili was so good that we ordered seconds. Great food!
2
There was a Chope offer going on so we tried this place. I think we paid too much for vermicelli (really just bee Hoon and Chilli), and Western ingredients tossed in Asian sauce. Maybe this concept would work better in Europe, but not in melting pot singapore. Headed to a random restaurant nearby instead. So much better.
4
The portion of the food is just right~ I can taste the amount of efforts put in while eating the dish (grilled mushroom w baby corn) I ordered! More could be done to improve on the dessert quality.. In summary, mains and 10degreeC vermicelli are yumz!!
3
We visited Pluck last year and was pleasantly surprised by the food. It was really yummy and we went back for dinner. Lunch portions and price were reasonable but dinner portions and lunch portions are the same but 40% more expensive!Went back last week for lunch and the portions shrunk. The tako was also overcooked.
3
We met friends here for dinner. The place is better suited for snacking while having drinks rather than a whole meal. We had trouble with slow service, and the dishes while tasty were over-priced. Club Street has a neat vibe but you can find better value than this
5
Very good value for money, have some promotions ongoing. Do ask them! Modern twist on a lot of traditional dishes
4
Pluck is a pleasant place for diner. Fusion food is great and tasty. I would especially recommend trying their salmon and chilly crab!
4
Great food and I love the idea of having salmon coated with tom yum cereal but the portion was quite small.
4
Had the beef, pork ribs, salmon and tako. Everything was so good! It's kind of pricy for the portion but it's the quality that counts! Nice hangout place with friends!
5
The new menu is a must try and the service was nothing short of amazing! The chef was very friendly and came out to greet us
1
Lovely staff, which is their asset! However, since this is a restaurant, management seemingly are unprepared for feeding those who have reserved a table. Not good...
2
Went there for birthday dinner. Made reservation thru Chope 1 month in advance. But ended up seating along the street as there is a private event on the same day. pluck should have gave us a call to inform. The food is nice, but the portion is small and the service it not good. It took more than 20 mins to get our bill
5
We decided to try something new for New Year's Eve instead of always the same place for dinner. The place is good for casual dining with tables indoor and out on the street. We were recommended to choose dishes to share as it was supposed to be like tapas. And then a rice or noodles each. So Asian tapas ..? We had cereal salmon (amazing!), grilled squid (perfectly cooked) and grilled rib-eye (really tender) and some rice and noodles to share. The food came out really quick and the servers really attentive making sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend this place for dinner with friends or family. Also not too pricey!
4
The steak was excellent! Flavourful and chewy. The tom yum was a nice touch for the salmon but could do with a stronger accent. The soft shell crab was crisp. Shallot fried rice was surprisingly on point. The assam pork ribs were tender, though not memorable. Loved the Thai milk tea ice cream in the Thairamisu - intense tea flavour and not artificially sweetened. The portions are pretty small though and the prices rather steep without the 1 for 1 promotion.
4
Tried their assam pork ribs and tomyum cereal salmon. The pork ribs were tender but tasted like bbq ribs (couldn't really taste the assam) but was still nice. The tomyum cereal salmon was sensational. Salmon cooked just well done, cereal was very unique and appetising. Liked the mentaiko mayo with it too. The vermicelli and rice were very small in portion (3 mouthfuls), would have liked it if it were bigger because they are tasty on their own! Great quality food and servers were super attentive and nice. Thumbs up
3
the food was so flavourful.
the place is not baby friendly.
servers were nice and courteous.
i just hope they lessen their price a bit
2
The food is in pricey range but tastes just average. Ambiance and service was poor in general. I wouldn't come back.
3
Nice cozy bar for drinks and food were pleasant however kitchen only starts at 12.30pm but I wasn't informed upon my 12noon reservation. Vermicelli and the sticky rice with mango weren't available
4
The food was not too bad but portion was really small for the price. 4 adults and 1 child were only 60-70% full with five main dishes 1 sides and rice. Ambience was not too bad, generally the whole stretch over there has those "chill" ambience. Shop was kinda small and staff was really really quick to clear empty plates
5
My girlfriends and I had a greatlunch gathering at Pluck. We took advantage of the 1-for-1 mains as well as the 50% off on drinks promotions... Must say that food is tasty and service was great! Portions might be on the smaller side but nevertheless a good size for girls who are watching the scales! :
3
Would have given them a very good if they have gotten my reservation right. Anyway, it was an enjoyable meal which we had 4 dishes to share among 2. The scallop ceviche was tasty with an Asian twist. The beef was tender and the chilli complements it well. Our other 2 dishes of ribs and mushrooms were decent but nothing to rave about
2
Came here a year ago for my birthday with a bunch of friends. The menu was different and pricier than they advertised on their website. When asked, I was told un-apologetically that they had changed it. Shouldn't I have been told of this when making the reservation well in advance?We ordered steak, sides and appetizers anyway. The food was good, but the portions were miniscule. It was embarrassing for me as I had chosen the place - and my friends and I (about 15pax) ended up not full. We later went to the bar across the street for more snacks.The staff were nothing special to note. They did their jobs without initiative or smiles. The ambiance was small, and cramped. But they still managed to squeeze another table of 4 strangers into a corner. I felt duped coming here as the only reason its existence came to my attention was because my friend had a good lunch here. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone in the area as there are a lot better options for the same prices on the street
3
Nice food good service. But the main course portion a bit small, this is not fine dining place, expecting slightly bigger portion
4
Food was fresh, flavours were intense and service was casual. Didn't know why they didn't give us the Chop 1 for 1 promo even though we booked with that promo
4
Nice place to dine for dinner. Price abit too ex. But still worth coming back again. Waitress and waiter are helpful with the request
5
The staff were very attentive and always came to check on us. Because I was a return customer (they didn't have too but), they gave us 3 free dishes & 6 shots for free! Good experience and will definitely return :)
5
Good food, nice ambience and great service! We had the lunch set and their take on the ramly burger was pretty unique, with a delicious side of shaker spiced fries. Will be back :)
5
Interesting creative modern cuisine. Had been a few times and never disappoints and cheaper than similar restaurants like another favourite burnt ends. all the dishes tried were delicious. Surprisingly filling. Service is good and friendly. Got early for happy hour .
5
We randomly found this place while staying nearby. Great food, portions were a good size and easy to share between two of us. We had the soft shell crab and squid, both were very yummy. The cocktails were delicious! The staff were very friendly.
3
The flavours were wonderful but unfortunately the chef didn't quite nail it! The beef strips were so tough and chewy that we had to spit the remains into a tissue as we were not able to swallow it! (Yuck!) When I mentioned this to the waiter, he said "this is how it's supposed to be". Odd. For the price, I expected a more tender cut of beef. The raspberry gin and tonic was delicious and I really liked the flavours of the vermicelli.
2
Very disappointing. Cooking gone wrong with thankfully small portions. Nice beer but cocktails all over the place. We went somewhere else afterwards for a cheese platter.
4
Terrific Asian fusion cuisine served outside overlooking the virtually pedestrian zone of Club Road in the evening. Pluck seems to be mainly a bar with a nice cocktail selection, but the menu is really terrific. Some of the more creative items include Tom Yom Lobster and Scallop Roll (yea, that's a thing - and it's totally awesome) and curry spiced cauliflower. Modern SE Asia cuisine in a great setting with great music on a great street. Excellent experience.
4
Lunch set was affordable and changes regularly (monthly?)Clearly its an after work kinda place and so was not packed at lunch. Ate with couple of colleagues and we were all impressed by what we ordered, all different but good. I had the Chicken (deep fried cutlet) in Thai Green Curry. Whilst the chicken could be larger, and could have used a bit more curry, the flavours were good
5
12 Singapore dollars for a terrific lunch. For the vegetarian: a tofu satay with quail eggs and pineapple that melds classic Asian flavors with modern thinking. For the meat eater: great fried chicken with green curry. (Two other meat options are available.) The price includes water with cucumber slices and a drink (juice, soda, tea, or coffee). Food is cooked when you order it and the service couldn't be nicer. Go
4
A couple of friends and I visited Pluck before embarking on a night out on Club Street and had a really good time. The whole concept of Pluck is to share your food which worked perfectly for me as I wanted everything on the menu! Everything was really yummy and just the right size, in particular the Pork Belly stood out, while the Corn-Fed Chicken and Gnocchi was also very good. I shall certainly be returning to Pluck, there was a really cool crowd, a good atmosphere and the food was very reasonable priced; a perfect start to our night out
