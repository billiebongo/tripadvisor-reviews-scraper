The set meals are delicious. It comes with salad and chawanmushi. Tempura set is not oily at all. Unagi portion is generous and well marinated. Prices are very reasonable too!

5 petty sushi,misojiru Grilled shiitake and skin cost me SGD30. Grilled stuff are all burnt food are all burnt. Sushi tasted horrible and the portion between fish and rice are all wrong. The staffs couldn't care less about their service and food. Such a disappointment.

We had a quick dinner here with family and were very impressed, sliced beef was delicious and went down well with a beer. Loved the chawamushi too!
Staff friendly and service pretty quick, no complaints at all!

I love Udon, but not many places in Singapore serves good Udon. Besides Tsuru-Koshi Udon at Takashimaya, I thought Kai Sushi & Grill serves decent Udon too.

Simple and good Japanese meals served, with a pretty varieties to choose from.
Restaurant was clean and tidy.
Service was efficient.

It is a rather popular resturant during lunch hour and large crowd is advise to go earlier. Food is serve fast which is good during lunch hour rush. The waitress is attentive and clear off my plates when the starters are finished or refill the tea without me having to ask. I had the chirashi and the sashimi is fresh, serving is decent. The sashi selection provided in the chirashi is quite a variety

Had lunch for the second time at this Japanese restaurant. Food wise, this restaurant scores high with good taste, fresh ingredients and reasonable presentation. However, staff's knowledge of the menu is really limited. When I pointed to a picture with the description as "dried flat fish" and asked the waitress for more information. She just read out the description to me. She can't be serious that when I spoke to her in English, she could presumed that I can't read a menu that's in English. Anyway, wouldn't recommend ordering this dish as it's available in packet form on the supermarket's shelves. What the restaurant did was probably to warm it up and serve it on a nice-looking dish. Service at this restaurant is just like my previous visit - Tremendously Slow. There's probably a good 10 minutes between the soup and appetizer before the main dish of my ordered set meal arrived. Price-wise, the restaurant's offerings is acceptable but they certainly need to improve speed of food serving and waiting service level

Friday evening; had to go to Plaza... Then elected to have dinner there.food wise, Kai was average : tuna sashimi not really top but not so expensive, swordfish good, roll also good. skewers basic and clearly on the small side.service 8pm was down. dishes arrive randomly, and on my 5 orders 3 where wrongly taken (while pointing the picture on the menu... i wonder). of course replaced without problem, yet still with the question "you ordered chicken skewers, i bring you chicken skin and you ask about it... euh, is it ok to keep the skin ? no ? Ok..."ambiance not so great... tables are in the middle of the floor of a shopping mall, with patrons queuing next to you on the other side of the fence. can find better..

Loved the chirashi don and skewers since my first visit many years back. Though the chirashi don is not the cheapest in town, it is fresh! The skewers are also well-grilled and reasonably priced. They have 2 outlets in plaza singapura, one at B2 and one at Level 4. The level 4 is more spacious and good for groups

Although it may say set 'lunch', it is available for dinner as well. I usually order the beef set which comes with rice, beef slices ( I usually request for medium rare), salad dressed with Japanese dressing, chawanmushi and miso soup. The add on side of sashimi was not worth it to me because the slices were so small. The teriyaki chicken set is not bad too
4
Not bad but not good.Maybe I should try beef grill next time.
They have promotion for take-away sushi. $10 for 2, which seems delicious.

I like Wakadori teriyaki set meal here. The chicken teriyaki is delicious different from other restaurant. The portion size is also quite fulfilling. I recommend this restaurant if you visit Plaza Singapura.

Tanuki greats you at the entrance and friendly efficient staff that seats you almost immediately.
Lunch sets are well priced and plentiful. Fresh ingredients that are well seasoned and plentiful. Umami was the sesame dressing on the house salad!

I had a quick sushi lunch alone here. I asked for a table away from the front counter and grill as I didn't want my clothes to smell as I had an important meeting after that. The maitre'd met that request in a surly manner. Otherwise the wait staff were alright, but needed prompting to refill my tea.The sushi platter was very average. I was not happy with the quality as the sushi rice was poorly molded and kept dropping before I could bring each sushi to my mouth. Prices are average for Orchard. I don't think I'll be back

It has been visits after visits and with various groups of people. We even met our friends with their family members at the restaurant after being so impressed with the food during our gatherings. The only negative takeaway is that there is actually a long queue for this restaurant which is increasingly gaining reputation amongst those who have tried it. Price and quality wise, the food is one of the better ones in the market! I especially like the grilled beef and chicken sets. My partner and I will occasionally indulge in the sushi, which is not the cheapest in town nor the best, and the grills, which is actually really good given that it is their specialty. Do give it a try

The first time I visited this restaurant was in April, when business was still bad and the manager had to promote the restaurant while walking around the vicinity. My partner and I were not exactly hungry that evening and we decided to entertain the sincere manager who went all out to promote the food. It turned out to be a great decision!A few months down the road, I have returned quite a few times, to try different items, and my favourite will still be the grilled beef! Portions are generous and flavours are strong. My partner prefers the Chirashi-don and the sushi. We have since brought various groups of friends and family to the restaurant and most were surprised by the quality of food from a restaurant located in the middle of nowhere. Will definitely return despite the growing crowd

We had dinner reservations at 730pm but when we arrived 2 minutes before time, apparently they 'lost/forgot' our reservations. A bit of a shocker.But they made attempts to clear and get a table back for the 4 of us. They seemed overwhelmed as the crowd and queue built up.Food was fine and the waitress did her best to make up for the lost reservations. And surprisingly we were given a complimentary bowl of salmon sushi, perhaps to make up for the earlier hiccup.Well saved

I had dinner with friends here on a Friday night. The queue was long and the wait took more than half an hour and since there we're only 3 of us, we settled for the bar seats which was faster for us to get our seats. Service was pretty quick and efficient. One of my friend had the Chirashi Don which she highly recommend while I took the Gyu Don. Both of us took the Sapporo bottled beer promotion which cost only $5. The meal was served with the usual yummy miso soup, chawanmushi and a little side appetiser seaweed dish. I must say the portion is decent but perhaps a little small for a big eater though. The beef was really yummy though the sweet teriyaki sauce was a little too sweet to my palate. Another friend who had the Gyu Udon Soup (without the sauce) said her meal was pretty good too.All in all, a pleasant dining experience, though you may need to wait for a table on a crowded weekend night

Just wondered into this place by chance. Was greeted warmly by someone (didn't get his name, sorry!). Surprised that the food ordered was delivered fast since it was right smack in the middle of lunch hour, 1230pm. And the food quality is great. had the katsu don set (deep friend chicken with rice and egg), yakitori, agedeshi toufu. very big portions. delicious. Thinking of going back if I am in Singapore again. Never had this feeling for Japanese food in KL before. Staff are also very efficient in refilling water/tea. Clears tables quickly so customers don't have to wait long, and never noticed any staff getting annoyed while working. Great to have this group of staffs' dedication

Can here twice for lunch in the past week.Ordered the Chirashi Don set for about $23++. Came with 1 amaebi, otoro sake, ikura, a small dollop of uni, maguro and mekajiki. Oishii!2nd time I was a bit more thrifty, ordered the the sushi don (can't remember what they called it) for about $15++. 1 amaebi and the rest were cubes of mekajiki, maguro and sake. Still very good.Looks like I'll be coming back quite often
